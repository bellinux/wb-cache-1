5|$|The AV-8B Harrier II is a subsonic attack {{aircraft}} {{of metal}} and composite construction that retains the basic layout of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, with horizontal stabilizers and shoulder-mounted wings featuring prominent <b>anhedral</b> (downward slope). The aircraft {{is powered by a}} single Rolls-Royce Pegasus turbofan engine, which has two intakes and four synchronized vectorable nozzles close to its turbine. Two of these nozzles are located near the forward, cold end of the engine and two are near the rear, hot end of the engine. This arrangement contrasts with most fixed-wing aircraft, which have engine nozzles only at the rear. The Harrier II also has smaller valve-controlled nozzles in the nose, tail, and wingtips to provide control at low airspeeds.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} swept wing all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable rear section for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots {{and has a}} single jetpipe {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35° and slight <b>anhedral,</b> the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{similarity}} of the IAe-27a and Tank's redesign of the Ta 183, Juan Ignacio San Martín, {{the director of the}} Institute merged the two parallel projects as the IAe 33 Pulqui II. The fuselage of Tank's design was further adapted to use the IAe-27a's undercarriage. The shoulder-mounted, negative-incidence wings were swept back 40°, an even greater sweep angle than that of the Ta 183, and given a small amount of <b>anhedral.</b> Comparable to the Ta 183's engine placement, the Nene engine was situated aft of the cockpit, near the center of gravity with engine maintenance and service facilitated through the removal of the tail section. The airframe featured a graceful, 50° swept-back T-shaped empennage and a pressurized cockpit topped by a clear bubble-type canopy, faired into the dorsal fuselage. Armor was provided around the cockpit and a bulletproof windscreen was incorporated. Fuel capacity was initially 1,250 l (275 Imp. gal.) internally and 800 l (176 Imp. gal.) in the wings. Armament was planned to include four 20mm cannon, a pair mounted in a staggered, near-ventral position along each side of the fuselage slightly set back from the jet intake.|$|E
50|$|He 162C — {{proposed}} upgrade {{featuring the}} B-series fuselage, Heinkel HeS 011A engine, swept-back, <b>anhedraled</b> outer wing panels forming a gull wing, a new V-tail stabilizing surface assembly, and upward-aimed twin 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108s as a Schräge Musik weapons fitment, located {{right behind the}} cockpit.|$|R
5000|$|The {{third and}} fourth prototypes, which now used an [...] "M" [...] for [...] "Muster" [...] (model) number instead of [...] "V" [...] for [...] "Versuchs" [...] (experimental) number, as the He 162 M3 and M4, after being fitted with the {{strengthened}} wings, flew in mid-January 1945. These versions also included — as possibly the pioneering example of their use on a production-line, military jet aircraft — small, <b>anhedraled</b> aluminium [...] "drooped" [...] wingtips, reportedly designed by Alexander Lippisch and known in German as Lippisch-Ohren ("Lippisch Ears"), {{in an attempt to}} cure the stability problems via effectively [...] "decreasing" [...] the main wing panels' marked three degree dihedral angle. Both prototypes were equipped with two 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 cannons in the He 162 A-1 anti-bomber variant; in testing, the recoil from these guns proved to be too much for the lightweight fuselage to handle, and plans for production turned to the A-2 fighter with two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons instead while a redesign for added strength started as the A-3. The shift to 20 mm guns was also undertaken because the smaller-calibre weapons would allow a much greater amount of ammunition to be carried.|$|R
25|$|The Corsair's {{aerodynamics}} were {{an advance}} over those of contemporary naval fighters. The F4U {{was the first}} U.S. Navy aircraft to feature landing gear that retracted into a fully enclosed wheel well. The landing gear oleo struts — each with their own strut door enclosing them when retracted — rotated through 90° during retraction, with the wheel atop {{the lower end of}} the strut when retracted; a pair of rectangular doors enclosed each wheel well, leaving a streamlined wing. This swiveling, aft-retracting landing gear design was common to the Curtiss P-40 (and its predecessor, the Curtiss P-36), as adopted for the F4U Corsair's main gear and its erstwhile Pacific War counterpart, the Grumman F6F Hellcat. The oil coolers were mounted in the heavily <b>anhedraled</b> center-section of the wings, alongside the supercharger air intakes, and used openings in the leading edges of the wings, rather than protruding scoops. The large fuselage panels were made of aluminum and were attached to the frames with the newly developed technique of spot welding, thus mostly eliminating the use of rivets. While employing this new technology, the Corsair was also the last American-produced fighter aircraft to feature fabric as the skinning for the top and bottom of each outer wing, aft of the main spar and armament bays, and for the ailerons, elevators and rudder. The elevators were also constructed from plywood. The Corsair, even with its streamlining and high speed abilities, could fly slowly enough for carrier landings with full flap deployment of 60°.|$|R
25|$|Euhedral {{crystals}} {{are those}} with obvious, well-formed flat faces. <b>Anhedral</b> crystals do not, usually because the crystal is one grain in a polycrystalline solid.|$|E
25|$|Like the Tupolev Tu-134, the Tu-154 has a wing {{swept back}} at 35° at the quarter-chord line. The British Hawker Siddeley Trident {{has the same}} {{sweepback}} angle, while the Boeing 727 has a slightly smaller sweepback angle of 32°. The wing also has <b>anhedral</b> (downward sweep) which is a distinguishing feature of Russian low-wing airliners designed during this era. Most Western low-wing airliners such as the contemporary Boeing 727 have dihedral (upward sweep). The <b>anhedral</b> means that Russian airliners have poor lateral stability compared to their Western counterparts, but also have weaker Dutch roll tendencies.|$|E
25|$|Dihedral, or a {{positive}} wing {{angle to the}} horizontal, increases spiral stability around the roll axis, whereas <b>anhedral,</b> or a negative wing angle to the horizontal, decreases spiral stability.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Chaika was adapted as a {{reconnaissance}} aircraft and emerged as the Myasishchev M-17 Stratosphera with a revised airframe, including straight tapered wings with 2° 30' <b>anhedral</b> (0° at 1g), shorter fuselage pod and unreheated Kolesov RD-36-51 turbojet engine. Flown {{for the first time}} on 26 May 1982, the M-17 prototype (regn CCCP 17401) was soon allocated the NATO reporting name Mystic-A and was used for investigating the Ozone layer over Antarctica in 1992.|$|E
25|$|The wing had {{a span of}} , with a {{wing area}} of 279 sq ft (29.6 sq m). It was {{designed}} {{with a small amount}} of inverted gull wing bend; the inner sections had a 1° <b>anhedral,</b> while the outer sections, attached just outboard of the undercarriage legs, had a dihedral of 5½°. The airfoil was a NACA 22 wing section, with a thickness to chord ratio of 19.5% at the root tapering to 12% at the tip.|$|E
25|$|The La-15 had a barrel-like fuselage, shoulder-mounted swept wings with 6 degrees <b>anhedral,</b> and {{stabilizers}} mounted {{high on the}} fin, {{almost a}} T-tail. It was popular with pilots because of its easy handling and reliability, and its pressurized cockpit was an advantage at high altitude. Nevertheless, official enthusiasm for the La-15 was mild, largely {{because it was a}} complex design that required complicated and expensive production tooling. Only 235 La-15s were built, serving with the Soviet Air Force until 1953.|$|E
25|$|The wooden, cantilever, two-spar {{wing of the}} U 7 {{was almost}} {{trapezoidal}} in plan, with sweep on the leading edge, out to ellipsoidal tips. It also thinned outwards in section {{with most of the}} taper on the upper surface, giving some <b>anhedral.</b> Short ailerons extended to the tips. The wing was mounted over the fuselage on six streamlined steel struts; two upright tripods ran from the forward spar to points on the upper and mid fuselage and two inverted V-struts joined the rear spar to the upper fuselage.|$|E
25|$|To {{accommodate}} a folding wing the designers considered retracting the {{main landing gear}} rearward but, for the chord of wing that was chosen, {{it was difficult to}} make the landing gear struts long enough to provide ground clearance for the large propeller. Their solution was an inverted gull wing, which considerably shortened the required length of the main gear legs. The <b>anhedral</b> of the wing's center-section also permitted the wing and fuselage to meet at the optimum angle for minimizing drag, without using wing root fairings. The bent wing, however, was heavier and more difficult to construct, offsetting these benefits.|$|E
25|$|Crystal habit {{refers to}} the overall shape of crystal. Several terms are used to {{describe}} this property. Common habits include acicular, which described needlelike crystals like in natrolite, bladed, dendritic (tree-pattern, common in native copper), equant, which is typical of garnet, prismatic (elongated in one direction), and tabular, which differs from bladed habit in that the former is platy whereas the latter has a defined elongation. Related to crystal form, the quality of crystal faces is diagnostic of some minerals, especially with a petrographic microscope. Euhedral crystals have a defined external shape, while <b>anhedral</b> crystals do not; those intermediate forms are termed subhedral.|$|E
500|$|The wing was {{the most}} unusual feature. It {{consisted}} of a single center section and two outer sections installed using four universal joints. The center section had a large negative dihedral (<b>anhedral)</b> and the outer surfaces a positive dihedral. This created the inverted gull, or [...] "cranked", wing pattern along the Ju 87's leading edge. The shape of the wing improved the pilot's ground visibility and also allowed a shorter undercarriage height. The center section protruded by only [...] on either side.|$|E
500|$|After {{extensive}} {{wind tunnel}} testing, the stabilator was mounted {{at the top}} of the fin for optimum stability and control about the pitch axis. Because the vertical tail fin was only slightly shorter than the length of each wing and nearly as aerodynamically effective, it could act as a wing on rudder application (a phenomenon known as [...] "Dutch roll"). To offset this effect, the wings were angled downward to give 10° <b>anhedral.</b> The rudder was manually operated and supplemented by a small yaw damper surface mounted at the bottom of the fin.|$|E
500|$|YF-96A aka YF-84F aka YRF-84K: F-84E 49-2430 {{converted}} to swept wing configuration. The [...] "first prototype" [...] for the F-84F Thunderstreak. Canopy and ventral speed brake carried over from Thunderjet. Originally with a V-windscreen, later reverted {{to the standard}} Thunderjet flat windscreen. Modified by adding a fixed hook at the weapons bay and <b>anhedral</b> horizontal tailplane to enable FICON tests (trapeze capture) with GRB-36D mother ship. The airframe was capable of higher speeds than the Thunderjet engine could deliver. The YF-84F was a follow on with a larger engine and deepened fuselage.|$|E
500|$|The {{fuel system}} {{comprised}} two fuel tanks between the main (forward) and rear spars of the (inner) <b>anhedral</b> wing {{section of the}} port and starboard wings, each with [...] capacity. The tanks also had a predetermined limit which, if passed, would warn the pilot via a red warning light in the cockpit. The fuel was injected via a pump from the tanks to the power plant. Should this shut down, it could be pumped manually using a hand-pump on the fuel cock armature. The powerplant was cooled by a , ring-shaped aluminium water container situated between the propeller and engine. A further container of [...] was positioned under the engine.|$|E
500|$|On 2 November 1960, the Ministry of Supply {{issued a}} {{contract}} for a further four prototypes to be produced, which were intended to develop the aircraft further towards being a realistic combat design, such as the refinement of the wing, engine improvements, and of accompanying operational equipment. Throughout this period, improved models of the Pegasus engine were rapidly developed, such as the Pegasus 3 being capable of 15,000lbf (67kN) of thrust. Apart from the improved powerplants, the first four P.1127 prototypes were quite similar; the fifth prototype, XP980, introduced the taller fin and tailplane <b>anhedral</b> which were later used on the production Harrier. The fourth machine was partially used to provide Hawker production test pilots with type familiarisation. [...] The first carrier vertical landing was performed by the first prototype on [...] in 1963. The last P.1127, XP984, introduced the swept wing. It was eventually fitted with the 15,000lbf (66.7kN) Pegasus 5 and functioned as the prototype Kestrel.|$|E
500|$|Wind tunnel testing had {{revealed}} lateral instability requiring {{the addition of}} 5° dihedral to the wings. To avoid redesigning the titanium central section of the aircraft, McDonnell engineers angled up only the outer portions of the wings by 12°, which averaged to the required 5° over the entire wingspan. The wings also received the distinctive [...] "dogtooth" [...] for improved control at high angles of attack. The all-moving tailplane was given 23° of <b>anhedral</b> to improve control at high angles of attack while still keeping the tailplane clear of the engine exhaust. In addition, air intakes were equipped with variable geometry ramps to regulate airflow to the engines at supersonic speeds. All-weather intercept capability was achieved thanks to the AN/APQ-50 radar. To accommodate carrier operations, the landing gear was designed to withstand landings with a sink rate of , while the nose strut could extend by some [...] to increase angle of attack at takeoff.|$|E
500|$|The thin {{wing and}} the 2° <b>anhedral</b> {{necessary}} {{to cure the}} excessive lateral stability limited the amount of fuel that could be carried and tip tanks were required to meet the range requirement. The slim engine nacelles did not allow the main landing gear to be stowed there as {{was done in the}} Il-28. The solution was to house them within the fuselage — the first bicycle landing gear on a Soviet aircraft — with small, twin-wheeled, outriggers mounted underneath the nacelles to stabilize the aircraft on the ground. The aircraft had a crew of four, the pilot, a bombardier, and two gunners. The pilot, bombardier and the dorsal gunner shared one pressurized compartment that was subdivided into the cockpit and the bombardier's position in the extensively glazed nose. The dorsal gunner was placed back-to-back with the pilot, underneath the canopy, and the tail gunner had his own separate pressurized compartment {{at the rear of the}} aircraft. Defensive armament was six [...] Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 cannon, two fixed forward and one pair each in the Il-V-12 dorsal turret immediately behind the cockpit and the Il-K6 tail turret. Maximum bomb load was ...|$|E
500|$|The new design, {{given the}} company {{designation}} B-48, was known unofficially by Blackburn as the [...] "Firecrest" [...] but was always {{known by its}} specification number by the Air Ministry and Navy. It was a low-winged, single-seat, all-metal monoplane. Aft of the cockpit the fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin semi-monocoque, but forward it had a circular-section, tubular-steel frame. The cockpit of the Firecrest was moved forward and raised the pilot's position so that he now looked over the wing leading edge, and down the nose. The canopy was adapted from the Hawker Tempest fighter. In the rear fuselage was a single [...] fuel tank with two [...] fuel tanks in the centre wing section. The aircraft had a redesigned, thinner, inverted gull wing of laminar flow aerofoil section. The wing consisted of a two-spar centre section with just over 6.5 degrees of <b>anhedral</b> and outer panels with 9 degrees of dihedral. It could be hydraulically folded in two places to allow more compact storage in the hangar decks of aircraft carriers. Four Fowler flaps were fitted to give good low-speed handling for landing and the wing had retractable dive brakes on both surfaces. In {{the course of the}} redesign the structure was simplified which reduced weight by 1,400lb (635kg) and even after the fuel capacity was increased by [...] the gross weight was still [...] less than that of the Firebrand.|$|E
2500|$|The G-4 Super Galeb was {{developed}} {{as a replacement for}} the G-2 Galeb, which had been the most commonly used jet trainer aircraft of the Yugoslav Air Force up until 1990. The first of two prototypes was [...] completed by early 1978. Following completion of the initial testing phase, the first flight was achieved on 17 July 1978 and the first of six pre-production aircraft on 17 December 1980. These and the first prototype were designated G-4 PPP, and had fixed tailplanes with inset elevators and no <b>anhedral.</b> Production examples (and the second prototype) were designated G-4 and featured an all-moving <b>anhedral</b> tailplane and comprehensive avionics improvements. The G-4 first flew in 1983 and has been ordered in large numbers for the Yugoslav Air Force.|$|E
2500|$|To combat these high-altitude balloons, Myasishchev {{proposed}} Subject 34 a single-seat turbojet-powered twin-boom high-aspect-ratio aircraft, nicknamed Chaika ("Seagull" [...] in Russian) {{due to its}} <b>anhedral</b> wing design. Armament of the single-seat balloon interceptor was to {{have been}} two air-air missiles (AAM) and two GSh-23 cannon with 600rpg in a dorsal turret. Before Subject 34 could be developed into operational hardware, the threat receded due {{to the success of the}} Keyhole reconnaissance satellites of the Corona program and the emergence of the Lockheed A-12.|$|E
2500|$|All {{three were}} inverse delta aircraft, that is {{they had a}} wing which was {{triangular}} in plan but with a straight, unswept leading edge. Combined with strong <b>anhedral,</b> this layout produces stable flight in ground effect. Specifically, it is claimed that it is stable in pitch and also that it can fly in ground effect at altitudes up to about 50% of its span, allowing it to operate over rough water. [...] This contrasts with the lower aspect ratio square wing of the Ekranoplans which leaves ground effect at only 10% of span, limiting them to the calmer waters of lakes and rivers.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{designed}} to meet Air Ministry specification C.16/28, which required the ability to carry 30 troops and their equipment for 1,200 miles (1,930km) and was the same specification that produced the Handley Page H.P.43 and the Vickers Type 163. [...] The TC.33 was a large single bay biplane with no stagger and 7° sweepback. [...] Both wings had metal lattice spars and metal ribs with fabric covering. [...] The lower wing was unusual in that its centre section had marked <b>anhedral</b> so that the main spars met {{at the top of}} the fuselage, leaving the interior unobstructed. A similar arrangement, though with less <b>anhedral</b> was used by the slightly earlier Handley Page H.P.42 airliner. The outer end of this centre section was strut braced to the lower fuselage. The TC.33 was also unusual in having a lower wing of (slightly) greater span than the upper; most unequal span wings had a larger upper wing. The four evaporatively cooled Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines were mounted in two nacelles, each containing a tractor-pusher pair together with their steam condenser and mounted between the wings at the end of the centre section. They were each carried by two vertical struts above the nacelle, complicated strutting below and by further strutting to the lower wing roots. The wide (22ft 6 in (6.8 m)) split axle undercarriage had vertical legs from the front wing spar at the same point and bracing from the axles to the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|The X-113 was {{an inverse}} delta aircraft; that is, {{it had a}} wing which was {{triangular}} in plan but with a straight, unswept leading edge. Combined with strong <b>anhedral,</b> this layout produces stable flight in ground effect. Specifically, it is claimed that it is stable in pitch and also that it can fly in ground effect at altitudes up to about 50% of its span, allowing it to operate over rough water. [...] This contrasts with the lower aspect ratio square wing of the Ekranoplans which leaves ground effect at only 10% of span, limiting them to the calmer waters of lakes and rivers.|$|E
2500|$|The two-seat {{version was}} {{modified}} into the S-52-2, a four-seat helicopter using a 245hp (183kW) Franklin O-425-1 air-cooled flat-six. It had a semi-monocoque fuselage of pod-and-boom arrangement {{with a large}} bubble-like front greenhouse,a three-blade rotor, and quadricycle fixed landing gear. The production S-52-3 (HO5S-1) incorporated a downward sloping (<b>anhedral)</b> v-tail stabilizer. [...] It also had sliding doors on the right forward and left rear sides, and a vertically split front bubble, allowing the left half to swing open in a clamshell fashion. The engine was placed at the aft end of the cabin and was canted forward 30 degrees to couple with the clutch and transmission. [...] The pilot-in-command occupied the right front seat.|$|E
2500|$|Barnard {{also helped}} design the Benetton B191 for the [...] season, {{assisted}} by the team's new designer Mike Coughlan. The B191, {{which was the}} first Benetton to use the raised <b>anhedral</b> front profile pioneered by the Tyrrell team in 1990 (the Tyrrell 019 was designed by Harvey Postlethwaite) and has since become standard on nearly all open wheel racing cars, carried Piquet to his 23rd and final Grand Prix win in Canada. After completing the Benetton B192 for the [...] season (with assistance from Rory Byrne and Ross Brawn), in which future 7 time World Champion Michael Schumacher would take his first ever Grand Prix win in Belgium, Barnard left Benetton after a dispute with team boss Flavio Briatore over money.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first of}} the Type 544s serving as prototypes for the later {{production}} series flew on 19 January 1956. The aircraft evolved more with the third Type 544 incorporating different aerodynamic changes and a stronger airframe for the new low level role - to quote Flight; [...] "To permit uninhibited manoeuvring in thick turbulent air at low levels while carrying heavy loads of strike weapons, the structure is extremely sturdy". Various aerodynamic [...] "fixes" [...] to try and counter pitch-up effects at high speed and altitude included flared-out wing tips and wing fences. The tailplane was also changed from dihedral to <b>anhedral.</b> The combined modifications led to the final Type 544 being considered the [...] "production standard". The first production Scimitar flew on 11 January 1957.|$|E
2500|$|In Royal Navy service, {{because of}} the limited hangar deck height in several classes of British carrier, many Corsairs had their outer wings [...] "clipped" [...] by [...] to clear the deckhead. The change in span brought about {{the added benefit of}} {{improving}} the sink rate, reducing the F4U's propensity to [...] "float" [...] {{in the final stages of}} landing. Despite the clipped wings and the shorter decks of British carriers, Royal Navy aviators found landing accidents less of a problem than they had been to U.S. Navy aviators, thanks to the curved approach they used: British units solved the landing visibility problem by approaching the carrier in a medium left-hand turn, which allowed the pilot to keep the carrier's deck in view over the <b>anhedral</b> in the left wing root. This technique was later adopted by U.S. Navy and Marine fliers for carrier use of the Corsair.|$|E
2500|$|The Vickers Type 253 used a Pegasus IIM3 engine, {{enclosed}} by a drag-reducing Townend ring, to power a two-bay, unstaggered biplane, {{with a lower}} wing smaller in span and chord. [...] Both wings were of constant chord, but the centre sections were mildly forward-swept and the lower centre section carried <b>anhedral</b> out to the inner interplane struts. Both sets of interplane struts leaned outwards, the outer ones more so. Both wings carried ailerons and the upper planes had leading edge slats. [...] The wings joined the fuselage top and bottom with no gap, the pilot sitting {{just ahead of the}} leading edge in an open cockpit and the observer sitting well behind the trailing edge. A conventional tail carried balanced rudder and elevators. The split-axle fixed undercarriage was neatly mounted, the main legs fixed to the front spar under the inner interplane struts and braced rearwards to the wing roots.|$|E
2500|$|The Kestrel had thick wings, perhaps {{influenced}} by the experiments with the Miles Hawcon, with a root thickness to chord ratio of about 23%. They had inverted gull form, with <b>anhedral</b> inboard, giving way to dihedral on the outer part. The wings carried ailerons immediately outboard of Miles split trailing edge flaps in two sections on each wing. The main undercarriage was attached at the lowest point of the wing, keeping the legs short; they retracted backwards, with the wheels rotating into {{the plane of the}} wings. A tail wheel was fitted. Both rudder and elevators were horn balanced and fitted with trim tabs. The aircraft was wooden throughout, with spruce frames covered in beech ply and a doped fabric sheath. Instructor and pupil sat in tandem under a simple perspex canopy, with the minimum of framing and with extra clear panels in the fuselage sides behind the rear seat. [...] The forward seat was positioned at about mid-chord. The 745hp (556kW) Kestrel engine drove a three-bladed propeller and had a chin radiator under the nose.|$|E
2500|$|The TSR.38 was {{a fabric}} covered all metal machine with steel sparred wings with {{duralumin}} and steel ribs. It {{was a single}} bay biplane with staggered wings of almost equal span and sharp, 10° sweepback. [...] The airfoils were thick, the lower thicker and the upper wings carried leading edge automatic slots for low speed control. [...] The wings could be folded from the centre section for carrier stowage. The lower wing centre section had <b>anhedral</b> to allow a shorter undercarriage and also carried a pair of underwing radiators. [...] The undercarriage was of the fixed, split axle type required for torpedo launches, with torpedo crutches between the legs {{and there was a}} small, spatted tailwheel. [...] For carrier landing there was a hinged arrestor hook ending {{just in front of the}} tailwheel. The three crew sat in separate open cockpits, the pilot in front under a cut-out in the upper wing trailing edge, his navigator behind him and furthest aft the gunner with a Lewis gun on a Scarff ring. [...] The fin was large and rounded with a generous rudder, a little like that of the later Gladiator, with the tailplane braced from above to the fin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{weight of}} the X-114 was {{more than twice that}} of the X-112, the next {{heaviest}} of the series, but all three shared the same control systems. [...] At each wing tip there was a long, flat bottomed float reaching forward about [...] beyond the wing leading edge, [...] with short, outward leaning winglets in line with that edge and fitted with ailerons. [...] At the rear the fuselage swept upwards to a conventional fin and T-tail, the latter carrying elevators. [...] On the water surface the floats stabilised the X-114 and, in combination with [...] the strong <b>anhedral</b> held the fuselage well clear of the water. X-114 had a pod type fuselage, projecting forward as far as the floats. [...] Seating, in rows of two, accommodated six or seven under multi-section glazing. [...] The pod extended rearwards to about one quarter root chord, its rearmost part unglazed and forming a streamlined pylon for the separately podded, [...] Lycoming O-360 flat four engine. [...] A drive shaft ran rearwards from the engine within a conical fairing to a shrouded, five bladed pusher configuration propeller mounted near mid-chord.|$|E
