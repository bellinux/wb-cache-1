500|$|Usher and will.i.am {{shot the}} video {{the weekend of}} March 6, 2010. The video was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. In an interview with Rap-Up, Mandler said about {{the concept of the}} video: [...] "...The video is a spectacle. It really emphasizes what we love about Usher and the character and the icon that he is, and most importantly, it’s really a video that showcases his superstardom". The video was released on March 30, 2010, on VEVO and AMTV. According to Mandler, the original idea for the video was citing Max Headroom, a fictional artificial intelligence character from 1980s British television and film. The reference is made when Usher is seen on a flickering television {{at the beginning of the}} video. Mandler specified, commenting, [...] "Max Headroom was always in his room," [...] he continued, [...] "this unidentifiable room, '80s shapes. I used that for inspiration." [...] Usher stated that he wanted to do something theatrical and fun, and that while will.i.am. brought the international sound, he wanted to bring the producer into his world, [...] "working off of each other and playing off of each other as artists, but the cinematography would be artistic and incredible." [...] Mandler described the visuals in the clip as [...] "Hitchcock-ian", as well as simply capturing Usher in his element, as he said he wanted the R singer's talent to take over. He further explained, stating, [...] "The concept was to create a world where we put Usher in a space where he does what I think he does better than anyone else in the world, which is perform at a level and magnitude of a superstar and take us, the viewer, whether audible or visually, on a journey, not a ride. And, in that, I wanted to create an unpredictability, so one set leads to another and another, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> what's gonna happen. Along the way, Usher becomes our guide. We're so focused on him, we don't notice the change. The thing is unfolding little by little, and you can't quite see far enough ahead to know what's gonna come next." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2016, it was {{reported}} that the outgoing executive producer of EastEnders, Dominic Treadwell-Collins, had tried to get Tully to return to the show, saying [...] " [...] emailed back and forth, but she's a director now. I briefly considered a recast, but it just didn't sit right. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know,</b> maybe someone else can woo Sue Tully to come back." [...] He added, [...] "Michelle carries the one unexploded secret—the child. But there are ways around that! So, yes, it was one of my original ideas—bringing Michelle in and the secrets she brings. I love secrets." [...] Instead, Treadwell-Collins introduced Michelle's son with Grant, Mark Fowler, played by Ned Porteous.|$|E
5000|$|The {{subject matter}} of the album was {{inspired}} by Thao Nguyen's relationship with her estranged father, who [...] "left when I was maybe 11 or 12, my parents split up.

2500|$|In a 2007 {{interview}} with CNN, band member Don Henley declared, [...] "This {{is probably the}} last Eagles album that we'll ever make." [...] When questioned {{about the possibility of}} a follow-up album in November 2010, band member Timothy B. Schmit said, [...] "My first reaction would be: no way. But I said that before the last one, so you never really know. Bands are a fragile entity <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> what's going to happen. It took a long time to do that last album, over a span of years, really, and it took a lot out of us. We took a year off at one point. I'm not sure if we're able to do that again. I wouldn't close the door on it, but I don't know." [...] In a 2010 {{interview with}} undercover.fm, Joe Walsh said that the band might be able to make one more album before the band [...] "wraps it up".|$|E
2500|$|Asked in November 2010 {{whether the}} Eagles were {{planning}} {{a follow-up to}} Long Road Out of Eden, Schmit replied, [...] "My first reaction would be: no way.

[...] Frey later stated in a 2012 interview that the band has had discussions about releasing an EP of potentially 4–6 songs that may contain both original and cover material.|$|E
2500|$|Working with Heide Museum for Rings of Saturn, firstly {{we agreed}} on a maquette. Then when I saw the site I knew I had to enlarge the work to do what I call 'conquer the {{landscape}}'. The Australian landscape is an enormously powerful landscape; vast and with clarity of atmosphere, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> in advance how work will look in it. [...] The landscape grips my imagination – I try to measure my work against the vast spaces of this country. Conquering the landscape does not rely on scale but simplicity and clarity of form expressing inner strength and tension. If my sculpture is outdoors or {{in the public domain}} I like it to arouse people's curiosity to explore the work. Multidimensional objects look different from every angle. The exciting thing about outdoor sculpture is the change with the light, the weather... everything is in constant flux. It becomes almost a living entity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said abruptly, [...] "I {{have passed}} my {{word to the}} crowd yonder {{that you are a}} dead-broke miner called Fowler. I allowed that you might have had some row with that Sydney duck, Australian Pete, in the mines. That {{satisfied}} them. If I go back now, and say it's a lie, that your name ain't Fowler, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> who Pete was, they'll jest pass you over to the police to deal with <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> wash their hands of it altogether. You may prove to the police who <b>you</b> are, <b>and</b> how that d--- clerk mistook you, but it will give <b>you</b> trouble. <b>And</b> who is there here who knows who you really are?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Lightning often strikes {{where it}} is least expected," [...] she replied archly. [...] "Listen. If a young woman were unlucky enough to lose her heart to you, she might do {{everything}} but tell <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> would <b>never</b> <b>know</b> it.

25|$|Socrates warns the excitable Hippocrates that Sophists are dangerous. He {{tells him}} that {{the words of the}} Sophists go {{straight}} into the soul (psychē) and can corrupt a person straightaway. Socrates says that buying wisdom from a Sophist is different from buying food and drink at the market. With food <b>and</b> drink, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> what <b>you</b> are getting, but you can consult experts for advice before consuming anything that might be dangerous (313a–314c).|$|R

60|$|But I {{lost the}} thread there, and dozed off to slumber, {{thinking}} about what a pity it was that men with such superb strength --strength enabling them to stand up cased in cruelly burdensome iron and drenched with perspiration, and hack and batter and bang each other for six hours on a stretch--should not have been born {{at a time when}} they could put it to some useful purpose. Take a jackass, for instance: a jackass has that kind of strength, and puts it to a useful purpose, and is valuable to this world because he is a jackass; but a nobleman is not valuable because he is a jackass. It is a mixture that is always ineffectual, and should never have been attempted in the first place. And yet, once you start a mistake, the trouble is done <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> what is going to come of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never say die," [...] was {{his answer}} to Archie's remark.

5000|$|Greil Marcus {{wrote that}} [...] "The deep burr of Morrison's voice buries the words, which cease to matter; {{you might not}} hear them until the tenth time you play the album, or long after that.

60|$|Sparks, as a rule, are {{looked upon}} as a race of useless and disreputable fellows. Their course is usually erratic. They fly upward, downward, forward, and backward--here, there, <b>and</b> everywhere. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> when <b>you</b> have them, or what will be their next flight. They often create {{a good deal of}} alarm, {{sometimes}} much surprise; they seldom do any good, and frequently cause irreparable damage. Only when caught and restrained, or directed, do sparks become harmless and helpful.|$|R
6000|$|There {{are certain}} {{principles}} in quarrelling, however, {{that the true}} quarreller ever bears in mind, and which, duly observed, do much to facilitate encounters. In the first place, cultivate Distrust. Have always before {{you that this is}} a wicked world, full of insidious people, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> what villainous encroachments upon you may be hidden under fair-seeming appearances. That is the flavour of it. At the first suspicion, [...] "stick up for your rights," [...] as the vulgar say. And see that you do it suddenly. Smite promptly, and the surprise and sting of your injustice should provoke an excellent reply. And where there is least ground for suspicion, there, remember, is the most. The right hand of fellowship extended towards you {{is one of the best}} openings you have. [...] "Not such a fool," [...] is the kind of attitude to assume, and [...] "You don't put upon me so easy." [...] Your adversary resents this a little, and, rankling, tries to explain. You find a personal inference in the expostulation.|$|E
60|$|I jes drop {{a line to}} say we git on fust rate. The {{girls is}} clever and fly round right smart. Miss Meg {{is going to make}} a proper good housekeeper. She hes the liking for it, and gits the hang of things surprisin quick. Jo doos beat all for goin ahead, but she don't stop to cal'k'late fust, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> where she's like to bring up. She done out a tub of clothes on Monday, but she starched 'em afore they was wrenched, and blued a pink calico dress till I thought I should a died a laughin. Beth is the best of little creeters, and a sight of help to me, bein so forehanded and dependable. She tries to learn everything, and really goes to market beyond her years, {{likewise}} keeps accounts, with my help, quite wonderful. We have got on very economical so fur. I don't let the girls hev coffee only once a week, accordin to your wish, and keep em on plain wholesome vittles. Amy does well without frettin, wearin her best clothes and eatin sweet stuff. Mr. Laurie is as full of didoes as usual, and turns the house upside down frequent, but he heartens the girls, so I let em hev full swing.

"You {{should not}} let {{out from the}} {{shoulder}} {{in that sort of}} way, Mr. Norris," [...] the pugilist said, shaking his head; [...] "you hit like the kick of a horse, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> what mayn't come of them sort of blows. No, sir; half-armed hitting is the thing for a general row; it hurts just as much, and is just as good for closing up an eye, but it don't do no general damage, so to speak. Now, sir, there's a row over the business. In course I holds my tongue; but they says as four of the party was young uns, and they guessed as they was gents. Now they puts things together, and have found out as I gives lessons to some of you Westminster gents, and they guesses as some of you was with me. Now, as I tells them, what can they do? They was the first to begin it, and we was only standing on self-defence, that's the way I puts it. No magistrate would look at the charge for a minute. It stands to reason that nine men did not attack four or five hundred. They must have been attacking us, that's clear to any one; and if it was me I should not care the snap of a finger about it--that's what I tells the red-haired tailor when he came here with two of his pals this morning. 'We has as much right to our opinions as you have; you attacks us,' says I, 'and we gives you pepper, that's all about it.' 'His beauty's spoilt for life,' says one of his mates. 'He never had no beauty to spoil,' says I, 'by the look of 'im,' so we got to words. 'They was Westminster boys,' says he. 'That's all you knows about it,' says I. 'I will go to their masters,' says he, 'and report the case, and show him my nose,' says he. 'You have got no case to report,' says I, 'and no nose to show.'
