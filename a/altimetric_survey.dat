40|$|Estimation of {{the surface}} {{elevation}} change of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is essential for understanding its response to recent and future climate change. Laser measurements from the NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) created <b>altimetric</b> <b>surveys</b> of GrIS surface elevations over the 2003 - 2009 operational period of the mission. This paper compares four change detection methods using Release 634 ICESat laser altimetry data: repeat tracks (RTs), crossovers (XOs), overlapping footprints (OFPs), and triangulated irregular networks (TINs). All four methods begin with a consistently edited data set and yield estimates of volumetric loss of ice from the GrIS ranging from - 193 to - 269 km³/yr. Using a uniform approach for quantifying uncertainties, we find that volume change rates at the drainage system scale from the four methods can be reconciled within 1 -σ uncertainties in just 5 of 19 drainage systems. Ice-sheet-wide volume change estimates from the four methods cannot be reconciled within 1 -σ uncertainties. Our volume change estimates lie {{within the range of}} previously published estimates, highlighting that the choice of method plays a dominant role in the scatter of volume change estimates. We find that for much of the GrIS, the OFP and TIN methods yield the lowest volume change uncertainties because of their superior spatial distribution of elevation change rate estimates. However, the RT and XO methods offer inherent advantages, and the future work to combine the elevation change detection methods to produce better estimates is warranted...|$|R

This area is located south of the Ceará State, between the meridians 39 ° 30 ' and 40 ° 00 ' W and parallel 7 ° 00 ' and 7030 ' S. To develop the relief partitioning of the Santana do Cariris area was employed the digital elevation model, developed from data obtained by the sensor SIR-C/X-SAR SRTM project, run by NASA in 2000. This mission made the <b>altimetric</b> <b>survey</b> for the Earth's surface by interferometry data, with a spatial resolution of about 90 m, allowed to obtain the morphometric variables of altimetry, slope and landforms. These data are important tools for understanding of geomorphology to undergraduate students of the Geological Mapping. The integrating those products generated from the SRTM images, five main compartments of relief were identified: the plateau, the largest compartment with tops plans or gently undulating, sedimentary plateau and depression. The presence of morphologies with steeper slopes, both {{on the slopes of}} the plateau as peripheral depression, conditioned the drainage and demonstrates the performance of a marked lithological and structural control in the evolution of this landscape.

40|$|We {{provide the}} {{analytical}} formulation for calculating the displacement and stress field forced by internal sources in a stratified, self-gravitating, viscoelastic earth. This model is specialized {{to study the}} rate of vertical motion and shear stress accumulation produced by lithospheric density anomalies. These sources are allowed to vary in the lateral direction. We show that sphericity {{plays a crucial role}} for elongated lithospheric anomalies while self-gravitation produces minor deviations from a gravitating Earth. When the model is applied to the Apennines we get, for lithospheric viscosity ranging between 1022 and 1023 Pa s, the subsidence of the plate underlying the active front of the overthrusting load to be around 0. 5 – 1. 0 mm yr- 1. This is consistent with the amount of sedimentation in the Adriatic foredeep. The deformation pattern is very peculiar, with the largest subsidence localized beneath the active front of the topography. Our model enlightens the impact of discontinuities of tectonic phases on vertical motions in collision zones. If lithospheric viscosity is around 1022 Pa s, vertical motions decay drastically on time scales of 105 yr if lateral migration of density anomalies comes to an end. For higher viscosities, deformation rates are maintained longer. This correlation between horizontal and vertical motions suggests that <b>altimetric</b> geodetic <b>surveying</b> along levelling lines of a few hundred kilometers can be an important tool to constrain the tectonics of the studied region. Results are also shown for vertical motions along a transect perpendicular to the Apennines, when the crustal structure inverted from Bouguer gravity data is considered. Analysis of the stress field induced by an overthrusting load shows that principal stress differences of a few bar (or a few tenths of MPa) can be accumulated on time scales of 102 - 103 yr. These low values agree with the average stress drop of earthquakes in the Appalachians and northern Apennines where our modelling can be applied. We find that lateral density variations certainly contribute to intraplate stresses, but they are less efficient in triggering earthquakes than other mechanisms, such as transcurrent motions along active plate margins. Seismicity induced by lateral variations of crustal and lithospheric density must be moderate, characterized by long return times. These results are in agreement with the recorded seismicity in the northern Apennines where the largest earthquakes have return times of 102 yr. If shear stress is forced by an overthrusting load, we find that the largest rate of stress accumulation in the crust is concentrated beneath the active front, close to the boundary with the ductile lithosphere. Discontinuities of tectonic phases {{play an important role in}} controlling the amount of shear stress due to density anomalies...|$|R
40|$|Many {{airborne}} applications, such as altimetry or photogrammetry without {{ground control}} points, strongly {{rely on the}} precise evaluation of the aircraft’s attitude. This paper presents an approach to the attitude determination problem, where a system combining Litton’s LN- 200 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) with differential GPS (DGPS) is described. The methodology {{is based on the}} integrated processing of raw inertial measurements and GPS data collected from at least two receivers on board the aircraft and one, or possibly more, reference stations. It is well known that GPS and inertial navigation systems have complementary operational characteristics that can be exploited in an integrated system for continuous tracking of the aircraft’s navigational parameters (attitude, velocity and position). The incorporation of DGPS observations of one of the aircraft’s GPS antennas, specifically absolute position and doppler velocity readings, improves the overall system accuracy, including the estimates of roll and pitch angles that result from filtered raw inertial measurements, since it enables the continuous alignment of the strapdown analytical platform. By processing carrier phase measurements in differential mode between a pair of the aircraft’s GPS antennas (without information from any reference station), good attitude observations, especially true heading, are obtained. This is critical to align the low cost inertial platform in heading, since azimuth errors are weakly coupled with velocity or position errors. In fact, by this method alignment is achieved in motion and very quickly. The inertial system also provides high rate (DGPS filtered) position and velocity estimates that can be valuable during GPS signal outages and in DGPS ambiguity fixing procedures that occur whenever a new satellite becomes visible or cycle slips are detected. The estimated accuracy is 0. 01 º (1 s) for roll and pitch and 0. 1 º (1 s) for heading. Should the reference station data be absent and stand-alone doppler and position estimates be used instead, some degradation of the roll and pitch accuracy are to be expected. Besides a description of the relevant theory, this paper also includes post-processing results from {{one of a series of}} flights that took place in the Azorean area during a gravimetric and <b>altimetric</b> <b>survey.</b> The present methodology was successfully employed to process all data from this campaign...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{presentation}} of the techniques used to process inertial and GPS data collected during an airborne gravimetric and <b>altimetric</b> <b>survey</b> in order to obtain absolute position and attitude estimates of the sensors mounted on board the aircraft. For high precision gravimetry and altimetry, these navigational parameters are required, in the order of a decimeter for position and better than one arc-minute for attitude. The survey took place in the Portuguese Azorean area in October 1997. It consisted of flying a series of profiles with a set of instruments mounted in a military aircraft, covering a large area around the islands, mainly over the mid-Atlantic ridge. The instruments whose position and attitude had to be determined were a gravimeter and two altimeters (one laser and another radar). For this purpose, three GPS receivers and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) were used. The basic idea was to have a relatively low cost system that would be able to supply position and attitude with a level of accuracy and reliability similar to other more expensive systems, like gimbaled and ring laser gyro based inertial systems. One other requirement was that it should be able to work in real time. This feature could be useful for repeating flight tracks and for many other applications. For this purpose, a radio link was established with the aircraft to supply GPS data from a ground reference station. The methodology for processing GPS and IMU raw data was implemented with an integrated feedback loop. The position determination is based on real time DGPS with L 1 and L 2 carrier phase ambiguity fixing, using online IMU processed data to validate and increase the positions reliability, especially during GPS outages and when the aircraft is far away from the nearest GPS reference station. For the attitude angles, the IMU raw data is processed using the absolute GPS position measurements for continuous alignment. The baseline between a pair of GPS antennas is also computed (without resorting to a reference station data), using L 1 and L 2 carrier phase and doppler measurements. This baseline is very helpful for the continuous alignment of the strapdown analytical platform in heading, since this angle estimate is weakly coupled to position updates, especially in the absence of high horizontal accelerations. The position and attitude values were obtained from all the measurements using an Extended Kalman filter. Besides the normal navigation states, the filter also includes extra states to account for the inertial sensor errors and the vertical gravity anomaly...|$|E
