In 1951 IFA, a consumer industry electronics show in Berlin allowed SABA to show the first TV receiver to the world. SABA successes enabled the company to manufacture tape recorders.

50|$|The main {{differences}} between the earlier P-10 and the P-12 included a new antenna feed system with lower side lobes, reduced to 4% of the main lobe. The P-12 also offered a greater frequency range and greater frequency agility, being able to retune to four pre-set frequencies automatically as well as <b>automatic</b> frequency <b>fine</b> <b>tuning.</b> Finally Yenisei had greater accuracy with improved detection range (250 km) and better protection against passive and active interference. In addition to frequency agility the P-12 was the first Russian radar system to use the coherent cancellation moving target indicator (MTI) method to eliminate ground clutter.|$|R

We determine the degree of <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> needed in the DiracNMSSM with and without non-universal gaugino masses and compare it with the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> in the GNMSSM. To apply reasonable cuts on the allowed parameter regions we perform a precise calculation of the Higgs mass. In addition, we include the limits from direct SUSY searches and dark matter abundance. We find that both models are comparable in terms of <b>fine</b> <b>tuning,</b> with the minimal <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> in the GNMSSM slightly smaller. ar X i...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{approach}} the problem of insitu camera calibration using an auxiliary mobile color-depth camera. The calibration is based on image lines and the Direct Linear Transformation (DLT). Calibration includes intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, and radial distortion. Traditionally, camera calibration methods based on DLT combine 2 D and 3 D points. Using 2 D image lines allows adding simple image processing methods for fine tuning the calibration data (lines). Experimental comparison of points and lines based calibration shows that the <b>automatic</b> <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> of the lines is beneficial for the calibration process in noisy conditions. Experiments on both synthetic and real setups show that despite the low computational complexity of the DLT, the proposed calibration methodology yields promising accurate results. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} for automated implementation of an arbiter-based physical unclonable function (PUF) on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). We introduce a high resolution programmable delay logic (PDL) that is im-plemented by harnessing the FPGA lookup-table (LUT) internal structure. PDL allows <b>automatic</b> <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> of delays that can mitigate the timing skews caused by asymmetries in interconnect routing and systematic variations. To thwart the arbiter metastability problem, we present and analyze methods for majority voting of responses. A method to classify and group challenges into different robustness sets is introduced that enhances the corresponding responses ’ stability {{in the face of}} operational variations. The trade-off between response stability and response entropy (uniqueness) is investigated through comprehensive measurements. We exploit the correlation between the impact of temperature and power supply on responses and perform less costly power measurements to predict the temperature impact on PUF. The measurements are performed on 12 identical Virtex 5 FPGAs across 9 different accurately controlled operating temperature and voltage supply points. A database of challenge response pairs (CRPs) are collected and made openly available for the research community...|$|E

40|$|In {{standard}} clinical within-subject {{analyses of}} event-related fMRI data, two steps are usually performed separately: detection of brain activity and {{estimation of the}} hemodynamic response. Because these two steps are inherently linked, we adopt the so-called region-based Joint Detection-Estimation (JDE) framework that addresses this joint issue using a multivariate inference for detection and estimation. JDE is built by making use of a regional bilinear generative model of the BOLD response and constraining the parameter estimation by physiological priors using temporal and spatial information in a Markovian modeling. In contrast to previous works that use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to approximate the resulting intractable posterior distribution, we recast the JDE into a missing data framework and derive a Variational Expectation-Maximization (VEM) algorithm for its inference. A variational approximation is used to approximate the Markovian model in the unsupervised spatially adaptive JDE inference, which allows <b>fine</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>tuning</b> of spatial regularisation parameters. It follows a new algorithm that exhibits interesting properties compared to the previously used MCMC-based approach. Experiments on artificial and real data show that VEM-JDE is robust to model mis-specification and provides computational gain while maintaining good performance in terms of activation detection and hemodynamic shape recovery...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} called hybrid particle swarm optimization like algorithm (hybrid PSO) with <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> operators to solve optimisation problems. This method combines {{the merits of the}} parameter-free PSO (pf-PSO) and the extrapolated particle swarm optimization like algorithm (ePSO). In order to accelerate the PSO algorithms to obtain the global optimal solution, three <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> operators, namely mutation, cross-over and root mean square variants are introduced. The effectiveness of the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> elements with various PSO algorithms is tested through three benchmark functions along with a few recently developed state-of-the-art methods and the results are compared with those obtained without the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> elements. From several comparative analyses, it is clearly seen that the performance of all the three PSO algorithms (pf-PSO, ePSO, and hybrid PSO) is considerably improved with various <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> operators and sometimes more competitive than the recently developed PSO algorithms...|$|R
40|$|For {{some types}} of visuo-motor transformations like large visuo-motor {{rotations}} or the complex transformation of a sliding first-order lever, distinct adaptive processes have been hypothesized that produce a rapid, discrete approximation of the transformation and a slow, graded <b>fine</b> <b>tuning,</b> respectively. Here we investigate whether part-task training of only the second of these processes, namely the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning,</b> transfers to the subsequent performance in a condition with the full transformation of the sliding first-order lever. Therefore, we compared performance of three groups with different practice conditions during transfer to the full transformation. While two groups only practiced the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> without the right-left inversion of the lever prior to transfer, a third group practiced the full lever transformation. Our results show a positive, but less than perfect transfer of the isolated practice of the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> on performance with the full transformation. For the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> itself, transfer was not reliably different from being perfect. The observation that the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> can be acquired separately and added to the later adaptation to the left-right inversion of the lever supports the notion that these slow and fast processes progress rather independently. The additional finding that the preceding acquisition of the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> also facilitates the subsequent rapid process {{could be due to}} generalized learning-to-learn or to a more precise assignment of movement errors to the process from which they originate...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn the {{framework}} of the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) we evaluate the electroweak <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> measure that provides a quantitative test of supersymmetry as a solution to the hierarchy problem. Taking account of current experimental constraints we compute the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> at two-loop order and determine the limits on the CMSSM parameter space and the measurements at the LHC most relevant in covering it. Without imposing the LEPII bound on the Higgs mass, it is shown that the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> computed at two-loop has a minimum Δ= 8. 8 corresponding to a Higgs mass mh= 114 ± 2 GeV. Adding the constraint that the SUSY dark matter relic density should be within present bounds we find Δ= 15 corresponding to mh= 114. 7 ± 2 GeV and this rises to Δ= 17. 8 (mh= 115. 9 ± 2 GeV) for SUSY dark matter abundance within 3 σ of the WMAP constraint. We extend the analysis to include the contribution of dark matter <b>fine</b> <b>tuning.</b> In this case the overall <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> and Higgs mass are only marginally larger for the case SUSY dark matter is subdominant and rises to Δ= 28. 7 (mh= 116. 98 ± 2 GeV) for the case of SUSY dark matter saturates the WMAP bound. For a Higgs mass above these values, <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> rises exponentially fast. The CMSSM spectrum that corresponds to minimal <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> is computed and provides a benchmark for future searches. It is characterised by heavy squarks and sleptons and light neutralinos, charginos and gluinos...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on work that investigates the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> in low scale non-minimal supersymmetric models. We present a {{comparative}} and systematic study of the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> in Higgs sectors in three scale-invariant NMSSM models: the first being the standard Z 3 invariant NMSSM; {{the second is the}} NMSSM plus additional matter filling 3 (5 + 5) representations of SU(5) and is called the NMSSM+; while the third model comprises 4 (5 + 5) and is called the NMSSM++. Naively, one would expect the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> in the plus-type models to be smaller than that in the NMSSM since the presence of extra matter relaxes the perturbativity bound on ? at the low scale. This, in turn, allows larger tree-level Higgs mass and smaller loop contribution from the stops. However we find that LHC limits on the masses of sparticles, especially the gluino mass, can play an indirect, but vital, role in controlling the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning.</b> In particular, working in a semi-constrained framework at the GUT scale, we find that the masses of third generation stops are always larger in the plus-type models than in the NMSSM without extra matter. This is an RGE effect which cannot be avoided, and as a consequence the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> in the NMSSM+ (? ~ 200) is significantly larger than in the NMSSM (? ~ 100), with <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> in the NMSSM++ (? ~ 600) being significantly larger than in the NMSSM+. Moreover, supersymmetric unified models in which the Z’ couples to the Higgs doublets, as in the E 6 class of models, have large <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> dominated by the experimental mass limit on the Z’. To illustrate this we investigate the degree of <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> throughout the parameter space of the Constrained Exceptional Supersymmetric Standard Model (cE 6 SSM) that is consistent with a Higgs mass mh ~ 125 GeV. Fixing tan ? = 10, and taking specific values of the mass of the Z’ boson, with MZ’ ~ 2 - 4 TeV. We find that the minimum <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> set predominantly from the mass of Z’ and varies from ~ 200 - 400 as we vary MZ’ from~ 2 - 4 TeV. However, this is lower than the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> in the constrained Minimal Supersymmetic Standard Model (cMSSM) of 0 (1000), arising from the large stop masses required to achieve the Higgs mass. Finally, it was found that varying tan ? below and above 10 does not correspond to lower <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> in the cE 6 SSM, nor does lowering the mass of the Z’ by lowering its associated coupling g’...|$|R

40|$|Low energy {{supersymmetry}} {{is motivated}} by its use {{as a solution to}} the hierarchy problem of the electroweak scale. Having motivated this model with naturalness arguments, it is then necessary to check whether the experimentally allowed parameter space permits realisations of the model with low <b>fine</b> <b>tuning.</b> The scope of this thesis is a study of naturalness of the electroweak physics in the minimal supergravity model. The latest experimental constraints are applied, and the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> is quantitatively evaluated for a scan across the parameter space. The <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> of the electroweak scale is evaluated at 2 -loop order, and the <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> of the neutralino dark matter thermal relic energy density is also determined. The natural regions of the parameter space are identified and the associated phenomenology relevant for detection discussed. Naturalness limits are also found for the parameter space and spectrum. The minimum <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> found is 1 part in 9 when dark matter constraints are neglected, and 1 part in 15 when dark matter constraints are satisfied. For both cases, the minimum <b>fine</b> <b>tuning</b> is found for a Higgs mass of 115 GeV irrespective of whether the Higgs mass constraint is applied or not. The most natural spectrum includes light superpartner fermions, and heavy superpartner scalars. Minimal supergravity currently remains viable with respect to naturalness and a natural realisation may be discovered within the next couple of years. Comment: 148 pages, D. Phil.
