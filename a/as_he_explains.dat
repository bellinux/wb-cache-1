5|$|Unlike the {{official}} account, Bissonnette's version alleges that bin Laden's wife Mariam was uninjured in the raid. In addition, Bissonnette {{states that the}} report of bin Laden's daughter Safia having splintered wood striking her foot is false, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>explains</b> that it was rather his wife Amal who was injured by such fragments.|$|E
5|$|Other {{similarities}} include {{engaging in}} the suspense the speaker is attempting to create. In both scenarios, you must put aside {{the knowledge that the}} performers know the outcome of the event being relayed and, in a sense, play along. This is integral to his stance <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>explains</b> “the argument that much of talk consists of replayings and that these make no sense unless some form of storyteller's suspense can be maintained shows the close relevance of frame-indeed, the close relevance of dramaturgy-for the organization of talk.” Lastly, because the replaying of strips is not extemporaneous, but rather preformulated, it is yet another parallel between a stage production and conversation. All of these things work in concert to provide a foundation of how talk is framed.|$|E

He reveals that his wife had a stroke eight months ago while he was out watching a cricket match, and has been in a coma ever since. The two bond over their similar situations. Later, Girish drops Tara off at a hotel and gives her Rajat's bag. Tara finds his watch in it and puts it on. The next day she is angered after reading an intimate message on Rajat's phone from a colleague Sheetal, who is later revealed to be a man.

25|$|Kovel follows Marx's {{theories}} about the contradiction between use values and exchange values. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>explains</b> in The Enemy of Nature, within a market economy, goods are not produced to meet needs but are produced to be exchanged for money that we then use to acquire other goods. As {{we have to keep}} selling in order to keep buying, we must persuade others to buy our goods just to ensure our survival, which leads to the production of goods with no previous use that can be sold to sustain our ability to buy other goods. Kovel stresses that this contradiction has reached a destructive extent, where certain essential activities – such as caring for relatives full-time and basic subsistence – are unrewarded, while unnecessary economic activities earn certain individuals huge fortunes.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>explains</b> {{in one of}} {{his lectures}} in the Greek village of Leonidio in 1984, many newly founded {{societies}} start from an autonomous state which is usually in the form of direct democracy, like the town hall meetings during the American Revolution and the local assemblies of the Paris Commune. What they end up with, however, is a form of governance by which the citizens do not legislate directly but delegate this power to a group of experts who remain in power, largely unchecked by official means, for a number of years. The ancient Greeks on the other hand developed a system of continuous autonomy where the people (demos) voted constantly on matters of government and law and where the elected rulers, the archons, were mainly asked to enforce them. In such a system, courts of law were governed by common citizens who were appointed to the degree of judge briefly and army generals were voted in by the people and had to convince them of the correctness of their decisions. Taking some poetic licence to expand this point, he says that in this system, {{the president of the national}} treasury could have been a Phoenician slave, since he would only be asked to implement the rulings of the demos.|$|E

500|$|The bikini {{gradually}} grew to gain wide {{acceptance in}} Western society. According to French fashion historian Olivier Saillard, the bikini {{is perhaps the}} most popular type of female beachwear around the globe because of [...] "the power of women, and not the power of fashion". <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>explains,</b> [...] "The emancipation of swimwear has always been linked to the emancipation of women." [...] By the early 2000s, bikinis had become a US$811 million business annually, and boosted spin-off services like bikini waxing and the sun tanning.|$|E
500|$|The writing style {{reflects}} the author's intent {{to use the}} text for a lecture series. The narration addresses the audience while guiding it through explanations of the issues and anecdotal illustrations. Lewis' charismatic, eloquent, and energetic oration style {{is reflected in the}} writing. The tone has been described as loud and persuasive. One reviewer called it [...] "vintage Lewis – incisive criticism leavened with high-blown rhetoric". The book focuses more upon real-world human experiences, rather than numbers and statistics, in discussing the effect of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa and the world's response. Lewis' eyewitness accounts are candid and vivid. For example, he recounts tours of hospitals and schools <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>explains</b> the dire straits of national health and education sectors, and he describes meetings with diplomats and staff from the UN, World Bank, and IMF <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>explains</b> their effect on foreign aid policies. The book is written from an idealistic perspective and, despite the anger and underlying sense of guilt, Lewis remains optimistic. While he was a professional diplomat, his memoir-style reflections on specific people, such as Michel Camdessus, Carol Bellamy, and Thabo Mbeki were called undiplomatic. Despite the book's undiplomatic style, Lewis retained his post as a UN Special Envoy until the term completed in December 2006.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduces}} the recurring {{character of the}} wildling Osha. The writer of the original books, George R. R.

[...] However, when he saw the audition tapes he was convinced with the new approach: [...] "she was sensational, and I said, 'It's gotta be her.|$|E

500|$|Helen Braithwaite, in {{her book}} on Johnson, argues that [...] "by July 1798... the Analytical had become a deep thorn {{in the side of}} the government"; at Johnson's trial for seditious libel, an issue of the {{periodical}} was entered as evidence against him, demonstrating that the government did not view the journal as non-partisan. Derek Roper, in his survey of late-eighteenth-century periodicals, describes the Analytical as [...] "more radical both in politics and in religion than any other journal". <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>explains,</b> however, [...] "these sentiments were not always fully explicit, and might be conveyed through the tone and manner of a summary rather than paragraphs of criticism".|$|E

According to French fashion {{historian}} Olivier Saillard, this was due to [...] "the power of women, and not the power of fashion". <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>explains,</b> [...] "The emancipation of swimwear has always been linked to the emancipation of women", though one survey indicates 85% of all bikinis never touch the water. By 1988 the bikini made up nearly 20% of swimsuit sales, more than any other model in the US, though one-piece suits made a comeback during the 1980s and early 1990s.|$|E

500|$|Pliny's Natural History {{was written}} {{alongside}} other substantial works (which {{have since been}} lost). Pliny (23–79) combined his scholarly activities with a busy career as an imperial administrator for the emperor Vespasian. Much of his writing was done at night; daytime hours were spent working for the emperor, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>explains</b> in the dedicatory preface addressed to Vespasian's elder son, the future emperor Titus, {{with whom he had}} served in the army. As for the nocturnal hours spent writing, these were seen not as a loss of sleep but as an addition to life, for as he states in the preface, Vita vigilia est, [...] "to be alive is to be watchful", in a military metaphor of a sentry keeping watch in the night. Pliny claims to be the only Roman ever to have undertaken such a work, in his prayer for the blessing of the universal mother: ...|$|E
500|$|When A. Koszul first {{published}} an edited version of Midas in 1922, he argued [...] "that the little classical fancies which Mrs. Shelley never ventured to publish are quite as worthy of consideration as her more ambitious prose works". However, his [...] "Introduction" [...] {{to the play}} speaks mostly of Percy Shelley and his contribution to Mary Shelley's works. In fact, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>explains,</b> he has decided to publish {{to contribute to the}} Percy Shelley centenary. Since their original publication, neither Midas nor Prosperine has received much critical attention. Critics have either only paid attention to Percy Shelley's poems or dismissed the plays. Literary critic Elizabeth Nitchie wrote that the plays are [...] "distinguished only by the lyrics that [...] Shelley wrote for them" [...] and Sylva Norman contends that they [...] "do not really call for analytical and comparative study". However, in the last fifteen years or so, beginning with the publication of The Other Mary Shelley, more {{attention has been paid to}} Mary Shelley's [...] "other" [...] works, such as her dramas.|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} of the script of The Orphanage was written by Sergio G. Sánchez in 1996. Sánchez was not sure why he chose to write a genre film for the screenplay, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>explains,</b> [...] "I ended up writing a film {{in the style of}} those I liked as a kid, movies like Poltergeist, The Omen, and Rosemary's Baby which I ruined on the first VCR we owned at home." [...] Sánchez {{revealed}} the literary influences underlying his writing of the script, such as The Turn of the Screw and Peter Pan. Sánchez originally wanted to direct the script but he was repeatedly turned down by various Spanish production companies. While Sánchez was working on the short film 7337 in 2004, he met with director Juan Antonio Bayona and offered him the script to direct. Bayona accepted the opportunity [...] because he felt that a fantasy themed script like that of The Orphanage would allow him freedom as a director, saying the fantasy genre was a great tool for learning as it [...] "allows manipulation of space and time as we wish or the use of certain camera moves with an immediate efficiency".|$|E
