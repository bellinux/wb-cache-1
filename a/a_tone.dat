50|$|Rundi is a tonal language. There are two {{essential}} tones in Rundi : {{high and}} low (or H and L). Since Rundi has phonemic distinction on vowel length, when a long vowel changes from <b>a</b> low <b>tone</b> to <b>a</b> high <b>tone</b> it is marked as <b>a</b> rising <b>tone.</b> When <b>a</b> long vowel changes from <b>a</b> high <b>tone</b> to <b>a</b> low <b>tone,</b> it is marked as <b>a</b> falling <b>tone.</b>|$|R
25|$|There is {{a two-way}} phonemic {{contrast}} after <b>a</b> low <b>tone.</b> Thus, <b>a</b> low <b>tone</b> may {{be followed by}} another low <b>tone</b> or <b>a</b> high <b>tone.</b>|$|R

5|$|Candide is characterised by its sarcastic tone {{as well as}} by its erratic, fantastical and {{fast-moving}} plot. A picaresque novel with a story {{similar to}} that of a more serious coming-of-age narrative (Bildungsroman), it parodies many adventure and romance clichés, the struggles of which are caricatured in <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> that is mordantly matter-of-fact. Still, the events discussed are often based on historical happenings, such as the Seven Years' War and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. As philosophers of Voltaire's day contended with the problem of evil, so too does Candide in this short novel, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers through allegory; most conspicuously, he assaults Leibniz and his optimism.|$|E
5|$|Corea {{explains}} at {{his website}} {{how he was}} motivated to work on music inspired by To the Stars, commenting that he {{was inspired by a}} scene from the book in which Hubbard describes the Captain of the spaceship in the story playing a melody on a piano. He had read the book eight or nine times, and after writing down musical composition based on Hubbard's work the album was created as <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> poem piece. Previous tone poem albums by Corea include The Leprechaun (1975), My Spanish Heart (1976), and The Mad Hatter (1978). The piece is Corea's first attempt at musical interpretation from one of Hubbard's works.|$|E
5|$|Corea was {{influenced}} in particular by {{a scene from}} Hubbard's work {{where one of the}} main characters plays the piano, and he created the album as <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> poem piece. It was the first time members of his group Chick Corea Elektric Band had gotten together since 1991. Scientology-owned Galaxy Press reissued the book {{at the same time as}} the album's release as a form of cross-marketing. Corea later produced another album, The Ultimate Adventure, also inspired by and named after a work by Hubbard.|$|E

5|$|The seventh symphony, the Sinfonia antartica (1952), a {{by-product}} of the composer's score for Scott of the Antarctic, has consistently divided critical opinion on whether it can be properly classed as a symphony. Alain Frogley in Grove argues that though the work can make a deep impression on the listener, it is neither a true symphony in the understood {{sense of the term}} nor <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> poem and is consequently the least successful of the mature symphonies. The work is in five movements, with wordless vocal lines for female chorus and solo soprano in the first and last movements. In addition to large woodwind and percussion sections the score features a prominent part for wind machine.|$|E

5|$|In Five Songs (1956–57) and Musique funèbre (1958) Lutosławski {{introduced}} his {{own brand of}} twelve-tone music, marking his departure from the explicit use of folk music. His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build harmony and melody from specific intervals (in Musique funèbre, augmented fourths and semitones). This system also gave him the means to write dense chords without resorting to tone clusters, and enabled him to build towards these dense chords (which often include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale) at climactic moments. Lutosławski's twelve-note techniques were thus completely different in conception from Arnold Schoenberg's tone-row system, although Musique funèbre does happen {{to be based on}} <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> row. This twelve-note intervallic technique had its genesis in earlier works such as Symphony No. 1, and Paganini Variations.|$|E
5|$|In tone clusters, {{the notes}} are sounded fully and in unison, {{distinguishing}} them from ornamented figures involving acciaccaturas and the like. Their effect {{also tends to}} be different: where ornamentation is used {{to draw attention to}} the harmony or the relationship between harmony and melody, tone clusters are for the most part employed as independent sounds. While, by definition, the notes that form a cluster must sound at the same time, there is no requirement that they must all begin sounding at the same moment. For example, in R. Murray Schafer's choral Epitaph for Moonlight (1968), <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> cluster is constructed by dividing each choir section (soprano/alto/tenor/bass) into four parts. Each of the sixteen parts enters separately, humming a note one semitone lower than the note hummed by the previous part, until all sixteen are contributing to the cluster.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{extensively}} studied cerebellar learning tasks is the eyeblink conditioning paradigm, in which a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) such as <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> or a light is repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US), such as an air puff, that elicits a blink response. After such repeated presentations of the CS and US, the CS will eventually elicit a blink before the US, a conditioned response or CR. Experiments showed that lesions localized either to a specific part of the interposed nucleus (one of the deep cerebellar nuclei) or to a few specific points in the cerebellar cortex would abolish learning of a conditionally timed blink response. If cerebellar outputs are pharmacologically inactivated while leaving the inputs and intracellular circuits intact, learning takes place even while the animal fails to show any response, whereas, if intracerebellar circuits are disrupted, no learning takes place—these facts taken together make a strong case that the learning, indeed, occurs inside the cerebellum.|$|E
50|$|In tuning systems using just intonation, such as 5-limit tuning, {{in which}} major seconds occur in two {{different}} sizes, the wider of them is called <b>a</b> major <b>tone</b> or greater tone, and the narrower <b>a</b> minor <b>tone</b> or, lesser tone. The difference in size between <b>a</b> major <b>tone</b> and <b>a</b> minor <b>tone</b> is equal to one syntonic comma (about 21.51 cents).|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> lexical <b>tone,</b> if it {{does not}} form a plateau with <b>a</b> {{following}} lexical <b>tone,</b> is always followed by <b>a</b> low <b>tone.</b> This low tone can either be in the following syllable, as in ekibúga city or the second half (mora) of a syllable containing <b>a</b> falling <b>tone,</b> as in eddwâlíró hospital or ensî country.|$|R

5|$|The lip {{position}} and pressure, shaping of the vocal tract, choice of reed and mouthpiece, amount of air pressure created, and evenness of the airflow account {{for most of}} the clarinetist's ability to control the tone of a clarinet. A highly skilled clarinetist will provide the ideal lip and air pressure for each frequency (note) being produced. They will have an embouchure which places an even pressure across the reed by carefully controlling their lip muscles. The airflow will also be carefully controlled by using the strong stomach muscles (as opposed to the weaker and erratic chest muscles) and they will use the diaphragm to oppose the stomach muscles to achieve <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> softer than a forte rather than weakening the stomach muscle tension to lower air pressure. Their vocal tract will be shaped to resonate at frequencies associated with the tone being produced.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} of most {{clarinets}} is divided into the upper joint, the holes and most keys of which are operated by the left hand, and the lower joint with holes and most keys operated by the right hand. Some clarinets have a single joint: on some basset horns and larger clarinets the two joints are held together with a screw clamp and are usually not disassembled for storage. The left thumb operates both <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> hole and the register key. On some models of clarinet, such as many Albert system clarinets and increasingly some higher-end Boehm system clarinets, the register key is a 'wraparound' key, with the key {{on the back of}} the clarinet and the pad on the front. Advocates of the wraparound register key say it improves sound, and it is harder for moisture to accumulate in the tube beneath the pad. Nevertheless, there is a consensus among repair techs that this type of register key is harder to keep in adjustment, i.e., it is hard to have enough spring pressure to close the hole securely.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months after}} the single's release, the Smiths {{recorded}} the song again during aborted sessions for their debut album with producer Troy Tate. This version was recorded <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> lower than the original in the key of F# minor, and features a shorter introduction. The Smiths recorded the song again with producer John Porter in October at Manchester's Pluto Studios. Morrissey rejected {{this version of the}} song. Due to impending deadlines, the version that ultimately appeared on the band's first album The Smiths was a remix of the original master recording from the Strawberry Studios session. For this version, Porter increased the separation between Marr's guitar tracks and Morrissey's vocals, emphasised drummer Mike Joyce's drum beat, pushed Rourke's bass back in the mix, and created a more dramatic opening and conclusion to the song.|$|E

5|$|The Sermons of Swift {{have none}} of that thunder which appals, or that resistless and winning {{softness}} which melts, the hearts of an audience. He can never have enjoyed the triumph of uniting hundreds in one ardent sentiment of love, of terror, or of devotion. His reasoning, however powerful, and indeed unanswerable, convinces the understanding, but is never addressed to the heart; and, indeed, from his instructions to a young clergyman, he seems hardly to have considered pathos as a legitimate ingredient in an English sermon. Occasionally, too, Swift's misanthropic habits break out even from the pulpit; nor is he altogether able to suppress his disdain of those fellow mortals, on whose behalf was accomplished the great work of redemption. With such unamiable feelings towards his hearers, the preacher might indeed command their respect, but could never excite their sympathy. It may be feared that his Sermons were less popular from another cause, imputable more to the congregation than to the pastor. Swift spared not the vice of rich or poor; and, disdaining to amuse the imaginations of his audience with discussion of dark points of divinity, or warm them by a flow of sentimental devotion, he rushes at once {{to the point of}} moral depravity, and upbraids them with their favourite and predominant vices in <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> of stern reproof, bordering upon reproach. In short, he tears the bandages from their wounds, like the hasty surgeon of a crowded hospital, and applies the incision knife and caustic with salutary, but rough and untamed severity. But, alas! the mind must be already victorious over the worst of its evil propensities, that can profit by this harsh medicine. There is a principle of opposition in our nature, which mans itself with obstinacy even against avowed truth, when it approaches our feelings in a harsh and insulting manner. And Swift was probably sensible, that his discourses, owing to these various causes, did not produce the powerful effects most grateful to the feelings of the preacher, because they reflect back to him those of the audience.|$|E
