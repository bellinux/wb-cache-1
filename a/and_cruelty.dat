5|$|Andronikos Komnenos {{was a man}} of astounding contrasts. Handsome and eloquent, the new emperor was at {{the same}} time known for his licentious exploits. Energetic, able and determined, Andronikos was a true Komnenos. However, he was also capable of terrifying brutality, {{violence}} <b>and</b> <b>cruelty.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of vandalism, with {{destruction}} of property <b>and</b> <b>cruelty</b> to animals and people. Around 1912, the BSA, Boys Clubs and other neighborhood organizations came together to encourage a safe celebration that would end the destruction that had become so common on this night.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{was also}} noted {{as having a}} strong moral sense and was an early campaigner for fair {{treatment}} of animals. He objected to the docking of horses' tails, the mistreatment of performing animals such as bears, <b>and</b> <b>cruelty</b> to dogs. Above all, he thought war utterly pointless. All these themes recur in his engravings, which echo Hogarth's attention to moral themes. For example, he shows wounded soldiers with wooden legs, back from the wars, and animals with a gallows in the background.|$|E

5000|$|It {{speaks to}} me of G.O. 100, with all its {{attendant}} horrors <b>and</b> <b>cruelties</b> <b>and</b> sufferings; of a country laid waste with fire and sword; of animals useful to man wantonly killed; of men, women and children hunted like wild beasts, {{and all of this}} in the name of Liberty, Humanity, and Civilization.|$|R
5|$|While Tiberius was in Capri, rumours abounded as to {{what exactly}} he was doing there. Suetonius records the rumours of lurid tales of sexual perversity, {{including}} graphic depictions of child molestation, <b>and</b> <b>cruelty,</b> {{and most of all}} his paranoia. While heavily sensationalized, Suetonius' stories at least paint a picture of how Tiberius was perceived by the Roman senatorial class, and what his impact on the Principate was during his 23 years of rule.|$|E
5|$|Later, Violet overhears Caesar and his Mafia {{associates}} {{beating and}} torturing Shelly (Barry Kivel), {{a man who}} has been skimming money from the business. Upset by the violence <b>and</b> <b>cruelty,</b> Violet seeks solace from Corky. She tells Corky that she wants to make a new life for herself, but that she needs her help. Knowing that Caesar will find the nearly $2 million Shelly took and count it in their apartment, the two women hatch a scheme to steal the money. Corky, already wary of Violet's intentions, is unsure whether to trust her.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{standardized}} diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the DSM and ICD, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience <b>and</b> <b>cruelty</b> do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.|$|E

5|$|Some SS {{members were}} subject to summary execution, torture, and beatings {{at the hands of}} freed prisoners, {{displaced}} persons, or Allied soldiers. American soldiers of the 157th Regiment, who entered the concentration camp at Dachau in April 1945 and saw the human deprivation <b>and</b> <b>cruelty</b> committed by the SS, shot some of the remaining SS camp guards. On 15 April 1945, British troops entered Bergen-Belsen. They placed the SS guards on starvation rations, made them work without breaks, forced them to deal with the remaining corpses, and stabbed them with bayonets or struck them with their rifle butts if they slowed their pace. Some members of the US Army Counter Intelligence Corps delivered captured SS camp guards to displaced persons camps, where they knew they would be subject to summary execution.|$|E
5|$|There are {{records of}} two tutors {{for the young}} duke during the late 1030s and early 1040s, but the extent of William's {{literary}} education is unclear. He was not known as a patron of authors, {{and there is little}} evidence that he sponsored scholarship or other intellectual activities. Orderic Vitalis records that William tried to learn to read Old English late in life, but he was unable to devote sufficient time to the effort and quickly gave up. William's main hobby appears to have been hunting. His marriage to Matilda appears to have been quite affectionate, and there are no signs that he was unfaithful to her– unusual in a medieval monarch. Medieval writers criticised William for his greed <b>and</b> <b>cruelty,</b> but his personal piety was universally praised by contemporaries.|$|E

25|$|Churchmen were {{appalled by}} the ruthlessness <b>and</b> <b>cruelty.</b> The Church's support for the Free State aroused bitter hostility among some republicans.

25|$|Swami Sivananda {{also notes}} that God is free from charges of {{partiality}} <b>and</b> <b>cruelty</b> which are brought against him because of social inequality, fate, and universal suffering in the world. According to the Brahma Sutras, individual souls are {{responsible for their own}} fate; God is merely the dispenser and witness with reference to the merit and demerit of souls.|$|E
25|$|Swami Tapasyananda further {{explains}} the Madhva view by illustrating the doctrine with this analogy: {{the power in}} a factory comes from the powerhouse (God), but the various cogs (jivas) move in a direction {{in which they are}} set. Thus he concludes that no charge of partiality <b>and</b> <b>cruelty</b> can be brought against God. The jiva is the actor and also the enjoyer of the fruits of his/her own actions.|$|E
50|$|Butler's Analogy {{was one of}} many book-length replies to the deists, and it {{was long}} widely {{believed}} to be the most effective. Butler argued that nature itself was full of mysteries <b>and</b> <b>cruelties,</b> <b>and</b> thus shared the same alleged defects as the Bible. Arguing on empiricist grounds that all knowledge of nature and human conduct is merely probable, Butler then appealed to a series of patterns ("analogies") observable in nature and human affairs, which, in his judgment, make the chief teachings of Christianity likely true.|$|R
