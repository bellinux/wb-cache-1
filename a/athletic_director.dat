40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the criteria and qualifications National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) <b>athletic</b> <b>directors</b> utilized in their decisions to hire head football coaches. From this study, 13 <b>athletic</b> <b>directors</b> were able to complete a survey entitled "An <b>Athletic</b> <b>Director's</b> Criteria for Hiring Head Football Coaches. " The first research question addressed the main components of an NAIA <b>athletic</b> <b>director's</b> criteria when hiring a head football coach. Integrity and communication were stated as the top two most important characteristics of a head football coach at the NAIA level followed by leadership, organization, and knowledge of football. Research question two addressed whether or not a winning record was an important component of an <b>athletic</b> <b>director's</b> evaluation and of the 13 <b>athletic</b> <b>directors,</b> 12 of them felt that winning was not the most important factor. Research question three addressed whether individuals were likely to be hired as a head coach without prior head coaching experience. Two <b>athletic</b> <b>directors</b> felt that two or less years of coaching experience was necessary while a majority felt that three or more years were necessary.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} risk management practices of high school <b>athletic</b> <b>directors.</b> A 30 -question survey was sent to 463 <b>athletic</b> <b>directors</b> in Minnesota. A total of 116 <b>athletic</b> <b>directors</b> responded electronically to the survey for a 25 % response rate. The study revealed that the majority (56 %) of <b>athletic</b> <b>directors</b> in Minnesota did not have a written risk management plan. Although most <b>athletic</b> <b>directors</b> in Minnesota agreed that a written risk management plan would make conditions safer (92 %), 26. 3 % lacked time to develop and implement a plan, 20. 8 % lacked expertise, and 19. 7 % perceived no need for a plan. In addition, <b>athletic</b> <b>directors</b> lacked knowledge of standards in risk management to develop, implement, and manage a plan. Athletic administrators can use the findings to educate districts and coaches on the importance of developing, implementing, and managing a risk management plan. Further research is needed to determine if similar problems with written risk management plans exist elsewhere in the United States...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to gather {{information}} from college <b>athletic</b> <b>directors</b> from Division I-A and Division III institutions concerning the factors that they deem the most and least important in evaluating their institution's head football coach for job retention. The study identified 10 factors that are instrumental in evaluating head football coaches. <b>Athletic</b> <b>directors</b> prioritized these 10 factors in order of importance when evaluating their head football coach. Surveys were sent to 106 Division I-A <b>athletic</b> <b>directors</b> and 106 Division III <b>athletic</b> <b>directors.</b> Of the 151 surveys returned, 47 from Division I-A <b>athletic</b> <b>directors</b> and 67 from Division III <b>athletic</b> <b>directors</b> were deemed usable. The surveys revealed that Division I-A <b>athletic</b> <b>directors</b> primarily evaluate their head football coaches by win/loss percentage and compliance with NCAA rules. Of the ten factors selected for this study, public relations and organizational skills were considered the least important factors in their evaluation process. For Division III <b>athletic</b> <b>directors,</b> the primary factors of evaluation for their head football coaches were knowledge of the sport, loyalty to the institution, and serving as a role model for student-athletes. The least important factors were win/loss percentage and public relations. These findings suggest that the philosophy of athletics for each of these two levels is quite different. Head football coaches at the Division I-A level are expected to win games to maintain their jobs while Division III coaches do not experience the same pressure to win. Differences in the evaluation factors are illustrated for each level of collegiate athletics and understanding these differences may better guide aspiring young coaches who are pursuing a career in college football coaching.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the hiring practices for head football coaches at the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivison (FBS) “Power 5 ” level. The research assesses the hiring practices used by athletic departments and evaluates various {{components of the}} hiring process that are utilized when hiring a head football coach. Additionally, this study seeks to identify trends and common practices used by <b>Athletic</b> <b>Directors</b> when hiring head football coaches. Participating <b>Athletic</b> <b>Directors</b> completed a survey questionnaire which asked them to share insights regarding their personal experience with hiring head football coaches. The {{results of the study}} revealed that 1) the majority of athletic departments do not have a written framework or guidelines for hiring head football coaches, but many <b>Athletic</b> <b>Directors</b> do follow their own specific process; 2) many <b>Athletic</b> <b>Directors</b> have little education or training on hiring head football coaches, and mostly rely on “on the job training”; 3) search firms bring value to the process when assisting <b>Athletic</b> <b>Directors</b> in their head football coach search; and 4) the majority of <b>Athletic</b> <b>Directors</b> would support a policy similar to the NFL’s Rooney Rule that would mandate at least one minority candidate to be interviewed during the hiring process for a head football coaching vacancy. Evidence from this study could encourage <b>Athletic</b> <b>Directors</b> and university presidents to consider the benefits of a best practices framework or specific process when trying to hire the most qualified and effective head football coach.
