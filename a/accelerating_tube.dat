40|$|The {{origin and}} rapid {{diversification}} of flowering plants has puzzled evolutionary biologists, {{dating back to}} Charles Darwin. Since that time {{a number of key}} life history and morphological traits have been proposed as developmental correlates of the extraordinary diversity and ecological success of angiosperms. Here, I identify several innovations that were fundamental to the evolutionary lability of angiosperm reproduction, and hence to their diversification. In gymnosperms pollen reception must be near the egg largely because sperm swim or are transported by pollen tubes that grow at very slow rates (< ≈ 20 μm/h). In contrast, pollen tube growth rates of taxa in ancient angiosperm lineages (Amborella, Nuphar, and Austrobaileya) range from ≈ 80 to 600 μm/h. Comparative analyses point to <b>accelerated</b> pollen <b>tube</b> growth rate as a critical innovation that preceded the origin of the true closed carpel, long styles, multiseeded ovaries, and, in monocots and eudicots, much faster pollen tube growth rates. Ancient angiosperm pollen tubes all have callosic walls and callose plugs (in contrast, no gymnosperms have these features). The early association of the callose-walled growth pattern with <b>accelerated</b> pollen <b>tube</b> growth rate underlies a striking repeated pattern of faster and longer-distance pollen tube growth often within solid pathways in phylogenetically derived angiosperms. Pollen tube innovations are a key component of the spectacular diversification of carpel (flower and fruit) form and reproductive cycles in flowering plants...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{combustion}} noise of aero-engines has gained in importance. Combustion noise consists of direct noise, {{related to the}} unsteady combustion process itself, and indirect noise. As known, entropy noise, contributing to indirect noise, is produced when entropy fluctuations originating from the combustor are accelerated through the turbine. According to the characterisation of a flow by pressure, entropy and vorticity perturbations, accelerated vorticity fluctuations are likewise expected to generate an indirect noise component. Within this work, the vortex sound generation mechanism was studied in a model experiment simplifying the combustor-turbine combination of aero-engines. Vorticity fluctuations were generated artificially by air-injection into swirl free as well as swirling tube flows and the proof of the emission of vortex sound during their acceleration in a convergent-divergent nozzle could be provided. The spatial and temporal change of the velocity field was determined with Hot-Wire Anemometry measurements upstream of the nozzle and the produced acoustic waves were detected downstream of it. For various flow fields imposed with perturbations the identification and separation of direct and vortex sound was achieved. Beside the dependency on the vorticity fluctuation amplitude, increasing the air-injection into the mean flow augments the vortex sound {{in case of a}} choked nozzle, the swirl intensity of the mean flow was figured out as a further parameter for this indirect sound generation process. In addition to the sound generation caused by the acceleration of a predominant, artificially produced vortex structure, the broadband noise emission of an <b>accelerated</b> <b>tube</b> flow was studied. With a linear theory approach, the alterations of the fluctuating velocity components through the acceleration were estimated. The coupled influence of the flow field upstream of the nozzle and of its occurring changes due to the imposed mean flow gradient revealed a significant effect on the vortex sound and therewith on the indirect noise generation mechanism...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} problem-solving procedures to troubleshoot electrostatic accelerators. A novel technique to diagnose issues with high-voltage components is described. The main application of this technique is noninvasive testing of electrostatic accelerator high-voltage grading systems, measuring insulation resistance, or determining the volume and surface resistivity of insulation materials used in column posts and acceleration tubes. In addition, this technique allows verification of {{the continuity of the}} resistive divider assembly as a complete circuit, revealing if an electrical path exists between equipotential rings, resistors, tube electrodes, and column post-to-tube conductors. It is capable of identifying and locating a “microbreak” in a resistor and the experimental validation of the transfer function of the high impedance energy control element. A simple and practical fault-finding procedure has been developed based on fundamental principles. The experimental distributions of relative resistance deviations (ΔR/R) for both <b>accelerating</b> <b>tubes</b> and posts were collected during five scheduled accelerator maintenance tank openings during 2013 and 2014. Components with measured ΔR/R>± 2. 5 % were considered faulty and put through a detailed examination, with faults categorized. In total, thirty four unique fault categories were identified and most would not be identifiable without the new technique described. The most common failure mode was permanent and irreversible insulator current leakage that developed after being exposed to the ambient environment. As a result of efficient in situ troubleshooting and fault-elimination techniques, the maximum values of |ΔR/R| are kept below 2. 5 % at the conclusion of maintenance procedures. The acceptance margin could be narrowed even further by a factor of 2. 5 by increasing the test voltage from 40  V up to 100  V. Based on experience over the last two years, resistor and insulator failures are less common now due to the routine use of the noninvasive ultrahigh impedance technique...|$|R
