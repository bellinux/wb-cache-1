The gravestones, cemeteries and buildings of the Commission <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>exception.</b> The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the work of young people, noting the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays. Metal theft is also a problem: determined thieves target the bronze swords from the Cross of Sacrifice, which are now replaced with replicas made of fibreglass.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} mammals, {{primates}} {{in general are}} very vocal, and lemurs <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>exception.</b> Some lemur species have extensive vocal repertoires, including the ring-tailed lemur and ruffed lemurs. Some {{of the most common}} calls among lemurs are predator alarm calls. Lemurs not only respond to alarm calls of their own species, but also alarm calls of other species and those of non-predatory birds. The ring-tailed lemur and a few other species have different calls and reactions to specific types of predators. With mating calls, {{it has been shown that}} mouse lemurs that cannot be discerned visually respond more strongly to the calls of their own species, particularly when exposed to the calls of other mouse lemurs that they would encounter normally within their home range. Lemur calls can also be very loud and carry long distances. Ruffed lemurs use several loud calls that can be heard up to 1km (0.62mi) away on a clear, calm day. The loudest lemur is the indri, whose calls can be heard up to 2km (1.2mi) or more and thus communicate more effectively the territorial boundaries over its 34 to 40hectares (0.13 to 0.15sq mi) home range. Both ruffed lemurs and the indri exhibit contagious calling, where one individual or group starts a loud call and others within the area join in. The song of the indri can last 45seconds to more than 3minutes and tends to coordinate to form a stable duet comparable to that of gibbons.|$|E

It temporarily increases the emission of greenhouse gases from reservoirs and contributes to shoreline erosion.|$|E
25|$|Stevens (1982) {{suggests}} that ethology and analytical psychology are both disciplines trying to comprehend universal phenomena.

Following Bowlby, Stevens points out that genetically programmed behaviour {{is taking place in}} the psychological relationship between mother and newborn. The baby's helplessness, its immense repertoire of sign stimuli and approach behaviour, triggers a maternal response. And the smell, sound and shape of mother triggers, for instance, a feeding response.|$|E
25|$|A {{recurring}} theme in contemporary martial arts books is to group characters into different schools and sects and to portrait heroics {{of the main}} characters {{in the context of}} historical rivalries between and schools of martial arts. Cha's novels <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>exception</b> to this. Many of the schools of martial arts portrayed by Cha's works, such as the Shaolin Monastery and the Quanzhen School, do exist in real life, though their details are inevitably subject to the artistic license of Cha; other cults, such as the Beggars' Sect, are less well documented. It should be noted that Cha's portrayal of the schools and sects are mostly in line with their contemporary image in martial arts literature, and new sects such as the Ming Cult are the exception, used specifically as a fictional lead into the next era after the Yuan dynasty into the Ming dynasty.|$|E

6000|$|SECTION XII. One more {{circumstance}} {{remains to}} be noted respecting the Venetian government, the singular unity of the families composing it,--unity far from sincere or perfect, but still admirable when contrasted with the fiery feuds, the almost daily revolutions, the restless successions of families and parties in power, which fill the annals of the other states of Italy. That rivalship should sometimes be ended by the dagger, or enmity conducted to its ends under the mask of law, could not but be anticipated where the fierce Italian spirit was subjected to so severe a restraint: it is much that jealousy appears usually unmingled with illegitimate ambition, and that, for every instance in which private passion sought its gratification through public danger, there are a thousand {{in which it was}} sacrificed to the public advantage. Venice may well call upon us to note with reverence, that of all the towers which are still seen rising like a branchless forest from her islands, there is but one whose office was other than that of summoning to prayer, and that one was a watch-tower only [Footnote: Thus literally was fulfilled the promise to St. Mark,--Pax e.] from first to last, while the palaces of the other cities of Italy were lifted into sullen fortitudes of rampart, and fringed with forked battlements for the javelin and the bow, the sands of Venice never sank under the weight of a war tower, and her roof terraces were wreathed with Arabian imagery, of golden globes suspended on the leaves of lilies.
