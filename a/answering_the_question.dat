5|$|Sweeping through Libreville unopposed, {{the troops}} easily {{captured}} the provincial council, though they met resistance at the Baraka {{military base in}} Lambaréné when they attacked at daylight. Upon learning of the impending attack, Aubame called Cousseran and asked him what had been going on. Cousseran dodged <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> and requested that Aubame release M'ba uninjured. After receiving the false assurance from the ambassador that the French government {{had no intention of}} restoring M'ba to power, Aubame sent out a military officer to the countryside to find the deposed president. M'ba was moved to a small village near the Albert Schweitzer Hospital. At dawn on 19 February, French Air Force planes strafed the rebels at Baraka, while the French Army attacked the insurgents with machine gun fire and mortars. The rebels at the military base promptly surrendered once their ammunition supply ran out, and their commander, Lieutenant Ndo Edou, was executed. Later, the French army managed to break through the gate to the village where M'ba was held and rescued the deposed president.|$|E

50|$|Contestants {{are given}} a {{question}} with three possible <b>answers.</b> <b>The</b> mob has to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> within six seconds, and then the contestant has to <b>answer</b> it. When <b>the</b> contestant is happy to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> he/she then pushes the button that corresponds with <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> If he/she <b>answers</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> correctly, any player in the 100-person mob who <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> incorrectly is eliminated from play. Players add a specific amount to their bank for {{every member of the}} mob they eliminated on a particular question (see table, left). If after any correct <b>answer</b> and <b>the</b> entire 100-person mob eliminated, the contestant wins the grand prize of $1,000,000.|$|R

The player picks a child to come and stand on the podium beside them and they <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> at <b>the</b> same time as the adult.

They set out recommendations for the better dissemination of both understanding of attachment theory and knowledge of the more recent evidence-based treatment options available.|$|E

Matthew's and Mark's accounts end at this point, but John mentions that the next day some people {{from the other side}} of the sea that looked for Jesus, noted that the disciples left without him, but they didn't know where he went. When they came to Capernaum and asked Jesus how he came there, instead of <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> he told the crowd that they followed him, not because they had seen signs, but because of the free loaves they had eaten the day before, and he advised them not to seek earthly gains, but aim for a life based on higher spiritual values.|$|E
25|$|Statistics New Zealand gathers {{information}} on religious affiliation in the five-yearly census. Completing a census form is compulsory by law {{for every person}} in New Zealand on census night but respondents are able to object to <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of religious affiliation, and around 6% do object. The trend shows an increasing proportion of residents in New Zealand declaring no religious affiliation. In the 1991 census, 20.2% were in this category. The proportion {{more than doubled in}} two decades, reaching 41.9% in the 2013 census. Younger people were more likely to indicate they had no religion; except in the 10-14 age bracket, the majority of people under 35 at the 2013 Census stated they had no religion. More males than females stated they had no religion, particularly among people aged 65 years or over.|$|E

25|$|Reflecting on {{previous}} mtDNA studies {{carried out by}} Behar, Atzmon et al. conclude that all major Jewish population groups are showing evidence for founder females of Middle Eastern origin with coalescence times >2000 years. A 2013 study, based on a much larger sample base, drew differing conclusions, namely, that the Mt-DNA of Ashkenazi Jews originated among southern European women, where Diaspora communities had been established centuries before {{the fall of the}} Second Temple in 70 CE. A 2014 study by Fernandez et al. found that Ashkenazi Jews display a frequency of haplogroup K which suggests an ancient Near Eastern origin, stating that this observation clearly contradicts {{the results of the study}} led by Richards which suggested a predominantly European origin for the Ashkenazi community's maternal lines. However, the authors of the 2014 study also state that definitively <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of whether this group was of Jewish origin rather than the result of a Neolithic migration to Europe would require the genotyping of the complete mtDNA in ancient Near Eastern populations.|$|E

In 1975, however, Bannon was asked to include four of her books in Arno Press's library edition of Homosexuality: Lesbians and Gay Men in Society, History and Literature. Then, in 1983, Barbara Grier of the lesbian publishing company Naiad Press actively tracked Bannon down and reissued the books in new covers.

He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's Animal Farm. Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: [...] "If you didn't care what happened to me. And I didn't care for you", then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each.

500|$|The first four, sixth, seventh, {{and eighth}} films were scripted by Steve Kloves; Rowling {{assisted}} {{him in the}} writing process, ensuring that his scripts did not contradict future books in the series. She told Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) certain secrets about their characters before they were revealed in the books. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) asked her if Harry died {{at any point in}} the series; Rowling answered him by saying, [...] "You have a death scene", thereby not explicitly <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> Director Steven Spielberg was approached to direct the first film, but dropped out. The press has repeatedly claimed that Rowling played a role in his departure, but Rowling stated that she had no say in who directed the films and would not have vetoed Spielberg. Rowling's first choice for the director had been Monty Python member Terry Gilliam, but Warner Bros. wanted a family-friendly film and chose Columbus.|$|E
