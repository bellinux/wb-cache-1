40|$|The loss {{mechanisms}} {{associated with}} magnetic bearings {{have yet to}} be adequately characterized or modeled analytically and thus pose a problem for the designer of magnetic bearings. This problem is particularly important for aerospace applications where low power consumption of components is critical. Also, losses are expected to be large for high speed operation. The iron losses in magnetic bearings can be divided into eddy current losses and hysteresis losses. While theoretical models for these losses exist for transformer and electric motor applications, they have not been verified for magnetic bearings. This paper presents the results from a low speed experimental test rig and compares them to calculated values from existing theory. Experimental data was taken over a range of 90 to 2, 800 rpm for several bias currents and two different pole configurations. With certain <b>assumptions</b> <b>agreement</b> between measured and calculated power losses was within 16 percent for a number of test configurations...|$|R

40|$|Radiative heating is {{identified}} as {{a major contributor to}} afterbody heating for Earth entry capsules at velocities above 10 km/s. Because of rate-limited electron-ion recombination processes, a large fraction of the electronically-excited N and O atoms produced in the high temperature/pressure forebody remain as they expand into the afterbody region, which results in significant afterbody radiation. Large radiative heating sensitivities to electron-impact ionization rates and escape factors are identified. Ablation products from a forebody ablator are shown to increase the afterbody radiation by as much as 40 %. The tangent-slab radiation transport approach is shown to over-predict the radiative flux by as much as 40 % in the afterbody, therefore making the more computationally expensive ray-tracing approach necessary for accurate radiative flux predictions. For the Stardust entry, the afterbody radiation is predicted to be nearly twice as large as the convective heating during the peak heating phase of the trajectory. Comparisons between simulations and the Stardust Echelle observation measurements, which are shown to be dominated by afterbody emission, indicate agreement within 20 % for various N and O lines. Similarly, calorimeter measurements from the Fire II experiment are identified as a source of validation data for afterbody radiation. For the afterbody calorimeter measurement closest to the forebody, which experiences the largest afterbody radiative heating component, the convective heating alone is shown to under-predict the measurement, even for the fullycatalytic <b>assumption.</b> <b>Agreement</b> with the measurements is improved with the addition of afterbody radiation. These comparisons with Stardust and Fire II measurements provide validation that the significant afterbody radiation values proposed in this work are legitimate...|$|E

40|$|A {{grazing angle}} {{objective}} on an infrared microspectrometer is studied for quantitative spectroscopy {{by considering the}} angular dependence of the incident intensity within the objective's angular aperture. The assumption {{that there is no}} angular dependence is tested by comparing the experimental reflectance of Si and KBr surfaces with the reflectance calculated by integrating the Fresnel reflection coefficient over the angular aperture under this <b>assumption.</b> Good <b>agreement</b> was found, indicating that the specular reflectance of surfaces can straight-forwardly be quantitatively integrated over the angular aperture without considering non-uniform incident intensity. This quantitative approach is applied to the thickness determination of dipcoated Krytox on gold.

The thickness obtained is in fair agreement with the value determined by ellipsometry in the visible. Therefore, this paper illustrates a method for more quantitative use of a grazing angle objective for infrared reflectance microspectroscopy...|$|R

We estimate the formation rates for different companion masses and different assumptions about the commonenvelope structure and other model parameters. We find that black-hole binaries with intermediate- and high-mass secondaries can form for a wide range of assumptions, while black-hole binaries with low-mass secondaries can only form with apparently unrealistic <b>assumptions</b> (in <b>agreement</b> with previous studies).

40|$|This thesis conducts three {{different}} empirical studies and finds {{that some of}} the pre- 2007 risk assessment model could underestimate the systemic risk of the banking sector and justifies an overhaul. First, it simulates the contagion impact of the UK interbank market. Subject to a number of <b>assumptions</b> (netting <b>agreement,</b> seniority, etc), it finds that the contagion is much severer if the simulation uses consolidated data than using unconsolidated data. Second, the thesis tests whether the riskiness of banks can be mitigated by peer interbank monitoring. Applying to UK market, the thesis finds little evidence of market discipline. The results are attributed to the lenders’ assumption of “too-big-to-fail” and the shortness of loan maturity. Last, the thesis investigates whether banking sector difficulties are preceded by macroeconomic distress. In contrast to most existing studies, the thesis finds that economy still thrives in the “pre-crisis” in terms of increasing GDP growth and the recession is generally associated with the “post-crisis” period. The inconsistency of results is very likely due to imprecise crisis identification of earlier studies which identify crises too late on the basis of “event studies”...|$|R

At the heart of the disagreement are competing conceptions of research and scholarship, perhaps epistemology itself. How are we to study violence and to assess whether it has been increasing or decreasing? What analytic tools do we bring to the table? Pinker, sensibly enough chooses to look at the best available evidence regarding the rate of violent death over time, in pre-state societies, in medieval Europe, in the modern era, and always in a global context; he writes about inter-state conflicts, the two world wars, intrastate conflicts, civil wars, and homicides. In doing so, he takes a critical barometer of violence to be the rate of homicide deaths per 100,000 citizens... Pinker's is a remarkable book, extolling science as a mechanism for understanding issues that are all too often shrouded in unstated moralities, and highly questionable empirical <b>assumptions.</b> Whatever <b>agreements</b> or disagreements may spring from his specifics, the author deserves our respect, gratitude, and applause." ...|$|R

The flow assurance in the deepwater pipelines is very important due to the precipitation of the solid phase of wax on the pipe wall creating blockages and reduces or stops production. There are several mitigation methods were used in the different oil fields around the world to reduce wax deposition such as inhibitors and thermal insulation. This work describes the underlining wax models implemented in OLGA, depending on the experimental data of this study. OLGA software was used to simulate the wax deposition process to predict the behaviour of the wax deposition. A comparison between the experimental wax thickness and the predicted wax thickness was presented. Since simulations based on the default wax parameters did not achieve a complete match with experiments, it was important to find out to what extent tuning of wax parameters was necessary. Three scenarios were created to match the experimental wax thickness, including studying the effect of changing wax porosity in OLGA, changing the crude oil components and the influence of simulation time on wax deposition. The findings of the numerical simulation, after tuning the analogical properties (<b>assumptions),</b> show <b>agreement</b> with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The "Harsanyi Doctrine" {{asserts that}} {{differences}} in individuals' beliefs are to be attributed entirely to differences in information. In its embodiment as a Common Prior assumption it {{is central to the}} economics of information and the foundations of game theory. This paper attempts to provide a framework for the Harsanyi Doctrine (in an incomplete information framework) based on two qualitative properties of individuals' belief hierarchies: Fundamental Agreement and Shared Worlds. A general notion of "agreeing to disagree" about "belief indices" satisfying a Bayesian Sure-Thing Principle is introduced and illustrated by a range of examples and subsequently characterized as equivalent to a local version of the Common Prior <b>assumption.</b> Fundamental <b>Agreement</b> is defined as the absence of any such (implicit) agreement to disagree. The non-trivial gap between this and Harsanyi Consistency proper is bridged by a novel Shared Worlds condition, which requires individuals' beliefs about what is commonly believed to be equal. Common belief in the conjunction of Fundamental Agreement and Shared Worlds is then shown to be equivalent to Harsanyi Consistency. On the technical level, this paper is probably the first to (have to) seriously confront the failure of the common belief operator to satisfy the axiom of "Negative Introspection. "...|$|R
