5|$|Adam Gopnik was {{selected}} to deliver the 2011 Massey Lectures, the annual week-long series of lectures on a political, cultural or philosophical topic given in Canada by a noted scholar. Gopnik was chosen by the panel of representatives from Massey College, House of Anansi Press and the CBC, the organizations responsible for coordinating the lectures. This would be the 50th anniversary of the Massey Lectures and coincide with the 75th anniversary of the CBC. Ideas executive producer Bernie Lucht contacted Gopnik by email to inform him of the panel's decision and {{to ask if he}} would accept.

25|$|Wanda Rogers, who had {{suffered}} {{from a number of}} personal problems for some time, became unreliable and difficult to work with. Concert scheduling was difficult as she sometimes failed to turn up for performances. In 1970, Rogers recorded songs for a solo album, produced by Smokey Robinson and including covers of earlier Motown recordings, which Motown decided to market as The Return of The Marvelettes. As this album featured no other Marvelettes, original member Katherine Anderson refused to participate in appearing {{on the cover of the}} album due to what she felt was Motown's disrespect towards her and the group. The album was only a modest hit, reaching #50 on the R album charts and featured no charted hit singles. Following this, the group disbanded with Katherine Anderson settling briefly as <b>a</b> <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> Motown. After Motown moved to Los Angeles in 1972, Anderson and Rogers left the business altogether returning to Michigan with Anderson settling in her hometown of Inkster while Rogers moved to Southfield, Michigan. Meanwhile, Gladys Horton had moved to Los Angeles where she raised her three sons.|$|E

500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{claimed to}} have been {{inspired}} to write the episode based on three incidents; his dog having worms, his readings about Chernobyl, and the extinction of species during the 1990s.

500|$|... "Not Like the Movies" [...] {{garnered}} critical acclaim. Chris Ryan of MTV {{said the}} song is [...] "rather lovely", but noted that its lyrics refer [...] "very little" [...] to Perry's then-husband, Russell Brand. Elysa Gardner of USA Today called [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] an [...] "irresistible power ballad" [...] and recommended readers to purchase the song. <b>A</b> <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> Portrait Magazine stated that [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] was {{a great way to}} end Teenage Dream and that it showcases the singer's voice quite well, as she has [...] "lyrics to work for instead of ones to just play around with."

500|$|Both Margaret Salinger and Maynard {{characterized}} the author as a devoted film buff. According to Margaret, his favorite movies include Gigi (1958), The Lady Vanishes (1938), The 39 Steps (1935; Phoebe's favorite movie in The Catcher in the Rye), and the comedies of W.C. Fields, Laurel and Hardy, and the Marx Bros.. Predating VCRs, Salinger had an extensive collection of classic movies from the 1940s in 16mm prints. Maynard wrote that [...] "he loves movies, not films", and Salinger argued that her father's [...] "worldview is, essentially, {{a product of}} the movies of his day. To my father, all Spanish speakers are Puerto Rican washerwomen, or the toothless, grinning-gypsy types in a Marx Brothers movie". Lillian Ross, <b>a</b> <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> The New Yorker and longtime friend of Salinger's, wrote following his death, [...] "Salinger loved movies, and he was more fun than anyone to discuss them with. He enjoyed watching actors work, and he enjoyed knowing them. (He loved Anne Bancroft, hated Audrey Hepburn, and said that he had seen Grand Illusion ten times.)" ...|$|E

500|$|Rogen had {{roles in}} Donnie Darko (2001) and [...] (2004). Abig career point {{for him was}} {{becoming}} <b>a</b> <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> Sacha Baron Cohen's last season of DaAli G Show in 2004. Along with the show's other writers, Rogen received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. He became familiar to audiences {{as one of the}} main character's co-workers in Apatow's well-reviewed buddy comedy directorial debut feature The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005). Rogen also co-produced it and improvised all his dialogue. [...] " [...] hadn't done any screen work that indicated he could carry as memorable and convincing a performance as he does with the character Cal," [...] MTV's John Constantine wrote. The Boston Globe reviewer Wesley Morris wrote that Rogen, along with co-stars Rudd and Romany Malco, were each hilarious in their own right and Orlando Sentinel Roger Moore believed that Rogen had his moments in the film whereas Moira Macdonald of the Seattle Times said the actor was [...] "droopily deadpan." [...] He followed this with a small role in You, Me and Dupree (2006), a critically panned comedy featuring Matt Dillon, Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson.|$|E
500|$|The writers later {{noted that}} the episode divided fans. Essentially, those who loved it were those who {{realized}} that the writing was intentionally bad {{as a way of}} parodying bad television writing, while others who did not understand this distinction were less enthusiastic. Matt Groening feared that the fans would interpret the episode in a negative light and was uneasy about the episode when it was in production. He later {{went on to say that}} the episode [...] "turned out great". The writers of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood called it, [...] "A very clever spin on the alternates offered by the Treehouse of Horrors run. Each of the spin-offs is very clever in its own way." [...] It has also appeared as one of the favorite episodes on a number of [...] "best of" [...] lists. Entertainment Weekly placed the episode 19th in their top 25 Simpsons episode list. In an interview for Star-News, The Simpsons writer Don Payne revealed that the episode was in his personal top six of the best The Simpsons episodes. Additionally, Gary Mullinax, <b>a</b> <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> The News Journal, picked the episode as part of his top-ten list.|$|E
500|$|After Fox {{picked up}} the show, it {{acquired}} the working title Chasing Zebras, Circling the Drain ("zebra" [...] is medical slang for an unusual or obscure diagnosis, while [...] "circling the drain" [...] refers to terminal cases, patients in an irreversible decline). The original premise of the show was {{of a team of}} doctors working together trying to [...] "diagnose the undiagnosable". Shore felt it was important to have an interesting central character, one who could examine patients' personal characteristics and diagnose their ailments by figuring out their secrets and lies. As Shore {{and the rest of the}} creative team explored the character's possibilities, the program concept became less of procedure and more focused upon the lead role. The character was named [...] "House", which was adopted as the show's title, as well. Shore developed the characters further and wrote the script for the pilot episode. Bryan Singer, who directed the pilot episode and had a major role in casting the primary roles, has said that the [...] "title of the pilot was 'Everybody Lies', and that's the premise of the show". Shore has said that the central storylines of several early episodes were based on the work of Berton Roueché, <b>a</b> <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> The New Yorker between 1944 and 1994, who specialized in features about unusual medical cases.|$|E

500|$|Thom Jurek, <b>a</b> <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> AllMusic, {{gave the}} album {{a rating of}} three out of five stars. Jurek gave notice to the album's sound quality, telling readers {{that it does not}} [...] "capture the sheer overblown {{intensity}} of the unit in a concert setting," [...] but that it comes closer than one may imagine. Jurek also gave note to how Rick Rubin made the two-discs sound like it were recorded at one gig, writing [...] "Producer Rick Rubin stays out of the way; his production seems to be in terms of shaping the live sound to make it sound like this is all one gig." [...] Entertainment Weeklys David Browne said that it was an [...] "accurate aural snapshots of what it's like {{to be part of a}} crowd craning to see the action on a stage that seems two miles away." [...] Browne also said that [...] "they're perfect examples of the sad current state of the once-proud live rock album." [...] Robert Christgau gave the album a star ("Honorable Mention is a worthy effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like."), saying, [...] "praise the Lord--I can hardly understand a word they're singing (Hell Awaits)." [...] Joel McIver, author of The Bloody Reign of Slayer said that it was regarded as one of the best live albums released by a heavy metal band.|$|E
500|$|The Flukeman—also known affectionately as [...] "Flukey" [...] by {{the cast}} and crew—was portrayed by Darin Morgan, brother of {{executive}} producer Glen Morgan. He would become <b>a</b> <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> the show later in the second season. The Flukeman suit used by Morgan, which included flipper-like feet, yellow contact lenses, and fake teeth, took six hours to put on; this process was eventually sped up. Morgan wore the suit as much as 20 consecutive hours during shooting. As a result, {{he was forced to}} go to the bathroom while still wearing the suit. Morgan was rarely on set without being in full costume, and recalled that when he met up with David Duchovny again upon joining the series' writing staff, the actor had no idea who he was, despite having enjoyed an amiable relationship with the costumed Morgan previously. The suit dissolved in water, forcing special effects artist Toby Lindala to reconstruct the suit each day. Because the suit did not permit Morgan to breathe through his nose, he was unable to eat while wearing it. Carter described the character as [...] "the embodiment of everyone's sense of vulnerability, the idea of something that exists in the underworld of the sewer system and might in fact come to bite you in the least elegant of places". The original intention was showing even less of the Flukeman, but some angles and lighting ended up revealing more of the creature's design. Carter still felt it helped to [...] "get more creepy", as the Flukeman is not shown fully until the final scenes.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to Necrid varied. University of Delaware professor Rachel Hutchinson cited {{him as an}} example of the cultural stereotype of human versus monster, a [...] "mutated or damned [...] deviant from the human norm" [...] that the game's human characters are expected to vanquish. <b>A</b> <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> GameNOW magazine called the visual design [...] "silly" [...] and compared the character to an [...] "old-school He-Man character", but added that Necrid's gameplay was decent. Another magazine, GMR, described him {{as an example of}} [...] "bad American comic book design". IGN's Kaiser Hwang called Necrid a [...] "disappointment" [...] and questioned the character's design in comparison to others in the series; he also felt Necrid was [...] "filler" [...] rather than a complete character. GameSpot made similar comments in their review of the game, as did GameSpy. IGN's Xbox article editor described the character's inclusion as an unnecessary marketing ploy and would have preferred new characters made without McFarlane's involvement; the editor also wrote that Necrid did not [...] "vibe" [...] with the rest of the game. 1UP.com's podcast Retronauts criticized the design and wrote that the character's name was used as a synonym for [...] "shitty". They further added that McFarlane had [...] "tainted" [...] the game with Necrid's inclusion, with host Jeremy Parish stating [...] "I could close my eyes and draw a better character". In a retrospective of the series, Joystiq used him {{as an example of the}} series succumbing to [...] "commercial gimmicks", citing his design as reviled and that Necrid was either too strong or too weak a character to play as, depending on who one asked.|$|E
