Highly expressed genes identified in the <b>amplicons</b> will contribute to the characterization of breast cancer phenotypes, thereby providing novel targets for anticancer therapies...|$|R
50|$|Dosage {{quotient}} {{analysis is}} the usual method of interpreting MLPA data. If a and b are the signals from two <b>amplicons</b> in the patient sample, and A and B are the corresponding <b>amplicons</b> in the experimental control, then the dosage quotient DQ = (a/b) / (A/B).

25|$|Because duplex {{sequencing}} {{provide a}} significantly higher sequencing accuracy and uses information in both strands of DNA, this method needs a much higher sequencing depth and therefore is a costly approach.

If there is a mis-match, it is recorded and the percentage of DNA for which the mis-match is present is noted. This gives the user a percentage methylation per CpG island.|$|E
25|$|Multiplex-PCR: {{consists}} of multiple primer sets {{within a single}} PCR mixture to produce amplicons of varying sizes that are specific to different DNA sequences. By targeting multiple genes at once, additional information may be gained from a single test-run that otherwise would require several times the reagents and more time to perform. Annealing temperatures {{for each of the}} primer sets must be optimized to work correctly within a single reaction, and <b>amplicon</b> sizes.

We used a cultivation-independent method based on the labyrinthulomycete-specific primer LABY-Y to PCR amplify, clone, and sequence 68 nearly full-length 18 S rDNA <b>amplicons</b> from 4 sediment and 3 seawater samples collected in estuarine habitats around Long Island, New York, USA. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all 68 <b>amplicons</b> belonged to the Labyrinthulea. Only 15 of the 68 <b>amplicons</b> belonged to the thraustochytrid phylogenetic group (Thraustochytriidae). None of these 15 were similar to cultivated strains, and 11 formed a novel group. The remaining 53 <b>amplicons</b> belonged either to the labyrinthulid phylogenetic group (Labyrinthulidae) or to other families of Labyrinthulea. that have not yet been described. Of these <b>amplicons,</b> 37 were closely related to previously cultivated Aplanochytrium spp. and Oblongichytrium spp. Members of these 2 genera were also cultivated from 1 of the sediment samples. The 16 other <b>amplicons</b> were not closely related to cultivated strains, and 15 belonged to 5 groups of apparently novel labyrinthulomycetes. Most of the novel groups of <b>amplicons</b> also contained environmental sequences from surveys of protist diversity using universal 18 S rDNA primers. Because the primer LABY-Y is biased against several groups of labyrinthulomycetes, particularly among the thraustochytrids, these results may underestimate the undiscovered diversity of labyrinthulomycetes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Amplicons</b> are {{defective}} and non-integrative vectors {{derived from}} {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1.

Actinobacterial amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprints clustered by land use, with cultivated soils clustering apart from uncultivated soils. Actinobacterial <b>amplicons</b> generated with eubacterial primers were overwhelmingly from (116 / 126) street sediments; acidobacterial <b>amplicons</b> from soils (74 / 75).

2500|$|A major {{challenge}} in bisulfite sequencing is {{the degradation of}} DNA that takes place concurrently with the conversion. The conditions necessary for complete conversion, such as long incubation times, elevated temperature, and high bisulfite concentration, {{can lead to the}} degradation of about 90% of the incubated DNA. [...] Given that the starting amount of DNA is often limited, such extensive degradation can be problematic. The degradation occurs as depurinations resulting in random strand breaks. Therefore, the longer the desired PCR <b>amplicon,</b> the more limited the number of intact template molecules will likely be. This could lead to the failure of the PCR amplification, or the loss of quantitatively accurate information on methylation levels resulting from the limited sampling of template molecules. Thus, it is important to assess the amount of DNA degradation resulting from the reaction conditions employed, and consider how this will affect the desired <b>amplicon.</b> Techniques {{can also be used to}} minimize DNA degradation, such as cycling the incubation temperature.|$|E
2500|$|A further {{method to}} {{differentiate}} converted from unconverted bisulfite-treated DNA is using high-resolution melting analysis (HRM), a quantitative PCR-based technique initially designed to distinguish SNPs. [...] The PCR amplicons are analyzed directly by temperature ramping and resulting liberation of an intercalating fluorescent dye during melting. [...] The degree of methylation, {{as represented by}} the C-to-T content in the <b>amplicon,</b> determines the rapidity of melting and consequent release of the dye. [...] This method allows direct quantitation in a single-tube assay, but assesses methylation in the amplified region as a whole rather than at specific CpG sites.|$|E

Partial or complete nucleotide sequences were successfully determined for eight (one each from primer pairs D, E, and G; two from L; and three from Q) out of 13 <b>amplicons.</b> Conserved exon sequences and expected exon–intron motifs for the respective RP genes were confirmed in six <b>amplicons</b> from D, E, G, and Q, whereas these were not determined in two <b>amplicons</b> from L due to the short distance between the primer annealing site and an intron (see Table  1).

40|$|Differential display PCR (DD RT-PCR) {{has been}} {{extensively}} used for analysis of differential gene expression, but continues to be hampered by technical limitations that impair its effectiveness. In order to isolate novel genes co-expressing with human RAG 1, we have developed an effective, multi-tiered screening/purification approach which effectively complements the standard DD RT-PCR methodology. In 'primary' screens, standard DD RT-PCR was used, detecting 22 reproducible differentially expressed <b>amplicons</b> between clonally related cell variants with differential constitutive expression of RAG mRNAs. 'Secondary' screens used differential display (DD) <b>amplicons</b> as probes in low and high stringency northern blotting. Eight of 22 independent DD <b>amplicons</b> detected nine independent differentially expressed transcripts. 'Tertiary' screens used reconfirmed <b>amplicons</b> as probes in northern analysis of multiple RAG-and RAG+sources. Reconfirmed DD <b>amplicons</b> detected six independent RAG co-expressing transcripts. All DD <b>amplicons</b> reconfirmed by northern blot were a heterogeneous mixture of cDNAs, necessitating further purification to isolate single cDNAs prior to subcloning and sequencing. To effectively select the appropriate cDNAs from DD <b>amplicons,</b> we excised and eluted the cDNA(s) directly from regions of prior northern blots in which differentially expressed transcripts were detected. Sequences of six purified cDNA clones specifically detecting RAG co-expressing transcripts included matches to portions of the human RAG 2 and BSAP regions and to four novel partial cDNAs (three with homologies to human ESTs). Overall, our results also suggest that even when using clonally related variants from the same cell line {{in addition to all}} appropriate internal controls previously reported, further screening and purification steps are still required in order to efficiently and specifically isolate differentially expressed genes by DD RT-PCR...|$|R
2500|$|Occasionally, {{within a}} sample of {{individuals}} such as in paternity testing casework, a mutation in the DNA flanking the microsatellite can prevent the PCR primer from binding and producing an <b>amplicon</b> (creating a [...] "null allele" [...] in a gel assay), thus only one allele is amplified (from the non-mutated sister chromosome), and the individual may then falsely appear to be homozygous. This can cause confusion in paternity casework. It may then be necessary to amplify the microsatellite using {{a different set of}} primers.

Basically, the same thermodynamic properties that {{allowed for the}} gel techniques to work apply here, and in real-time. A fluorimeter monitors the post-PCR denaturation of the entire dsDNA <b>amplicon.</b> You make primers specific to the site you want to amplify. You [...] "paint" [...] the <b>amplicon</b> with a double-strand specific dye, included in the PCR mix. The ds-specific dye integrates itself into the PCR product. In essence, the entire <b>amplicon</b> becomes a probe. This opens up new possibilities for discovery. Either you position the primers very close {{to either side of}} the SNP in question (small <b>amplicon</b> genotyping, Liew, 2004) or amplify a larger region (100-400bp in length) for scanning purposes. For simple genotyping of an SNP, it is easier to just make the <b>amplicon</b> small to minimize the chances you mistake one SNP for another. The melting temperature (Tm) of the entire <b>amplicon</b> is determined and most homozygotes are sufficiently different (in the better instruments) in Tm to genotype. Heterozygotes are even easier to differentiate because they have heteroduplexes generated (refer to the gel-based explanations) which broadens the melt transition and usually gives two discernible peaks. <b>Amplicon</b> melting using a fluorescently-labeled primer has been described (Gundry et al., 2003) but is less practical than using ds-specific dyes due to the cost of the fluorogenic primer.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMetabarcoding is a {{powerful}} tool for exploring microbial diversity in the environment, but its accurate interpretation is impeded by diverse technical (e. g.

To help interpret environmental metabarcoding datasets, we investigated the intracellular diversity of the V 4 and V 9 regions of the 18 S rRNA gene from Acantharia and Nassellaria (radiolarians) using 454 pyrosequencing. Individual cells of radiolarians were isolated, and PCRs were performed with generalist primers to amplify the V 4 and V 9 regions. Different denoising procedures were employed to filter the pyrosequenced raw <b>amplicons</b> (Acacia, AmpliconNoise, Linkage method). For each of the six isolated cells, an average of 541 V 4 and 562 V 9 <b>amplicons</b> assigned to radiolarians were obtained, from which one numerically dominant sequence and several minor variants were found. At the 97 % identity, a diversity metrics commonly used in environmental surveys, up to 5 distinct OTUs were detected in a single cell. However, most <b>amplicons</b> grouped within a single OTU whereas other OTUs contained very few <b>amplicons.</b> Different analytical methods provided evidence that most minor variants forming different OTUs correspond to PCR and sequencing artifacts. Duplicate PCR and sequencing from the same DNA extract of a single cell had only 9 to 16 % of unique <b>amplicons</b> in common, and alignment visualization of V 4 and V 9 <b>amplicons</b> showed that most minor variants contained substitutions in highly-conserved regions. We conclude that intracellular variability of the 18 S rRNA in radiolarians is very limited despite its multi-copy nature and the existence of multiple nuclei in these protists.
