When gay activists interrupted him and demanded he address their issues, he quickly left without a response, and San Francisco Democratic organizers and liberal politicians were furious at the gay activists.|$|E

Jay-Z performed his rap scenes first, [...] afterwards Knowles studied his scene, and then did her impersonation of him. Melina said: [...] "If anybody knows Jay-Z, it would be Beyoncé". Knowles commented on her impersonation of Jay-Z on MTV, [...] "I love what I did in [...] because it's completely out of my character, {{or at least the}} character that people think I am. I was pretending to be Jay, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> and I told him he had to leave, because I couldn't do it with him in the room — it was way too embarrassing. I think I did a pretty good job. I had the lip curl down!"

2500|$|In 1846 Anderson {{became the}} first Texan {{appointed}} to the United States Military Academy at West Point. He had been recommended by Texas' founder, Sam Houston, and he began attending on September 1.

Despite this, in 1856 Anderson was directly commissioned into the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant on June 27.

2500|$|... "Life Goes On" [...] (...) is {{an article}} {{published}} in the 3 September 2008 issue of the Russian Ministry of Defence's official newspaper, Krasnaya Zvezda. It was also posted on the newspaper's web site. The article was based on the interview of an officer who had taken part in the military operation in South Ossetia in August 2008. After the initial publication, it was picked up by blogs and internet news agencies, as it contradicted the official timeline of Russian incursion into South Ossetia. However, the article was later corrected. Soon, the article was pulled from the newspaper's web site, the disappearance having been commented upon by the mainstream media, including The New York Times. The article details the war experience of Russian captain of the 135th regiment named Denis Sidristy. He said that his unit had been ordered to cease a training exercise and move to Tskhinvali on August 7, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> when the hostilities broke out. Sidristy said that he witnessed the Georgian attack on Tskhinvali around midnight.|$|E
2500|$|On April 7, 2006, Sedaka was {{appearing}} at the Royal Albert Hall and filming for the above-referenced CD/DVD package, {{when he was}} interrupted mid-concert by a gentleman who walked onstage from the wings.

But at the interruption, a seemingly annoyed Sedaka asked, [...] "What is this?" [...] The interloper was a representative from Guinness Records, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to present Sedaka with an award from Guinness World Records: [...] British Hit Singles and Albums for composing [...] "(Is This the Way to) Amarillo?", the most successful UK single of the 21st century (up to that date, of course).

His father died while he was quite young and he was raised by his maternal uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid `Alí, who was also a merchant. He claimed to be a descendant from Muhammad (a sayyid) through Husayn ibn Ali through both his parents. When he was in Shiraz his uncle sent him to maktab (primary school) <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> for six or seven years. Sometime between when he was 15 and 20, he joined his uncle in the family business, a trading house, and became a merchant in the city of Bushehr, Iran, near the Persian Gulf. Some of his earlier writings suggest that he did not enjoy the business and instead applied himself to the study of religious literature. One of his contemporary followers described him as [...] "very taciturn, and [...] would never utter a word unless it was absolutely necessary. He did not even answer our questions. He was constantly absorbed in his own thoughts, and was preoccupied with repetition of his prayers and verses. He is described as a handsome man with a thin beard, dressed in clean clothes, wearing a green shawl and a black turban." ...|$|E
