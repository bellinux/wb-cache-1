5|$|Motivations for {{clitoral}} modification and mutilation vary. Those taking hormones {{or other}} medications {{as part of}} female-to-male transition usually experience dramatic clitoral growth; individual desires and the difficulties of phalloplasty (construction of <b>a</b> <b>penis)</b> often result in the retention of the original genitalia with the enlarged clitoris as <b>a</b> <b>penis</b> analogue (metoidioplasty). However, the clitoris cannot reach {{the size of the}} penis through hormones. A surgery to add function to the clitoris, such as metoidioplasty, is an alternative to phalloplasty that permits retention of sexual sensation in the clitoris.|$|E
5|$|Chris angrily demands Leslie {{bring the}} {{painting}} to city hall {{the next day to}} be destroyed. When Leslie reluctantly agrees to do so, Jerry expresses disappointment that she would give up so easily. Feeling empowered again, Leslie asks Jerry to quickly paint another, similar painting, only this time with Tom as the centaur. Leslie tells Marcia the new painting is the original one but painted over. With no more nudity in the painting, a frustrated Marcia gives up her quest to have the painting destroyed. Tom is delighted with the painting until he realizes that Jerry forgot to draw <b>a</b> <b>penis</b> on the centaur. Ben later confides to Andy he likes Leslie but is unable to ask her out because of Chris, but Andy tells him if they truly care about each other, then it will eventually happen.|$|E
5|$|Erik and Ashley begin dating, but {{on their}} first date at a restaurant, Erik has hot soup spilled accidentally on his legs, so Ashley brings him to her room to clean up. As Ashley rubs lotion on Erik's thigh, he {{develops}} an involuntary erection and accidentally ejaculates over her possessions. Erik apologizes and explains to Ashley that, after breaking up with Tracy, he has not ejaculated in four months, masturbation being a taboo in his house because of a previous incident. Meanwhile, Cooze {{falls in love with}} Ashley's roommate Denise; however, she is nervous about showing her genitalia and having sex with him, so she gives Cooze a handjob instead. After talking with Erik, Bobby, and Dwight about Denise, Cooze develops suspicions that Denise might have <b>a</b> <b>penis,</b> so Dwight encourages him to find out.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> stag's <b>penis</b> forms <b>an</b> S-shaped curve {{when it is}} not erect, and is {{retracted}} {{into its}} sheath by the retractor penis muscle. Some deer species spray urine on their bodies by urinating from <b>an</b> erect <b>penis.</b> One type of scent-marking behavior in elk is known as [...] "thrash-urination, which typically involves palpitation of the erect <b>penis.</b> <b>A</b> male elk's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the <b>penis.</b> <b>A</b> sambar stag will mark himself by spraying urine directly in the face with <b>a</b> highly mobile <b>penis,</b> which is often erect during its rutting activities. Red deer stags often have erect penises during combat.|$|R
5|$|Males within Palaeognathae (with the {{exception}} of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with {{the exception}} of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess <b>a</b> <b>penis,</b> which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.|$|E
5|$|Near the Congo River {{a female}} who participates in strong {{emotional}} or sexual relationships with another female among the Nkundo people {{is known as}} yaikya bonsángo (a woman who presses against another woman). Lesbian relationships are also known in matrilineal societies in Ghana among the Akan people. In Lesotho, females engage in what is commonly considered sexual behavior to the Western world: they kiss, sleep together, rub genitals, participate in cunnilingus, and maintain their relationships with other females vigilantly. Since the people of Lesotho believe sex requires <b>a</b> <b>penis,</b> however, they do not consider their behavior sexual, nor label themselves lesbians.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before she}} turned 15, Falle met two child prostitutes {{who were also}} in their early teens. One of these girls was {{pregnant}} by her 42-year-old pimp. The two girls offered Falle {{a place to sleep}} at their apartment while their pimp was away; feeling there was no alternative, she accepted. Out of concern for Falle's safety, they taught her how to put a condom on <b>a</b> <b>penis</b> by practicing on a cucumber. These children effectively groomed Falle. She stayed at the apartment for several days, and she was watched by various men. By the time the pimp returned, Falle had moved on.|$|E

5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{the human}} female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. In humans and other mammals, it develops from an outgrowth in the embryo called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either <b>a</b> <b>penis</b> or a clitoris, depending on {{the presence or absence}} of the protein tdf, which is codified by a single gene on the Y chromosome. The clitoris is a complex structure, and its size and sensitivity can vary. The glans (head) of the human clitoris is roughly the size and shape of a pea, and is estimated to have more than 8,000 sensory nerve endings.|$|E
5|$|Imposex has {{recently}} been detected in Laevistrombus canarium. Imposex {{is the development of}} male sex organs in female animals exposed to man-made organic tin compounds, such as tributyltin (TBT). It has negative consequences for several species of sea snails, ranging from sterility in some individuals to the extinction of entire populations. Tin compounds are biocidal anti-fouling agents mixed into paints to prevent marine encrustations on boats and ships. High concentrations of these compounds are commonly present in seawater near shipyards and docking areas, exposing nearby marine life to harmful effects. In a 2011 paper, Cob and colleagues found that imposex rates are high in dog conch populations near Malaysian ports; however, the researchers could not detect any cases of sterility in affected females. The authors concluded that females of L.canarium often develop <b>a</b> <b>penis</b> when seawater contains organotin compounds, but the phenomenon does not cause sterility in this species. The ability of the dog conch to survive despite imposex makes this species a suitable local bioindicator for organotin pollution.|$|E
5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the female}} closely resembles that of the male; the clitoris is shaped and positioned like <b>a</b> <b>penis,</b> and is capable of erection. The female also possesses no external vagina (vaginal opening), as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum. The pseudo-penis is traversed to its tip by a central urogenital canal, through which the female urinates, copulates and gives birth. The pseudo-penis can be distinguished from the males' genitalia by its greater thickness and more rounded glans. In both males and females, {{the base of the}} glans is covered with penile spines. The formation of the pseudo-penis appears largely androgen independent, as the pseudo-penis appears in the female fetus before differentiation of the fetal ovary and adrenal gland. After parturition, the pseudo-penis is stretched, and loses many of its original aspects; it becomes a slack-walled and reduced prepuce with an enlarged orifice with split lips.|$|E

5|$|Theophrastus groups {{together}} the cereals and the legumes (peas and beans), and includes millet and other many-seeded plants like sesame also. These {{can only be}} grown from seed. They can be sown early, as with wheat, barley and beans, or in spring after the equinox, for plants like lentils, tares and peas. Vetch and chickpeas can, he reports, be sown at either season. When sprouting, beans form a shape like <b>a</b> <b>penis,</b> from which the root grows down and the leafy stem upwards. Wheat and barley flower {{for four or five}} days, whereas the legumes flower for much longer. Theophrastus reports that these plants grow differently according to the region, so for instance crops in Salamis appear earlier than those elsewhere in Attica. Wheat varieties are recorded as being named for their localities; they differ in colour, size, growth habit and food value. In a place near Bactra in Asia the wheat grains are said to grow as big as the stone of an olive, whereas pulses do not in Theophrastus's view vary to the same extent.|$|E
25|$|In a small study {{conducted}} by University of Texas–Pan American and published in BMC Women's Health, 50 undergraduate women were surveyed by two popular male athletes on campus about their perceptions of sexual satisfaction and {{it was concluded that}} the width of <b>a</b> <b>penis</b> feels better than the length of <b>a</b> <b>penis,</b> when subjects are asked to choose between the two (size was left unspecified). It was also concluded that this may show that penis size overall affects sexual satisfaction since women chose between the two options they were given.|$|E
