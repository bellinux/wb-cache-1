5|$|Carex binervis is {{classified}} in Carex subsection Elatae, part of Carex section Spirostachyae, alongside C.laevigata <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>species.</b> Natural hybrids are known between C.binervis {{and various other}} Carex species, including C.laevigata (forming C.×deserta), C.viridula (forming C.×corstorphinei), C.punctata and C.flava.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{protozoa}} can cause gastroenteritis – most commonly Giardia lamblia – but Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> {{have also been}} implicated. As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children. Giardia occurs more commonly in the developing world, but this etiologic agent causes this type of illness to some degree nearly everywhere. It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend day care, {{men who have sex}} with men, and following disasters.|$|E
5|$|Although not as {{significant}} as deforestation and hunting, some lemurs, such as crowned lemurs <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> that have successfully been kept in captivity, are occasionally kept as exotic pets by Malagasy people. Bamboo lemurs are also kept as pets, although they only survive {{for up to two}} months. Live capture for the exotic pet trade in wealthier countries is not normally considered a threat due to strict regulations controlling their export.|$|E
25|$|Invasive {{plants are}} those {{introduced}} species that dominate a landscape pushing out traditionally native <b>species</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>species</b> by {{their ability to}} multiply rapidly. There are 54 such species in the dunes.|$|R
50|$|New Guinea shares {{three species}} of {{cockatoos}} <b>and</b> five <b>other</b> <b>species</b> of parrots with neighbouring Australia <b>and</b> <b>other</b> islands. 38 <b>species</b> of parrots are endemic {{to the island}} of New Guinea and minor offshore islands.|$|R

5|$|Amanita ocreata {{is highly}} toxic, {{and has been}} {{responsible}} for mushroom poisonings in western North America, particularly in the spring. It contains highly toxic amatoxins, as well as phallotoxins, a feature shared with the closely related death cap (A. phalloides), half a cap of which can be enough to kill a human, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> known as destroying angels. There is some evidence it may be the most toxic of all the North American phalloideae, as a higher proportion of people consuming it had organ damage and 40% perished. Dogs have also been known to consume this fungus in California with fatal results.|$|E
5|$|Males of fly {{species such}} as Cuterebra, many hover flies, bee flies (Bombyliidae) and fruit flies (Tephritidae) {{maintain}} territories within which they engage in aerial pursuit to drive away intruding males <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>species.</b> While these territories may be held by individual males, some species form leks with many males aggregating in displays. Some flies maintain an airspace and still others form dense swarms that maintain a stationary location with respect to landmarks. Many flies mate in flight while swarming.|$|E
5|$|Mammals in {{this area}} include bison, deer, pronghorn, coyotes, and prairie dogs. The state bird, the ring-necked pheasant, has adapted well to the area after being {{introduced}} from China. Growing populations of bald eagles are spread throughout the state, especially near the Missouri River. Rivers and lakes of the grasslands support populations of walleye, carp, pike, bass, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>species.</b> The Missouri River also contains the pre-historic paddlefish.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} birds are {{economically}} important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds (poultry and game) being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> are popular as pets. Guano (bird excrement) is harvested {{for use as a}} fertiliser. Birds prominently figure throughout human culture. About 120–130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching {{is an important part of}} the ecotourism industry.|$|E
5|$|Omnivorous mammals such as {{the raccoon}} and skunk and {{herbivore}} mammal species {{such as the}} porcupine and pika, are common to the forest. The beaver is considered a species of special interest to Shoshone National Forest since its dam building activities improve habitat for numerous other species such as the moose, breeding waterfowl, various amphibians <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> dependent on a riparian environment.|$|E
5|$|Pale {{crag martin}} pairs often nest alone, {{especially}} in the Sahara, although where suitable sites are available small loose colonies may form. This martin aggressively defends its nesting territory against conspecifics <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>species.</b> In Africa breeding dates vary geographically and with local weather conditions, but in northwest Africa February to April is normal, and in Asia nesting is from April to June. Two broods are common, and three have been raised in a season.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps seen by Amerigo Vespucci in 1503, it {{was first}} {{formally}} described in 1839. Its subsequent taxonomic history has been complex, riddled with confusion with Trachylepis maculata <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>species,</b> homonyms, and other problems. The species is classified in the otherwise mostly African genus Trachylepis and {{is thought to have}} reached its island from Africa by rafting. The enigmatic Trachylepis tschudii, supposedly from Peru, may well be the same species.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} Lactarius, Lactifluus and Russula are valued as {{excellent}} edible mushrooms. This {{is the case}} for example for the north temperate species Lactarius deliciosus, Lactifluus volemus, or Russula vesca, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> are popular {{in other parts of the}} world, e.g. Lactarius indigo in Mexico, or Lactifluus edulis in tropical Africa. Some species, like Russula vesca, can even be eaten raw. The brittle texture of Russula fruitbodies makes them different from other mushrooms and is not appreciated by some.|$|E
5|$|Textiles {{from the}} most {{utilitarian}} to the most luxurious are made from animal fibres such as wool, camel hair, angora, cashmere, and mohair. Hunter-gatherers have used animal sinews as lashings and bindings. Leather from cattle, pigs <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> is widely used to make shoes, handbags, belts and many other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur, to make items such as coats and hats, again ranging from simply warm and practical to the most elegant and expensive.|$|E

5|$|The American robin is a known {{reservoir}} (carrier) for West Nile virus. While crows and jays {{are often}} the first noticed deaths in an area with West Nile virus, the American robin is suspected {{to be a key}} host, and holds a larger responsibility for the transmission of the virus to humans. This is because, while crows and jays die quickly from the virus, the American robin survives the virus longer, hence spreading it to more mosquitoes, which then transmit the virus to humans <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|The genus was {{formerly}} {{considered to be}} a large one with well over 100 species. However, molecular analysis of DNA sequences showed that the most species belonged in the family Psathyrellaceae, distinct from the type species that belonged to the Agaricaceae. It was given its current binomial name in 2001 as a result, as this <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> were moved to the new genus Coprinopsis.|$|E
5|$|The isles provide nesting for a {{population}} of seabirds, including Atlantic puffins, northern fulmars, European storm-petrels, Leach's petrels, common shag, and black-legged kittiwakes. There is a gannetry on Roaireim. From the late Middle Ages on, Lewismen regularly raided these nests for eggs, birds, and feathers. There is {{a population}} of rabbits, brought to the islands by the lighthouse keepers, and crofters from Bernera graze sheep on the most fertile islands. Minke and pilot whales, as well as Risso's <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> of dolphin are commonly observed in the vicinity.|$|E

5|$|The shock {{from the}} Japanese sleeper ray is strong but not {{life-threatening}} to humans. There is an observation of a ray that reacted to being touched {{with a camera}} by rubbing its back against the camera port, suggesting that it may actively defend itself if disturbed. The Japanese sleeper ray adapts poorly to captivity. This <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> of electric rays are used in biomedical research because their electric organs have an abundance of ion channels and acetylcholine receptors, and {{can serve as a}} model for the human nervous system.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} meat ants {{depends on what}} {{resource}} they are dealing with. In one study, the removal of meat ants allowed the successful foraging of Iridomyrmex ants at carbohydrate sources, but not for protein baits. The success of the ants also did not increase with mealworm baits, suggesting that competition does not always occur between meat ants <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>species,</b> and factors, such as food preference, may be involved. In contrast with camponotines and some myrmicines, both of their success was affected at numerous food sources with meat ants present. Camponotines exhibit no aggression and cannot defend themselves.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater breeds in monogamous pairs in a {{breeding}} season that extends from July to March, with migrating birds nesting later than sedentary birds. They nest solitarily in all-purpose territories that both parents defend against conspecifics <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>species</b> including thornbills, spinebills, and silvereyes, although the male {{is involved in}} more aggressive interactions than the female. Within {{a breeding}} season females lay two or three clutches of eggs, re-nesting with the same partner in the same territory. Banded birds {{have been identified in}} the same territory for periods of up to five years.|$|E
