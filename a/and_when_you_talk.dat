40|$|Preserving {{the past}} for the future Cue: Throughout Africa there are {{indigenous}} fruits ? for which {{there are lots of}} uses ? that have not really got the attention or protection they deserve. The dika nut in Nigeria and Gabon, the amarula in Kenya: these are all indigenous tree products that are now being recognized as well worth investing in. Are there other indigenous fruits that are not getting the attention or protection that they deserve? Alice Muchugi of the World Agro Forestry in Kenya has been studying the variety of indigenous trees in Kenya. Her work has been a hunt for the sweetest, the juiciest and the highest value fruits to be found. As she explained to Eric Kadenge, for some trees there is a race against time. IN:	?The fruits are normally harvested from the forests? OUT:	?because they can see the benefit. ? DUR?N:	 3 ? 25 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Alice Muchugi of the World Agro Forestry Centre in Kenya speaking about the importance of our indigenous trees, and the best ways to preserve them. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Muchugi	The fruits are normally harvested from the forest. We no longer have all those vast forests that we were having. We have the forest degradation, so one main problem is that in future, they will not be common, and that is where we try to say that the future of the forest is on the farm itself. For the farmer to plant, there must be a reason why the farmer is planting, it is not just for the local consumption, but if there is a value addition to these fruits, in one way or the other, like for processing or making it more marketable it will have more economic value to the farmer {{and they are going to}} plant them more. Kadenge	And the information that you are gathering are you also trying to find a way of delivering or providing this information to these farmers? Muchugi	We look at how the plants vary from one region to the other because there are differences. Some may be sweeter, others may be growing faster, and different characteristics of the fruit, maybe others produce a lot of juice for those which may be going under processing and all that. But we want to know whether this is linked to genetic differences. So when we carry out genetic analysis, which is very important when it comes to conservation, because this is the material, when you take it to the farm, which will persist in future. So what we find out now we link up with our counterparts. We are getting now to the farmers or to the research institutes, where they are carrying out the work. Kadenge	Now other than the scientific knowledge that you are gathering from these trees, do you also incorporate any local knowledge on the same? Muchugi	Yes when we go out on the collections we do talk to the indigenous people, the locals. Actually we know the importance of this from the locals themselves because they will tell you ?we do this we do that? and of course you will first notice from the importance they put on that tree and it is by talking to them that we know this is important, they use it for this and that, because they themselves they will tell us and of course we have to try and see, maybe there is an aspect these people know that we can utilise and use it further from a scientific perspective. Some of the differences these farmers see may be linked up to the genetic differences. The sweetness, they grow faster, the shape of the fruits and all that. So that is a good thing that they do help us out. We link up with what we have and what we are analysing and try to up-grade or use it too for their benefit. Kadenge	What are the benefits of some of these fruit trees like the baobab or the ones you have mentioned? Muchugi	The Indigenous fruits are also very rich in nutrients, especially vitamins. The tamarindus we have is quite rich in proteins and carbohydrates, and it is also rich in minerals like calcium phosphorous, iron. But if the farmers can now plant on the farms themselves they have a cheaper source of the nutrients. Kadenge	Do we have some of these indigenous fruit trees on people?s farms here in Kenya for example? Muchugi	Tamarindus used to occur naturally, you find it on the farmer?s fields. Kadenge	<b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about the local communities, how can they preserve the diversity of the indigenous fruits? Muchugi	The local communities themselves, for conservation is of course now in the collection of the material from the wild, and bringing them on the farm, in other words called domestication because you are bringing it from the forest and putting it on the farm. And that is one of the major ways of conservation. Because the tree will be there, the farmer is benefiting, they are not cutting it because they can see the benefit. End of track.

40|$|These {{milestones}} {{show how}} children begin {{to connect to}} the human community. The approximate age for each milestone is based on research (with {{a wide range of}} methodologies) with young children that demonstrated the achievement is possible. This is a partial list drawn from the author’s book Raising Courageous Kids. 1 This checklist represents overall age trends. Individual differences exist in the precise age at which children achieve each milestone. Children learn these milestones through playful and sensitive interaction with parents and other loving caregivers, not through formal instruction. A developmental timetable is operating here that cannot be artificially accelerated. A child’s temperament will influence the timing and frequency of these milestones. Children who were born premature will acquire the milestones later. Failure to observe milestone behavior is not evidence that the child has failed to achieve that milestone. These milestones are not solitary achievements. They reflect accomplishments achieved in a partnership between loving parents and their children. Conversely, failure to achieve a milestone may be a statement about the quality of that relationship. Developmental delays in these milestones could be due to neurological problems outside of a parent’s control. 3 months Responds to you (and other friendly people) with a true social smile at @six weeks (Eliot, 1999, 301) Responds with sound <b>and</b> movement <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> to her; has good eye contact with you (eyes brighten) Engages in brief face-to-face interaction with you that is emotionally satisfying and positively arousing (mutual affect synchrony).

Lancashire's veteran wicket-keeper Hegg was impressed by Cross, and said [...] "He has a really good work ethic, <b>and</b> he listens <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> about the game.

He batted just once in the match, scoring two runs, although he dismissed five batsmen, one by stumping and four caught. His second opportunity to play first-class cricket came in the last match of the season; with Lancashire's stalwart Warren Hegg injured, Cross was given the responsibility of taking over as wicket-keeper. Playing in the County Championship for the [...] first time, according to The Wisden Cricketer Cross [...] "showed enough pure technique to deserve his chance to develop". Although Hegg retired {{at the end of}} the season, Lancashire quickly signed experienced wicket-keeper Luke Sutton from Derbyshire, hampering Cross' chances to regularly play first-team cricket. In the 2005/06 Australian cricket season, Cross travelled to the southern hemisphere to play for St Kilda Cricket Club in the Victorian Premier Cricket. He spent most of the season playing for the club's second team.|$|R

6000|$|But of {{one thing}} I must warn you, that you must not {{confound}} Madam How and Lady Why. Many people do it, and fall into great mistakes thereby,--mistakes that even a little child, if it would think, need not commit. But really great philosophers sometimes make this mistake about Why and How; and therefore {{it is no wonder}} if other people make it too, when they write children's books about the wonders of nature, and call them [...] "Why and Because," [...] or [...] "The Reason Why." [...] The books are very good books, and you should read and study them: but they do not tell you really [...] "Why and Because," [...] but only [...] "How and So." [...] They do not tell you the [...] "Reason Why" [...] things happen, but only [...] "The Way in which they happen." [...] However, I must not blame these good folks, for I have made the same mistake myself often, and may do it again: but all the more shame to me. For see--you know perfectly the difference between How <b>and</b> Why, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are <b>talking</b> about yourself. If I ask you, [...] "Why did we go out to-day?" [...] You would not answer, [...] "Because we opened the door." [...] That is the answer to [...] "How did we go out?" [...] The answer to Why did we go out is, [...] "Because we chose to take a walk." [...] Now when we talk about other things beside ourselves, we must remember this same difference between How and Why. If I ask you, [...] "Why does fire burn you?" [...] you would answer, I suppose, being a little boy, [...] "Because it is hot;" [...] which is all you know about it. But if you were a great chemist, instead of a little boy, you would be apt to answer me, I am afraid, [...] "Fire burns because the vibratory motion of the molecules of the heated substance communicates itself to the molecules of my skin, and so destroys their tissue;" [...] which is, I dare say, quite true: but it only tells us how fire burns, the way or means by which it burns; it does not tell us the reason why it burns.|$|R
