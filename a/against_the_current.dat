5|$|The Anahuac Disturbances in 1832 {{were the}} first open revolt against Mexican rule and they coincided with a revolt in Mexico against the nation's president. Texians sided with the federalists <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> {{government}} and drove all Mexican soldiers out of East Texas. They {{took advantage of the}} lack of oversight to agitate for more political freedom. Texians met at the Convention of 1832 to discuss requesting independent statehood, among other issues. The following year, Texians reiterated their demands at the Convention of 1833.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year LeMond began the 1994 Tour de France but found {{he was unable}} to race effectively. He had to abandon after the first week before the race had reached the difficult mountain stages. That December he announced his retirement. At the time the reasons for LeMond's increasing difficulties were not entirely known. At a loss, he speculated that a condition known as mitochondrial myopathy might be responsible for the difficulty he was having performing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> riders. In 2007, however, LeMond speculated that he might not have had the condition after all, and suggested that lead toxicity from the shotgun pellets still embedded in his body might have been responsible, the effects of which were increased by heavy training.|$|E

5|$|At 20:45, with Jason {{far behind}} in the darkness, Mars hauled up and Hood {{attempted}} to manoeuvre into an effective position from which to attack the waiting Hercule. The vagaries of the current in the Raz de Sein passage prevented Hood from handling his ship effectively however and instead he resolved on bringing Mars directly alongside and fighting broadside to broadside. At 21:15 Mars was in range and L'Héritier opened fire, Hood replying immediately. For ten minutes, the masts and rigging of Mars came under fire, with damage to the bowsprit and foremast, as Hood continued to attempt to hold his firing position <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> before pulling slightly ahead of Hercule at 21:25 and dropping anchor. The port bow anchor became entangled with the starboard anchor on Hercule and the British ship was swung violently into the French ship, {{the force of the}} collision unhinging four of the gunports on Mars.|$|E
5|$|In both {{of these}} instances, a failed retreat by Hybrida and his cavalry led to his unit being {{absolutely}} defeated and any plunder accrued during the attack was forfeited back to the natives. This lack of success, rather than the extortion of the provincials, drew {{the attention of the}} Senate who threatened to recall and prosecute Hybrida for his mismanagement of the province. In 60 BC, Hybrida was quietly replaced by Gaius Octavius as the Governor of Macedonia and in March of 59 BC, during the consulship of Caesar and Marcus Culpurnius Bibulus, was prosecuted for the mishandling of the governorship by Caesar and Crassus. In the end, Hybrida was tried by Marcus Caelius Rufus for his participation in the Catilinarian conspiracy and by Lucius Caninius Gallus for his crimes in Macedonia. He was defended by Cicero, not out of duty but as a protest <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> state of affairs in Rome. Despite this, Hybrida was found guilty of his crimes, ordered to pay a fine and be banished from Rome to a place of his choosing. Hybrida had settled upon Cephallenia as his residence for the duration of his exile.|$|E

25|$|Bustamante outlawed the {{immigration}} of United States citizens to Texas in 1830. Several new presidios {{were established in}} the region to monitor immigration and customs practices. The new laws also called for the enforcement of customs duties, angering both native Mexican citizens (Tejanos) and Anglos. In 1832, a group of men led a revolt against customs enforcement in Anahuac. These Anahuac Disturbances coincided with a revolt in Mexico <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> president.

Struggling <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>currents</b> {{of human nature and}} society, they may lose more often than they win—but only rarely do they give up. This universal trait is a reflection of Balzac's own social wrangling, that of his family, and an interest in the Austrian mystic and physician Franz Mesmer, who pioneered the study of animal magnetism. Balzac spoke often of a [...] "nervous and fluid force" [...] between individuals, and Raphaël de Valentin's decline in La Peau de Chagrin exemplifies the danger of withdrawing from other people's company.|$|R

It was this internalization process that interested Artaud most, often focusing on man’s struggle against elemental forces, a significant theme in his “Theater of Cruelty” and the 1935 staging of “The Cenci”. Dullin recorded an exercise he gave to Artaud in which he was to mime his struggle <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>currents</b> of a river. Artaud was quoted as saying of Dullin, “Hearing Dullin teach I feel that I’m rediscovering ancient secrets and a whole forgotten mystique of production”.|$|R
