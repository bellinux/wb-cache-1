Four are Sites of Special Scientific Interest, {{and five}} are {{managed by the}} Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire. The largest is Little Paxton Pits at sixty hectares, which is of {{national}} importance for wintering wildfowl, and the smallest is St Denis Churchyard, East Hatley, which has grassland with diverse flowers.

5|$|As of May 2017, {{there are}} 18 Local Nature Reserves in Northamptonshire, {{and there is}} public access to <b>all</b> <b>sites.</b> Twelve are managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire, and two are also Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Ramsar internationally {{important}} wetland sites, and Special Protection Areas under the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds. The largest site is Titchmarsh Nature Reserve at , which has nationally important numbers of goosanders, wigeons and gadwalls in winter. The smallest is Great Oakley Meadow, which has prominent surviving ridge and furrow from the medieval ploughing system.|$|E
5|$|Dermotherium is a genus {{of fossil}} mammals {{closely related to}} the living colugos, a small group of gliding mammals from Southeast Asia. Two species are recognized: D.major from the Late Eocene of Thailand, based on a single {{fragment}} of the lower jaw, and D.chimaera from the Late Oligocene of Thailand, known from three fragments of the lower jaw and two isolated upper molars. In addition, a single isolated upper molar from the Early Oligocene of Pakistan has been tentatively assigned to D.chimaera. <b>All</b> <b>sites</b> where fossils of Dermotherium have been found probably developed in forested environments and the fossil species probably were forest dwellers like living colugos, but whether they already had the gliding adaptations of the living species is unknown.|$|E

There was also an explosion at Mazagaon, in Mumbai's port area, and in a taxi at Vile Parle. By the early morning of 28 November, <b>all</b> <b>sites</b> except for the Taj Hotel had been secured by Mumbai Police Department and security forces.

5|$|Ions {{typically}} pack into extremely regular crystalline structures, in {{an arrangement}} that minimizes the lattice energy (maximizing attractions and minimizing repulsions). The lattice energy is the summation of the interaction of <b>all</b> <b>sites</b> with all other sites. For unpolarizable spherical ions only the charges and distances are required to determine the electrostatic interaction energy. For any particular ideal crystal structure, all distances are geometrically related to the smallest internuclear distance. So for each possible crystal structure, the total electrostatic energy {{can be related to}} the electrostatic energy of unit charges at the nearest neighbour distance by a multiplicative constant called the Madelung constant that can be efficiently computed using an Ewald sum. When a reasonable form is assumed for the additional repulsive energy, the total lattice energy can be modelled using the Born–Landé equation, the Born–Mayer equation, or in the absence of structural information, the Kapustinskii equation.|$|E

40|$|Memristors {{are used}} to compare three {{gathering}} techniques in an already-mapped environment where resource locations are known. The <b>All</b> <b>Site</b> model, which apportions gatherers based on the modeled memristance of that path, proves {{to be good at}} increasing overall efficiency and decreasing time to fully deplete an environment, however it only works well when the resources are of similar quality. The Leaf Cutter method, based on Leaf Cutter Ant behaviour, assigns all gatherers first to the best resource, and once depleted, uses the <b>All</b> <b>Site</b> model to spread them out amongst the rest. The Leaf Cutter model is better at increasing resource influx in the short-term and vastly out-performs the <b>All</b> <b>Site</b> model in a more varied environments. It is demonstrated that memristor based abstractions of gatherer models provide potential methods for both the comparison and implementation of agent controls.

This process is critical for the directory in striving to achieve one of its founding goals: to reduce the link rot in web directories. Shortly after each run, the sites marked with errors are automatically moved to the unreviewed queue where editors may investigate them when time permits.|$|E
25|$|To further {{highlight}} {{the difference between}} a problem and an instance, consider the following instance of the decision version of the traveling salesman problem: Is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germany's 15 largest cities? The quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem, such as asking for a round trip through <b>all</b> <b>sites</b> in Milan whose total length is at most 10km. For this reason, complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances.|$|E

25|$|As of 2008, {{the organic}} {{contaminants}} monitored by Mussel Watch included 51 PCB congeners (out {{of a possible}} 209), 65 PAHs, DDT, butyltin, chlordane, and dieldrin. A complete list is available at http://NSandT.noaa.gov. Most of the organic contaminants monitored by Mussel Watch have an anthropogenic source, with PAHs being an exception as they are derived from both natural processes and anthropogenic sources. PCB congeners were selected based off a list of criteria including that the chosen congeners are already being measured by other scientific organizations. Organic contaminants can be compared across <b>all</b> <b>sites</b> and all species used by Mussel Watch.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of partial agonism of the high-affinity state of the D2 receptor (and indirect/downstream activation of AMPA receptors), all of these actions are far weaker than ketamine's antagonism of the NMDA receptor (see table to the right; minimum of more than 10-fold selectivity for the NMDA receptor relative to the site with the next highest affinity). A binding study assessed ketamine at 56sites including neurotransmitter receptors and transporters and found that ketamine had Ki values of >10,000nM at <b>all</b> <b>sites</b> except the dizocilpine site of the NMDA receptor (Ki = 659nM), indicating a minimum of 15-fold selectivity for the NMDA receptor over any other site.|$|E

25|$|Collaboration systems {{utilizing}} Operational Transformations typically use replicated document storage, {{where each}} client {{has their own}} copy of the document; clients operate on their local copies in a lock-free, non-blocking manner, and the changes are then propagated {{to the rest of}} the clients; this ensures the client high responsiveness in an otherwise high-latency environment such as the Internet. When a client receives the changes propagated from another client, it typically transforms the changes before executing them; the transformation ensures that application-dependent consistency criteria (invariants) are maintained by <b>all</b> <b>sites.</b> This mode of operation results in a system particularly suited for implementing collaboration features, like simultaneous document editing, in a high-latency environment such as the web.|$|E
25|$|As long {{as these}} two {{criteria}} are satisfied, the data replicas converge (with additional constraints) after all operations are executed at <b>all</b> <b>sites.</b> There {{is no need}} to enforce a total order of execution for the sake of achieving convergence. Their approach is generally to first identify and prove sufficient conditions for a few transformation functions, and then design a control procedure to ensure those sufficient conditions. This way the control procedure and transformation functions work synergistically to achieve correctness, i.e., causality and admissibility preservation. In their approach, there {{is no need to}} satisfy transformation properties such as TP2 because it does not require that the (inclusive) transformation functions work in all possible cases.|$|E
