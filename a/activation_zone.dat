40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to propose a {{constrained}} lexical semantic definition of referential metonymy within a model of meaning as ontology and construal. Due to their various types of lexical-referential pairings, 3 types of construals that are frequently referred to as metonymy in the cognitive literature are distinguished as metonymization, facetization, and <b>zone</b> <b>activation.</b> Metonymization involves the use of a lexical item to evoke the sense of something that is not conventionally linked to that particular lexical item. It is argued that metonymy is a contingent relation that stops at the sense level. Facetization and <b>zone</b> <b>activation</b> both involve the use of conventional pairings of lexical items and contextual readings.

2500|$|Gutiérrez lost 15th {{position}} when Vettel overtook {{him on the}} sixth lap. Vergne, Maldonado, Button and Gutiérrez were placed {{under investigation by the}} stewards for speeding behind the safety car on the following lap. The two Mercedes cars were running close behind each other with Hamilton remaining behind to conserve fuel, and observe the comparison between himself and Rosberg. The tight confines of the middle sector meant Hamilton had difficulty getting into the DRS <b>activation</b> <b>zone</b> before turn 11 and his left-front brake was [...] cooler because of him running behind the safety car. The driver braked heavily for certain corners to prevent glazing. Grosjean steered onto the outside line in an attempt to overtake Vergne for ninth place on the tenth lap but the latter drove defensively to keep the position. It was announced on the following lap that no further action was taken against Button although Vergne, Gutiérrez and Maldonado were handed five-second stop-and-go penalties which were served at their next pit stops. Ricciardo ran closely behind Bottas but did not have the straightline speed to affect an overtaking manoeuvre. On lap 12, Rosberg told his team over the radio that his front-left tyre was heavily worn.Red Bull elected to bring Ricciardo in for his pit stop to change onto medium compound tyres on lap 14 and the Williams team did the same for Massa. The pit stop left Bottas vulnerable to being undercut by Ricciardo and his pace on the lap enabled the latter to draw alongside Massa heading towards the first turn after his pit stop. Bottas gained momentum to pass Ricciarddo around the outside for fourth place. Rosberg made his pit stop from the lead on lap 15 and emerged behind teammate Hamilton in second. Bottas used DRS to attack Ricciardo entering turn 12 but the latter defended his position and did the same three corners later. Hamilton was slower than Rosberg and made his pit stop (lap 17) which saw a front wing adjustment and rejoined with a larger gap to his teammate but was now lapping faster. Ricciardo continued to fend off the faster Bottas who got close to Ricciardo heading into turn 12. Hülkenberg lost power in his engine and was his team instructed him to stop the car and drove {{to the side of the}} track on the backstraight to retire on lap 18. Alonso overtook Vettel to move into ninth position on the following lap. Gutiérrez left space for Grosjean who braked later than him and passed him for 12th place at turn 12 with Vergne following through.|$|E
50|$|Two drag {{reduction}} system (DRS) zones were introduced for the race.

5|$|The FIA {{approved}} {{minor changes}} to the layout of the Marina Bay Street Circuit ahead of the Grand Prix. The modifications ran from turn 11 to turn 13; drivers still turned right at turn 11 but it now kinked left slightly on entry, with the track shifting to the left-hand side of Fullerton Road. This changed the profile of turn 12, as drivers now used {{the other side of the}} Anderson Bridge, while the hairpin at turn 13 has been widened by a metre in order to increase overtaking opportunities. The drag reduction system (DRS) had two <b>activation</b> <b>zones</b> for the race; the first between turns five and seven down the length of Raffles Boulevard, and the second on the start/finish straight between turn 23 to turn one.|$|R
5000|$|The drag {{reduction}} system (DRS) had two <b>activation</b> <b>zones</b> for the race; one {{was on the}} straight between turns 3 and 4, and the second was on the start/finish straight from the final to first corners. The sport's sole tyre supplier Pirelli, provided two specifications of slick compound tyres for the race, designated Medium (also {{referred to as the}} [...] "prime" [...] tyre) and Soft (also referred to as the [...] "option" [...] tyre). The Medium compound was distinguished by a white-band with the Soft compound being distinguished by a yellow-band. As was the case for all the 2013 Grands Prix, the rules stipulated that all cars should use both types of tyre {{during the course of the}} race, and each driver was limited to eleven sets of dry tyres for the weekend.|$|R
50|$|In Formula One, the DRS opens an {{adjustable}} flap {{on the rear}} wing {{of the car to}} reduce drag, thus giving a pursuing car more speed and thus a greater chance of overtaking a car in front. The FIA estimate the speed increase to be between 10-12 km/h {{by the end of the}} <b>activation</b> <b>zone.</b> When the flap is closed it increases downforce, giving better cornering.|$|E
50|$|After {{experimenting with}} two drag {{reduction}} system (DRS) zones {{with a single}} detection point in 2011, the FIA decided that the 2012 race would use a single, longer DRS zone, mirroring the approach used in Canada. The detection point was positioned on the approach to Turn 8, with the activation point located between Turn 10 and Turn 11, and was brought forward 70 m from {{its position in the}} 2011 race, allowing drivers to activate the system sooner. The second DRS <b>activation</b> <b>zone,</b> located after Turn 14 in 2011, was removed for the 2012 race.|$|E
50|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} the , FIA race {{director}} Charlie Whiting announced that the Canadian Grand Prix would see the introduction of a secondary drag reduction system (DRS) <b>activation</b> <b>zone.</b> The plan for a secondary DRS zone would be continued at the European Grand Prix, with the first zone incorporating the long back straight on the approach to Turn 12, and the second zone using the stretch from Turns 14 to 17. Future use of a second DRS zone would depend on its success in Montreal and Valencia.|$|E

50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the DRS will vary from track to track and, to a lesser extent, from car to car. The system's effectiveness was reviewed in 2011 to see if overtaking could be made easier, {{but not to the}} extent that driver skill is sidelined. The {{effectiveness of}} DRS seems likely to be determined by the level of downforce at a given circuit (where the cars are in low drag trim at circuits like Monza, the effects may be smaller), by the length of the <b>activation</b> <b>zone,</b> and by the characteristics of the track immediately after the DRS zone.|$|E
50|$|Like the Canadian, European, Italian races {{earlier in}} the year, two DRS (Drag Reduction System) Zones were {{implemented}} in the inaugural Indian race. The detection point for the first DRS zone was located at the exit of turn 15 (10m after), while the DRS activation point was 36m after the final turn (turn 16). This meant that the start/finish straight would be utilised for one DRS overtaking zone. The second DRS zone had the activation point 16m before the turn 3 hairpin while the DRS <b>activation</b> <b>zone</b> was 510m after turn 3 which is about halfway down the back straight prior to turn 4.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the drivers}} were {{initially}} concerned that the Drag Reduction System (DRS) {{would prove to be}} unsafe on the narrow streets of the principality, and so lobbied to have the device banned {{for the duration of the}} weekend. Some elements of the paddock, including Williams objected to the ban, and use of the device was retained, with the DRS <b>activation</b> <b>zone</b> encompassing the front straight of the circuit, prompting Lewis Hamilton to comment that he did not think the 300 m of space allowed for the DRS would promote much overtaking. Following increased pressure from the drivers and FOTA, the FIA agreed to ban the use of the DRS in the tunnel for free practice and qualifying.|$|E
