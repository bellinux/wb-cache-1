50|$|Built in {{a former}} soundstage, The Screen has stadium seating, a 16-speaker Dolby Digital {{surround}} sound system, and 35-mm and digital projection on a high-definition curved screen approximately {{half the size of}} an IMAX screen. The Screen also utilizes analog sound readers, maximizing the ability to play mono and surround EX prints, and operates simplex changeover projectors with <b>adjustable</b> <b>shutter</b> capabilities to play silent film prints. A satellite receiver is also used to display live operas, plays, and ballets.|$|E
50|$|The iris is a {{metal frame}} housing {{designed}} with an <b>adjustable</b> <b>shutter</b> assembly (an iris). The iris is placed inside fixtures through a specifically designed opening, the accessory (or iris) slot. The iris is placed inside focal plane of fixture, before the lens assembly. An iris {{is designed to}} reduce diameter of beam emitted from fixture. The iris assembly {{is different from the}} donut as it adjusts the diameter of the beam, not the amount of off-axis light emitted.|$|E

50|$|The Helepolis bore a fearsome {{complement}} of heavy armaments, with two 180-pound (82 kg) catapults, and one 60-pounder (27 kg) (classified {{by the weight}} of the projectiles they threw) on the first floor, three 60-pounders (27 kg) on the second, and two 30-pounders (14 kg) on each of the next five floors. Apertures, shielded by mechanically <b>adjustable</b> <b>shutters,</b> lined with skins stuffed with wool and seaweed to render them fireproof, perforated the forward wall of the tower for firing the missile weapons. On each of the top two floors, soldiers could use two light dart throwers to easily clear the walls of defenders.|$|R
40|$|The Bachelor Thesis {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} {{existing}} uncontrolled weir on the river Svitava in "Cacovice island" locality and with the design of a new gate weir structure. The first part focuses on the processing of data on the area of interest and the selection of appropriate design solution for the reconstruction of the weir, where there are described several types of <b>adjustable</b> <b>shutters.</b> At the end of this part the current condition of the buildings and the bed of the Svitava river in the area of interest is evaluated. In the second part, the Thesis {{deals with the}} design of the gate weir structure and its subsequent assessment. At first, the solid substructure and the height of the shutter is designed and assessed. Subsequently, the stilling basin is designed and in conclusion, the overall stability of the designed structure is assessed...|$|R
5000|$|PureView Pro is an imaging {{technology}} {{used in the}} Nokia 1020 device. It is {{the combination of a}} 1/1.5" [...] large, high resolution 41 mpx image sensor with high performance Carl Zeiss optics. The large sensor enables pixel oversampling, which means the combination of many sensor pixels into one image pixel. PureView {{imaging technology}} delivers high image quality, lossless zoom, and improved low light performance (see below). It dispenses with the usual scaling/interpolation model of digital zoom used in virtually all smartphones. In both video and stills, this technique provides greater zoom levels as the output picture size reduces, enabling 4× lossless zoom in full HD 1080p video, 6× lossless zoom for 720p HD. Optical image stabilization is also present to nullify shaking of hands when taking a photo and to allow significantly more light to enter the sensor for better low light photos. It also has an <b>adjustable</b> <b>shutter</b> speed of up to 1/16,000 s.|$|E
5000|$|Starks {{claimed that}} Nishika {{also made a}} 3 lens camera, {{but there is no}} {{evidence}} that such a camera ever existed outside his article. It is interesting that some of the Nishika [...] "dealers" [...] claimed that the Nimslo had only 3 lenses. The confusion on the part of Michael Starks may stem from the introduction about a year later of the 3 lens Trilogy, which sported a built in electronic flash and motorized film advance, and was originally marketed through a system very similar to the multilevel scheme used by Nishika. The same camera was later renamed to Image Tech 3D 1000 and marketed through more traditional channels. Several other three-lens cameras were released, such as the 3D wizard, 3D magic, 3DFX, and Kalimar, some of which sported more modern features such as built-in electronic flash and motorized film advance, but lacked the auto-exposure features of the Nimslo. The 3D trio featured 3 element coated glass lenses, built in flash, motorized film advance, automatic exposure control, compatibility with DX coded ASA 100, 200 and 400 film, and a built in protective lens cover, making it the closest three-lens equivalent to the Nimslo. These 3 lens cameras gave more pictures per roll of film, 16 [...] for 24 exposure roll rather than the 12 yielded by Nimslo/Nishika and had less ghosting, but also less depth. There were other 4 lens Nimslo clones as well, such as the 3DNext and the Rittai. Like the Nishika, several of these were marketed through multilevel schemes, often in Asian countries, occasionally being the basis of a scam. In 2005 the Canadian firm Snap 3D began selling several 2 lens and 5 lens lenticular cameras made by US technology Ltd in Hong Kong. The 5 lens cameras were particularly odd producing five images that were 29.94 mm high and from 24.75 to 26.33 mm wide, all five images having a different width. These were deluxe cameras, featuring glass lenses, adjustable focus with rangefinder, <b>adjustable</b> <b>shutter</b> speeds 1/125, 1/60, 1/30 sec. and [...] "B", continuously adjustable aperture from f/5.6 to f22 and a spirit level. They also had automatic film loading and motorized film advance. Indeed, these cameras were so far removed from the Nimslo, that it might be stretching things to call them Nimslo clones. Snap 3D no longer sells these cameras and as of May 2012 no longer does lenticular printing due to failure of their machine.|$|E
40|$|In this study, a 40 × 48 pixel global shutter {{complementary}} metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) {{image sensor}} with an <b>adjustable</b> <b>shutter</b> time {{as low as}} 75 ps was implemented using a 0. 5 -μm mixed-signal CMOS process. The implementation consisted of a continuous contact ring around each p+/n-well photodiode in the pixel array in order to apply sufficient light shielding. The parasitic light sensitivity of the in-pixel storage node {{was measured to be}} 1 / 8. 5 × 107 when illuminated by a 405 -nm diode laser and 1 / 1. 4 × 104 when illuminated by a 650 -nm diode laser. The pixel pitch was 24 μm, the size of the square p+/n-well photodiode in each pixel was 7 μm per side, the measured random readout noise was 217 e− rms, and the measured dynamic range of the pixel of the designed chip was 5500 : 1. The type of gated CMOS image sensor (CIS) that is proposed here can be used in ultra-fast framing cameras to observe non-repeatable fast-evolving phenomena...|$|E
2500|$|Early {{vehicles}} had a pintle mount, {{just behind}} the front seats, that mounted a [...]50-caliber (12.7mm) M2 Browning machine gun. The later M3A1 adopted a raised, armored 'pulpit mount' for the [...]50-caliber, and [...]30-caliber (7.62mm) machine guns could be used from mounts {{along the sides of}} the passenger compartment. Many M3s were later modified to the M3A1 standard. The body was armored all around, with an <b>adjustable</b> armored <b>shutter</b> for the engine's radiator and a bulletproof windscreen.|$|R
