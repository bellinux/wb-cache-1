5|$|On 3 August the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt {{instructed}} Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) {{to examine}} Global Radio's purchase of GMG, which gave Global over 50% of the UK radio market {{because of concerns}} the takeover {{may not be in}} the public interest. On 11 October, the OFT agreed to fast-track the investigation. Hunt's successor Maria Miller said the deal would not be investigated for media plurality. The OFT concluded that the merger could lead to a rise in local <b>advertising</b> <b>costs</b> because of the decrease in competitors, and forwarded the matter to the Competition Commission, which oversees business mergers and takeovers. On the same day the Competition Commission announced it would publish its findings into the takeover by 27 March 2013.|$|E
5|$|A similar issue again {{arose in}} 2009 when Burger King {{diverted}} {{several million dollars}} of advertising rebates paid to its American franchises by Coca Cola Corporation and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group to its own coffers. The company intended to utilize these funds to increase its advertising presence in the United States {{at a time when}} corporate <b>advertising</b> <b>costs</b> were falling, which would allow an increased media presence of approximately 25% from the previous year (2008). The NFA contended that Burger King Corporation improperly redirected 40% of restaurant operating funds (ROF) paid by the two beverage suppliers to franchises since 1990 into the corporate advertising budget. These funds were often used by the franchises to pay for beverage support systems such as filtration units and local marketing, and diversion of the funds would cost franchises at least $65 million (USD) between 2010-2012. These funds often helped the franchises' bottom lines, as they were often used to offset other costs imposed on the franchises by Burger King, such as the $1 (USD) Double Cheeseburger.|$|E

It focused on the classification of <b>advertising</b> <b>cost</b> for tax purposes. Research questions posed by this study are answered {{through the development of}} a classification process that may assist with the classification of <b>advertising</b> <b>cost</b> for the purpose of taxation. It has been established that guidelines for the classification of <b>advertising</b> <b>cost</b> as capital or revenue of nature are needed to correctly classify <b>advertising</b> <b>cost</b> for tax purposes. Furthermore, the determination of when <b>advertising</b> <b>cost</b> will be regarded as capital of nature is required. The study used a mixed method research approach, involving a literature review of case law and income tax acts as well as an analysis of annual financial statements. Findings from this research indicate a growing trend in revenue generated from advertising in South Africa; proving the importance of the advertising market in the economy. Guidelines for the classification of <b>advertising</b> <b>cost</b> for tax purposes were established by using principles from national and international case law. Master...|$|R

2500|$|Thousands {{of breast}} cancer-themed {{products}} are developed and sold each year. Some {{of these items}} are everyday products that have been repackaged or repositioned {{to take advantage of}} cause-related marketing, such as teddy bears, clothing, jewelry, candles, and coffee mugs. These blended value objects offer consumers an opportunity to simultaneously buy an object and make a donation to a breast cancer organization. Some of these products are produced and/or sold by breast cancer survivors or charities for fundraising purposes, while others are for profits in addition to fundraising. Manufacturers also produce products with pink labels or pink ribbon logos to donate a sum of money to support the cause. The donation is typically capped so that it is reached after a fixed level of sales, although in some cases the company is providing only free advertising for a selected charity. Although <b>advertising</b> <b>costs</b> are rarely disclosed, some companies have been found to spend far more money advertising [...] "pink products" [...] and tie-ins than they donate to charitable organizations supporting research or patients. For example, in 2005, 3M spent US $500,000 advertising post-it notes printed with a pink ribbon logo. Sales were nearly double what the company expected, but the campaign resulted in a $300,000 donation.|$|E
2500|$|With a {{production}} budget of $306 million, plus $175 million for marketing, printing and <b>advertising</b> <b>costs,</b> The Force Awakens was predicted to {{be a major}} box office success. The cost of the film was subsidized by £31.6 million ($47 million USD) from the UK film incentive program. Total costs, after accounting for profit participations, production and distribution of home videos, as well as other ancillary mediums, is expected to run $423 million. Reports in April 2015 from The Hollywood Reporter and Amboee Brand Intelligence predicted the film would earn up to $540 million worldwide for its opening, breaking the record for the biggest worldwide opening, as well as breaking the record for the biggest U.S. opening. They also believed that The Force Awakens would have the widest release ever, across 4,500 theaters in North America. Instead, it received a total of 4,134 theaters, and had the widest December opening. Box office analyst Phil Contrino likened the film to Avatar (2009), which opened to $77 million in North America and went on to earn $2.8 billion worldwide, saying The Force Awakens would earn $1 billion [...] "without blinking" [...] and could gross $2 billion. In August 2015, Deadline.com predicted an opening weekend of $615 million worldwide could be possible, including a $300 million opening in North America. In November, box office analysts reported opening weekend projections were at $175–250 million. In December, capital analyst Barton Crockett suggested that the film {{will be the first to}} gross over $3 billion worldwide at the box office.|$|E

40|$|This paper endogenizes both market {{transparency}} and product differentiation {{in a model}} of informative advertising Ã¡ la Grossman and Shapiro (1984). We find, contrary to Schultz (2004), that an increase in {{market transparency}} raises firm profits but {{has no effect on}} product differentiation. We also find that a move from exogenous to endogenous market transparency is detrimental to welfare. Compared to the Grossman and Shapiro model, with endogenous product differentiation, firms advertise more, differentiate their products more, charge higher prices and earn higher profits when the <b>advertising</b> <b>cost</b> is "not too low". This is because endogenizing product differentiation relaxes price competition when the <b>advertising</b> <b>cost</b> is not too low.
