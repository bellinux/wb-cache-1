5|$|The {{studbook}} for the Poitevin {{horse was}} created by the Société Centrale d'Agriculture des Deux-Sèvres on June 26, 1884, with a horse section and a donkey section. The first edition was released December 31, 1885, setting the physical criteria for the breeding and ending the practice of promoting crossbred horses as purebreds. It also marked the end of government intervention against the mule breeding industry, although bonuses were paid to encourage farmers to breed purebred horses. In 1902, a breeding syndicate to promote Poitou mules was created, but disappeared after a lack of advertising by stock breeders. On August 6, 1912, the French government released a decree officially supporting the mule breeding industry, backed by the purchase of mules by the French National Stud <b>and</b> <b>bonuses</b> given to the best stallions.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} play in the Lancashire League in England during the Australian winter of 1952, joining Nelson Cricket Club for a sum of 600 pounds <b>and</b> <b>bonuses,</b> which did not include the boat fares for him and his wife. Lindwall took 96 wickets at 8.37 during the season and developed an inswinger on the advice of a local umpire who adamantly refused to give leg before wicket decisions to outswingers. Lindwall returned to Australia with a newborn son who has been born during his stay in Lancashire, and he was greeted by media speculation as to whether his professional sojourn had improved or detracted from his capabilities. Lindwall's form leading into the Tests against South Africa in 1952–53 prompted observers to opine that he was bowling better than ever, reinforced with the inswinger and his trademark Yorker. Lindwall made 70 from a total of 148 on a sticky wicket against South Australia in Adelaide that led Miller to regard it as the best innings he had seen under such conditions. He made the score after being sent in to open the batting in the absence of Sid Barnes.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{corporate}} governance factors on the firm performance and executive compensation linkage. Specifically, we examine how domestic corporate-appointed directors, bank-appointed directors and foreign ownership moderate the relationship between firm profitability, sales growth, <b>and</b> executive <b>bonus</b> pay in Japanese firms. Using {{a sample of the}} largest Japanese manufacturing companies from 1997 to 2007, we find that corporate-appointed directors positively moderate the relationship between firm growth <b>and</b> <b>bonus</b> pay, while foreign shareholders exhibit a positive moderating effect on the relationship between firm profitability <b>and</b> <b>bonus</b> pay. Bank-appointed directors are straddled between their profitability orientation and relational role: They link firm profitability <b>and</b> <b>bonus</b> pay, but also show positive influence on the firm growth <b>and</b> <b>bonus</b> pay relationship. Our findings offer insights to stakeholders to pay attention to ownership structure and board composition in acknowledging the varied financial motivation of executives to pursue growth and/or profitability...|$|R
