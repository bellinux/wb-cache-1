The Former Republic of Yugoslavia has become a theater of atrocious confrontations between people with common history and traditions. The wars in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, two components of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia, have entailed the involvement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the multinational efforts to stop violence in this region. Since 1990, NATO's new objectives are reducing the risk of conflict, building increased mutual understanding and confidence among all European states, helping to manage crises affecting the security of the Allies, and expanding the opportunities for a genuine partnership among all European countries in dealing with common security problems.

Several mechanism for this type of electronic dispute resolution are available, namely cyber-negotiation, cyber-mediation and cyber-arbitration. The first can be classified as either assisted, which employs technologies for the purposes of communication, agenda development and adoption of solutions, or automated, where specialized software acts as a negotiator between the parties.

40|$|DARWIN’s (1859, 1871) discoveries have {{profound}} ethical implications {{that continue to}} be misrepresented and/or ignored. In contrast to socialdarwinistic misuses of his theory, Darwin was a great humanitarian who {{paved the way for}} an integrated scientific and ethical world view. As an ethical doctrine, socialdarwinism is long dead ever since its defeat by E. G. Moore although the socialdarwinistic thought is a hard-die in the biological community. The accusations of sociobiology for being socialdarwinistic are unfounded and stem from the moralistic fallacy that is, a false assumption that morality is good by definition. 	Both social and developmental psychology demonstrate that the moral agency is a motivational device for executing reciprocity that remains at the core of any morality across all studied societies and throughout the ontogeny of moral judgment. The level of true universalizing ethical reflection (KOHLBERG’s postconvential stages or GIBBS’s existential phase) is achieved by a small minority of humans, thus showing that Homo sapiens is a moral but not an ethical animal. While the origin of reciprocity has been perfectly explained by sociobiology, the evolutionary assembly of affective and cognitive elements that make up the moral agency is being successfully studied by the social/personality/developmental psychology as extended to non-human primates. As DARWIN (1871) expected, the key innovation for the evolution of moral agency was the emergence of empathy that evolved independently at least three times: in elephants, dolphins and primates. Empathy has a motivational power of its own; it is also necessary for moral agency that requires two cognitive abilities: reflective self-consciousness and understanding of causality; the two make possible the attribution of responsibility. All these requirements are met by the chimpanzees whose moral agency operates in dyads. In contrast, the human moral agency allows for <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>intervention</b> that opens up vast opportunities for ideologies, especially religions, to use and misuse the moral agency to enforce a reciprocation that may be harmful to both individuals and the entire group. Also, the moral agency is known to enforce enhanced intragroup cohesion and loyalty in response to conflict and war, which suggests that the two prima facie opposed human universals, morality and warfare, may have coevolved. The most important ethical consequence that follows from the increasing understanding of the primate moral agency is that every received morality is ethically flawed, none can be taken as a paragon of goodness, and each needs corrections by science-informed ethics. In fact, Darwin pioneered the integration of science and ethics, an approach that has come to be appreciated only recently under the heading of consilience...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Pastoral)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The central {{theoretical}} {{argument of}} this study is that biblical mediation may be a useful short-term method for use in pastoral care, specifically within the bounds of reconciliation in troubled marriages. The goal of formulating a basis theory was to explore what the Biblical teaching is on marriage, marital conflict, mediation and reconciliation. In general, a revelation-historical approach was followed. Specific cases of marital conflict in the Bible were examined. In researching reconciliation the role of Jesus Christ and pastors as mediator was explored. A grammatical-historical exegesis was done on Mat. 59, Mat. 18 : 15 - 17 and Rom. 14 : 19. It was concluded that marriage is a union of companionship based on a covenant and ordained by God and foreshadowing the eternal joyous relationship between Christ and the Church. God hates divorce, which is permitted only in certain circumstances. It was found that biblical teaching on conflict in general may be applied to marital conflict. It was concluded that although not all conflict is caused by sin, sinful attitudes and behaviours, including sinful desires or legitimate desires elevated to demands and distortion of the husband - wife roles designed by God before the Fall, do play a part in causing conflict. With regard to reconciliation it was concluded that Jesus acted as Mediator on the cross, making possible reconciliation between God and man, which also reflects God's will for the horizontal relationship between his people, particularly in marriage. Several examples of informal mediations and of calls to peacemaking were found in the Bible. It was found that Mat. 185 - 17 allows for mediation or counselling by one or two others in the church in certain circumstances. For establishing a meta theory the goal was to examine biblical mediation as <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>intervention</b> in pastoral care for reconciliation in troubled marriages. A literature study was conducted on mediation, biblical mediation as taught by Peacemaker Ministries and on marital conflict and intervention methods resembling mediation by a survey of the literature in the social sciences. A qualitative empirical study was conducted, by doing biblical mediation with three Christian couples. It was concluded that mediation, and particularly the biblical mediation model used by Peacemaker Ministries, may be used to advantage by pastors for reconciliation in troubled marriages. The aim of establishing 'a practice theory was to propose a biblical mediation model to guide pastors in working toward reconciliation in troubled marriages. This was done by an analysis and synthesis of the basis - and meta theory in hermeneutical interaction. Master...|$|E
40|$|The {{flexibility}} of long-term investment contracts is {{a benefit to}} both an investor and the state for mitigating the effect of an unforeseeable event which negatively impacts on {{the viability of the}} contract. However, the aspect of sanctity of contract has often prompted rigid provisions with the underlying rationale that this gives investors security and predictability. In contrast, by virtue of the principle of fundamental change of circumstances, new trend has come to life in the field of extractive industries consisting of inclusion in the contract a provision that provides for renegotiation or adaptation of the existing agreement. The reasoning behind the adoption technique is that parties should not be obliged to carry on a performance which would be unjustly onerous or fruitless due to a supervening unregulated event. The main criticism of this approach is that the claim for renegotiating an existing agreement which contains no renegotiation clause or insistence on <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>intervention</b> for adapting such a contract amount to an undue interference. However, the manner in which contracts are negotiated in countries that exhibit poor governance or situation of army conflict challenges this view. The question asked is whether an unfair contract concluded with unelected government or leaders of military factions and subject to corruption can be allowed to survive without being revised. The DRC, realizing this problem, undertook to renegotiate some of its mining contracts with specific objectives, such as; investor respect of legislation, use of local resources, social responsibility clauses, and evaluation of the input of the partners taking into account the equity shareholding with the public party holding not less than 51 %. This has resulted in the termination and cancellation of certain contracts. Aggrieved investors filed several proceedings, but they dropped them, privileging an amicable settlement. Besides, the outcome of the renegotiation suggests that Congolese negotiators have not fully achieved the objectives set out {{at the start of the}} process. Against this backdrop, the dissertation found that the Congolese mining sector is governed by a broad range of regulations and corresponding supervisory bodies. Constant suspicions of illegally mining exploitation prevail on the sector as a result of the ill enforcement of the aforesaid regulations, corruption and mismanagement. This study also found that renegotiating an existing agreement is a common practice in commercial contracts. Major systems of law have dealt with when they confronted with the issue related to the non-performance of a contractual obligation. The stability of the contractual terms is must but, at the same time, a certain degree of flexibility is necessary to allow parties to adjust their relationship in case of imperfections, cultural differences or supervening of unforeseen events. However, to be effective, the renegotiation mechanism must be regulated for not fuelling unlimited demand of adaptation, therefore, instability of the contract. The renegotiation of mining contacts in DRC was extremely politicised. However, both investor and Congolese sides have benefited from that differently. The Congolese government gave preference to short-term profits result to the expenses of the long-term improvements. By comparison, the majority of investors have secured their assets. Others have even increased them. An examination of the amended agreement that have been disclosed so far reveals that a lot issues remain unresolved, particularly with regard to the reasons that prompted the renegotiation. Moreover, parties to the aforesaid process did not attempt to regulate future demands of adaptation. Based on these findings, the recommendation of the dissertation is that future mining agreements should include a renegotiation clause and regulate the intervention of a third party. The Congolese government should endeavour to lessen political interference throughout mining contract negotiations. It should also build negotiation skills among its representatives involved in that process. Investors should increase among them awareness of corporate social responsibility standards for preventing illegal exploitation of mining resources which, ultimately, results in triggering unilateral contract adjustment. The remaining issues in connection with the amended agreements should be resolved amicably for this approach is more likely to bring mutual satisfaction to both the Congolese state and investors.

There is a paucity of evidence to indicate those who access web-based personalised feedback interventions respond in a way consistent with hypothesised active ingredients. This research uses the think-aloud technique to explore how students respond to instant web-based personalised normative feedback. Methods: Between-subjects experimental design employing qualitative methods. Twenty-one UK university students generated think-aloud transcripts while completing a web-based intervention (Unitcheck). This {{was followed by a}} semi-structured interview. One coding frame was developed to classify all utterances. Results: Narrative synthesis revealed five meta-themes: active thinking about alcohol use; comparisons with others; beliefs and knowledge about alcohol consumption; inter-relationship between personal codes and context; and engagement with Unitcheck. Conclusions: Students willingly engaged with the online assessment and personalised feedback. Students consciously engaged with the intervention and this engagement prompted students to actively consider their own behaviour, knowledge, perceptions, and to reflect on future behaviour. The ability of web-based personalised feedback interventions to effect change in individual’s behaviours is likely related to their ability to encourage cognitive engagement and active processing of the information provided...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} phenomenon of joining behavior [...] non-neutral <b>interventions</b> by <b>third</b> <b>party</b> states in interstate conflicts. The opportunity and willingness theoretical framework (Most and Starr 1989) is used to develop <b>a</b> model of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>intervention</b> that integrates simultaneously intervention decision, alignment choices, and selection of specific intervention techniques. Within the general model of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>intervention,</b> two models of <b>third</b> <b>party's</b> preference formation [...] a rational choice and a homophily-based model [...] are compared. The models are empirically tested with newly collected data on interventions in interstate disputes for the 1946 - 2001 period.

Opportunity factors are found to predict effectively third parties' intervention; while willingness shapes alignment decisions and selection of intervention techniques.

In the first chapter, the general protection extended to <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> is considered from the viewpoint of the general principle of the relative effect of judicial decisions, their value as building blocks of the Court's jurisprudence and their role as a subsidiary legal source. The second and third chapters are devoted to a critical analysis of the nature, scope, effect and conditions for the operation of the specific <b>third</b> <b>party</b> guarantees, namely, <b>intervention</b> for the purpose of the protection of the interest of <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> and <b>intervention</b> when the construction of a convention is in issue in a pending case. The fourth chapter examines the position of <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> in relation to the Court's advisory jurisdiction by considering the nature and effect of advisory opinions, by defining and identifying "third parties" in the context of the advisory procedure, by assessing the nature and extent of their participation in advisory proceedings and by undertaking a brief empirical survey of the impact of advisory opinions on them.

40|$|Master of EducationThis {{research}} project {{sets out to}} explore the nature of children's conflicts. This qualitative study investigates the students' and teachers' perceptions of conflict; and examines {{the extent to which}} children's and teachers' perceptions affect the management of conflict. The conflictive interactions of six year 4 primary students (3 males, 3 females) and six full time classroom teachers (5 females, 1 male) were recorded. In all, 60 observations were made of the sample, over a 5 month period. Individual semi-structured interviews exploring conflict perceptions, experiences and conflict management strategies were held with the student and teacher respondents. In this study conflict is defined broadly to include disagreements, verbal disputes, emotional quarrels and physical fights. This study has demonstrated that the children and teachers perceived conflicts as negative, physical acts, and it suggests that their perceptions affected the way in which conflicts were managed. The findings indicate that conflict between children regularly occurred. Both students and teachers relied on familiar strategies that incorporated calling in <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> (teacher <b>intervention),</b> contending, withdrawal and smoothing. Overall, the students demonstrated contending (the use of aggressive verbal and physical tactics) as the preferred conflict management strategy. Even though students and teachers used a variety of conflict management strategies the findings reveal that conflicts recurred and many conflicts were left unresolved. The teacher respondents recognised collaborative problem solving as an effective means of conflict resolution. However, the findings give evidence that teachers initiated intervention between the disputing students to stop the disruptive behaviour and took the onus of resolving the conflicts off the students by using authoritarian tactics to manage student conflicts. Key themes which emerge from the findings of this {{research project}} most and which are explored in greater depth are: the definition of conflict {{within the context of the}} school; the affect and range of conflict management strategies used by students and teachers; the relationship between perception and management; and the role of the teacher in conflict management.

Such trends are exacerbated in regions of social deprivation yet little is known on how best to intervene in this male population. The objectives of this study were to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a purpose-built active video game (AVG) intervention in a target population of sedentary males from a region of lower socio-economic status. Methods: This was a community-based pilot randomised controlled exploratory trial. We recruited men (n = 47) from areas of social deprivation in the North East of England in distinct community settings; a working men’s club (n = 6), taxi ranks (n = 22), mosque (n = 17) and home visits (n = 2). Following baseline measures of metabolic health and quality of life, participants were randomly allocated by <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> to <b>an</b> <b>intervention</b> (n = 27) or control (n = 17) group.

Outcome measures included metabolic risk factors and quality of life measures at baseline (0 weeks) and follow-up (13 weeks). Results: Both the intervention and research procedures were feasible and acceptable to participants.

40|$|Computer {{supported}} facilitation is <b>a</b> form of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>intervention</b> {{that uses}} advanced information technology to deliver non-authoritative intervention on organizational decision making. The {{goal of this}} type of intervention is to create communication events where decision making and decision outcomes are collaboratively produced by those who have a stake in the decision. The facilitator's role is to assure decision making progress without taking sides or rendering a final decision. The obligations of facilitation form competing injunctions for practicing facilitation. Facilitative intervention must be performed so that it influences decision activity without influencing decision outcomes, facilitators must participate in decision making without becoming a party to the decision, and facilitators must enforce decision procedures without coercing participant acceptance of the procedures. The evolution of the field is marked by innovations in practice and role definitions that seek more effective means to reconcile the competing demands of the role and the changing circumstances of the intervention context. Computer supported facilitation is a technologically advanced form of intervention that combine skills of facilitators with the capacities of collaborative computing technology to more efficiently and effectively deliver decisions for organizations facing a choice. The facilitator designs and carries out interventions by using group decision support systems that enable anonymous participation, simultaneous communication of ideas, geographic and chronological distribution of participation, and the electronic storage of contributions. This investigation finds that while technical advances help facilitators overcome the numerous barriers to decision making communication, the advances in technique and technology are prescriptions for decision making communication built on inadequate descriptive assumptions about the nature of communication. The community of facilitation practice and its technologies operate on the dubious assumption that communication process and content are in fact distinct. The community of practice, however, is caught up in preserving this distinction as its solution to the paradoxes of doing non-authoritative intervention. The dissertation demonstrates this state of affairs by showing the set of premises for facilitative action embodied in the process management view of the practice, the methods of transparency work which uphold intervention neutrality, and the way the community treats an innovation on practice...|$|R

In this paper, we examine how contested water rights impede water trade. To show this, we use a model in which property rights to water are contested because countries have overlapping claims to water. In the model, countries decide whether to bargain over the allocation of contested river water or not. If not, they engage in conflict. In the conflict, countries spend their resources on production, which also requires water, or on fighting to secure part of the contested water. The resulting equilibrium is inefficient as both countries spend a positive amount of resources on fighting which is not productive. However, <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> may be requested {{to intervene in the}} looming conflict and allocate the water in an equitable way.

What kinds of rebel group interactions are facilitated by such <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>interventions?</b> Existing rebel group interaction patterns {{play a key role}} in determining conflict process and, influence <b>third</b> <b>party’s</b> decision to intervene. I predict that a cooperative interaction pattern between rebel groups generates an intervention enriched environment for the rebel groups, due to the increased likelihood of successful intervention and the decreased cost of war. The <b>third</b> <b>party’s</b> involvement in ongoing multiple party civil conflict generates a change in bargaining structure between rebels in terms of number of bargainers and distribution of capabilities. I predict a conditional effect of rebel biased interventions on inter rebel dynamics; while forceful intervention boosts cooperation between rebels, weak intervention fuels competition between them. To test my theoretical conjectures, the interlocking relationship between rebels’ interactions and rebel biased interventions has been empirically estimated on a large-N framework. The estimated results strongly confirm my theoretical predictions that rebel cooperation encourages rebel biased interventions and, that increased cooperation and competition is dependent upon <b>third</b> <b>party’s</b> commitment. Overall, my findings highlight a distinctive process of multiparty civil conflicts in terms of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>interventions</b> and rebel group dynamics. My first findings regarding rebel biased interventions, expand the existing intervention literature by focusing on rebel group dynamics in multiparty civil conflicts. The empirical evidence showing boosted competition and cooperation caused by intervention, can be linked to studies that discuss the correlation between interventions and conflict terminations.

Because of such ongoing relationships, a vital component {{of any kind of}} {{dispute resolution}} is how conflicting parties feel about each other after the process is over. Although previous conflict resolution research focuses primarily on the perceived fairness of the third-party, process or outcome, my dissertation centers around how the two parties engaged in the process perceive each other and their relations. Specifically, I ask how intermediaries' intervention in a resolution process affects disputing individuals' perceptions of fairness of one another, general positive regard toward one another, and predictions for positive future interactions with one another. I explore the relationship between <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>intervention</b> and such relationship outcomes using two experimental methods, vignettes and laboratory research. In each experiment I vary the level of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>intervention</b> (high, low, absent), while holding dispute resolution outcomes constant, and then measure disputants' perceptions of one another.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>intervention</b> in domestic political disputes has posed a significant dilemma for international relations scholars and practitioners for several decades. Specifically, why do <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> decide {{to intervene in}} some intrastate disputes, but decide not to intervene in other intrastate disputes? The question of why potential <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> choose to intervene in some cases but not in other cases has been widely discussed among international relations scholars and practitioners for several decades, but very few systematic analyses of the question have been conducted by international relations scholars. In this study, I intend {{to deal with some}} of the deficiencies in the international relations literature on <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>interventions</b> in intrastate disputes. After describing the {{phenomenon of}} <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>interventions</b> in intrastate disputes in the 20 th century, I develop hypotheses regarding the occurrence of state interventions and intergovernmental organization (IGO) interventions in domestic political disputes. Hypotheses are tested using originally-collected data on some 3, 102 cases of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>interventions</b> (including 1, 669 state/coalition of states interventions, 573 United Nations interventions, and 860 regional IGO interventions) in some 400 intrastate disputes during the 20 th century. Using Logit regression analysis, I find that a combination of strategic (international) linkages and nonstrategic (transnational) linkages had significant effects on the occurrence of state interventions during the 20 th century. I also find that a combination of security, political, humanitarian, and normative considerations had significant effects on the occurrence of UN and regional IGO interventions during the post-World War II period...|$|R

40|$|Moral hazard can {{be found}} almost in all fields of human activities. Moral hazard is a change of {{economic}} agentÂ´s behaviour when circumstances change. Theoretical background of moral hazard issue in economics dates back to 1970 s. Recognition of moral hazard started by published studies of Pauly (Pauly 1968), Zeckhauser (Zeckhauser 1970), Arrow (Arrow 1971) and Mirrlees (Mirrlees 1999). Current situation {{of the global economy}} (fall 2011) was caused largely by moral hazard executed by authorities such as governments, institutions, ranking agencies, banks, chief executive officers, politicians etc. Efforts to stabilise Eurozone, governments bail-outs to banks, governments purchases of toxic assets, rescue packages given to the bank sector and big companies, which are â€œtoo big to failâ€, rescue packages given to debtor nations, golden parachutes given to employees which are leaving companies are nothing but the manifestations of moral hazard in economic and politic reality. This paper uses an economic experiment with 96 subjects to examine the tendencies of economic agents towards moral hazard. Design of the experiment allowed simulating third partyâ€™s intervention on a market (e. g. state funding accelerating purchase, health care insurance function on the market with health care). Obtained data are statistically evaluated and it is shown, that economic agents incline to moral hazard in case, when it is possible. Study shows how rational agents became less rational in terms of average market price, after <b>intervention</b> of <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>party</b> on the market. <b>Third</b> <b>party</b> <b>intervention</b> raises the average market prices presenting a manifestation of moral hazard. It is shown, that under given assumptions, even rational economic agents diverge from rational and market efficient strategies and behave irresponsibly. Despite generally negative attitude towards moral hazard, it is shown that economic agents have tendencies to behave in such a manner. During experiment we observed robust deviation in equilibrium market price before and after the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>intervention...</b>|$|R
