40|$|The World Wide Web (WWW or Web) {{is growing}} rapidly on the Internet. Web users want fast {{response}} time and {{easy access to}} <b>a</b> <b>enormous</b> variety of information across the world. Thus, performance is becoming a main issue in the Web.

The Web is also a complex, irregular, and random system. In this paper, we look at the document reference pattern at Internet Web servers and use fractalbased models to understand aspects (e. g. caching schemes) that affect the Web performance. 1 Introduction The World Wide Web (WWW or Web) is growing rapidly on the Internet. Web users want fast response time and easy access to <b>a</b> <b>enormous</b> variety of information across the world. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the primary protocol used for sharing information [BLCL 94]. A Web server is a system on a network that can process HTTP re [...] ...|$|R
