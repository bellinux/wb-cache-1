40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to propose a similar framework developed by Lu, Zhao & Wang (2010) on the understanding of how trust in virtual community (thereafter VC) members and trust in vendors affect <b>actual</b> <b>purchasing</b> behaviour. The proposed research is to replicate part of the study carried out by Lu et al. (2010) and extend it within the context of Business to Consumer (thereafter B 2 C) environment for Small and Medium enterprises (thereafter SME) in China using China’s largest Consumer to Consumer (thereafter C 2 C) platform, TaoBao. Since trust is a signifying factor in transactions, the study only focuses on the impact of trust in virtual community members and trust in vendors on <b>actual</b> <b>purchase.</b> In this study, a positivist approach was adopted and quantitative method was used to test the proposed hypotheses. A questionnaire was adapted from Lu et al. (2010) and Barkhi, Belanger & Hicks (2008) for online survey. Prospective buyers of internet stores of TaoBao were invited to participate in the anonymous online survey. Non probability sampling method is used for collecting the data. Four hundred and twelve valid responses were collected for this study during the research period. The purpose is to find how the online buyers’ trust in virtual community members and trust in web vendor, affects <b>actual</b> <b>purchase</b> in a B 2 C environment in China. This will assist businesses to make better strategic planning approaches when launching products on the internet. Results of the study support the hypothesis that only trust in member’s ability positively affects trust in vendor’s ability and vendor’s benevolence for <b>actual</b> <b>purchase</b> group. The results also support the hypothesis that trust in member’s integrity and benevolence is positively related to trust in vendor’s ability for <b>actual</b> <b>purchase</b> group. Finding further shows that only vendor’s ability trusting dimension has the effect on <b>actual</b> <b>purchase</b> and it is inconclusive for vendor’s integrity and vendor’s benevolence dimension. In addition, there seems to be no relationship between member’s ability, member’s integrity and benevolence trusting dimension on <b>actual</b> <b>purchase.</b> Detail discussion of the results, managerial implication, contributions as well as limitations and the need for future studies are included in the final chapter...|$|R

50|$|As {{consumers}} {{move through}} the hierarchy of effects (awareness→ knowledge→ liking→ preference→ conviction→ purchase), they rely on different sources of information to learn about brands. While main media advertising is useful for creating awareness, its capacity to convey long or complex messages is limited.

As consumers move closer to the <b>actual</b> <b>purchase,</b> they begin to rely on more personal sources of information such as recommendations from friends and relatives or the advice of sales representatives. For example, the opinion of an influential blogger might be enough to shore up preference/conviction while a salesperson might be necessary to close the <b>actual</b> <b>purchase.</b>|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to examine how purchase intention can improve the prediction of <b>actual</b> <b>purchase</b> on an aggregated level. On macro level the adoption of products result in a product diffusion curve that can influence the relationship between <b>purchase</b> intention and <b>actual</b> <b>purchase.</b> According to former research on micro level, attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control are expected to influence purchase intention. Using an Australian database provided by Roy Morgan Research, this research formulated three hypotheses: H 1 : Purchase intention of a population at t- 1 is positively related to <b>actual</b> <b>purchase</b> at t. H 2 : Product diffusion positively moderates the relation between a consumer’s purchase intention at t- 1 and the <b>actual</b> <b>purchase</b> at t. H 3 : Purchase intention of a population is positively influenced by the consumer’s attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control. A sample that contains 22 entertainment products and purchase behaviour data of Australian households is used to test the expected relationships. The hypotheses are tested {{along the lines of the}} diffusion theory and the theory of planned behaviour. When a product enters the market, consumers adopt the product and the diffusion of the product starts. According to the widely used Bass model, the adoption of products occurs based on the imitation of precursor adopters. In other words, social pressure results in purchase of products. The Bass model is a S-shaped curve that displays the product adoption by consumers over time until a certain saturation point is reached. In this research, a difference is made between the first, A, and second, B part of this diffusion curve. This is tested by comparing results of the data in these two product diffusion parts. Furthermore, the theory of planned behaviour is used to approach purchase intention. This theory originates in the theory of reasoned action assuming that attitude and subjective norm influence the consumers’ intention. Later, research shows the added value of perceived behavioural control in understanding purchase intention. Therefore, all three variables are included in this research. The database of Roy Morgan Research contains factors that directly measure <b>purchase</b> intention, <b>actual</b> <b>purchase</b> and product diffusion. Attitude is measured by four statements regarding interest in technology that are derived from the dataset. Moreover, since product diffusion and subjective norm are both mainly based on social pressure, product diffusion is used to measure the influence of subjective norm on purchase intention. In addition, perceived behavioural control is measured by income and the ownership of complementary goods. All used data is a percentage of the total population that are transferred from the database to SPSS. Subsequently, ANCOVA models are used, because this test is able to include continuous variables, it enables to correct for the differences between the included entertainment products and it tests the relation between variables. All models that compare data in diffusion part A and B when compared to models analyzing all data, better explain the dependent variable based on the included independent variables. The result of interpreting the output of ANCOVA models is a confirmation of the first hypothesis regarding the main relation. Purchase intention positively affects <b>actual</b> <b>purchase,</b> as expected. The second hypothesis is not confirmed. With regard to the third hypothesis a significant positive relation was found between subjective norm and purchase intention. No significant relation was found between attitude or perceived behavioural control and purchase intention. Therefore, the third hypothesis concerning this relationship, except for the part concerning subjective norm, was rejected. In conclusion, subjective norm positively influences purchase intention and purchase intention is positively related to <b>actual</b> <b>purchase.</b> Firms can use this model to make predictions for innovations and more diffused products. First, when firms have developed several innovations and aim to determine which of these products will perform best on the market, the management team can use purchase intention to predict the future sales. Second, when a firm, for instance, lacks in having a precise sales history, purchase intention can be used to determine <b>actual</b> <b>purchase</b> of existing products as well. At least one year upfront a firm needs to survey consumers on the market about their purchase intention. Furthermore, the social network of consumers will influence the purchase intention and should be taken into account while measuring the purchase intention. In diffusion part A the <b>actual</b> <b>purchase</b> will be approximately the same population fraction as stated to have a purchase intention, while in part B the <b>actual</b> <b>purchase</b> will be approximately three times the measured purchase intention. To conclude, firms can base their future sales predictions on the purchase intention. After conducting this research, some recommendations regarding further research are formulated. First, more research on aggregated level can focus on the theory of planned behaviour, because in this research only subjective norm is significantly related to purchase intention, while also a relation was expected between both attitude and perceived behavioural control and purchase intention. Second, the hypotheses were tested with trend data, whereas panel data can provide more insights into the individual decisions. Third, further research can be done with other product categories and data obtained from more than one country to make it easier to generalize the results. Finally, future research can focus on the reason of purchase. Not enough data was available concerning replacement purchases, which can give a more complete view of the nature of the purchase intention and the reason for <b>actual</b> <b>purchase...</b>|$|R
