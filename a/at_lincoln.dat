5|$|Coutances {{was elected}} to the see of Lincoln on 8 May 1183, {{selected}} by King Henry over three other candidates. He was ordained a priest on 11 June 1183 and consecrated bishop on 3 July 1183 at Angers by Richard of Dover, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He was enthroned <b>at</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Cathedral on 11 December 1183. While <b>at</b> <b>Lincoln,</b> Coutances took part in the election of Baldwin of Forde as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, which took place at a council held in Westminster in 1184. Writing about Coutances' time <b>at</b> <b>Lincoln,</b> Gerald of Wales accused the bishop of increasing the debt of the diocese of Lincoln and of squandering its resources. Coutances helped the schools in the city of Lincoln, acting as the patron for scholars such as John of Tynemouth and Simon of Southwell.|$|E

5|$|Alexander {{spent most}} of 1145 and 1146 at the papal court in Rome, {{although}} some time during that period he was in England {{as one of the}} witnesses to the peace accord signed between the earls of Chester and Leicester. He returned to the papal court, then at Auxerre, in 1147, but he was back in England by {{the time of his death}} the following year. Henry of Huntingdon says that Alexander picked up his last illness while travelling. Alexander died in February 1148, probably on the 20th, as that was the date on which his death was commemorated <b>at</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Cathedral, and he was buried <b>at</b> <b>Lincoln</b> on 25 February 1148. No tomb remains, but 12th-century documents record that Alexander left the cathedral a number of books, mostly biblical works.|$|E

The statue has remained on public display, and was restored and regilded in 2016.|$|E

5|$|Chesney left {{at least}} ten books to Lincoln Cathedral, of which seven survive.

Geoffrey of Monmouth's last work, the Vita Merlini, was dedicated to Chesney. Foliot owned a copy of the Digest, part of the Corpus iuris civilis, that had originally been glossed for Chesney.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to their Flying Dutchman recordings and subsequent Arista recordings, Winter in America utilized a sparse production quality and {{small number of}} sessions musicians. A small supporting line-up, featuring drummer Bob Adams and bassist Danny Bowens, contributed on a few cuts.

5|$|In practice, {{there was}} a wide number of {{variations}} to this common design. A castle could {{have more than one}} bailey: at Warkworth Castle an inner and an outer bailey was constructed, or alternatively, several baileys could flank the motte, as at Windsor Castle. Some baileys had two mottes, such as those <b>at</b> <b>Lincoln.</b> Some mottes could be square instead of round, such as at Cabal Trump. Instead of single ditches, occasionally double-ditch defences were built, as seen at Berkhamsted. Local geography and the intent of the builder produced many unique designs.|$|E
