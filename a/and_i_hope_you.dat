5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> love it.|$|E
500|$|The Junta {{reconfirmed}} the order, but excluded {{the bishop}} of Córdoba, Rodrigo de Orellana, who was banished instead. Castelli was commissioned by the Junta to enforce the execution order. Mariano Moreno said, [...] "Go, Castelli, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> will not incur the same weakness as our general, if not yet fulfilled the determination, Larrea will go, and finally I'll go myself if necessary". Ocampo and Chiclana were demoted. Castelli's assistants were Nicolás Rodríguez Peña, elected as secretary, his former client Diego Paroissien as a campaign doctor, and Domingo French {{as head of the}} escort.|$|E
500|$|His {{work as a}} {{composer}} was much esteemed during his lifetime but is not well known today. The Crucifixion {{is one of the}} few major works of his that is still regularly performed. It is often given in Anglican churches during Holy Week and forms part of the repertoire of numerous choirs. He also made a lasting contribution to the music of Christmas in his Christmas Carols New and Old (1871), produced in collaboration with the Revd. H. R. Bramley, which marked an important stage in the revival of the Christmas carol. The book includes Stainer's arrangements of what were to become the standard versions of [...] "What Child Is This", [...] "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen", [...] "Good King Wenceslas", [...] "The First Nowell", and [...] "I Saw Three Ships", among others. He was a skilled musician and accompanist and Walter Galpin Alcock, who was taught composition by Arthur Sullivan at the National Training School for Music, recalls Sullivan saying [...] "I was at St Paul's yesterday, listening to Dr Stainer extemporising. My dear young friends, he is a genius, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> will miss no chance of hearing him." [...] John Stainer was also a close friend of Edmund Hart Turpin, the later Hon. Secr. of the Royal College of Organists for more than fifty years.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, see here, Nathan, {{it begins}} to look as though there was goin' to be a row for a fact, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>you</b> lived close by so I could go to your house till it was over." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{band was}} {{still searching for}} a lead singer. Chimes recalls one Billy Watts (who [...] "seemed to be, like, {{nineteen}} or eighteen then, as we all were") handling the duties for a time. Rhodes had his eye on Strummer, with whom he made exploratory contact. Jones and Levene had both seen him perform and were impressed as well. Strummer, for his part, was primed to make the switch. In April, he had taken in the opening act {{for one of his}} band's gigs—the Sex Pistols. Strummer later explained:I knew something was up, so I went out in the crowd which was fairly sparse. And I saw the future—with a snotty handkerchief—right in front of me. It was immediately clear. Pub rock was, [...] "Hello, you bunch of drunks, I'm gonna play these boogies <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> like them." [...] The Pistols came out that Tuesday evening and their attitude was, [...] "Here's our tunes, and we couldn't give a flying fuck whether you like them or not. In fact, we're gonna play them even if you fucking hate them."On 30 May, Rhodes and Levene met surreptitiously with Strummer after a 101'ers gig. Strummer was invited to meet up at the band's rehearsal location on Davis Road. After Strummer turned up, Levene grabbed his guitar, stood several inches away from Strummer, {{looked him in the eye}} and then began playing [...] "Keys to Your Heart", one of Strummer's own tunes.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on August 7, 1987, in United States to 944 theatres. Warner Bros. did not arrange for an advance screening, as they believed that Madonna's appeal would draw moviegoers {{to come to the}} film. A pre-release celebration was held on August 6, 1987, at Times Square in New York, where Madonna arrived to promote the film. A crowd of almost 10,000 people assembled to watch Madonna. As an introduction to the day, the radio jockeys from New York's WHTZ radio station played Madonna's popular songs in the Square, atop a platform created for the event. The police closed off 43rd and 44th streets, but allowing the traffic to pass through Broadway and Seventh Avenue of Manhattan. Around 6 PM, limousines started to arrive at the Square, with celebrities and the actors of the film entering the fanfare. Madonna arrived in a low-cut, low-backed sequined evening gown and the short hair she had adopted for the film. Although she was late by about an hour, the crowd number continued increasing. Asking her fans good-naturedly to [...] "Shut up, so I can talk", Madonna thanked everybody for coming to the opening of Who's That Girl. She talked about her experience of arriving in Times Square eight years before, and said, [...] "I was completely awestruck. Ten years later, I see all of you who have come to see me, and I'm completely awestruck. Thank you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> like the movie." [...] Saying this Madonna departed from the platform, and walked to the National Theatre. Joseph A. Cincotti from The New York Times noted that most of the crowd were in their [...] late teenage years and early 20's. Some held up signs and photographs but he noticed the Madonna wannabes were absent, the adolescent girls who had imitated Madonna's early lace-and-leather look. This was a result of Madonna's more mature image from True Blue.|$|E

Well, I {{just wanted to make}} sure you knew that the single is gonna drop very soon. I worked on it with a French guy named Mirwais, and he is the shit. The album will be released worldwide on September 19, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> like my music." ...|$|E

"In {{the city}} of Valencia live Muslims, the nobles of my people, along with Christians <b>and</b> Jews. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> {{continue}} to govern in the same harmony, all working and living together in this noble land. Here, during my reign, Easter processions went out and Christians professed their religion freely, as our Quran recognises Christ <b>and</b> the Virgin. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> bestow the same treatment to the Muslims of Valencia." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, uncle!" [...] {{said the}} boy, [...] "may I not {{stay with you}} this one night? It is eight weary months since I have ever seen you, save by peering down through the tall balusters of the Princess's balcony, when the Knights were going to dinner in the hall, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>you</b> would keep me with you at least one night. See how late and dark it is--the Castle gates will be closed by this time." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'That's early tea, my boy,' was the answer, with a smile. 'There's {{dinner to}} come, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> will behave {{yourself}} well, and not use such expressions.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... “I’ll {{beat you}} out, though, brother mine,” he chuckled. “I’ll beat you out, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> {{no worse than}} that you rack your old engines into scrap.” ...|$|E
