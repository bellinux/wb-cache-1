25|$|In {{closed circuit}} SCUBA (rebreather) diving, exhaled carbon dioxide {{must be removed}} from the {{breathing}} system, usually by <b>a</b> <b>scrubber</b> containing a solid chemical compound with a high affinity for CO2, such as soda lime. If not removed from the system, it may be re-inhaled, causing an increase in the inhaled concentration.|$|E
25|$|A helium reclaim system (or {{push-pull}} system) {{may be used}} {{to recover}} helium based breathing gas after use by the divers as this is more economical than losing it to the environment in open circuit systems. The recovered gas is passed through <b>a</b> <b>scrubber</b> system to remove carbon dioxide, filtered to remove odours, and pressurised into storage containers, where it may be mixed with oxygen to the required composition.|$|E
25|$|For Phase II {{compliance}} {{the options}} were numerous, but for Phase I they were {{constrained by the}} time available to implement a decision. Because it takes 3–5 years to design and build <b>a</b> <b>scrubber</b> at an existing coal-fired unit, and longer to repower or build a new facility (e.g., 6–11 years for coal, 10–14 years for nuclear units), electric utility decision options for Phase I plants were limited to scrubbing, switching fuels, purchasing or transferring emissions allowances to allow continued use of high-sulfur coal, retiring units, or trimming unit utilization and substituting capacity from another source.|$|E

25|$|As an {{alternative}} to TRUEX, an extraction process using a malondiamide has been devised. The DIAMEX (DIAMideEXtraction) process {{has the advantage of}} avoiding the formation of organic waste which contains elements other than carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Such an organic waste can be burned without the formation of acidic gases which could contribute to acid rain (although the acidic gases could be recovered by <b>a</b> <b>scrubber).</b> The DIAMEX process is being worked on in Europe by the French CEA. The process is sufficiently mature that an industrial plant could be constructed with the existing knowledge of the process. In common with PUREX this process operates by a solvation mechanism.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{compressed}} air, or Nitrox mixtures, the exhaled gas is not valuable enough to justify the expense of recycling, but helium-based mixtures are considerably more expensive, and as the depth increases, the amount of gas used (in terms of mass, or number of molecules) increases {{in direct proportion to}} the ambient pressure. As a result, gas cost is a significant factor in deep open circuit diving with helium-based mixtures for long periods. By using a return line for the exhaled gas, it can be recompressed and used again, almost indefinitely. It is necessary to remove carbon dioxide from the reclaimed gas, but this is relatively cheap and uncomplicated. It is generally removed by <b>a</b> <b>scrubber,</b> which is a filter packed with a chemical which reacts with and removes the carbon dioxide from the gas. The reclaimed gas is also filtered to remove odour and microorganisms, and oxygen is added to the required concentration. The gas is compressed for storage between uses.|$|E

In 1986, was completed and also uses <b>a</b> dual-alkali <b>scrubber.</b> From 2001 to 2005, Vectren installed four selective catalytic reduction (SCR) devices {{on all of the}} coal-fired units, which successfully cut nitrogen oxide emissions by 80 percent. In 2004, Vectren replaced an existing electrostatic precipitator at Unit 1 with a fabric filter. The investment increased the particulate matter removal efficiency to 99 percent at that unit.|$|R

It was the second most highly watched programme of the day.

Daughter of <b>a</b> <b>scrubber,</b> lesbian, under-age mother who gave away her own baby." [...] The row culminates with Sonia slapping Pauline, causing her to {{fall to the floor}} and break the Fowler fruit bowl—"the enduring symbol of her family, which smashed, significantly, into smithereens." [...] Though Pauline resolves to stay and reunite with her family in the end, she does not get the chance, as she collapses and dies in the middle of Albert Square, leaving both characters and viewers in uncertainty about the cause of her demise.|$|E
2500|$|Given its {{affinity}} for chlorinated compounds, liquid HCBD {{is used as}} <b>a</b> <b>scrubber</b> in order to remove chlorine containing contaminants from gas streams.

2500|$|Atmospheric {{diving suits}} built by German firm Neufeldt and Kuhnke were {{used during the}} salvage of gold and silver bullion from {{the wreck of the}} British ship SS Egypt, an 8,000 ton P liner that sank in May 1922. The suit was relegated to duties as an {{observation}} chamber at the wreck's depth, and was successfully used to direct mechanical grabs which opened up the bullion storage. In 1917, Benjamin F. Leavitt of Traverse City, Michigan, dived on the SS Pewabic which sank to a depth of [...] in Lake Huron in 1865, salvaging 350 tons of copper ore. In 1923, he went on to salvage the wreck of the British schooner Cape Horn which lay in [...] of water off Pichidangui, Chile, salvaging $600,000 worth of copper. Leavitt's suit was of his own design and construction. The most innovative aspect of Leavitt's suit was {{the fact that it was}} completely self-contained and needed no umbilical, the breathing mixture being supplied from a tank mounted on the back of the suit. The breathing apparatus incorporated <b>a</b> <b>scrubber</b> and an oxygen regulator and could last for up to a full hour.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the larger}} multiplace chambers, {{patients}} inside the chamber breathe from either [...] "oxygen hoods" [...] – flexible, transparent soft plastic hoods with a seal {{around the neck}} similar to a space suit helmet – or tightly fitting oxygen masks, which supply pure oxygen and may be designed to directly exhaust the exhaled gas from the chamber. During treatment patients breathe 100% oxygen {{most of the time}} to maximise the effectiveness of their treatment, but have periodic [...] "air breaks" [...] during which they breathe chamber air (21% oxygen) {{to reduce the risk of}} oxygen toxicity. The exhaled treatment gas must be removed from the chamber to prevent the buildup of oxygen, which could present a fire risk. Attendants may also breathe oxygen some of the time to reduce their risk of decompression sickness when they leave the chamber. The pressure inside the chamber is increased by opening valves allowing high-pressure air to enter from storage cylinders, which are filled by an air compressor. Chamber air oxygen content is kept between 19% and 23% to control fire risk (US Navy maximum 25%). If the chamber does not have <b>a</b> <b>scrubber</b> sysytem to remove carbon dioxide from the chamber gas, the chamber must be isobarically ventilated to keep the CO2 within acceptable limits.|$|E
