5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol {{because of}} how British social policy treated {{children}} at the time, and wished to use the novella {{as a means to}} put forward his arguments against it. The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in poverty—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.|$|E
5|$|Fine needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) {{can be used}} to biopsy bone lesions, {{once found}} on an X-ray or other scan. Such tests can be vital in diagnosis and can also prevent unnecessary treatment and invasive surgery. Conversely, FNA biopsy of tumors of the parathyroid gland is not recommended for diagnosing parathyroid carcinoma and may in fact be harmful, as the needle can puncture the tumor, leading to dissemination <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> spread of cancerous cells.|$|E

5|$|Given its size, rock/ice {{composition}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> {{presence of}} salt or ammonia in solution {{to lower the}} freezing point of water, Ariel's interior may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (372km) is about 64% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 56% of the moon's mass—the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Ariel is about 0.3GPa (3kbar). The current state of the icy mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the dodo was {{assigned}} the genus Didus, now a junior synonym of Raphus. In 1848, {{a new species}} within the now defunct genus Didus, D. nazarenus, was named by Hugh Edwin Strickland and Alexander Gordon Melville. To house their new species, {{as well as the}} other species known at the time, Strickland and Melville named the subfamily Didinae. In 1893 three species were assigned to the group Pezophaps solitarius, Didus ineptus, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> species Didus borbonicus. Today, only two raphine species are known, with Didus ineptus becoming a junior subjective synonym of Raphus cucullatus; Didus? borbonicus now classified as the ibis Threskiornis solitarius; and Didus nazarenus being identified as synonymous with Pezophaps solitarius.|$|E
5|$|In 1862, Wallace {{returned}} to England, where {{he moved in}} with his sister Fanny Sims and her husband Thomas. While recovering from his travels, Wallace organised his collections and gave numerous lectures about his adventures and discoveries to scientific societies such as the Zoological Society of London. Later that year, he visited Darwin at Down House, and became friendly with both Charles Lyell and Herbert Spencer. During the 1860s, Wallace wrote papers and gave lectures defending natural selection. He also corresponded with Darwin about a variety of topics, including sexual selection, warning colouration, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> effect of natural selection on hybridisation and the divergence of species. In 1865, he began investigating spiritualism.|$|E

5|$|Mammals are {{plentiful}} in the Hell Creek Formation. Groups represented include multituberculates, metatherians, and eutherians. The multituberculates represented include Paracimexomys, the cimolomyids Paressonodon, Meniscoessus, Essonodon, Cimolomys, Cimolodon, and Cimexomys; and the neoplagiaulacids Mesodma, and Neoplagiaulax. The alphadontids Alphadon, Protalphodon, and Turgidodon, pediomyids Pediomys, Protolambda, and Leptalestes, the stagodontid Didelphodon, the deltatheridiid Nanocuris, the herpetotheriid Nortedelphys, and the glasbiid Glasbius all represent metatherians of the Hell Creek Formation. A few eutherians are known, being represented by Alostera, Protungulatum, the cimolestids Cimolestes and Batodon, the gypsonictopsid Gypsonictops, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> nyctitheriid Paranyctoides.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{and other}} smaller cetaceans, mainly dolphins, are hunted in an {{activity}} known as drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Porpoises are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, porpoises are mostly hunted for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> health risk that the high methylmercury levels impose, thousands of porpoises are caught in drive hunts each year.|$|E

The failure of this and other strikes {{in the years following}} World War I contributed to declining union membership in subsequent years. The American Federation of Labor responded to political pressure experienced during the strike and revoked the charters it had granted to police unions. That ended police unionism in the U.S. for two decades, as police would not try to organize until World War II.|$|E
5|$|This {{meeting was}} between NATO leaders and {{president}} of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma. NATO members expressed appreciation for Ukraine’s contributions to NATO-led and other international peace support efforts such as KFOR. Ukraine also offered to support Operation Active Endeavour in the Mediterranean (a naval operation of NATO {{which is designed to}} prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction), an offer which NATO would consider. Defence cooperation between NATO and Ukraine was reviewed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> launching of a Partnership for Peace Trust Fund to help Ukraine destroy the surplus munitions, small arms and light weapons was discussed.|$|E

5|$|Tomb 4 was {{set into}} the floor of Structure 2B in the 8th century AD and is the richest burial known from Calakmul. The tomb {{contained}} a male skeleton wrapped in textiles and jaguar pelts that were partially preserved with resin. The tomb contained rich offerings that included jade ear ornaments handed down from the Early Classic, a jade mosaic mask, shell and bone beads, spiny oyster shells, eccentric obsidian blades, fine ceramics {{and the remains of}} wooden objects. One of the ceramics was a plate with a hieroglyphic text that specifically named king Yuknoom Yich'aak K'ak' as its owner. The remains and the offering were placed in an arched wooden bier carved with elaborate decoration and hieroglyphs that was painted in a variety of colours. The bier has almost completely decayed but left an impression in the mud packed around it. Due to the plate <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> association of Stelae 115 and 116 with the burial the tomb is believed to be that of the late 7th-century king Yuknoom Yich'aak K'ak'.|$|E
