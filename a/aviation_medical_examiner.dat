For instance, the most common deficiencies are (1) failure to address items airmen checked “yes” or left blank in blocks 13, 17, 18, or 19 of the examination form, and (2) the history given does not provide the information required by the Guide for <b>Aviation</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Examiners.</b> Please do not misunderstand, I am not trying to say that airmen wh...|$|R

25|$|Although {{technically}} not a university, the FAA's Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center {{has many}} aspects of an institution of higher learning. Its FAA Academy is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Its Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI) has a medical education division responsible for aeromedical education in general {{as well as the}} education of <b>aviation</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examiners</b> in the U.S. and 93 other countries. In addition, The National Academy of Science offers Research Associateship Programs for fellowship and other grants for CAMI research.|$|R

By federal law, all aviators must be medically certified. Airman medical certificates are issued by the division {{on the basis of}} physical examinations performed by <b>Aviation</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Examiners</b> (AMEs); approximately 3,500 physicians who are authorized to conduct <b>aviation</b> <b>medical</b> examinations of civil airmen throughout the United States and abroad. [...] The Division manages a national repository of airmen medical records and a system for processing such records; it administers review systems for the professional evaluation and disposition of applications for medical certification; and makes recommendations to the Federal Air Surgeon on the disposition of requests for special issuance certification.|$|R
50|$|Training of African-American men as <b>aviation</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examiners</b> was {{conducted}} through correspondence courses until 1943, when two black physicians were {{admitted to the}} U.S. Army School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Field, Texas. This {{was one of the}} earliest racially integrated courses in the U.S. Army. Seventeen flight surgeons served with the Tuskegee Airmen from 1941-49. At that time, the typical tour of duty for a U.S. Army flight surgeon was four years. Six of these physicians lived under field conditions during operations in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy. The chief flight surgeon to the Tuskegee Airmen was Dr. Vance H. Marchbanks, Jr., MD, a childhood friend of Benjamin Davis.|$|R

50|$|In the US, {{a student}} pilot {{certificate}} is issued to a pilot in training, {{and is a}} pre-requisite {{for the student to}} fly alone in the aircraft, or solo. It is not (anymore) initially issued by a medical doctor who is also an authorized <b>aviation</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examiner,</b> in conjunction with the student's first medical certificate. Instead, as of April 1, 2016, the <b>aviation</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examiner</b> gives the student a medical certificate. The student takes the certificate to his/her instructor who then completes an application. The application is sent to the FAA which will send the student pilot certificate to the student.|$|E
50|$|The {{civilian}} {{equivalent of}} the flight surgeon is the <b>Aviation</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Examiner</b> (AME).

40|$|Association (AOPA) has {{developed}} an on-line tool for their members {{to assist them in}} completing their FAA medical examination form (Form 8500 - 8).

Airmen are completing the form on-line, printing a copy, and asking <b>aviation</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examiners</b> to accept them in lieu of completing one of the AME’s forms. RESULT One of our AMEs accepted this form and successfully transmitted an examination into the Aerospace Medical Certification Subsystem, using the dummy “FF ” number.
