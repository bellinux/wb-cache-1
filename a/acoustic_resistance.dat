Select codes {{developed over the}} past two decades at the NASA Lewis Research Center are used.

Effects of the laminate lay-up and environment on the acoustic fatigue life are evaluated. The results show that, by keeping the angled plies on the outer surface of the laminate, a substantial increase in the acoustic fatigue life is obtained. The effect of environment (temperature and moisure) is to relieve the residual stresses leading to an increase in the acoustic fatigue life of the excited panel...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Each nasal area, {{as defined}} by Cottle, has a {{different}} influence on the nasal airflow. The longitudinal distribution of resistances in nasal cavities was calculated by the anterior rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry data. DESIGN: Dynamic study of Cottle's areas in normal subjects {{was carried out by}} rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry. SETTING: Study by the Department of Otolaryngology of the University of Rome-La Sapienza. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven Caucasian adults in local and general healthy conditions took part and completed this study, with a total of 54 nasal cavities included because of negativity at ENT-examination and clinical history, with normal respiratory parameters at the rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We determined nasal and <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistances,</b> nasal volumes and cross-sectional surface areas, {{as defined by}} Cottle, using nasal endoscopy. The longitudinal distribution of nasal resistances was obtained by integrating experimental surface areas using a novel mathematical model. The estimation of the longitudinal nasal resistance variations {{as a result of a}} theoretical reduction of the surface areas. RESULTS: The reduction of the 2 - 3 - 1 areas (in this order of importance) showed the greatest influence on the nasal resistances with coefficients of determinations greater than 0. 98, this being quite different from that of the areas 4 and 5 for quite smaller area reduction percentages. CONCLUSIONS: The areas 2 - 3 - 1 control the overall nasal resistance so the surgical procedures on these areas greatly influence the dynamics of nasal airflow. The mathematical model developed here gives useful information to nasal functional surgery and may be applied to other schemes of nasal cavity...|$|R

5000|$|Dynaco also {{distributed}} the famous SEAS 'A-Series' of bookshelf loudspeakers that were manufactured in Denmark, using input from Dynaco's David Hafler and SEAS' Ragnar Lian. The A-Series were marketed between from 1970 until Dynaco's demise in the 1980s. The Dynaco A-25 model {{proved to be}} extremely successful, selling between 600,000 and 1,000,000 units. A modified aperiodic bass reflex design using SEAS speakers in a handsome wood cabinet, the A-25 sold for $79.95 each in 1969 making it competitive with much more expensive loudspeakers. The patented aperiodic (essentially non-resonant) woofer design utilized a highly damped vent instead of a reflex port, whose <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> is very carefully controlled. The resistant venting action lowered the [...] "Q" [...] {{of the system and}} reduced impedance variation near resonance in the A-Series speakers. Dynaco followed the A-25 with the slightly larger A-35, which featured a dual-chambered, non-vented design in a walnut-veneered cabinet with even greater transparency and fidelity. Over time, Dynaco marketed a wide range of loudspeakers, ranging from the small A-10 model to the floor standing A-50 series. After some 30 years, these loudspeakers still command good prices in markets such as eBay, and are a testimonial to their quality.|$|E

40|$|With this study, {{we provide}} a global link between linear and {{non-linear}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> of a perforation {{as a function}} of orifice geometry and Strouhal number. High amplitudes of acoustic pressure induce flow separation {{at the edges of the}} orifices. This is a non-linear mechanism increasing the <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> of a perforation. Quasi-static models have been used to predict the <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> in the non-linear regime, yet the linear to non-linear transition has been out of focus so far. We carry out open-end impedance measurements in a semi-anechoic room with four different samples. These samples are selected to have different orifice geometries and edge profiles, so that the conclusions would be general. The most prominent result of this study is that the change in the non-linear resistance can be expressed {{as a function of}} the Strouhal number only, if the resistance is corrected for the vena-contracta factor which can be deduced from steady flow measurements. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{unification}} {{of the theory}} of the nonlinear <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> of Helmholtz resonators including grazing flow is presented. The nonlinear resistance due to grazing flow is considered to be caused by an exciting pressure spectrum produced by the interaction of the grazing flow and the jets flowing from the resonator orifices. With this exciting pressure spectrum the resonator can be treated {{in the same manner as}} a resonator without grazing flow but with an exciting acoustic spectrum. One of the important implications of this model is that a multiple-degree-of-freedom resonator can be analyzed with grazing flow. Using the grazing flow pressure spectrum, the nonlinear <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> can be properly distributed among the several elements of the resonator...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of the {{transverse}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> {{of liquid}} helium- 3 {{have been made}} at pressures between 0. 3 bar and 28. 0 bar in the temperature range 0. 015 Kelvin to 1. 0 Kelvin using a helium- 3 /helium- 4 dilution refrigerator. The method involved observation of the decay {{of a series of}} echos generated in a piezoelectric rod immersed in the liquid, one end of the rod being excited by a resonant cavity. The frequency of this cavity was 242 MHz in the greater proportion of this work but similar measurements were also made at 1048 MHz. The measurements at the lower frequency have confirmed the existence of the collective oscillation known as transverse zero sound in liquid helium- 3 at higher pressures, as predicted by the Landau Theory of a Fermi liquid. This has enabled an estimate to be made of the magnitude of the symmetrical Landau parameter, F 2 S. The result obtained was in agreement with those of other experimenters who have used a variety of methods to determine F 2 S. A similar experimental technique has been used to study the longitudinal <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> of liquid helium- 3 in order to investigate the anomalously high value of F 2 S indicated by previous measurements of this phenomenon. These measurements, both transverse and longitudinal, have mainly been carried out on pure helium- 3 (ie. better than 99. 9997 per cent) but some data have been obtained for the transverse <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistance</b> of helium- 3 in which a small amount of helium- 4 (about 1 %) was present.

40|$|Rib-slab (Hordi) roofs are {{commonly}} used {{in the construction of}} buildings in Saudi Arabia. Compared to the traditional solid-slab roofs, Hordi roofs are lighter and have higher thermal and <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistances.</b> Despite their widespread use in recent years, only little information is available regarding their thermal characteristics in general, and none under optimised insulation conditions. The geometrical configuration of the Hordi units is strictly two-dimensional, however, the heat flow across the roof is predominantly one-dimensional. By modeling the layers in a Hordi unit by thermal resistances connected in parallel, an "equivalent" one-dimensional model is obtained for the roof. A finite-volume time-dependent implicit procedure, which has been previously validated, is used in conjunction with this model to compute the yearly heat transmission loads for different insulation layer thickness while accounting for solar radiation and long wave radiation exchange with the sky. These loads, calculated under steady periodic conditions using the climatic data of Riyadh, are used in an economic model {{in order to determine the}} optimum insulation thickness (Lopt). Three roof configurations are investigated all with a polystyrene insulation layer. Roof R 1 is a traditional solid-slab roof, roof R 2 is a rib-slab roof with Hordi units made of polystyrene, and roof R 3 is a rib-slab roof with Hordi units made of concrete. Under the conditions of the present study, values of L opt obtained are: 4. 8, 3. 7 and 4. 2 cm, for R 1, R 2 and R 3, respectively. Under optimum conditions, R 2 gives the lowest total cost of insulation and energy consumption over the lifetime of the building, while R 3 gives the lowest decrement factor (0. 0047) and the longest time lag (13. 2 h); R 1 is found to be the least favoured roof in these respects. The average R-value for the three roofs is about 2. 2 m 2 K/W. King Saud Universit...|$|R

Samples were fabricated to cover typical variations in perforated face-sheet parameters, such as hole diameter, porosity and sheet thickness, as well as those due to different manufacturing processes. The DC flow resistance data from perforated sheets were found to correlate strongly with the grazing flow Mach number and the face-sheet porosity. The data also show correlation against the boundary layer displacement thickness to hole-diameter ratio. The increase in resistance with grazing flow for punched aluminum sheets is in good agreement with published results up to Mach 0. 4, but is significantly larger than expected above Mach 0. 4. Finally, the tests demonstrated that there is a significant increase in the resistance of linear 'wiremesh' type face-sheet materials...|$|E
