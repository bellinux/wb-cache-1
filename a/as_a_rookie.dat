5|$|McElhenny was {{a first-round}} {{pick of the}} San Francisco 49ers in the 1952 NFL Draft, ninth overall, and made an {{immediate}} impression <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rookie.</b> His first play as a professional was a 40-yard touchdown run which had been drawn in the dirt because {{he had not yet}} learned the team's playbook. He recorded the season's longest run from scrimmage (89 yards), the longest punt return (94 yards), and the top rushing average (7.0 yards per carry).

5|$|Drafted by the Baltimore Colts in {{the twentieth}} round as the 203rd overall pick of the 1954 NFL Draft, Berry was {{considered}} a long-shot {{to make the team}} roster.

Wensloff finished the season with a 13–11 record and a 2.54 ERA in 29 games, 27 of them starts. He did not pitch in the 1943 World Series, though he was on the roster.|$|E

5|$|From 1947 through 1956, each BBWAA voter used {{discretion}} {{as to who}} qualified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>rookie.</b> In 1957, {{the term}} was first defined as someone with fewer than 75 at bats or 45 innings pitched in any previous Major League season. This guideline was later amended to 90 at bats, 45 innings pitched, or 45 days on a Major League roster before September 1 of the previous year. The current standard of 130 at bats, 50 innings pitched or 45 days on the active roster of a Major League club (excluding time in military service or on the disabled list) before September 1 was adopted in 1971.|$|E
