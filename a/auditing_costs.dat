40|$|Some {{academics}} and politicians {{have proposed that}} taxpayers should be reimbursed for costs of randomly imposed tax audits, because, they argue, randomly imposing <b>audit</b> <b>costs</b> is unfair. But none of those proposing audit compensation has explained why randomly imposed <b>audit</b> <b>costs</b> are unfair, or why, if these randomly imposed costs are unfair, this unfairness necessarily means that taxpayers should be compensated. These are important questions, because explicit randomness is an essential tool for tax enforcement, and for other areas of law, but its use may be limited if randomness is equated with unfairness. The Article argues that it is fair not to compensate randomly audited taxpayers for their <b>audit</b> <b>costs,</b> because the available of insurance against random <b>audit</b> <b>costs</b> cures fairness concerns under luck egalitarianism. Fairness may nonetheless matter for a less obvious reason: notwithstanding philosophical arguments to the contrary, individuals may perceive random audits as unfair. Empirical work has shown that individuals have a taste for fairness in tax law, and that the perception that tax law is unfair may reduce tax compliance. Therefore, perceived unfairness should be of concern to welfarists, among others. Based on a comparison of random audits with other burdens randomly imposed by the government, the Article concludes that perceived unfairness may warrant nominal compensation for random <b>audit</b> <b>costs.</b> The costs of the perceived unfairness of random audits, as opposed to other types of randomly imposed burdens, may be particularly high because of general ignorance about, and negative perceptions of, our tax system. Compensation for random <b>audit</b> <b>costs</b> is therefore warranted {{not because it is}} actually unfair to impose <b>audit</b> <b>costs</b> randomly, but rather because such compensation may help to overcome perceptions of unfairness and thus to increase overall tax compliance...|$|R

The average audit fee increase from 2003 to 2004 of $ 2. 3 million is significant and is primarily attributable to the new SOX <b>audit.</b> SOX <b>audit</b> <b>costs</b> appear to be based on company size, asset growth, and the effectiveness of internal controls in addition to the 2003 financial statement audit rate. Specifically, the SOX <b>audit</b> <b>costs</b> increase with size, but the SOX <b>audit</b> unit <b>costs</b> vary inversely with size. This inverse relationship is consistent with larger companies benefiting from returns to scale and smaller companies spending fewer resources on internal controls and being more likely to have material weaknesses in internal controls. The positive relationship between SOX <b>audit</b> <b>costs</b> and asset growth supports the notion that rapidly growing firms {{may not be able to}} update their internal control systems in a timely manner and, therefore, may be more likely to experience internal control weaknesses.

We study a principal-agent model in which the firm’s manager is privately informed about a cost parameter and exerts unobservable cost reducing effort, while the owner can conduct costly audits to obtain information about the firm’s cost. Without auditing, managerial effort (and therefore pro-duction efficiency) is strictly higher under public governance with a benevolent government. If auditing is possible, however, a profit-maximizing private owner always audits at least as frequently as a public principal. For small <b>auditing</b> <b>costs,</b> we find that monitoring decisions, managerial effort and welfare under both governance structures coincide.

Without regional transfers, fiscal competition leads to audit rates which are inefficiently low for revenue-maximizing governments. While in general GRS aggravates the inefficiency, NRS makes the decentralized choice of auditing policies more efficient.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{quantitative}} study of accounting compliance and <b>audit</b> <b>costs</b> in Swedish municipal organisations, consisting of four papers. Three {{of the papers}} explore factors that explain accounting compliance concerning financial reporting and revenue recognition in Swedish municipal water, sewerage and solid waste management organisations. The fourth paper explores the determinants of professional <b>audit</b> <b>costs</b> in Swedish municipal administrations. The overall purpose of this thesis is {{to contribute to the}} knowledge of what factors influence accounting compliance and <b>audit</b> <b>costs</b> in municipal organisations. Explaining accounting compliance in the water and sewerage and solid waste management sectors reveals that these sectors are influenced partly by different factors and partly by the same factors but differently. The results indicate that the strength and the strictness of the institutional framework (legislation, sanctions, court cases) {{play an important role in}} relation to if and how each sector is influenced by certain economic, political and institutional factors. Further, the studies show that factors like market competition, legal form of corporation, regionalisation, cross-sectoral coordination and engaged audit firm alter, replace or introduce new institutional, political and economic forces that influence accounting compliance. These are all factors that can be linked to municipal reforms, thus providing some evidence on the consequences of such reforms. Regarding <b>audit</b> <b>costs</b> the results of the thesis also indicate that <b>audit</b> <b>costs</b> vary dependent upon external stakeholder factors (population, tax base and tax rate), which supports the proposition that <b>audit</b> <b>cost</b> might be influenced by external monitoring demand and political signalling incentives. The implication is that audit might not only be a tool to secure compliance; it might also be a tool to manage stakeholder relations. From a policy perspective, the results indicate that the changing institutional and organisational environment (municipal governance reforms) has not been matched by attention to, and regulation of, reporting structures that secure external vertical accountability reporting, neither at the utility service level and nor at the consolidated municipal level. The general implication for future policy and regulations should therefore be to recognise the influence of different economic and institutional forces and develop accountability models that enable and preserve the benefits of governance forms and structures without losing transparency and accountability. The findings of this thesis suggest that accounting regulation and audit control need to bridge the public–private sector divide, level out sector-specific regulations and possibly connect regulation and accountability to the consolidated municipal organisation in order to preserve organisational freedom while securing compliant accountability information to relevant stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the push}} for reform in the Australian public sector audit has placed the Office of the Auditor-General (hereafter OAG) in a more {{contestable}} or market- like environment, where the OAG is accountable for an efficient and effective provision of public sector audit. The {{purpose of this study}} is to compare the cost efficiency of in-house and contract-out arrangements to deliver financial audits in the public sector. It empirically tests whether there are <b>audit</b> <b>cost</b> and <b>audit</b> fee differences between in-house providers (i. e., the OAG) and contractors (i. e., public accounting firms). The secondary aims of this study are to develop <b>audit</b> <b>cost</b> and fee models for the public sector. The unit of analysis is audit cost/fee at the audit engagement level. The data for this study is collected for a sample of financial statement audit engagements for year-end 1998, at the state level in Western Australia. The data is extracted from publicly available and private sources. The <b>audit</b> <b>cost</b> and fee models are used to test for the cost differences between in- house providers and contractors. Prior audit production and audit fee studies in the private and public sectors provide the basis for the development of the two models. The results indicate that agency size, complexity and risk are positively associated with <b>audit</b> <b>costs</b> and <b>audit</b> fees. In addition, the total advice provided to the agencies by the OAG and agency type are also significantly associated with <b>audit</b> <b>costs</b> and <b>audit</b> fees. Overall, by incorporating these factors into the models, the <b>audit</b> <b>cost</b> model explains 82 percent of the variance in <b>audit</b> <b>costs,</b> while the <b>audit</b> fee model explains 86 percent of the variance in audit fees. More importantly, the main findings suggest that contract-out audits are more costly than in-house audits. However, this finding is conditional on agency type. Further analysis reveals that the type of audit arrangement is significantly associated with <b>audit</b> <b>costs</b> for the statutory authority audits only. There is no significant difference in <b>audit</b> <b>costs</b> between contract-out and in-house arrangement for hospital audits. This analysis shows that the statutory authority audits are driving the significance of the interaction between type of audit arrangement and agency type. Specifically, the <b>costs</b> of contract-out <b>audits</b> are, on average, significantly higher than in-house audits. This result is attributed to the contractor 2 ̆ 7 s lack of expertise in auditing statutory authority as there is no equivalent of this agency type in the private sector. As such, the OAG bas the greater advantage of delivering a lower <b>audit</b> <b>cost</b> for statutory authority audits compared to the contractors. However, the non-significant interaction term in the audit fee model suggests that cost differences between in-house and contract-out audits for the statutory authority audits are not reflected in audit fees billed to agencies. Further analyses, using audit hours as the dependent variable, generally corroborate the findings from the <b>audit</b> <b>cost</b> and <b>audit</b> fee models. Sensitivity analyses on the OAG 2 ̆ 7 s supervision costs reveal that these costs have a significant effect on the interpretation of the cost efficiency results. By excluding supervision <b>costs</b> from contract-out <b>audits,</b> there are significant changes in the results for the total sample and the two sub-samples (partitioned by agency type). Generally, these changes favour the contract-out audits for all groupings, where contract-out audits are now more cost efficient than in-house audits for hospitals, and not significantly different in costs for statutory authority audits. Additional tests to investigate the determinants of the GAG 2 ̆ 7 s supervision <b>costs</b> in contract-out <b>audits</b> reveal that agency size, risk, reliance on internal control, total advice provided by the OAG and packaged audits (a single contract for two or more audits) are significantly associated with the supervision <b>costs</b> of contract-out <b>audits.</b> The main contribution of this study is to add to the growing literature on audit market efficiency (see Dopuch, Gupta, Simunic 2 ̆ 6 Stein, 2000; Knechel 2 ̆ 6 Payne, forthcoming). It provides evidence on the production function of different type of suppliers in the public sector and their relative efficiency in providing audit services. This study contributes to the recent discussions on the changing nature of public sector audit market towards a market-based provision of public sector audits. The evidence from this study allows researchers and policy-makers to compare the two types of audit arrangement to undertake public sector audits. In pan, this study also contributes to the line of inquiry that examines the difference between government auditors and public accounting firms in US municipalities (Copley, 1989; Dwyer 2 ̆ 6 Wilson, 1989; Rubin, 1992). The secondary contribution of this study is to develop and test the <b>audit</b> <b>cost</b> and fee models in the public sector and provide validity on the transferability of audit models from the private and public sectors. This study adds to the literature that examines the public sector audit market. More importantly, it is one of the few non-US studies that examine the public sector audit market and the findings from this study suggest that the public sector audit studies from the US are generalisable to Australia. These findings add to our understanding of the range of market conditions under which it is so far known to hold...|$|R
