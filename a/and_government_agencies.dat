40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this conference paper is to provide an {{overview}} of our preliminary investigation into whether current government online training practice is conducive to the emerging practice of Web-based social networking. Research papers <b>and</b> Australian <b>government</b> <b>agency</b> reports were reviewed to draw comparisons between corporate sector <b>and</b> <b>government</b> <b>agency</b> online workforce training. There is limited information in the literature that evaluates government Web-based training. Not surprisingly, government focus groups identify a preference for face-to-face interaction over current online training in Australian <b>government</b> <b>agencies...</b>|$|R

5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, 2001, with {{consideration}} of other events including the Oklahoma City Bombing, the Federal Highway Administration proposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews <b>and</b> <b>government</b> <b>agencies</b> to enter the disaster area more quickly. By helping civilians out, and rescue workers in, the number of casualties will hopefully be decreased.|$|E

5|$|Nonprofit {{organizations}} <b>and</b> <b>government</b> <b>agencies</b> {{have special}} requirements to show, in financial statements and reports, how money is spent, rather than how much profit was earned. Unlike profit oriented businesses, which use a single set of self-balancing accounts (or general ledger), nonprofits {{can have more}} than one general ledger (or fund), depending on their financial reporting requirements. An accountant for such an entity must be able to produce reports detailing the expenditures and revenues for each of the organization's individual funds, and reports that summarize the organization's financial activities across all of its funds.|$|E
5|$|Private Ambulance Service – Normal {{commercial}} {{companies with}} paid employees, but often on contract {{to the local}} or national government. Private companies may provide only the patient transport elements of ambulance care (i.e. nonurgent or ambulatory transport), but in some places, they are contracted to provide emergency care, or to form a 'second tier' response. In many areas private services cover all emergency transport functions <b>and</b> <b>government</b> <b>agencies</b> do not provide this service. Companies such as Falck, Acadian Ambulance, and American Medical Response {{are some of the}} larger companies that provide such services. These organisations may also provide services known as 'Stand-by' cover at industrial sites or at special events. From April 2011 all private ambulance services in the UK must be Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered. Private services in Canada operate non-emergency patient transfers or for private functions only.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{participation}} of the royal and viceroyal figures in areas of governance is limited. In practice, {{their use of the}} executive powers is directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the Prime Minister of Canada (at present Justin Trudeau), the head of government. The governor general or monarch may, though, in certain crisis situations exercise their power without ministerial advice. To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the person who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is thus {{one of the most powerful}} institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown, besides the aforementioned, the governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations <b>and</b> <b>government</b> <b>agencies.</b> The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.|$|E
