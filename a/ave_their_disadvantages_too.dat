This work includes a wide range of banking products, in which the bills are used, indicating <b>their</b> advantages and <b>disadvantages</b> <b>too.</b> The conclusion provides justification for attractiveness of bills for the banks, but also the reasons for which it is viewed by public with some skepticism...|$|R

In the theoretical part of this work are introduced actual techniques in detection of this communication in network. There are presented <b>their</b> advantages and <b>disadvantages</b> <b>too.</b> The biggest attention {{is focused on}} the classification scheme of Mr. Bashir which deals with a detection of a protocol BitTorrent and a Skype application from Netflow. Following this scheme is designed a detection module for a modular system of a traffic analysis Nemea, developed by Cesnet organization. In the practical part of this work is introduced the implementation of this module. There are also presented results of experiments with real data...|$|R

50|$|A team {{may choose}} to artificially reduce their margin of victory, as {{measured}} by NRR, to gain an additional advantage by not <b>disadvantaging</b> <b>their</b> opponent <b>too</b> much. For example, {{in the final round}} of matches in the 1999 World Cup Group B, Australia needed to beat West Indies to progress to the Super Six stage, but wanted to carry West Indies through with them to the Super Six, rather than New Zealand. This is because Australia would then have the additional points in the Super Six stage from beating West Indies in the group stage, whereas they had lost to New Zealand in the group stage. It was therefore to Australia's advantage to reduce their scoring rate and reduce their margin of victory, as measured by NRR, to minimise the negative impact of the match on West Indies' NRR, and therefore maximise West Indies' chance of going through with them.|$|R

In {{order to}} compensate for the bias caused by a priori SNR estimation in the traditional MMSE approach, Gerkmann and Hendriks in [19] proposed an unbiased MMSE-based noise estimator which used the a posteriori speech presence probability as the weight of recursion. MMSE-based approaches can update the noise estimation continuously and thus have no delay in theory. But they still have <b>their</b> own <b>disadvantages,</b> e.g., relying <b>too</b> much on precise a priori SNR estimation [20], easy to cause over-estimation of noise and thus damaging the speech, especially when speech continuously exists in a lot of frames.|$|R
