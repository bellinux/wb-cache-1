25|$|The {{charge port}} area now {{comes with a}} light not {{provided}} on earlier models, {{and the ability to}} open the port door from inside the car or by using the key fob. The onboard charger in all 2013 Leafs has also been reduced in size and relocated to a new position under the hood, which increases cargo volume. The new base trim level is called the Leaf S model, and {{is the result of a}} strategy for affordability. The S trim replaces the LED headlights with less expensive projector beams, and uses 16-inch steel wheels with plastic covers rather than alloy wheels. The base trim does not include the navigation system and the remote connectivity that allows drivers to turn on the climate control and monitor battery charging remotely using a smartphone. LED headlamps, fog lights, 17-inch alloy wheels and leather seating, are reserved for the higher-end SL trim. Additional premium upgrades to the SL trim include a Bose seven-speaker audio system and <b>around</b> <b>view</b> monitor, which puts cameras in front, in back and on the side mirrors for parking assistance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Almost all the {{previous}} automatic parking systems update relative position between ego-vehicle and target parking slot by utilizing only in-vehicle motion sensor-based odometry. However, performance {{of these systems}} can be degraded due to cumulative errors of in-vehicle motion sensor-based odometry. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a method that continuously tracks target parking slot position by fusing <b>around</b> <b>view</b> monitor (AVM) images and in-vehicle motion sensor-based odometry. In experiments, the proposed method successfully tracks various types of parking slot markings in spite o...|$|E
