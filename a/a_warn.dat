25|$|The FJ Crawler {{was first}} offered in 2007 (for the 2008 model year) {{and is the}} result of a {{collaboration}} between Dealer Services International (DSI), known for building high quality custom packages for new vehicle dealers, and ARB, who has a long history building rugged off-road products. For participating Toyota new vehicle dealerships, the FJ Crawler could be special ordered for customers who were looking for a vehicle that is even more rugged and off-road ready than a standard Off-Road Package factory option would provide. The FJ Crawler package included an ARB Front Bull Bar Bumper, an Old Man Emu 3-inch suspension lift to support the added weight of the ARB bumper and to allow for the 17-inch Pro Comp wheels with either 33 or 35-inch off-roading tires. The FJ Crawler was able to be customized in many ways with many optional accessories to achieve the customers satisfaction. For example, the FJ Crawler could be ordered in any factory color for the current model year. The customer could choose from 3 different wheel choices, 3 different tire choices, and could even choose the exact springs and shocks used in the Old Man Emu suspension to achieve the desired ride/performance quality. There was also the option of adding accessories such as <b>a</b> <b>Warn</b> winch, IFP driving lights which would be mounted to the ARB bumper, a fog light kit for the ARB bumper, and an ARB roof rack for storing gear and other items. Other options included a cat-back exhaust system, a high flow intake, as well as side steps. Also, because of variances in aftermarket tire sizes, speedometer calibration was provided to ensure correct vehicle speed and mileage are recorded.|$|E

40|$|Editor 2 ̆ 7 s Note] The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act is {{the federal}} law that {{requires}} companies with 100 or more workers to provide 60 days notice of a plant closing or mass layoff. It took effect in February 1989. The Economic Dislocation and Worker Adjustment Assistance (EDWAA) Act is basically {{what used to be}} Title III of the Jobs Training Partnership Act (JTPA); it {{is the federal}} funding source for direct assistance to dislocated workers. EDWAA, which took effect in July 1989, is not just a funding pool; it includes significant but virtually unknown regulations that unions can use for job retention. WARN and EDWAA overlap. When a company gives <b>a</b> <b>WARN</b> notice, EDWAA requires the states to respond rapidly to start the delivery of 2 ̆ 2 adjustment 2 ̆ 2 services to affected workers. For the inside skivvy on the two laws, LRR Contributing Editor Greg LeRoy interviewed MCLR Research Director Greg LeRoy, who has been hawking the two laws (and their predecessors) for eight years...|$|E

A semi-structure interview and non-participant observation were used by the researcher while having class activity. Based on that observation and data analysis, it was found that there were three punishments found used by teacher in teaching English. They were giving point by using tartib book, rewriting duty or homework five times, and paying every useless word by using money. Giving point was the most dominant punishment used by teacher. The reason why teacher used the dominant punishment due to the more student got points they would be kicked out from the school and it seemed that it was an effective way to make student behave.
