5|$|More recently, {{research}} at the Duke Lemur Center {{has shown that the}} ring-tailed lemur can organize sequences in memory <b>and</b> <b>retrieve</b> ordered sequences without language. The experimental design demonstrated that the lemurs were using internal representation of the sequence to guide their responses and not simply following a trained sequence, where one item in the sequence cues the selection of the next. But this is not the limit of the ring-tailed lemur's reasoning skills. Another study, performed at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve, suggests that this species along with several other closely related lemur species understand simple arithmetic operations.|$|E
