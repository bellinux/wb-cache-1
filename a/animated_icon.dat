40|$|Abstract Digital toys {{offer the}} {{opportunity}} to explore software scaffolding through tangible interfaces that are not bound to the desktop computer. This paper describes the empirical work completed by the CACHET (Computers and Children's Electronic Toys) project team investigating young children's use of interactive toy technology. The interactive toys in question are plush and cuddly cartoon characters with embedded sensors that can be squeezed to evoke spoken feedback from the toy. In addition to playing with the toy as it stands, the toy {{can be linked to}} a desktop PC with compatible software using a wireless radio connection. Once this connection is made the toy offers hints and tips to the children as they play with the accompanying software games. If the toy is absent, the same hints and tips are available through an on-screen <b>animated</b> <b>icon</b> of the toy's cartoon character. The toys as they stand are not impressive as collaborative learning partners, as their help repertoire is inadequate and even inappropriate. However, the technology has potential: children can master the multiple interfaces of toy and screen and, when the task requires it and the help provided is appropriate, they will both seek and use it. In particular, the cuddly interface experience can offer an advantage and the potential for fun interfaces that might address both the affective and the effective dimensions of learners' interactions...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{multimodal}} analysis of Japanese game card 47 Todofuken Obenkyo Karuta which means “ 47 Prefectures Learning Game Card”. This game card introduces the 47 prefectures in Japan {{through the use of}} the famous <b>animated</b> <b>icon,</b> Doraemon. Generally, this game card is used in schools in Japan for the purpose of teaching and learning, particularly among children. In Ambang Asuhan Jepun, University of Malaya, this game card is one of the teaching aids used to assist students to improve their Japanese language proficiency and their knowledge about the prefectures in Japan. The objective of this study are to identify and to describe the visual and textual elements in the Japanese game card 47 Todofuken Obenkyo Karuta. This study also looks at how the elements of visual and textual are combined in the game card to convey information for the purpose of teaching and learning. The main visual element of Doraemon is discussed from the perspective of its representation in the context of each prefecture, while the textual elements are analyzed in terms of their sentence meaning, sentence pattern and lexical choices. This study is carried out based on the compositional analysis theory developed in the framework of Visual Social Semiotics by Kress and van Leeuwen (1996, 2006). The elements in the game card are analyzed based on the 3 criteria of Information Value, Salience and Framing. In addition, to support the findings of the data analysis, a questionnaire is also conducted on a number of students in Ambang Asuhan Jepun which aims to obtain their perspective on the effectiveness of the use of Japanese game card 47 Todofuken Obenkyo Karuta as a teaching aid. Findings reveal that the visual and textual elements in Japanese game card 47 Todofuken Obenkyo Karuta are combined in an effective composition for the purpose ofteaching and learning, thus enables this game card to function as a suitable and effective teaching aid in Ambang Asuhan Jepun, University of Malaya to assist students to improve their knowledge about the prefectures in Japan. In addition to filling the existing research gap and contributing to the literature in the field of semiotics particularly multimodality, the implementation of this study has also responded to the suggestions from researchers and scholars for teachers to move from monomodal view in literacy to current pedagogical method based on multimodality, in which the implementation or application of multimodal method in pedagogy has been proven beneficial and effective in various fields...|$|E

In {{this paper}} we examine whether the {{formalization}} {{of changes in}} the spatial relations of two moving regions provides an adequate characteriza-tion of the conceptualization of perceived motion events of those regions. The changes we consider are topological transformations that result in gradual topo-logical changes.

Our experiments employ a group-ing paradigm and a custom made tool for presenting <b>animated</b> <b>icons.</b> The ex-periments are coupled with follow-up tasks to elaborate on the relation between conceptualizations—as revealed by the groupings—and different modalities of externalization such as language and graphics.

Each species has points that players can spend on adapting or evolving their creature populations, which are represented by <b>animated</b> <b>icons</b> of that creature. The more points a player spends on a field for a species, the quicker it evolves, becomes better at feeding (and grows its number faster), or better at fighting off predators. When a player evolves a creature, one can pick a population to be upgraded to the evolution one chooses. Each creature has a different set of evolution paths, and some can evolve into six or more different creatures. The world grows as the game advances, with land masses drifting and terrain shifting. As the player evolves the selected creatures, the player slowly advances in the complexity of the animals, eventually reaching intelligent life.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} formal topological characterization of spatial relations between moving geographic regions provides an adequate {{basis for the}} human conceptualization of motion events for those regions. The paper focuses on gradual changes in topological relationships caused by continuous transformations of the regions (specifically, translations). Using a series of experiments, the conceptualization and perception of conceptual neighborhoods is investigated. In particular, the role of conceptual neighborhoods in characterizing motion events is scrutinized. The experiments employ a grouping paradigm and a custom-made tool for presenting <b>animated</b> <b>icons.</b> The analysis examines whether paths through a conceptual neighborhood graph sufficiently characterize the conceptualization of the movement of two regions. The results of the experiments show that changes in topological relations—as detailed by paths through a conceptual neighborhood graph— are not sufficient to characterize the cognitive conceptualization of moving regions. The similarity ratings show clear effects of perceptually and conceptually induced groupings such as identity (which region is moving), reference (whether a larger or a smaller region is moving), and dynamics (whethe...|$|R
