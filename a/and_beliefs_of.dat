5|$|In 2005, Colbert left The Daily Show {{to host a}} {{spin-off}} series entitled The Colbert Report, {{a parody}} of personality-driven political pundit programs such as Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor that center largely on the personal views of their hosts. Because of this enlarged role, the personality <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the Stephen Colbert character have become more clearly defined {{over the course of}} the show, complete with a fictitious backstory that has been revealed piecemeal in short monologues accompanying a part of the program.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tales}} <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the Siberian Yupik people, killer whales {{are said to}} appear as wolves in winter, and wolves as killer whales in summer. Killer whales are {{believed}} to assist their hunters in driving walrus. Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, and a wooden carving hung from the hunter's belt. Small sacrifices such as tobacco are strewn into the sea for them. Killer whales were believed to have helped the hunters even when in wolf guise, by forcing reindeer to {{allow themselves to be}} killed.|$|E
5|$|Brahmashiva, {{the court}} poet of King Vikramaditya VI, earned the title Kavichakravarti ("Emperor among poets") from his patron for his writing Samayaparikshe ("Analysis of the doctrine", c.1125). In this {{philosophical}} writing, containing touches of propagandist satire and humor, the author seeks {{to prove the}} virtues of Jainism superior to all other contemporary religions. Brahmashiva portrays contemporary life <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> {{the people of the}} Kannada-speaking region. He criticises Hinduism and the conversion of a Jain temple originally dedicated to the Tirthankar Chandrapraba in Kholapur into a Hindu temple deifying the goddess Mahalakshmi. He expresses reservation regarding the existence of religious cosmopolitanism within a household where family members followed multiple faiths. The author is concerned about the eroding popularity of Jainism in southern India due to the rising popularity of the Veerashaiva movement. Prince Kirtivarma, a younger brother of King Vikramaditya VI, wrote Govaidya ("Cattle Medicine"), the earliest available writing in Kannada on veterinary science, which mixes medicine and magic.|$|E

5|$|Early Philippine {{sculpture}} {{is characterized}} by frontal nudity. One of the earliest forms are the bulols by the Ifugao people which serve as an assurance for bountiful harvests. The original function of these sculptures {{are related to the}} ceremonies <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the tribes who created them. Arab and Russian missionaries also brought beveled type of carvings in the form of Okkil. The beginnings of this sculpture type started with the Islamization of Sulu. The Spanish colonization of the country did not hinder Filipinos creating sculptures for objects of adoration. During this time, sculptures of deities and saints were used to teach Filipinos Christian doctrines. During the American colonialism, worshippers of faith were not discouraged to sculpt in order to adorn churches. Filipinos' first exposure to painting happened when Spain conquered the Philippines and these were used as religious propaganda often displayed in churches. However, as education progressed and wealth increased, more and more artists started to shift from the traditional religious motifs to a more secular pattern of imagery.|$|E
5|$|In June 1904, Beilhart {{invited the}} public to an 'open house' where he {{attempted}} to explain the motives <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the society. Over 400 people attended the gathering. Among them, it has been claimed, were Clarence Darrow and Elbert Hubbard but {{this has not been}} documented, although Beilhart is known to have visited Hubbard in East Aurora and Darrow was a frequent visitor to the society during the Chicago and Ingleside years. In the end, the society's rejection of marriage {{on the grounds that it}} made a 'slave of the woman', and the misinterpretations of their views on free-love were too much for the people of Lisbon to accept. In late 1904, the group left Lisbon for Chicago, in the hope that their progressive ideas might be better tolerated there.|$|E
5|$|Murli Prasad Sharma alias Munna Bhai (Sanjay Dutt), {{a gangster}} {{who is in}} love with the voice of Janhavi (Vidya Balan), a radio jockey, devises a plan to meet her when she announces a quiz contest {{featuring}} the life <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> Mahatma Gandhi, to be aired on 2 October, the birthday of Gandhi. To prepare for the contest, Munna's sidekick Circuit (Arshad Warsi) kidnaps and bribes a group of professors to provide the answers for Munna. After winning the contest, Munna is granted an interview with Janhavi wherein he presents himself as a professor of history and a Gandhi specialist. Janhavi subsequently asks Munna to present a lecture on Gandhi to a community of senior citizens who live in her home, called the 'Second Innings House.' To prepare for this event, Munna engages in intense study at a Gandhi institute. For three days and nights (and without food or sleep), Munna reads about the life and ideologies of Gandhi.|$|E

40|$|Communication {{protocols}} can {{be analyzed}} from different perspectives. From the perspective of Process Theory, communicative actions are synchronization links between processes. From the perspective of Dynamic Epistemic Logic, communicative actions are maps from the states <b>of</b> knowledge <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> agents before the communication to the states <b>of</b> knowledge <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> the agents after it. Security protocols are communication protocols that are specifically intended to guarantee so-called security requirements, like anonymity of participants, secrecy of messages, etc. Some of these requirements can be formalized naturally in epistemic terms. In Multi-Party Protocols, more than two parties engage in a group communication trying to achieve a common goal, like anonymous broadcast, secret sharing, fair exchange, electronic voting and mutual authentication...|$|R

25|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} of the Romans from southern Britain after 410, the remaining population slowly adopted the language, customs <b>and</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the Germanic Angles, Saxons and Jutes. Much of the process may have been due to cultural appropriation, as there was a widespread migration into Britain. The people who arrived may have been relatively small in numbers and aggressive towards the local populations they encountered.|$|E

25|$|Elements of pre-Han Dynasty mythologies such {{as those}} in Shan Hai Jing were adapted into these belief systems as they {{developed}} (in the case of Taoism), or were assimilated into Chinese culture (in the case of Buddhism).
