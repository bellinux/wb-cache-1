As against the <b>actual</b> <b>income</b> tax rate of 5% {{on the value of}} bonus shares, the government has told the IMF that it levied a 10% tax, which will generate revenue equal to 0.1% of gross domestic product or Rs. 29billion. On 27 March 2016, around 2,000 far-right protesters led by Sunni Tehreek staged a sit-in at D-Chowk in front of the parliament in Islamabad, causing a partial halt to the capital city. The protestors demanded the implementation of Sharia in the country and declaring Mumtaz Qadri a martyr. The protestors also burned down cars and city main public transit station and injured journalists and bystanders. The government on the 28th called in the army to control the law and order. By 29th the crowd had shrunk to 700 protestors, however the government remained reluctant to use force against the protesters. On 30 March 2016, the protesters ended their protest after government assured not to amend in blasphemy laws. On 7 April 2016, The Express Tribune in an editorial claimed that Sharif's multibillion-rupee health insurance plan seems to be failing already because of poor planning, claiming that the basic health infrastructure doesn't allow for such a plan.|$|E

2500|$|Constant {{variance}} (a.k.a. homoscedasticity). [...] This {{means that}} different {{values of the}} response variable have the same variance in their errors, regardless {{of the values of}} the predictor variables. In practice this assumption is invalid (i.e. the errors are heteroscedastic) if the response variable can vary over a wide scale. In order to check for heterogeneous error variance, or when a pattern of residuals violates model assumptions of homoscedasticity (error is equally variable around the 'best-fitting line' for all points of x), it is prudent to look for a [...] "fanning effect" [...] between residual error and predicted values. This is to say there will be a systematic change in the absolute or squared residuals when plotted against the predictive variables. Errors will not be evenly distributed across the regression line. Heteroscedasticity will result in the averaging over of distinguishable variances around the points to get a single variance that is inaccurately representing all the variances of the line. In effect, residuals appear clustered and spread apart on their predicted plots for larger and smaller values for points along the linear regression line, and the mean squared error for the model will be wrong. Typically, for example, a response variable whose mean is large will have a greater variance than one whose mean is small. For example, a given person whose income is predicted to be $100,000 may easily have an <b>actual</b> <b>income</b> of $80,000 or $120,000 (a standard deviation of around $20,000), while another person with a predicted income of $10,000 is unlikely to have the same $20,000 standard deviation, which would imply their <b>actual</b> <b>income</b> would vary anywhere between -$10,000 and $30,000. (In fact, as this shows, in many cases—often the same cases where the assumption of normally distributed errors fails—the variance or standard deviation should be predicted to be proportional to the mean, rather than constant.) Simple linear regression estimation methods give less precise parameter estimates and misleading inferential quantities such as standard errors when substantial heteroscedasticity is present. However, various estimation techniques (e.g. weighted least squares and heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors) can handle heteroscedasticity in a quite general way. Bayesian linear regression techniques can also be used when the variance is assumed to be a function of the mean. It is also possible in some cases to fix the problem by applying a transformation to the response variable (e.g. fit the logarithm of the response variable using a linear regression model, which implies that the response variable has a log-normal distribution rather than a normal distribution).|$|E
2500|$|His mother Anne's {{death in}} 1438 {{transformed}} his fiscal position. His inheritance from her included {{the remainder of}} his father's estates, which were worth about £1,500, and his mother's half of the Bohun inheritance of around another £1,200. The latter also included the earldom of Buckingham, which brought a further £1,000, and {{made him one of the}} greatest landowners in England. [...] "His landed resources matched his titles" [...] explained Albert Compton-Reves, scattered as they were throughout England, Wales and Ireland. In fact, it is likely that only the King, and the Duke of York were wealthier in the kingdom. One assessment of his estates suggests that, by the late 1440s, his income was over £5,000 per annum, and K.B. McFarlane estimated Stafford's total potential income from land to have been £6,300 gross annually, at its peak between 1447 and 1448. On the other hand, it is also possible that the <b>actual</b> <b>income</b> yielded from them could have been as low as £3,700, In any case, it is likely that, on average, he annually overspent by approximately £300. [...] Exacerbating this, for Stafford, was that rents owed to him were not always paid: even a lord of the status of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, for example, owed Buckingham over £100 in unpaid rent for the manor of Drayton Bassett in 1458. In the 1440s and 1450s, Buckingham's Welsh estates were particularly notable for both their rent arrears and public disorder.|$|E

60|$|Violet {{was always}} the better for an affectionate scolding, and went to bed, trusting that Arthur's {{disappointment}} might wear off with the night. But his aunt's inheritance had been too much the hope of his life, {{for him to be}} without a strong sense of injury, and his embarrassments made the loss a most serious matter. He applied to his father for an increase of allowance, but he could not have chosen a worse time; Lord Martindale had just advanced money for the purchase of his company, and could so ill afford to supply him as before, that but {{for the sake of his}} family, he would have withdrawn part of his <b>actual</b> <b>income.</b> So, all he obtained was a lecture on extravagance and neglect of his wife and children; and thus rendered still more sullen, he became impatient to escape from these grave looks and reproofs, and to return to town before the disclosure of Mr. Gardner's courtship. He made it his pretext that Violet was unwell and overworked in the general service; and she was, in truth, looking very ill and harassed; but he was far more the cause than were her exertions, and it was a great mortification to be removed from his parents and sister when, for the first time, she found herself useful to them, and for such an ungracious reason too, just when they were so much drawn together by the dangers they had shared, and the children seemed to be making progress in their grandmother's affections.

60|$|He had {{at least}} been very honest in the {{description}} he had given of his own circumstances to the lady whom he intended to marry. He had told her the exact truth; and though she, with all her cleverness, {{had not been able}} to realise the facts when related to her so suddenly, still enough had been said to make it quite clear that, when details of business should hereafter be discussed in a less hurried manner, he would be able to say that he had explained all his circumstances before he had made his offer. And he had been careful, too, as to her affairs. He had ascertained that her late husband had certainly settled upon her for life an estate worth four thousand a year. He knew, also, that eight thousand pounds had been left her, but of that he took no account. It might be probable that she had spent it. If any of it were left, it would be a godsend. Lord Fawn thought a great deal about money. Being a poor man, filling a place fit only for rich men, he had been driven to think of money, and had become self-denying and parsimonious,--perhaps we may say hungry and close-fisted. Such a condition of character is the natural consequence of such a position. There is, probably, no man who becomes naturally so hard in regard to money as he who is bound to live among rich men, who is not rich himself, and who is yet honest. The weight of the work of life in these circumstances is so crushing, requires such continued thought, and makes itself so continually felt, that the mind of the sufferer is never free from the contamination of sixpences. Of such a one it is not fair to judge as of other men with similar incomes. Lord Fawn had declared to his future bride that he had half five thousand a year to spend,--or the half, rather, of such <b>actual</b> <b>income</b> as might be got in from an estate presumed to give five thousand a year,--and it may be said that an unmarried gentleman ought not to be poor with such an income. But Lord Fawn unfortunately was a lord, unfortunately was a landlord, unfortunately was an Irish landlord. Let him be as careful as he might with his sixpences, his pounds would fly from him, or, as might, perhaps, be better said, could not be made to fly to him. He was very careful with his sixpences, and was always thinking, not exactly how he might make two ends meet, but how to reconcile the strictest personal economy with the proper bearing of an English nobleman.|$|E

Using a unique panel of data, we relate physicians' reference and <b>actual</b> <b>incomes</b> to their subsequent income growth. Reference income has a strong positive effect on subsequent income for physicians who are below their reference points, but not for physicians who are at or above their reference points. Loss aversion, which posits a kink in utility at the reference point, explains this puzzling pattern. Physicians respond strongly to shortfalls from the reference point-they take unappealing actions to boost earnings-because the marginal utility of income is steep in that range.

However, this result does not necessarily hold when aversion to income fluctuations is introduced. Furthermore, when <b>actual</b> <b>incomes</b> are replaced by expected incomes (conditional on an initial period), using a model of income dynamics, higher values of inequality over longer periods are typically found, although comparisons depend on inequality and variability aversion parameters.
