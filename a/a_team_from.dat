5|$|The initial {{mission to}} move a {{metallic}} disc {{from one side of}} an arena to another with a completely autonomous flying robot was seen by many as almost impossible. The college teams continued to improve their entries {{over the next two years}} when the competition saw its first autonomous takeoff, flight, and landing by <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>from</b> the Georgia Institute of Technology. Three years later in 1995 <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>from</b> Stanford University was able to acquire a single disk and move it from one side of the arena to the other in a fully autonomous flight—half a decade earlier than some pundits had predicted.|$|E

5|$|A fifth-place {{finish in}} the Premier League in 2004–05 meant Liverpool were not {{guaranteed}} entry into the Champions League, and faced the prospect {{of not being able}} to defend their European title. UEFA eventually ruled that they would be allowed to do so, but would be required to start in the first qualifying round, with no country protection, meaning they could face <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>from</b> England in the group stages. This turned out to be the case—Liverpool advanced through three qualifying rounds and were drawn with Chelsea in the group stages. They progressed from their group as winners but were beaten by Benfica in the first knock-out round.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>team</b> <b>from</b> Argonne was on {{hand for}} {{powering}} up the first reactor at the Hanford Site, where large reactors would produce plutonium for bombs. They watched the reactor in shifts, with John Marshall {{and others on the}} day shift, Enrico Fermi and Leona Marshall on the night shift, ending at midnight, and Don Hughes and John Wheeler on the swing shift. While the Marshalls were babysitting the reactor in Hanford, they left Peter with Leona's mother.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>team</b> <b>from</b> the Keck Observatory in Hawaii {{announced}} in 2006 {{that it had}} measured {{the density of the}} binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being less than that of water ice (0.8g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice with a layer of dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480g/cm3) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus. Such a difference in densities suggests that density may not be a good indicator of asteroid origin.|$|E

5|$|Curling is a {{team sport}} that is contested at the Winter Olympic Games. A men's tournament {{was held at the}} 1924 Winter Olympics before the sport was removed from the {{official}} programme until the 1998 Games. For 82years, the 1924 tournament was considered a demonstration sport, so the medals were not officially counted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The tournament was won by <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>from</b> the Royal Caledonian Curling Club in Scotland, who represented Great Britain. In 2006, Scottish newspaper The Herald conducted an investigation that found evidence that curling {{had been part of the}} official programme. The IOC subsequently recognized the top three teams as full medal winners.|$|E

5|$|In 2008 <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>from</b> Calvin College {{examined}} the light curves of a debiased sample of ten Jupiter trojans, {{and found a}} median spin period of 18.9 hours. This value {{was significantly higher than}} that for main-belt asteroids of similar size (11.5 hours). The difference could mean that the Jupiter trojans possess a lower average density, which may imply that they formed in the Kuiper belt (see below).|$|E
5|$|In 2010, <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>from</b> New York {{described}} {{detection of}} PrPSc even when initially present at {{only one part}} in a hundred billion (10−11) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrPSc. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrPSc, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a micro-capillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus {{so that it is}} totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>from</b> the University of Cambridge began {{conducting}} {{a study in}} a short, double track section of unused tunnel near the platforms where a newly built tunnel for Crossrail is situated almost two metres beneath.
