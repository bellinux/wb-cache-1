In some cases, signers of the statement grew more radical in their beliefs after being reprimanded by church authority. In the publicity surrounding the dispute with the nuns and the theologians, the statistics showing that most <b>American</b> <b>Catholics</b> disagreed with church teachings about abortion were repeated many times. Traxler appeared in a television spot with a tube of toothpaste, saying that you cannot put the toothpaste back in the tube.

40|$|The {{history of}} <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> biblical {{scholarship}} {{is all but}} ignored, with only Gerald P. Fogarty 2 ̆ 7 s <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> Biblical Scholarship (1989) devoted to this subject. Most scholars assume that <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> exegesis was mired in an ahistorical, anti-critical mode prior to Divino Afflante Spiritu (1943), a papal encyclical which is called the 2 ̆ 2 Magna Carta 2 ̆ 2 of biblical scholarship because it encouraged the use of historical criticism. Further, it is supposed that the little exegesis which did appear was simply a derivative of European <b>Catholic</b> scholarship. Thus <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> biblical scholarship is seen as having little history worth recounting before Divino. This study argues that an in-depth engagement with the actual exegesis of <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> New Testament scholarship prior to Divino demonstrates that the above is a caricature. Instead, <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> NT scholarship was pluralistic and critical in this period. Using a publication proliferation scale {{as the basis for}} selecting the exegetes studied, it is shown that three separate approaches existed in <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> NT scholarship. These three approaches exhibit distinct alignments of various methodological, exegetical, and theological elements and can be classified as paradigms. These three paradigms correlate with specific social strategies adopted by Catholics as they confronted an environment dominated by Protestantism. <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> NT exegesis was heavily apologetical in reaction to Protestant scholarship, but it was not anti-critical. <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> NT scholarship, in particular, rejected the common Protestant understandings of the Kingdom of God as an eschatological or moral reality. Instead, <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> exegetes pictured Jesus 2 ̆ 7 fundamental work as the founding of an institution [...] the Church [...] which would continue his soteriological function. They especially explained Jesus 2 ̆ 7 parables on the kingdom as ecclesiological teaching. Jesus 2 ̆ 7 mission and message was fundamentally ecclesiological in the <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> frame of reference. Drawing heavily upon the agricultural images in the parables, this interpretation saw the Kingdom [...] and therefore of the Church [...] as an organic, unfolding institution. This reading necessitated the embrace of a developmental model of history. In this way, <b>American</b> <b>Catholic</b> NT scholarship was prepared for the directions outlined by Divino, as well as found a means by which to engage modern Protestant exegesis without abandoning core Catholic convictions...|$|R
