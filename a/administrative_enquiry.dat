25|$|Of course, {{if in the}} {{exercise}} of his discretion under s 6FA the Commissioner imposed a condition that had no reasonable connection with his function under the Act or the Letters Patent, that would not be a valid exercise of power. To take an extreme example, a direction that leave to cross-examine would not be granted unless an applicant made a donation to a political party would be plainly invalid. But par 12 on its face seems rationally and reasonably related to the efficient performance of the obligations of the Commissioner. Paragraph 12 is a means of ascertaining whether or not an applicant has demonstrated a sufficient interest in challenging the evidence of a particular witness. Further, a statement under par 12 will alert the Commissioner and all others concerned as to the true extent of factual disputes and thus promote the efficient resolution of those disputes. In a large and complex <b>administrative</b> <b>enquiry</b> where there is no equivalent to the pleadings and particulars used in civil litigation, the par 12 procedure has an obvious utility.|$|E

40|$|A Master's Dissertation, {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Arts degree of Loughborough University. This research set out to monitor the information activities of selected public and special libraries in the UK. An independent researcher collected enquiry data at seven different information services (two public reference libraries, two public lending libraries, a tourist information centre and two special libraries). This data was then categorised according to length of answer, mode of enquiring, type of enquiry and subject of enquiry. The sources used in answering and their formats were also examined. Results for each case study were considered separately. Across library comparisons could be made too, as {{the data was collected}} in a consistent manner. This is unlike the statistics kept by individual libraries. Findings were that the special libraries had longer enquiries and received more by telephone, fax and letter than the public libraries. Furthermore, they made the most use of computerised sources. Business and commerce enquiries were most frequently asked at the public reference libraries. Answering community information and children's enquiries were common tasks at the public lending libraries. Minimal overlap occurred in the provision of tourist information. Finally, it was observed that many directional and <b>administrative</b> <b>enquiries</b> were asked at the various cases studied...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 64 year-old {{moderately}} hypertensive patient investigated for dyspnoea on exertion with no chest pain. After informing the patient, an ergometric test following a gentle protocol was performed, according to the French Society of Cardiology guidelines. At the peak of effort the patient developed a sudden left hemiplegia with a right capsulo-thalamic haematoma on cranial CT. No other case has been described and a literature search showed no relationship between physical effort and cerebral haematoma. Following an <b>administrative</b> tribunal <b>enquiry,</b> no medical fault was attributed regarding the indication and performing the test; no failure to inform could be established for a risk that was unknown {{at the time of the}} test...|$|R

He has been in charge of planning and constructing Charles de Gaulle Airport (Roissy) in Paris since 1967. On 23 May 2004 a portion of Terminal 2E collapsed, killing four people. Terminal 2E, inaugurated in 2003, is the seventh terminal at Roissy by Andreu, and has been described as one of Andreu's boldest designs. The collapse was attributed by the ad hoc <b>administrative</b> <b>enquiry</b> commission to a variety of technical causes and the lack of margins of safety in the design. Andreu blamed the collapse on poor execution by the building companies.|$|E
