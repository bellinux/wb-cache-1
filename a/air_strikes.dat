She then protected the carriers during <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> against the Central Philippines to neutralize enemy air power for the long-awaited invasion of the Philippines. On 10 October, Iowa arrived off Okinawa for a series of <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> on the Ryukyu Islands and Formosa.

5|$|After {{the events}} at Srebrenica, sixteen nations {{met at the}} London Conference, which began on 21 July 1995, to {{consider}} new options for Bosnia. As {{a result of the}} conference, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali gave General Bernard Janvier, the UN military commander, the authority to request NATO airstrikes without consulting civilian UN officials. The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top political body, and the UN also agreed to use NATO <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> in response to attacks on any of the other safe areas in Bosnia. The participants at the conference also agreed in principle to the use of large-scale NATO <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> in response to future acts of Serb aggression.|$|E

5|$|On 28 August 1995, {{a mortar}} shell {{slammed into a}} Sarajevo marketplace, killing 37 people. The United States {{subsequently}} blamed Bosnian Serb forces for the attack. Admiral Leighton Smith, the NATO commander, recommended that NATO launch retaliatory <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> against the Serbs under the plan established for Operation Deliberate Force. On 30 August 1995, NATO officially launched Operation Deliberate Force with large-scale bombing of Serb targets. This bombing superseded Operation Deny Flight's role for <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> and close air support, but Deny Flight remained an active operation, still enforcing the no-fly zone over Bosnia.|$|E

5|$|In August 1964, as {{a result}} of the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, in which U.S. naval vessels claimed to have been {{attacked}} by North Vietnamese patrol boats, President Johnson ordered retaliatory <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> (Operation Pierce Arrow) launched against the north. This did not, however, satisfy the military chiefs, who demanded a wider and more aggressive campaign.|$|E

The United States and other Western countries blamed the Syrian government for the attacks, while Syria blamed civil war opposition forces. In response to Ghouta, a coalition of countries led by the United States and France, which support the rebels, threatened <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> on Syria. Russia, a key ally of Syria, along with China had earlier blocked efforts by the United States, France, and the UK to secure United Nations Security Council approval for military intervention. The United States and France headed a coalition of countries on the verge of carrying out <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> on Syria.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June, {{helicopter}} gunships conducted dawn <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> against insurgents {{who were}} attacking troops {{at the university}} campus. By this point, the city had been coming under continuous <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> for three days, which included barrel bombs. An all-out ground offensive was launched during the day {{in an attempt to}} capture the city. A column of troops started out from Samarra towards Tikrit to the north and by sundown had reached the edge of the city. According to Lt. Gen. Ahmed Abu Ragheef, another column was directed towards the Camp Speicher air base. There were initial claims by government sources of capturing Tikrit, but in fact Tikrit itself remained under insurgent control as heavy fighting continued to rage on the city outskirts during the night. In the evening, helicopters struck a gathering of people preparing for a wedding ceremony in the village of Al Bu Hayazi, east of Tikrit, killing four civilians.|$|E

The game is menu-based and only allows the player to use four command functions; move, attack, land and pass. Depending on the difficulty set, the game lasts 32 to 36 turns and can only be won by eliminating all Japanese forces from the island before the final turn ends. During the game, the enemy may fortify their positions, launch <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> against the United States Navy fleet or may perform suicide attacks if their unit is about to be wiped out.

5|$|When news of {{the attack}} on Camp Holloway reached Saigon on the morning of 7 February 1965, General William Westmoreland, McGeorge Bundy and Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, flew out to Pleiku to survey the damage. Bundy then called President Johnson to put forward the MACV's request for retaliatory <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> against North Vietnam. In {{response}} to Bundy's request, Johnson hastily convened a session of the National Security Council, which involved the speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate majority leader, to discuss the need for reprisal against the Communists in Vietnam. That afternoon, General Nguyễn Khánh arrived in Pleiku to meet with Westmoreland and Bundy, and they both informed him that recommendations for <b>air</b> <b>strikes</b> against North Vietnam had been made to the President of the United States.|$|E
