500|$|In 1998, on {{learning}} of {{his interest in}} pursuing a political career, the National Party president John Slater began working actively to recruit him. Former party leader Jenny Shipley describes {{him as one of}} the people she [...] "deliberately sought out <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> head on the line–either privately or publicly–to get them in there".|$|E
500|$|... "And then Mary J. Blige sang it. And then he {{took her}} vocal off it, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> vocal back on, my demo vocal, without asking and {{released}} it. And I never even knew it was gonna happen, and I was really upset. Because I had just retired, I {{was trying to be}} a pop songwriter, not an artist." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{she looks}} at me so pitiful that I goes up to her <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>my</b> arm round her and pats her on the back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, if you {{are going}} to talk poetry," [...] said Jill, [...] "I'll leave you. Anyhow, I ought to be getting below <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> things together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Catherine, {{why are you}} crying, love?' I asked, {{approaching}} <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> {{arm over}} her shoulder. 'You mustn't cry because papa has a cold; be thankful it is nothing worse.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Regarding {{agreeing to}} play at Live 8, he said: [...] "There {{was more than one}} reason, firstly to support the cause. The second one is the energy-consuming and uncomfortable {{relationship}} between Roger and me that I was carrying along in my heart. That is why we wanted to perform and to leave the trash behind. Thirdly, I might have regretted it if I declined." [...] On 20 February 2006, Gilmour commented again on Pink Floyd's future when he was interviewed by Billboard.com, stating, [...] "Who knows? I have no plans at all to do that. My plans are to do my concerts <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> solo record out." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I want {{to explain}} what happened. Sunday night when you {{requested}} to have someone over I didn't realize you wanted the room in private. I went to Molly's room and I was showing her how I set up my computer so I can access it from anywhere. I turned on my camera and saw you {{in the corner of}} the screen and I immediately closed it. I felt uncomfortable and guilty of what happened. Obviously I told people what occurred so they could give me advice. Then Tuesday when you requested the room again I wanted to make sure what happened Sunday wouldn't happen again and not to video chat me from 930 to 12. Just in case, I turned my camera away <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> computer to sleep so even if anyone tried it wouldn't work. I wanted to make amends for Sunday night. I'm sorry if you heard something distorted and disturbing but I assure you all my actions were good natured." ...|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, I beseeched the Lord {{to teach}} me His statutes. After my prayer as usual I opened my Bible with closed eyes <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> finger on the right place. For the first time I opened Revelation 1:3"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand." [...] I asked the Lord: [...] "O Lord! What about until then?" [...] And again I opened the Bible, that time on 1 Timothy 1:15"This is a {{faithful}} saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus {{came into the world}} to save sinners; of whom I am chief." [...] And for the third time I tempted the Lord, saying: [...] "O Lord! I am not an Abraham nor a Jew, I'm a sinner, but involve me to understand Your Will." [...] And then I opened the Book of SirahJoshua 24:29-30, where I read in the new American Translation: [...] "Said to myself, I will water my plants, my flower bed I will drench; and suddenly this rivulet of mine became a river, then this stream of mine, a sea. Thus do I send my teaching forth shining like a dawn, to become known afar off. Thus do I pour out instruction like prophecy and bestow it on generations to come." ...|$|E
60|$|I now raised {{myself on}} <b>my</b> elbow, <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> hand to my forehead, {{found that it}} had been cut pretty severely, and that I had lost a good deal of blood.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I {{would have}} nothing to say to it. Look you, I stood here, <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> hand upon my heart--for he bade me to do that--I said that I could not love him." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I Said <b>My</b> Pajamas (<b>and</b> <b>Put</b> on <b>My</b> Pray'rs)" [...] (co-written with George Wyle) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll go <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> {{head under}} the shower. I oughtn't to have had that last cocktail. It's always the last one that does you in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I {{had better}} go home," [...] said Mrs. Robarts. [...] "I will go <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> things up, and then I will send James for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose they}} will set about {{rebuilding}} {{the church at}} once," [...] said Cecil. [...] "Of course they will form a committee, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> husband on it." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I Said <b>My</b> Pajamas (<b>and</b> <b>Put</b> on <b>My</b> Pray'rs)" [...] is {{a popular}} song.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could do}} nothing. I did not remain upon the spot another minute, but hurried {{home to the}} castle. As I rapidly walked on I felt the dog beside me, <b>and,</b> <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> hand upon him, I {{felt that he was}} panting terribly. For three days I did not leave the house.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I fretted and fumed {{all next}} day, {{and raised a}} great disturbance,' rejoined the old gentleman. 'At last I got tired of {{rendering}} myself unpleasant and making everybody miserable; so I hired a carriage at Muggleton, <b>and,</b> <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> own horses in it, came up to town, under pretence of bringing Emily to see Arabella.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How!" [...] exclaimed the Dey, [...] "dost {{mean to tell}} me that thou couldst {{really do}} as that {{shoemaker}} did, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> guards to sleep before mine eyes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And the gazelle answered: 'Can I {{take those}} {{soldiers}} to go <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> master to shame as he lies there naked? I am enough by myself, my lord.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{looked again}} into the kitchen; then I {{returned}} <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> hands on Robina's shoulders. [...] "It is a most amusing incident--as it has turned out," [...] I said.|$|E
6000|$|... "But with me such {{associations}} and veneration are riveted the stronger by seeing the places, <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> hand upon the spots. I {{do not speak}} of that fictitious marble slab up there; but here, among the sandhills by this river, and at the Mount of Olives over which we passed, I do believe." ...|$|R
60|$|She led me {{away and}} I undressed and washed myself <b>and</b> <b>put</b> on <b>my</b> Sunday clothes.|$|R
60|$|She {{thanked me}} {{presently}} for <b>my</b> telegram, <b>and</b> I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> arm {{about her and}} drew her into the living room.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{happened}} a fortnight since. Only yesterday, she broke out again, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> affection {{for her to}} a far more severe trial. I have not got over it yet.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{not going}} to marry her now!" [...] {{interposed}} Mrs. Baggs, indignantly. [...] "Bear witness, indeed! I won't bear witness till I've taken off my bonnet, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> hair tidy!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said I, [...] "and I {{might have}} gone down cellar <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> head in the cold-air box of the furnace. But there wouldn't have been much fun in that." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was in 1868, when {{nine years}} old or thereabouts, that while looking at a map of Africa of the time <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> finger on the blank space then {{representing}} the unsolved mystery of that continent, I said to myself with absolute assurance and an amazing audacity which {{are no longer in}} my character now: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Especially {{among young}} ladies," [...] said Meta. [...] "I hear {{so much of}} what girls would do, if they might, or could, that I long to see them like Ethel--do what they can. And then it strikes me that I am doing the same, living {{wilfully}} in indulgence, <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> trust in my own misgivings and discontent." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} help feeling for a certain half of a sixpence that you have heard me speak of; <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> hand {{mechanically}} upon my chest, I tore my fingers with the point of my new DIAMOND-PIN. Mr. Polonius had sent it home the night before, and I sported {{it for the first}} time at Roundhand's to dinner.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't want {{details about}} that, do you? Thanks. The old eloquence {{had come back}} all right. I led her under a cocoanut palm <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> old verbal spell on her again.|$|E
6000|$|I leant across <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> {{arms around}} him; I {{suppose it was}} un-English; {{there are times when}} one forgets these points. [...] "I did not know! I did not know," [...] I cried.|$|E
6000|$|... "Man of the Mountains," [...] said Nod presently, [...] "would {{you hold}} me if I crept close <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> {{head over the}} edge? I {{would like to see}} how many Mulgars-deep we walk." ...|$|E
60|$|Finally it came {{half past}} eight, <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> on <b>my</b> hat, I started for Mr. Woodward's residence.|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] {{retorted}} I, [...] "you {{forget that}} I am particularly careful. I always carry my piece on half-cock, <b>and</b> never <b>put</b> <b>my</b> {{finger on the}} trigger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush, Jonathan," [...] said I; [...] "there's the First Duff looking up. Be still! the Emperor {{will hear}} you;" [...] <b>and</b> I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> {{hand on his}} mouth.|$|R
