5|$|In the 18th century, coffee <b>and</b> <b>chop</b> {{houses were}} {{established}} on the street; Twinings was established at No.206 in 1706 by Thomas Twining, supplier of tea to Queen Anne. The company {{claims to be}} the oldest ratepayer in Westminster. The Grecian Coffee House ran from around 1702 to 1803, while Tom's ran from 1706 to around 1775. Though these premises were well-known, the alleyways around the Strand were regular haunts for pickpockets and prostitutes during this time. The Rose Tavern, at the eastern end of the street, was frequented by lawyers during the 18th century. It was later demolished and became Thanet Place. The Crown and Anchor was the main meeting place for the Catholic Association and helped established the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. It was later used for Catholic politicians such as Daniel O'Connell to address constituents. The original premises burned down in 1854, but was rebuilt. Simpson's-in-the-Strand originally started at No.100 in 1828 as a smoking and dining club. It later became a restaurant. The Strand was also notable in the 18th century as a centre for the British book trade, with numerous printers and publishers along the street. The prominent bookseller Andrew Millar is an example {{of one of the most}} successful publishers who owned a shop there.|$|E
25|$|In 1828, {{there were}} three {{manufacturers}} and 460 workshops. The first factories were established in the 1840s (sugar and nail factories). The first telegram message arrived in 1856 and the railway connected the city to Miskolc in 1860. In 1873, there were already connections to Prešov, Žilina, <b>and</b> <b>Chop</b> (in today's Ukraine). The city gained a public transit system in 1891 when track was laid down for a horse-drawn tramway. The traction was electrified in 1914. In 1906, Francis II Rákóczi's house of Rodosto was reproduced in Košice and his remains were buried in the St. Elisabeth Cathedral.|$|E
25|$|Cleveland's Chinatown {{was largely}} {{confined}} to Rockwell Avenue between E. 21st and E. 24th Streets. On Leong Tong, a merchant association, which had began construction on its new building at 2138-2136 Rockwell Avenue in 1926, formally opened its retail, office, and residential space on January 4, 1931. This two-story structure contained ground-floor retail and restaurant space and second-story office and residential units. The enclave thrived in the 1930s, as popular and now-locally famous restaurants like Shanghai Restaurant (which opened in 1931), Red Dragon Café (which opened in 1932), and Golden Gate (which opened in 1933) drew {{large numbers of}} white Americans. Dishes such as chow mein <b>and</b> <b>chop</b> suey, which had taste and texture similar to Western European cooking, were mainstays of these establishments. Most Chinatown restaurants stayed open until 4 A.M. on weekends.|$|E

25|$|Donte Perkins, {{better known}} by his stage name Tae Beast is an American record {{producer}} from Los Angeles, California. Beast is also {{one-half of the}} production team The Weirrd People, alongside Skhye Hutch. Tae Beast first got into producing records when his cousin and his cousin's friend showed him how to use an MP60 keyboard, and he would take his dad's old records <b>and</b> <b>chop</b> up samples along with playing the keyboard. Beast began his love for music in the '80s listening to old vinyl Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield records with his father, and continued in the 90's {{as he tried to}} loop tracks to make instrumentals on a karaoke machine. His love for the likes of J Dilla, RZA and Kanye West, {{just to name a few}} have begun to shape his sound as a soulful hip hop producer. Early in his career he had already worked with the likes of U-N-I, Jay Rock and Bad Lucc.|$|E
25|$|Campus Ministry runs several {{different}} retreat programs during the academic year. The Frosh Getaway, offered annually on a September weekend, {{is an opportunity}} for freshmen, led by sophomore leaders, to get to know their new classmates and to adjust to college life with a fun stress-free weekend. The Retreat on the Rock is designed as a college adaptation of Kairos-style retreats. The Fifth Week Retreat is intended as a follow-up to Kairos, Search, TEC, Retreat on the Rock, or similar style retreats, offering ample time for personal reflection and group discussion. The Busy Persons Retreat, offered annually in the spring, {{is an opportunity for}} spiritual guidance and reflection within the context and schedule demands of daily college life. The SuperNatural Christian's retreat is a six-day backpacking retreat in upper Michigan's Sylvania Wilderness Tract.

500|$|Lawrence's {{breakthrough}} role {{came in the}} small-scale drama Winter's Bone (2010), {{based on}} Daniel Woodrell's novel of the same name. In Debra Granik's independent feature, she portrayed Ree Dolly, a poverty-stricken teenager in the Ozark Mountains who cares for her mentally ill mother and younger siblings while searching for her missing father. Lawrence traveled to the Ozarks a week before filming began {{to live with the}} family on whom the story was based, and in preparation, she learned to fight, skin squirrels, <b>and</b> <b>chop</b> wood. David Denby of The New Yorker said the film [...] "would be unimaginable with anyone less charismatic", and Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "her performance is more than acting, it's a gathering storm. Lawrence's eyes are a roadmap to what's tearing Ree apart." [...] The production won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. The actress was awarded the National Board of Review Award for Breakthrough Performance, and with her first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, she became the second youngest person to be nominated in the category.|$|E

500|$|Over-hunting {{by humans}} {{has been one}} of the most widely {{accepted}} hypotheses for the ultimate demise of the subfossil lemurs. The extinctions and human hunting pressure are associated due to the synchronicity of human arrival and species decline, as well as the suspected naïveté of the Malagasy wildlife during the early encounters with human hunters. [...] Despite the assumptions, evidence of butchery has been minimal until recently, although folk memories of rituals associated with the killing of megafauna have been reported. [...] Archeological evidence for butchery of giant subfossil lemurs, including Palaeopropithecus ingens and Pachylemur insignis, was found on specimens from two sites in southwestern Madagascar, Taolambiby and Tsirave. [...] Although the bones had been collected in the early 20th century and lacked stratigraphic records, one of the bones with tool marks had been dated to the time of the first arrival of humans. [...] Tool-induced bone alterations, in the form of cuts <b>and</b> <b>chop</b> marks near joints and other characteristic cuts and fractures, indicated the early human settlers skinned, disarticulated, and filleted giant lemurs. [...] Prior to these finds, only modified bones of dwarf hippos and elephant birds, as well as giant aye-aye teeth, had been found.|$|E

They soon acquired an ethnically Chinese partner and cook, Harry Wong; Wong bought them out of the restaurant in 1937.
