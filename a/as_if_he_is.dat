5|$|Gurnemanz {{knows that}} the Grail draws only the pious to Monsalvat and invites the boy to observe the Grail rite. The youth {{does not know what}} the Grail is, but remarks that as they walk he seems to {{scarcely}} move, yet feels <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> traveling far. Gurnemanz says that in this realm time becomes space ("").|$|E
5|$|Satan preaches from {{a raised}} earth mound and {{is dressed in}} {{clerical}} clothing {{that may be a}} soutane. He has a goat-like beard and horns, and stands in silhouette, accentuating his heavy body and gaping mouth, which is depicted <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> screaming. His form may be derived from a 1652 illustration of the Canaanite idol Molech, as illustrated by Athanasius Kircher.|$|E
5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims {{who have been}} on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without any interest in the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, in the opinion of Kartini et al., it is <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E

25|$|In {{decision}} theory, the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem shows that, {{under certain}} axioms of rational behavior, a decision-maker faced with risky (probabilistic) outcomes of different choices will behave <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> maximizing the expected value of some function defined over the potential outcomes at some specified {{point in the}} future. This function {{is known as the}} von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function. The theorem is the basis for expected utility theory.|$|E
25|$|The radio operator's story continues: {{he finds}} himself in a garden home where he thinks he's been before. References abound linking Camões to the Irishman, who feels <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> being taken over by another. Later, his ship is {{attacked}} near Hong Kong by pirates and the crew abducted and taken deep into China, where he finds clothes containing gold coins— here, Camões and the Irishman merge.|$|E

60|$|I think, now, how odd it was, but how wonderfully like Mr. Micawber, that, when he {{went from}} London to Canterbury, he should have talked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> going to the {{farthest}} limits of the earth; and, {{when he went}} from England to Australia, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> going for a little trip across the channel.|$|R
25|$|Also, Cramer has National Football League yellow {{penalty and}} red coach's {{challenge}} flags that he throws whenever he believes a company has behaved unethically (penalty) {{or when he}} questions a stock decision (coach's challenge), respectively. He will also throw the flag when a caller unethically uses the national television audience to promote a stock for self-interest. If a caller rambles on about a stock, Cramer will {{lie down on the}} floor of the set with a pillow and blanket and act <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> going to sleep.|$|E
25|$|In 1801, Lockwood, {{a wealthy}} {{young man from}} the South of England who is seeking peace and recuperation, rents Thrushcross Grange in Yorkshire. He visits his landlord, Heathcliff, {{who lives in a}} remote moorland farmhouse, Wuthering Heights. There Lockwood finds an odd assemblage: Heathcliff who seems to be a gentleman, but his manners are uncouth; the {{reserved}} mistress of the house who is in her mid-teens; and a young man who seems {{to be a member of}} the family, yet dresses and speaks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a servant.|$|E
25|$|Each day Hilde visits Anton's grave mentally {{talking to}} him <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> still alive. One evening, as she is {{returning}} home, Hilde discovers that a black cat seems to be following her. The cat causes her to remember two distinct experiences from her past. The first is a memory from {{when she was a}} small child and had attempted to hide a stray cat in her bedroom. Her family was very poor and could not afford a pet, but she saved her table scraps for it anyway. One day as she was coming home, her father met her drunk in the doorway. After telling her he had snapped the cat's neck, he beat her harshly with a fly swatter. This first memory seeped into the second: her daughter, Erika, begging to keep a stray cat she had found. Anton had granted her wish, but the cat ruined the neighbors' gardens and Hilde was forced to drown it in the river.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah Berurah quotes three {{opinions}} regarding {{circumstances in}} which the fast may be broken. According to the first, a healthy individual must fast if he can sustain the fast without undue suffering and without any subsequent weakening that would affect his ability or inclination to heartily partake of his Passover Seder meal (and specifically the matzah). (If one is obligated to partake of a festive meal that day, such <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the father of an infant {{on the day of}} circumcision, this opinion requires him to undertake a reciprocal fast at the soonest opportunity.) According to the second custom (quoted by the Magen Avraham {{in the name of the}} Maharash Levi), the fast may be broken at any festive meal celebrating a circumcision or a redemption of the firstborn. According to the third custom, based upon the Maharshal (Yam Shel Sh'lomo, Bava Kamma 7:37), the fast may even be broken at a seudat mitzvah for a siyum celebrating the completion of study of a tractate of Talmud. The latter custom is commonly observed.|$|E
25|$|Acting <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{not bothered}} by Dr. Lee exiling him, Devon {{contacts}} A's rival school Morris Brown College, to discuss playing for their marching band next season. Mr. Wade, Brown's band leader, says that Devon {{does not need}} to know how to read music and will likely get a full scholarship and a good position on the drumline. When Wade wants to know what Dr. Lee is planning for the BET Big Southern Classic (a large competition of college bands), Devon realizes that his heart and honor are still with the A band. He rejects the scholarship offer from the rival band and returns to A Though Devon is still not playing for the band, he cannot give up his drumming. He is sent cassette tapes from his estranged father and gets some ideas for new drum arrangements. He and Sean have a final confrontation, with Sean telling Devon that he is A's best drummer but that the band is bigger than just one person; this clears the air and they begin to work together. The two present their idea for an entrance cadence to Dr. Lee who decides they will be used during the Classic. Devon helps the drumline prepare and patches up his relationship with Laila. Lee also tells Devon that he can guarantee him a full return to the band next year.|$|E
500|$|When McGuirk {{shows up}} at Brendon's house for the date that night, Brendon tries to scare him off by acting <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> his son, but it proves unsuccessful. During the date, Paula becomes {{agitated}} at McGuirk's inappropriate, boring subject matter, and she becomes drunk in order to entertain herself. Meanwhile, Brendon, Melissa, and their friend Jason film a scene from The Dark Side of the Law in Brendon's basement, where Brendon's character is in a French prison, confronted by his mother, played by Melissa. They stop filming when Jason's nose starts running, and he demonstrates how he can move the mucus up and down to their disgust.|$|E

500|$|News {{footage of}} then-President Bill Clinton was {{digitally}} altered {{to make it}} appear <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> speaking about alien contact. This was not the original plan for the film; Zemeckis had initially approached Sidney Poitier to play the president, but the actor turned the role down in favor of The Jackal. Shortly after Poitier's refusal, Zemeckis saw a NASA announcement in August 1996. [...] "Clinton gave his Mars rock speech," [...] the director explained, [...] "and I swear to God it was like it was scripted for this movie. When he said the line 'We will continue to listen closely to what it has to say,' I almost died. I stood there with my mouth hanging open." ...|$|E
500|$|The critic Michael Billington, {{writing in}} The Guardian, gave a mixed review: [...] "Once or twice one of Stoppard's brightly {{coloured}} balls {{falls to the}} ground, partly because Michael Hordern's moral philosopher substitutes academic mannerism for apprehension of the argument. But {{this is not to}} deny that Hordern's simian habit of scratching his left earlobe with right hand or leaning over his desk <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing intellectual press-ups is very funny to watch or that he is brilliant at displaying cuckolded curiosity." [...] Harold Hobson, the drama critic, thought that failing to enjoy the play was [...] "not actually a criminal offence but it is a sad evidence of illiteracy". Jumpers won the Evening Standard 's Best Play Award which, much to Hordern's amusement, was presented by the philosopher A. J. Ayer.|$|E
500|$|President Bill Clinton {{performed}} the song on saxophone during his appearance on The Arsenio Hall Show on June 3, 1992.

Paul McCartney, who participated in Uncuts poll stated, [...] "It's the way [...] sings it <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> singing from the depths of hell.

500|$|Mirella D’Ancona {{argues that}} the image {{reflects}} Michelangelo’s views on {{the roles of the}} members of the Holy Family in human salvation and the soul’s immortality. The Virgin’s placement and emphasis is due to her role in human salvation. She is both the mother of Christ and the best intercessor for appealing to him. Michelangelo, who had been strongly influenced by the Dominican Fra Girolamo Savonarola in Florence, is using the picture to defend the Maculist point of view, a philosophy of the Dominican order rejecting the idea of the Immaculate Conception of Mary. The Maculist view is that the Virgin did not receive her sanctification at birth but at the moment of the incarnation of Christ; thus, the image depicts the moment of Mary’s sanctification by showing the Christ Child blessing her. Michelangelo depicts Christ <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> growing out of Mary’s shoulder to take human form, one leg hanging limply and the other not visible at all, therefore making him a part of Mary. Moreover, his muscles and balance convey an upward movement, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> growing out of her, although he is above Mary, asserting his superiority to her. [...] Furthermore, she {{argues that the}} nudes are to be interpreted as sinners who have removed their clothes for cleansing and purification through baptism. The water, which separates the sinners from the Holy Family, just beyond the horizontal band in the middle of the painting, can therefore be seen as the “waters of separation” mentioned in the Bible. [...] She also argues that the five figures may represent the five parts of the soul: the higher soul (soul and intellect) on the left and the lower soul (imagination, sensation, and nourishing faculty) on the right, a visual depiction of the views of Marsilio Ficino, whom Michelangelo references in other works. [...] Additionally, in looking at them as separate groupings, she suggest that the two figures on Mary’s right represents the human and divine natures of Christ, while the three on her left represent the Trinity.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My Immortal" [...] begins with Lee {{sitting on a}} fountain. Her legs and arms are covered with bandage as she puts them in the water. She is wearing a long white dress and is seen walking around the fountain, {{surrounded}} by children and other people {{that appear to be}} unaware or indifferent to her presence and wearabouts. Shots of Moody follow, who appears to be sullen and withdrawn. He is wearing a suit and his feet are bare. His shoulders sag and his head slumps forward as he delicately plays piano, and he later picks up his jacket <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> about to leave. When the bridge starts, the band is shot performing in one room while Moody is in another, playing on the piano. Throughout the video, Lee is never filmed on ground level. She walks along the ledge of a fountain, sits in a tree and sings lying on top of a building. She also lies atop scaffolding and on the hood of a car surrounded with leaves.|$|E
500|$|Mary is {{the most}} {{prominent}} figure in the composition, taking up much {{of the center of}} the image. [...] She sits directly on the ground without a cushion between herself and the ground, to better communicate the theme of her relationship to the earth. The grass directly below the figure is green, which sharply contrasts to the grassless ground surrounding her, although the green is now darker and less visible than it was originally. [...] Joseph has a higher position in the image compared to Mary, perhaps {{as the head of the}} family, although this is an unusual feature in compositions of the Holy Family. [...] Mary is located between his legs, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> protecting her. [...] There is some debate as to whether Mary is receiving the Christ child from Joseph or vice versa. [...] Saint John the Baptist, the patron saint of Florence, is very commonly included in Florentine works depicting the Madonna and Child. He is in the middle-ground of the painting, between the Holy Family and the background. [...] The elements around the family include plants and perhaps water.|$|E
