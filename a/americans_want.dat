Artisanal toast, one might posit, represents our intensifying obsession with and fetishization of food. Every meal is special and important, every dish should be elevated, revered, and broadcast—even something as pedestrian as toast.” She argues that we are what we eat in terms of identity. “Avocado toast”—which {{might be described as}} a sub- or tangent-trend—has grown particular legs because it overlaps with another potent trend: “clean living.” [...] The fad has reportedly increased the price of avocados.|$|R
