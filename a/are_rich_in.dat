5|$|At higher altitudes {{the trees}} {{gradually}} thin out {{and there are}} alpine pastures. These pastures <b>are</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> flowers in the late spring. The wildflowers in the park's high meadows include wild pansies, gentians, martagon lilies, and alpenroses. The park has many rocky habitats. They are mostly located above the timberline and alpine pastures. These areas have rock and detritus on their surface. Alpine plants have adapted to these habitats by assuming characteristics like dwarfism, hairiness, bright coloured flowers, and highly developed roots. About 1,500 plant species {{can be seen at}} Paradisia Pyromaniacle Garden near Cogne inside the park.|$|E
5|$|Geologically {{the summit}} of the fell forms part of the Deepdale Formation, (principally volcaniclastic sandstone) {{underlain}} by the dacitic lapilli-tuff of the Helvellyn Formation. The geology of much of the Lake District is the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, of which Nethermost Pike is part, and is late Ordovician in age. The eastern cliffs of the range, including those of Nethermost Pike, <b>are</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> base minerals. When these rocks weather they form areas of fertile soil, which together with the area's inaccessibility and climate provide suitable conditions for plants of biological importance.|$|E
5|$|It {{shares the}} same nesting biology as S.speciosus. All cicada killers are ground-nesting insects and nest aggregations can contain up to {{hundreds}} of nests, each with a single provisioning female. Their tunnel is mainly made in well-drained, bare sandy soil, frequently under sidewalks, but is generally in full sunlight. Approximately 90% of its life is spent underground as a larva. It rarely infests grounds that <b>are</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> vegetation {{in order for them}} to get more sun. Mounds are easily recognizable by their distinctive U-shaped digging entrance.|$|E

5|$|Near its mouth, the {{surficial}} geology in {{the vicinity}} of Nanticoke Creek mainly consists of alluvium (which mainly consists of stratified silt, sand, and gravel, with some boulders), Wisconsinan Outwash (which contains stratified sand and gravel), and urban land (which is highly disrupted by cut and fill). Further upstream, the surficial geology mainly consists of coal dumps and surface mining land (both of which <b>are</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> rick waste), as well as a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. The upper reaches of the creek mainly are around surficial geology consisting of surface mining land, bedrock, and Wisconsinan Till.|$|E
5|$|RNAi {{has been}} used to genetically {{engineer}} plants to produce lower levels of natural plant toxins. Such techniques take advantage of the stable and heritable RNAi phenotype in plant stocks. Cotton seeds <b>are</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> dietary protein but naturally contain the toxic terpenoid product gossypol, making them unsuitable for human consumption. RNAi {{has been used}} to produce cotton stocks whose seeds contain reduced levels of delta-cadinene synthase, a key enzyme in gossypol production, without affecting the enzyme's production {{in other parts of the}} plant, where gossypol is itself important in preventing damage from plant pests. Similar efforts have been directed toward the reduction of the cyanogenic natural product linamarin in cassava plants.|$|E
5|$|Rocks from Incapillo <b>are</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> {{sodium and}} have high ratios of {{lanthanum}} and samarium to ytterbium and high ratios of barium to lanthanum, {{as well as}} high lead-206 to lead-204 and strontium-87/strontium-86 ratios. These rare-earth element patterns {{are similar to the}} Late Miocene Maricunga Belt rocks and contrast to early Miocene rocks. The changes occurred {{at the same time as}} the arc migrated eastward, terminating activity in the Maricunga Belt. The element ratios are pronouncedly arc-like with some adakitic signatures. The rocks contain considerably more sodium and alumina than almost all Central Andes siliceous volcanic rocks.|$|E

5|$|The {{connection}} with radon gas was first recognized among miners in the Ore Mountains near Schneeberg, Saxony. Silver has been mined there since 1470, and these mines <b>are</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> uranium, with its accompanying radium and radon gas. Miners developed a disproportionate amount of lung disease, eventually recognized as lung {{cancer in the}} 1870s. Despite this discovery, mining continued into the 1950s, due to the USSR's demand for uranium. Radon was confirmed {{as a cause of}} lung cancer in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The marbled {{electric}} ray is caught incidentally in bottom trawls, trammel nets, and bottom longlines; it has little economic value and is mostly discarded at sea when captured. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough population and fishery data to assess its conservation status beyond Data Deficient. At least in the northern Mediterranean, surveys have found that it remains the most common {{electric ray}}, and is perhaps becoming more abundant in Italian waters. This and other electric ray species are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs <b>are</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> acetylcholine receptors, which {{play an important role}} in the human nervous system.|$|E
5|$|The time in Arles {{became one}} of Van Gogh's more {{prolific}} periods: he completed 200 paintings, and more than 100 drawings and watercolours. He was enchanted by the local landscape and light; his works from this period <b>are</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> yellow, ultramarine and mauve. His paintings include harvests, wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area, including The Old Mill (1888), a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields. This was one of seven canvases sent to Pont-Aven on 4 October 1888 in an exchange of works with Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard, Charles Laval and others.|$|E

5|$|Bluebells are {{a species}} of {{deciduous}} woodland over much of their range, flowering and leafing early before the canopy closes in late spring. They may also be found growing under bracken or Japanese knotweed, perennial plants which also form stands with a dense summer canopy. They are most successful on slightly acid soils; the same niche in alkaline conditions may be occupied by other species such as Mercurialis perennis. As a species adapted to woodlands, the young shoots are able to penetrate through {{a thick layer of}} leaf litter, and bluebells are often used as an indicator species to identify ancient woodland. Bluebells are also frequently found in hedgerows, and in the west of their range they can be found growing in open habitats, including coastal meadows. Bluebell flowers <b>are</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> pollen and nectar, and are chiefly pollinated by bumblebees, although they are also visited by various other insects. They are a host species for the parasitic fungus Uromyces muscari, which causes bluebell rust. The ability of H.non-scripta to take up phosphorus from the soil is greatly enhanced by the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizae in its roots.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay {{takes place}} in the Fragmented Sectors, an area of outer space filled with asteroids that <b>are</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> mineral resources. The aim of the game is to {{colonise}} and mine the asteroids for the various ores found on them and then sell the ore to the Federation. The player can use the proceeds for empire expansion, purchasing new technologies, construction of buildings, ships and missiles, spying, trading and also to pay fines should the Federation impose any. Construction of the various missiles and ships requires quantities of different ores, so the decision to sell to the Federation is not straightforward. The game has a stock market where commodities can be bought and sold. There is also a black market offering unauthorised information regarding individual spies and colony supervisors, and illicit trade in rare ores and missiles. The manual states that any TetraCorp employee caught selling ore on the black market will be terminated.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{made with}} the NASA Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer have {{discovered}} that the disk around Beta Pictoris contains an extreme overabundance of carbon-rich gas. This helps stabilize the disk against radiation pressure which would otherwise blow the material away into interstellar space. Currently, there are two suggested explanations for {{the origin of the}} carbon overabundance. Beta Pictoris might be in the process of forming exotic carbon-rich planets, in contrast to the terrestrial planets in the Solar System, which <b>are</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> oxygen instead of carbon. Alternatively it may be passing through an unknown phase that might also have occurred early {{in the development of the}} Solar System: in the Solar System there are carbon-rich meteorites known as enstatite chondrites, which may have formed in a carbon-rich environment. It has also been proposed that Jupiter may have formed around a carbon-rich core.|$|E

60|$|I {{told you}} before, that good works must flow from faith: and now I tell you, {{that the best}} way to be {{fruitful}} in them, is to be much in the exercise of the doctrine of justification by grace; and they both agree; for as faith animates to good works, so the doctrine of grace animates faith. Wherefore, the way to <b>be</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> good works, it <b>is</b> to <b>be</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> faith; and the way to <b>be</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> faith <b>is</b> to be conscientiously affirming the doctrine of grace to others, and believing it ourselves.|$|R
5|$|Supernovae are {{the major}} source of {{elements}} heavier than nitrogen. These elements are produced by nuclear fusion for nuclei up to 34S, by silicon photodisintegration rearrangement and quasiequilibrium (see Supernova nucleosynthesis) during silicon burning for nuclei between 36Ar and 56Ni, and by rapid captures of neutrons during the supernova's collapse for elements heavier than iron. Nucleosynthesis during silicon burning yields nuclei roughly 1000-100,000 times more abundant than the r-process isotopes heavier than iron. Supernovae are the most likely, although not undisputed, candidate sites for the r-process, which is the rapid capture of neutrons that occurs at high temperature and high density of neutrons. Those reactions produce highly unstable nuclei that <b>are</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> neutrons and that rapidly beta decay into more stable forms. The r-process produces about half of all the heavier isotopes of the elements beyond iron, including plutonium and uranium. The only other major competing process for producing elements heavier than iron is the s-process in large, old, red-giant AGB stars, which produces these elements slowly over longer epochs and which cannot produce elements heavier than lead.|$|E
5|$|The Black Hills are in {{the southwestern}} part of South Dakota and extend into Wyoming. This range of low {{mountains}} covers 6,000sq. miles (15,500km2.) with mountains that rise from 2,000 to 4,000feet (600 to 1,200m) above their bases. The highest point in South Dakota, Black Elk Peak (formerly named Harney Peak) is 7,242ft or 2,207m above sea level {{and is in the}} Black Hills. This is the highest point in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. Other Black Hills mountains that are over 7,000ft (2,133m) in elevation include Bear Mountain, Crooks Tower, Terry Peak, and Crows Nest Peak. The Black Hills <b>are</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> minerals such as gold, silver, copper, and lead. The Homestake Mine, the largest and deepest gold mine in North America, was located in the Black Hills and produced over $1billion in gold since it started operation in 1876. The mine is now a scientific laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals <b>are</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the near surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E
