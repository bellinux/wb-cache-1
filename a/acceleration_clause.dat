50|$|The vast {{majority}} (but not all) of mortgages today have <b>acceleration</b> <b>clauses.</b> The holder of a mortgage without this clause {{has only two}} options: either to wait until all of the payments come due or convince a court to compel a sale of {{some parts of the}} property in lieu of the past due payments. Alternatively, the court may order the property sold subject to the mortgage, with the proceeds from the sale going to the payments owed the mortgage holder.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{not until}} Puerto Rico {{enlarged}} its outstanding debt to $71 billion—an amount approximately equal to 68% of Puerto Rico's gross domestic product (GDP)—that Puerto Rican bonds were downgraded to non-investment grade (better known as [...] "junk status" [...] or speculative grade) by three bond credit rating agencies between February 4 and 11, 2014. This downgrade triggered bond <b>acceleration</b> <b>clauses</b> that required Puerto Rico to repay certain debt instruments within months rather than years. Investors were concerned that Puerto Rico would eventually default on its debt. Such a default would reduce Puerto Rico's ability to issue bonds in the future. Puerto Rico currently states that it is unable to maintain its current operations unless it takes drastic measures {{that may lead to}} civil unrest. There have already been protests over the austerity measures. These events, along with a series of governmental financial deficits and a recession, have led to Puerto Rico's current debt crisis.|$|R
50|$|Originally the two releases, Quantum Gate and The Vortex, {{were written}} and {{designed}} as a single story/experience, but the publisher, Media Vision, exercised an <b>acceleration</b> <b>clause</b> in the development contract and demanded the title months ahead of the original release date - causing the developers to have to split the title into two. As a result, The Vortex was redesigned to allow its story to stand alone.|$|E
50|$|Suppose, for example, the {{contract}} was for A to purchase Blackacre from B for $100,000, to be paid in 5 monthly installments of $20,000. If A makes the first two payments, but fails to make the third payment, an <b>acceleration</b> <b>clause</b> would require that A must immediately pay B the entire balance of $60,000, or lose his right to purchase Blackacre (without getting a refund of his $40,000).|$|E
5000|$|Since land {{contracts}} {{can easily}} be written or modified by any seller or buyer; one may come across any variety of repayment plans. Interest only, negative amortizations, short balloons, extremely long amortizations {{just to name a}} few. It is not uncommon for land contracts to go unrecorded. For several reasons, the buyer or seller may decide that the contract is not to be recorded in the register of deeds. This does not make the contract invalid, but it does increase exposure to undesirable side effects. Some states, such as Minnesota, issue contracts without an <b>acceleration</b> <b>clause,</b> which {{in the case of a}} default leaves the seller in a position to either cancel the contract, discharging any principal deficiency, as in the case of deprecation, or to litigate for 18 months or more while letting the buyer, if not a corporation, retain their rights to the property while collection attempts are made, by which time the buyer will often qualify for bankruptcy, making the contract, when lacking said <b>acceleration</b> <b>clause,</b> effectively an installment option, when the buyer has no other lienable assets. In bankruptcy, some regions will interpret it as an executory contract that can be rejected, while others will treat it as a debt to be paid out of the bankruptcy trust. This and a wide variety of other legal ambiguities has led to a trend toward eliminating the use of Land Contracts to remove any incentives, and as a result, the disadvantages that these contracts have compared to the standard note and mortgage, which are more clearly defined in, and regulated by, law.|$|E
40|$|Today, {{virtually}} all mortgages contain <b>acceleration</b> <b>clauses</b> permitting the mortgagee {{to accelerate the}} mortgage indebtedness upon default by the mortgagor as defined in the mortgage loan documentation. Section 8. 1 of the new Restatement (Third) of Property: Mortgages [hereinafter Mortgages Restatement] 1 endorses the view that these mortgage acceleration provisions are generally enforceable after default {{in accordance with their}} terms. Following default and acceleration, the mortgagor may prevent foreclosure only by redeeming the property from the mortgage debt, i. e., “only by paying or tendering to the mortgagee the full accelerated mortgage obligation. ” Section 8. 1 (d) (3), however, places certain constraints upon the mortgagee 2 ̆ 7 s right to accelerate, permitting the mortgagor to reinstate (after curing any existing defaults) if “the mortgagee has engaged in fraud, bad faith, or other conduct making acceleration unconscionable. ” This standard has a significant judicial pedigree in mortgage law decisions, but its use of the elusive term “bad faith” [...] a term often understood in the context of its more honorable twin, “good faith” [...] creates the potential for uncertainty in the evaluation of disputes over the enforcement of acceleration provisions...|$|R
40|$|For two decades, {{collective}} action clauses (CACs) {{have been part}} of the official-sector response to sovereign debt crisis, justified by claims that these clauses can help prevent bailouts and shift the burden of restructuring onto the private sector. Reform efforts in the 1990 s and 2000 s focused on CACs. So do efforts in the Eurozone today. CACs have even been suggested as the cure for the US municipal bond market. But bonds without CACs are still issued in major markets, so reformers feel obliged to explain why they know better. Over time, a narrative has emerged to justify pro-CAC reforms. It relies on history and portrays CACs as novel solutions to previously-unappreciated coordination problems among bondholders. But this pro-CAC narrative is based on flawed premises. In this article, we trace the use of CACs in sovereign bonds during the 20 th century. We show that CACs have been used for much of that time, although often in forms (such as trustee and collective <b>acceleration</b> <b>clauses)</b> that are no longer central to modern reform debates (which focus on modification clauses). Market participants have long been aware of CACs but did not view them as a necessary part of sovereign bond documentation. Indeed, we recount one episode in which sovereign debt was restructured without anyone seeming to notice that the relevant debt already included CACs. Contracts do not always include the optimal terms, and, at the margins, the sovereign debt markets might perform better if all bonds contained CACs. But if CACs are to be a central part of reform agendas, they should be defended on functional grounds rather than on contestable historical ones...|$|R
50|$|Acceleration is {{a clause}} {{that is usually}} found in Sections 16, 17, or 18 of a mortgage. Not all {{accelerations}} are the same for each mortgage, as {{it depends on the}} terms and conditions between lender and obligated mortgagor(s). When a term in the mortgage has been broken, the <b>acceleration</b> <b>clause</b> goes into effect. It can declare the entire payable debt to the Lender if the Borrower(s) were to transfer the title at a future date to a purchaser. The clause in the mortgage also instructs that a notice of acceleration must be served to the obligated mortgagor(s) who signed the Note. Each mortgage gives a time period for the debtor(s) to cure their loan. The most common time periods allot to debtor(s) is usually 30 days, but for commercial property it can be 10 days. The notice of acceleration is called a Demand and/or Breach Letter. In the letter it informs the Borrower(s) that they have 10 or 30 days from the date on the letter to reinstate their loan. Demand/Breach letters are sent out by Certified and Regular mail to all notable addresses of the Borrower(s). Also in the acceleration of the mortgage the lender must provide a payoff quote that is estimated 30 days from the date of the letter. This letter is called an FDCPA (Fair Debt Collections Practices Acts) letter and/or Initial Communication Letter. Once the Borrower(s) receives the two letters providing a time period to reinstate or payoff their loan the lender must wait until that time expires in to take further action. When the 10 or 30 days have passed that means that the acceleration has expired and the Lender can move forward with foreclosing on the property.|$|E
40|$|Borrowings {{outstanding}} {{under certain}} revolving credit agreements are considered longterm debt because the borrowings are due {{at the end}} of a specified period (for example, 3 years) rather than when short-term notes roll over (for example, every 90 days). Borrowings may be collateralized, but the only note is the overall note signed at the agreement's inception. Some agreements require that the borrower maintain a lock box with the lender, whereby the borrower’s customers are required to remit payments directly to the lender and amounts received are applied to reduce the debt outstanding. If borrowings outstanding under the agreement are considered long-term obligations, the effect of a subjective <b>acceleration</b> <b>clause</b> on balance sheet classification is determined based on the criteria in Technical Bulletin 79 - 3. If borrowings outstanding are considered short-term obligations, and the borrower intends to refinance the obligation on a long-term basis, Statement 6 applies and the debt would be classified as a current liability because of the existence of the subjective <b>acceleration</b> <b>clause.</b> Copyright © 1998, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistributio...|$|E
40|$|Loan {{agreements}} may {{specify the}} debtor's repayment terms but also enable the creditor, at his discretion, to demand payment at any time. Those loan arrangements may have wording such as "the term note shall mature in monthly installments {{as set forth}} therein or on demand, whichever is earlier, " or "principal and interest shall be due on demand, or if no demand is made, in quarterly installments beginning on [...] " The issue is how debt with such terms should be (1) reported in a classified balance sheet and (2) disclosed in the maturities of long-term obligations. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that such an obligation {{should be considered a}} current liability in accordance with Statement 78. Additionally, the Task Force noted that the demand provision is not a subjective <b>acceleration</b> <b>clause</b> as discussed in Technical Bulletin 79 - 3. STATUS No further EITF discussion is planned...|$|E
