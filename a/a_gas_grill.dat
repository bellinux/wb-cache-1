50|$|<b>A</b> <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> burner is {{the central}} source of heat for cooking food. Gas grill burners are {{typically}} constructed of: stainless steel, aluminized steel, or cast iron, occasionally porcelain-coated.|$|E
50|$|The {{use of a}} time {{pressure}} gauge provides for better planning with any instrument that emits carbon gas through varying consumption rates determined by pressurized contents. Efficiency is maximized by understanding energy requirements in time. One such example would be {{something as simple as}} <b>a</b> <b>gas</b> <b>grill.</b> Operation of <b>a</b> <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> with all burners on can observe tangible results (time reduction) by turning the gas control to low or by shutting off one burner. Seeing the increase in time will automatically indicate an increase in energy saving. Most notably the {{time pressure}} gauge could reduce carbon emissions in all air travel through increased fuel efficiency, while also reducing fuel cost. Furthermore, recently the airline industry is under pressure to reduce carbon emissions globally, and instruments such as the time pressure gauge could spearhead this movement.|$|E
5000|$|Yakimochi is grilled or broiled mochi or pounded rice cake. Traditionally, it is {{prepared}} {{using a small}} charcoal grill, but in modern times <b>a</b> <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> can be used. During {{the time of the}} Autumn Moon, it is traditional to eat fresh yakimochi while sipping sake and enjoying the view of the full moon.|$|E
50|$|A hybrid grill is a grill {{used for}} outdoor cooking with {{charcoal}} {{and natural gas}} or liquid propane and can cook {{in the same manner}} as <b>a</b> traditional outdoor <b>gas</b> <b>grill.</b> The manufacturers claim that it combines the convenience of <b>an</b> outdoor <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> with the flavor and cooking techniques of a charcoal and wood grill.|$|R

5000|$|A {{small metal}} [...] "smoker box" [...] {{containing}} wood chips {{may be used}} on <b>a</b> <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> to give a smoky flavor to the grilled foods. Although, barbecue purists would argue that to get a true smoky flavor (and smoke ring) the user has to cook low and slow, indirectly and using wood or charcoal. Gas grills are difficult to maintain at the low temperatures required (~225-250 °F), especially for extended periods.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the use of}} {{a school}} bus body for the Transit Home/Wanderlodge {{provided}} for fairly conservative design, Blue Bird marketed the vehicle based on its high specifications and high degree of customization, built entirely to order. By the end of the 1980s, a Wanderlodge was available with nearly 200 standard options. Along with the common bedroom and bathroom (fitted with a bathtub), the Wanderlodge could be fitted with full kitchen, <b>a</b> <b>gas</b> <b>grill,</b> a doorbell, and a central vacuum system; a popular option among owners was a programmable horn with 60 different sounds. [...] While also purchased by celebrity owners and heads of state, Blue Bird found that the typical Wanderlodge buyer was a couple with the funds to afford the purchase and a high desire to travel the country by road.|$|E
50|$|This {{method of}} cooking, known as {{indirect}} (or convection) cooking {{is also used}} by traditional charcoal and wood smokers. That similarity, {{and the fact that}} wood pellets produce smoke that flavors food, resulted in many early adopters turning to pellet grills as an easy-to-use alternative to traditional smokers. Joe Traeger worked to combine the best elements of gas and charcoal grills. The Traeger Grill revolutionized smoking by bringing the ability to slow-cook authentic BBQ to the masses with simplicity and convenience. Like <b>a</b> <b>gas</b> <b>grill,</b> Traeger Grills has a continuous fuel source—once the hopper is loaded with pellets, the auger repeatedly and automatically feeds them into the fire pot at predetermined intervals. The ability to cook at a relatively consistent temperature for hours without tending physical coal or wood fires appealed to BBQers who had become accustomed to tending smokers during long day or overnight cooks.|$|E
50|$|A flame broiler is <b>a</b> {{commercial}} mechanical <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> used to cook various products. It is in {{use by the}} Burger King {{fast-food restaurant}} chain and was also used by the Burger Chef chain.|$|R
50|$|In {{an attempt}} to combine the best {{attributes}} of a real wood fire, a convection oven, <b>a</b> high-end <b>gas</b> <b>grill,</b> and <b>a</b> smoker, Memphis created a grill that uses 100 percent natural wood pellets. The grills have an intelligent temperature control panel {{that is used to}} set exact temperatures based on cooking needs. Between the different models, the grills have a recorded range of 180-700 °F, the highest of which can be achieved through an open-flame insert.|$|R
50|$|The {{charcoal}} cart grill {{is quite}} similar in appearance to <b>a</b> typical <b>gas</b> <b>grill.</b> The cart grill can be rectangular or kettle in design, has a hinged lid, cooking grid, charcoal grid, and is mounted to a cart with wheels and side tables. Most cart grills {{have a way}} to adjust heat, either through moving the cooking surface up, the charcoal pan down, through venting, or a combination of the three. Cart grills often have an ash collection drawer for easy removal of ashes while cooking. Their rectangular design makes them usable for indirect cooking as well. Charcoal cart grills, with all their features, can make charcoal grilling nearly as convenient as <b>gas</b> <b>grilling.</b> Cart grills can also be quite expensive.|$|R
50|$|After Shumaker's {{departure}} from the University of Tennessee, {{all three of the}} universities where he had been president undertook audits of his spending during his presidencies. The University of Tennessee found that Shumaker had incurred $165,000 in expenses for football-related entertainment and $73,000 in expenses for holiday receptions. He also ordered $493,000 in renovations and new furnishings for his official residence, which had been remodeled at a cost of $787,597 less than a year earlier. His unauthorized purchases for the home included $97,350 for a new sun room and closet, $77,270 to create two bedrooms for his sons, a new telecommunications system that cost $64,000, a $7,000 Persian rug, two $7,400 entertainment systems, and <b>a</b> $4,822 <b>gas</b> <b>grill.</b> Officials in Connecticut deemed the Hyundai payments to be a violation of the state's ethics laws, but could not prosecute because of the statute of limitations.|$|R
2500|$|Hamburgers {{are usually}} {{a feature of}} fast food restaurants. The hamburgers served in major fast food establishments are usually mass-produced in {{factories}} and frozen for delivery to the site. These hamburgers are thin and of uniform thickness, differing from the traditional American hamburger prepared in homes and conventional restaurants, which is thicker and prepared by hand from ground beef. Most American hamburgers are round, but some fast-food chains, such as Wendy's, sell square-cut hamburgers. Hamburgers in fast food restaurants are usually grilled on a flat-top, but some firms, such as Burger King, use <b>a</b> <b>gas</b> flame <b>grilling</b> process. At conventional American restaurants, hamburgers may be ordered [...] "rare", but normally are served medium-well or well-done for food safety reasons. Fast food restaurants do not usually offer this option.|$|R
5|$|McLamore and Edgerton {{acquired}} {{a license to}} operate an Insta-Burger King franchise and opened their first location on 4 December 1954 at 3090 NW 36th Street in Miami. By 1959, the pair had stores at several locations within the Miami-Dade area, and operations were growing at a fast rate. However, the partners discovered that the insta-broiler units' heating elements were prone to degradation from the drippings of the beef patties. The pair eventually created <b>a</b> mechanized <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> that avoided the problems by cooking the meat patties a different way inside the unit. The new cooking appliance, which they called a flame broiler, moved the patties over the flame vertically on a chain link conveyor over the heating elements, a design that imparted grill lines on the patties similar to those made on a charcoal grill. The new unit worked so well that they {{made the decision to}} replace all of their Insta-Broilers with the newly designed unit.|$|R
5|$|The company {{known today}} as Burger King itself began as a franchise; the {{predecessor}} of the modern company was founded in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, as Insta-Burger King. The original founders and owners, Kieth J. Kramer and Matthew Burns, opened their first stores around {{a piece of equipment}} known as the Insta-Broiler. The Insta-Broiler oven proved so successful at cooking burgers, Kramer and Burns required all of their franchises to carry the device. The rights to open stores in Miami, Florida, belonged to two businessmen named James McLamore and David R. Edgerton and their company: South Florida Restaurants, Inc. Due to operational issues with the Insta-Broiler, in 1954 McLamore and Edgarton made the decision to replace the Insta-Broiler with <b>a</b> mechanized <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> they called <b>a</b> flame broiler. Even though the company had rapidly expanded throughout the state until its operations totaled more than 40 locations in 1955, the original Insta-Burger King ran into financial difficulties and the pair of McLamore and Edgarton purchased the national rights to the chain and rechristened the company as Burger King of Miami.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> {{components}} can {{be replaced}} with new parts, adding to the useful life of the grill. Though charcoal grills can sometimes require new cooking grids and charcoal grates, <b>gas</b> <b>grills</b> are much more complex, and require additional components such as burners, valves, and heat shields.|$|R
50|$|At {{roughly the}} same time as Kroc was conceiving what {{eventually}} became McDonald's Corporation, two Miami, Florida businessmen, James McLamore and David Edgerton, opened a franchise of the predecessor to what is now the international fast food restaurant chain Burger King. McLamore had visited the original McDonald's hamburger stand belonging to the McDonald brothers; sensing potential in their innovative assembly line-based production system, he decided he wanted to open a similar operation of his own. The two partners eventually decided to invest their money in Jacksonville, Florida-based Insta-Burger King. Originally opened in 1953, the founders and owners of the chain, Kieth J. Kramer and his wife's uncle Matthew Burns, opened their first stores around a piece of equipment known as the Insta-Broiler. The Insta-Broiler oven proved so successful at cooking burgers, they required all of their franchises to carry the device. By 1959 McLamore and Edgarton were operating several locations within the Miami-Dade area and were growing at a fast clip. Despite the success of their operation, the partners discovered that the design of the insta-broiler made the unit's heating elements prone to degradation from the drippings of the beef patties. The pair eventually created <b>a</b> mechanized <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> that avoided the problems by changing the way the meat patties were cooked in the unit. After the original company began to falter in 1959, it was purchased by McLamore and Edgerton who renamed the company Burger King.|$|R

5000|$|... "Pellet grills", {{sometimes}} referred to as pellet smokers, are backyard cookers that combine elements of charcoal smokers, <b>gas</b> <b>grills,</b> and kitchen ovens. Fueled by wood pellets, pellet grills infuse food with smoky flavor associated with charcoal grills and smokers, but offer the convenience of <b>gas</b> <b>grills</b> and the temperature control of an indoor oven. They have the ability to smoke as well as grill and bake using an electronic control panel to automatically feed fuel to the fire, regulate the grill’s airflow, and maintain consistent cooking temperatures. The best pellet grills also utilize sophisticated sensors and advanced algorithms for precision temperature control.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>gas</b> <b>grills</b> follow the cart grill design concept: the grill unit itself {{is attached to}} a wheeled frame that holds the fuel tank. The wheeled frame may also support side tables and other features.|$|R
50|$|Piezoelectric {{transducers}} and actuators {{are often}} {{made of the}} complex oxide PZT (lead zirconate titanate).

5000|$|It is {{possible}} to braise meats and vegetables in a pot on top of <b>a</b> <b>grill.</b> <b>A</b> <b>gas</b> or electric <b>grill</b> {{would be the best}} choices for what is known as [...] "barbecue-braising" [...] or [...] "grill-braising", or combining grilling directly on the surface and braising in a pot. To braise on a grill, put a pot on top of the grill, cover it, and let it simmer for a few hours. There are two advantages to barbecue-braising. The first is that this method allows for browning the meat directly on the grill before the braising, and the second is that it also allows for glazing the meat with sauce and finishing it directly over the fire after the braising, effectively cooking the meat three times, which results in a soft textured product that falls right off the bone. This method of cooking is slower than regular grilling but faster than pit-smoking, starting out fast, slowing down, and then speeding up again to finish. If a pressure cooker is used, the cooking time will be much faster.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{increased}} demand for home grills, Char-Broil began to mass-produce <b>gas</b> <b>grills</b> in the 1960s. In 1961, Char-Broil patented the first grease-handling system for an outdoor grill to make grilling safer and easier. In the 1970s, {{they were the first}} to package the LP tank and grill in one box, which revolutionized the backyard grill industry. Char-Broil introduced the first electric <b>grills,</b> portable <b>gas</b> <b>grills</b> and table-top grills in the 1970s. In 1973, the Manufacturing Division moved from the Iron Works to a more modern plant in the Bradley Industrial Park and becomes known as W.C. Bradley Enterprises. Then in 1977, W.C. Bradley Enterprises became known as Char-Broil. In 1989, Char-Broil became a separate business division of the W.C. Bradley Company.|$|R
50|$|Cooktops and ovens are <b>a</b> mix of <b>gas</b> and electric, while gas {{clothes dryers}} are rather rare.

Some homes also have natural <b>gas</b> barbecue <b>grills,</b> formerly sold at utility company stores.|$|R
5000|$|Another type of <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> gaining {{popularity}} {{is called a}} flattop grill. According to Hearth and Home magazine, flattop grills [...] "on which food cooks on a griddlelike surface and is not exposed to an open flame at all" [...] is an emerging trend in the outdoor grilling market.|$|R
5000|$|The outdoor <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> {{was invented}} in the early 1950s by Don McGlaughlin, owner of the Chicago Combustion Corporation, known today as LazyMan. McGlaughlin invented the first {{built-in}} grill from the successful gas broiler called BROILBURGER. These first Lazy-Man grills were marketed as [...] "open-fire charcoal-type gas broilers" [...] which featured [...] "permanent coals", otherwise known as lava rock. In the 1950s, most residential households {{did not have a}} barbecue, so the term broiler was used for marketing purposes to commercial establishments. The gas open-broiler design was adapted into the first portable <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> in 1954 by Chicago Combustion Corporation as the Model AP. McGlaughlin's portable design was the first to feature the use of the 20-lb propane cylinders, which previously were exclusively used by plumbers as a fuel source.|$|R
