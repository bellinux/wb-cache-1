A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E
25|$|Mandy and Adam {{were later}} shown the entire suicide note. Mandy reports that Adam {{immediately}} voiced {{that he did}} not see anything on the letter than indicated it was written by Daniel, and the note appeared to be 'cold' and 'matter-of-fact'. The note also stated 'don't blame the guy I was with last night'. When Mandy and Adam asked the Police if they had looked into who the note was referring to, the Police said they didn't know, may never know, and that they weren't ever going to find out <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers.</b> Mandy reported that in hindsight, she doesn't feel Dagenham Police were investigating properly, and they wouldn't have had to look very far to find out Port was behind it, and save another family from emotional turmoil. When Mandy wished to challenge the open verdict or continue investigation, she reported that she was told that nothing more could be done, and she felt there was an attitude of 'it is what it is, deal with it'.|$|E

500|$|Shave Magazine Jake Tomlinson {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars and wrote, [...] "There is a very strong sense of humor as well as {{emotional}} depth, yet the scope of the film sometimes limits these sentiments.

500|$|He read Jessica Mitford's book The American Way of Death Revisited, which {{discusses}} the funeral industry, {{and was able}} to take a tour with funeral salesmen at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. At the time, he did not reveal that this was for research, and instead pretended to have a dying relative. According to Maxtone-Graham, the tour helped him find out [...] "all about urns versus coffins, and cremation. I asked sort of questions about, 'Well, do the bodies smell?' They were very nice and gave me <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers.</b> It was quite fascinating." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{construct}} (such as a Codd table) {{is said to}} be {{a strong}} representation system (of missing information) if any answer to a query made on the construct can be particularized to obtain an answer for any corresponding query on the relations it represents, which are seen as models of the construct.

500|$|The {{implementation}} {{of all of}} the advised actions, the report stated, would [...] "result in the recovery of healthy, sustainable ecosystems throughout south Florida". The report admitted that it did not have <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers,</b> though no plan could. However, it predicted that it would restore the [...] "essential defining features of the pre-drainage wetlands over large portions of the remaining system", that populations of all animals would increase, and animal distribution patterns would return to their natural states. Critics expressed concern over some unused technology; scientists were unsure if the quarries would hold as much water as was being suggested, and whether the water would harbor harmful bacteria from the quarries. Overtaxing the aquifers was another concern—it was not a technique that had been previously attempted.|$|E

500|$|Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song is {{considered}} to be an important film in the history of African American cinema. Hollywood studios were led to attempt to replicate the film's success by producing black-oriented films such as Shaft and Super Fly. Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song was credited by Variety as leading {{to the creation of the}} blaxploitation genre, largely consisting of exploitation films made by white directors. As Spike Lee states, [...] "Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song gave us <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> we needed. This was an example of how to make a film (a real movie), distribute it yourself, and most important, get paid.

500|$|For the episode, Gillian Anderson's {{character}} Dana Scully {{was written}} off {{as a member of}} The X-Files office, since the next season would mark the creation of the [...] "new" [...] X-Files with Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish taking over for Duchovny and Anderson. Because of this change, Spotnitz called [...] "Alone" [...] the last of the [...] "old" [...] X-Files stand-alone episodes. As with many other episodes, Duchovny did not want his character to have <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers,</b> giving the reason that it looked too easy for him. Duchovny and Spotnitz later had a long discussion on how to remove the scenes or tweak them. Unfortunately, because the episode was the last stand-alone episode to feature the character of Fox Mulder, Duchovny did not care as much as [...] "usual" [...] about creating a [...] "mystery" [...] for the episode.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] an A-, and wrote, [...] "Irreverent camp that's infested with laughs (and creepy-crawlies) but throws credibility out the window." [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A and {{compared it to}} the previously Morgan-penned [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", writing, [...] "So! This is the second Darin Morgan episode I've had to write about, and once again, I'm not sure I've done it justice. [...] The comedy here can be broad, but there's always enough self-aware commentary buried in it that it never becomes simplistic. While [...] "Bruckman" [...] dealt with the misery of knowing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers,</b> [...] "Coprophages" [...] looks at {{how easy it is}} to convince yourself you know what's going on, even when you don't. It'd be better to believe in a bunch of bugs from outer space coming down to earth to mess with our minds, than it would be to accept the more likely truth that bugs like shit—and around here, there's always plenty to go around." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode an 8/10 and praised the episode's self-parodying style, saying, [...] "Overall, this episode was a rare self-contained parody, well written by Darin Morgan. By standing on its own outside of continuity, the episode gives itself plenty of room to send-up the series premise and its early internet fandom. There’s no real sense of resolution, but that’s really incidental to the point of the parody." [...] Author Phil Farrand rated the episode as his second favorite episode of the first four seasons in his book The Nitpickers Guide to the X-Files.|$|E

500|$|... "For June Bolan, {{the alarm}} bells began to sound only when Syd kept his girlfriend under {{lock and key}} for three days, {{occasionally}} shoving a ration of biscuits under the door." [...] A claim of cruelty against Barrett committed by the groupies and hangers-on who frequented his apartment during this period was described by writer and critic Jonathan Meades. [...] "I went [...] to see Harry and there was this terrible noise. It sounded like heating pipes shaking. I said, 'What's up?' and he sort of giggled and said, 'That's Syd having a bad trip. We put him in the linen cupboard'". Storm Thorgerson responded to this claim by stating [...] "I do not remember locking Syd up in a cupboard. It sounds to me like pure fantasy, like Jonathan Meades was on dope himself." [...] Other friends assert that Barrett's infamous flatmates, [...] "Mad Jock" [...] and [...] "Mad Sue," [...] believed that acid held <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> and thought of Barrett as a genius or [...] "god," [...] and were spiking his morning coffee with LSD every day without his knowledge, leaving him in a never-ending trip. He was later rescued from that flat by friends and moved elsewhere, but his erratic behavior continued. Watkinson and Anderson included quotes from a story told to them by Thorgerson that underscored how volatile Barrett could be. [...] "On one occasion, I had to pull him off Lindsay (Barrett's girlfriend at the time) because he was beating her over the head with a mandolin". On one occasion, Barrett threw a woman called Gilly across the room, because she refused to go to Gilmour's house. These strange behaviors contradicted Barrett's usually gentle nature. According to Gilmour in an interview with Nick Kent, the other members of Pink Floyd approached psychiatrist R. D. Laing with the 'Barrett problem'. After hearing a tape of a Barrett conversation, Laing declared him [...] "incurable".|$|E

In other cases, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> in the category round shared an announced characteristic in common (e.g., geographical locations whose names begin and end with [...] "A").
