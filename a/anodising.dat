25|$|Aluminium oxide is {{responsible}} for the resistance of metallic aluminium to weathering. Metallic aluminium is very reactive with atmospheric oxygen, and a thin passivation layer of aluminium oxide (4nm thickness) forms on any exposed aluminium surface. This layer protects the metal from further oxidation. The thickness and properties of this oxide layer can be enhanced using a process called <b>anodising.</b> A number of alloys, such as aluminium bronzes, exploit this property by including a proportion of aluminium in the alloy to enhance corrosion resistance. The aluminium oxide generated by <b>anodising</b> is typically amorphous, but discharge assisted oxidation processes such as plasma electrolytic oxidation result in a significant proportion of crystalline aluminium oxide in the coating, enhancing its hardness.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the beta phase in Mg-Al alloys on the {{corrosion}} performance of an <b>anodised</b> coating was studied. It {{was found that the}} corrosion resistance of the <b>anodised</b> coating was closely associated with the corrosion performance of the substrate alloy.

The poor performance of an <b>anodised</b> coating was attributed partly to lower corrosion resistance of the substrate alloy and partly to the higher porosity of the <b>anodised</b> coating.

40|$|This work {{studied the}} effect of the {{impurity}} iron and the alloying elements aluminium and zinc in single-phase substrate magnesium alloys on the corrosion resistance of the alloys after anodisation. It was found that increasing zinc content (0 - 2 %) led to increased corrosion resistance of an <b>anodised</b> single-phase Mg-Zn alloy. The addition of Al lowered the corrosion resistance of an <b>anodised</b> commercial purity Mg-Al single-phase alloy, whereas the same addition was found to be beneficial to the corrosion resistance of an <b>anodised</b> high purity Mg-Al single-phase alloy. Heat-treatment made the substrate Mg-Al and Mg-Zn alloys more uniform and hence improved the corrosion resistance of the alloys after anodisation. The detrimental effect of iron impurity on corrosion performance of the unanodised substrate single-phase magnesium alloys was inherited by the <b>anodised</b> alloys. The corrosion resistance of the <b>anodised</b> Mg alloys was found to be closely correlated with the corrosion performance of the unanodised as-cast Mg alloys. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

30|$|Although {{chloride}} ions {{are known}} to have detrimental effect on zirconium, polarization curves show an increase in the passive zone for the <b>anodised</b> condition {{in the absence of a}} rupture potential, together with a decrease in passive current density when compared to the control. This is indicative of a higher corrosion resistance of the <b>anodised</b> condition, which improves the barrier effect respect to the control. Accordingly, in EIS spectra the increase of total impedance modulus together with a rise in the phase angle plot in the low frequency region, and a shift to higher frequencies that can be related to the increase of the barrier effect for the <b>anodised</b> condition. This fact has already been observed in previous studies conducted on plane zirconium samples where the stability of the oxide is formed and the thickness increase for the <b>anodised</b> samples were demonstrated (Hoerth et al. 2014).|$|R

50|$|Two {{independent}} pathways {{for corrosion}} of elements are hydrolysis and oxidation by oxygen. The combination {{of water and}} oxygen is even more corrosive. Virtually all elements burn {{in an atmosphere of}} oxygen, or an oxygen rich environment. In the presence of water and oxygen (or simply air), some elements— sodium—react rapidly, even dangerously, to give the hydroxides. In part for this reason, alkali and alkaline earth metals are not found in nature in their metallic, i.e., native, form. Caesium is so reactive with oxygen that it is used as a getter in vacuum tubes, and solutions of potassium and sodium, so-called NaK are used to deoxygenate and dehydrate some organic solvents. The surface of most metals consists of oxides and hydroxides in the presence of air. A well-known example is aluminium foil, which is coated with a thin film of aluminium oxide that passivates the metal, slowing further corrosion. The aluminium oxide layer can be built to greater thickness by the process of electrolytic <b>anodising.</b> Though solid magnesium and aluminium react slowly with oxygen at STP—they, like most metals, burn in air, generating very high temperatures. Finely grained powders of most metals can be dangerously explosive in air. Consequently, they are often used in Solid-fuel rockets.|$|E
