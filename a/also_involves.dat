5|$|AMiBA is {{the result}} of a {{collaboration}} between the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, the National Taiwan University and the Australia Telescope National Facility. It <b>also</b> <b>involves</b> researchers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, the University of Hawaii, the University of Bristol, Nottingham Trent University, the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics and the Carnegie-Mellon University.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{control is}} a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects, mites, weeds and plant diseases using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory, or other natural mechanisms, but typically <b>also</b> <b>involves</b> an active human management role. It {{can be an important}} component of integrated pest management (IPM) programs.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to initial}} reports of monogamy, ruffed lemurs {{in the wild}} exhibit {{seasonal}} polygamous breeding behavior, with {{both males and females}} mating with more than one partner within a single season. Mating is not restricted to just community members, but <b>also</b> <b>involves</b> members of neighboring communities. Females mate primarily with males with whom they had affiliative relations prior to mating season, although some matings occurred with roaming males from other communities.|$|E

5|$|Hambleton District Council {{have plans}} to build lots of new housing {{as part of a}} north Northallerton {{development}} scheme. This <b>also</b> <b>involves</b> creating a link road between the A167 and the A684 meaning a bridge over the Middlesbrough railway will need to be built. Yuill Homes and Taylor Wimpey UK Ltd have already submitted a planning application for the construction of 283 dwellings on the former York Trailers site (on Yafforth Road).|$|E
5|$|In {{the short}} story The Harbor-Master, by Robert W. Chambers, the {{discovery}} and attempted recovery of the last known pair of great auks {{is central to the}} plot (which <b>also</b> <b>involves</b> a proto-H.P. Lovecraftian element of suspense). The story first appeared in Ainslee's Magazine (Aug 1889) and was slightly revised to become the first five chapters of Chambers' episodic novel In Search of the Unknown, (Harper and Brothers Publishers, New York, 1904).|$|E
5|$|The RNA is {{typically}} cleaved before transcription termination, as CstF also binds to RNA polymerase II. Through a poorly understood mechanism (as of 2002), it signals for RNA polymerase II to slip {{off of the}} transcript. Cleavage <b>also</b> <b>involves</b> the protein CFII, though it is unknown how. The cleavage site associated with a polyadenylation signal can vary up to some 50 nucleotides.|$|E

5|$|AMiBA was {{originally}} configured as a 7-element interferometer atop a hexapod mount. Observations at a wavelength of 3mm (86–102GHz) started in October 2006, and the detections of six clusters by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect were announced in 2008. In 2009 the telescope was upgraded to 13 elements, {{and it is}} capable of further expansion to 19 elements. AMiBA {{is the result of a}} collaboration between the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, the National Taiwan University and the Australia Telescope National Facility, and <b>also</b> <b>involves</b> researchers from other universities.|$|E
5|$|After {{success with}} {{shooting}} down alien scout ships and securing the crash sites from surviving alien crews, {{as well as}} interdicting alien attempts to abduct human civilians for unknown purposes, XCOM manages to also obtain the corpses of various different alien troops. Autopsies reveal that all these types have been genetically and/or cybernetically altered, which seems to indicate they are merely foot-soldiers for unseen leaders. XCOM's head of research, Dr. Vahlen, requests that a live alien be captured for interrogation. This <b>also</b> <b>involves</b> developing a specialized weapon capable of capturing a live alien, and constructing a facility in XCOM's subterranean base capable of safely holding a live alien prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{pest control}} is a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but typically <b>also</b> <b>involves</b> an active human management role. Classical biological control involves the introduction of natural enemies of the pest that are bred in the laboratory and released into the environment. An alternative approach is to augment the natural enemies that occur {{in a particular area}} by releasing more, either in small, repeated batches, or in a single large-scale release. Ideally, the released organism will breed and survive, and provide long-term control. Biological control can be an important component of an integrated pest management programme.|$|E

5|$|Despite Tahara's {{large-scale}} automation, Lexus LS production <b>also</b> <b>involves</b> specialized {{personnel who}} are tasked with key production points, such as testing each vehicle's V8 engine via dynamometer and stethoscope for calibration before installation. With the LS 460, a hand-sanded paint process was introduced. The production standards {{used on the}} Lexus LS were eventually adopted by the manufacturer for other vehicles; in 2007, the assembly of Toyota Corolla economy cars used the same panel gap measurements as the LS 400 did eighteen years earlier.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{greatest}} differences between the solitary and gregarious phases is behavioural. The gregaria nymphs are attracted to each other, this being seen {{as early as the}} second instar. They soon form bands of many thousands of individuals. These groups behave like cohesive units and move across the landscape, mostly downhill, but making their way round barriers and merging with other bands. The attraction between the insects seems to be largely visual, but <b>also</b> <b>involves</b> olfactory cues, and the band seem to navigate using the sun. They pause to feed at intervals before resuming their march, and may cover tens of kilometres over a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Soviet Union {{leaves a}} power vacuum in Eastern Europe that former KGB Chairman Uri Vatsiznov, AKA the Shadowman, is willing to exploit for his own ends. In the first mission, which {{takes place in the}} Crimea, the player must rescue a {{captured}} spy named Nick Arnold to retrieve intelligence on the game's antagonist. The second level is set in the Sea of Azov: the player must battle the elements of the Black Sea Fleet which is preparing to invade Europe. The mission <b>also</b> <b>involves</b> the rescue of guerrilla fighter Amad.|$|E

5|$|Widening of the Kwinana Freeway with {{an extra}} {{southbound}} lane between Roe Highway and Armadale Road began in mid-2014. The project aims to increase the freeway's reliability, efficiency, and safety, as the current two-lane configuration is subject to {{a large proportion of}} heavy vehicles and severe peak hour congestion. The project <b>also</b> <b>involves</b> the realignment of ramps at Berrigan Drive and Armadale Road, construction of noise barriers and noise walls where required, and installation of components for intelligent transport systems – optic fibre communications, vehicle detection devices, and closed circuit cameras.|$|E
5|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{biodiesel}} is lower carbon emissions, although the energy balance of liquid biofuels {{is a matter}} of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised {{on the grounds that they}} may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one <b>also</b> <b>involves</b> the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure. Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} bromide is a colourless gas, {{like all the}} hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen bromide}} at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as hydrobromic acid, which is a strong acid (pKa = −9) because the hydrogen bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H2O system <b>also</b> <b>involves</b> many hydrates HBr·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine anions and hydronium cations. Hydrobromic acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 124.3°C at 47.63g HBr per 100g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E

50|$|Stress relief bake {{should not}} be {{confused}} with annealing or tempering, which are heat treatments to increase ductility of a metal. Although those processes <b>also</b> <b>involve</b> heating the material to high temperatures and reduce residual stresses, they <b>also</b> <b>involve</b> a change in metallurgical properties, which may be undesired.|$|R
5|$|Jainism {{is perhaps}} the only {{religion}} {{in the world that}} requires all its adherents to follow a strict vegetarian diet. Vegetarian food that <b>also</b> <b>involves</b> more harm to the living beings such as roots, bulbs, multi seeded vegetables etc. are avoided by strict Jains. The importance of ahimsa manifests in many other ways in the daily life of Jains. For a layperson it means participating in business that results in least amount of violence to living beings. No furs, plumes or silk are worn. Use of leather is kept to a minimum and must in any event be from naturally dead animals. Food is usually eaten during the day unless unavoidable, since there is too much danger of injuring insects in cooking at night. The Jain will not use an open light nor leave a container of liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed; even with this precaution, liquids are always strained before use. Through the ages Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury, and this accounts for the disproportionate number who have entered banking, commerce and other mercantile trades.|$|E
5|$|World-class {{match play}} (i.e., {{a series of}} games between the same two opponents) often {{involves}} one or both players preparing one or two openings very deeply, and playing them repeatedly during the match. Preparation for such a match <b>also</b> <b>involves</b> analysis of those opening lines known to be played by the opponent. Fischer had been famous for his unusually narrow opening repertoire: for example, almost invariably playing 1. as White, and almost always playing the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defence as Black against 1.e4. He surprised Spassky by repeatedly switching openings, and by playing openings that he had never, or only rarely, played before (such as 1. as White, and Alekhine's Defence, the Pirc Defence, and the Paulsen Sicilian as Black). Even in openings that Fischer had played before in the match, he continually deviated from the variations he had previously played, almost never repeating the same line twice in the match.|$|E
