500|$|Tomlinson {{stayed on}} Lombard Street for <b>another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour,</b> then {{made his way}} to King William Street, toward two lines of police cordons, where police had [...] "kettled" [...] {{thousands}} of protesters near the Bank of England. At 7:10pm he doubled back on himself, walking up and down Change Alley where he encountered more cordons, and five minutes later was on Lombard Street again, crossed it, walked down Birchin Lane, and reached Cornhill at 7:10–7:15pm.|$|E
500|$|In Tokyo, MacArthur and {{his wife}} were at a luncheon at the American embassy for Senator Warren Magnuson and William Stern, {{executive}} vice president of Northwest Airlines, when Colonel Sidney Huff, MacArthur's aide and one of the [...] "Bataan gang" [...] who had escaped from Corregidor with the general in 1942, heard about the relief from commercial radio broadcast. Huff promptly informed Mrs. MacArthur, who in turn told the general. Japanese radio stations soon picked up the story, but the official notice would not arrive for <b>another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>Another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> dragged by, and now Dora {{turned to}} whisper to Dick.|$|E
60|$|<b>Another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour's</b> work {{took him}} to the top again, and a few minutes later he rejoined his companion.|$|R
6000|$|After <b>another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour's</b> effort Paynter had {{occasion}} to remark, [...] "It must have been rather a large dog." [...] There were already a heap of such white fragments at his feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope they}} will be up before dusk," [...] Dick Caister said. [...] "It will be dark in <b>another</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour.</b> These fellows are only waiting for that to make a rush. If they do, it is all up with us." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> passed. Even Harry was conscious, now, {{that there}} was a low dull sound in the air.|$|E
60|$|They {{waited for}} <b>another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour,</b> {{and then they}} heard a heavy crash {{on the other side}} of the stone barrier.|$|E
60|$|At length it {{was done}} {{and there was no}} sign of Hans. <b>Another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> passed and still no sign of Hans.|$|E
60|$|A mile or two {{further on}} the road again descended and the valley opened to a fertile country. <b>Another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour's</b> sharp riding brought them into Estrella. Their coming had {{probably}} been signaled, for the inhabitants evinced no sudden alarm as the little troop rode along the principal street. The women stood at the doors of the houses to look at them, the men were gathered in little knots at the corners; but all were unarmed, and Jack saw at once that there was no intention of offering resistance. He alighted {{at the door of the}} village inn, and in a few minutes two or three of the chief men in the village presented themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} this Archimandrite" [...] I said, [...] "and this Marine. Will you please give the boat's crew a drink now, and <b>another</b> in <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> if-- if Mr.----" ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the loss}} of his arm, Jackson managed to return to his trenches, {{claiming}} he only felt [...] "a numbing sensation". An officer applied a tourniquet to his arm, using a piece of string and a stick, and Jackson returned to no man’s land for <b>another</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> until he was satisfied there were no wounded men left on the battlefield.|$|R
60|$|In <b>another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> he was {{progressing}} rapidly, and, but for {{an exceptional}} word now and again, {{he found it}} very plain sailing.|$|E
60|$|<b>Another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> slipped by. Then {{the door}} to the cabin was opened, and both Baxters, Captain Langless, and the mate of the {{schooner}} appeared.|$|E
60|$|<b>Another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> went by, and {{the boys}} {{confined}} in the room {{on the third floor}} of the school building became more and more impatient.|$|E
5000|$|The {{violence}} in the Gem was {{not confined to the}} prostitutes, with the saloon being a frequent site of gunfights between drunken patrons; [...] and in one memorable instance, the memoirs of John S. McClintock reported a prostitute named [...] "Trixie" [...] having shot a large hole through the skull of a man who astounded everyone by surviving for <b>another</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour.</b>|$|R
60|$|Much may {{be done by}} kindness. By {{the time}} the curtain fell on the musical comedy which we had {{attended}} all was peace between the Nugget and myself. Supper cemented our friendship, and we drove back to my rooms on excellent terms with one <b>another.</b> <b>Half</b> an <b>hour</b> later he was snoring in the spare room, while I smoked contentedly before {{the fire in the}} sitting-room.|$|R
6000|$|I waited an {{hour and}} then {{concluded}} the thing was square. I slid down the tree, got the note, slipped along the fence till I struck the woods, and {{was back at the}} cave in <b>another</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour.</b> I opened the note, got near the lantern and read it to Bill. It was written with a pen in a crabbed hand, and the sum and substance of it was this: ...|$|R
60|$|But in <b>another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> Vincent had {{to bring}} the boat's head up to the wind, lower the lug, and tie down the last reef.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] {{the sailor}} said, with some surprise. [...] "The train for Petersburg {{does not go}} for <b>another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour.</b> What can I do for you?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> went by, {{and they}} came in sight {{of a number of}} lumber barges, all heavily loaded. The barges were being towed by a big tug.|$|E
30|$|Sycamore {{outer bark}} falls down by itself {{or can be}} peeled off by hand easily without cutting down the tree. It was {{collected}} and crushed as a sample source. It was boiled in water for 1  h, which was replaced with new water and boiled for <b>another</b> a <b>half</b> <b>hour.</b> After filtration, it was extracted thrice with hydrophilic organic solvents (e.g. methanol, acetone, ethanol, 2 -propanal) for 24  h at room temperature. The filtrates were combined and evaporated and the collected products used for analysis.|$|R
60|$|Marble {{then told}} me the {{substance}} of the conversation he had held with Captain Le Compte. The latter had expressed a sudden and violent impatience to be off--I understood the cause in a moment; he wished to separate Emily from her old acquaintance, as soon as possible--intending to put the schooner into the water for us, that very afternoon, and to sail himself in the morning. This was a sudden resolution, and the French were moving heaven and earth to carry it into effect. I confess to some little regret at hearing it, for it was pleasant to meet the Mertons in that unexpected manner, and the influence of woman in such a solitude is unusually great. I now told Marble of my discovery, and when he had got through with his expressions of wonder, I carried him to the tents, and led him into the presence of his old acquaintances. In consequence of this visit, I enjoyed <b>another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour's</b> tête à tête with Emily, Marble soon taking the Major to walk with him, beneath the trees.|$|R
50|$|The robbery {{came to an}} end at {{approximately}} 02:45. The staff, along with Mr Dixon's wife and son, were left locked in cash cages. However, one member of staff had a key to unlock the cage she was locked in; she was then able to free the others. It was still <b>another</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> before staff members, who had been tied up, managed to raise the alarm. Police officers arriving on the scene discovered staff, the manager and his family all bound, but physically unharmed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Goin' some," [...] Shorty exulted. [...] "We oughtn't to {{been there}} for <b>another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> to the least, accordin' to my reckonin'. I must 'a' been spreadin' my legs." ...|$|E
60|$|For Tharks {{they were}} wildly enthusiastic, and before <b>another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> had passed twenty mounted {{messengers}} were speeding across dead sea bottoms {{to call the}} hordes together for the expedition.|$|E
60|$|Three hours elapsed {{before the}} glare of the distant fires began to subside, <b>another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> passed, and then the band were formed up and moved along {{on the bank of the}} river.|$|E
50|$|Initially, the Irish {{defenders}} {{managed to}} protect the Church, holding off the attackers {{trying to get through}} the doors, but the Parliamentarians then placed numerous ladders against the many windows in the church and swarmed the building. For <b>another</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> fighting raged inside the church, until the depleted defenders retreated up the bell tower. Only sixty soldiers of the garrison remained at this point, and they thus accepted a call to surrender. However, after they had descended the tower and thrown their swords away, all were killed.|$|R
5000|$|.....Liverpool is {{the biggest}} port ... there was {{something}} to see from Dingle up to Bootle, and as far again as Birkenhead on the other side. Yellow water, bellowing steam ferries, white trans-atlantic liners, towers, cranes, stevedores, skiffs, shipyards, trains, smoke, chaos, hooting, ringing, hammering, puffing, the ruptured bellies of the ships, the stench of horses, the sweat, urine, and waste from all the continents of the world ... And if I heaped up words for <b>another</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour,</b> I wouldnt achieve the full number, confusion and expanse which is called Liverpool.|$|R
5000|$|According to Moffat and Gatiss, the BBC {{liked the}} pilot {{so much that}} they ordered three 90-minute films. However, the pilot version of [...] "A Study in Pink" [...] had been {{produced}} as a 60-minute film. The producers felt that they could not simply add <b>another</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> to the episode—they had to film it again. Producer Sue Vertue adds that additional footage to increase the length would not have matched because a different director of photography and a superior camera was used when filming the series.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will wait}} <b>another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour,</b> here; but I fear {{that no more}} will join us, for the Romans are drawn up all along the line where, alone, a descent could {{be made in the}} valley." ...|$|E
60|$|In <b>another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> the {{sun went}} down. Darkness comes on quickly in the Soudan, and in another {{quarter of an hour}} they had lost sight of their pursuers, who had gained about a mile upon them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! <b>another</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour.</b> Perhaps more. Mademoiselle {{has gone}} to the cathedral. If M. le Marquis will give himself the trouble to walk so far, he cannot fail to see Mademoiselle when she comes out of church." ...|$|E
60|$|Ralph had no {{difficulty}} in purchasing whisky, and be ordered the sergeant to serve out a tot to each {{man with his}} dinner and <b>another</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> later, and by seven o'clock there was scarcely one of the tired men who was not already asleep. The next morning they started at eight o'clock, having had a breakfast of potatoes before they fell in. Ralph rewarded the peasants generously for their hospitality, and the men set off in high spirits for their tramp, and reached Ballyporrit at half-past two in the afternoon.|$|R
50|$|DD Kashir {{became a}} 24-hour channel from 15 August 2000. The channel used to {{telecast}} a 14 and half-hour programme daily.

50|$|After 11:00 AM, the temple's mid day worship begins. After <b>half</b> an <b>hour,</b> rajabhoga (main offering) {{is offered}} to the deity. The pilgrims {{are not allowed to}} visit the sanctum for the next <b>half</b> an <b>hour.</b> Rajabhoga {{consists}} of cooked rice, dal, soup, cooked vegetables, ghee and curd. <b>Another</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> break is given to the deity at 2:30 AM. Devotees are then allowed to visit the sanctum upto 7:00 PM. In the evening worship, which begins at 6:00 PM, begins with the Divviti Salam (salute with torches) ceremony. Two men go round the temple; one holds a torch and the other plays a drum. The rituals offered in the evening are {{similar to that of the}} morning worship. The importance given to music is the major deviation. Night offering is provided to the deity. Devotees are allowed to have a glimpse of the deity for <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> from 8:30 PM. At 9:00 PM, sayana seva (sleeping ritual) is performed an the temple is closed.|$|R
