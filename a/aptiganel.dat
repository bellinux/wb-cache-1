5000|$|<b>Aptiganel</b> (Cerestat; CNS-1102) is an {{unsuccessful}} drug candidate which {{acts as a}} noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, and that was under development by Cambridge Neuroscience, Inc {{as a treatment for}} stroke. It has neuroprotective effects and was researched for potential use in the treatment of stroke, but despite positive results in animal studies, human trials showed limited efficacy, as well as undesirable side effects such as sedation and hallucinations, and clinical development was ultimately not continued.|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose—Aptiganel (CNS 1102) is a selective, noncompetitive {{antagonist}} {{that acts}} on the ion channel {{associated with the}} N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and is neuroprotective in experimental focal cerebral ischemia models at a plasma concentration of 10 ng/mL. In human volunteers, dose-limiting effects of <b>aptiganel</b> are blood pressure increases and central nervous system (CNS) excitation or depression. This study assessed the safety and tolerability of non–weight-adjusted doses of <b>aptiganel</b> in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Methods—This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter study in patients presenting within 24 hours of acute ischemic stroke. Ascending single intravenous bolus doses of <b>aptiganel</b> (3, 4. 5, 6, and 7. 5 mg) were assessed in 21 patients with a 3 : 1 active drug:placebo randomization schedule. In 15 subsequent patients, selected bolus doses were followed by constant intravenous infusion for 6 to 12 hours (6 mg plus 1 mg/h, n 510; then 4. 5 mg plus 0. 75 mg/h, n 515) in a 4 : 1 randomization schedule. Prospectively collected pharmacokinetic data guided selection of infusion rates. Neurological and functional status were recorded at entry and after 1 week, although the study was not designed to test efficacy. Results—Forty-six patients were randomized from 4 centers (3 in the United States and 1 in the United Kingdom) : 36 received <b>aptiganel</b> HCl, and 10 were given placebo. Hypertension and CNS events were commonly reported after a bolus dose of 7. 5 mg and after a 6 -mg bolus followed by an infusion of 1 mg/h. The lower regimen of 4. 5 -mg bolus followe...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{accepted}} that high concentrations of glutamate can destroy neurons, {{and this is the}} basis of the theory of excitotoxicity during brain injury such as stroke. Glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists such as Selfotel, <b>Aptiganel,</b> Gavestinel and others failed to show neuroprotective efficacy in human clinical trials or produced intolerable central nervous system adverse effects. The failure of these agents has been attributed to poor studies in animal models and to poorly designed clinical trials. We also speculate that NMDA receptor antagonism may have hindered endogenous mechanisms for neuronal survival and neuroregeneration. It remains to be proven in human stroke whether NMDA receptor antagonism can be neuroprotective...|$|E
40|$|Lot of {{advancement}} {{has taken}} place, {{not only in}} the management but also in the pathophysiology and imaging modalities in patients of stroke. Indolent chronic infections, particularly those due to H. pylori, have been identified as one of the risk factors. The mechanism of inflammation in inducing a precoagulant state has also been worked out. SPECT studies have detected ischaemic areas before appearance of CT abnormalities. CT angiography identifies abnormalities in the &#x 2032;circle of willis&#x 2032; in posterior circulation strokes much better, and helps weigh the risk versus benefit of thrombolysis. With experiance in use of r-TPA, the list of contra indications and precautions has become longer than its indications. Newer drugs like lubeluzole and edselen have also been recommended. Various other drugs e. g. <b>aptiganel</b> hydrochloride, MDL 28170, &#x 2032;basic fibroblast growth factor&#x 2032; and &#x 2032;superoxide dismutase&#x 2032; are at an experimental stage. The concept of a &#x 2032;stroke cocktail&#x 2032; may be in vogue soon. Controversies still exit regarding the exact indication of prophylactic anticoagulant and the &#x 2032;international normalized ratio&#x 2032; (INR) to be achieved. Guidelines have been laid down for the approach to patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. However, the paramount message in stroke care is dissipation of the concept of &#x 2032;brain attack&#x 2032;, amongst the primary care medical and para-medical personnel...|$|E
