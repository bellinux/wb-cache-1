25|$|In {{addition}} to standard holy days, most Christians observe many saints' days. <b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>might</b> give a small feast {{on his personal}} saint's day. The local voluntary association (called the maheber) connected with each church honors its patron saint with a special service and a feast {{two or three times}} a year.|$|E
25|$|Socrates gets Hippias {{to agree}} that the more a man knows about a subject, the better {{position}} he will be in to lie about it. He argues that the man who knows the subjects about which he tells lies, whether arithmetic, geometry, or astronomy, is twice as powerful as the man who does not know his subjects. Socrates never indicates what <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>might</b> stand to gain from lying about such matters, but brings the conversation back around to Achilles, and what kind of man Homer intended to portray.|$|E

25|$|The {{married couple}} formed a single unit {{in terms of}} {{external}} responsibility, especially for debt. The man was responsible for debts contracted by his wife, even before her marriage, {{as well as for}} his own; but he could use her as a mancipium (see above). Hence the Code allowed a proviso to be inserted in the marriage contract, that the wife should not be seized for her husband's pre-nuptial debts; but stipulated that then he was not responsible for her pre-nuptial debts, and, in any case, that both together were responsible for all debts contracted after marriage. <b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>might</b> make his wife a settlement by deed of gift, which gave her a life interest in part of his property, and he might reserve to her the right to bequeath it to a favorite child; but she could in no case leave it to her family. Although married, she always remained a member of her father's house—she is rarely named wife of A, but usually daughter of B, or mother of C.|$|E
500|$|Raised in a {{religious}} environment, Charles Darwin studied to be an Anglican clergyman. While eventually doubting parts of his faith, Darwin continued to help in church affairs, even while avoiding church attendance. Darwin stated {{that it would be}} [...] "absurd to doubt that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>might</b> be an ardent theist and an evolutionist". Although reticent about his religious views, in 1879 he wrote that [...] "I have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God. – I think that generally ... an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind." ...|$|E
500|$|Darwin {{remained}} {{close friends}} with the vicar of Downe, John Brodie Innes, and continued to play a leading part in the parish work of the church, but from around 1849 would {{go for a walk}} on Sundays while his family attended church. He considered it [...] "absurd to doubt that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>might</b> be an ardent theist and an evolutionist" [...] and, though reticent about his religious views, in 1879 he wrote that [...] "I have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God.– I think that generally ... an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind".|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} {{praise from}} critics with The Moving Picture World stating, [...] " [...] picture which touches {{the heart and}} arouses the strongest emotions. It can be readily understood how <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>might</b> become a maniac under such circumstances. The loss of a wife and daughter is sufficient to overthrow reason. That a man should be a hermit afterward seems not unusual. Then comes {{the excitement of the}} runaway, the rescue of the baby and the discovery of his daughter, with returning reason and love to follow during his declining years. The emotions will be strongly aroused by this picture, and that will make it popular. Whatever touches the heart is always popular, and this seems to appeal with unusual power." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror offered minor praise for the film for the production and its acting.|$|E
500|$|The {{harm done}} by Formosa lies in this,— that the {{character}} is utterly false, false to human nature and false to London life. She is a wretch, abominable almost beyond conception, {{so as to be}} odious, if known, to the most odious. She is sharper as well as prostitute,—and is false to all with whom she comes in contact, to those whom she is supposed to love and to those who love her. Her peculiar profession is represented as causing her no personal remorse. And yet she is exhibited to us as a fine creature, a noble woman, one whom <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>might</b> be honoured by loving;—and at last she ends with a success! ... That which is vile and dirty, squalid and miserable,—that, of which we may say that were its horrors known such knowledge would deter more thoroughly than any ignorance,—is exhibited as a bright existence, full of danger indeed, but still open to all that is noble, and capable of final success.|$|E
500|$|Others, like Harold Bloom, have {{emphasized}} the [...] "exhausted landscape", the completion, the finality of death, although [...] "Winter descends here as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>might</b> hope to die, with a natural sweetness". If death in itself is final, here {{it comes with a}} lightness, a softness, also pointing to [...] "an acceptance of process beyond the possibility of grief." [...] The progress of growth is no longer necessary; maturation is complete, and life and death are in harmony. The rich description of the cycle of the seasons enables the reader to feel a belonging [...] "to something larger than the self", as James O'Rourke expresses it, but the cycle comes to an end each year, analogous to the ending of single life. O'Rourke suggests that something of a fear of that ending is subtly implied {{at the end of the}} poem, although, unlike the other great odes, in this poem the person of the poet is entirely submerged, so there is at most a faint hint of Keats's own possible fear.|$|E

500|$|The Act was not {{effectively}} enforced, and did {{not address}} the working conditions of 'free children' (children working in mills who were not apprentices) who rapidly came to heavily outnumber the apprentices. [...] Regulating the way masters treated their apprentices was a recognised responsibility of Parliament and hence the Act itself was non-contentious, but coming between employer and employee to specify on what terms <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>might</b> sell his labour (or that of his child) was highly contentious. [...] Hence it was not until 1819 that an Act to limit the hours of work (and set a minimum age) for 'free children' working in cotton mills was piloted through Parliament by Peel and his son Robert (the future Prime Minister). [...] Strictly speaking, it is Peel's Cotton Mills and Factories Act of 1819 which (although also ineffective for want of a means of proper enforcement) paved the way for subsequent Factory Acts that would regulate the industry and set up effective means of regulation; but it is Peel's Act of 1802 which first recognised by legislation the evils of child labour in cotton mills that the Factory Acts addressed.|$|E
500|$|In 1943 Vaughan Williams {{conducted}} {{the premiere of}} his Fifth Symphony at the Proms. Its serene tone contrasted with the stormy Fourth, and led some commentators to think it a symphonic valediction. William Glock wrote that it was [...] "like {{the work of a}} distinguished poet who has nothing very new to say, but says it in exquisitely flowing language". The music Vaughan Williams wrote for the BBC to celebrate the end of the war, Thanksgiving for Victory, was marked by what the critic Edward Lockspeiser called the composer's characteristic avoidance of [...] "any suggestion of rhetorical pompousness". Any suspicion that the septuagenarian composer had settled into benign tranquillity was dispelled by his Sixth Symphony (1948), described by the critic Gwyn Parry-Jones as [...] "one of the most disturbing musical statements of the 20th century", opening with a [...] "primal scream, plunging the listener immediately into a world of aggression and impending chaos." [...] Coming as it did near the start of the Cold War, many critics thought its pianissimo last movement a depiction of a nuclear-scorched wasteland. The composer was dismissive of programmatic theories: [...] "It never seems to occur to people that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>might</b> just want to write a piece of music." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Ay," [...] he said aloud. There is no {{translation}} {{for this}} word {{and perhaps it}} is just a noise such as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>might</b> make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood.|$|E

2500|$|An overgown, tunic, or kirtle {{was usually}} worn over the shirt or doublet. [...] As with other outer garments, it was {{generally}} made of wool. Over this, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>might</b> also wear an over-kirtle, cloak, or a hood. Servants and working men wore their kirtles at various lengths, including as low as the knee or calf. [...] However the trend during the century was for hem-lengths to shorten for all classes.|$|E
2500|$|Jeremiah was {{sympathetic}} to {{as well as}} descended from the Northern Kingdom. Many of his first reported oracles are about, and addressed to, the Israelites at Samaria. He resembles the northern prophet Hosea, in his use of language, and examples of God's [...] relationship to Israel. Hosea {{seems to have been}} the first prophet to describe the desired relationship as an example of ancient Israelite marriage, where <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>might</b> be polygynous, while a woman was only permitted one husband. [...] Jeremiah often repeats Hosea's marital imagery (Jer. 2:2b–3; 3:1–5, 19–25; 4:1–2).|$|E
2500|$|Finally, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>might,</b> like Philip II, assume some prerogatives of godhood and not others. The first Attalid {{kings of}} Pergamum, were not gods, and {{supported}} a cult [...] of [...] Dionysus Cathegemon, as their ancestor; {{they put the}} picture of Philetaerus, the first prince, on the coins, rather than their own. Eventually, like the Seleucids, they acquired an eponymous priest, and put themselves on the coinage; but they still were not called gods before their deaths. Pergamum was usually allied with Rome, and this may have influenced the eventual Roman practice.|$|E

2500|$|Ned {{loved the}} Navy as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>might</b> love his own family. For the Navy was his family, the junior {{officers}} he trained and the enlisted men who {{did so much}} of the hand-labor in the boats. He served with distinction approaching perfection and, like his father, would then write about the things he'd seen and done... More than once I spoke with him about the psychological aspects of combat, and every time he told me what I needed to know, always from his own rich experiences. Ned was a serious student of history -- he wrote several splendid books on this subject -- and of human nature. What he didn't know had never happened.|$|E
2500|$|In {{imperial}} times, the praenomen {{became increasingly}} {{confused by the}} practices of the aristocracy. The emperors usually prefixed Imperator to their names as a praenomen, {{while at the same}} time retaining their own praenomina; but because most of the early emperors were legally adopted by their predecessors, and formally assumed new names, even these were subject to change. [...] Several members of the Julio-Claudian dynasty exchanged their original praenomina for cognomina, or received cognomina in place of praenomina at birth. [...] An emperor might emancipate or enfranchise large groups of people at once, all of whom would automatically receive the emperor's praenomen and nomen. [...] Yet another common practice beginning in the first century AD was to give multiple sons the same praenomen, and distinguish them using different cognomina; by the second century this was becoming the rule, rather than the exception. [...] Another confusing practice was the addition of the full nomenclature of maternal ancestors to the basic tria nomina, so that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>might</b> appear to have two praenomina, one occurring in the middle of his name.|$|E
2500|$|When Henry III or Edward I wanted {{money or}} advice from his subjects, he would order great churchmen, earls, and other great men {{to come to}} his Great Council; he would {{generally}} order the lesser men from towns and counties to gather and pick some men to represent them. For the evolution of this into a system of government, see Parliament; the English Order of Barons has evolved [...] those men who were individually ordered to attend Parliament, but held no other title; the chosen representatives, on the other hand, became the House of Commons. This order, called a writ, was not originally hereditary, or even a privilege; the recipient had to come to the Great Council at his own expense, vote on taxes on himself and his neighbors, acknowledge that he was the king's tenant-in-chief (which might cost him special taxes), and risked involvement in royal politics - or the king requesting a personal loan, or benevolence. Which men were ordered to Council varied from Council to Council; <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>might</b> be so ordered once, and never again - or all his life, but his son and heir might never go.|$|E
