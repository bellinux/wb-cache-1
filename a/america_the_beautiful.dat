[...] Shortly after The Coral Island was published, a paper titled The Scotsman praised him, saying [...] "Mr Ballantyne {{ought to be a}} decided favourite with young readers, for not content with introducing them to far distant lands- ranging from the cold and cheerless regions of North <b>America</b> to <b>the</b> <b>beautiful</b> islands of <b>the</b> Pacific he makes young boys the heroes of all his stories, endowing them with wonderful fortitude and perseverance. Coral Island has all the advantages of Mr. Ballantyne's former works; it is both instructive and amusing".|$|R

50|$|The environs of Sidney {{provides}} {{habitat for}} a {{diverse array of}} fish and wildlife, both terrestrial and marine, coming and going with the seasons. For this reason it is a growing mecca for bird watchers, whale watchers, scuba-divers and eco-tourism. Undoubtedly, Sidney's most famous inhabitant is the handsome bufflehead featured prominently on its coat of arms. The bufflehead {{is just one of}} many species of waterfowl that overwinter in Shoal Harbour Migratory Bird Sanctuary, one of the oldest marine sanctuaries on the west coast. Sidney overlooks Sidney Channel Important Bird Area, an internationally recognized site of major importance for many species of seabirds such as common murres, rhinoceros auklet, pigeon guillemots, murrelets, three species of cormorants, and several gull species, including the unusual Heermann's gull. One of Sidney's most famous residents is the bald eagle which has nested continuously in 'Beaufort Grove' for twenty-five years. In summer large numbers of great blue herons gather in Roberts Bay (part of Shoal Harbour Sanctuary) to feed on the abundant small fish. A variety of songbirds (towhees, American robins, Bewick's and winter wrens, bushtits, chickadees etc.) are found in back yards, along with the common northwestern crow, and introduced species such as the common starling and house sparrow.

The area was made a national park on March 4, 1921. It is the smallest national park by area in the United States and could fit into the largest National Park in the United States, Wrangell-St. Elias National Park, almost 2,400 times. Since Hot Springs National Park is the oldest park maintained by the National Park Service, it was the first to receive its own US quarter in April 2010 as part of the <b>America</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beautiful</b> Quarters coin series.|$|E
60|$|In birds {{there are}} {{a large number of}} {{peculiar}} genera of which we need mention {{only a few of the}} more important, as the grass-hopper warblers (Locustella) with seven species, the Accentors with twelve species, and about a dozen other genera of warblers, including the robins; the bearded titmouse and several allied genera; the long-tailed titmice forming the genus Acredula; the magpies, choughs, and nut-crackers; a host of finches, among which the bullfinches (Pyrrhula) and the buntings (Emberiza) are the {42} most important. The true pheasants (Phasianus) are wholly Palæarctic, except one species in Formosa, as are several genera of wading birds. Though the reptiles of cold countries are few as compared with those of the tropics, the Palæarctic region in its warmer portions has a considerable number, and among these are many which are peculiar to it. Such are four genera of snakes, seven of lizards, five of frogs and toads, and twelve of newts and salamanders; while of fresh-water fishes {{there are a}}bout twenty peculiar genera.[7] Among insects we may mention the elegant Apollo butterflies of the Alps as forming a peculiar genus (Parnassius), only found elsewhere in the Rocky Mountains of North <b>America,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>beautiful</b> genus Thais of the south of Europe and Sericinus of North China are equally remarkable. Among other insects we can only now refer to the great family of Carabidæ, or predaceous ground-beetles, which are immensely numerous in this region, there being about fifty peculiar genera; while the large and handsome genus Carabus, with its allies Procerus and Procrustes, containing nearly 300 species, is almost wholly confined to this region, and would alone serve to distinguish it zoologically from all other parts of the globe.|$|R
