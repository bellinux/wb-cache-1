40|$|The feeding {{habits of}} the <b>axillary</b> <b>seabream,</b> Pagellus acarne (Risso, 1810), from the Gulf of Tunis were {{investigated}} in relation to season, sex and fish size (juveniles TL < 14. 5 cm and adults TL ≥ 14. 5 cm). A total of 536 specimens (males, females, unsexed and hermaphroditic), ranging between 11. 0 and 25. 2 cm TL, were collected with trammel nets from June 2005 to July 2006. Their stomach contents were analysed. Of {{the total number of}} examined stomachs, 279 stomachs were empty (Vacuity index, VI = 52 %). The VI did not reveal significant seasonal differences when all of the specimens were analysed together; however, significant seasonal variations were observed for females. The diet of the <b>axillary</b> <b>seabream</b> was composed of 36 different prey species. The most important prey were Arthropoda, Mollusca and Echinodermata. Both the dietary indices and the Spearman’s coefficient of correlation indicated seasonal variations in the diet. The diet was more diversified in adults than in juveniles. The <b>axillary</b> <b>seabream</b> fed {{on a wide range of}} prey items, endofauna and nekton, and can be considered a carnivorous and euryphagous predator...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess trace metal contents, biochemical composition and growth performance of <b>axillary</b> <b>seabream</b> (Pagellus acarne Risso, 1827) cultured in a copper alloy mesh cage. A total of 400 <b>axillary</b> <b>seabream</b> (initial mean weight: 176. 0 ± 14. 0 g), a new candidate species for the Mediterranean aquaculture, were stocked into a high-density polyethylene frame gravity cage and fed a commercial seabream diet for a period of 6 months. At the end of the feeding trial, fish reached a final weight of 264. 8 ± 16. 8 g with a weight increase of 88. 8 g and a feed conversion rate of 2. 51. Overall, relative growth rate, specific growth rate and feed conversion ratio were satisfactory and comparable to the pelagic fishes such as gilthead seabream or European seabass, which are presently the main fish species for the Mediterranean aquaculture industry. Trace elements in fish grown in copper alloy net cages over a 6 -month period showed satisfactory results, as the metal concentrations in fish tissues such as liver, skin, muscle and gills were below the reported upper limits for human consumption, indicating that copper alloy net is an acceptable and safe material for finfish cage aquaculture. Furthermore, from the growth performance data obtained in the present study, it can be concluded that <b>axillary</b> <b>seabream</b> showed potential for cage farming, and thus is a promising new candidate for the Mediterranean aquaculture industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{increase}} in cod end mesh size from 65 to 70 and 80 mm and a change of mesh configuration from 65 mm diamond to 65 mm square mesh on the size selectivity of horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), hake (Merluccius merluccius) and <b>axillary</b> <b>seabream</b> (Pagellus acarne) of the shallow groundfish assemblage off the Portuguese southwest coast were evaluated. The increase in mesh size had a small but significant effect on size selectivity for the three species, while the change in mesh configuration led to a much more pronounced increase in the selectivity parameters. For horse mackerel, the L 50 estimates ranged from 14. 4 to 16. 0 cm in the diamond mesh cod ends-values that are close to the minimum landing size of 15 cm. For hake, L 50 of 17. 0 and 18. 3 cm were estimated for the 70 and 80 mm diamond cod ends respectively, while for the <b>axillary</b> <b>seabream</b> the L 50 estimated was 13. 9 cm for the 80 mm diamond mesh cod end. These values are well below the minimum landing sizes of 27 and 18 cm for these species. The corresponding estimates in the square mesh cod end were 21. 9, 32. 4 and 19. 6 cm, with the loss of a high percentage (76 %) of horse mackerel above the minimum landing size. For all the cod ends tested, the observed retention was presented as a function of maximum girth/mesh perimeter, which allowed {{a better understanding of the}} selection process for the species in study. Selectivity estimates for horse mackerel and hake were also compared to those obtained by Campos et al. (2003) for the same species in 1993 off the south coast, where they are captured as a by-catch in the crustacean fishery...|$|E
40|$|<b>Axillary</b> <b>seabream,</b> Pagellus acarne, {{caught by}} longlines in the Algarve (Southern Portugal), were sampled between August 1995 and August 1996. Age was studied by {{counting}} growth increments on otoliths and the estimated von Bertalanffy parameters were Linf = 28. 82 cm, K = 0. 29 year- 1 and t 0 = - 1. 47 year {{for males and}} Linf = 32. 30 cm, K = 0. 18 year- 1 and t 0 = - 2. 56 year for females. Evidence of the annual periodicity of the deposition of increments was found by marginal increment analyses. Macroscopic analysis of the gonads and the gonad somatic index showed that reproduction occurred over an extensive period of time, from May to November. Lengths at first maturity were 18. 10 and 17. 60 cm for males and females, respectively. This species was characterized as being a protandric hermaphrodite. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} spontaneous melanotic lesions {{in the skin}} of <b>axillary</b> <b>seabream,</b> Pagellus acarne (Risso) from a defined area of the Portuguese Coast, located in Cabo da Roca and Foz do Arelho. The lesions corresponded to black pigmentation spots on {{the skin of the}} head, fins, lips and conjunctiva and, additionally, black nodules on the skin of the head and lips. In some specimens, the nodular formations in the head changed their anatomical conformation. Histologically, there were melanophores scattered along the basement membrane or forming aggregates in the dermis, infiltrating the subcutaneous tissue but not invading the adjacent muscle tissue. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the macroscopic and microscopic features of the pigmented lesions. These fish show sessile hyperpigmented lesions (spots) that correspond to proliferative lesions of melanophores in the dermis and nodular lesions that correspond to neoplastic lesions, melanophoromas. The melanophores in such lesions showed high concentration of melanin in the cytoplasm, moderate pleomorphism and compact distribution throughout all of the dermis...|$|E
