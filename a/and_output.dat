The definition of a DMU is generic and flexible and includes different consumable or non-consumable inputs <b>and</b> <b>outputs.</b> A set of weights are determined <b>and</b> the <b>outputs</b> <b>and</b> inputs are aggregated separately with regard to these weights to form a ratio as efficiency (Cooper et al. 2007).|$|R

5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, stiffness and damping. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements {{are used in the}} body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input <b>and</b> <b>output).</b> Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.|$|E

Mechanical filter designs often have the resonators coupled with steel or nickel-iron wires, but on some designs, especially older ones, nickel wire may be {{used for the}} input <b>and</b> <b>output</b> rods. This is because it is possible to wind the transducer coil directly on to a nickel coupling wire since nickel is slightly magnetostrictive. However, it is not strongly so and coupling to the electrical circuit is weak. This scheme also has the disadvantage of eddy currents, a problem that is avoided if ferrites are used instead of nickel.|$|E

40|$|Data envelopment {{analysis}} (DEA) is a non-parametric data oriented {{method for}} evaluating relative {{efficiency of the}} number of decision making units (DMUs) based on pre-selected inputs <b>and</b> <b>outputs.</b> In some real DEA applications, the large number of inputs <b>and</b> <b>outputs,</b> in comparison with the number of DMUs, is a pitfall that could have major influence on the efficiency scores. Recently, an approach was introduced which aggregates collected inputs <b>and</b> <b>outputs</b> {{in order to reduce the}} number of inputs <b>and</b> <b>outputs</b> iteratively. The purpose of this paper is to show that there are three drawbacks in this approach: instability due to existence of an infinitesimal epsilon, iteratively which can be improved to just one iteration, and providing non-radial inputs <b>and</b> <b>outputs</b> <b>and</b> then capturing them. In order to illustrate the applicability of the improved approach, a real data set involving 14 large branches of National Iranian Gas Company (NIGC) is utilized. Web of Science 27053352...|$|R
