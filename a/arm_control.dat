50|$|The {{original}} Canadarm {{was capable}} of deploying and retrieving payloads weighing up to 332.5 kg in space. In the mid-1990s the <b>arm</b> <b>control</b> system was redesigned to increase the payload capability to 3293 kg {{in order to support}} space station assembly operations. While able to maneuver payloads with the mass of a loaded bus in space, the arm motors cannot lift the arm's own weight when on the ground. NASA therefore developed a model of the arm for use at its training facility within the Johnson Space Center located in Houston, Texas. The Canadarm can also retrieve, repair and deploy satellites, provide a mobile extension ladder for extravehicular activity crew members for work stations or foot restraints, and be used as an inspection aid to allow the flight crew members to view the orbiter's or payload's surfaces through a television camera on the Canadarm.|$|E

After a discussion of the various weapons that are covered by <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> processes, and the legal regimes that accompany these, the chapter proceeds to outline Some {{of the ways in which}} <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> can be conceptualised and how various schools of thought in international relations can be related to <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> practices. We then look at the specific case of the nuclear weapons regime, as more states acquire nuclear weapons, and as calls increase for the elimination of these particular weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). The chapter also examines how a number of key states have been involved in upholding various <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> and disarmament regimes in the contemporary period...|$|R
40|$|The {{intensely}} adversarial {{relationship between}} India and Pakistan {{is marked by}} military rivalry, mutual distrust, and suspicion. The most dividing disagreement has been over the Kashmir region. An inability to discuss the Kashmir issue has prevented discussion on other important issues. Since there is little prospect of detente, {{at least in the}} near-term, the question is whether this rivalry can be contained by other means, such as <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> approaches. Conventional <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> has been applied flexibly and successfully in some regions to reduce threat-perceptions and achieve reassuring military stability. Some lessons from other international models might be applied to the India/Pakistan context. This paper discusses the status of conventional <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> in South Asia, the dominant Indian and Pakistani perceptions about <b>arms</b> <b>control,</b> the benefits that could be derived from <b>arms</b> <b>control,</b> as well as the problems and prospects of <b>arms</b> <b>control.</b> It also discusses existing conventional <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> agreements at the regional and global levels as well as the potential role of cooperative monitoring technology...|$|R
40|$|Most robotic {{grasping}} tasks {{assume a}} stationary or fixed object. In this paper, we explore {{the requirements for}} grasping a moving object.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> enhances nonproliferation efforts. This article examines interactions between <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> proposals in the near- to mid-term and nonproliferation, {{and argues that}} some <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> actually provides incentives for increased proliferation. Specifically, unilateral <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> may lead to increased proliferation. Bilateral <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> has shown little if any impact on nonproliferation efforts. Multilateral <b>arms</b> <b>control,</b> however, may well strengthen the nonproliferation regime (the general regime, not simply the treaty). Another areas of interest is {{the interaction between the}} prohibitions on chemical and biological weapons and nuclear proliferation. Here, I argue that retaining the option to respond to biological use with nuclear weapons does not hinder nonproliferation efforts. Finally, I suggest that a unilateral and absolute no-first-use commitment by the United States would actually encourage the proliferation of nuclear weapons...|$|R
40|$|The task of this {{research}} is to explore the relationship between <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> and national security. The author suggests that national security issues must dominate <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> initiatives and that the military command establishment should have an expanded role in shaping current <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> initiatives. The author considers two case studies to analyze this relationship. The first case study involves cruise missiles and reveals how issues such as politics, budgets, military missions, technology, stability and verification can impact on <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> negotiations and national security. The second case study shows the control that the military can and should exert in areas dealing with both <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> and national security interests.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} history of the community of nuclear <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> experts in the United States during the middle and later years of the Cold War, the age of thermonuclear ballistic missiles. <b>Arms</b> <b>control</b> experts were, in many interesting ways, both insiders and outsiders to the American "nuclear state. " The dissertation begins by exploring the formation of strategic <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> in the years leading up to 1960, showing how <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> emerged from the mixing of local communities of disarmament advocates and theorists of nuclear deterrence. Rather than inevitable doctrinal unity, early <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> was highly local and contingent. In particular, the crucial concept of "stability" was open to multiple interpretations. In the 1960 s, <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> problems motivated groundbreaking scientific research. Elite contract consultants to the government contemplated the use of lasers as weapons against ballistic missiles. As consultants performed calculations and experiments in the context of classified discussions and studies, they founded a new field of physics called nonlinear optics. In the late 1960 s, strategic <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> became a public issue during a complex political dispute over missile defense. <b>Arms</b> <b>control</b> experts mediated and fueled this controversy by participating in a surprising range of activity, rallying alongside local residents whose neighborhoods would be impacted by missile defense installations, and criticizing defense policy in Congressional testimony-even as they worked their connections to the White House. In the 1960 s and 1970 s arms controllers shaped a changing institutional landscape for the support of <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> expertise. They built <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> into a new government agency, and later drew on the resources of philanthropic foundations to create major university <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> centers. By the 1980 s, <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> reached peak public visibility amid controversy over the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initiative. This dissertation uses the private papers and correspondence of numerous experts, a wide range of <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> publications, and government records to explore the diverse practices of <b>arms</b> <b>control.</b> It engages a wider discussion among historians about the status of Cold War elites, the relationship between experts and the American state, and the character of scientific knowledge during the Cold War. by Benjamin Tyler Wilson.
