5|$|In September 1792 Heywood was court-martialed {{and with}} five others {{was sentenced to}} hang. However, the court {{recommended}} mercy for Heywood, and King George III pardoned him. In a rapid change of fortune he found himself favoured by senior officers, and after the resumption of his career received a series of promotions that gave him his first command {{at the age of}} 27 and made him a post-captain at 31. He remained in the navy until 1816, building a respectable career as a hydrographer, and then enjoyed a long and peaceful retirement. The extent of Heywood's true guilt in the mutiny has been clouded by contradictory statements and possible false testimony. During his trial powerful family connections worked on his behalf, and he later benefited from the Christian family's generally fruitful efforts to demean Bligh's character and present the mutiny as <b>an</b> <b>understandable</b> reaction to an unbearable tyranny. Contemporary press reports, and more recent commentators, have contrasted Heywood's pardon with the fate of his fellow prisoners who were hanged, all lower-deck sailors without wealth or family influence.|$|E
25|$|Speech {{production}} is {{process by which}} a thought in the brain is converted into <b>an</b> <b>understandable</b> auditory form. This is a multistage mechanism that involves many {{different areas of the}} brain. The first stage is planning, where the brain constructs words and sentences that turn the thought into <b>an</b> <b>understandable</b> form. This occurs primarily in the inferior frontal cortex, specifically in an area known as Broca's area. Next, the brain must plan how to physically create the sounds necessary for speech by linking the planned speech with known sounds, or phonemes. While the location of these associations is not known, it is known that the supplementary motor area {{plays a key role in}} this step. Finally, the brain must signal for the words to actually be spoken. This is carried out by the premotor cortex and the motor cortex.|$|E

They also developed <b>an</b> <b>understandable</b> way of defining the islands of the Indian Ocean in their navigational reach.

25|$|A rival {{conclusion}} by {{some historians}} (Terraine, Sheffield, Duffy, Chickering, Herwig and Philpott et al.) {{is that there}} was no strategic alternative for the British in 1916 and that <b>an</b> <b>understandable</b> horror at British losses is insular, given the millions of casualties borne by the French and Russian armies since 1914. This school of thought sets the battle in a context of a general Allied offensive in 1916 and notes that German and French writing on the battle puts it in a continental perspective.|$|E
25|$|Boobbyer {{joined the}} MRA {{movement}} whilst at Oxford. After finishing at university, {{he went on}} a rugby tour to Japan, {{but at the end}} of the tour he stayed on to work with an international MRA group which had the aim of promoting reconciliation following World War II. He devoted the rest of his life to his MRA work, and never subsequently played sport at a serious level. He later travelled for the movement to the Philippines, the USA and India, amongst many other places. He was a fine public speaker, able to put across spiritual themes in <b>an</b> <b>understandable</b> and sympathetic way.|$|E

25|$|Another {{view is that}} a stutter (stammer) is {{a complex}} tic. This view is held for the {{following}} reasons. It always arises from repetition of sounds or words. Young children like repetition and the more tense they are feeling, the more they like this outlet for their tension – <b>an</b> <b>understandable</b> and quite normal reaction. They are capable of repeating all types of behaviour. The more tension that is felt, the less one likes change. The more change, the greater can be the repetition. So, when a 3 year old finds {{he has a new}} baby brother or sister he may start repeating sounds. The repetitions can become conditioned and automatic and ensuing struggles against the repetitions result in prolongations and blocks in his speech. More boys stammer than girls, in the ratio of 3–4 boys : 1 girl. This is because the male Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis is more active. Whilst they are pumping out more cortisol than females under the same provocation, they can be tense or anxious and become repetitive.|$|E

The article, titled [...] "The Problem of Increasing Human Energy", appeared in the June, 1900 edition of the magazine. He explained the superiority of the wireless system he envisioned but the article was more of a lengthy philosophical treatise than <b>an</b> <b>understandable</b> scientific description of his work illustrated with what were to become iconic images of Tesla and his Colorado Springs experiments.|$|E

500|$|Churches of Christ seek to {{practice}} {{the principle of the}} Bible being the only source to find doctrine (known elsewhere as sola scriptura). The Bible is generally regarded as inspired and inerrant. Churches of Christ generally see the Bible as historically accurate and literal, unless scriptural context obviously indicates otherwise. Regarding church practices, worship, and doctrine, there is great liberty from congregation to congregation in interpreting what is Biblically permissible, as congregations are not controlled by a denominational hierarchy. Their approach to the Bible is driven by the [...] "assumption that the Bible is sufficiently plain and simple to render its message obvious to any sincere believer". Related to this is an assumption that the Bible provides <b>an</b> <b>understandable</b> [...] "blueprint" [...] or [...] "constitution" [...] for the church.|$|E

She wore a Mugler leather coat with pointy shoulder pads, {{along with an}} admiral cap, a big leather belt, and grommet covered boots. Vanessa Franko from The Press-Enterprise opined that she [...] "dressed like a military-inspired dominatrix" [...] for the performance. Peter Larsen from the same newspaper thought that [...] "Scheiße" [...] was <b>an</b> <b>understandable</b> choice as the opening song, [...] "its musical elements fitting neatly with the electronic dance music that dominates {{a huge part of}} the festival these days." [...] The track is also part of the setlist of the Joanne World Tour (2017-18). Gaga wears a fringe-covered black leather jacket for the performance, which was costum-made for her by Alexander Wang, along with fishnets and black thigh-high boots.|$|E
500|$|Development of Final Fantasy IX began before Square had {{finished}} development on Final Fantasy VIII. The game {{was developed in}} Hawaii as a compromise to developers living in the United States. As the series' last game on the PlayStation, Sakaguchi envisioned a [...] "reflection" [...] on the older titles of the series. [...] Leading up to its release, Sakaguchi called Final Fantasy IX his favorite Final Fantasy game as [...] "it's closest to [...] ideal view of what Final Fantasy should be". This shift was also a response to demands from fans and other developers. Additionally, the team wanted to create <b>an</b> <b>understandable</b> story with deep character development; {{this led to the}} creation of Active Time Events. The scenario for the game was written by Sakaguchi. He began early planning on it around July 1998. Director Hiroyuki Ito had the idea to make the protagonist Zidane flirtatious towards women.|$|E

500|$|Literature scholar Tonia Payne {{has written}} that [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] {{is an example of}} ecocriticism, wherein Le Guin critiques the idea that human beings are {{separate}} from their natural environment. The premise of the novella involves human beings who live their entire lives on a ship in interstellar space, and who therefore have to create a new reality for themselves, a notion also explored in Le Guin's short story [...] "Newton's Sleep". The inhabitants of Discovery become unable to relate to representations of Earth. Some, like Hsing and Luis, still try to understand Ti Chiu, keeping in mind their position {{as a part of a}} continuum of people supposed to colonize a new planet. For others, this new reality takes the form of the religious beliefs of the cult of Bliss. These beliefs are portrayed as <b>an</b> <b>understandable</b> attempt to adjust to the reality of spaceflight. A review by Publishers Weekly identified a similar theme, common to the other stories in the [...] "Birthday of the World" [...] collection, of characters coming to terms with the world they live in.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Clubs Alex McCown-Levy graded {{the episode}} a [...] "B", calling it [...] "a {{standard}} first episode back, {{in that it}} once again {{does a lot of}} table-setting, and not always in the most compelling manner". Levy felt that Ghost Rider's introduction was handled well for non-comic fans discovering the character with the show, but that the new positions of the series' main characters were more interesting and should have been focused on more. Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush said, [...] "I'm nervous for Season 4 overall, especially if said reinvention doesn't goose the ratings like Marvel and ABC hope, but 'The Ghost' is reason enough for some casual optimism." [...] He was positive about the new similarities to the darker series Daredevil, but felt that the series [...] "doesn’t have the firmest handle" [...] on Ghost Rider, either [...] "who Reyes himself is in relation to his murderous alter-ego", or in the blend of practical and digital effects—"the finished product isn't seamless just yet". He said, [...] "The junkyard battle with Daisy [...] was <b>an</b> <b>understandable</b> highlight", and praised the episode's smaller character moments like [...] "the moment of Daisy feeling as though she deserves to lose her life in battle, only for the Rider to silently disagree." [...] Rob Leane at Den of Geek compared the series' new status quo to Red Dwarf VIII and called it and many of the season's storylines being set up as [...] "pretty strong", but [...] "nothing grabbed [...] attention" [...] like the introduction of Ghost Rider, which Leane felt was [...] "a complete slam-dunk". He praised the effects for Ghost Rider and his car, and Luna's performance.|$|E
500|$|When first announced, XV {{used the}} mythos of Fabula Nova Crystallis, {{described}} by Kitase as [...] "a backdrop and starting point" [...] for the story. For Versus XIII, Nomura {{decided to focus}} more on the world and on realistic human characters. The terminology of the mythos, including the concept of l'Cie (magically imbued warriors burdened with a pre-determined task), was originally present in Versus XIII. A key figure in the mythos, the Goddess Etro, was originally represented in-game in a piece of artwork by Amano and was a key deity worshiped in the game world. During the transition process between Versus XIII and XV, the game [...] "disconnected" [...] from the mythos' core framework, existing as a thematic base for the world and story without being overtly expressed. While the adjustments were being decided upon, it was chosen to keep the mythos as part of XV, as much of the world was built upon it and would lose a lot of its substance if removed entirely. Instead, the team chose to adjust the mythos to fit the game's modern setting. Specific terminology, such as [...] "l'Cie" [...] and [...] "fal'Cie", was removed so the game would retain an individual identity and introduce the concepts in <b>an</b> <b>understandable</b> way. A common theme that carried over into XV was defined by Tabata as humans chosen by the crystal placing their lives at risk. The revised cosmology drew inspiration from Japanese folklore and various Western mythologies. The game's summoned monsters, referred to in-game as [...] "Astrals", were designed to play integral parts in the story and world as opposed to being simple monsters to be called into battle. They were intelligent beings that Noctis needed to forge a pact with rather than simply commanding them. Due to their key role in the story, the staff chose traditional Final Fantasy summons such as Leviathan and Titan instead of creating ones unique to the game.|$|E

2500|$|Degas {{is often}} {{identified}} as an Impressionist, <b>an</b> <b>understandable</b> but insufficient description.
