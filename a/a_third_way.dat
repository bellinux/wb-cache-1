The approach he undertook, of engaging combatants in conversation and working toward <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>way,</b> seeking to find common cause between opposing sides by aligning needs and desires, typifies the Anabaptist approach toward conflict and work in international development.|$|E
25|$|Special binders {{are used}} in air-set sands to produce core at room temperature. These sands do not require a gas {{catalyst}} because organic binders and a curing catalyst are mixed together in the sand which initiates the curing process. The only disadvantage with this is that after the catalyst is mixed in there is a short time to use the sand. <b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>way</b> to produce room temperature cores is by shell molding.|$|E
25|$|The {{base number}} of Mixtec nouns is singular. Pluralisation is {{effected}} {{by means of}} various grammatical and lexical tools. For example, a noun's number can be implicit if the phrase uses a plural pronoun (first person inclusive only) or if one of various verb affixes that modify the meaning are used: -koo and -ngoo (suffixes) and ka- (prefix). <b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>way</b> to indicate a plural is the (untranslatable) particle jijná'an, which can be placed before or after verbs, pronouns, or nouns.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>way</b> are non-Jewish organisations, mystery schools, {{initiation}} bodies, fraternities {{and secret}} societies, {{the most popular}} of which are Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism and the Golden Dawn, although hundreds of similar societies claim a kabbalistic lineage. These derive from syncretic combinations of Jewish kabbalah with Christian, occultist or contemporary New Age spirituality. As a separate spiritual tradition in Western esotericism since the Renaissance, with different aims from its Jewish origin, the non-Jewish traditions differ significantly and do not give an accurate representation of the Jewish spiritual understanding (or vice versa).|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>way</b> of {{understanding}} Casimir forces has been suggested, based on canonical macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. In this interpretation, {{there exists a}} ground (vacuum) state of the coupled system of matter and fields, which determines the ground-state properties of the electromagnetic field, giving rise to a force. The Casimir force is fundamentally a property of the coupled system of matter and fields, in which {{the interaction between the}} plates is mediated by the zero-point fields. In more traditional interpretations, however, the emphasis has fallen either on the electromagnetic field or the fluctuating material in the plates.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{engaging}} with the Italian Socialist Party, he later adhered {{to an independent}} humanitarian socialism, while maintaining a commitment to radical political and social reform throughout his life. Salvemini offered significant leadership to political refugees in the United States. His prolific writings shaped the attitudes of U.S. policymakers {{during and after the}} Second World War. His transatlantic exile experience endowed him with new insights and a fresh perspective to explain the rise of fascism, while shaping the memory of the war and political life in Italy after 1945. He advocated <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>way</b> between Communists and Christian Democracy for post-war Italy.|$|E

25|$|The {{approach}} of Cartan and Weyl, using connection 1-forms {{on the frame}} bundle of , gives <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>way</b> to understand the Riemannian connection. They noticed that parallel transport dictates that a path in the surface be lifted to a path in the frame bundle so that its tangent vectors lie in a special subspace of codimension one in the three-dimensional tangent space of the frame bundle. The projection onto this subspace is defined by a differential 1-form on the orthonormal frame bundle, the connection form. This enabled the curvature properties of the surface to be encoded in differential forms on the frame bundle and formulas involving their exterior derivatives.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>third</b> <b>way</b> is electrodialysis: an {{electric}} current between two plates attracts the wine ions and eliminates them. However, this solution not only acts on tartaric acid but also other compounds especially potassium {{which is responsible}} for the formation of insoluble bitartrate and also modifies the organoleptic qualities. However, it does allow a definitive stabilization. Reports of high tartaric stability in white wines matured on lees has led to research in this area. A protein from the hydrolyzate of the yeast (mannoproteins) allows salts of tartar to keep their solubility. The addition of this compound industrially permits a good quality stabilization. This solution is the least expensive for energy and refrigeration equipment and does not alter the aromatic perception of wine. Nevertheless, tests conducted by the Cooperative Institute for Wine of Languedoc-Roussillon did not show conclusive effectiveness.|$|E
500|$|Znaniecki {{characterized}} {{the world as}} being caught within two contrary modes of reflection; idealism and realism. He proposed <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>way,</b> which he called [...] "culturalism". His culturalism {{was one of the}} founding ideas of modern antipositivist and antinaturalist sociology.

500|$|Crowley {{believed}} in the objective existence of magic, which he chose to spell [...] "Magick", an older archaic spelling of the word. He provided various different definitions of this term over his career. In his book Magick in Theory and Practice, Crowley defined Magick as [...] "the Science and Art of causing change to occur in conformity with Will". He also told his disciple Karl Germer that [...] "Magick is getting into communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane than ours. Mysticism is the raising of oneself to their level." [...] Crowley saw Magick as <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>way</b> between religion and science, giving The Equinox the subtitle of [...] "The Method of Science; the Aim of Religion". Within that journal he expressed positive sentiments toward science and the scientific method, and urged magicians to keep detailed records of their magical experiments, [...] "The more scientific the record is, the better". His understanding of magic was also influenced {{by the work of}} the anthropologist James Frazer, in particular the view that magic was a precursor to science in a cultural evolutionary framework. Unlike Frazer however, Crowley did not see magic as a survival from the past that required eradication, but rather he believed that magic had to be adapted to suit the new age of science.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{historian}} Janet Oppenheim, De Morgan's wife Sophia was a convinced spiritualist but De Morgan shared <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>way</b> {{position on}} spiritualist phenomena which she {{defined as a}} [...] "wait-and-see position", he was neither a believer nor a skeptic, instead his viewpoint was that the methodology of the physical sciences does not automatically exclude psychic phenomena and that such phenomena may be explainable in time by the possible existence of natural forces which as yet physicists had not identified.|$|E
2500|$|To {{think about}} social {{transformation}} programmatically, one must first mark the direction one wants society to move in, and then identify {{the first steps}} {{with which we can}} move in that direction. In this way we can formulate proposals at points along the trajectory, be they relatively close to how things are now or relatively far away. This provides <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>way</b> between revolution and reform. It is revolutionary reform, where one has a revolutionary vision, but acts on that vision in a sequence of piecemeal reforms. As Unger puts it, transformative politics is [...] "not about blueprints; it is about pathways. It is not architecture; it is music".|$|E

40|$|The <b>Third</b> <b>Way</b> aims {{to work in}} the {{interests}} of people at large. Among other topics, the emphasis will be placed on the inclusive nature of the <b>Third</b> <b>Way</b> and how it can play a decisive role in reviving economies, protecting long cherished social programs, responding to the challenges of globalization and the rigours of technology. Although I don't necessarily agree with all aspects or policy associated with either or both Democratic and Labour views on economic and political questions in general, I'll attempt to assess, comment on, analyze and try to shed some light on a political and economic trend which seems to have caught the imagination of leading politicians worldwide. It will be shown that the <b>Third</b> <b>Way</b> can be the right alternative, both in terms of theory and realism. We will look at how <b>Third</b> <b>Way</b> principles can work for a country, while keeping in mind that what's good for one state may not be so for another. <b>As</b> the <b>Third</b> <b>Way</b> is still in its infancy, this study will explore how the issues of consensus-building, globalization, development, science, technology and social questions, and how we react to them, can contribute to the overall effectiveness of <b>a</b> truly <b>Third</b> <b>Way</b> logic that transcends traditional party lines...|$|R
