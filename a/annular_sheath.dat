40|$|The {{number of}} well {{integrity}} issues {{increase in the}} petroleum industry as wells are exposed to severe downhole conditions and have longer lifetimes. Techniques for enhanced oil recovery, like steam injection and field development in the Arctic, expose downhole materials to harsh cyclic temperature variations. This is also the scenario for normal production situations, although not to the same extent. Production can be stopped for various technical or non-technical reasons, or for injection purposes, all of which influence the temperature in a well. Heating and cooling make the steel casing expand and contract {{as a result of}} thermal expansion. This volumetric change can influence downhole well barriers, e. g. <b>annular</b> cement <b>sheaths</b> leading them to fail. Failure of <b>annular</b> cement <b>sheaths</b> can introduce well integrity issues and subsequent well leakages of downhole formation fluids. An experimental set-up was build during the present work to investigate the effect of thermal cycling on <b>annular</b> cement <b>sheath</b> integrity. The set-up included all the three materials in a well, casing, cement and rock allowing the whole system to be tested in one assembly at the laboratory scale. The testing specimens are composed of steel pipe cemented in place in a confining rock, thereby representing a downscaled wellbore. Temperature variations were applied radially to the casing and the effect of these variations on cement sheath integrity were observed. In-situ well integrity was continuously monitored by means of Acoustic Emission Testing (AET), and post failure analysis was conducted by Computed Tomography (CT) investigations. Three specimens were tested during the present work: The first sample was not exposed to any thermal cycles ("virgin" sample), and was directly sent to CT investigation after cement curing. The second sample was cemented with a centralized casing and the third was cemented with casing 50 % off position. Both of the latter samples were exposed to the same thermal cycle profile. The experimental results from the continuous in-situ AET measurements revealed that casing centralization is important for wellbore integrity and that thinner <b>annular</b> cement <b>sheaths</b> withstand less temperature variations. CT examination and 3 D visualization confirmed severe debonding at the casing-cement interface, for all the three specimens, including the uncycled "virgin" specimen. This indicates that the casing-cement bond is generally weak. For the cement-formation interface, the debonding was particularly clear for the two thermally cycled specimens. Furthermore, the 3 D visualization results based on CT-scans displayed that, debonding is more prominent than radial cracking. Calculations of interfacial porosity, defined as the volume of interface pores/cracks as a fraction of the total sample volume, revealed that thermal cycling and casing centralization affects the magnitude of debonding and cracking of cement. The " 50 % casing stand-off" sample showed most interfacial porosity (1. 38 %), followed by "centralized casing" sample (1. 18 %) and finally, uncycled "virgin" sample showed, least interfacial porosity (0. 59 %). This displays that thermal cycling does indeed affect the sealing ability of <b>annular</b> cement <b>sheaths</b> in a negative way. Future work is essential in order to fully understand within which temperature ranges a particular well can be operated, without leaks along the <b>annular</b> cement <b>sheaths.</b> This can be obtained by conducting tests varying the different materials. Experiments with different cement systems, various formations and casing surface finishes can be executed. In addition, experimental tests determining the effect of exposing the formation to drilling fluids prior to cementing and further thermal cycling can be conducted. Effect of various wellbore scaling ratios is also important, as the effect of the material curvatures and total volumes on the obtained results are unknown...|$|R

40|$|Trigger finger is a stenosing {{tenovaginitis}} {{in which}} there is a constriction of the <b>annular</b> <b>sheath</b> associated with a nodule in the digital flexor tendon. Clinically this can present as triggering or snapping of the nodule as it passes through the tight constricting tendon sheath. Although many triggering fingers settle spontaneously, and others respond to local anaesthestic and steroid injec-tion, others require surgical decompression. The association between diabetes and trigger finger, although not widely known, has been described and forms part of the "diabetic hand syndrome". We studied 100 adult patients in the group that required surgery. Eighteen of the 100 patients were diabetic with six insulin dependent diabetics (IDDM) and 12 non-insulin dependent diabetics (NIDDM).

Presently Z pinches are the most intense laboratory X ray sources (1. 8 MJ in 5 ns from a volume 2 mm in diameter and 2 cm tall). Powers in excess of 200 TW have been obtained. This warrants summarizes the present knowledge of physics that governs the behavior of radiating current-carrying plasma in fast Z-pinches. This survey covers essentially all aspects of the physics of fast Z pinches: initiation, instabilities of the early stage, magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the implosion phase, formation of a transient quasi-equilibrium near the stagnation point, and rebound. Considerable attention is paid to the analysis of hydrodynamic instabilities governing the implosion symmetry. Possible ways of mitigating these instabilities are discussed. Non-magnetohydrodynamic effects (anomalous resistivity, generation of particle beams, etc.) are summarized. Various applications of fast Z pinches are briefly described. Scaling laws governing development of more powerful Z pinches are presented. The survey contains 52 figures and nearly 300 references...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor the {{geological}} sequestration of atmospheric CO 2 to be viable, {{it is important}} that leakage of stored gas back to the atmosphere is prevented for a long period. Apart from other modes of failure, damage of the bond between interfaces can open up migratory pathways for leakages of CO 2 to occur. A stress induced debonding mechanism for well bore interfaces has been studied. A numerical modelling approach was used to investigate a wellbore composite cylinder system using finite element software. Analysis was performed for the wellbore <b>annular</b> cement <b>sheath,</b> both for static pressure and temperature increase/decrease. In addition, geopolymer, a novel acid resistant cementitious binder, has been considered as an annular cement system. From analysis, it has been observed that debonding can occur at discrete locations for the wellbore pressure and/temperature increase. However, for the wellbore pressure and/temperature decrease, it was found that stress-slip failure occurs when tensile normal stresses along interfaces equal the interfacial bond strength. In addition to that, for pressure and/temperature decrease, shear stresses developed in the circumferential direction appeared insignificant in debonding failure. Thermal dilation of wellbore material can help preventing discrete debonding of wellbore interfaces in the case of wellbore pressure and temperature increase. Conversely, a wellbore temperature decrease contributes to microannular formation along interface because of the material shrinkage effect...|$|R
40|$|A {{morphological}} {{study of}} the oblique ligament in the thumb is presented. The ligament was consistently described in human specimens and compared with dissections of non-human primates from different species. The oblique ligament was found in some, but not all, specimens {{in each of the}} following species examined: chimpanzee, orangutan, gibbon, anubis baboon, hamadryas baboon, squirrel monkey, lemur and marmoset. A revised identity of the oblique ligament is proposed as a reinforced distal border of a fibro-osseous <b>annular</b> pollical flexor <b>sheath</b> and whose function is not independent of the flexor sheath. The constant presence and tendinous trait of the pollical oblique ligament in humans, when compared with non-human primates, supports the notion that the oblique ligament strengthens the pollical flexor sheath in humans for restraint of the flexor pollicis longus tendon during forceful precision pinching. A derivation of the pollical oblique ligament is considered as representing a vestigial radial limb of a flexor pollicis superficialis tendon in the thumb...|$|R

40|$|The annular casing cement is an {{important}} part of the well barrier throughout the life cycle of a well. With the increasing number of plug and abandonment (P&A) operations, increased attention is now given to annular cement evaluation and the ability to prove adequate zonal isolation. If an existing annular barrier can be verified, heavy and time-consuming operations to restore the annular seal can be avoided. One of the concerns when it comes to cement integrity is the frequently occurring microannulus at the casing-cement interface. How such a microannulus forms and how it affects the integrity of the well, has been presented in this thesis. The acoustic logging tools used for cement evaluation today have also been presented. Their individual strengths and deficiencies have been discussed, and their response to a microannulus has been highlighted. A novel logging tool for cement evaluation the Annulus Verification Tool (AVT) has been developed at the Department of Geoscience and Petroleum at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The tool is meant to complement the acoustic tools used today, to improve evaluation of the cement sheath's sealing capability, especially in cases where a microannulus is detected or suspected. The AVT applies a radial force on the inner casing wall while recording the displacement of the casing. This gives a measurement of the stiffness of the casing and any surrounding material, explaining how the tool can detect the presence of an annular cement. By measuring the casing displacement with high resolution, a microannulus can be both detected and its size can be quantified. This enables an evaluation of the microannulus's effect on the integrity of the annular cement. A prototype of the AVT has been constructed and an experimental set-up has been designed to allow for initial testing of the tool. This includes construction of full-scale diameter samples representing a typical production casing cement job, with the possibility to generate a uniform microannulus of a known size at the casing-cement interface. The experimental testing performed, has shown that the AVT is able to differentiate a casing supported by an <b>annular</b> cement <b>sheath</b> from a free pipe, due to the stiffness contrast. This makes the tool able to detect the presence of an annular cement even in cases where a microannulus exists. Results also showed that a microannulus gives a characteristic logging response, and that the microannulus size can be quantified with good accuracy. Inferring the quality of the cement sheath itself proved to be challenging, as the logging response seemed to depend on other factors than solely the mechanical properties of the casing, cement, and formation. Experimental tests performed with tool eccentricity and tilting has shown that the AVT is prone to improper centralization within the casing. Numerical simulations (finite element analysis) have been performed to further increase the understanding of the AVT's logging response in specific cases. This was done using the geometry of the experimental set-up, to be able to directly compare with the experimental results and aid for an increased understanding of these. The simulated free pipe stiffness was found to match decently with the experimental results, while the simulated well-cemented stiffness was found to be significantly higher than for the experimental results. Further, the simulation results showed that a casing without annular cement support is deformed almost exclusively by ovalization, rather than compression of the steel. This confirmed the underlying principles behind determining the microannulus size from the AVT logging response. Experimental testing of the AVT should be continued, to further evaluate the uncertainty related to the microannulus size calculations. Testing on more complex casing-cement-formation samples should also be performed. The work on the numerical simulations should be continued, to resolve the discrepancy in the well-cemented stiffness. Simulations should also be used further to evaluate potential damage to the casing and cement, imposed by logging. In a longer perspective, the AVT should be made ready for downhole application. Suggested modifications (compared to the prototype) have been presented, as well as the AVT's possible role in future cement evaluation...|$|R
40|$|In the {{construction}} process {{of oil and}} gas wells, primary cementing constitutes a critical procedure of placing a cement sheath in the annulus between casing and formation, or between the casing strings. The main purpose is to provide mechanical stability to the wellbore and to ensure zonal isolation through the entire well service lifetime. Failures to achieve a proper primary cementing, and to ensure long-term sealing capabilities of the cement sheath, may severely limit the ability of a well to reach its full producing potential. Well cementing technology is a mature area, however, many operators, specifically in the North Sea, have been concerned about the ability of the cement sheath to maintain sealing integrity, given the increasing number of reported failures in mature wells. In offshore fields, these well integrity problems signify a serious concern since they imply costly repairs, limitations with respect to shortand long-term use of production and injection wells, safety and environmental issues. Therefore, recent efforts have been undertaken to achieve enhancements in the technology and standardization of logging procedures to evaluate the status of the cased-hole cement sheath barrier. Nevertheless, the verification of the cement sheath functionality still represents a technical challenge, given the uncertainty and high complexity associated with performing the task downhole. Further, it is well-know that, even in the presence of an initially good cement job, repeated temperature variations, i. e. thermal cycling, can have a detrimental impact on the integrity of the cement sheath over time. Temperature variations will cause the casing, cement and formation, to expand or contract accordingly with their distinct thermal and mechanical properties, which induce stresses that may lead to cement sheath damage. Experimental tests can be tailored for the assessment of long-term cement sheath integrity under realistic wellbore curing and operating conditions, and may establish a step forward in designing more robust and safer wells. For this reason, the main objective of this research work has been the development and application of a laboratory set-up, conceived to investigate the potential cement sheath failure mechanisms cause by time-varying thermal loads in the wellbore. A novel laboratory set-up has been designed and constructed at the Institute of Petroleum Technology Laboratory, NNTU. The focus has been to develop a testing apparatus and protocol that enables visualization of how leak paths form and propagate throughout the well annular sealant, when exposed to cyclic thermal loads and confining pressure. The set-up allowed, for the first time, studies to be performed on downscale wellbore samples constituted of casing pipe, cement and formation. The samples are intended to represent a conventional subsea well production casing section (12 1 / 4 -in borehole and a 9 5 / 8 -in casing) scaled-down by a factor of 4. Only test cases with neat class Portland G cement were assessed. However, the laboratory set-up enables the use of different types of sealants. In addition, it is presented the first use of X-ray computed tomography for the monitoring of cement sheath debonding and cracking failures over time, which provides 3 D information for identification of how, where and when the damage occurred. The experimental approach was successfully implemented, and comparative studies conducted on samples with different stand-off, surrounding formation and casing surface finish gave a new insight into the development of cement sheath failures. Numerical studies, based on the finite element method, were conducted to complement the analysis of the <b>annular</b> cement <b>sheath</b> failure mechanisms observed in the test samples throughout the various thermal cycling experiments. Furthermore, it was recognized that {{there was a lack of}} relevant knowledge on the overall impact of mechanical and thermal properties on the estimations of cement sheath stresses and mechanical failures. Consequently, as part of this research work, it was extensively studied the impact of variations in casing-cement-formation material properties, geometric parameters, casing stand-off and characteristic well-loading events, on the occurrence of cement sheath damage. The test cases were defined on the basis of a sensitivity screening of random input properties of the wellbore components, used in a conventional subsea production casing section. Based on the experimental and numerical work, an assessment of the influence of casing centralization, rock formation type and casing surface condition impact on cement sheath long-term integrity are discussed in this dissertation. The main contributions of this work are presented in four international papers contained in the Appendixes. They can be summarized as follows: • A unique experimental testing rig and procedure developed to evaluate the long-term integrity of well annular sealants towards time-varying thermal loads. The testing protocol was applied for the assessment of relevant cement sheath integrity issues. • An extensive numerical work that enabled mapping of the key variables that affect cement sheath failure mechanisms. To mitigate the risk of losing zonal isolation, guidelines for the assessment of long-term cement sheath integrity and selection of cement systems mechanical properties were given. The laboratory set-up will be used further by the sponsoring SFI DrillWell Research Centre, through SINTEF Petroleum Research as project manager, to investigate and compare the capabilities of more complex cement systems regularly used by the industry, or alternative annular sealants, to withstand time-varying loads in the wellbore...|$|R
