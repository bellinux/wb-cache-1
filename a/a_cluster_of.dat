5|$|Francium was {{discovered}} by Marguerite Perey in France (from which the element takes its name) in 1939. It was the last element first discovered in nature, rather than by synthesis. Outside the laboratory, francium is extremely rare, with trace amounts found in uranium and thorium ores, where the isotope francium-223 continually forms and decays. As little as 20–30g (one ounce) exists {{at any given time}} throughout the Earth's crust; the other isotopes (except for francium-221) are entirely synthetic.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this work}} is to define <b>a</b> <b>clustering</b> {{algorithm}} starting from the pretopological results related to the minimal closed subset concepts. However the minimal closed subsets algorithm generally does not lead us to <b>a</b> <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> the population under interest. Thus, we propose to define <b>a</b> new <b>clustering</b> method, based on this algorithm. Our method involves two steps: the first one consists in structuring the population by the minimal closed subsets method and the second one consists in building <b>a</b> <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> the population, starting from the previously obtained structuring. This method is tested on data from the ”CRAM ” of Lyon and from the emergency service of ”Hôpital Edouard Herriot ” of Lyon...|$|R
