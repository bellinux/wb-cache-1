5|$|Hypertonia – Hypertonia {{is marked}} by an {{abnormal}} increase in muscle tension and reduced ability of <b>a</b> <b>muscle</b> to stretch. Hypertonia may result from injury, disease, or conditions which involve damage to {{the central nervous system}} (e.g. cerebral palsy).|$|E
5|$|In {{rare cases}} where {{none of the}} oral {{treatments}} are effective, especially in severe neurological disease, dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite) is occasionally necessary. This treatment is injected intramuscularly (into <b>a</b> <b>muscle)</b> every few weeks and has unpleasant side effects such as pain.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam, marketed {{under the}} trade name Versed, among others, is a {{medication}} used for anesthesia, procedural sedation, trouble sleeping, and severe agitation. It works by inducing sleepiness, decreasing anxiety, and causing {{a loss of}} ability to create new memories. It is also useful {{for the treatment of}} seizures. Midazolam can be given by mouth, intravenously, by injection into <b>a</b> <b>muscle,</b> sprayed into the nose, or in the cheek. When given intravenously, it typically begins working within five minutes; when injected into <b>a</b> <b>muscle,</b> it can take fifteen minutes to begin working. Effects last for between one and six hours.|$|E
50|$|In {{isotonic}} contraction, {{the tension}} in the muscle remains constant despite <b>a</b> change in <b>muscle</b> length. This occurs when <b>a</b> <b>muscle's</b> force of contraction matches the total load on the muscle.|$|R
5000|$|Adolf Fick {{originally}} {{discovered in}} 1882 that [...] "contracting muscle under stretch could produce greater force than <b>a</b> shortening <b>muscle</b> contraction" [...] like in concentric movements. Fifty years later, A.V. Hill determined that [...] "the body had lower energy demand during <b>an</b> eccentric <b>muscle</b> contraction than during <b>a</b> concentric <b>muscle</b> action".|$|R

5|$|The {{principle}} {{behind the}} battery is the injury potential created in <b>a</b> <b>muscle</b> {{when it is}} damaged, although this was not fully understood in the 18th and 19th centuries; the potential being caused incidentally due to the dissection of the frog's muscles.|$|E
5|$|A raw 3D {{model of}} Jacob's wolf {{was the basis}} for {{creating}} the others. <b>A</b> <b>muscle</b> system, which gave the appearance of muscles firing and flexing, contributed to this model. From there, the initial fur layout went to painters who were responsible for its color and groom. They also added characteristics, such as wet hair clumping together, and applied it to the fur. They refined this look before passing it off to the lighting and technical directors.|$|E
5|$|Flexing {{the toes}} and feet and {{extending}} on tiptoes, {{can all be}} very useful in detecting perforator vein incompetence. These movements unleash <b>a</b> <b>muscle</b> contraction which compresses deep veins. If a perforator valve is incompetent then a reflux from the deep to the superficial through the perforator vein will be registered.|$|E
50|$|The ground {{reaction}} force creates external moments on the joints of the lower-limb. Activation of muscles and other passive connective tissues (e.g., ligaments, tendons) create {{what is known}} as internal moments that control joint motions. When a joint motion occurs in the direction of <b>a</b> <b>muscle’s</b> action it is concentrically acting. If a joint motion occurs in the opposite direction of <b>a</b> <b>muscle’s</b> action then the muscle is eccentrically acting. Therefore, the magnitude of the internal moment reasonably matches the described muscular activations.|$|R
50|$|Surgery is <b>a</b> {{solution}} to <b>muscle</b> shortening but other complications may arise. Following muscle lengthening surgery, force production and ROM is usually reduced {{due to the}} shift in sarcomere locations between <b>a</b> <b>muscle's</b> maximal and minimal length. Shortening of the surgically lengthened muscle can re-occur.|$|R
5000|$|There is an {{important}} difference between <b>a</b> helping synergist <b>muscle</b> and <b>a</b> true synergist <b>muscle.</b> <b>A</b> true synergist <b>muscle</b> is one that only neutralizes an undesired joint action, whereas a helping synergist is one that neutralizes an undesired action but also assists with the desired action.|$|R

5|$|Muscle {{cells have}} another {{specialized}} function of smooth ER. The ER membrane pumps calcium ions from the cytosol into the cisternal space. When <b>a</b> <b>muscle</b> cell becomes stimulated by a nerve impulse, calcium goes {{back across the}} ER membrane into the cytosol and generates the contraction of the muscle cell.|$|E

5|$|Scientific {{interpretations of}} the crest's {{function}} began in 1910, when George Francis Eaton proposed two possibilities: an aerodynamic counterbalance and <b>a</b> <b>muscle</b> attachment point. He suggested that the crest might have anchored large, long jaw muscles, but admitted that this function alone could not explain the large size of some crests. Bennett (1992) agreed with Eaton's own assessment that the crest was too large and variable to have been <b>a</b> <b>muscle</b> attachment site. Eaton had suggested that a secondary function of the crest might have been as a counterbalance against the long beak, reducing the need for heavy neck muscles to control {{the orientation of the}} head. Wind tunnel tests showed that the crest did function as an effective counterbalance to a degree, but Bennett noted that again, the hypothesis focuses only on the long crests of male P. longiceps, not on the larger crests of P. sternbergi and very small crests that existed among the females. Bennett found that the crests of females had no counterbalancing effect, and that the crests of male P. sternbergi would, by themselves, {{have a negative effect on}} the balance of the head. In fact, side to side movement of the crests would have required more, not less, neck musculature to control balance.|$|E
5|$|The {{proboscis}} is an infolding of {{the body}} wall, and sits in the rhynchocoel when inactive. When muscles in {{the wall of the}} rhynchocoel compress the fluid in the rhynchocoel, the pressure makes the proboscis jump inside-out to attack the animal's prey along a canal called the rhynchodeum and through an orifice, the proboscis pore. The proboscis has <b>a</b> <b>muscle</b> which attaches {{to the back of the}} rhynchocoel, and which can stretch up to 30 times its inactive length and then retract the proboscis.|$|E
5|$|The risk {{of sexual}} {{transmission}} of syphilis {{can be reduced}} by using a latex condom. Syphilis can be effectively treated with antibiotics. The preferred antibiotic for most cases is benzathine penicillin G injected into <b>a</b> <b>muscle.</b> In {{those who have a}} severe penicillin allergy, doxycycline or tetracycline may be used. In those with neurosyphilis, intravenous penicillin G potassium or ceftriaxone is recommended. During treatment people may develop fever, headache, and muscle pains, a reaction known as Jarisch-Herxheimer.|$|E

5000|$|In vitro muscle testing {{can be done}} on any {{scale of}} muscle {{organization}} - entire groups of muscles (provided they share a common insertion or origin, as in the human quadriceps), <b>a</b> single <b>muscle,</b> <b>a</b> [...] "bundle" [...] of <b>muscle</b> fibers, <b>a</b> single <b>muscle</b> fiber, <b>a</b> single myofibril, a single sarcomere, or even <b>a</b> half-sarcomere. <b>Muscle</b> fibers may be intact, or may be [...] "skinned", a process which removes the cell membrane, sarcoplasmic reticulum, and cytoplasm, allowing greater access to the contractile components of the sarcomere.|$|R

The film's version of Juggernaut is depicted as a mutant and his relation to Charles Xavier was never mentioned. Matthew Vaughn cast Jones, who he met producing the Guy Ritchie gangster movies where Jones begun his acting career. The actor {{had to go through}} a four-hour make-up process to portray Juggernaut, which included <b>a</b> <b>muscle</b> suit and a prostethic chin. The costume tried to retain the bullet-shaped helmet of the comics without going excessively over the top.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as <b>a</b> <b>muscle</b> stimulant, and higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E

40|$|Locomotor muscles often perform diverse roles, {{functioning}} as motors that produce mechanical energy, struts that produce force and brakes that dissipate mechanical energy. In many vertebrate muscles, these functions {{are not mutually}} exclusive and <b>a</b> single <b>muscle</b> often performs <b>a</b> range of mechanically diverse tasks. This functional diversity has obscured the relationship between <b>a</b> <b>muscle's</b> locomotor function and its mechanical properties. I use hopping in toads as a model system for comparing muscles that primarily produce mechanical energy with muscles that primarily dissipate mechanical energy. During hopping, hindlimb muscles undergo active shortening to produce mechanical energy and propel the animal into the air, whereas the forelimb muscles undergo active lengthening to dissipate mechanical energy during landing. Muscles performing distinct mechanical functions operate on different regions of the force-length curve. These findings suggest that <b>a</b> <b>muscle's</b> operating length may be shaped by potential trade-offs between force production and sarcomere stability. In addition, the passive force-length properties of hindlimb and forelimb muscles vary, suggesting that passive stiffness functions to restrict the muscle's operating length in vivo. These results inform our understanding of vertebrate muscle variation by providing a clear link between <b>a</b> <b>muscle's</b> locomotor function and its mechanical properties. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

5|$|Despite his misgivings Berdyev kept Kinkladze in the team, {{where he}} was used as one of three {{offensive}} midfielders in a 4–2–3–1 formation. Kinkladze, with his technical style and inclination for improvisation, brought more variety to the attacking play of the team, {{in contrast to the}} restrained style of play that Berdyev favoured. He provided an assist in four consecutive matches. The most important of these was against Zenit St. Petersburg, in a match that decided a place in the following year's UEFA Cup. Subsequently, he received a recall to the Georgian national squad for friendlies against Bulgaria and Jordan. However, <b>a</b> <b>muscle</b> strain meant he missed both national team games and Rubin's final league match. He ended the 2005 season with seven assists and two goals in nine appearances for Rubin.|$|E

However, Tardelli was sacked as Egypt coach and in January 2005 the Egyptian Football Association said they would consider bringing Mido back into the team if he were to apologise for his past behaviour. Mido flew to Cairo in February 2005 and made a public apology and the following month he was recalled by the national team. Mido withdrew from Egypt's 2006 World Cup qualifier against Cameroon, after sustaining <b>a</b> <b>muscle</b> tear while playing with Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E

However, after being assessed by Canucks team doctors, his broken toe was judged to {{have not yet fully}} healed and he was not cleared for AHL assignment. Hodgson additionally believed that he had re-injured his back while colliding head-first into the boards during Game 7 of the opening playoff round. He underwent an MRI in the off-season, which uncovered the misdiagnosed bulging disc to be <b>a</b> <b>muscle</b> strain instead. With the Canucks' consent, he trained in the off-season with former NHL player Gary Roberts, who had himself overcome a back injury during his career.|$|E

40|$|This article {{reports the}} {{pneumatic}} artificial muscles based on biomechanical characteristics of human <b>muscles.</b> <b>A</b> wearable device and a rehabilitation robot that assist <b>a</b> human <b>muscle</b> should have characteristics {{similar to those}} of human muscle.
