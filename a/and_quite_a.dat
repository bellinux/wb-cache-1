She noted that Cole's various outfits appear to distract people from the lyrics of the song which [...] "seem to be, a thinly veiled reflection on her own marriage compounded by the sad mooning face she keeps pulling. [...] singing a solo song about one's troubled (though reconciled and apparently happy) marriage. Although sometimes she looks cross instead. <b>And</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> lot of the time, she looks like she's her own evil sexy twin." ...|$|E

500|$|Rockefeller had a {{long and}} {{controversial}} career {{in the oil industry}} followed by a long career in philanthropy. His image is an amalgam of all of these experiences and the many ways he was viewed by his contemporaries.

Powell said that [...] "It's quite interesting to have two people's viewpoints within the same song. I'm not sure how many bands actually do that. In most bands, the guitarist writes the music and the singer writes the lyrics. We tend to share things out more evenly." [...] He also criticised the attachment of an indie pop label to the band, saying [...] "We're seen as one of the indie bands. But we've always just tried to make pop music. Even if it is pop music with a hard edge <b>and</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> twisted little view of life. We've always seen ourselves as a little bigger than an indie band." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2006, Robert [...] "Evel" [...] Knievel sued West for {{trademark}} infringement in West's video for [...] "Touch the Sky". Knievel {{took issue with}} a [...] "sexually charged video" [...] in which West takes on the persona of [...] "Evel Kanyevel" [...] and attempts flying a rocket over a canyon. The suit claimed infringement on Knievel's trademarked name and likeness. Knievel also claimed that the [...] "vulgar and offensive" [...] images depicted in the video damaged his reputation. The suit sought monetary damages and an injunction to stop distribution of the video. West's attorneys argued that the music video amounted to satire and therefore was covered under the First Amendment. Just days {{before his death in}} November 2007, Knievel amicably settled the suit after being paid a visit from West, saying, [...] "I thought he was a wonderful guy <b>and</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> gentleman." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{the average}} soldier, {{life at the}} fort was [...] "monotonous". [...] Until the {{permanent}} structures were built, soldiers had to live in tents, which lacked comfort. [...] Aside from a few whiskey peddlers and prostitutes, few civilians lived at the fort. [...] Officers had brought their personal slaves with them, including Captain Swords. [...] The border with Missouri was [...] east of Fort Scott. In Missouri was a grog shop that supplied soldiers, <b>and</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> few courts-martial followed soldiers' going AWOL at the shop. [...] The desertion rate from the fort ranged from 12%-16%, due to boredom, irregular pay, and hatred for military life. [...] As no combat took place near the fort, it seemed more of a frontier village than a military base. [...] Hunting was a popular pastime; according to Captain Swords, [...] "wolf chasing and duck hunting" [...] {{was the only way}} one officer could tolerate the place.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "The Telltale Head" [...] finished twenty-sixth in {{ratings for the}} week of February 19–25, 1990, with a Nielsen rating of 15.2, equivalent to approximately 14.0 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Married... with Children. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood said they enjoyed: [...] "the Simpsons [...] grossly dysfunctional in church, Homer dispensing terrible advice, and a real moral dilemma for Bart." [...] In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 3/5 and added, [...] "This is a strange episode, touching on many bizarre aspects of the show to come." [...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said, [...] "Good little moments abounded, {{and this was a}} generally solid episode. I liked the objects the boys saw in the clouds, <b>and</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> few other funny bits appeared. “Telltale” wasn’t a great episode, but it was generally entertaining and clever." ...|$|E

With all this, however, Mr. Pound, like so many others who have striven for advancement of intelligence and culture in England, has made more enemies than friends... Much of the Press has been deliberately closed by cabal to him; his books have for some time been ignored or written down; and he himself has been compelled to live on much less than would support a navvy. His fate, as I have said, is not unusual... Taken by and large, England hates men of culture until they are dead.|$|E
