5|$|The defense case {{commenced}} on March 25. The third {{count of}} the indictment was quashed as duplicative with the first.

A staunch abolitionist, Hayes found his {{work on behalf of}} fugitive slaves personally gratifying as well as politically useful, as it raised his profile in the newly formed Republican Party.|$|E
