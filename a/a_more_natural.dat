5|$|Around 1925, {{having had}} little success in Batavia, Andjar moved to Padang, {{where he was}} a {{reporter}} for the daily Sinar Soematera. At the same time, he worked with the city's Padangsche Opera, writing stage plays. In contrast to the standard musical theatre of the time, bangsawan, he promoted <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> style, using dialogue instead of song to convey the story; he referred to this as toneel, based on the Dutch word for theatre. Among the works he wrote for the Padangsche Opera were adaptations of Melati van Agam, a 1923 work by Swan Pen, and Sitti Nurbaya, a 1922 novel by Marah Roesli. These works were well received.|$|E
5|$|Colder weather, {{bringing}} with it rain and snow on September 11 calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though the fires continued to burn {{well into the}} middle of November, they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by the firefighting efforts. Hundreds of miles of firelines, helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> state, and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings. Finally, on November 18, all fires in Yellowstone were officially declared out.|$|E

5|$|In the off-season, Näslund {{was drafted}} 16th {{overall in the}} 1991 NHL Entry Draft by the Pittsburgh Penguins. The team's general manager, Craig Patrick, hailed Näslund and Forsberg as the draft's top two {{prospects}} behind first-overall selection Eric Lindros. He compared Näslund to the Los Angeles Kings' Swedish forward Tomas Sandström, {{although he did not}} consider him as aggressive a player, and further claimed that he was <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> goal-scorer than Penguins forward Jaromír Jágr, who had just completed his rookie year with the club.|$|E
5|$|Recorded in Los Angeles with {{producer}} David Schiffman, {{the album}} was initially released on October 20, 2009, by Indica Records in Canada. By design, the album lacks the production values of the band's debut album, Hello Master, {{in order to achieve}} <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> sound. As the band took more progressive rock influences and applied them to their songwriting, they changed their lyrical focus and wrote about themes considered to be more unusual for rock music, such as film and television characters, for this album.|$|E
5|$|The park's Wildlife Conservation Education Centre has {{lectures and}} video shows about {{wildlife}} and guided {{tours of the}} park and animal orphanage. These tours are primarily, but not exclusively, to educate schools and local communities. There has been criticism about animals' housing, and they now have more spacious housing in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> environment. The Kenya Wildlife Service has created a Safari Walk that highlights the variety of plants and animals that are in Kenya, and how they affect Kenya's population.|$|E

5|$|The single known {{example of}} Argentodites is a blade-like fourth lower premolar (p4). It has {{a length of}} 4.15mm, height of 2.10mm, and width of 1.35mm. The crown is nearly complete, but the roots are largely missing. Kielan-Jaworowska {{considered}} two possible orientations of the tooth—one with the back margin nearly vertically, {{and the other with}} the margin inclined backwards—but preferred the former, which made for <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> placement of the roots. Although the left and right sides of the tooth are almost identical, they believed the tooth is most likely a left p4, as this would make the lingual (inner) side the more convex one, as is usual in the p4 of cimolodontan multituberculates with a large p4.|$|E
5|$|Halos {{characters}} were continually refined through development, {{as the company}} was bought by Microsoft and the platform shifted from the Macintosh to the Xbox. Other Bungie developers would often add input to the progress of characters in Halo, {{even if they were}} not working on the game itself. For example, an outside artist, Shi Kai Wang, developed the early concept sketches of what would eventually become the Master Chief. However upon developing a 3D model, the artists decided the Chief looked too slender, almost effeminate, and subsequently bulked up the character. Early Covenant Elites had <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> jaw rather than the split mandibles they would later sport; at one point, Jason Jones was also insistent about having a tail on the Elites, but this idea was eventually dropped.|$|E
5|$|However, Shakespeare {{soon began}} to adapt the {{traditional}} styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III {{has its roots in}} the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays. No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles. By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.|$|E

5|$|The {{walkie-talkie}} {{interaction in}} Firewatch {{is inspired by}} the relationship in BioShock between the player character and Atlas, {{as well as the}} dialog system from The Walking Dead. At one point in the development, it was intended that the protagonist would be able to communicate with multiple characters, such as hikers, but the idea was discarded due to its expense and the schedule requirements with which the team were working. The team hoped to avoid lip syncing and minimize the amount of animation needed due to the limited team size and resources. The developers cast Cissy Jones, who appeared in The Walking Dead, as the voice of Delilah in 2014. It took longer to find a voice actor for Henry who the developers felt jibed with Jones; they ultimately cast Rich Sommer. Jones and Sommer recorded their lines in separate studios, but while on conference calls with each other to achieve <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> rapport. The actors made a decision not to meet during production to maintain the distance between their characters.|$|E
5|$|Tomb Raider: Underworld {{continued}} the plot line established in Legend. Crystal Dynamics used {{new technology to}} improve the character for seventh generation consoles, focusing on improving realism. The dirt accumulation and water cleansing mechanic from Legend was altered to be a real-time mechanic that can involve the entire game environment. To achieve <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>natural</b> appearance, the developers added spherical harmonics to provide indirect lighting to in-game objects like Lara Croft. Crystal Dynamics made the character model more complex and detailed than previous instalments, featuring more texture layers that determine the appearance of shadows and reflective light on it, and using skeletal animation to portray believable movement. The number of polygons in the model increased to 32,000. The developers enhanced Croft's facial model by {{increasing the number of}} polygons, bones used in the animation skeleton, and graphical shaders in the face to add more detail and expressive capabilities. The hair was created as a real-time cloth simulation to further add realism to its shape and movement. The developers kept Croft's hair tied back because they felt a real person would not want it flying around while performing dangerous manoeuvres. The character's body size was increased and breast size reduced to portray more realistic proportions.|$|E
