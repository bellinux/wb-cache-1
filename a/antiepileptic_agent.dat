50|$|One of many {{recovery}} {{methods are}} 12-step recovery programs, with prominent examples including Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Drug Addicts Anonymous and Pills Anonymous. They are commonly known {{and used for}} a variety of addictions for the individual addicted and the family of the individual. Substance-abuse rehabilitation (rehab) centers offer a residential treatment program for some of the more seriously addicted, in order to isolate the patient from drugs and interactions with other users and dealers. Outpatient clinics usually offer a combination of individual counseling and group counseling. Frequently, a physician or psychiatrist will prescribe medications in order to help patients cope with the side effects of their addiction. Medications can help immensely with anxiety and insomnia, can treat underlying mental disorders (cf. self-medication hypothesis, Khantzian 1997) such as depression, and can help reduce or eliminate withdrawal symptomology when withdrawing from physiologically addictive drugs. Some examples are using benzodiazepines for alcohol detoxification, which prevents delirium tremens and complications; using a slow taper of benzodiazepines or a taper of phenobarbital, sometimes including another <b>antiepileptic</b> <b>agent</b> such as gabapentin, pregabalin, or valproate, for withdrawal from barbiturates or benzodiazepines; using drugs such as baclofen to reduce cravings and propensity for relapse amongst addicts to any drug, especially effective in stimulant users, and alcoholics (in which it is nearly as effective as benzodiazepines in preventing complications); using clonidine, an alpha-agonist, and loperamide for opioid detoxification, for first-time users or those who wish to attempt an abstinence-based recovery (90% of opioid users relapse to active addiction within eight months or are multiple relapse patients); or replacing an opioid that is interfering with or destructive to a user's life, such as illicitly-obtained heroin, dilaudid, or oxycodone, with an opioid that can be administered legally, reduces or eliminates drug cravings, and does not produce a high, such as methadone or buprenorphine - opioid replacement therapy - which is the gold standard for treatment of opioid dependence in developed countries, reducing the risk and cost to both user and society more effectively than any other treatment modality (for opioid dependence), and shows the best short-term and long-term gains for the user, with the greatest longevity, least risk of fatality, greatest quality of life, and lowest risk of relapse and legal issues including arrest and incarceration.|$|E

40|$|Epilepsy is {{a serious}} and common {{neurological}} disorder for which effective and well tolerated new agents continue to be sought. While the assessment of potential antiepileptic agents in animals models of epilepsy poses few problems, such assessment in humans is fraught with methodological and ethical dilemmas. Before the introduction of controlled clinical trials, agents that were though to have antiepileptic potential were merely administered to patients with epilepsy and the effects observed. Nowadays, many controls are placed on the testing of all new pharmacological agents, including antiepileptic drugs. The simplest method of assessing the efficacy of a new <b>antiepileptic</b> <b>agent</b> in humans is in a monotherapy, placebo-controlled trial. However, such a trial design poses serious ethical and moral issues due {{to the importance of}} achieving early optimal control of epileptic seizures in patients. Because of these difficulties, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials are rarely performed. Instead, add-on and crossover designs are used, each of which has its own inherent disadvantages. Thus, the ideal trial design which allows accurate and simple assessment of the efficacy of a new <b>antiepileptic</b> <b>agent</b> has still to be developed...|$|E

40|$|Activation of {{chloride}} gated GABAA receptors {{regulates the}} excitatory transmission in the epileptic brain. Positive allosteric modulation of these receptors via distinct recognition sites is the therapeutic mechanism of <b>antiepileptic</b> <b>agents</b> which prevents the hyperexcitability associated with epilepsy. These distinct sites {{are based on}} subunit composition which determines binding of various drugs like benzodiazepines, barbiturates, steroids and anesthetics. The binding of <b>antiepileptic</b> <b>agents</b> to this recognition site increases the affinity of GABAA receptor for modulating the inhibitory effects of GABAinduced chloride ion flux. In the pentameric complex structure of these receptors, the α/β interface locates the binding site of agonists and the α/γ interface forms the benzodiazepine (BZD) binding site on extracellular domain. Thus the γ subunit is shown as highly required for functional modulation of the receptor channels by benzodiazepines. The present study initiates the binding analysis of chosen benzodiazepines with the modeled GABA receptor subunit gamma- 2.

40|$|Background: Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of morbidity, {{mortality}} and needs long-term treatment. There is a wide range of variation in the prices of drugs marketed in India. Thus, a study was planned to analyse out cost variations of antiepileptic drugs available in Indian market. Methods: Minimum and maximum costs in rupees (INR) of antiepileptic agents manufactured by different companies, in the same strength and dosage forms were obtained from and ldquo;current index of medical specialties and rdquo; January and # 8209; April 2016. The cost ratio and percentage cost variation were calculated for each generic <b>antiepileptic</b> <b>agent.</b> Results: There is a wide variation in the prices of different brands of same <b>antiepileptic</b> <b>agent</b> in Indian market. The highest cost ratio and percent cost variation was found for divalproex 500 mg [(1 : 3. 17) and 216. 7], followed by lamotrigine 25 mg [(1 : 2. 5) and 150], clobazam 10 mg [(1 : 2. 47) and 147. 3] and clonazepam 0. 5 mg [(1 : 2. 46) and 145. 9]. Conclusions: The average percentage price variation of different brands of the same oral antiepileptic drugs in Indian market is very wide. Treatment of epilepsy has a long course with compliance being a key factor for successful treatment. Improved adherence to the treatment can be ensured by decreasing the cost of therapy, by changes in the government policies and regulations and creating awareness among treating physicians for switching to cost effective therapy.

40|$|Bipolar {{disorder}} (BD) is {{a long-term}} illness with mood swings which are characterized by recurrent episodes of mania/hypomania and depression, with variable interpolations of relatively asymptomatic periods, called euthymic, in which, however, some psychopathological symptoms may persist. Although mood stabilizers, such as lithium, are the first-line treatment {{for the prevention of}} new BD episodes, combination therapy has become the standard of care for BD patients. Besides lithium, the use of a mood stabilizer along with an atypical antipsychotic is recommended in many patients. Recently, atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone and aripiprazole) and <b>antiepileptic</b> <b>agents</b> (valproate, lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine) are increasingly used as mood stabilizers. To reduce side effects and optimize treatment it is important to perform accurate monitoring of drug blood levels in these patients, who are often treated with multiple drugs. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is in fact a powerful tool that, starting from clinical-chemical correlation data, allows to tailor-cut treatment to the specific needs of individual patients; hence the need to have reliable analytical methods available for the determination of plasma levels of drugs and their metabolites. Analyses of biological samples are mainly carried out using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with different detectors, capillary electrophoresis and gas-chromatography. Various procedures are employed to remove biological interferences before analyzing the samples.
