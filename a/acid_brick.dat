40|$|The {{disposal}} of industrial wastes comprises {{one of the}} major worldwide environmental problems as these wastes render the environment unfriendly. The growing demand for waste utilization has made solid wastes like materials from granite processing industry, and blast furnace slag to be absorbed into the ceramic composition of bricks. The possibility of reduction of the production costs provides a strong logic for use of this waste. Blast furnace slag is a non-metallic by-product from ironand steel industry which is generated during the conversion ofiron ore or scarp iron to steel, along with coke for fuel. Presence of hazardous elements such as Pb, Cd, Ni and Cr are common in some steel slags which make the slag environmentally harmful. In this work, attempt has been made to develop <b>Acid</b> Resistant <b>Bricks</b> from waste materials i. e. granite saw dust derived during cutting and grinding of granite blocks and blast furnace slag along with clay. The different body formulations have been made in order to study the effect of these three raw materials on the fired properties of the <b>acid</b> resistant <b>bricks.</b> The body made with the variation of raw materials have been fired at three different temperatures and their behaviours with respect to Apparent Porosity, Water Absorption, Bulk Density and Firing Volume Changes as a function of both temperature and granite:slag ratio was studied. It has been observed that the vitrification of the body increased with the increase in granite content. This increase is attributed to the increase in Feldpar content which accompanies the increase of granite...|$|R

Ferrosilicons with silicon content up to about 15% are made in blast furnaces lined with <b>acid</b> fire <b>bricks.</b> Ferrosilicons with higher silicon content are made in electric arc furnaces. The usual formulations on the market are ferrosilicons with 15%, 45%, 75%, and 90% silicon. The remainder is iron, with about 2% consisting of other elements like aluminium and calcium. An overabundance of silica is used to prevent formation of silicon carbide.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} design {{optimization}} of brick-lined autoclaves to reduce wall thickness without compromising autoclave integrity. The use of <b>acid</b> resistant, <b>brick</b> lined, horizontal, autoclaves {{is common for}} hydrometallurgical processing within the mining industry. To prevent corrosion of the carbon steel pressure boundary, autoclaves are often lined with an acid proof flexible membrane and high nickel alloy overlay localized at nozzle areas. A brick lining protects the membrane against high temperature and abrasive damage {{that would result in}} corrosion of the carbon steel pressure boundary. Because of stringent out-of-roundness and deflection requirements, autoclave designers are faced with the challenge of choosing the proper thickness and layout of the autoclaves. Common practice for satisfying stringent requirements is to design much thicker autoclave than what is required to satisfy pressure and temperature conditions. This paper provides a methodology for the design that utilizes stiffening rings for controlling out-of-roundness that results in thinner and lighter autoclaves...|$|R
40|$|A 200 ft. tall stack, {{consisting}} of a concrete chimney with an independent <b>acid</b> proof <b>brick</b> liner built in the 1950 `s, serving the Separations facility at the Savannah River Site (SRS), was evaluated for the performance category 3 (PC 3) level of Natural Phenomena Hazards (NPH) effects. The inelastic energy absorption capacity of the concrete chimney was considered {{in the evaluation of}} the earthquake resistance, in particular, to compute the F{sub {mu}} factor. The calculated value of F{sub {mu}} exceeded 3. 0, while the seismic demand for the PC 3 level, using an F{sub {mu}} value of 1. 5, was found to be less than the capacity of the concrete chimney. The capacity formulation of ACI 307 was modified to incorporate the effect of an after design opening on the tension side. There are considerable uncertainties in determining the earthquake resistance of the independent brick liner. The critical liner section, located {{at the bottom of the}} breeching opening, does not meet the current recommendations. A discussion is provided for the possible acceptable values for the ``Moment Reduction Factor``, R{sub w} or F{sub {mu}} for the liner.

40|$|The Impala Platinum Limited Base Metals Refinery in Springs, South Africa, refines {{convertor}} matte containing {{base metals}} and PGM 2 ̆ 7 s (platinum group metals) using a hydrometallurgical process. In {{addition to a}} PGM-rich concentrate that is further refined, the Base Metals Refinery produces nickel (in powder or briquette form), copper cathodes and cobalt powder. Five leaching stages are utilized to remove the base metals and impurities from the PGM concentrate. The project described in this paper involves a radical redesign of the second stage leach autoclave {{with the aim of}} reducing maintenance costs and downtime, increasing throughput and ensuring a safer working environment. The second stage leach process at the Base Metals Refinery, produces a PGM-rich residue through the extraction of copper and any remaining base metals from the first stage leach solid residue material. Leaching is performed in an autoclave operating at a pressure of 600 kPaG and a temperature of 140 °C to 150 °C. Concentrated H 2 SO 4 is added to the feed to produce a solution with a free acid content between 10 and 30 g/L and a pH of less than 2. Oxygen is passed into the 1 st and 2 nd compartments of the autoclave. As a result of the aggressive, highly oxidizing conditions within the autoclave, the original design utilized a heavy wall carbon steel shell with lead lining and two layers of <b>acid</b> <b>bricks.</b> The bricks acted as a wear resistant material and ensured a low surface temperature at the skin of the lead lining, whereas the lead lining acted as a corrosion barrier to protect the steel shell. These brick lined autoclaves were heavy, maintenance intensive and prone to catastrophic failure. A radical autoclave redesign was needed to reduce the high costs of manufacturing, installation and operation. Finite element modelling was used to optimize the design and various high alloy materials were investigated for the application. Based on extensive test work, the carbon steel shell was replaced with duplex SAF 2205 stainless steel in the new design. The use of this highly corrosion resistant material, eliminates the need for the lead and brick linings and reduces the wall thickness requirements substantially, resulting in an increase in the available volume for the same external shell dimensions. The vessel is welded in circular sections to form an elongated, impermeable, cylindrical body, with several agitator nozzles and compartments. The first new duplex stainless steel unit has been in continuous operation for more than 24 months and its performance has exceeded the highest expectations. The design was so successful that a patent has been registered. The major benefits of the new stainless steel design include increased throughput, improved performance, less downtime and a safer working environment. Lead has been eliminated and replaced with a more environmentally safe material, and the total lifespan of the vessel has been extended. In addition, the autoclave project has made significant developments in advancing the field of welding and optimizing the integrity of welding quality standards in South Africa...|$|R
