Many wounded Home Army soldiers became stranded during the uprising and were simply not able to evacuate in time. For others, the choice to remain resulted from feelings of despair and hopelessness brought {{by the fall of}} the uprising; at least initially, they simply did not have the motivation to leave.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{formally}} {{described and}} named the species in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. He {{did not identify}} a type specimen, but the one specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species. He <b>also</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> explicitly give an etymology for the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives from the Latin verticillatus ("whorled"), {{in reference to the}} whorled leaf arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Fighter pilots {{received}} no instrument training until very {{late in the}} war, after the training course had already been curtailed because of fuel shortages {{and the need to}} produce pilots more quickly to replace losses. Galland <b>also</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> make sure all-weather flying was incorporated into pilot training, which was of decisive importance in an effective air defence force.|$|E

5|$|In 1941, the New York City Planning Department {{proposed}} the Gun Hill Crosstown Highway as an upgrade, {{but nothing happened}} with this plan. In the mid-1960s, the Tri-State Transportation Commission proposed a new route just a mile north of Gun Hill Road called the City Line Expressway; this plan <b>also</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> advance.|$|E
5|$|In December 1973, state {{subsidies}} for towns outside the MBTA funding district were halved, {{resulting in the}} MBTA needing to renegotiate subsidies from 14 municipalities. Ultimately Ayer, with just 14 daily commuters, refused to pay its $8200 bill in 1974; Littleton <b>also</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> reach an agreement. On March 1, 1975, the line was cut back to South Acton, dropping stops at Ayer, Littleton, and West Acton.|$|E
5|$|Knittel {{made many}} errors, {{especially}} in Latin text, he <b>also</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> decipher every word and left several lacunae in the reconstructed text (e.g. Romans 11:35; 12:2; 15:8). Tischendorf {{made a new}} and more accurate collation for the Latin text and edited in 1855. Tischendorf used abbreviations for the nomina sacra, he did not leave any lacunae.|$|E

5|$|Monotype created Bembo {{during a}} period of renewed {{interest}} in the printing of the Italian Renaissance, under the influence of Monotype executive and printing historian Stanley Morison. It followed a previous more faithful revival of Manutius's work, Poliphilus, whose reputation it largely eclipsed. Monotype also created a second, much more eccentric italic for it to the design of calligrapher Alfred Fairbank, which <b>also</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> receive the same attention as the normal version of Bembo.|$|E

5|$|Opinion has varied on the {{validity}} of a separate genus for Nedoceratops. John Scannella and Jack Horner regarded it as an intermediate growth stage between Triceratops and Torosaurus. Andrew Farke, in his 2011 redescription of the only known skull, concluded {{that it was an}} aged individual of its own valid taxon, Nedoceratops hatcheri. Nicholas Longrich and Daniel Fields <b>also</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> consider it a transition between Torosaurus and Triceratops, suggesting that the frill holes were pathological.|$|E

5|$|Parker and Stone {{were very}} happy with the episode, but {{received}} feedback from fans {{that it was one of}} the weaker episodes of the first season, and that the constant jokes about Barbra Streisand started to grow redundant. Many fans <b>also</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> like Kenny's tether ball accident death scene because it had nothing to do with the plot of the episode, which Parker and Stone said was supposed to be the joke.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese used chariots for horse-based warfare {{until light}} cavalry forces became common during the Warring States era (402221 BC). A major {{proponent of the}} change to riding horses from chariots was Wu Ling, c.320 BC. However, {{conservative}} forces in China often opposed change, and cavalry never became as dominant as in Europe. Cavalry in China <b>also</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> benefit from the additional cachet attached to being the military branch dominated by the nobility.|$|E
5|$|The North Carolinas <b>also</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have {{sufficient}} space {{to act as}} fleet flagships, so the lead ship of the new class was designed with an extra deck on the conning tower specifically for this purpose, although the increase in space and weight from this necessitated removal of two twin 5-in DP mounts.|$|E

5|$|Also, then 32 year-old San Luis Obispo-born swimmer Virginia Farmer {{represented}} American Samoa at the Beijing Olympics. Farmer was {{the only}} American Samoan in her event. Additionally, prior to Beijing, she had not participated in any Olympic games or event. The preliminary round for the event took place on August 15, and Virginia Farmer participated in the fourth heat. She finished the race in 28.82seconds, ranking third behind Swaziland's Senele Dlamini (28.70seconds) and ahead of Bolivia's Katerine Moreno (29.05seconds). The leader of Virginia's heat was Mozambique's Ximene Gomes (28.15seconds). Out of the 92 participating athletes, Farmer ranked 62nd.

5|$|Although O'Malley was {{loyal to}} his {{employees}}, {{he did not}} take kindly to demands from employees such as manager Charlie Dressen's request for a three-year contract. When Dressen requested a multi-year contract after losing a second consecutive World Series to the Yankees, he was released. Then when he hired Walter Alston as a replacement, he made it clear to the press that Alston would only receive one-year contracts and would not attempt to show up the management in the national media. There were rumors that Alston even signed blank contracts in the fall and showed up in the spring to find out his salary. O'Malley <b>also</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> support those who remained friends with Rickey, which was a large factor in Red Barber quitting as Dodgers announcer.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1988, Surfer Rosa {{was named}} one of the year's best albums on English critics' year-end lists. Independent music {{magazines}} Melody Maker and Sounds named Surfer Rosa as their album of the year; NME and Record Mirror placed the album 10th and 14th, respectively. However, Surfer Rosa failed to appear on The Village Voices Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics. It <b>also</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> appear on any end-of-year list in the United States. A number of music magazines have since positioned Surfer Rosa as one of the quintessential alternative rock records of the 1980s. The album has appeared on several all-time best album lists, and is consistently placed {{as one of the best}} albums of the 1980s in any genre.|$|E
5|$|Baird's first {{press conference}} as a cabinet {{minister}} {{was held in}} July 1999, and was intended to highlight the Harris government's record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls. Baird told reporters that 15,000 people had left the system since the introduction of workfare, and used this figure {{to argue that the}} government's policy was a success. At the time, he lacked information on the number of workfare recipients who actually found jobs, and he <b>also</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> account for 40% of the welfare recipients who had been cut from the list. A number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of Results May Vary track listing, Page Hamilton of Helmet and Rivers Cuomo of Weezer recorded songs with Limp Bizkit for the album; Al Jourgensen of Ministry also joined the band in the studio. Jourgensen claims that he convinced Fred Durst to strip naked and wear a cowboy hat while singing. The contributions of all three were omitted from the finished album. Bubba Sparxxx joined Durst in a Los Angeles studio, but his contributions <b>also</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> make the album. Durst wrote over 30 songs with Limp Bizkit drummer John Otto and the band's bassist, Sam Rivers. During production of Results May Vary, Durst listened to the Cure, Patsy Cline, Mazzy Star and classical music.|$|E
