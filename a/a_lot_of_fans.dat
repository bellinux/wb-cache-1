The movie chronicles {{the rise and fall}} of the singer's career, detailing Trevi's first encounter with Andrade (who became her mentor), her brief tenure in a band, her rise to musical stardom, a sex scandal involving minors, and her imprisonment in Brazil. Espinosa won the role after a month-and-a-half casting process, stating that [...] "I do not know how many actresses were , or who they were, but once I got the role I knew it was a big responsibility, because it is a character who is alive and has <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fans,</b> I had to do it well. It is a very complex character, full of nuances, with great force". Espinosa took singing lessons and had to learn Trevi's accent. Also, to fully prepare for the role, the actress was assigned a choreographer and worked with the film director to find the right tone for the scenes. Espinosa watched Trevi's interviews, concerts and films to be able to play her. [...] "The role was meant for me", Espinosa said to Noticine.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the entire second season, IGN {{believed}} that despite the premiere's [...] "great start", the first half contained [...] "some rather lackluster episodes" [...] that [...] "made <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fans</b> worried and got the rumors of cancellation circulating"; the second half however [...] "showed that Fringe {{is still one of the}} best sci-fi series on TV". The A.V. Club agreed, and called the first half [...] "entertaining" [...] but [...] "never essential" [...] while noting a great improvement mid-way through the season, as [...] "the show finally grounded its freak-of-the-week weirdness in deep sadness". The A.V. Club continued, [...] "...The season-two episode [...] "Peter" [...] finally dramatized the moment that changed [...] life, giving the series' overarching storyline a devastating emotional core, based in a father's love instead of in theoretical concepts. It only got better from there, as the series expanded its world by further making those concepts concrete. Fringe is that rare blend of inventive ideas, wild ambition, and unexpected soulfulness." [...] The Seattle Post-Intelligencer believed that by the end of the season [...] "Fringe had truly found its footing, doing daring, experimental episodes like the musical [...] "Brown Betty"... and heartbreaking stand alone episodes, like [...] "White Tulip", (which might be my favorite hour of television this year that wasn't Lost-related)." ...|$|E

500|$|There was {{a strong}} {{reaction}} from the show's viewers. Adler said, [...] "I've heard from <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fans</b> how important this character is for them because it's important to watch the internal struggle, the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted." [...] He wants Karofsky to [...] "accept himself and come out because [...] {{it would be a}} beacon of hope for everyone else who's struggling", and noted, [...] "people do get hope from Glee." [...] He also said, [...] "I think [...] trusts me to do what I'm doing with the character, which is one heck of a compliment from him." [...] Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, [...] "This show is by nature optimistic and I think a character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves or do something dark. But I also love Max and I love that character and I sorta want that character to have a happy ending." [...] At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as [...] "very powerful. Chilling, terrifying, horrifying, yet, at the same time, heartbreaking. … Because there are kids who have messaged me since that episode saying they used to hear that line spoken to them {{day in and day out}} at school", and they dreaded school because of it.|$|E
500|$|F-Zero GX and AX was {{the first}} {{significant}} video game collaboration between Nintendo and Sega. After Sega transited from first to third-party development in 2001, the two companies developed a close relationship and worked together on F-Zero GX and AX. Amusement Vision president, Toshihiro Nagoshi, was working on Super Monkey Ball for GameCube which opened up {{the opportunity for a}} collaboration between the two companies. Since Sega helped to develop Nintendo's Triforce arcade system, the company wanted to support it with software that would [...] "stand out and draw attention to Nintendo's platform." [...] Nagoshi was suggested to develop a driving game and agreed under the stipulation he could come up with something unique—which was working on the next installment in Nintendo's F-Zero series. During its development, Nagoshi focused on what he called the self-explanatory [...] "Interface" [...] of the game, and [...] "Rhythm"—to give the way the tracks are laid out a rhythmic feel. Miyamoto stated [...] " [...] have gained <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fans</b> among current game developers, including famous producers like Mr. Nagoshi who grew up playing Nintendo games and are big fans of some of our titles." [...] In 2002, Nagoshi claimed that 1991's F-Zero [...] "actually taught me what a game should be" [...] and that it served as an influence for him to create Daytona USA and other racing games. Before development started on F-Zero GX and AX, he mentioned abandoning the project due to personal pressures he faced to make a great impression on Nintendo and personal admiration of an established franchise. Still the announcement that Nintendo had handled development of one of its franchises to former competitor Sega came as a surprise to some critics.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} Mel Gibson {{as a guest}} voice. Scully {{had previously}} met him while writing jokes for a school fundraiser {{along with his wife}} Julie Thacker. Gibson and Daniel Stern were the hosts and needed jokes for the event. It turned out that Gibson was a fan of the show and watched it with his children. With that knowledge, it did not take Scully long to invite him to do a part. Gibson was willing to do the job and even came in on three separate occasions to do retakes – mostly because he knew his children would be watching. Unlike most guest voices, Gibson recorded the show along with the cast. On one occasion, it turned out that a joke written for Gibson actually did happen in real life. The writing staff wanted Gibson to say that he would urinate behind a dumpster, because it sounded like {{it would not be a}} classy thing to do for a movie star. He had, however, already done that during a couple of film premieres because he can feel trapped in a public toilet with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fans.</b> Gibson was surprised the writers knew about the story, but it turned out to be a coincidence. Otherwise, the episode frequently references films Gibson appeared in. After the studio cart crashes, Gibson says to Homer, [...] "I'm getting too old for this crap," [...] a reference to a line said by Danny Glover's character Roger Murtaugh to Gibson's character Martin Riggs in the Lethal Weapon film series. A poster for his film Braveheart is on the wall in the editing room and the Road Warrior car from the 1981 film Mad Max 2 is also featured. In addition to Gibson, Jack Burns guest starred in the episode, voicing a film studio executive named Edward Christian. His frequent use of the terms [...] "Huh?" [...] and [...] "You know what I mean?" [...] is a reference to a comedy routine performed by Burns and Avery Schreiber. The episode also features John Travolta, in whose private jet Gibson flies to Springfield, but his voice was imitated by Dan Castellaneta.|$|E
