5|$|The mediastinal {{surface of}} the right lung is {{indented}} {{by a number of}} nearby structures. The heart sits in an impression called the cardiac impression. Above the hilum of the lung is an arched groove for the azygos vein, and above this is a wide groove for the superior vena cava and right brachiocephalic vein; behind this, and close {{to the top of the}} lung is <b>a</b> <b>groove</b> for the brachiocephalic artery. There is <b>a</b> <b>groove</b> for the esophagus behind the hilum and the pulmonary ligament, and near the lower part of the esophageal groove is a deeper groove for the inferior vena cava before it enters the heart.|$|E

5|$|Mimi pulls Carey in two {{opposite}} directions. Most of {{the tracks}} find her paired with the hottest hip hop producers of the day; there, she exercises restraint and settles into <b>a</b> <b>groove.</b> But on the rest, she does what comes most naturally to her—belting to her heart's desire, perhaps to mollify those who don't care much for her detours into raunchier rap territory.|$|E
5|$|Dance Dance Revolution, {{released}} in 1998, is a rhythm {{game in which}} players dance on pressure-sensitive pads in an order dictated by on-screen instructions. The game was highly successful both in and outside Japan, unlike games such as GuitarFreaks, DrumMania and Beatmania, though the latter had some success in Europe. Released the same year, Enix's Bust <b>a</b> <b>Groove</b> features a similar focus on dancing but employs a more conventional input method. The game contains competitive one-on-one battles, and grants the player more freedom than typical rhythm games.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{have what}} can be {{described}} as an incomplete gut; the gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach and possesses a single opening to the outside, which operates as both a mouth and anus. Waste and undigested matter is excreted through this opening. The mouth is typically slit-like in shape, and bears <b>a</b> <b>groove</b> at one or both ends. The groove, termed a siphonophore, is ciliated, and helps to move food particles inwards and circulate water through the gastrovascular cavity.|$|E

40|$|The {{transition}} point where water begins to accumulate {{on the surface}} during spray evaporative cooling was investigated experimentally to determine the temperatures and corresponding heat flux at which this transition occurs. Several pressure ranges were considered including one below the triple point of water. Additionally, the results using <b>a</b> <b>grooved</b> surface were compared to those using a smooth surface. It was determined that <b>a</b> <b>grooved</b> surface {{has no effect on}} the heat transfer...|$|R

5|$|Shark {{teeth are}} {{embedded}} in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw, and are constantly replaced throughout life. Multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in <b>a</b> <b>groove</b> {{on the inside of}} the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt; some sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime. The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. In most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the cookiecutter shark.|$|E
5|$|The thorax {{has three}} segments, {{each with a}} pair of robust legs, and a pair of {{membranous}} wings on the hind two segments. The front legs of corbiculate bees bear combs for cleaning the antennae, and in many species the hind legs bear pollen baskets, flattened sections with incurving hairs to secure the collected pollen. The wings are synchronised in flight and the somewhat smaller hind wings connect to the forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to <b>a</b> <b>groove</b> in the forewing. The abdomen has nine segments, the hindermost three being modified into the sting.|$|E
5|$|Their early albums Burn My Eyes and The More Things Change... show <b>a</b> <b>groove</b> {{metal and}} thrash metal approach, similar to bands like Pantera and Exhorder. The albums also {{featured}} technical drumming by Chris Kontos and Dave McClain. The band changed their musical {{direction for the}} albums The Burning Red (1999) and Supercharger (2001), which {{have been described as}} displaying a nu metal sound. These albums featured rapping by Robb Flynn and simpler guitar riffs, but retaining part of their aggressive sound. This change in direction resulted in criticism from many fans because of the popularity of nu metal at the time.|$|E
50|$|A {{bi-metallic}} R5 coin {{with added}} security features, including <b>a</b> <b>grooved</b> edge and micro-lettering on the reverse, {{was introduced in}} 2004.|$|R
50|$|Square and {{hexagonal}} wires were possibly {{made using}} a swaging technique. In this method a metal rod was struck between grooved metal blocks, or between <b>a</b> <b>grooved</b> punch and <b>a</b> <b>grooved</b> metal anvil. Swaging {{is of great}} antiquity, possibly dating {{to the beginning of}} the 2nd millennium BCE in Egypt and in the Bronze and Iron Ages in Europe for torcs and fibulae. Twisted square-section wires are a very common filigree decoration in early Etruscan jewelry.|$|R

5|$|Areoles {{are highly}} {{specialized}} and very condensed shoots or branches. In a normal shoot, nodes bearing leaves or flowers would be separated by lengths of stem (internodes). In an areole, the nodes {{are so close}} together, they form a single structure. The areole may be circular, elongated into an oval shape, or even separated into two parts; the two parts may be visibly connected in some way (e.g. by <b>a</b> <b>groove</b> in the stem) or appear entirely separate (a dimorphic areole). The part nearer {{the top of the}} stem then produces flowers, the other part spines. Areoles often have multicellular hairs (trichomes) that give the areole a hairy or woolly appearance, sometimes of a distinct color such as yellow or brown.|$|E
5|$|In the Filibranchia and Eulamellibranchia, {{water is}} {{drawn into the}} shell from the {{posterior}} ventral surface of the animal, passes upwards through the gills, and doubles back to be expelled just above the intake. In burrowing species, there may be two elongated, retractable siphons reaching up to the seabed, one each for the inhalant and exhalant streams of water. The gills of filter-feeding bivalves are known as ctenidia and have become highly modified to increase their ability to capture food. For example, the cilia on the gills, which originally served to remove unwanted sediment, have become adapted to capture food particles, and transport them in {{a steady stream of}} mucus to the mouth. The filaments of the gills are also much longer than those in more primitive bivalves, and are folded over to create <b>a</b> <b>groove</b> through which food can be transported. The structure of the gills varies considerably, and can serve as a useful means for classifying bivalves into groups.|$|E
5|$|Relatively new {{cells in}} <b>a</b> <b>groove</b> {{on the edges}} of the mantle secrete {{material}} that extends the periostracum. These cells are gradually displaced to the underside of the mantle by more recent cells in the groove, and switch to secreting the mineralized material of the shell valves. In other words, {{on the edge of the}} valve the periostracum is extended first, and then reinforced by extension of the mineralized layers under the periostracum. In most species the edge of the mantle also bears movable bristles, often called chaetae or setae, that may help defend the animals and may act as sensors. In some brachiopods groups of chaetae help to channel the flow of water into and out of the mantle cavity.|$|E

5|$|The tip of {{the angular}} is {{situated}} close to {{the midpoint of the}} bone in K. langenbergensis rather than being at the back as in K. guimarotae. In both species, the back of the angular contributes to the retroarticular process. The inner surface of the angular is roughened in K. guimarotae, and the top margin of the inner wall transitions from an upward-projecting tip at the front to a low, rounded crest at the back; the same margin maintains its height along the angular in K. langenbergensis. The surangular bears a thin, forward-projecting process that, in K. langenbergensis, extends forward {{to the back of the}} tooth row and bears <b>a</b> <b>groove</b> on the bottom. The presence of the oval-shaped external mandibular fenestra is unique to the genus among atoposaurids.|$|E
5|$|The vagus nerves, {{from which}} the {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves branch, exit the skull at the jugular foramen and travel within the carotid sheath alongside the carotid arteries through the neck. The recurrent laryngeal nerves branch off the vagus, the left at the aortic arch, and the right at the right subclavian artery. The left RLN passes {{in front of the}} arch, and then wraps underneath and behind it. After branching, the nerves typically ascend in <b>a</b> <b>groove</b> at the junction of the trachea and esophagus. They then pass behind the posterior, middle part of the outer lobes of the thyroid gland and enter the larynx underneath the inferior constrictor muscle, passing into the larynx just posterior to the cricothyroid joint. The terminal branch is called the inferior laryngeal nerve.|$|E
5|$|The {{zebra shark}} has a {{cylindrical}} {{body with a}} large, slightly flattened head and a short, blunt snout. The eyes are small and placed {{on the sides of}} the head; the spiracles are located behind them and are as large or larger. The last 3 of the 5 short gill slits are situated over the pectoral fin bases, and the fourth and fifth slits are much closer together than the others. Each nostril has a short barbel and <b>a</b> <b>groove</b> running from it to the mouth. The mouth is nearly straight, with three lobes on the lower lip and furrows at the corners. There are 2833 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2232 tooth rows in the lower jaw; each tooth has a large central cusp flanked by two smaller ones.|$|E

50|$|The golden to olive-yellow convex cap is 3-7 cm in diameter, is hygrophanous, {{and usually}} has <b>a</b> <b>grooved</b> edge. The darker central disc has a slight velvety tomentum.|$|R
5000|$|Below {{the medial}} {{end of the}} {{superior}} orbital fissure is <b>a</b> <b>grooved</b> surface, which forms the posterior wall of the pterygopalatine fossa, and is pierced by the foramen rotundum.|$|R
5|$|There are 5 premaxillary {{teeth in}} both species, {{the fourth of}} {{which is about a}} third larger {{relative}} to the others. The maxilla has 12 distinct sockets in K. langenbergensis. Excluding the pseudocaniniforms, the maxillary tooth size remains roughly constant but gradually decreases after the pseudocaniniforms in both species; all tooth sockets after the twelfth are replaced by a continuous trough. In total, K. guimarotae had at least 15 maxillary teeth, and K. langenbergensis 17 or 18. Meanwhile, the dentary exhibits 21 teeth in K. langenbergensis and at least 20 in K. guimarotae. Like the maxilla, distinct sockets for dentary teeth are replaced by <b>a</b> <b>groove</b> from the eleventh tooth backwards in K. langenbergensis.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in <b>a</b> <b>groove</b> on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E
5|$|The lingual row {{contains}} three cusps and the labial probably five (the {{broken corner}} renders the number uncertain). Transverse ridges, separated by deep valleys, connect the lingual and labial cusps; therefore, the cusps are not strongly separate, but rather fused. The lingual cusps are larger and separated by larger valleys than the labial ones. At {{the front of}} the tooth is a triangular structure consisting of the first lingual and the first two labial cusps. A low crest connects the first lingual to the first labial cusp and a stronger crest, separated from the first by a relatively shallow valley, connects the second lingual to the first labial cusp. Behind this structure, a second triangle is formed by two crests passing from the second lingual cusp to two cusps at the labial side (the back of the two is broken away, but its existence is presumed from the crown pattern). The front of these two crests is interrupted by <b>a</b> <b>groove.</b> The third lingual cusp is also connected to two crests, which encircle a small depression and presumably connected to one or more labial cusps, which are missing from the fossil.|$|E
50|$|Between this {{ridge and}} the {{anterior}} border is <b>a</b> <b>grooved</b> triangular area, {{the upper part}} of which gives attachment to the Temporalis, the lower part to some fibers of the Buccinator.|$|R
