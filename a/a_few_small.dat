5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of Euro-Americans in the 19thcentury, the John Day basin was frequented by Sahaptin people who hunted, fished, and {{gathered}} roots and berries in the region. After road-building made the valley more accessible, settlers established farms, ranches, and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>small</b> towns along the river and its tributaries. Paleontologists have been unearthing and studying the fossils in the region since 1864, when Thomas Condon, a missionary and amateur geologist, recognized their importance and made them known globally.

5|$|Lightburn {{responded to}} the threat by {{splitting}} his army into two brigades plus <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>small</b> posts.

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{archaeological evidence}} of human habitation {{of the territory}} of the city of San Francisco dates to 3000BC. The Yelamu group of the Ohlone people resided in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>small</b> villages when an overland Spanish exploration party, led by Don Gaspar de Portolà, arrived on November 2, 1769, the first documented European visit to San Francisco Bay. Seven years later, on March 28, 1776, the Spanish established the Presidio of San Francisco, followed by a mission, Mission San Francisco de Asís (Mission Dolores), established by the Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} diamond synthesis {{was achieved}} on February 16, 1953 in Stockholm by ASEA (Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget), one of Sweden's major electrical manufacturing companies. Starting in 1949, ASEA employed {{a team of}} five scientists and engineers {{as part of a}} top-secret diamond-making project code-named QUINTUS. The team used a bulky split-sphere apparatus designed by Baltzar von Platen and Anders Kämpe. Pressure was maintained within the device at an estimated 8.4GPa for an hour. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>small</b> diamonds were produced, but not of gem quality or size. The work was not reported until the 1980s. During the 1980s, a new competitor emerged in Korea, a company named Iljin Diamond; it was followed by hundreds of Chinese enterprises. Iljin Diamond allegedly accomplished diamond synthesis in 1988 by misappropriating trade secrets from GE via a Korean former GE employee.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Monsabert's attempt to {{liberate}} Marseille commenced. At first, a German force at Aubagne was defeated before French troops attacked the city directly. Unlike Toulon, the German commander at Marseille did not evacuate the civilian population, which became increasingly hostile. The resulting fighting with FFI troops further weakened the German units, which were exhausted from partisan fighting. The Wehrmacht {{was not able}} to defend on a broad front and soon crumbled into numerous isolated strongpoints. On 27August most of the city was liberated, with only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>small</b> strongpoints remaining, and on 28August German troops issued the official surrender. The battle caused 1,825 French casualties, but 11,000 German troops were captured. In both harbours, German engineers had demolished port facilities to deny their use to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Discontent {{began to}} spread among the people, which {{sometimes}} escalated to violence. Casamance has since experienced years of conflict which put local initiatives in jeopardy, such as nature reserves and the first network of villages. In 1998, {{in the middle of}} the conflict, the French commune of Bon-Encontre committed to providing Carabane with humanitarian aid, both economically and culturally. Carabane has remained one of the calmest areas of Casamance throughout the conflict. Nonetheless, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>small</b> incidents were reported around April 2000. The rebels may have wanted to take advantage of Carabane's reputation to attract media attention.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{inclement weather}} also {{hampered}} the Americans' advance, and until May 15 the recapturing forces were unsure {{of whether the}} Japanese had held their position or retreated. When the fog lifted on that day, {{it became clear that}} the Japanese had retreated further west. However, when the American forces gave chase, they were immediately slowed by an accidental air strike upon them by an American aircraft. By May 29, the Japanese forces numbered only 700–1,000, and these troops attempted to run through the advancing American forces as a last show of defiance against the recapturing forces. By May 30, the Americans had recaptured Attu, and although <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>small</b> pockets of Japanese troops remained on the island, the Battle of Attu had essentially concluded.|$|E

5|$|In 1244 {{a band of}} Khwarezmian mercenaries {{travelling}} to Egypt {{to serve}} As-Salih Ismail, Emir of Damascus, seemingly of their own volition, captured Jerusalem en route and defeated a combined Christian and Syrian army at the Battle of La Forbie. In response, LouisIX, king of France, organised a Crusade, called the Seventh Crusade, to attack Egypt, arriving in 1249. It was not a success. Louis was defeated at Mansura and captured as he retreated to Damietta. Another truce was agreed upon for a ten-year period, and Louis was ransomed. Louis remained in Syria until 1254 to consolidate the Crusader states. From 1265 to 1271, the Mamluk sultan Baibars drove the Franks to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>small</b> coastal outposts.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the fires, erosion was a particular concern, especially as the rains were heavy the following year. Helicopters dropped millions of gallons of water on the fires, and water retrieval from <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>small</b> creeks actually dropped the water level temporarily. Stream flow was also affected by water-pumping operations. The more than a million gallons of diammonium phosphate-based fire-retardant material polluted some streams, but this too was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality. Fire fighting foams used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel fires. They are very low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by the spring of 1989.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{damage was}} minimal {{as a result}} of Katrina. Only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>small</b> mudslides were reported, along with some minor flooding, as the storm tracked across Central America. It was {{estimated}} that between 10 and 15inches (250 to 375mm) of rain fell across parts of the region {{as a result of}} Katrina, with one report of 3.58inches (91mm) in six hours from the island of San Andrés east of Nicaragua. Roughly 1,200 people were evacuated to emergency shelters in Honduras due to flooding. At least five bridges sustained damage and the cities of Tocoa and Trujillo were isolated as the Aguán and Siline rivers overflowed their banks. The water pipes recently constructed after being destroyed by Hurricane Mitch, worth HNL 170,000 (US$9,000) were once again destroyed by Katrina. The most severely affected area in Honduras was the Valle del Aguán.|$|E
