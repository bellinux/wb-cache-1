500|$|The {{legislative}} {{history of the}} Judiciary Act of 1789 reveals little consideration of criminal appeals. Caleb Strong, a Senator {{at the time of}} its drafting, described §22 of that act as follows: [...] "Writs of Error from the Circuit to the Supr. Court in all Causes not criminal of which the Circuit Court has original Cognizance and the Matter in Dispute does not exceed 2000 Dolrs." [...] Senator (and future Supreme Court justice) William Paterson noticed the lack of provision for criminal appeals in preliminary notes and a draft outline of a speech he gave on June 23, 1789. According to Rossman, Paterson may have viewed the inability of the government to <b>appeal</b> (<b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>court</b> in the nation's capitol) as a [...] "protection for ordinary citizens." [...] The issue of criminal appeals was not mentioned in the House debates.|$|E

In the second place, we are all equally desirous--whatever difference of opinion may otherwise exist--to make this informal inquiry a means, if possible, of avoiding the painful publicity which would result from an <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Court</b> of Law." ...|$|E

I am not referring now to Mr. Brinkworth's chance of clearing himself from an odious suspicion which rests upon him, and upon another Person present. That is an after-matter. The object immediately before us--so far as a woman can pretend to understand it--is to establish my step-daughter's right to call Mr. Brinkworth to account in the character of his wife. If the result, so far, fails to satisfy us in that particular, we shall not hesitate to <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Court</b> of Law."

6000|$|When Mr. Hastings went to Bengal in {{the year}} 1772, he had a {{direction}} exactly similar to this which he has resisted in his own case: it was to inquire into grievances and abuses. In consequence of this direction, he proposes {{a plan for the}} regulation of the Company's service, and one part of that plan was just what you would expect from him,--that is, the power of destroying every Company's servant without the least possibility of his being heard in his own defence or taking any one step to justify himself, and of dismissing him at his own discretion: and the reason he gives for it is this. [...] "I shall forbear to comment upon the above propositions: if just and proper, their utility will be self-apparent. One clause only in the last article may require some explanation, namely, the power proposed for the Governor of recalling any person from his station without assigning a reason for it. In the charge of oppression," [...] (now here you will find the reason why Mr. Hastings wishes to <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>court</b> of justice, rather than to give satisfaction to his employers,) [...] "though supported by the cries of the people and the most authentic representations, it is yet impossible in most cases to obtain legal proofs of it; and unless the discretionary power which I have recommended be somewhere lodged, the assurance of impunity from any formal inquiry will baffle every order of the board, as, on the other hand, the fear of the consequence will restrain every man within the bounds of his duty, if he knows himself liable to suffer by the effects of a single control." [...] You see Mr. Hastings himself is of opinion that the cries of oppression, though extorted from a whole people by the iron hand of severity,--that these cries of a whole people, attended even with authentic documents sufficient to satisfy the mind of any man, may be totally insufficient to convict the oppressor in a court; and yet to that court, whose competence he denies, to that very court, he appeals, in that he puts his trust, and upon that ground he refuses to perform the just promise he had given of any explanation to those who had employed him.|$|E

30|$|Since The Charter of Workers Rights (Law 300 / 1970), {{individual}} dismissals {{are allowed}} in large firms {{only if there}} exists a “just cause” (for productive reasons or for severe misconduct of the employee). More precisely, a worker can be fired for “justified objective motive” that is, “for justified reasons concerning the production activity or the organization of labor in the firm”; or for “justified subjective motive” that is, “in case of a significantly inadequate fulfillment of the employee’s tasks specified by the contract”. Moreover, large firms are required {{to give to the}} employee a term of notice in order to proceed with an individual dismissal, whose length depends on the tenure of the worker, with detailed indications {{of the reasons for the}} dismissal. The worker can easily <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Court</b> against the dismissal.

In addition, the firm has to pay the legal costs and a penalty for the delayed payment of social security contributions of up to 200 % of the original sum due.|$|E

40|$|Judges {{will tell}} you that they are {{comparatively}} poor rate regulators. The specialized, technical competence and supervisory capacity that public utilities commissions enjoy are usually absent from judicial chambers. Nonetheless, when granting antitrust remedies-particularly remedies for monopolistic abuse of intellectual property-courts sometimes purport to act as rate regulators for the licensing or sale of the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s assets. At the outset, we should distinguish between two forms ofjudicial rate setting. In one form, a court (or the FTC in its adjudicative capacity) grants a compulsory license and sets a specific rate as part of a final judgment or an order. The established rate merges with the final judgment, just like a damages award, requiring no further action from the court. Examples here include the FFC 2 ̆ 7 s recent decisions in Rambus and N-Data, where the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s order either set an actual rate or a maximum rate for patent licenses. The Supreme Court has suggested that such compulsory licensing and judicial rate setting may be a preferred remedy in cases of monopolistic abuse of patents. Another form of antitrust remedy involves merely potential judicial rate setting. Here, the relevant judgment requires the defendant to license on reasonable (or reasonable and nondiscriminatory-RAND) terms and reserves jurisdiction for any potential licensee who is unhappy with the rate offered by the defendant to petition the court to set a rate. Significantly, however, such 2 ̆ 7 jurisdiction retention 2 ̆ 2 judgments do not necessarily involve a court in ever setting a rate. Instead, the mere threat of rate setting frames future licensing negotiations. The licensor comes to the bargaining table bereft of the power to impose monopolistic royalty rates, given that the licensee can always <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>court</b> to set a monopoly-free rate. This essay is largely concerned with the latter form of judicial rate setting-the jurisdiction retention mode-about which it makes three general points. First, judges 2 ̆ 7 lack of expertise to set rates should not be thought a major detraction from this sort of remedy. Courts rarely exercise their rate-setting powers even when they retain them. The interesting question is not whether courts are any good at setting rates-they are not, but that may not matter-but what happens to the bargain of the licensor and the licensee when the shadow of a rate-setting court lies upon them. The short answer is that the shadow of a rate-setting court, as distinguished from the more amorphous shadow of a damages-assessing antitrust court, makes equality the dominant norm in the licensing of intellectual property. However egalitarian the general impulse of liberal society, {{it is not clear that}} equality is such a desirable norm when it comes to the licensing of intellectual property. Even so, in cases where the defendant has acquired monopoly power unlawfully, it is useful to have it bargaining with licensees under the shadow of an undefined cap on what it can demand as royalties...|$|E
