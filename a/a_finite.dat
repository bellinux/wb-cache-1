5|$|<b>A</b> <b>finite</b> {{field is}} a set of numbers with four {{generalized}} operations. The operations are called addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and have their usual properties, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity. An example of <b>a</b> <b>finite</b> field is the set of 13 numbers {0,1,2,…,12} using modular arithmetic. In this field, the results of any mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) is reduced modulo 13; that is, multiples of 13 are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range 0–12. For example, the result of 5×7=35mod13=9. Such finite fields can be defined for any prime p; using more sophisticated definitions, they can also be defined for any power m of a prime p'm. Finite fields are often called Galois fields, and are abbreviated as GF(p) or GF(p'm).|$|E

This restriction on the acceptable solutions allows some systems of Diophantine equations with more unknowns than equations to have <b>a</b> <b>finite</b> number of solutions; this is impossible for a system of linear equations when the solutions can be any real number (see Underdetermined system).|$|E

5|$|Early Islamic {{philosophers}} initially {{agreed with}} the Aristotelian view that light had no speed of travel. In 1021, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the Book of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of vision in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that light must have <b>a</b> <b>finite</b> speed, and that {{the speed of light}} is variable, decreasing in denser bodies. He argued that light is substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from our senses. Also in the 11th century, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī agreed that light has <b>a</b> <b>finite</b> speed, and observed that the speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{is better}} {{described}} as a non-contact force field having <b>a</b> <b>finite</b> range, albeit very short.

5|$|Many {{types of}} objects in {{abstract}} algebra can satisfy chain conditions, and usually if they satisfy an ascending chain condition, they are called Noetherian in her honor.

A Noetherian module is a module in which every strictly ascending chain of submodules becomes constant after <b>a</b> <b>finite</b> number of steps. A Noetherian space is a topological space in which every strictly ascending chain of open subspaces becomes constant after <b>a</b> <b>finite</b> number of steps; this definition makes the spectrum of a Noetherian ring a Noetherian topological space.|$|E
