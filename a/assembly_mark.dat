40|$|This mini-review synthesizes our {{understanding}} of the equilibrium behavior of particle models with short-range attractive and long-range repulsive (SALR) interactions.

Ordered structures, however, have yet to be obtained in experiments. In order to better understand the hurdles to periodic microphase <b>assembly,</b> <b>marked</b> theoretical and simulation advances have been made over the last few years. Here, we present recent progress in the study of microphases in models with SALR interactions using liquid-state theory and density-functional theory as well as numerical simulations. Combining these various approaches provides a description of periodic microphases, and give insights into the rich phenomenology of the surrounding disordered regime. Three additional ongoing research directions in the thermodynamics of models with SALR interactions are also presented...|$|R
