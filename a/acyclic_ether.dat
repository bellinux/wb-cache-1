40|$|The {{application}} of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry {{has contributed to}} the rapid progress of carbohydrate chemistry during the past ten years. The methods are indispensable tools in current research on carbohydrate reactions during pulping processes. <b>Acyclic</b> <b>ether,</b> ester, and oxime trimethylsilyl derivatives are useful for gas chromatographic analysis of alditols, aldoses, ketoses, aldonic acids, aldaric acids and uronic acids. These derivatives have been studied in detail by mass spectrometry and shown to be advantageous for structural analysis. The mass spectrometric fragmentation of glycosidic trimethylsilyl derivatives has also been investigated. An important application is the identification of products from methylation analysis...|$|E

40|$|International audienceUnimolecular decompositions of <b>acyclic</b> <b>ethers</b> {{through a}} pericyclic mechanism, i. e., alcohol elimination, {{have been shown}} to {{play a crucial role in}} the {{high-temperature}} combustion of these compounds. The production of new fuels derived from biomass has led to a renewed interest into the combustion chemistry of ethers. A large fraction of ethers produced as potential biofuels features a cyclic structure. The pericyclic reactions in these cyclic structures, with or without a lateral alkyl group, remains unknown. In this work, we performed a systematic theoretical study on the pericyclic reactions in <b>acyclic</b> and cyclic <b>ethers.</b> Envisaged concerted reactions includes the classical alcohol formation and a H 2 eliminations that was recently shown to play a non negligible role in the thermal decomposition of tetrahydrofuran [Proc. Combust. Inst., 35 (2015) 533]. Theoretical calculation performed in this work demonstrated that H 2 elimination in <b>acyclic</b> <b>ethers</b> is negligible. In the case of cyclic ethers (tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran), the branching ratio of the unimolecular pericyclic reaction strongly depends on the presence of a lateral alkyl group bonded to the carbon atom in position 2. If an alkyl group is present, the alcohol formation is favored through an exo 4 -center rearrangement, that we newly defined in this work. If no lateral alkyl group is available in position 2, endo alcohol formation and H 2 eliminations are equivalently important. Reaction rate rules were established to include pericyclic decomposition reactions in detailed chemical kinetic models of ether combustion...|$|R
40|$|Amination of C H bonds {{activated}} by ether oxygen atoms is facile with chloramine-T as nitrene source and copper(I) chloride in acetonitrile as catalyst. For cyclic ethers the hemiaminal products are generally stable {{and can be}} isolated pure. For <b>acyclic</b> <b>ethers,</b> the hemiaminal products, as expected, fragment with elimination of alcohol to yield imines. When activation of benzylic positions is remote through a conjugated system, stable benzylamine derivatives are isolated. Mechanistic studies are consistent with concerted insertion of an electrophilic nitrenoid into the C-H bond in the rate-determining step, though in an asynchronous manner with a more activated substrate...|$|R
40|$|Relative {{rates of}} {{hydrogen}} atom abstraction by photogenerated tert-butoxyl {{from a variety}} of cyclic and <b>acyclic</b> <b>ethers,</b> acetals, and orthoformates have been measured at - 600 C by an EPR spectroscopic technique. There is a pronounced stereoelectronic effect which produces high rates of abstraction from those C-H bonds adjacent to oxygen which have a relatively small dihedral angle (ca. 300) with respect to the p-type orbital(s) on the oxygen(s). For C-H bonds which have a large dihedral angle (ca. 900) abstraction is very much slower.

40|$|The {{formation}} and dissociation of dimer complexes {{consisting of a}} transition metal ion and two polyether ligands is examined in a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. Reactions of three transition metals (Ni, Cu, Co) with three crown <b>ethers</b> and four <b>acyclic</b> <b>ethers</b> (glymes) are studied. Singly charged species are created from ion-molecule reactions between laser-desorbed monopositive metal ions and the neutral polyethers. Doubly charged complexes are generated from electrospray ionization of solutions containing metal salts and polyethers. For the singly charged complexes, the capability for dimer formation by the ethers {{is dependent on the}} number of available coordination sites on the ligand and its ability to fully coordinate the metal ion. For example, 18 -crown- 6 never forms dimer complexes, but 12 -crown- 4 readily forms dimers. For the more flexible <b>acyclic</b> <b>ethers,</b> the ligands that have four or more oxygen atoms do not form dimer complexes because the acyclic ligands have sufficient flexibility to wrap around the metal ion and prevent attachment of a second ligand. For the doubly charged complexes, dimers are observed for all of the crown ethers and glymes, thus showing no dependence on the flexibility or number of coordination sites of the polyether. The nonselectivity of dimer formation is attributed to the higher charge density of the doubly charged metal center, resulting in stronger coordination abilities. Collisionally activated dissociation is used to evaluate the structures of the metal-polyether dimer complexes. Radical fragmentation processes are observed for some of the singly charged dimer complexes because these pathways allow the monopositive metal ion to attain a more favorable 2 + oxidation state. These radical losses are observed for the dimer complexes but not for the monomer complexes because the dimer structures have two independent ligands, a feature that enhances the coordination geometry of the complex and allows more flexibility for the rearrangements necessary for loss of radical species. Dissociation of the doubly charged complexes generated by electrospray ionization does not result in losses of radical neutrals because the metal ions already exist in favorable 2 + oxidation states...|$|R

40|$|Readily {{available}} phosphoramidites incorporating TADDOL-related diols with an acyclic backbone {{turned out}} to be excellent ligands for asymmetric gold catalysis, allowing a number of mechanistically different transformations to be performed with good to outstanding enantioselectivities. This includes [2 + 2] and [4 + 2] cycloadditions of ene-allenes, cycloisomerizations of enynes, hydroarylation reactions with formation of indolines, as well as intramolecular hydroaminations and hydroalkoxylations of allenes. Their preparative relevance is underscored by an application to an efficient synthesis of the antidepressive drug candidate (−) -GSK 1360707. The distinctive design element of the new ligands is their <b>acyclic</b> dimethyl <b>ether</b> backbone in lieu of the (isopropylidene) acetal moiety characteristic for traditional TADDOL’s. Crystallographic data in combination with computational studies allow the efficiency of the gold complexes endowed with such one-point binding ligands to be rationalized...|$|R

This sequence provides {{high levels of}} stereocontrol for the generation of simple <b>acyclic</b> (Z) -enol <b>ethers.</b> These enol ethers undergo either thermal or Lewis acid accelerated Claisen rearrangements to provide products of high diastereopurity.

40|$|Liquid phase {{oxidation}} {{of organic}} substrates under {{an atmosphere of}} oxygen catalyzed by metal complexes is reviewed in Chapter 1. Also included in the review are homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis and free radical autoxidation reactions. The selective catalytic oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons is described in Chapter 2. Anhydrous CoCl 2, CoCl 2 /CrCl 3, or CoCl 2 /ZrCl 4 were used as the catalysts to oxidize a variety of substrates {{in the presence of}} diglyme or a mixture of diglyme and MEK (1 : 3). These substrates included substituted toluenes and other benzylic hydrocarbons. The reactions afforded fair to excellent yields of the product aldehydes or ketones under mild conditions. It was discovered that the selectivity of these reactions is strongly influenced by the catalyst and the solvent. Selective catalytic oxidation of ethers and cyclic acetals using cobalt chloride is described in Chapter 3. The oxidation of cyclic ethers gives the corresponding lactones in reasonable to excellent yields. However, 2, 3 -dihydrobenzofuran leads to no reaction. Oxidation of <b>acyclic</b> alkyl benzyl <b>ethers</b> to the corresponding esters afforded yields which were dependent on the stability of the alkyl radicals. The more stable the alkyl radical, the lower the yield of the ester obtained. In addition, oxidation of <b>acyclic</b> and heterocyclic <b>ethers</b> is described. An investigation of the reaction mechanism of this process was also studied. Finally, the oxidation of 2 -substituted 1, 3 -dioxolanes afforded high yields of formate esters and acids.

40|$|Homogeneous palladium-catalyzed Heck {{vinylation}} of aryl chlorides {{was investigated}} under air using Herrmann’s palladacycle and the P(t-Bu) 3 -liberating salt [(t-Bu) 3 PH]BF 4. Based on the results, controlled microwave heating was utilized to accelerate model Heck reactions with aryl chlorides down to 30 min employing an electron-poor olefin and {{a mixture of}} an ionic liquid and 1, 4 -dioxane as solvent. For the first time, a highly regioselective general protocol has been developed for palladium-catalyzed terminal (β-) arylation of <b>acyclic</b> vinyl <b>ethers</b> using inexpensive aryl chlorides as starting materials and the preligand [(t-Bu) 3 PH]BF 4 as the key additive. This swift and straightforward protocol exploits non-inert conditions and controlled microwave heating to reduce handling and processing times, and aqueous DMF or environmentally friendly PEG- 200 as the reaction medium. Somewhat higher selectivity for the linear β-product was observed in PEG- 200. DFT calculations were performed at the B 3 LYP level of theory for the regioselectivity-determining insertion step in the Heck reaction following the neutral pathway. A series of para-substituted phenylpalladium(II) complexes was investigated in the computational study. The calculations support a ligand-driven selectivity rationale, where the electronic and steric influence of the bulky P(t-Bu) 3 ligand provides improved β-selectivity. The preparative methodology was used to synthesize the β-adrenergic blocking agent Betaxolol. Highly stereoselective Pd(0) -catalyzed β-arylation and β-vinylation of a tetra-substituted cyclopentenyl ether have been accomplished using a chiral, pyrrolidine-based and substrate-bound palladium(II) -directing group under neutral reaction conditions. To {{the best of the}} author’s knowledge, this P(t-Bu) 3 -mediated method represents the first examples of the successful utilization of aryl and vinyl chlorides in asymmetric Heck reactions. The Heck arylation products formed were hydrolyzed and isolated as the corresponding quaternary 2 -aryl- 2 -methyl cyclopentanones in good to moderate two-step yields with excellent stereoselectivity (90 - 96 % ee). Inclusion of vinyl triflates under neutral reaction conditions and one aryl triflate equipped with a strongly electron-withdrawing para-cyano substituent under cationic conditions increased the preparative usefulness of the methodology. Furthermore, diastereoselective Heck arylation of both five- and six-membered cyclic vinyl ethers with aryl bromides, using the identical chiral auxiliary and suitable Pd sources, was performed. Arylated products from the tetra-substituted cyclopentenyl ether were also in this case hydrolyzed to the corresponding 2 -aryl- 2 -methyl cyclopentanones with high to excellent enantioselectivity (85 - 94 % ee). Despite low reaction rates and relatively modest yields, arylation reactions with the tri-substituted cyclohexenyl ether were found to be highly diastereoselective (94 - 98 % de). Thus, an attractive supplement to direct Pd(0) -catalyzed α-arylation protocols, particularly when the use of organic chlorides, aryl bromides, and milder reaction conditions are of great importance, have been developed...|$|R
