5|$|Maximus {{is one of}} {{the last}} men to be {{recognized}} by both the Orthodox and Catholic Churches as a Father of the Church. In the encyclical Spe Salvi (2007), Pope Benedict XVI called Maximus 'the great Greek doctor of the Church', although it's not clear if the Pontiff intended to nominate Maximus 'Doctor of the Church' or to say that he <b>already</b> <b>was</b> one.|$|E
5|$|In 431 BC, while peace <b>already</b> <b>was</b> precarious, ArchidamusII, Sparta's king, sent a new {{delegation}} to Athens, {{demanding that the}} Athenians submit to Sparta's demands. This deputation {{was not allowed to}} enter Athens, as Pericles had already passed a resolution according to which no Spartan deputation would be welcomed if the Spartans had previously initiated any hostile military actions. The Spartan army was at this time gathered at Corinth, and, citing this as a hostile action, the Athenians refused to admit their emissaries. With his last attempt at negotiation thus declined, Archidamus invaded Attica, but found no Athenians there; Pericles, aware that Sparta's strategy would be to invade and ravage Athenian territory, had previously arranged to evacuate the entire population of the region to within the walls of Athens.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} when Æthelberht became a Christian. It is possible, despite Bede's account, that he <b>already</b> <b>was</b> a Christian before Augustine's mission arrived. It is likely that Liudhard and Bertha pressed Æthelberht to {{consider}} becoming a Christian {{before the arrival of}} the mission, and it is also likely that a condition of Æthelberht's marriage to Bertha was that Æthelberht would consider conversion. Conversion via the influence of the Frankish court would have been seen as an explicit recognition of Frankish overlordship, however, so it is possible that Æthelberht's delay of his conversion until it could be accomplished via Roman influence, might have been an assertion of independence from Frankish control. It also has been argued that Augustine's hesitation—he turned back to Rome, asking to be released from the mission—is an indication that Æthelberht was a pagan at the time Augustine was sent.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{indication}} of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most Archaeopteryx specimens became embedded in anoxic sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea—the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, {{which suggests that the}} specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape (death pose) of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin <b>already</b> <b>was</b> softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.|$|E
5|$|The Brothers {{took part}} in the {{gauntlet}} match at Glory By Honor 2, which was held to fill the tag team championship left vacant by Red suffering a serious knee injury. They defeated and eliminated the Special K team of Hydro and Angeldust as well as The Ring Crew Express, before being eliminated by the other Special K team in the match, Izzy and Dixie, due to outside interference from Angeldust. After Izzy and Dixie later won the tag team title, the Brothers were granted a shot at it, at Main Event Spectacles. The reason given in the storyline was they were given the shot since they only lost in the gauntlet match because Special K cheated. In the opening segment of that event, they were aligned with Jim Cornette, because, in the storyline, Cornette wanted to create new champions. They attacked his former client, Samoa Joe, who Cornette abandoned since he <b>already</b> <b>was</b> a champion. They {{went on to win the}} belts later in the show. At The Conclusion, The Battle Lines Are Drawn, and The Last Stand, which was by stipulation Joe's last shot at the tag team title for as long as the Briscoe Brothers held it, they retained the belts over Joe and a different partner each time, A.J. Styles, Bryan Danielson, and Jerry Lynn respectively. Since Joe took pinfalls at The Conclusion (to Mark) and The Last Stand (to Jay), both brothers subsequently earned shots at his world title. Both fell; Mark at Final Battle 2003 and Jay at At Our Best in a memorable and bloody steel cage match.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. {{increased}} its economic control of Honduras, while the country fell further into debt.

25|$|Other historians dispute {{this claim}} of British influence, {{pointing}} {{out that there is}} no documentary evidence for it. They note that, although the British economy and commercial interests benefited from the war, the UK government opposed it from the start. It believed that war damaged international commerce, and disapproved of the secret clauses in the Treaty of the Triple Alliance. Britain <b>already</b> <b>was</b> increasing imports of Egyptian cotton and did not need Paraguayan products.|$|E

25|$|When {{design work}} had progressed {{far enough to}} allow it, Kawasaki built a {{full-scale}} mock-up of the Ki-88, which bore a strong resemblance to the P-39. After inspection of the mockup, the Japanese calculated a maximum speed for the aircraft of 600km/hr (373mph) {{at an altitude of}} 6,000 m (19,685 feet). This was only slightly faster than the Kawasaki Ki-61 Hien fighter, which <b>already</b> <b>was</b> in production. As a result, Kawasaki discontinued design work on the Ki-88 {{less than a year after}} beginning it.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s the Suez Crisis of 1956 caused dismay {{among the}} French right, which <b>already</b> <b>was</b> {{angry at the}} lack of American support during Dien Bien Phu in 1954.

Much later, the alleged weapons of mass {{destruction}} in Iraq affair certainly dirtied the previously favourable image. In 2008, 85% of the French people considered the American government and banks to be most liable for the Financial crisis of 2007–2010.|$|E

In the 1860s some of the Isleños fought in the American Civil War on the Confederate side. After the end of the war, there were food shortages throughout the South, including St. Bernard parish, and hunting became even more important to the Isleños, as it <b>already</b> <b>was</b> for the Cajuns around New Orleans.|$|E
