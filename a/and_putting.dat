5|$|In the 2006 Oklahoma State game McCoy {{threw for}} his 27th passing {{touchdown}} of the season, giving him sole {{possession of the}} single-season Texas record <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> him two touchdowns shy of the NCAA single season record for freshman quarterbacks (29). Coincidentally, this 27th pass was also for 27 yards.|$|E
5|$|Proposals in January 2013 {{to improve}} the bus service to the airport {{involving}} turning emergency lanes into bus lanes on the freeway and the Bolte Bridge <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> SkyBus on a myki fare, were challenged by CityLink operator Transurban, because it would limit its toll revenue, and by Melbourne Airport, because it would reduce its car parking profits. Similar objections would apply to a rail link.|$|E
5|$|Brachychiton rupestris {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a host plant for the mistletoe species Dendrophthoe glabrescens. Insects hosted by the species include the pale cotton stainer bug, a pest of cotton crops, and the kurrajong leaf roller caterpillar that chews on the foliage and rolls individual leaves, within which it then pupates. Bottle tree scrub is a key habitat of the near threatened black-breasted buttonquail. Brachychiton rupestris can withstand bushfires and responds by flowering <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> forth new foliage afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Double Dare 2000 {{introduced}} the Triple Dare Challenge. Available only in round two, this allowed {{a team to}} make their physical challenge more difficult, increasing its value by $100, <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> a bonus prize at stake. Difficulties included reducing the time limit, adding an extra item to the stunt, or increasing the overall difficulty of the stunt. The actual modifier was not revealed unless the team decided to accept the challenge. If the team did not complete the challenge successfully, the money, prize, and control went to their opponents.|$|E
5|$|Duyệt's death {{opened the}} way for Minh Mạng to apply his {{policies}} in the south, as the viceroy's subordinates lacked the influence to defy the court. The emperor also tried to reduce Duyệt's followers’ political power by abolishing the post of viceroy <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> the south under his direct rule, thus making Duyệt the last holder of the post. Soon after Duyệt's death, Minh Mạng's new appointees arrived and took over the local administration. The new officials then launched an investigation and reported that Duyệt and his aides had engaged in corrupt and abusive practices.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Molotov {{was sent}} to Ukraine {{to take part in}} the civil war then {{breaking}} out. Since he was not a military man, he took no part in the fighting. In 1920, he became secretary to the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Bolshevik Party. Lenin recalled him to Moscow in 1921, elevating him to full membership of the Central Committee and Orgburo, <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> him in charge of the party secretariat. He was voted in as a non-voting member of the Politburo in 1921, and held the office of Responsible Secretary and also married Soviet politician Polina Zhemchuzhina.|$|E

5|$|In late 1944 several British {{air attacks}} damaged the U-boat bases in Bergen. During {{one of these}} attacks, a 'Tallboy' bomb went {{straight}} through the roof of pen 3, damaging it beyond repair <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> it out of action {{for the remainder of}} the war. The base was handed over to the Allies, along with the rest of occupied Norway, on 8 May 1945 when all German forces in Europe surrendered. As a result of the intensive bombing of the city in late 1944 and 1945, the Bergen area was one of the worst damaged regions in the south of Norway at the conclusion of the war.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's death {{triggered}} a global outpouring of grief. The news spread quickly online, causing websites {{to slow down}} and crash from user overload, <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> unprecedented strain on services and websites including Google, AOL Instant Messenger, Twitter, and Wikipedia. Overall, web traffic ranged from 11% to at least 20% higher than normal. MTV and BET aired marathons of Jackson's music videos. Jackson specials aired on television stations around the world. MTV briefly returned to its original music video format, airing hours of Jackson's music videos, accompanied by live news specials featuring reactions from MTV personalities and other celebrities.|$|E

5|$|Losing {{power and}} speed, Roma {{began to fall}} out of the battle group. Around 16:02, another Fritz X slammed into the {{starboard}} side of Romas deck, between frames 123 and 136. It most likely detonated in the forward engine room, sparking flames, and causing heavy flooding in the magazines of main battery turret number two and the fore port side secondary battery turret, <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> even more pressure upon the previously stressed hull girder. Seconds after the initial blast, the number two 15-inch turret was blown over the side by a massive explosion, this time from the detonation of that turret's magazines.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the film}} took place in India over five months. Khan spent his first two days as director blocking the first scene to be filmed—Ishaan returning home from school <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> away his recently collected fish—and becoming comfortable with his new responsibilities. Believing that the audience should {{not be aware of}} the camera, he chose a simple shooting style {{for the film}} that involved relatively little camera movement.|$|E
5|$|The service {{modifications}} lowered operating expenses, but {{the coefficient}} of use went down dramatically: 0.33 for the first ten months of 1908. The decision to axe the line was made on 1 November 1908. Two strategic errors had been made: wanting a service independent of the CTR's network, <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> its terminus out of town. The railway was officially disbanded by a decree of 14 September 1911, the rails were lifted, the public highway restored; {{no trace of the}} tramway remains.|$|E

5|$|This {{prompted}} a {{transfer to a}} landing ground at Semallé, south-east of Alençon. As the unit was establishing itself here, they came under fresh attack from Mustangs, which shot up the airfield, destroying 15 Fw 190s <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> II./JG 1 out of the battle. Around 11 non-operational Fw 190s were also destroyed– resulting in the final losses of II./JG 1 in Normandy. In ten weeks in Normandy, II./JG 1 had lost 27 pilots, 3 captured and 2 wounded. A total of 106 aircraft were lost for various reasons.|$|E
5|$|Transfer {{speculation}} linked Kisnorbo to Wigan Athletic {{at the end}} of the 2005–06 season, but {{he decided}} to extend his stay with Leicester by signing a new three-year contract, less than 12 months after joining the club. Kisnorbo began the 2006–07 season well, scoring two goals <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> in fine rear-guard displays against Coventry City and Southend United, helping the club survive relegation yet again. He was linked with a move to Fulham during the January transfer window. His performance in the 2006–07 season earned him the players' player of the season award from his teammates. It was also at this point that he became a fan favourite.|$|E
5|$|Andrianampoinimerina dethroned Andrianjafy in {{a violent}} {{conflict}} that ended in 1787. The king then used Ambohimanga as a launching point for a successful campaign to bring the twelve sacred hills of Imerina under his rule, including the hill city of Antananarivo, thereby reuniting the four quadrants of the divided Kingdom of Imerina under his sovereignty <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> an end to 77 years of civil war. To consolidate support for his rule, Andrianampoinimerina mobilized representatives of the numerous noble castes {{to participate in the}} most extensive effort yet to expand and fortify Ambohimanga. He ordered the construction of new city walls, gates and defensive trenches, as well as a rosewood palace called Mahandrihono, which he had built in the traditional style.|$|E

5|$|As Dan travels across Gallowmere, {{fighting}} his {{way through}} Zarok's hordes and confronting all manners of beasts, he soon arrives at Zarok's lair, fighting off Zarok's skeletal warriors using the souls of his old allies retrieved by collecting the Chalices. After also managing to defeat Zarok's champion, Lord Kardok, Zarok turns into a powerful monster, but Dan manages to defeat him. As Zarok uses his last breath to cause his lair to collapse, Dan escapes and Zarok's magical influence over the land is thwarted, restoring the souls back to the living <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> the dead back to rest. With the magic cast on him also wearing off as a result, Dan returns to his burial chamber where he once again enters eternal slumber. If the player has managed to collect all the Chalices, Dan will ascend to the Hall of Heroes, where he is hailed as the rightful Hero of Gallowmere.|$|E
5|$|Beth Phoenix {{became the}} number one {{contender}} for the Women's Title after winning a Diva battle royal at SummerSlam. At the Unforgiven pay-per-view, however, Candice successfully retained her title in their match by countering one of Phoenix's moves with a crucifix pin. Their feud continued when Phoenix pinned Candice during a non-title mixed tag team match on Raw on September 24. At No Mercy on October 7, Candice dropped the title to Phoenix, ending her reign as Women's Champion. On October 22, Candice legitimately cracked her clavicle during her rematch for the Women's Title against Phoenix in a {{two out of three}} falls match; Phoenix ran into the ropes, causing Candice to fall face-first off of the turnbuckle onto her face, neck, and shoulders necessitating a rushed finish <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> her out of action for 14 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Brody {{runs into}} Mike, who tells {{his father that}} Sean is with his friends, {{drifting}} towards Cable Junction, a small island housing an electrical relay station, and apologizes for disobeying him <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> Sean in danger. Brody accepts his apology while telling him to get to safety and quickly finds them, but when the shark returns, he panics and maroons the police boat on Cable Junction. He then tries to pull them in with a winch but hooks an underwater power cable. The shark's next attack sends most of the teenagers into the water, and they swim to Cable Junction while Sean and Jackie are trapped on the boats. Using an inflatable raft, Brody hits the power cable with an oar to attract the shark, and encourages it to bite the cable; the shark is fatally electrocuted, and its body sinks {{to the bottom of}} the sea. The kids rejoice as Brody picks up Sean and Jackie, and they join them on Cable Junction to await rescue.|$|E
