5|$|In October 1942, Popovac {{issued an}} appeal to Muslim Partisans, urging them to join the Chetniks and turn against the Ustaše. In a report to Mihailović dated 3 November, Popovac wrote:I have to {{emphasize}} to you the intimate cooperation between the Muslims <b>and</b> <b>Orthodox</b> in the Stolac district from where, through the joint struggle of the Muslims <b>and</b> <b>Orthodox,</b> the Croat inhabitants, who were largely Ustaša-inclined, have been expelled. In that way, from Gabela to Mostar the entire left bank of the Neretva has been cleansed, {{and the number of}} refugees has been estimated at 12,000 people.|$|E

5|$|Catholic {{doctrine}} {{has developed}} over the centuries, reflecting direct teachings of early Christians, formal definitions of heretical <b>and</b> <b>orthodox</b> beliefs by ecumenical councils and in papal bulls, and theological debate by scholars. The Church believes that it is continually guided by the Holy Spirit as it discerns new theological issues and is protected infallibly from falling into doctrinal error when a firm decision on an issue is reached.|$|E

5|$|The Nazi {{occupation}} of Poland {{was among the}} most brutal of the war, resulting in death of more than 3 million ethnic Poles and about 3 million Polish Jews. The six million Jewish, Roman Catholic <b>and</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Poles represented nearly 17 percent of the country's population. Poles were one of Hitler's first extermination targets, as he outlined in an August 22, 1939 speech to Wehrmacht commanders before the invasion. Intelligentsia, socially prominent and influential people were primarily targeted, although ethnic Poles and other Slavic groups were also killed en masse. Hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholic <b>and</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Poles were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau and other concentration camps, and the intelligentsia were the first targets of the Einsatzgruppen death squads. The anti-Polish campaign culminated in the near-complete destruction of Warsaw, ordered by Hitler and Himmler in 1944. The original assumptions of Generalplan Ost were based on plans to exterminate around 85% (over 20 million) of ethnically Polish citizens of Poland, with the remaining 15% to be used as slaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{behaviour}} of the Crusaders appalled the Greeks and Muslims, {{creating a}} lasting barrier between the Latin world {{and both the}} Islamic <b>and</b> <b>Orthodox</b> religions. It was an obstacle to the reunification of the Christian church and created a perception of Westerners as defeated aggressors.|$|E

5|$|To sum up: The {{lines of}} {{cleavage}} between Pablo's revisionism <b>and</b> <b>orthodox</b> Trotskyism are {{so deep that}} no compromise is possible either politically or organizationally.

They are determined to drive all orthodox Trotskyists out of the Fourth International or to muzzle and handcuff them.|$|E

5|$|Although {{his four}} matches since the MCC fixture had yielded only six wickets at 34.16, Johnson was {{selected}} in the team for the First Test at Trent Bridge. McCool, the other spinner in the MCC and Worcestershire matches, had played in only one match since the MCC game, {{in which he was}} wicketless. McCool’s omission was the only change from those two matches. Bill Johnston, who bowled left arm pace <b>and</b> <b>orthodox</b> spin was included in the team at the last minute in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket, following the arrival of rain. Johnston had taken match figures of 10/40 and 11/117 against Yorkshire and Hampshire respectively, both on rain-affected wickets.|$|E
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2001, the Coptic <b>Orthodox</b> <b>and</b> Greek <b>Orthodox</b> Patriarchates of Alexandria agreed to {{mutually}} recognize baptisms performed in each other's churches, making re-baptisms unnecessary, and to recognize the sacrament of marriage as celebrated by the other. Previously, if a Coptic <b>Orthodox</b> <b>and</b> Greek <b>Orthodox</b> wanted to get married, the marriage had to be performed twice, once in each church, {{for it to be}} recognized by both. Now it can be done in only one church and be recognized by both.|$|R

5|$|Another {{genre of}} history writing {{produced}} during the Era of the Princes was the terse Ethiopian annal known as ya'alam tarik. These works attempted to list major world events {{from the time}} of the biblical Genesis until their present time in a universal history. For instance, the translated work of John of Nikiû explaining human history until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 642 became a canonical text in Ethiopian historiography. There are also chronological and genealogical lists of rulers <b>and</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Church patriarchs that include some elements of historical narrative.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} religion, Byzantine Greek Macedonia is also {{significant}} {{as being the}} home of Saints Cyril and Methodius, two Greek brothers from Thessaloniki (Salonika) who were sent on state-sponsored missions to proselytize among the Slavs of the Balkans and east-central Europe. This involved Cyril and Methodius having to translate the Christian Bible into the Slavs' own language, for which they invented an alphabet that became known as Old Church Slavonic. In the process, this cemented the Greek brothers' status as the pioneers of Slavic literature and those who first introduced Byzantine civilization <b>and</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Christianity to the hitherto illiterate and pagan Slavs.|$|E

5000|$|High Church Anglicanism {{tends to}} be closer than Low Church to Roman Catholic <b>and</b> Greek <b>Orthodox</b> Christian teachings. In contrast, the Evangelical wing of Anglicanism is closer to Protestant thinking. Although the conservatives tend to look favourably on Roman Catholicism <b>and</b> the <b>Orthodox</b> churches, some in the High Church {{tradition}} are sympathetic to practices that, according to both official Roman Catholic <b>and</b> Eastern <b>Orthodox</b> Christian teachings, are anathema, such as the ordination of women.|$|R

5|$|Korçë {{belongs to}} the region {{regarded}} as Northern Epirus, a region with substantial Albanian, Aromanian and Greek populations. The Greek national view was to classify all Aromanians <b>and</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Albanians {{as part of the}} Greek minority. The Great Powers signed the Protocol of Florence and awarded the region to the newly founded Principality of Albania on December 17, 1913. Gradual withdrawal of the Greek army would enable the Albanian forces {{to take control of the}} region. Consequently, to avert this possibility, pro-Greek Epirotes decided to declare their own separate political identity and self-governance.|$|E
5|$|Puerto Rico {{is home to}} {{the largest}} and wealthiest Jewish {{community}} in the Caribbean with almost 3,000 Jewish inhabitants.

Sha'are Zedeck, established in 1953, represents Conservative Judaism; Beth Shalom, established in 1967, represents Reform Judaism; and Chabad Center, established in 1997, represents Orthodox Judaism.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{were further}} damaged by a schism between the Catholic West <b>and</b> <b>Orthodox</b> East {{that led to}} the Byzantine Greeks being labeled as heretics in the West. Throughout the later centuries of the Byzantine Empire and {{particularly}} following the coronation of Charlemagne (reigned as king of the Franks 768–814) in Rome in 800, the Byzantines were not considered by Western Europeans as heirs of the Roman Empire, but rather as part of an Eastern kingdom made up of Greek peoples.|$|E
