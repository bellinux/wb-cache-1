500|$|As a broodmare, Chicado V {{gave birth}} to nine foals, or babies, between 1955 and 1968, seven stallions and two mares. Seven earned their Race Register of Merit with the AQHA. Four of her foals—Triple Chick, Three Chicks, The Ole Man, and Chicado Chick—were sired by Three Bars (TB), {{a member of the}} AQHA Hall of Fame. Her other five foals were sired by five {{different}} stallions, respectively War Bam, Spotted Bull, <b>Anchor</b> <b>Watch,</b> Double Bid, and fellow Hall of Famer Go Man Go. In a 1959 interview, Vessels felt that Chicado V was the best broodmare he owned. Vessels further stated that he [...] "wouldn't part with her" [...] and that he [...] "would be crazy to sell her".|$|E
60|$|Lister {{thought the}} man had slept, {{but it was not}} important, since there was no obvious {{necessity}} for keeping <b>anchor</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Near {{the mouth}} of the river two gunboats were anchored. They passed within a short {{distance}} of one of these, and a solitary sailor, keeping <b>anchor</b> <b>watch</b> on deck, remarked: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{day before}} they sighted Jungle Island and {{discovered}} the little land-locked harbour upon {{the bosom of}} which the Cowrie now rode quietly at <b>anchor,</b> the <b>watch</b> had discovered the smoke and funnels of a warship upon the southern horizon.|$|R
50|$|Sakshi Joshi is an Indian TV news {{journalist}} {{for past}} 12 years {{who is currently}} working as a primetime anchor cum special correspondent with BAG films Pvt Ltd (News24). She <b>anchors</b> much <b>watched</b> and a popular debate show called 5 Ki Panchayat where she is often praised for grilling the politicians with her hard hitting questions.|$|R
60|$|Sheldon {{was back}} in the {{plantation}} superintending the building of a bridge, when the schooner Malakula ran in close and dropped <b>anchor.</b> Joan <b>watched</b> the taking in of sail and the swinging out of the boat with a sailor's interest, and herself met the two men who came ashore. While one of the house-boys ran to fetch Sheldon, she had the visitors served with whisky and soda, and sat and talked with them.|$|R
6000|$|... “They’ve hove {{her short}} and found another fathom, and I expect they’re satisfied,” Jimmy said; “but they’ll keep good <b>anchor</b> <b>watch.</b> The {{best thing we}} can do is to lie down in the bottom.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] {{answered}} Acton, [...] "is what I don't quite understand. If he'd hailed <b>anchor</b> <b>watch</b> loud enough, George {{would have}} gone off for him. Still, we're lying quite a way out from the beach." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's off," [...] he said. [...] "Might have a {{high-power}} engine {{inside of}} him. Guess he's going to scare those schooner men 'most {{out of their}} lives. It's quite likely they won't keep <b>anchor</b> <b>watch</b> when they're lying snug {{in a place of}} this kind." ...|$|E
50|$|Watch straps may {{close with}} a buckle or a {{butterfly}} clasp. Expanding watchstraps are designed to expand elastically, often {{by the use of}} metal springs in a segmented design, and may be slipped on like a bracelet. Attachment points for the strap to the watch are largely standardized, with a spring-loaded double-ended pin used to <b>anchor</b> the <b>watch</b> strap to holes in a bracket that is integral to the watch case, allowing worn watch straps to be replaced or swapped with new straps for fashion purposes.|$|R
5000|$|After a short {{stint at}} CBS Morning News, Chase joined CNN in 1980 and stayed until 1986, {{serving as the}} first <b>anchor</b> of Media <b>Watch</b> in 1985. She co-authored several celebrity autobiographies, {{including}} books by Rosalind Russell, Betty Ford, and Alan King Name Dropping [...] She co-authored a biography of Josephine Baker with Baker's son, Jean-Claude Baker.|$|R
5000|$|Kgopedi Oa Namane Lilokoe is a South African radio {{personality}} from Tembisa. She is {{the former}} Midday News and Africa <b>Watch</b> <b>anchor</b> on South Africa’s largest commercial radio station, Metro FM. [...] She also hosted Africa Digest, a daily current affairs programme that runs from 5pm to 8pm, on Channel Africa Radio. In June 2016, she was announced as a host of the 12th Africa Movie Academy Awards.|$|R
60|$|Sail was got off her, {{and a man}} {{placed in}} the chains, and {{soundings}} taken. This was continued until the water shoaled to eight fathoms, when the brig was brought up, head to wind, and the anchor let go. Then an <b>anchor</b> <b>watch</b> of four men was set, {{and the rest of}} the crew allowed to turn in.|$|E
60|$|The skipper was on deck {{in a few}} minutes, {{but there}} was nothing to show what had become of the engineer. The Adelaide had, however, now swung with her stern {{somewhat}} near the shore, and a man who had kept <b>anchor</b> <b>watch</b> remembered having seen a big Siwash canoe slipping out to sea a few hours earlier.|$|E
6000|$|He {{concealed}} his astonishment. [...] "Very well, sir." [...] Outside the cuddy he put {{his head}} in the second mate's door to inform him of my unheard-of caprice to take a five hours' <b>anchor</b> <b>watch</b> on myself. I heard the other raise his voice incredulously--"What? The Captain himself?" [...] Then a few more murmurs, a door closed, then another. A few moments later I went on deck.|$|E
2500|$|Folklore has it that, {{leaving the}} area in disgrace, she ventured to the {{waterfront}} area in West Side Manhattan. It was while wandering the dockyards {{in the spring of}} 1869 that she witnessed members of the Charlton Street Gang unsuccessfully attempting to board a small sloop <b>anchored</b> in mid-river. <b>Watching</b> the men being driven back across the river by a handful of the ship's crew, she offered her services to the men and became the gang's leader. Within days, she engineered the successful hijacking of a larger sloop [...] and, with [...] "the Jolly Roger flying from the masthead", she and her crew reputedly sailed up and down the Hudson and Harlem Rivers raiding small villages, robbing farm houses and riverside mansions, and occasionally kidnapping men, woman and children for ransom. She was said to have made several male prisoners [...] "walk the plank".|$|R
5000|$|Ultimately, {{the ship}} {{proceeded}} to Reykjavík, Iceland, {{where she would}} encounter the most severe weather she would see in her career. One particular day, 15 January 1942, was memorable. She set her special sea, <b>anchor</b> and steaming <b>watches</b> and put out both anchors with 120 fathoms (219 m) of chain on the starboard and 60 fathoms (110 m) to port, with her main engines turning over and steam up on all boilers. The winds were clocked at 71 kn, with occasional gusts of 95, forcing the tender to drag anchor. The gale lasted until 19 January, and caused heavy damage among the ship's patrol planes. The ship nearly collided with the heavy cruiser [...] on one occasion, and {{was in danger of}} fouling several other ships during that time. Her starboard anchor was fouled once, and she lost the port anchor. She ultimately left Reykjavík on 19 January, steaming initially at greatly reduced speed because of the tempest, shaping course for Argentia, where she would embark passengers for transportation to Norfolk.|$|R
60|$|I {{detained}} {{him as he}} {{was making}} a move. For the last two days the crew had had plenty of hard work, and the night before they had very little sleep. I felt painfully that I--a stranger--was doing something unusual when I directed him to let all hands turn in without setting an <b>anchor</b> <b>watch.</b> I proposed to keep on deck myself till one o'clock or thereabouts. I would get the second mate to relieve me at that hour.|$|E
6000|$|The sailor laughed, {{as if he}} understood. [...] "A queer country; I've {{been here}} before! Beautiful, bits of it; shining surf, yellow sands, and palms, but it plays some funny tricks with white men. About half {{of them at the}} {{factories}} get addled brains if they stay long. Believe in things the bushmen believe, ghosts and magic, and such. Perhaps it's the climate, but on this coast you get fancies you get nowhere else. I'd sooner take look-out on the fo'cas'le in a North Sea gale than keep <b>anchor</b> <b>watch</b> in an African calm." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{men were}} divided into two watches, but all were told that, with the {{exception}} of two stationed as an <b>anchor</b> <b>watch,</b> they could turn in till tide turned. Frank threw himself at once into the bunk which had been allotted to him. He had not closed an eye the night before, and was worn out by emotion and fatigue, and scarcely had he lain down than he was sound asleep. He had been placed in the starboard watch, and slept till he was roughly shaken at four o'clock in the morning.|$|E
6000|$|... “‘Everything is quiet,’ {{the mate}} said, ‘and has been ever since you turned in. Even {{that is not}} natural, for, as you know, the natives when {{they have been doing}} a trade {{generally}} keep on feasting and making a row half the night. Keep your ears well open, for there is no trusting the watch. Every time I have gone forward I have found them sound asleep. Naturally they think that, as there is only an <b>anchor</b> <b>watch,</b> there can be no fear of disturbance; so you must trust to your own ears and not to theirs.’ ...|$|E
60|$|Two {{hours later}} the crew, having got into dry clothes, were sitting down, enjoying a {{plentiful}} allowance of pea soup and salt junk; while {{the officers were}} partaking of similar fare, in the cabin. None who saw them there would have dreamt of the long struggle they had been through, and that the ship was well nigh a wreck. It was now late in the afternoon, and Fairclough gave orders that all might turn in, {{as soon as they}} liked; except that an <b>anchor</b> <b>watch,</b> of four men, must maintain a sharp lookout, for the natives of the island were bitterly hostile to the whites.|$|E
60|$|The {{task was}} not difficult. The {{lightness}} of the wind, and {{uncertainty about the}} currents proving {{the only source of}} embarrassment, I succeeded in finding the passage, after a short trial; and sending the boat ahead, under Talcott, as an additional precaution, soon had the Crisis floating in the very centre of this natural dock. Sail was shortened as we came in, and the ship made a flying moor; after which we lay as securely, at if actually in some basin wrought by art. It is my opinion, the vessel would have ridden out the hardest gale, or anything short of a hurricane, at single anchor, in that place. The sense of security was now so strong upon us, that we rolled up our canvass, set an <b>anchor</b> <b>watch</b> of only one man, and turned in.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, my men," [...] he said. [...] "I {{see that}} you are all aware of what has taken place. It is most disgraceful and unfortunate, and I need hardly say that I am as much vexed as yourselves at losing the Cup, which, but for that, we must have carried off. However, {{it is one of}} those cases in which there is nothing to be done, and we should only make things worse by making a fuss about it. We have no ground {{whatever}} for believing that it was the work of one of the Phantom's crew, and it is far more likely that it was the work of some longshore loafer who had laid more than he could afford against us. It has partly been our own fault, but we shall know better in future, and your captain will take good care that there shall be an <b>anchor</b> <b>watch</b> set for two or three nights before we sail another race.|$|E
6000|$|The {{riding light}} in the forerigging burned with a clear, untroubled, as if symbolic, flame, {{confident}} and bright in the mysterious shades of the night. Passing on my way aft along {{the other side of}} the ship, I observed that the rope side ladder, put over, no doubt, for the master of the tug when he came to fetch away our letters, had not been hauled in as it should have been. I became annoyed at this, for exactitude in some small matters is the very soul of discipline. Then I reflected that I had myself peremptorily dismissed my officers from duty, and by my own act had prevented the <b>anchor</b> <b>watch</b> being formally set and things properly attended to. I asked myself whether it was wise ever to interfere with the established routine of duties even from the kindest of motives. My action might have made me appear eccentric. Goodness only knew how that absurdly whiskered mate would [...] "account" [...] for my conduct, and what the whole ship thought of that informality of their new captain. I was vexed with myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have it," [...] she announced. [...] "Lend me {{a gang of}} your {{boys for}} to-day. I'll build a grass house for myself over {{in the far corner}} of the compound--on piles, of course. I can move in to-night. I'll be {{comfortable}} and safe. The Tahitians can keep an <b>anchor</b> <b>watch</b> just as aboard ship. And then I'll study cocoanut planting. In return, I'll run the kitchen end of your household and give you some decent food to eat. And finally, I won't listen to any of your protests. I know all that you are going to say and offer--your giving the bungalow up to me and building a grass house for yourself. And I won't have it. You may as well consider everything settled. On the other hand, if you don't agree, I will go across the river, beyond your jurisdiction, and build a village for myself and my sailors, whom I shall send in the whale-boat to Guvutu for provisions. And now I want you to teach me billiards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “‘I don’t like it,’ {{the mate}} said to me; ‘those fellows were too friendly. They did not bargain over the goods, but took them {{at our own}} terms, which is not their way. I believe they did it just to lull us into a sense of security. As soon as the skipper turns {{in for the night}} I will get the guns quietly loaded, and you and I will keep watch, while I will order the crew to turn in all standing, so as to be ready to tumble out at once. It is mighty hard to keep awake on these soft nights when the anchor is down, and with neither you nor I on deck the betting is two to one that the hands on <b>anchor</b> <b>watch</b> will drop off to sleep. The skipper will be snoring by ten o’clock, and you had better turn in now. I will see to getting the guns loaded, and to having plenty of {{ammunition}} handy. I will call you at four bells. If {{we are going to be}} attacked it is likely to be just as day is breaking.’ ...|$|E
60|$|The fog held all day {{and grew}} thicker when {{darkness}} fell; but the red dawn brought a clearer air with signs of a change, and Jimmy steered shoreward, sweeping the beach with his glasses {{as they approached the}} channel through the sands. That end of the island was free of ice, and after consulting together they decided to enter the bight. They thought they would be safer there, and they wanted to feel that the voyage was finished and they were ready to get to work. During the afternoon it began to blow strongly off the shore. The sloop lay in smooth water close to the beach, but when night fell the surf was roaring on the sands and they could hear the crash of rending ice. At times the din was awe-striking, but it died away again, and although they kept <b>anchor</b> <b>watch</b> in turns no floe appeared to trouble them. At dawn the greater part of the ice had gone, and they could see white patches shining far out at sea, but it was blowing much too hard for them to think of leaving shelter.|$|E
50|$|At sea an AB watchstander's duties include {{standing}} {{watch as}} helmsman and lookout. A helmsman {{is required to}} maintain a steady course, properly execute all rudder orders and communicate utilizing navigational terms relating to heading and steering. A watchstander may {{be called upon to}} stand security-related watches, such as a gangway watch or <b>anchor</b> <b>watch</b> while the ship is not underway.|$|E
50|$|SS Park Victory sank in the Gulf of Finland near Utö on Christmas Night, about 02.15 AM {{local time}} (UTC+2), December 25, 1947 after accidentally running aground on rocks in a storm. The rock opened {{a hole in}} the engine room and a boiler {{explosion}} followed. The ship sank just off of the Utö Lighthouse. The Master of the ship, Allen Zepp, initially lost his license when a Coast Guard examiner said that Zepp failed to maintain an adequate <b>anchor</b> <b>watch.</b> The decision was overturned on appeal.|$|E
50|$|Since her {{fires were}} out, no power could be raised, and so her <b>anchor</b> <b>watch</b> manned the pumps and a tug {{took her in}} tow. The wash from the tug {{increased}} the flooding and Waterwitch sank in 24 ft of water. At low water, her masts, funnel, and the highest parts of her superstructure remained above water. Two members of her ship's company were drowned: Marine Sturgess knocked himself out diving overboard and was drowned, and an unnamed Chinese boy drowned between decks. A Board of Trade inquiry was held at Singapore from 20 to 23 September 1912.|$|E
