We ﬁnd that <b>arbitrators</b> who also represent brokerage ﬁrms or brokers in other arbitrations award signiﬁcantly less compensation to investor-claimants than do other <b>arbitrators.</b> We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant effect for attorney-arbitrators who represent investors or both investors and brokerage ﬁrms. The relation between representing brokerage ﬁrms and arbitration awards remains signiﬁcant even when we control for political outlook. <b>Arbitrators</b> who donate money to Democratic political candidates award greater compensation than do <b>arbitrators</b> who donate to Republican can-didates. We also study the dynamics of panel interaction. We ﬁnd that the position of chair {{is an important factor}} in assessing an <b>arbitrator’s</b> inﬂuence, although the ﬁnancial relationships of other <b>arbitrators</b> may also affect arbitration awards. Coalitions with the other <b>arbitrators</b> are also important. If the chair and another panelist possess a common attribute, the effect on the arbitration award increases...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, the {{inhabitants}} of the new French territory did not recognize the authority of the treaties imposed upon them. For this reason, rice farmers in Carabane experienced lootings and abductions by the Karoninka people. Troops led by Émile Pinet-Laprade attacked the Karoninka villages in March 1860, forcing them to submission. A period of calm ensued. While the Mandinka Muslims continued, illegally, to practice slavery and trade, non-Muslim villages tended to come together, accepting the Resident of Carabane as the <b>arbitrator</b> of their disagreements.|$|E
5|$|On August 27, Falcons owner Arthur Blank {{said at a}} {{press conference}} that the Falcons would seek to recover a portion of Vick's signing bonus. He said the team had no {{immediate}} plans to cut ties with Vick, citing salary-cap issues. It initially appeared that Goodell had cleared the way for the Falcons to release Vick, since he ruled that Vick's involvement in gambling activity breached his contract. On August 29, the Falcons sent a letter to Vick demanding that he reimburse them for $20 million of his $37 million bonus. The case was sent to arbitration, and on October 10, an <b>arbitrator</b> ruled that Vick had to reimburse the Falcons for $19.97 million. The <b>arbitrator</b> agreed with the Falcons' contention that Vick knew he was engaging in illegal activity when he signed his new contract in 2004, and that he had used the bonus money to pay for the operation.|$|E

The NHL appointed Larry Bertuzzi, a lawyer from Toronto, as the <b>arbitrator</b> of the conflict.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence that}} the variance of arbitrated wage settlements is systematically lower than the variance of wage settlements negotiated without arbitration using a panel of contracts between teachers and school boards in the Canadian province of British Columbia. This finding is interpreted as evidence that <b>arbitrators</b> coordinate their decisions. However, coordination on a rule leaves <b>arbitrators</b> as a group vulnerable to manipulation by coalitions of employers or employees that understand the rule. Because successful manipulation of <b>arbitrators</b> undermines {{the credibility of the}} institution, <b>arbitrators</b> as a group have incentives to change their rules from time to time. Evidence is presented that in BC, school boards were more successful than teachers at manipulating <b>arbitrators,</b> and that <b>arbitrators</b> responded by changing their rule. ...|$|R

5|$|O'Neal {{played in}} two more games before the NBA's case was {{brought before the}} U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York on December 30. The NBA argued that {{under the terms of}} the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), Stern had {{absolute}} authority to hand out suspensions and hear appeals for all on-court incidents. But the judge ruled that because O'Neal's behavior was an off-court incident, arbitration was allowed under the CBA, and thus the <b>arbitrator</b> was within his rights to reduce the suspension. Despite O'Neal's successful appeal, no further appeals were made to reduce Artest's and Jackson's suspensions.|$|E

5|$|A delegation, {{consisting}} of {{the representatives of the}} twelve important clans of Medina, invited Muhammad to serve as chief <b>arbitrator</b> for the entire community; due to his status as a neutral outsider. There was fighting in Yathrib: primarily the dispute involved its Arab and Jewish inhabitants, and was estimated to have lasted for around a hundred years before 620. The recurring slaughters and disagreements over the resulting claims, especially after the Battle of Bu'ath in which all clans were involved, made it obvious to them that the tribal concept of blood-feud and {{an eye for an eye}} were no longer workable unless there was one man with authority to adjudicate in disputed cases. The delegation from Medina pledged themselves and their fellow-citizens to accept Muhammad into their community and physically protect him as one of themselves.|$|E

Flournoy authored a report allowing for the distribution of funds to Keller's heirs and beneficiaries from Charleston National Bank. In December 1932, Flournoy provided mediation for several business and home owners who sued the city of Charleston over the widening of Virginia Street between Summers and Capitol Streets.

It {{was the first time in}} NBA history that games were canceled due to a labor dispute. On October 20, <b>arbitrator</b> John Feerick ruled that the owners did not have to pay players with guaranteed contracts during the lockout. Feerick's decision gave the owners leverage in bargaining talks.

40|$|<b>Arbitrators</b> are lead {{actors in}} global dispute {{resolution}}. They are to global dispute resolution what judges are to domestic dispute resolution.

This Article {{is the first to}} use original experimental research to explore how international <b>arbitrators</b> decide cases.

We also find evidence that casts doubt on the conventional wisdom that <b>arbitrators</b> render “split the baby” decisions. Although direct comparisons are difficult, we find that <b>arbitrators</b> generally perform at least as well as, but never demonstrably worse than, national judges analyzed in earlier research. There may be reasons to prefer judges to international <b>arbitrators,</b> but the quality of judgment and decision making, at least as measured in these experimental studies, is not one of them. Thus, normative debates about global dispute resolution should focus on using structural safeguards and legal protections to enhance quality decision-making, regardless of decision maker identity or title...|$|R
