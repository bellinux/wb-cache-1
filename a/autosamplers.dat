50|$|Many <b>autosamplers</b> {{are sold}} as {{optional}} {{parts of the}} analytical setup, and make up for {{a substantial portion of}} its total cost. It is noteworthy that <b>autosamplers</b> for different devices work in a very similar way and could easily be adopted by different machines. However, this is uncommon as manufacturers often restrict the compatibility of accessories to their analytical setup.|$|E

50|$|<b>Autosamplers</b> enable {{substantial}} {{gains in}} productivity, {{precision and accuracy}} in many analytical scenarios, and therefore are widely employed in laboratories.|$|E
50|$|<b>Autosamplers</b> {{normally}} {{consist of}} a robotic device that can either bring the sample to a sampling station, or bring a sampling device to the sample that stays on a tray (or carousel) along with other samples.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>autosamplers</b> {{for liquids}} {{consist of a}} {{carousel}} and the sampling apparatus. The carousel holds the samples, and revolves around its center so that samples change their horizontal position. There may be several concentric rings holding samples in a carousel. The sampling apparatus can be fixed horizontally, only {{moving up and down}} to allow the carousel to move, or it can also move horizontally, depending on the design of the system. The sampling apparatus in most of such <b>autosamplers</b> consist of a needle connected to a remote pumping syringe via tubing. Similar designs have been employed for titrators, which do not have a sampling apparatus, but a titration apparatus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Autosamplers</b> for gases can be {{as simple}} as a pump that {{continuously}} sucks air or any gas mixture inside the analytical device, or be the same as the one used for liquids, but with a gas-tight syringe.|$|E
50|$|<b>Autosamplers</b> {{for liquids}} work along {{many kinds of}} {{machines}} that perform different kinds of chemical measurements, like titrators, gas chromatographers, liquid chromatographers, water analyzers (like total carbon analyzers, dissolved inorganic carbon analyzers, nutrient analyzers) and many others.|$|E

50|$|Laboratory {{processes}} are suited for robotic automation as the {{processes are}} composed of repetitive movements (e.g. pick/place, liquid & solid additions, heating/cooling, mixing, shaking, testing).

5000|$|The {{most widely}} known {{application}} of laboratory automation technology is laboratory robotics.

50|$|<b>Autosamplers</b> {{for solids}} {{are used in}} {{conjunction}} with elemental analyzers. Common models consist of a carousel that holds the samples that are commonly wrapped in metal (usually tin or silver) foil.

50|$|The {{high cost}} of many {{laboratory}} robots has inhibited their adoption. However, currently there are many robotic devices that have very low cost, and these could be employed to do some jobs in a laboratory. For example, a low-cost robotic arm was employed to perform several different kinds of water analysis, without loss of performance compared to much more expensive <b>autosamplers.</b> Alternatively, the autosampler of a device {{can be used with}} another device, thus avoiding the need for purchasing a different autosampler or hiring a technician for doing the job. The key aspects to achieve low-cost in laboratory robotics are 1) the use of low-cost robots, which become more and more common, and 2) the use of scripting, which enables compatibility between robots and other analytical equipment.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} method {{is the use}} of {{analytical}} nebulizers. Nebulizer converts liquids into an aerosol, and that aerosol can then be swept into the plasma to create the ions. Nebulizers work best with simple liquid samples (i.e. solutions). However, there have been instances of their use with more complex materials like a slurry. Many varieties of nebulizers have been coupled to ICP-MS, including pneumatic, cross-flow, Babington, ultrasonic, and desolvating types. The aerosol generated is often treated to limit it to only smallest droplets, commonly by means of a Peltier cooled double pass or cyclonic spray chamber. Use of <b>autosamplers</b> makes this easier and faster, especially for routine work and large numbers of samples. A Desolvating Nebuliser (DSN) may also be used; this uses a long heated capillary, coated with a fluoropolymer membrane, to remove most of the solvent and reduce the load on the plasma. Matrix removal introduction systems are sometimes used for samples, such as seawater, where the species of interest are at trace levels, and are surrounded by much more abundant contaminants.|$|E
40|$|<b>Autosamplers</b> are {{ubiquitous}} {{tools in}} laboratories, and {{an integral part}} of many analytical instruments. However, most <b>autosamplers</b> are expensive, and as such they are not used in all laboratories. One option is to purchase an analytical instrument without its autosampler, and integrate an autosampler from another supplier. Using scripting, it is possible to couple any autosampler with any analytical instrument, as long as both have a graphical user interface (GUI). Here we show {{that it is possible to}} integrate an inexpensive robotic arm kit, which has a GUI, to any analytical device that also has a GUI. The coupling is simple and does not require any electronic knowledge. We demonstrated that the robotic arm worked as an autosampler with 3 different analytical instruments for 8 different chemical measurements: total alkalinity, pH, total carbon, total organic carbon (including isotopic composition), total inorganic carbon (including isotopic composition) and total nitrogen in water samples. The setup is an economical alternative to the common liquid <b>autosamplers...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Regulatory {{agencies}} approve automatic samplers containing peristaltic pumps as {{a sample}} collection method for stormwater character-ization and for treatment-device evaluation. Autosampler performance, {{as discussed in}} the limited available literature, can vary across the entire particle size range typically found in stormwater from different source areas and outfalls—reasonably consistent performance for particle sizes, 250 lm, but much less consistency for particles. 250 lm. Therefore, a series of experiments was undertaken to quantify the upper range of consistent particle capture that may occur with sampling stormwater suspended sediment and particulate-bound pollutants. These experiments, based on triplicate sampling at each experimental condition, found that peristaltic pump <b>autosamplers</b> commonly used in stormwater monitoring could not repeatedly and effectively capture particles. 250 lm from a simulated stormwater whose particles have a specific gravity of 2. 65. It was expected that the effective size for <b>autosamplers</b> would be correspondingly larger for particles having smaller specific gravities. The height of the sampler had no influence on particle recovery up to a height of 2. 5 m, with slightly decreasing recoveries of large particles occurring at greater heights, {{as a result of}} reduced sampler intake velocity. Therefore, to characterize the solids across the entire size range and specific gravities that may occur in stormwater runoff, <b>autosamplers</b> should be deployed in conjunction with bedload and floatables sampling.

40|$|Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) {{has long}} been used for {{metabolite}} profiling {{of a wide range}} of biological samples. Many derivatisation protocols are already available and among these, trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatisation is one of the most widely used in metabolomics. However, most TMS methods rely on off-line derivatisation prior to GC-MS analysis. In the case of manual off-line TMS derivatisation, the derivative created is unstable, so reduction in recoveries occurs over time. Thus, derivatisation is carried out in small batches. Here, we present a fully automated TMS derivatisation protocol using robotic <b>autosamplers</b> and we also evaluate a commercial software, Maestro available from Gerstel GmbH. Because of automation, there was no waiting time of derivatised samples on the <b>autosamplers,</b> thus reducing degradation of unstable metabolites. Moreover, this method allowed us to overlap samples and improved throughputs. We compared data obtained from both manual and automated TMS methods performed on three different matrices, including standard mix, wine, and plasma samples. The automated TMS method showed better reproducibility and higher peak intensity for most of the identified metabolites than the manual derivatisation method. We also validated the automated method using 114 quality control plasma samples. Additionally, we showed that this online method was highly reproducible for most of the metabolites detected and identified (RSD < 20) and specifically achieved excellent results for sugars, sugar alcohols, and some organic acids. To the very best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the automated TMS method has been applied to analyse a large number of complex plasma samples. Furthermore, we found that this method was highly applicable for routine metabolite profiling (both targeted and untargeted) in any metabolomics laboratory...|$|E

40|$|Automatic {{samplers}} are {{a common}} {{method of data collection}} for numerous monitoring projects in the South Florida region and elsewhere. Although total phosphorus (TP) is the primary parameter of interest within this region, nitrogen species such as ammonia nitrogen (NH 4 -N), nitrate+nitrite nitrogen (NOx-N), and total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) are also collected and analyzed. Federal and state quality assurance guidelines require nutrient samples to be preserved by acidification with H 2 SO 4 to a pH< 2 and stored immediately at 4 °C. However, the remoteness of many sampling locations in South Florida makes it difficult to supply electricity for the refrigeration of samples collected by <b>autosamplers.</b> In addition, the use of propane-powered refrigerated <b>autosamplers</b> is a costly and ineffective solution in the South Florida climate. Consequently, while samples collected at these remote locations are routinely pre-preserved with acid, they are not cooled to 4 °C for a period from one to seven days. This study evaluated if a statistically significant difference (α=. 05) existed between concentrations of nitrogen species from a common source sample that was either: processed immediately; refrigerated to 4 °C for seven days; or not refrigerated for seven days. In all cases, the collected sample was pre-preserved by adding 1 ml of 50 % H 2 SO 4 to each 1 -liter discrete sample container before each 7 day testing period. Differences in concentrations of the calculated parameter total nitrogen (TN) were also investigated. Analyses using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test showed no significant differences among the three treatment groups for NOx-N, TKN, TN and TP. Significant differences were observed when the NH 4 -N samples that were processed immediately were paired with NH 4 -N samples that were left unrefrigerated or refrigerated for seven days. Information from this study can be used by researchers and managers in evaluating the usefulness of nutrient water quality data that is collected when sample refrigeration is not available...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Nutrient loading in {{semi-arid}} streams during flood {{events may}} result primarily from soil flushing and transient bank storage. To test this hypothesis, eight soil lysimeters and two stream <b>autosamplers</b> were placed along a 500 m {{reach of the}} San Pedro River, Arizona, in summer 2001, alongside 45 piezometers we installed last spring. Flood samples were collected once to twice hourly, and soil water samples were collected {{within a few days}} after a flood. Samples were analyzed for conservative chemical tracers and dissolved nutrients. Nitrate concentrations were elevated (- 5 - 6 mglL) in some soil water samples from adjacent banks that became saturated during flood events; nitrate concentrations in baseflow and groundwater were often below detection (< 0. 01 mg/L). A simple mixing model indicated that soil water was flushed from the banks prior to and during peak flow, an occurrence that may be associated with elevated stream nitrate concentrations. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations exhibited a delayed response, but increased by- 3 mglL shortly after peak flow. These results corroborate that soil flushing may be a significant contributor of nutrients during floods, but the role of post-flood bank drainage may not be as important to the overall nutrient balance.
