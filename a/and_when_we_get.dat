500|$|When {{asked about}} the new project, drummer Rob Bourdon said, [...] "We tend to be perfectionists and it's sort of how we work. We {{like being in the}} studio <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> in there we write a ton of material." [...] Bourdon said the album was a {{challenge}} to complete; he said, [...] "We've been making music for a long time so one of the challenges was to evolve and make something to keep us interested and also {{have a lot of fun}} in the process. We've been used to making a certain type of music and using sounds to accomplish that. So to break out of that and push ourselves to grow is definitely challenging." [...] Shinoda later said the album was not a concept record, saying, [...] "People asked us if it's a concept record, and in the middle of the process, we were contemplating whether or not that was what we wanted to do," [...] although he said that eventually, A Thousand Suns at its completion has no narrative and is [...] "more abstract" [...] than many concept albums.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't be womanish and over-cur'ous, Mulford. I sail with sealed orders, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> well to {{windward}} of Jamaica, 't {{will be time}} enough to open them." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But our {{luck was}} out. We lost many days in finding these islands, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> did <b>get</b> back to them, hardly had {{we got on}} board than the weather broke up.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must say}} I rather hate {{to leave you}} fellows," [...] {{declared}} the little cadet. [...] "You've treated me very nicely--much better than I was treated by Bill <b>and</b> Gabe. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> back to Colby Hall I won't forget it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I wouldn't {{cry about}} it," [...] said Harry. [...] "There's nothing to shoot now; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> rich I {{can buy it}} back again, or get another." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{here we are}} at Reading. There is the {{carriage}} waiting, and away we are off home; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> home, and have seen everybody and everything, we will look over our section once more.|$|E
6000|$|... "To-morrow I'll go to Torquay and {{get some}} money, and get you some clothes that won't be noticed, and then we'll steal away. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to London, soon perhaps, if you love me well enough, we'll be married." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Jennie," [...] said Rollo, {{in a low}} tone, [...] "I {{think we}} had better follow this party, and keep close to them all the time, <b>and</b> then, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to the church, perhaps they {{will give us a}} seat." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{young man}} here, is {{modestly}} brooding behind a damp apron pendent from a clothes-line. As I glance at him I become--but I don't know why--vaguely reminded of Woolwich, Chatham, Portsmouth, <b>and</b> Dover. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> out, my respected fellow-constable Sharpeye, addressing Mr. Superintendent, says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I dono. But robbers {{always have}} orgies, {{and of course}} we've got to have them, too. Come along, Huck, we've been in here a long time. It's getting late, I reckon. I'm hungry, too. We'll eat <b>and</b> smoke <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to the skiff." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Won't that be jolly? I {{wish it was}} all done. Then, {{directly}} it's done, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to New York, we'll telegraph {{and write}} to papa, and we'll be ever so penitent and good; won't we? Of course he'll {{make the best of}} it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you see I {{can engage}} a {{carriage}} {{to take us}} there myself," [...] said Rollo. [...] "I shall say 'Pompeii!' to the coachman, and point that way. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to Pompeii, we shall find uncle George there, and then we shall get along well enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Leland, drily, [...] "it {{will save}} us some trouble. You're {{not going to}} walk very far like that, <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> the fire under control, we'll see {{what can be done}} for you. It's your own fault that you'll have to wait a little." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, that's settled," [...] said Harold, {{with a look}} of satisfaction; [...] "I {{have already}} {{arranged}} with our agent here to advance me what I require in the way of funds, and shall hire men <b>and</b> canoes <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> down to the Zambesi--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Me don't like it, incos. Me {{tell you}} what we do. We keep over to left, <b>and</b> then <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> just through the bush we fire our guns. Then the Kaffirs very much {{surprised}} and all run that way, and you ride straight through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gone down, I think. We saw him {{trying to}} swim, but the tide swept him up the gut, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were <b>getting</b> close he disappeared. We pulled round the spot, but saw nothing. No doubt, he'd have on his {{oilskins}} and sea-boots." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{prevents}} your marrying him?' {{asked the}} eldest, 'you {{would become a}} gardener too; it is a charming profession. You could live in a cottage {{at the end of}} the park, and help your husband to draw up water from the well, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> up you could bring us our bouquets.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, child," [...] said she, soothingly; [...] "I won't {{attempt to}} deny you. Dry your eyes, {{put on your}} mantilla; <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> {{face to face with}} the doctor, try to look as old and ugly as you can, if you want to be let into the sick-room along with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, Adam," [...] I whispered, [...] "the {{time has}} come. Jerk me {{as little as}} possible; and if {{questions}} are asked, you are taking the cage to be mended, you understand? <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> there, see no one but the man or the woman who spoke to you at the gates." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Has he {{told you}} that you and Mariquita are to {{accompany}} the force so far on the road, <b>and</b> that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> beyond the disturbed district I am to carry you on with a small party to Buenos Ayres, while the main body pursues the savages?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well,' says I, 'maybe you've {{really got}} kleptopigia. <b>And</b> maybe <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> {{out of the}} pig belt you'll turn your mind to higher and more remunerative misconduct. Why you should want to stain your soul with such a distasteful, feeble-minded, perverted, roaring beast as that I can't understand.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, there's your raw material, and you won't {{have much}} trouble {{to bring the}} logs down, though you may find {{stopping}} them from plunging into the river a harder thing. However, you have some notion of what you're up against, and I'll show you the plans <b>and</b> specifications <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> out of the rain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} it over," [...] Harold replied, [...] "and have decided on making for the James River. We shall be there before morning and can no doubt find a boat. We can guide ourselves by the stars, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> into the woods {{the direction of the}} wind will be sufficient." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you worry, young man, they won't {{get away}} from me," [...] {{answered}} the sheriff. [...] "I {{used to be on}} the New York force before I moved out here, and I know that class of scoundrels. I know that old stone house, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> there we'll fix a plan to bag every one of 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After you’ve {{raised the}} alarm {{and failed to}} recover the body," [...] said the skipper, with relish, [...] "you’ll lock my door and put the key in your pocket. That would be the proper thing to do if I really did go overboard, you know, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to London I’ll just slip quietly ashore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] he said, [...] "is {{our little}} {{marriage}} ceremony under God's sky, {{and no other}} can be more binding. As soon as you, in the plentitude of your maiden power, will fix {{a day for the}} other one, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> can <b>get</b> that over, then we will begin our little journey together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because he isn't that breed, that's why," [...] {{answered}} Phil. [...] "He {{hates to}} see another fellow become popular. Dave, you take my advice <b>and</b> watch him, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> back to school." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can make}} it lively for you <b>and</b> your crowd <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> ashore," [...] said Harvey, with a vicious nod, murmuring vague threats about [...] "piracy," [...] at which Troop almost--not quite--smiled.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had some}} talk with my {{supporters}} {{last night and}} we agreed to strike when the Rio Negro's cargo arrives. We need the guns and money to pay my troops, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> them we will arrest the leading conspirators. This will start the revolution, but it will fail if my blow is struck before Galdar is ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{matter for}} that," [...] says Captain Manly, very sternly. [...] "Go to your cabin, as I bid you, {{and stay there}} till I tell you to come out again, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to New York I'll take pains to inform your step-father of how you have behaved. I'll have no such rioting as this aboard my ship." ...|$|E
6000|$|There are a {{great many}} {{different}} methods by which {{we can take a}} ride. When we are very young we are generally very well pleased with what most boys and girls call [...] "piggy-back" [...] riding, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> older we delight in horses and carriages, and some of us even take pleasure in the motion of railroad cars.|$|E
5000|$|Brad Arnold told Alternative Addiction that [...] "he and {{his band}} mates were likely to {{collaborate}} on a new project in the near future." [...] He then stated that the band was collaborating back and forth online. Brad says, [...] "We've all been writing and sharing files electronically, <b>and</b> so <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> together I think we're going {{to be ready to}} record right away, and evolve these songs into an album." ...|$|R
60|$|Where were we to go next? Into the far west, {{to see how}} all the {{way along}} the railroads the new rocks and soils lie above the older, <b>and</b> yet how, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> westward, the oldest rocks rise highest into the air.|$|R
3000|$|Then, for all t∈R, we {{have the}} fact that [...] t≤ t holds and the larger the value of t, the closer cosht <b>and</b> sinht. <b>When</b> t→+∞, <b>we</b> <b>get</b> [...] t= t. In addition, both cosht and sinht are nonnegative, {{monotone}} increasing functions for t≥ 0.|$|R
