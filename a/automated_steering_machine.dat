Position and orientation of the construction machine are determined by sensors and will be instantaneously compared with reference data of the road planning. Hydraulic cylinders of the machine will then be addressed {{in a way that}} the geometry determining part of the machine, as e. g. the blade of a grader, can establish the reference geometry of the layer to be incorporated. For this measuring and controlling procedure different sensors are being used which are located in many different places of the machine. It all happens while the machine is moving so that problems with the temporal synchronization of the sensors and the machine inertia must also be considered. 1...|$|R

40|$|Strip {{steering}} in a {{hot strip}} rolling operation is important to maintain smooth operation of the steel mill. <b>Automated</b> <b>steering</b> control can improve the capability and productivity of a rolling mill and has previously been performed using roll force measurements. Due to the non-linear relationship of roll force measurements with strip position this method requires a complex computational model of the plant. A direct measurement method, such as a vision system is therefore preferred. Environmental factors, predominantly cooling water, make a vision system difficult to implement due to strip edges being obscured.

40|$|Abstract. Semi-automatic parking {{system is}} a driver {{convenience}} system <b>automating</b> <b>steering</b> control required during parking operation. This paper proposes novel monocular-vision based target parking-slot recognition by recognizing parking-slot markings when driver designates a seed-point inside the target parking-slot with touch screen. Proposed method compensates the distortion of fisheye lens and constructs a bird’s eye view image using homography. Because adjacent vehicles are projected along the outward direction from camera in the bird’s eye view image, if marking line-segment distinguishing parking-slots from roadway and front-ends of marking linesegments dividing parking-slots are observed, proposed method successfully recognizes the target parking-slot marking. Directional intensity gradient, utilizing the width of marking line-segment and the direction of seed-point with respect to camera position as a prior knowledge, can detect marking linesegments irrespective of noise and illumination variation. Making efficient use {{of the structure of}} parking-slot markings in the bird’s eye view image, proposed method simply recognizes the target parking-slot marking. It is validated by experiments that proposed method can successfully recognize target parkingslot under various situations and illumination conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWithin {{the context}} of more and more {{autonomous}} vehicles, an automatic lateral control device (AS: Automatic Steering) was used to steer the vehicle along the road without drivers’ intervention. The device {{was not able to}} detect and avoid obstacles. The experiment aimed to analyse unexpected obstacle avoidance manoeuvres when lateral control was delegated to automation. It was hypothesized that drivers skirting behaviours and eye movement patterns would be modified with <b>automated</b> <b>steering</b> compared with a control situation without automation. Eighteen participants took part in a driving simulator study. Steering behaviours and eye movements were analysed during obstacle avoidance episodes. Compared with driving without automation, skirting around obstacles was found to be less effective when drivers had to return from automatic steering to manual control. Eye movements were modified in the presence of automatic steering, revealing further ahead visual scanning of the driving environment. Resuming manual control is not only a problem of action performance but is also related to the reorganisation of drivers’ visual strategies linked to drivers’ disengagement from the steering task. Assistance designers should pay particular attention to potential changes in drivers’ activity when carrying out development work on highly automated vehicles...|$|R

The difficulty is not within the task itself, but rather in the extremely small margin of allowable error given the human life at stake and the extremely large number of edge cases that have to be accounted for. In other words, we task these systems to expect the unexpected with near 100 % accuracy, which is a technical challenge for machine learning methods that to date have generally been better at memorizing the expected than predicting the unexpected.

In the southeastern USA {{one of the reasons}} farmers adopt GPS guidance, and specifically <b>automated</b> <b>steering</b> (auto-steer), is that it can theoretically result in large yield gains when used to plant and invert peanuts—one of the region’s most important crops. The goal of our study was to quantify the yield benefit of using real time kinematic (RTK) -based auto-steer to plant and invert peanuts under a variety of terrain conditions. Yield benefits result from reduced digging losses. The study was conducted for two consecutive years (2010 and 2011) on a private farm in Georgia, USA. When all data are grouped together, auto-steer outperformed conventional by 579 kg/ha in 2010 and 451 kg/ha in 2011. We also evaluated the performance of auto-steer under different curvature conditions using low, medium, and high curvature rows. The results showed that auto-steer outperformed conventional under all curvature by a minimum of 338 kg/ha.

The system has a series of properties which make the controller design far from straightforward: the process has only one input (the rudder angle) and two outputs (the heading and the roll angle); the transfer from rudder to roll is non-minimum-phase; because large and high-frequency rudder motions are necessary, the non-linearities of the <b>steering</b> <b>machine</b> cannot be disregarded; the disturbances caused by the waves vary considerably in amplitude and frequency spectrum.

Design/methodology/approach For a fast sizing and optimization, linear static Finite Elements Models are used to obtain inner loads of the structural components. The inner loads and the geometry are passed to a software, where a comprehensive set of analytical failure criteria is applied for the design of the structure.
