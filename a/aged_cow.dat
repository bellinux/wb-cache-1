40|$|To {{effectively}} {{record the}} variability {{that is a}} feature of beef cattle herds on arid rangelands, sustained periods of objective data collection are required. This has been infrequently achieved on pastoral properties in the Alice Springs district of the Northern Territory. In this thesis, historical data are analysed from three primary beef cattle projects with breeding herds north of Alice Springs. Each of these projects involved data and sample collections during a 4 - to 5 -year period. Publications from each project were reviewed to identify summaries on breeding herd performance and gaps in data analyses. Where gaps were identified and data were available, new summaries and analyses were undertaken. The results of those analyses enabled comparison with existing knowledge about beef cattle production on arid rangelands, and provided new information on reproductive performance, mortality, nutritional deficiencies, infestations and infections in continuously-mated herds of the Alice Springs district. Information on reproductive performance and mortality was provided for different age and gender groups respectively.

In the present study, we examined how aging affects oocyte mitochondrial biogenesis and degeneration in response to induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Cumulus oocyte complexes were harvested from the ovaries of young (21 ‒ 45 months) and aged (≥ 120 months) cows and treated for 2 hours with 10 μM carbonyl cyanide-m- chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), or a vehicle control, after which cumulus oocyte complexes were subjected to in vitro fertilization and culture. CCCP treatment reduced ATP content and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the oocytes of both young and <b>aged</b> <b>cows.</b> When CCCP-treated cumulus oocyte complexes were subsequently cultured for 19 hours and/or subjected to fertilization, high ROS levels in oocytes and a low rate of blastocyst development was observed in oocytes derived from <b>aged</b> <b>cows.</b> In addition, we observed differential responses in mitochondrial biogenesis to CCCP treatment between young and <b>aged</b> <b>cows.</b> CCCP treatment enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis concomitant with upregulation of SIRT 1 expression in oocytes of young, but not <b>aged,</b> <b>cows.</b> In conclusion, <b>aging</b> affects mitochondrial quality control and recuperation of oocytes following CCCP-induced mitochondrial dysfunction...|$|R

In total, 35, 732 records of 8, 458 Tabapuã animals which were born in the state of Bahia, Brazil, from 1975 to 2001, from 167 sires and 3, 707 dams, were used. Two birth seasons were tested as for the environment effect: the dry (D) and rainy (R) ones. The covariance components were obtained by a multiple-trait analysis using Bayesian inference, in which each trait was considered as being different in each season. Covariance components were estimated by software gibbs 2 f 90. As for W 240, the model was comprised of contemporary groups and cow age (in classes) as fixed effects; animal and maternal genetic additive, maternal permanent environmental and residual were considered as random effects. Concerning W 365 and W 450, the model included only the contemporary <b>aged</b> <b>cow</b> groups as fixed effects and the genetic additive and residual effects of the animal as the random ones. The GEI was assessed considering the genetic correlation, in which values below 0. 80 indicated the presence of GEI. Regarding W 365 and W 450, the GEI was found in both seasons.

The experiment lasted four months, January, February, March, and April. Nine animals were used and divided into three separate lots. Lot 1 consisted of two cows and a yearling steer; lot 2 consisted of two cows and a yearling steer. These two lots were as near alike as could be selected. Lot 3 consisted of a three year old bull, an <b>aged</b> <b>cow</b> and a yearling steer. The cows in lots 1 and 2 were bred before the trial begun, so as to ascertain whether there is anything in new process oil meal that would interfere with the health of cows {{during the period of}} gestation.

40|$|If {{the object}} of the game is to do what one enjoys while making {{outstanding}} margin, we in the cow business have enjoyed one of the greatest opportunities in decades. Even though drought has made it an unequal distribution, and disease and politics have added considerable confusion, turning grass and other feed stuffs into marketable calves has been good. We have had challenges to enhance value for specific markets with new technologies. We have seen our <b>aged</b> <b>cow</b> and bull markets influenced heavily by border issues as well as premium meat markets disrupted by embargos and restrictions. Feed price has begun to make a major sort of production systems. However “good” calves produced in economically viable systems have been highly profitable. We have been asked to discuss how we endeavor to create and capture value in beef calf production. In summary, we attempt to maximize revenue by creating measurable or perceived value to the grow out and finishing segments, while knowing what input costs produce the greatest margin potential and reducing those costs which are not contributors. We will try to share with you some of our thoughts in these areas, while openly admitting we are learning every year and have much to do to stay competitive with this dynamic industry.

40|$|Advanced {{maternal}} age {{has been}} shown to influence follicular and luteal dynamics in bovine ovary resulting in reduced fertility. The overall objective of the four studies presented in this thesis is to identify the maternal age-associated transcriptional changes in granulosa cells of the dominant follicles during follicle development. In the first study, mRNA expression levels of housekeeping genes were measured by real–time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in granulosa cells of dominant follicles and FSH-stimulated follicles to select and validate suitable reference genes for relative gene expression analyses during maternal and follicular aging. Stability of six reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, EIF 2 B 2, UBE 2 D 2, SF 3 A 1 and RNF 20) was analyzed using GeNorm, DeltaCT and NormFinder programs and comprehensive ranking order was determined based on these programs. Geometric mean of multiple genes (UBE 2 D 2, EIF 2 B 2, GAPDH and SF 3 A 1) was more appropriate reference control than individual genes for the comparison of relative gene expression among dominant and FSH-stimulated follicles during maternal and/or follicular aging studies. In the second study, maternal age-associated changes in the transcriptome of granulosa cells recovered at the time of selection of the dominant follicle from aged (n= 3) and young cows (n= 3) were determined by EmbryoGENE bovine oligo-microarrays (EMBV 3, Agilent Technology). The mRNA expression of five transcripts (CYP 19 A 1, PCNA, GJA 1, TPM 2, and VNN 1) was confirmed in a different set of granulosa cell samples by RT-qPCR to validate microarray data. A total of 169 genes/isoforms were differentially expressed (≥ 2 -fold-change; P ≤ 0. 05) in <b>aged</b> <b>cows</b> vs. young cows. These transcripts revealed inefficient 1) control of gonadotropins, and gonadotropin-induced changes in the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, 2) lipid metabolism and steroidogenesis 3) cell proliferation, cell cycle control and intercellular communication, and 4) higher oxidative stress responses in <b>aged</b> <b>cows</b> vs. young cows. In the third study, changes in the transcriptome of granulosa cells of the preovulatory follicle 24 h after LH treatment from aged (n= 3) and young (n= 3) were determined. A total of 1340 genes were expressed differentially (≥ 2 -fold change; P ≤ 0. 05) in <b>aged</b> <b>cows</b> vs. young cows. The mRNA expression of five transcripts (RGS 2, PTGS 2, TNFAIP 6, VNN 1, NR 5 A 2 and GADD 45 B) was confirmed in a different set of granulosa cell samples to validate microarray data. These transcripts were related to delayed 1) response to LH treatment 2) cellular differentiation and luteinization and 3) progesterone synthesis. Intra-follicle levels of progesterone were lower (P < 0. 05) in <b>aged</b> <b>cows</b> compared to young and mid-aged cows. The fourth study compared the aged-associated changes in the transcriptome of granulosa cells during follicle development from the time of dominant follicle selection to preovulatory stage (24 h after LH). In comparison to young <b>cows,</b> <b>aged</b> <b>cows</b> expressed fewer differentially expressed genes/isoforms (1206 vs. 2260, respectively) at ≥ 2 -fold-change (P ≤ 0. 05) in the granulosa cells of the preovulatory (24 h after LH treatment) vs. the dominant follicle at selection. These transcripts in <b>aged</b> <b>cows</b> were related to late and inefficient 1) organization of cytoskeleton and cytoplasm, 2) differentiation, 3) lipid and cholesterol metabolism, 4) proliferation and 5) higher response to oxidative stress and free radical scavenging in the preovulatory follicles vs. the dominant follicle at selection. In conclusion, maternal age-alters the gene expression of granulosa cells of the dominant follicles during follicle development and results in a compromised follicular environment...|$|R
40|$|Cancerous {{growth of}} the horn of cattle is common in India and Sumatra and causes serious {{economic}} loss [1, 31. More than 6000 cases were reported in northern India [3]. Ninety-three percent of the affected animals were work-ing bullocks, but not one case occurred in a bull. Another report [2] cited 1414 cases in 1 year among nearly {{one and a half}} million cattle in four districts of India (Bombay state). Three cases of malignant horn tumours in Indian bullocks responded to surgical intervention and hormonal therapy [6]. In an abattoir survey in West India squamous cell carcinoma occurred in 2064 bullocks among 122 800 examined carcasses [5]. Three cases of horn cancer were seen where this condition had not been recorded previously. A 7 -year-old cow (indigenous breed) was admitted to the Department of Surgery because of a broken horn. There was infected granulation tissue {{at the base of the}} horn which was removed surgically. Infection had spread to the frontal sinus where there was newly grown horn tissue with an offensive odour. A 5 -year-old native cow had a small piece of tumour at the junction of horn and skin. It was spongy and grey-white and had a rough, verrucous surface. An <b>aged</b> <b>cow</b> with a history of injury to one of its horns had recently grown horn at the base of the old infected horn. Surgical excision exposed a horn core tumour. Tissue sections showed the three growths to be typical ulcerated, haemorrhagic squamous cell carcinomas. Carcinoma of the horn core in cattle is a neoplasm of squamous cell type [6]. The cell of origin has not been determined, although it is claimed that the neoplasm arises from the mucous membrane of the horn core sinus, and then invades the horn core [4, 81. Trauma has long been suspected as being responsible for the development of horn core cancer, but this is doubtful [3]. Since none of these tumours are bilateral and none have occurred in bulls, some hormonal cause is suggested. Because the neoplasm is more common in work bullocks than in cows (which are not used for draught purposes) it is suggested that the constant friction of the yoke near the base of the horn may have some significance [7]...|$|E

Heat waves were defined for each weather station as a period of at least 3 consecutive days, from May 1 to September 30 (2002 - 2007), when the daily maximum temperature exceeded the 90 th percentile of the reference distribution (1971 - 2000). Summer days were classified as days in heat wave (HW) or not in heat wave (nHW). Days in HW were numbered to evaluate the relationship between mortality and length of the wave. Finally, the first 3 nHW days {{after the end of}} a heat wave were also considered to account for potential prolonged effects. The mortality risk was evaluated using a case-crossover design. A conditional logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratio and 95 % confidence interval for mortality recorded in HW compared with that recorded in nHW days pooled and stratified by duration of exposure, <b>age</b> of <b>cows,</b> and month of occurrence. Dairy cows mortality was greater during HW compared with nHW days. Furthermore, compared with nHW days, the risk of mortality continued to be higher during the 3 d after the end of HW. Mortality increased with the length of the HW. Considering deaths stratified by <b>age,</b> <b>cows</b> up to 28. mo were not affected by HW, whereas all the other age categories of older cows (29 - 60, 61 - 96, and > 96. mo) showed a greater mortality when exposed to HW. The risk of death during HW was higher in early summer months. In particular, the highest risk of mortality was observed during June HW. Present results strongly support the implementation of adaptation strategies which may limit heat stress-related impairment of animal welfare and economic losses in dairy cow farm during HW...|$|R
40|$|Forty eight cows of Holstein-Zebu crosses with {{at least}} one {{completed}} pregnancy were tested for antibodies to 20 disease agents. The testing was performed within one month (average two weeks) after calving when the IgG level constantly reaches its lowest value during the cows reproductive cycle. The results indicate that increasing levels of IgG against Leptospira interrogans serovar hardjo and Mycobacterium paratuberculosis may be associated with an increased calving interval. Increase in calving intervals could not be explained by <b>age</b> of <b>cows</b> or their genotypic characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 16 % of the 31 million head {{of cattle}} {{harvested}} in the United States in 2005 were <b>aged</b> <b>cows.</b> Cow meat {{is known to be}} tougher than meat from young steers and heifers, and it typically has a less desirable, darker color. It is generally assumed that cow meat needs to be ground or have some form of postmortem tenderization applied to be merchandized as a whole muscle product. The knuckle, top sirloin, and top blade muscles have been identified as muscles that potentially can be upgraded to medium-priced steaks. Most cow steaks are fabricated by food-service providers for their customers with different specifications for aging and post-mortem tenderization application. Aging, blade tenderization, and injection enhancement are commonly used on cow meat to increase tenderness. It is unknown if extended aging is needed in addition to the other two methods to improve tenderness. If shorter aging periods can be used without compromising an improvement in tenderness, then aging costs would be greatly reduced. Our objective was {{to determine the effects of}} days of aging on tenderness of cow steaks from the knuckle, top sirloin, and top blade that were blade tenderized and injected with an enhancement solution containing an enzyme tenderizer...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the productive and reproductive performance of primiparous zebu cows supplemented on Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu with supplements of low intake composed of different energy sources in the postpartum period. Sixty cow-calf pairs were divided into three treatments, a standard mineral salt supplement, a supplement based on ground corn and another containing protected fat, under the same conditions of pasture. The cows had an average initial age of 36 months and 295. 9 ± 20 kg of initial body weight. The evaluation period lasted from November 2006 to May 2007, the 24 days after delivery until weaning of calves to 192 days of <b>age.</b> <b>Cows</b> fed the supplement based on ground corn (351 g day- 1) and protected fat (357 g day- 1) showed a similar increase in body weight, which was higher in relation cows fed with the mineral mixture (179 g day- 1). Mineral mixture supplementation resulted in body condition score loss of cows between 80 and 136 days after calving. Cows fed energy supplements of low consumption produced more milk, weaned heavier calves and showed higher pregnancy rate than those fed only with the mineral mixture. The use of 3...|$|R
