40|$|Introduction. One of {{the main}} {{indicators}} characterizing mechanical circulatory support devices (artificial valve, implantable pumps, etc.) is trauma of blood cells. Therefore, while developing new pumps, {{one of the key}} studies in vitro is to evaluate blood hemolysis. For an objective hemolysis analysis of pump it is required to create a standardized methodology of hemolysis studies. The object of the study in this paper is implantable axial pump DON for two-step heart transplantation in children. The aim of study is to develop a standardized methodology of hemolysis studies of blood pumps and to conduct research of pediatric <b>axial</b> <b>pump</b> DON. Materials and methods. To conduct hemolysis research we created a mock circulatory system consisting of a reservoir placed in water bath maintaining a constant working fluid (blood) temperature, hydrodynamic resistance, connecting tubes, ports for blood sampling and pressure and flow measurement systems, and research pump. Test method is to estimate levels of free hemoglobin pHb obtained by blood samples during pump working in operating mode (for pediatric pump: blood flow 2. 5 l/min, pressure difference 80 mmHg). Using the data obtained the standardized indices of hemolysis NIH and MIH are calculated based on pHb values, hematocrit, total hemoglobin, blood flow and working pump time. Results. We developed and realized a standardized methodology of hemolysis research by which we evaluated hemolysis of pediatric <b>axial</b> <b>pump.</b> The results of hemolysis tests allowed us to optimize the design of DON. Obtained values of hemolysis of the latest version of pediatric pump DON- 3 have shown that they do conform to the requirements of minimum blood injury and it allows us to proceed to the next step of pediatric pump research – animal experiments.

Two models of the pump were tested. Model 1 is a pump with cylindrical bearings and elongated straightener, model 2 had ball bearings and modi fi ed design of impeller and straightener. Results. In the fi rst series (n = 12) the pump model 1 was tested. The duration of experiments was 4, 9 ± 5, 3 days, maximal duration was 16 days. The experiments were fi nalized due to intraoperation cardiac fi brillation (n = 3), uncrop- ped acute bleeding (n = 3), lowering of blood fl ow through the pump of 60 ± 15 % (n = 6) because of thrombo- sis of the pump (n = 5) and outlet line (n = 1), in 3 cases of 5, combined with mechanical wear of bearings. In the second series (n = 6) the pump model 2 was tested. In 4 experiments of 6 the duration was 74, 5 ± 29 days. One experiment was fi nalized due to intraoperation cardiac fi brillation. Another one experiment was fi nalized on 8 day as planned. In 5 experiments there was absence of either thrombosis or mechanical wear of bearings.   Morphological and histological examination of the kidneys, liver and lungs in the 5 experiments of second series did not reveal the presence of zones of ischemia or thromboembolia.

40|$|Abstract—Tip vortex {{cavitation}} {{is one of}} {{well known}} patterns of cavitation phenomenon which occurs in axial pumps. This pattern of cavitation occurs due to pressure difference between the pressure and suction sides of blades of an <b>axial</b> <b>pump.</b> Since the pressure in the pressure side of the blade {{is higher than the}} pressure in its suction side, thus a very small portion of liquid flow flows back from pressure side to the suction side. This fact is cause of tip vortex cavitation and gap cavitation that may occur in axial pumps. In this paper the results of our experimental investigation about movement of tip vortex cavitation along blade edge due to reduction of pump flow rate in an <b>axial</b> <b>pump</b> is reported. Results show that reduction of pump flow rate in conjunction with increasing of outlet pressure causes movement of tip vortex cavitation along blade edge towards the blade tip. Results also show that by approaching tip vortex cavitation to the blade tip, vortex tip pattern of cavitation replaces with a cavitation phenomenon on the blade tip. Furthermore by further reduction of pump flow rate and increasing of outlet pressure, an unstable cavitation phenomenon occurs between each blade leading edge and the next blade trailing edge...|$|E
