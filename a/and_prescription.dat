5|$|Orr {{has been}} known to be {{fiercely}} loyal to former Bruin personnel and teammates. When Derek Sanderson had alcohol <b>and</b> <b>prescription</b> drug-abuse problems and wound up penniless, Orr spent his own money to ensure that Sanderson successfully completed rehab. Decades later, Orr and Sanderson went into business together managing finances for hockey players. Orr also helped out Bruins trainer John (Frosty) Forristall, his roommate during his first years with the Bruins, who had just been fired from the Tampa Bay Lightning for alcoholism in 1994. Forristall's drinking put him on bad terms with his brother John, so he returned to Boston jobless and soon afterwards was diagnosed with brain cancer. Orr took Forristall into his home for a year until he {{died at the age of}} 51. Orr was a pallbearer at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|In February 2003, Love {{was banned}} from Virgin Airlines by founder Richard Branson after being arrested at Heathrow Airport for disrupting a flight. In October of that year, {{in the midst}} of what Love would later admit was a serious cocaine <b>and</b> <b>prescription</b> drug addiction, she was arrested in Los Angeles after {{breaking}} several windows of her producer and then-boyfriend James Barber's home, and was charged with being under the influence of a controlled substance; the ordeal resulted in her losing custody of her daughter. On March 18, 2004, Love was arrested in New York City for allegedly striking a 24-year-old male fan with a microphone stand at a concert at the Bowery Ballroom. Four days later, on March 22, Love called in multiple times to The Howard Stern Show, making various claims and speaking erratically; in broadcast conversations with Stern, she claimed that the incident with the fan had not occurred, and that actress Natasha Lyonne, who was at the concert, was told by the alleged victim that he had been paid $10,000 to file a false claim leading to Love's arrest. She pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in October 2004.|$|E

5000|$|Principle of {{normative}} reasoning. There is {{the principle}} of normative reasoning, {{which is used to}} produce evaluations <b>and</b> <b>prescriptions</b> (<b>and</b> justifications of evaluations <b>and</b> <b>prescriptions).</b> Evaluations are statements of the form, [...] "X is good." [...] Prescriptions are statements of the form, [...] "Person A ought to do X." [...] Justification is a set of reasons organized into an argument which verifies, validates and vindicates evaluations and/or <b>prescriptions.</b> Evaluations <b>and</b> <b>prescriptions</b> are judged to be true when they are consistent with a set of norms to which all persons can rationally adhere if they were in the same set of circumstances.|$|R

25|$|Drug abuse, {{including}} alcohol <b>and</b> <b>prescription</b> drugs, can induce symptomatology which resembles mental illness. This {{can occur}} {{both in the}} intoxicated state and also during the withdrawal state. In some cases these substance induced psychiatric disorders can persist long after detoxification, such as prolonged psychosis or depression after amphetamine or cocaine abuse. A protracted withdrawal syndrome can also occur with symptoms persisting for months after cessation of use. Benzodiazepines are the most notable drug for inducing prolonged withdrawal effects with symptoms sometimes persisting for years after cessation of use. Abuse of hallucinogens can trigger delusional and other psychotic phenomena long after cessation of use.|$|E

Of particular interest {{in the study was}} the fact that these food proscriptions <b>and</b> <b>prescriptions</b> form an integral part of traditional medical procedures in that relapses or slow rate of recovery are sometimes attributed to a break of these food norms. Moreover, these proscriptions <b>and</b> <b>prescriptions</b> reflect: 1. (i) the healers' concept of the various childhood diseases and 2. (ii) the healers' belief in the respect for the traditional Yoruba gods in health matters.
