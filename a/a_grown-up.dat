25|$|Meston {{relished the}} upending of {{cherished}} Western fiction clichés {{and felt that}} few Westerns gave any inkling of how brutal the Old West was in reality.

Yonke did praise Talbot for her [...] "impressive vocal skills", but considered her [...] "earnestness [...] wasted on arrangements that sound as if they were ripped from a 1930s Shirley Temple songbook".

Using the morphs, Nergal is draining people of their lifeforce, called [...] "quintessence", to gain magical power. The Black Fang engage Eliwood's interest by capturing his father Lord Elbert. The protagonists' ultimate goal is to prevent Nergal from using their companions Ninian's and Nils' quintessence to open the Dragons' Gate, a portal where dragons reside, and thus ignite Elibe in conflict. As Eliwood and the party hunt the Black Fang down, they eliminate crucial figures of the Black Fang, as well as gaining allies and protecting Bern's royal prince Zephiel (a younger version of the main antagonist from The Binding Blade). The game ends when Eliwood and the party slay Nergal and the dragon that had been summoned via Nergal's quintessence. Eliwood becomes marquess of Pherae, and Hector inherits his brother's title as marquess of Ostia. A secret ending shows an older Eliwood and Hector introducing their respective children Roy and Lilina to each other, while <b>a</b> <b>grown-up</b> Zephiel, now the king of Bern, is being confronted by a robed man who accuses him of awakening the Demon Dragon.|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of the season, Duchovny asked Carter [...] "wouldn't it be great if we had like an alien bounty hunter?" [...] Carter was positive towards the idea and acted upon it, creating with Spotniz the character of the Alien Bounty Hunter for the two-part episodes [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "End Game". Actor Brian Thompson auditioned for the role in a casting session, where he was competing with another actor. Spotnitz and Carter did not have much time to cast the character, but they knew this casting would be important since they intended the character to become a recurring character. Thompson was chosen according to Spotnitz because he had a very [...] "distinctive look" [...] about him, most notably his face and mouth.

Kathryn McGuire of Rolling Stone described Usher's vocals as [...] "velvety" [...] and further wrote that [...] "Amid all the playboy pouting and preening, Usher's vocals are impressively adaptable [...] McGuire noted the album's primary fault is that [...] "Usher never surrenders his meticulously groomed veneer", with every track being formulaic, or [...] "radio-safe".|$|E
