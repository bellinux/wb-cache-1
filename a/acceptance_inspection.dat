The group was reduced to three squadrons on 12 April 1946 as both the 822nd and 823rd BS were inactivated and the 89th Bomb Squadron at Itazuke was assigned to the group.|$|R

2500|$|During the transisiton from F-100 to A-7D {{training}} in 1978, the squadron became a checkout and modification organization for new A-7D aircraft being produced by LTV. [...] These new aircraft were produced {{due to a}} Congressional mandate to maintain the A-7D production line in Dallas, and the new aircraft were flown to Tucson for <b>acceptance</b> <b>inspection.</b> [...] Upon receipt of the aircraft, the aircraft would be fully inspected and all discrepancies noted and repaired, being brought up to ANG standards.

[...] Between 1978 and 1980 a total of 24 new A-7D aircraft were received, of which the squadron increased in size from 12 to a total of 24 aircraft. Because the unit was a training school, its aircraft were flown much heavily than other ANG squadrons which were also more demanding and stressful on the airframes. In order to keep the maximum number of aircraft fully operational, many aircraft were transferred to Tucson from other squadrons and the training aircraft in Tucson were sent to other units to insure all aircraft did not have excessive hours or stress on them.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDue {{to their}} high {{lightweight}} potential, fibre reinforced plastics {{have found a}} broad application in chemical apparatus and plantconstruction. Because of improved standards for safety, reliability and cost effectiveness of such composite components, numerous technical challenges arise for the producers of pressure vessels, tanks, reactors and pipe element systems. In this context, a multitude of problems appear during recurring <b>acceptance</b> <b>inspections</b> and equipment condition monitoring using non-destructive test methods. Promising advantages arise from novel monitoring concepts based on semi-active or even absolutely autarkic wireless sensor networks with so-called “sleeping sensors” as key function units with remote enquiry. These autonomoussensor-based monitoring modules are directly integrated into the composite and start recording signals not before a defined threshold is increased. This article discusses the scientific-technical issues that arise during the development of such intelligent damage monitoring systems. This includes the sensor network design, the sensor integration during manufacturing and {{the correlation between the}} relevant damage mechanisms and the sensor signals. Exemplary, sensor networks are integrated in GFPR composites. These composites have been tested in order to demonstrate the modes of operation of the sensor techniques and theircapability to detect the relevant damage mechanisms...|$|R

At {{the start of the}} year, DesRon 2 consisted of six guided missile destroyers, three frigates, three Spruance (DD-963)-class destroyers and Dupont (DD-941). A reorganization of the Atlantic Fleet Destroyer squadrons on 4 April gave DesRon 2 an administrative disparate complement of 16 ships, a number lessened by one with the decommissioning of Mitscher (DDG-35) on 1 June. By year's end, the squadron included: guided missile destroyers John King (DDG-3), Lawrence (DDG-4), Claude V. Ricketts (DLG-5), Barney (DDG-6), Conyngham (DDG-17), Richard E. Byrd, Farragut (DDG-37), Coontz (DDG-40), King (DDG-41), Dahlgren (DDG-43), the frigates McCloy (FF-1038) and Glover (AGFF-1), destroyers Dupont and Blandy (DD-943) and guided missile frigate Richard L. Page (FFG-5). ComDesRon 2 provided support for the ships under his administrative control as immediate unit commander, and served as chief inspector for nuclear weapons <b>acceptance</b> <b>inspections,</b> Navy technical proficiency inspections, embarked in various ships to observe operational propulsion plant inspections, visited assigned ships undergoing overhauls in remote locations to monitor progress of the work, and carried out at-sea operational readiness inspections of various units.|$|R
5000|$|In June 1982, ComDesRon 2 Anti-Air Warfare Tactics Board was {{established}} {{to serve as a}} forum for tactical dialogue.

Focusing on three areas, these training initiatives sent undesignated seamen and firemen to Class [...] "A" [...] schools on returnable quotas, transferred Second Class Petty Officers and those of higher rank for temporary additional duty with Fleet Training Group at Guantanamo Bay for four to six weeks, and cross-decked E-5's and above to ships undergoing refresher training. The training program met with encouraging results. [...] Continuing its training efforts over the next three years, ComDesRon 2 served as Chief Inspector for Nuclear Weapons <b>Acceptance</b> <b>Inspections,</b> Navy Technical Proficiency Inspections, Type Commander 3M and Supply Management Inspections, and increased the number of Command Inspections it conducted overall. ComDesRon 2 retained its role as CINTEX Coordinator for the Norfolk waterfront.

However, the International Code Council, the most commonly adopted national standard for building codes in the US, adopts the recommended frequency of Appendix N in its entirety.

This thesis research {{focused on the}} identification and characterization of the barriers which impede institutionalization of Total Quality Management (TQM) concepts in the Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition system. Barriers were identified and characterized by survey {{of public and private}} sector individuals knowledgeable about TQM and experienced in the DoD acquisition system. The quality philosophy described by DR. W. Edwards Deming was the primary foundation for analysis. Although many barriers were identified, the research analyzed the top six barriers identified by respondents. In order of precedence, they were: Management Willingness to Change, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, Congressional Oversight, DoD <b>Acceptance</b> and <b>Inspection</b> Procedures, Single Year Budgeting, and Management Mobility. Major conclusions were: (1) Institutionalization of TQM involves a cultural shift in how managers view leadership, (2) Barriers rooted in statute or regulation demand leadership's attention, (3) A prerequisite for command positions must include a profound understanding of total quality, (4) The political environment that influences the DoD acquisition system, also affects DoD's ability to institutionalize total quality, (5) Enhancement of Government customer and contractor supplier long term relationships is required if total quality is to be institutionalized within DoD.
