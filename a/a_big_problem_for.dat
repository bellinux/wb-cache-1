In the Partisan territorial structure, the military-political region of Bosanska Krajina included central Bosnia. At the Skender Vakuf conference, presided over by Pucar, Stojanović and Karabegović, the participants analysed the military and political situation in the region. The increase of Chetnik influencewhich was strongest in southeastern Bosanska Krajina and northwest central Bosnia in the zones of responsibility of the 3rd and 4th Krajina Detachmentswas <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> the KPJ. A number of Partisans of these detachments joined the Chetnik side. Only in Kozara had Chetnik influence been held at bay. At the conference, Stojanović was appointed to lead a unified command of Partisan forces in Bosanska Krajina, but on 24February he was replaced with Kosta Nađ. The unified command was named the Operational Headquarters for Bosanska Krajina, and Stojanović became its chief of staff and deputy commander.|$|E

2500|$|In 1905, McClung {{refereed}} {{only two}} games, {{one of which}} turned out to be the biggest in his career. The first game of the season was between Harvard and Pennsylvania, which McClung officiated alongside [...] "Big Bill" [...] Edwards. The pairing was troublesome, since both men had previously served almost always as a referee, which left the position of umpire unfilled. Edwards eventually accepted the umpire role, and remained at the position for the rest of his officiating career following the game. The Harvard-Yale game was the most controversial game of McClung's career, although most of the issue surrounded Dashiell's umpiring. Late in the game, the teams were tied 0-0. Yale punted the ball to Francis Burr, Harvard's guard, who called a fair catch. However, Burr was hit by two Yale players and fumbled the ball, which set up Yale's winning score. Harvard fans and players believed that Burr had called the fair catch, while Yale claimed he never had and both officials agreed with Yale. After the game, McClung said that [...] " [...] looked ugly, but was within the rules of the game". The officials' decision remained <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> college football for some time, and eventually then-president Theodore Roosevelt met with Dashiell to discuss the play. Their reputations as good officials were significantly hurt by the game and Harvard would not allow them to again referee in a game involving their team. Following the season's conclusion, McClung joined other prominent football personnel in selecting that year's All-America team. McClung's selection included seven players who were later recognized as consensus All-Americans, and one of which, Tom Shevlin, would later make the Hall of Fame. McClung refereed the final game of his career in 1906, when, alongside William Herbert Corbin, he officiated the Army–Navy Game. Navy, coached by Paul Dashiell, won the contest 10-0.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} changes in HIV {{prevalence}} and incidence between 1996 and 2006 in urban areas of Bissau. Design: A cross-sectional survey of 384 randomly selected houses within a community-based follow-up study of HIV- 1 and HIV- 2. Methods: A total of 3242 individuals aged at least 15 years were eligible for inclusion. Participants were interviewed about behavioral and socio-economic factors and had a blood sample drawn. A total of 2548 individuals were tested for antibodies to HIV- 1 and HIV- 2, of whom 649 had taken part in a similar survey in 1996. Results: With 0. 5 % HIV dual reactions included, the overall HIV- 1 prevalence was 4. 6 % (118 out of 2548) and the HIV- 2 prevalence was 4. 4 % (112 out of 2548). The prevalence of HIV- 1 increased more for women than men especially in the 25 - 34 -year age group. HIV- 2 prevalence decreased below 45 years of age but not for individuals more than 45 years old. The incidence rate between 1996 and 2006 was 0. 5 per 100 person-years for HIV- 1 and 0. 24 per 100 person-years for HIV- 2. Compared with a previous period from 1987 to 1996, the incidence of HIV- 2 is declining whereas no {{significant increase in the}} incidence of HIV- 1 was observed. Conclusions: The present study shows an increasing prevalence of HIV- 1 and a decreasing prevalence of HIV- 2 in Guinea-Bissau. HIV is generally <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> women. Despite the general decline in prevalence, HIV- 2 may continue as an infection in older people, especially women...|$|R
40|$|The {{settlement}} of mass torts through the class action device presents some difficult and troubling issues, including important questions of due process, fairness, justice, efficiency, equality, equity, and ethics. In this context, {{some of these}} foundational values conflict {{with each other and}} must be 2 ̆ 2 resolved 2 ̆ 2 by judges who must decide actual cases. In analyzing the applicable laws and rules (class action rules, constitutional provisions, and ethics rules) we find answers or suggestions that are often ambiguous or contradictory. All of these unresolved ambiguities raise the question of whether mass torts are any different from any number of difficult cases our legal system faces. I do think that mass torts present us with some novel issues that question the transsubstantivity of our laws and rules. While others in this symposium focus on the procedural and substantive issues raised by such cases, I will focus on the ethics of such settlements in two senses: First, at the level of professional ethics, I will examine what is ethically permissible behavior {{in the way in which}} such settlements are arranged. Second, at the higher, broader level of ethics, I will examine the nature of an 2 ̆ 2 ethically 2 ̆ 2 just or fair settlement.

40|$|Global {{anthropogenic}} CO 2 rise {{is currently}} creating new environments and niches for microalgae {{living in the}} coastal and open oceans. These microalgae harness carbon concentrating mechanims (CCM) {{as a means of}} increasing their dissolved inorganic carbon uptake to overcome inherent problems that the enzyme RubisCO possesses. With algal blooms apparently becoming more frequent in the oceans, the possible harmful effects that they can cause are becoming <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> the local environment and populace. In this thesis brief summaries of the following three subjects are given: global CO 2 rise and its most direct implications for algae (CO 2 concentration and pH decrease); the reasons as to why algae use carbon concentrating mechanisms and its probable energetic costs, and finally algal bloom characteristics, specifically bloom onset, pH effects and ecological impacts. While these three themes are inherently more complex it is predicted that CO 2 rise will impact the bloom species at several levels. Algae like Emiliana huxleyi will suffer from the pH decrease, however at present times it still is a dominating blooming species due to other characteristics, like a highly regulated CCM-system, high growth rate and recycling of HCO 3 -. All else being equal in time it will probably be the algae with a strongly regulated or possibly no CCM, who posses a better RubisCO enzyme than other algae, who draw the longest straw due to decreased energetic costs. Research on these algae has only just started. However, CO 2 rise will not be solely responsible for dramatic species shifts in algal blooms due to aforementioned complexity of these described subjects. To gain insight in the interactions within and between the three subjects, studies should combine both focus on large scale experiments and on the molecular level. ...|$|R
