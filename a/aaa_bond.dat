40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of liquidity, default and {{personal}} taxes on the relative yields of Treasuries and municipals using a generalized model with liquidity risk. The municipal yield model includes liquidity as a state factor. Using a unique transaction dataset, we estimate the liquidity risk of municipals and its effect on bond yields. Empirical evidence shows that municipal bond yields are strongly affected by all three factors. The effects of default and liquidity risk on municipal yields increase with maturity and credit risk. Liquidity premium accounts for about 9 - 13 % of municipal yields for <b>AAA</b> <b>bonds,</b> 9 - 15 % for AA/A bonds and 8 - 19 % for BBB bonds. A substantial portion of the maturity spread between long- and short-maturity municipal bonds is attributed to the liquidity premium. Ignoring the liquidity risk effect thus results in a severe underestimation of municipal bond yields. Conditional on the effects of default and liquidity risk, we obtain implicit tax rates very close to the statutory tax rates of high-income individuals and institutional investors. Furthermore, these implicit income tax rates are quite stable across bonds of different maturities. Results show that including liquidity risk in the municipal bond pricing model helps explain the muni puzzle. ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there is}} a broad {{literature}} on structural credit risk models, {{there has been little}} empirical testing of these models. In this paper we examine the term structure of credit spreads on euro corporate bonds and the empirical validation of structural credit risk models. The latter provide a framework to analyze the main determinents of credit spreads. Using a dataset of 1577 investment grade corporate and 250 <b>AAA</b> rated government <b>bonds,</b> we first estimate the term structure of credit spreads for di. erent (sub) rating categories with an extension of the Nelson-Siegel method. Within each rating category, credit spreads on plus rated bonds have significantly higher credit spreads than minus rated bonds. According to the structural models, the results indicate that credit spread changes are significantly negatively correlated with changes in the level and the slope of the default-free term structure. While changes in the slope a. ect all rating categories, changes in the level are more important for higher rated <b>bonds</b> (<b>AAA</b> and AA). The stock return and the implied volatility of the stock price seem to significantly influence credit spread changes. The lower the rating category and the longer the maturity of the bond the stronger both e. ects. For BBB rated bonds, changes in liquidity -measured as the bid-ask spread- significantly influence credit spread changes. Higher rated <b>bonds</b> (<b>AAA</b> and AA) are also driven by past credit spread changes. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{relation}} between US stock prices, as exemplified by the S&P 500 stock index, and the change in eleven foreign exchange rates against the US dollar. The null hypothesis of no-cointegration fails to be rejected for all dual specifications. Granger-causality tests on the log returns reveals no effect of the exchange rates on stock prices, but there is Granger causality of US stock prices upon three foreign exchange rates. The model developed requires the inclusion in the regressions of the change in the cost of equity. The latter is substituted for by the baa or the <b>aaa</b> corporate <b>bond</b> yield. All regressions are estimated with a GARCH(1, 1) model of the conditional variance. The regressions of stock log returns on the log returns of each foreign exchange rate uncover significant impacts for five different rates. However when the ‘fundamental variable’ is added to the regressions, which is the change in the cost of equity, replaced by the change in the baa corporate bond yield, the above impacts reduce to only one with an additional impact that is marginally significant. If the change in the <b>aaa</b> corporate <b>bond</b> yield replaces the change in the cost of equity two significant impacts out of the eleven are found, with one additional marginal result. The evidence is therefore rather strong that the US stock market and the US dollar are effectively independent of each other once fundamentals are accounted for...|$|R

40|$|As U. S. Treasury {{securities}} {{carry the}} full faith and credit of the U. S. government, {{they are free}} of default risk. Thus, their yields are risk-free rates of return, which allows the most recently issued U. S. Treasury securities {{to be used as}} a benchmark to price other fixed-income instruments. This article analyzes the time series properties of interest rates on U. S. Treasury benchmarks and related debt instruments by modelling the conditional mean and conditional volatility for weekly yields on 12 Treasury Bills and other debt instruments for the period January 8, 1982 to August 20, 2004. The conditional correlations between all pairs of debt instruments are also calculated. These estimates are of interest as they enable an assessment of the implications of modelling conditional volatility on forecasting performance. The estimated conditional correlation coefficients indicate whether there is specialization, diversification, or independence in the debt instrument shocks. Constant conditional correlation estimates of the standardized shocks indicate that the shocks to the first differences in the debt instrument yields are generally high and always positively correlated. In general, the primary purpose in holding a portfolio of Treasury Bills and other debt instruments should be to specialize on instruments that provide the largest returns. Tests for Stochastic Dominance are generally consistent with these findings, but find somewhat surprising rankings between debt instruments, with implications for portfolio composition. Thirty year treasuries, <b>Aaa</b> <b>bonds,</b> and mortgages tend to dominate the other instruments, at least to the second order.

40|$|This paper conducts an {{in-depth}} analysis of structured finance asset-backed securities collateralized debt obligations (SF ABS CDOs), the subset of CDOs that {{traded on the}} ABS CDO desks at the major investment banks and were {{a major contributor to}} the global financial panic of August 2007. Despite their importance, we have yet to determine the exact size and composition of the SF ABS CDO market or get a good sense of the write-downs these CDOs will generate. In this paper the authors identify these SF ABS CDOs with data from Intex©, the source data and valuation software for the universe of publicly traded ABS/MBS securities and SF ABS CDOs. They estimate that 727 publicly traded SF ABS CDOs were issued between 1999 and 2007, totaling $ 641 billion. Once identified, they describe how and why multisector structured finance CDOs became subprime CDOs, and show why they were so susceptible to catastrophic losses. The authors then track the flows of subprime bonds into CDOs to document the enormous cross-referencing of subprime securities into CDOs. They calculate that $ 201 billion of the underlying collateral of these CDOs was referenced by synthetic credit default swaps (CDSs) and show how some 5, 500 BBB-rated subprime bonds were placed or referenced into these CDOs some 37, 000 times, transforming $ 64 billion of BBB subprime bonds into $ 140 billion of CDO assets. For the valuation exercise, the authors estimate that total write-downs on SF ABS CDOs will be $ 420 billion, 65 percent of original issuance balance, with over 70 percent of these losses having already been incurred. They then extend the work of Barnett-Hart (2009) to analyze the determinants of expected losses on the deals and <b>AAA</b> <b>bonds</b> and examine the performance of the dealers, collateral managers, and rating agencies. Finally, the authors discuss the implications of their findings for the “subprime CDO crisis” and discuss the many areas for future work.

Using cointegration analysis and error correction models, the paper shows that during the crisis lower market and funding liquidity are important drivers of the increase in the credit spread of the AAA-rated structured product, whilst they are less significant in explaining credit spread changes for a portfolio of unstructured credit instruments. Looking at the experience of the subprime crisis, the study shows that when the conditions under which securitisation can work properly (liquidity, transparency and tradability) suddenly disappear, investors are left highly exposed to systemic risk...|$|R
