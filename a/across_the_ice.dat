5|$|After the Cournoyer goal, {{the goal}} judge refused {{to put the}} goal light on {{despite the fact that}} it was signalled a goal on the ice. In response, Alan Eagleson (seated <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> from the Team Canada bench) {{attempted}} to reach the timer's bench to protest, causing a ruckus in the crowd as he made his way to the timer's bench. As he was being subdued by the Soviet police, the Canadian players headed over and Peter Mahovlich jumped over the boards to confront police with his stick. Eagleson was freed and the coaches escorted him <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> to the bench. In anger, he shoved his fist to the Soviet crowd, as a few other Canadian supporters also gave the finger to the Soviets. The Soviets continued to play defensively. Sinden speculates the Soviets were willing to accept the tie and win the series on goal differential.|$|E
5|$|In February 1793, the French Republic {{declared}} war on the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, drawing both into the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars. Less than two years later, {{in the winter of}} 17941795, the Dutch Republic was overrun by the French Army, French cavalry charging the Dutch Navy <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> that blocked its winter anchorages, capturing it intact. The French reorganised the country into a client state named the Batavian Republic, and ordered the Dutch Navy to operate in the North Sea against British maritime trade routes. The British government did not immediately declare war on the Batavian Republic, but did take steps to seize Dutch shipping in British ports and established a new fleet to combat Batavian operations in the North Sea. The North Sea Fleet, as it was known, was composed mainly of older and smaller vessels not considered suitable for service in the Channel Fleet, and command of this force was given to the 66year old Admiral Adam Duncan.|$|E
5|$|Team Canada took {{a number}} of {{questionable}} early penalties. With two Canadians (White and Peter Mahovlich) off, Yakushev scored to give the Soviets the lead 1–0. The game was delayed after a mistaken call against J. P. Parise, (he was called for interference, but Parise admitted later he was guilty of cross-checking) and emotions boiled over. Parise was called for a misconduct for banging his stick on the ice, {{and when he saw}} the misconduct called, he dashed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> with his stick raised. Parise nearly swung his stick at Kompalla and got a match penalty. Sinden threw a chair on the ice. Some writers have commented that the incidents resulted {{in the rest of the}} game being refereed capably.|$|E

5|$|The Mounties arrive {{the next}} morning, in hot pursuit. Kripik {{prevents}} {{his eldest son}} from killing the Mounties, and says he will leave and never come back. Kripik departs on foot, but Iva professes her love and goes with him. The Mounties pursue them on foot <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> which is breaking up. Sergeant Hunt takes aim at Kripik with his rifle, but cannot shoot him because Kripik has saved their lives and exhibited more honor and decency than white men have. Kripik and Iva escape on an ice floe, Hunt calling out goodbye {{and good luck to}} them. Hunt tells Balk that the ice will take Kripik and Iva across the inlet, and that the adults will be able to return to Orsodikok and the other children next spring.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1944, {{plans were}} made to send the brigade, which had been renamed the 1st Commando Brigade, to the Far East; however, {{the effect of the}} German Ardennes Offensive {{resulted}} in these being cancelled. In January 1945, under the command of Brigadier Derek Mills-Roberts, No. 3 Commando was deployed to Asten on the Maas. Later in the month, the unit took up positions at Maeseyck and on 24–25 January, with snow falling on the streets and a heavy German artillery barrage on the town, they took part in an assault on Linne. The assault was only partially successful and due to the destruction of the bridges that spanned the frozen Montforterbeek Canal, the Allies were unable to bring up armour to support No. 3 Commando which had moved <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> on foot. When the Germans brought up their own tanks, the advance came to a halt.|$|E
5|$|Washington again {{proposed}} to assault Boston in October, but his officers {{thought it best}} {{to wait until the}} harbor had frozen over. In February, when the water had frozen between Roxbury and Boston Common, Washington thought that in spite of his shortage in powder he would try an assault by rushing across the ice; but his officers again advised against it. Washington's desire to launch an attack on Boston arose from his fear that his army would desert in the winter, and how easily he knew that Howe could break the lines of his army in its present condition. He had not yet learned how completely he could trust in Howe's inactivity; he abandoned an attack <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> with great reluctance in exchange for a more cautious plan, to fortify Dorchester Heights using cannon arrived from Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E
50|$|During the 1173 sol-stay on the Martian surface {{the crew}} would {{carry out a}} number of expeditions <b>across</b> <b>the</b> polar <b>ice</b> cap.

The study also considered the possibility of exploratory mid-winter expeditions <b>across</b> <b>the</b> polar <b>ice</b> cap. These expeditions would be supported by pressurised and unpressurised rovers. Trafficability issues of trans-polar expeditions were considered.|$|R

5|$|Bartlett's initial {{plan had}} been for the group to rest briefly on Wrangel Island and then to move on {{together}} to the Siberian coast. However, because three men—Mamen, Malloch and Maurer—were injured, and others were weak and frostbitten, Bartlett decided that the main party should remain on the island while he went for help taking only Kataktovik. The pair started off on 18 March, with seven dogs and provisions for 48 days (30 days for the dogs), and took an extended route round the island's southern shores to look for signs of Anderson's or Mackay's parties. After finding nothing, they headed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> towards Siberia, but progress was slow over a surface that was frequently shifting and breaking up to form leads of open water. More time was lost digging out their provisions from the steadily drifting snow. As they drew nearer to the mainland, Kataktovik became nervous; he had heard that the Alaskan Inuit were disliked in Siberia by the native Chukchi people, and feared for his life. Bartlett {{did his best to}} reassure him as they moved slowly forward.|$|E

50|$|There were a {{total of}} seven granite {{quarries}} in town. Around 1900, a granite quarry was located {{on the east side}} of Crystal Lake.

25|$|There is a {{very large}} danger with glacier travel, with even short treks <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> As an example, glaciers are often broken with cracks, called crevasses, that are often covered with snow and not visible.

25|$|Pair lifts are {{generally}} overhead. According {{to the current}} ISU rules for senior-level competition, the man must rotate more than once, but fewer than three-and-a-half times.

5000|$|Denmark {{attacked}} Swedish dominions in Germany in 1657. This {{meant that}} the Swedish army, including the forces under Ascheberg's command, left Poland to instead engage their Danish enemy. [...] In 1658, Ascheberg spearheaded <b>the</b> March <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Belts as the Swedish army marched <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>ices</b> of Little Belt and Great Belt {{in order to reach}} the Danish island of Zealand. [...] He narrowly escaped being caught when the enemy under Frederick William of Brandenburg and Polish commander Stefan Czarniecki attacked Sønderborg in December 1658. In February 1659, he was badly wounded during the assault on Copenhagen. After spending 10 weeks abed, a recovered von Ascheberg returned to the battlefield in time {{to be in charge of}} the conquest of the island Møn in May 1659.

25|$|Sweden and Denmark fought several wars {{during the}} 16th and 17th centuries.
