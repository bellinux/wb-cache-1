5|$|The 300 pages {{removed from}} the A Game of Thrones {{manuscript}} served as {{the opening of the}} second book, entitled <b>A</b> <b>Clash</b> of Kings. It was released in February 1999 in the United States, with a manuscript length (without appendices) of 1184 pages. <b>A</b> <b>Clash</b> of Kings was the first book of the Ice and Fire series to make the best-seller lists, reaching 13 on The New York Times Best Seller list in 1999. After the success of The Lord of the Rings films, Martin received his first inquiries to the rights of the Ice and Fire series from various producers and filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|After A Game of Thrones, <b>A</b> <b>Clash</b> of Kings, and A Storm of Swords, Martin {{originally}} intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled A Dance with Dragons, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin wanted to set this story five years after A Storm of Swords so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than A Storm of Swords, Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to <b>A</b> <b>Clash</b> of Kings. A long prologue was to establish {{what had happened in}} the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|Among others, Iran's {{supreme leader}} Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blamed a Zionist {{conspiracy}} for the row over the cartoons. Palestinian Christian diplomat Afif Safieh, then the Palestine Liberation Organization's envoy to Washington, alleged the Likud party concocted {{the distribution of}} Muhammad caricatures worldwide {{in a bid to}} create <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> between the West and the Muslim world.|$|E

5|$|In {{the reserve}} race, Cambridge's Goldie won as Oxford's Isis were disqualified. After Isis {{had taken a}} three-quarter-length lead, <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> of blades {{resulted}} in irreparable damage to the Cambridge boat and a red flag from umpire John Garrett. Cambridge won the 45th Women's Boat Race by three-and-a-quarter lengths {{in a time of}} 7 minutes and 17 seconds, their third victory in four years.|$|E
5|$|On the {{southern}} flank, the North Carolina brigade of Brig. Gen. James H. Lane contributed {{little to the}} assault; he was kept busy by <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> with Union cavalry on the Hagerstown Road. Brig. Gen. Edward L. Thomas's Georgia Brigade was in reserve well to the rear, not summoned by Pender or Hill to assist or exploit the breakthrough.|$|E
5|$|The {{final draft}} went smoothly, except for <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> with {{the editors of}} The Russian Messenger, about which very little is known. Since the {{manuscript}} Dostoyevsky turned in to Katkov was lost, it is unclear to what the editors had objected in the original.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} years of war saw {{conflict}} in the North Sea limited to skirmishes by battlecruisers at the Battle of Heligoland Bight and Battle of Dogger Bank, and raids on the English coast. In May 1916, a further attempt to draw British ships into battle on favourable terms resulted in <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> of the battlefleets on 31 May to 1 June in the indecisive Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{criticism}} of Inseminoid has {{concentrated on the}} film's treatment of the female sex and female sexualities {{in the context of}} corruption by an alien source. In addition to its depiction of the abject Sandy, who is rendered a distorted Other in the aftermath of her unnatural impregnation, the film has been seen to incorporate <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> between the patriarchal and the maternal towards its climax, as the new mother kills her former friends one by one. Complementing the film's successful VHS run, a novelisation of Inseminoid was written by Larry Miller.|$|E
5|$|According to Croatian {{political}} scientist Vladimir Filipović, {{it is unclear}} whether the limited resources earmarked for the operation and the unclear motivation of CANBAT 1 troops would stop several HV brigades; according to Hague, the plan did not indicate how CANBAT 1 or the other elements of the UNPROFOR would retreat through Croatia after such <b>a</b> <b>clash.</b> Hague questioned the feasibility of Operation Backstop, because the advance-warning requirement was considered impossible to meet. The UNPROFOR had no reliable military intelligence on HV movements outside the UNPAs, or beyond -wide zones around the UNPAs (where only United Nations Military Observers were present). However, Hague considered Operation Backstop a deterrent.|$|E

5|$|After Speers' {{retirement}} in 1957, John Middaugh was minister from 1958 to 1968. Middaugh {{was a regular}} panelist for ten years on the weekly television program To Promote Goodwill, an interfaith discussion of social and religious issues produced by WBAL-TV and broadcast worldwide on the Voice of America. He {{was also in the}} forefront {{of the civil rights movement}} in the early 1960s. Along with William Sloan Coffin and dozens of other clergymen and civil rights activists, Middaugh was arrested in <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> with police at Baltimore's Gwynn Oak Amusement Park in July 1963 over efforts to desegregate the popular attraction.|$|E
5|$|Away colours {{have tended}} to be either white—often with black shorts—or a {{combination}} of yellow and black, referring back to the black and gold strips of the pre-war era, although for a time in the 1970s, Aberdeen sported an all-blue change strip with white socks. For the 2007–08 season, the change strip was all-white, with a third kit of yellow and black halves available if needed for European games, or in the event of <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> involving both red and white.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{qualified}} six {{athletes in}} individual short track speed skating events. In the men's events four skaters competed, with Anthony Douglas and Jon Eley each racing at two distances; a team also {{qualified for the}} relay event. Eley achieved the squad's best individual finish, coming sixth in 500 metres, a position matched by the relay team. In the women's events Elise Christie raced in the 500, 1000 and 1500 metres and Sarah Lindsay also {{took part in the}} 500 metres but was disqualified in her heat following <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> with Canada's Jessica Gregg.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} he carried out several {{significant}} legislative changes. In 1924, as Minister for Housing, Denny was {{closely associated with}} the Thousand Homes Scheme, which aimed to provide affordable housing, particularly for returned soldiers and their families, and lower income groups. The land used for this development was the site of the Mitcham military camp at which Denny had trained before embarking for service overseas. Denny's work on the Scheme resulted in <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> with former Premier Sir Henry Barwell, whom he sued for libel after Barwell made statements suggesting that Denny had made false statements to induce merchants to provide goods and services. Barwell later apologised for his comments.|$|E
5|$|Free {{from their}} loyalties to the pharaoh, local rulers began {{competing}} {{with each other}} for territorial control and political power. By 2160BC, rulers in Herakleopolis controlled Lower Egypt in the north, while a rival clan based in Thebes, the Intef family, took control of Upper Egypt in the south. As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward, <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055BC the northern Theban forces under Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers, reuniting the Two Lands. They inaugurated a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the Middle Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In April 1949, Stewart {{replaced}} Major General Norman Weir as Chief of the General Staff, New Zealand Military Forces. He reestablished compulsory {{military training}} and advanced {{plans for the}} government's commitment to deploy military forces to the Middle East {{in the event of}} hostilities with the Soviet Union. This led to <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> with Prime Minister Sydney Holland in 1950 over the rate of progress of these plans for which he later apologised. He also oversaw the deployment of New Zealand forces to Korea following the outbreak of the Korean War.|$|E

5|$|Kantakouzenos and Umur raided Bulgaria, {{and then}} turned against Momchil. The latter had {{exploited}} the power vacuum in the Rhodope, an effective no man's land between the Serbs, Bulgarians and Byzantines, to set himself up as a quasi-independent prince, supported by a substantial force of around 5,000 men. On 7 July 1345, the two armies clashed at Peritheorion. Momchil's army was crushed, and he himself fell in the field. Soon afterwards, Dušan arrived before Serres and laid siege to the city. Rejecting demands by Kantakouzenos to withdraw, <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> appeared inevitable until the murder of Alexios Apokaukos in Constantinople forced Kantakouzenos to direct his attention there.|$|E
5|$|On 26 April 2008, Drogba faced {{controversy}} after <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> with Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidić. The Serbian centre-back {{had to have}} stitches {{under his}} lip after losing a tooth in the clash. There was discussion whether Drogba had the intention or not to injure his rival. The debate also called into question an earlier incident on 26 November 2006 where Drogba elbowed Vidić. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson expressed concerns over elbowing in the Premier League. Despite media speculation, Drogba's yellow card for the clash was deemed adequate punishment by the Football Association.|$|E
5|$|Preceding {{the reform}} law, in August 1952, communist-led riots broke out at textile {{factories}} in Kafr el-Dawwar, leading to <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> {{with the army}} that left nine people dead. While most of the RCC insisted on executing the riot's two ringleaders, Nasser opposed this. Nonetheless, the sentences were carried out. The Muslim Brotherhood supported the RCC, and after Naguib's assumption of power, demanded four ministerial portfolios in the new cabinet. Nasser turned down their demands and instead hoped to co-opt the Brotherhood by giving two of its members, {{who were willing to}} serve officially as independents, minor ministerial posts.|$|E
