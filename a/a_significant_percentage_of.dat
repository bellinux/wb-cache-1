40|$|CONTEXT: Exposure of hepatocytes to {{pathological}} {{conditions in}} a microenvironment of hypoxia and reoxygenation is very frequent in hepatic diseases. Several substances present perspectives for cytoprotective action on hepatocyte submitted to reoxygenation after hypoxia and simple hypoxia. OBJECTIVE: We research therapeutic options for hepatocytes submitted to hypoxia and hypoxia + reoxygenation injury. METHODS: Primary culture of rat hepatocytes was submitted to hypoxia (2 hours) plus reoxygenation (2 hours) and simple hypoxia (4 hours) {{in the presence}} or the absence of cytoprotectors. The hepatocyte lesion was evaluated by functional criteria through <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> lactate dehydrogenase released and cell viability. The effects of the cytoprotectors prostaglandin E 1 3 &# 951;g/mL, superoxide dismutase 80 &# 956;g/mL, allopurinol 20 &# 956;M and verapamil 10 - 4 M were studied in this model of injury. RESULTS: Reoxygenation after hypoxia induced more significant lesion in cultured hepatocytes compared to simple hypoxia, detected by analysis of functional criteria. There was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> lactate dehydrogenase released and <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> increase <b>of</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> cell viability in the hypoxia + reoxygenation + cytoprotectors groups compared to hypoxia + reoxygenation groups. Prostaglandin E 1, superoxide dismutase and verapamil also protected the group submitted to simple hypoxia, when evaluated by functional criteria. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that reoxygenation after hypoxia significantly increased the lesion of cultured rat hepatocytes when compared to simple hypoxia. Prostaglandin E 1, superoxide dismutase, allopurinol and verapamil acted as cytoprotectors to the rat cultured hepatocytes submitted to hypoxia + reoxygenation in vitro. The substances prostaglandin E 1, superoxide dismutase and verapamil protected hepatocytes submitted to simple hypoxia {{on the basis of}} all the criteria studied in this experimental model...|$|R

5|$|Between the 16th {{century and}} the mid-19th century, Britain saw a large {{increase}} in agricultural productivity and net output. New agricultural practices like enclosure, mechanization, four-field crop rotation to maintain soil nutrients, and selective breeding enabled an unprecedented population growth to 5.7 million in 1750, freeing up <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the workforce, and thereby helped drive the Industrial Revolution.

5|$|Like many Moroccan cities, Marrakesh {{comprises}} an old fortified city {{packed with}} vendors and their stalls (the medina), bordered by modern neighbourhoods, {{the most prominent}} of which is Gueliz. Today {{it is one of the}} busiest cities in Africa and serves as a major economic centre and tourist destination. Tourism is strongly advocated by the reigning Moroccan monarch, Mohammed VI, with the goal of doubling the number of tourists visiting Morocco to 20 million by 2020. Despite the economic recession, real estate and hotel development in Marrakesh has grown dramatically in the 21st century. Marrakesh is particularly popular with the French, and numerous French celebrities own property in the city. Marrakesh has the largest traditional market (souk) in Morocco, with some 18 souks selling wares ranging from traditional Berber carpets to modern consumer electronics. Crafts employ <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the population, who primarily sell their products to tourists. Marrakesh is one of North Africaâ€™s largest centres of wildlife trade, despite the illegality of much of this trade. Much of this trade can be found in the medina and adjacent squares. Tortoises are particularly popular for sale as pets but Barbary macaques and snakes can also be seen.|$|E

5|$|Other {{difficulties}} arose {{when the}} Empire's parliament, the General Assembly, opened in 1826. PedroI, along with <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the legislature, argued {{for an independent}} judiciary, a popularly elected legislature and a government which would be led by the emperor who held broad executive powers and prerogatives. Others in parliament argued for a similar structure, only with a less influential role for the monarch and the legislative branch being dominant in policy and governance. The struggle over whether the government would be dominated by the emperor or by the parliament was carried over into debates from 1826 to 1831 on {{the establishment of the}} governmental and political structure. Unable to deal with the problems in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, the Emperor abdicated on behalf of his son, PedroII, on 7 April 1831 and immediately sailed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorials}} to World War I {{were shaped}} by the traumatic nature of the conflict {{and its impact on}} individuals and communities. The experience of the different nations varied considerably, but common themes emerged. The war required a mass call to arms, with <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the population mobilised to fight, either as volunteers or through conscription. Campaigns were conducted on multiple fronts across Europe and beyond. The fighting was mechanised and conducted on an industrial scale; existing weapons, such as machine guns and artillery, were combined with the innovative deployment of aircraft, submarines and poison gas. In many theatres of operation, mobile campaigns degenerated into static trench warfare, depending on the slow attrition of the enemy over many years for victory. The battles spread across larger areas than ever before, with key engagements, such as that at Verdun etched on the memories of the nations involved.|$|E
5|$|The scale, and {{associated}} {{high number of}} casualties, of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead. Previous to World War I, individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers. However, the war required mobilisation of <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the population, either as volunteers or through conscription. An expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated, {{even if they were}} low-ranking members of the military. A committee under Frederic Kenyon, Director of the British Museum, presented a report to the Commission in November 1918 detailing how it envisioned the development of the cemeteries. Two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions. Beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses, it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling of brotherhood that had developed between serving ranks.|$|E
