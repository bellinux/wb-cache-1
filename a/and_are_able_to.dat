5|$|Packaging: SiC chips {{may have}} a higher power density than silicon power devices <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> handle higher {{temperatures}} exceeding the silicon limit of 150°C. New die attach technologies such as sintering are required to efficiently get the heat out of the devices and ensure a reliable interconnection.|$|E
5|$|The {{stems of}} most cacti are some shade of green, often bluish or {{brownish}} green. Such stems contain chlorophyll <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> carry out photosynthesis; {{they also have}} stomata (small structures that can open and close to allow passage of gases). Cactus stems are often visibly waxy.|$|E
50|$|The virion {{essentially}} is a nucleocapsid that is visible under an electron microscope <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> infect cultured cells {{from a broad}} range of mammals including rabbit kidney (RK13), African green monkey kidney (Vero), equine foetal kidney (EFK), <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> infect humans.|$|R

5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the hardiest insects. Some species are capable of {{remaining}} active for a month without food <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> survive on limited resources, such as the glue {{from the back of}} postage stamps. Some can go without air for 45 minutes. Japanese cockroach (Periplaneta japonica) nymphs, which hibernate in cold winters, survived twelve hours at −5°C to −8°C in laboratory experiments.|$|E

5|$|Currently, {{veterans}} who provide evidence meeting VA requirements for service in Vietnam, {{and who can}} medically establish that anytime after this 'presumptive exposure' they developed any medical problems {{on the list of}} presumptive diseases, may receive compensation from the VA. Certain {{veterans who}} served in Korea <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> prove they were assigned to certain specified around the DMZ during a specific time frame are afforded similar presumption.|$|E
5|$|Disturbance {{has been}} implicated in the {{formation}} of vegetation dominated by large Attalea species. In seasonally dry Amazonian forests the density of large adult A.maripa palms was correlated with canopy openness; the species also dominates savannas formed by repeated forest fires in Trinidad and Tobago. Attalea speciosa forms pure stands in many parts of Brazil where natural forest vegetation has been cleared. Similarly, stands of A.funifera in Bahia, Brazil (which are cultivated for piassava fibre) are managed using fire—the seedlings survive cutting and burning, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> dominate burned forest patches.|$|E
5|$|Many {{sequence}} alignment {{and protein}} structure alignment algorithms {{have been developed}} assuming linear data representations and as such {{are not able to}} detect circular permutations between proteins. Two examples of frequently used methods that have problems correctly aligning proteins related by circular permutation are dynamic programming and many hidden Markov models. As an alternative to these, a number of algorithms are built on top of non-linear approaches <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> detect topology-independent similarities, or employ modifications allowing them to circumvent the limitations of dynamic programming. The table below is a collection of such methods.|$|E

5|$|Amy starts {{becoming}} more afflicted {{by the image}} of the Angel in her eye, and the Doctor instructs her to keep her eyes closed, preventing her from seeing it. Octavian has the clerics guard Amy while he, the Doctor, and River make for a secondary control room {{on the other side of}} the oxygen factory. During this, the Doctor learns that River is Octavian's prisoner, promised a full pardon if she helped capture the Angel. Octavian is killed by an Angel but this allows the Doctor and River to enter and secure the control room. They analyze the crack the Doctor saw and confirm that the leaking energy came from an explosion in time, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> narrow the date of the explosion's epicenter.|$|E
5|$|Fish are cold-blooded, and {{in general}} their body {{temperature}} {{is the same as}} that of their surroundings. They gain and lose heat through their skin and during respiration <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> regulate their circulation in response to changes in water temperature by increasing or reducing the blood flow to the gills. Metabolic heat generated in the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through the gills, with blood being diverted away from the gills during exposure to cold. Because of their relative inability to control their blood temperature, most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures.|$|E

5|$|In the Imperial City, Mulan {{attempts}} to warn Li Shang about Shan Yu, but {{he refuses to}} listen. The Huns appear and capture the Emperor, locking themselves inside the palace. With Mulan's help, Li Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po pose as concubines <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> enter the palace and defeat Shan Yu's men. As Shang prevents Shan Yu from assassinating the Emperor, Mulan lures the Hun onto the roof where she engages him in single combat. Meanwhile, acting on Mulan's instructions, Mushu fires a bundle of fireworks rockets at Shan Yu on her signal and kills him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the other}} world, Oliver finds a {{multitude}} of broken-hearted people affected by Jabou, and uses his new-found magic abilities to restore those pieces of heart which they lack, and travels the world {{to seek out the}} four great sages who may be able to help. Along the way, he meets Maru, daughter of one of the great sages, and Jairo, a thief who initially steals a crucial item from them, but who ultimately decides to help. As they enlist the sages' help, they learn of a wand {{that could be used to}} defeat Jabou, but are at a loss as to how to retrieve it, as it was recently destroyed by Jabou. Soon after, they find themselves many years in the past by the actions of a stranger, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> retrieve the wand there.|$|E
5|$|In-game, Terrans tend {{to favor}} {{traditional}} modes of warfare, often utilizing combined arms tactics with tanks, aircraft or other combat vehicles in combination with regular infantry. Using light ballistics, large calibre weapons and even tactical nuclear warheads, many Terran units are reminiscent of present-day designs. Terrans are the only race without a melee combat unit. Terrans are more adaptive {{than the other two}} races <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> produce units at an average expense. Primary base structures can even lift off and fly to other locations, allowing players to move buildings for quicker troop deployments, access to new resource locations or to save the structures from destruction by the enemy. Terran buildings and mechanized units can be repaired if damaged, and combat medics can heal wounded organic units.|$|E

5|$|Mothers {{give birth}} to furred and blind cubs in an {{underground}} den near the river shore and fishing sites. Males actively participate in rearing cubs and family cohesion is strong; older, juvenile siblings also participate in rearing, although in the weeks immediately after birth, they may temporarily leave the group. Pups open their eyes in their fourth week, begin walking in their fifth, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> swim confidently between 12 and 14 weeks old. They are weaned by nine months and begin hunting successfully soon after. The animal reaches sexual maturity at about two {{years of age and}} both male and female pups leave the group permanently after two to three years. They then search for new territory to begin a family of their own.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{woodpeckers}} are arboreal {{birds of}} wooded habitats. They reach their greatest diversity in tropical rainforests, but occur {{in almost all}} suitable habitats including woodlands, savannahs, scrublands, and bamboo forests. Even grasslands and deserts have been colonised by various species. These habitats are more easily occupied where {{a small number of}} trees exist, or, in the case of desert species like the Gila woodpecker, tall cacti are available for nesting. Some are specialists and are associated with coniferous or deciduous woodland or even, like the acorn woodpecker, with individual tree genera (oaks in this case). Other species are generalists <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> adapt to forest clearance by exploiting secondary growth, plantations, orchards and parks. In general, forest-dwelling species need rotting or dead wood on which to forage.|$|E
5|$|Peggy tries {{in vain to}} {{extinguish}} the flames, but is forced out by her friends and family. Stacey, unaware of the events, heads upstairs to Lily and becomes trapped. She uses the crowbar to smash a boarded-up window and hands Lily over to Ryan, who has climbed a ladder. Peggy realises Phil is still inside {{and returns to the}} building with Billy. They find him trapped beneath a wooden beam, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> drag him out to safety. Ryan goes back up the ladder and carries an unconscious Stacey out. Stacey regains consciousness and sees that Lily is safe, and tells Ryan that Lily is his daughter. Peggy stares at the pub as it is completely destroyed.|$|E
