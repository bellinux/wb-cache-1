British authorities attempted to contact his relatives in Lithuania, but Lithuania—as a Soviet Socialist Republic— {{was behind the}} Iron Curtain, and they were advised to stop these attempts since his relatives might suffer negative consequences. At the time Soviet authorities saw those people who maintained contacts with the West as untrustworthy.|$|E
25|$|From 1941 to 1942, Allied bombers {{very rarely}} flew over Switzerland, because the Swiss authorities, under German pressure, {{prescribed}} black-outs {{in order to}} complicate navigation for the U.S. and British <b>air</b> <b>crews.</b> As the neutral Swiss territory was safe for Allied bombers, Germany also pressured the Swiss into forcing the Allied <b>air</b> <b>crews</b> to land in Switzerland, instead of letting them continue bombing runs.|$|R

5|$|Overall, the Second Army {{contingent}} {{consisted of}} 83,115 men, 61,715 of them British. The nominally British air and naval support units included {{a large number}} of personnel from Allied nations, including several RAF squadrons manned almost exclusively by overseas <b>air</b> <b>crew.</b> For example, the Australian contribution to the operation included a regular Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) squadron, nine Article XV squadrons, and hundreds of personnel posted to RAF units and RN warships. The RAF supplied two-thirds of the aircraft involved in the invasion.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{joined the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 28 June 1940 and was passed fit for <b>air</b> <b>crew</b> duty. The RAAF had more {{recruits}} than it could equip and train and Bradman spent {{four months in}} Adelaide before the Governor-General of Australia, Lord Gowrie, persuaded Bradman to transfer to the army, a move that was criticised as a safer option for him. Given the rank of Lieutenant, he was posted to the Army School of Physical Training at Frankston, Victoria, {{to act as a}} divisional supervisor of physical training. The exertion of the job aggravated his chronic muscular problems, diagnosed as fibrositis. Surprisingly, in light of his batting prowess, a routine army test revealed that Bradman had poor eyesight.|$|E
5|$|In 1963 and 1964 the Egyptians {{had five}} squadrons of {{aircraft}} in Yemen at airfields near San'a and Hodeida. They were using Yak-11 piston-engined fighters, MiG-15 and MiG-17 jet fighters, Ilyushin Il-28 twin-engined bombers, Ilyushin Il-14 twin-engined transports and Mil Mi-4 transport helicopters. They were also flying four-engined Tupolev bombers from bases in Egypt, such as Aswan. All the <b>air</b> <b>crew</b> were Egyptian, {{except for the}} Tupolev bombers which were thought to have mixed Egyptian and Russian personnel. The Ilyushin transports flying between Egypt and Hodeida had Russian crews. Throughout the war, the Egyptians relied on airlift. In January 1964, when royalist forces placed San'a under siege, Egyptian Antonov heavy-lift cargo planes airlifted tons of food and kerosene into the region. The Egyptians estimate that {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars were spent to equip Egyptian and republican Yemeni forces, and in addition, Moscow refurbished the Al-Rawda Airfield outside San'a. The politburo saw a chance to gain a toehold on the Arabian Peninsula and accepted hundreds of Egyptian officers to be trained as pilots for service in the Yemen War.|$|E

5|$|No. 12 Squadron was {{the first}} Vengeance-equipped RAAF unit to see combat. After {{converting}} to the dive bomber, the squadron was used on routine patrol and search-and-rescue tasks {{off the coast of}} the Northern Territory. On 18 June 1943, twelve Vengeances from the squadron, escorted by six No. 31 Squadron Bristol Beaufighters, were dispatched to attack two villages on Selaru island in the occupied Netherlands East Indies that were believed to be housing workers engaged in constructing an airfield. This operation was successful, and all the dive bombers returned to base. In July 1943 the squadron began moving from Darwin to Merauke in Netherlands New Guinea, where it was to operate as part of No. 72 Wing. A party of 270 ground crew arrived at Merauke early that month, but little of the infrastructure needed to support the unit's aircraft was ready. As a result, No. 12 Squadron's Vengeances and <b>air</b> <b>crew</b> were stationed at Cooktown, Queensland, from where they conducted anti-submarine patrols and escorted shipping. The aircraft were redeployed to Merauke over the course of September, and began regular patrol duties on the 28th of the month. No. 12 Squadron's only combat during this deployment occurred on 9 October 1943, when a Vengeance exchanged machine-gun fire with a Japanese Aichi E13A reconnaissance aircraft. The Vengeances proved unsuited to the maritime patrol tasks they were assigned while at Cooktown and Merauke.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF's Chinook fleet {{suffered}} two serious accidents. On 26 June 1975, A15-011 crashed {{when one}} of its engine turbines disintegrated. No. 3 Aircraft Depot was assigned responsibility for repairing the helicopter, {{but it did not}} reenter service until 21 May 1981 as the maintenance unit lacked experience with major helicopter repairs. On 4 February 1985, A15-001 struck power lines and crashed into Perseverance Dam near Toowoomba, Queensland, while undertaking a navigation exercise. The helicopter's pilot, an exchange officer from the Royal Air Force, was killed and the other three aircrew suffered minor injuries. The helicopter was written off and used as a fire training aid at Amberley. The court of inquiry into this incident found that the <b>air</b> <b>crew</b> were unaware of the presence of the power lines as they were not marked on the maps used to plan the flight, and were difficult to see. However, the inquiry also judged that the mission had been inadequately planned and recommended that No. 12 Squadron update the master map used for preparing operations in the Amberley region to ensure that it included all flying hazards.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Air</b> <b>Crew</b> Europe Star {{was instituted}} in May 1945 to commemorate flying {{operations}} from the United Kingdom over Europe and was intended primarily for award to <b>air</b> <b>crew.</b> Two clasps were instituted {{to be worn}} on the <b>Air</b> <b>Crew</b> Europe Star's medal ribbon, the Atlantic Clasp and the France and Germany Clasp.|$|E
