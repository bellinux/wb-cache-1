40|$|Initial {{testing and}} {{commissioning}} of two high power klystrons (TH 2103 D) and gyrotron (VGA 8000 A 19) {{have been carried out}} at our Institute. Each of the klystrons is capable of delivering 500 kW at 3. 7 GHz, to be used for non-inductive lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) in the Steady State Superconducting Tokamak (SST- 1). The gyrotron is capable of delivering 200 KW at 28 GHz, for breakdown and electron cyclotron resonant heating (ECRH) experiments on Aditya tokamak. The potential appearing at the anode point with respect to the cathode will turn-ON, turn-OFF and control the beam current. Thus these <b>anode</b> modulator <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> control the out put power of the devices. Main input for both the <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> is derived from the cathode <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> A - 2 kV bias <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is connected between the modulator output and anode terminal to suppress dark current. The output pulse duration is adjustable from 50 msec. to 1000 sec. by the control system. The oil cooled tetrode YU 155 is used as shunt voltage regulator in the klystron <b>anode</b> modulator <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> A potential divider is made with the tetrode as a series element.

5000|$|The aquadag coating has two functions: it {{maintains}} a uniform electric field inside the tube near the screen, so the electron beam remains collimated {{and is not}} distorted by external fields, and it collects the electrons after they have hit the screen, serving as the return path for the cathode current. [...] When the electron beam hits the screen, in addition to causing the fluorescent phosphor coating to give off light, it also knocks other electrons out of the surface. These secondary electrons are attracted to the high positive voltage of the coating and return through it to the <b>anode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> Without the coating a negative space charge would develop near the screen, deflecting the electron beam. A typical value of beam current collected by the anode coating is 0.6 mA.|$|R

Four high power gyrotrons (three- 77 GHz/ 1 ~ 1. 5 MW and one- 154 GHz/ 1 MW) and a CW gyrotron (84 GHz/ 0. 2 MW) are ready. Our experiment requires high energy and various injection patterns for Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH). Higher individual injection power and various injection patterns, we developed a power enhancement method by stepped anode acceleration voltage control and operated the gyrotron in the hard excitation region. These operations were realized by a remote controlled waveform generator. However the oscillation map of high power or long pulse operation in the hard excitation region were limited because {{in order to achieve}} the hard excitation region by the anode voltage control one must pass through the high anode current phase within a time short enough that the anode or the <b>anode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is not overloaded. This limitation becomes more critical when the gyrotron beam current is increased in order to increase the output power. In the long pulse operation it was impossible to reach the hard excitation region in a low beam current (< 10 A) ...|$|R
5000|$|Early tube {{amplifiers}} had <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> {{based on}} rectifier tubes. These supplies were unregulated, a practice {{which continues to}} this day in transistor amplifier designs. The typical <b>anode</b> <b>supply</b> was a rectifier, perhaps half-wave, a choke (inductor) and a filter capacitor. When the tube amplifier was operated at high volume, due to the high impedance of the rectifier tubes, the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> voltage would dip as the amplifier drew more current (assuming class AB), reducing power output and causing signal modulation. The dipping effect is known as [...] "sag." [...] Sag may be desirable effect for some electric guitarists when compared with hard clipping. As the amplifier load or output increases this voltage drop will increase distortion of the output signal. Sometimes this sag effect is desirable for guitar amplification.|$|R
5000|$|Early valve {{amplifiers}} used unregulated <b>power</b> <b>supplies.</b> This {{was due to}} {{the high}} cost associated with high-quality high-voltage <b>power</b> <b>supplies.</b> The typical <b>anode</b> (plate) <b>supply</b> was simply a rectifier, an inductor and a capacitor. When the valve amplifier was operated at high volume, the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> voltage would dip, reducing power output and causing signal attenuation and compression. This dipping effect is known as [...] "sag", and is sought-after by some electric guitarists. Sag only occurs in class-AB amplifiers. This is because, technically, sag results from more current being drawn from the <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> causing a greater voltage drop over the rectifier valve. In a class-A amplifier, current draw is constant, so sag does not occur.|$|R

50|$|A {{switched-mode}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (switching-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switch-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switched <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> SMPS, or switcher) is {{an electronic}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently. Like other <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source (often mains power) to DC loads, {{such as a}} personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, a switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> dissipates no <b>power.</b> Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor. This higher power conversion efficiency is an important advantage of a switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> Switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> may also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply due to the smaller transformer size and weight.|$|R
40|$|This master’s {{thesis is}} dealing with low {{frequency}} all valve stereo amplifier unit conception for an electric guitar. The amplifier contains two independent output stages with two power tubes EL 34, working in AB class, with 40 Watts of power. The apparatus is equipped with two channels, EQ correctors, parallel effects loop, output selection with lowered <b>anode</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> selection between silicon or tube rectifier. The preamplifier works in mono mode and the stereophony is reached by dividing the signal in an added effects system. This unusual solution differs from both monaural conceptions and binaural power amplifiers which contains no preamp. It offers the possibility of stereophony without the necessity of dividing the guitar signal before the amplifier’s input. The sound {{that comes from the}} speaker on one side is effected {{and on the other side}} is dry by using monaural effects apparatus. The sound from both speakers is effected by using binaural effect apparatus. The amplifier can be used as power amplifier stage only when the return of the effect loop is used as the amplifier input. Every available possible solution is discussed in case of each block and then the most suitable is chosen. The biggest attention is paid to a proposal and calculation of both power and output transformer, ergonomical lay-out of the stages in need of the best S/N separation. The stages were simulated in Micro-Cap 9. 0 and Tonestack 1. 3 computer programmes. The construction was carried out with the emphasis on proper shielding and grounding. The overall stability tests were performed after building the amplifier as well as frequency characteristics with the scope and distortion with the distortion meter...|$|R
