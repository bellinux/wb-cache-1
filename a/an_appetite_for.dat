25|$|While at school, Gautier befriended Gérard de Nerval {{and the two}} became lifelong friends. It {{is through}} Nerval that Gautier was {{introduced}} to Victor Hugo, by then already a well-known, established leading dramatist and author of Hernani. Hugo became {{a major influence on}} Gautier and is credited for giving him, an aspiring painter at the time, <b>an</b> <b>appetite</b> <b>for</b> literature. It was at the legendary premiere of Hernani that Gautier is remembered for wearing his anachronistic red doublet.|$|E

Pica can be dangerous to dogs, with a risk from eating dirt near roads that existed prior to the phaseout of tetraethyllead in gasoline or prior to the cessation {{of the use of}} contaminated oil (either used, or containing toxic PCBs) to settle dust.

25|$|Rome's {{governing}} elite produced laws {{designed to}} limit {{public displays of}} personal wealth and luxury. None were particularly successful; the same wealthy elite had <b>an</b> <b>appetite</b> <b>for</b> luxurious clothing. Exotic fabrics were available, at a price; silk damasks, translucent gauzes, cloth of gold, and intricate embroideries; and vivid, expensive dyes such as saffron yellow or Tyrian purple. Not all dyes were costly, however, and most Romans wore colourful clothing. Clean, bright clothing was a mark of respectability and status among all social classes. The fastenings and brooches used to secure garments such as cloaks provided further opportunities for personal embellishment and display.|$|E
25|$|After Paul Weekes {{had taken}} Middlesex Crusaders to 149 for 5 after his 72, the young batsmen showed <b>an</b> <b>appetite</b> <b>for</b> runs as Glamorgan Dragons sunk to a defeat in this match between number {{two and three}} in the one-day tables. Both Ed Joyce and Ben Hutton made 61 at rates well-over a run a ball, and added 110 for the sixth wicket, before number 11 Alan Richardson {{finished}} off with a last-ball six off Robert Croft to bring the total to 284 for 9 after Croft had grabbed three late wickets. Chris Peploe then took four for 38, pinch hitters Croft and Alex Wharf were run out, Owais Shah held four catches despite not being the wicket-keeper, and Glamorgan were bowled out for 173 in 35.4 overs, leaving them losers by 111 runs, their heaviest defeat by runs in one-day cricket all season.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{throughout}} {{the early and}} mid 1950s, the Royal Air Force (RAF) had developed an intense desire to advance {{the performance of their}} aircraft; in particular, the service sought new fighter aircraft that would be capable of routinely flying at very high speeds and high altitudes as a long term replacement for its existing inventory of roughly 700 first-generation jet fighters. At the time, there was a perception that Britain was trailing behind in supersonic aircraft design, and there was pressure to correct this. Events such as the Korean War and rapid advances in the fields of supersonic aerodynamics, structures and aero engines by the British aircraft industry had the effect of increasing demand and the potential capabilities of new fighters. In addition to developing improved versions of existing and emerging fighters such as the Hawker Hunter and Gloster Javelin, there was <b>an</b> <b>appetite</b> <b>for</b> even more promising entirely new aircraft.|$|E

[...] They were aware of the [...] "individual suffering and frustration" [...] of the child who was ill-prepared for the demands of school, so they sought to instill in their young viewers <b>an</b> <b>appetite</b> <b>for</b> learning. Two related goals were providing their viewers with basic educational skills, which Lesser insisted was valuable to inner-city parents, and teaching children both what and how to think. [...] The show's creators decided to only include in their curriculum the range of skills of the three to five-year-old child, and not focus on skills they already had, or on skills beyond their reach.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Zelda Sayre was {{extremely}} active. She danced, took ballet lessons {{and enjoyed the}} outdoors. In 1914, Sayre began attending Sidney Lanier High School. She was bright, but uninterested in her lessons. Her work in ballet continued into high school, where she had an active social life. She drank, smoked and {{spent much of her}} time with boys, and she remained a leader in the local youth social scene. A newspaper article about one of her dance performances quoted her as saying that she cared only about [...] "boys and swimming." [...] She developed <b>an</b> <b>appetite</b> <b>for</b> attention, actively seeking to flout convention—whether by dancing the Charleston, or by wearing a tight, flesh-colored bathing suit to fuel rumors that she swam nude. Her father's reputation was something of a safety net, preventing her social ruin, but Southern women of the time were expected to be delicate, docile and accommodating. Consequently, Sayre's antics were shocking to many of those around her, and she became—along with her childhood friend and future Hollywood starlet Tallulah Bankhead—a mainstay of Montgomery gossip.

500|$|A dolphin's diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} small fish, crustaceans, and squid. Although this varies by location, many populations share <b>an</b> <b>appetite</b> <b>for</b> {{fish from the}} mullet, the tuna and mackerel, and the drum and croaker families. Its cone-like teeth serve to grasp, but do not chew food. When they encounter a shoal of fish, they {{work as a team}} to herd them towards the shore to maximize the harvest. They also hunt alone, often targeting bottom-dwelling species. The bottlenose dolphin sometimes hits a fish with its fluke, sometimes knocking it out of the water, using a strategy called [...] "fish whacking". [...] "Strand feeding", is an inherited feeding technique used by bottlenose dolphins near and around coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina. When a pod finds a school of fish, they will circle the school and trap the fish in a mini whirlpool. Then, the dolphins will charge at the school and push their bodies up onto a mud-flat, forcing the fish on the mud-flat, as well. The dolphins then crawl around on their sides, consuming the fish they washed up on shore.|$|E

500|$|Barb Richards, {{director}} of music for WAJI {{said that the}} cast's introduction of new music prompted the station to finally add music from the cast. Richards referenced the 21.9million downloads and 5.2million albums sold since the series since its May2009 premiere, but commented, [...] "Still, I believe {{that people want to}} hear originals over remakes, so up until the 'Glee' cast's original music it didn't make sense for us to play each latest cover, other than to spotlight it the day of the show." [...] However, Richards complimented the original [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] saying its lyrics would [...] "resonate with kids and parents" [...] and said that she liked it when she first heard it and when she saw it on the show. She also commented that it [...] "is good on its own, and having the Glee name on it gives it a leg up". Dave McKay, program director at WPST also echoed Richards' sentiments that the Glee sales were reason to add them to airplay, adding [...] "Not many artists or songs enjoy the type of exposure that 'Glee' provides. Plus, the audience that watches the show is the audience we target, so the fit seems perfect [...] since 'Glee' music sells, there is definitely <b>an</b> <b>appetite</b> <b>for</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|Between 2008 and 2012, {{sociologist}} Sandy To, {{while at}} the University of Cambridge, conducted a 'grounded theory method' study in China regarding the topic. To's research focused on [...] "marriage partner choice" [...] by Chinese professional women {{in the form of}} a typology of four different [...] "partner choice strategies". The main finding of the study found that contrary to the popular belief that highly educated and single women remain unmarried, or do not want to take on traditional roles in marriage, because of personal preference, that in contrast, they commonly have <b>an</b> <b>appetite</b> <b>for</b> marriage and that their main obstacle is traditional patriarchal attitudes. The study also pointed out that in other Asian countries such as Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan, where women have been receiving a higher education, that correspondingly, the average age of marriage amongst them is much higher. The Chinese People's Daily cited a 2012 United Nations survey that found 74 percent of women in the United Kingdom and 70 percent of women in Japan were single between the ages of 25 and 29. The China Daily published an article that cited figures from the 2012 United Nations' World Marriage Data which reported 38% of women in the United States, and more than 50% of women in Britain remained unmarried in their 30s.|$|E

Tony and Matt are great actors, and the fact that they're easy on the eye is a great advantage". [...] "What the brothers bring is romance and fun, because that's something we've been a little short-changed on in EastEnders recently. The Moons are a very interesting family to work with– they're all big characters. It's a great new era for that clan". Kirkwood added that [...] "there is more to the pair than meets the eye" [...] saying that there [...] "are a couple of buried secrets between Eddie and his sons" [...] confirming it will be [...] "a big story for the summer". He finished, [...] "there'll be consequences for all concerned". Kirkwood later added, [...] "What I hope we've created in Tyler and Anthony are blokes you might see in the pub on a Friday night with <b>an</b> <b>appetite</b> <b>for</b> life– and for women." [...] When Anthony was introduced, it was revealed that he was a gambling addict. Of this, Lapinskas said, [...] "it's a great thing that our executive producer Bryan Kirkwood and the EastEnders team came up with for Anthony– that he does have this gambling problem and various insecurities connected with it. It adds some more depth to the character and it's brilliant when we can explore that. With every topic and every storyline that crops up, I think Anthony's background will always have an effect and impact on it. That's really nice to play." ...|$|E

500|$|Sigourney Weaver has {{expressed}} interest in reuniting with Ridley Scott to revive her character for another Alien film. In the 2003 commentary track for the Alien DVD included in the Alien Quadrilogy set, she and Scott both speculated on the possibility, with Weaver stating: [...] "There is <b>an</b> <b>appetite</b> <b>for</b> a fifth one, which is something I never expected...it's really hard {{to come up with}} a fifth story that's new and fresh...but I have wanted to go back into space...I think outer space adventure is a good thing for us right now, 'cause Earth is so grim...so we've been talking about it, but very generally." [...] Scott remarked that, if the series were to continue, the most logical course would be to explore the origins of the space jockey and the Aliens. Weaver supported this idea, saying [...] "I think it would be great to go back, because I'm asked that question so many times: 'Where did the Alien come from?' People really want to know in a very visceral way." [...] David Giler said that he, Walter Hill, and Gordon Carroll, the producers of the first four films in the series, would not be willing to produce another unless it was about the Aliens' homeworld and Weaver was on board (despite the fact that they were among the producers of Alien vs. Predator films). Weaver, in turn, indicated that she would only return to the franchise if either Scott or James Cameron were to direct. Cameron had been working on a story for a fifth Alien film which would explore the origins of the creatures, but ceased work on it when he learned that Fox was pursuing Alien vs. Predator, which he felt would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise".|$|E
