5|$|Hannah {{commanded}} RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, in 1949–50, and saw service {{during the}} Malayan Emergency as senior <b>air</b> <b>staff</b> officer at , Singapore, from 1956 to 1959. His other post-war appointments included Deputy Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> from 1961 to 1965, Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Operational Command from 1965 to 1967, and AOC Support Command from 1968 to 1969. In January 1970, {{he was promoted}} to air marshal and became Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> (CAS), the RAAF's senior position. Knighted in 1971, Hannah concluded his three-year appointment as CAS a year early, in March 1972, to become Governor of Queensland. He attracted controversy in this role after making comments critical of the Federal government of the day, and the British government refused to agree to his term being extended. Hannah retired in March 1977, and died the following year.|$|E
5|$|Hansell drew up the {{tactical}} doctrine, SOPs, {{and the table}} of organization and equipment of the Twentieth Air Force, {{which was to be}} commanded by Arnold personally, including use of AAF <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> as the staff of the Twentieth. In addition to his own <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> duties, Hansell became {{chief of staff of the}} Twentieth Air Force on April 6, 1944. When Arnold was incapacitated by a heart attack in May, Hansell acted as de facto commander of the Twentieth Air Force.|$|E

5|$|On 1 September 1937, Newall was {{appointed}} as Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff,</b> the military {{head of the}} RAF, in succession to Sir Edward Ellington. The promotion was unexpected; of the prospective candidates mooted for the job, Newall has been widely seen by historians as the least gifted. The most prominent candidate was Hugh Dowding, the head of RAF Fighter Command and senior in rank to Newall by three months, who had been informally told by Ellington in 1936 that {{he was expected to}} be appointed as the new Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff.</b> The decision was taken by the Air Minister, Viscount Swinton, without consulting Ellington for advice.|$|E
5|$|The Deputy Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> at the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Bostock was considered a leading candidate for the position of Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> in 1942 but was passed over in favour of Air Commodore George Jones, a friend of twenty years. Appointed Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command soon after, Bostock became involved in a bitter and long-running dispute with Jones {{over control of the}} Air Force in the South West Pacific. Following his retirement from the RAAF in 1946, he became a journalist and later a Federal Member of Parliament.|$|E

5|$|The Deputy Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> {{position}} that Bostock occupied at {{the outbreak of}} World War II was a new one that initially augmented, and later supplanted, an existing Assistant Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> role. Unlike the Assistant Chief, the Deputy {{had the authority to}} act in place of the Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> (CAS) if required. This increased status saw Bostock given a place on Australia's Joint Planning Committee. He was the RAAF's delegate to a defence conference in Singapore in October 1940, where the Australian contingent found the local forces ill-prepared for an attack by the Japanese, and recommended significant increases in air capability, both in Australia and the Pacific Islands, to meet the threat. Bostock rose rapidly in rank during this period, becoming acting air commodore on 1June 1940 and substantive air vice marshal on 1October 1941. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1942 New Year Honours.|$|E
5|$|Air Vice Marshal Joseph Eric (Joe) Hewitt, CBE (13 April 1901– 1November 1985) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). A Royal Australian Navy officer who transferred permanently to the Air Force in 1928, he commanded No.101 (Fleet Cooperation) Flight in the early 1930s, and No.104 (Bomber) Squadron RAF on exchange in Britain shortly before World WarII. Appointed the RAAF's Assistant Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> in 1941, Hewitt was posted the following year to Allied Air Forces Headquarters, South West Pacific Area, as Director of Intelligence. In 1943, he took command of No.9 Operational Group, the RAAF's main mobile strike force, but was controversially sacked by the Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff,</b> Air Vice Marshal George Jones, {{less than a year}} later over alleged morale and disciplinary issues.|$|E
5|$|Among a small {{coterie of}} wartime RAAF commanders {{earmarked}} for further senior roles, McCauley retained his rank of air commodore following {{the cessation of}} hostilities. He served again as Deputy Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> in 1946–47. Promoted to air vice marshal, he was Chief of Staff to Lieutenant General Horace Robertson at British Commonwealth Occupation Force Headquarters in Japan from June 1947 to June 1949. In this post he was preceded and succeeded by two other Duntroon graduates, Air Vice Marshals Frank Bladin and Alan Charlesworth respectively. Upon his return to Australia, McCauley was made Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area. During the Malayan Emergency, he formed RAAF aircraft assigned for deployment into No.90 (Composite) Wing, as directed by Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> Air Marshal George Jones, {{to ensure that they}} would operate with a degree of autonomy rather than be dispersed throughout other Allied groups. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1951 Birthday Honours.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World WarII, Hely {{was attached to the}} operations room at RAF Coastal Command. On his return to Australia in January 1940, he was appointed Staff Officer Plans at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. In October, he joined the Deputy Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff,</b> Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, as a delegate to a defence conference in Singapore. The Australian contingent found the local forces ill-prepared for an attack by the Japanese and recommended significant increases in air capability, both in Australia and the Pacific Islands, to meet the threat. Hely was promoted to temporary wing commander the following January, and was the ranking Air Force delegate at a series of staff talks in Batavia and Singapore regarding the defence of the Dutch East Indies. He became Director of Operations at RAAF Headquarters in August. His promotion to acting group captain was announced on 17February 1942. Two days later, the Japanese bombed Darwin, Northern Territory; Hely circulated a memo early the next month to all commands on the lessons learnt from the raid. He was posted to Darwin in May to join North-Western Area headquarters as senior <b>air</b> <b>staff</b> officer, and was granted the temporary rank of group captain in January 1943. Hely returned to RAAF Headquarters in March to become Director of <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> Plans.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, McCauley again became Deputy Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff.</b> In 1947 he was {{promoted}} to air vice marshal and appointed Chief of Staff at British Commonwealth Occupation Force Headquarters in Japan. Returning to Australia in June 1949, he served as the last Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Eastern Area and the inaugural AOC Home Command (now Air Command). Raised to air marshal, he took up the position of Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> in January 1954, and was knighted a year later. During his tenure in the RAAF's senior role, McCauley focused on potential deployments to Southeast Asia—particularly Vietnam—and threats from the north, commencing redevelopment of RAAF Base Darwin and recommending purchase of a light supersonic bomber to replace the Air Force's English Electric Canberra. After retiring from military life in March 1957, he chaired various community and welfare organisations, serving as Federal President of the Air Force Association for ten years. He died in Sydney in 1989, aged 89.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} doubted that fast fighter {{aircraft}} could engage in dogfights. The g-force {{effect on the}} human body also seemed to suggest the prospect of air-to-air combat between fighters was impractical anyway. The threat they saw related only to the return-fire of the bomber's gunners. Before the war the effectiveness of return, or cross-fire, from bombers had been exaggerated by the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> and Air Ministry.|$|E

5|$|On 21September 1942, Rawlinson {{was posted}} to RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, as an {{assistant}} {{at the office of}} the Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff.</b> There he was asked to lead the only RAAF Supermarine Spitfire squadron to be formed in Australia, No.79 Squadron. Rawlinson married Thora Doreen Buckland, a Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force officer, on 3April 1943.|$|E
5|$|Posted to England as Senior <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> Officer (SASO) of No.38 Group RAF, Bladin {{was closely}} {{involved}} in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of France. He flew a mission on D-Day, 6June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to Normandy, and was mentioned in despatches two days later. Completing his RAF {{service on the}} staff of the Second Tactical Air Force in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become Deputy Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> in October 1944. On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with directives from the Air Board, the RAAF's controlling body, but in the end the Australian government made no change to command arrangements.|$|E

5|$|While {{financial}} backing was issued by NATO's Mutual Weapons Development Program to support {{development of the}} Pegasus engine, the British government were not forthcoming with funding. While HSA chose {{to go ahead with}} the P.1127 as a private venture, the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> disagreed heavily over what requirements should be set out for a future RAF VTOL aircraft; some officers, such as the Chief of the <b>Air</b> <b>Staff</b> Sir Thomas Pike, advocated simplicity while others, such as the RAF operational requirements division, sought various performance demands of such an aircraft, particularly the capacity for supersonic flight. HSA was also interested in the prospects and feasibility of a more sophisticated development of the P.1127, knowing that a supersonic-capable VTOL aircraft would likely be more attractive to customers, there being a general perception at the time that supersonic aircraft held significantly more value their subsonic counterparts.|$|E
