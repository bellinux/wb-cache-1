5|$|In {{the areas}} in which it was endemic, the emu was an {{important}} source of meat to Aboriginal Australians. They used the fat as bush medicine <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> it into their skin. It served as a valuable lubricant, was used to oil wooden tools and utensils such as the coolamon, and was mixed with ochre to make the traditional paint for ceremonial body adornment.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} {{treatment}} for a Myrmecia sting depends on {{the severity of the}} reaction. If no signs of an allergic reaction are seen, an ice pack or commercially available spray is used to relieve the pain. Washing the stung area, stingose, and the use of antihistamine tablets are other methods to reduce the pain. Indigenous Australians use bush remedies to treat Myrmecia stings, such as rubbing the tips of bracken ferns onto the stung area. Carpobrotus glaucescens is also used to treat stung areas, using juices that are squeezed <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> onto the area, which quickly relieves the pain from the sting.|$|E
5|$|When Chandler was 14, {{he began}} {{stealing}} cars and was arrested 20times as a juvenile. As an adult, {{he was charged}} with a variety of crimes, including possession of counterfeit money, loitering and prowling, burglary, kidnapping, and armed robbery. He was also accused of masturbating while peering inside a woman's window. In one incident, Chandler and an accomplice broke into a Florida couple's home, held them at gunpoint, and robbed them. Chandler told his accomplice to tie up the man with speaker wire and took the woman into the bedroom, where he made her strip to her underwear, tied her up, <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> the barrel of his revolver across her stomach.|$|E

5|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{external}} field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose's height, and the {{accuracy}} {{with which he}} bowled, {{made it difficult for}} batsmen to play forward to the ball; instead they were forced to play with their weight going back. His accuracy meant that he was effective if the pitch favoured batsmen. He bowled an effective yorker, and unlike other fast bowlers, used short-pitched deliveries sparingly, although he could bowl a hostile bouncer, and concentrated on bowling a full length aimed at the wickets. Ambrose rarely engaged in verbal sparring with batsmen, although in later years he occasionally inspected the pitch in an area close to the batsman before an innings began <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> his hands to suggest that he would enjoy bowling there. He always aimed to concede as few runs as possible when bowling, and frequently berated himself when he offered an easy delivery from which to score. Following his dismissal of a batsman, Ambrose often celebrated by pumping the air with his fists. With Courtney Walsh, Ambrose developed a reputation for performing at his best when his team seemed likely to lose, and he often took wickets in clusters which devastated the opposition. In addition, he was often most effective against the leading batsmen on a team; he was also capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in the techniques of other batsmen.|$|E

25|$|To print, {{the block}} is fixed firmly on a table. The printer takes a round {{horsehair}} inking brush and applies ink with a vertical motion. The paper is then {{laid on the}} block <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> with a long narrow pad to transfer the impression to the paper. The paper is peeled off and set to dry. Because of the rubbing process, printing is only done {{on one side of}} the paper, and the paper is thinner than in the west, but two pages are normally printed at once.|$|E
25|$|Water {{sensitive}} {{objects are}} masked {{in plastic wrap}} to avoid getting wet. A slurry of precipitated (pharmaceutical grade) calcium carbonate and deionized water is created <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> onto the silver piece with a cotton rag or cotton ball. It is recommended that the slurry be tested on the bottom or in a non-visible area of the silver for abrasiveness. If the slurry is too abrasive it will scratch the surface and increase the potential for future tarnishing. The polish is applied with a soft cloth and polished in a circular motion.|$|E
25|$|The {{craft of}} {{bookbinding}} probably originated in India, where religious sutras were copied on to palm leaves (cut into two, lengthwise) {{with a metal}} stylus. The leaf was then dried <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> with ink, which would form a stain in the wound. The finished leaves were given numbers, and two long twines were threaded through each end through wooden boards, making a palm-leaf book. When the book was closed, the excess twine would be wrapped around the boards to protect the manuscript leaves. Buddhist monks took the idea through Afghanistan to China {{in the first century}} BC.|$|E

He signed with the comedy-oriented independent record label Laff Records in 1970, and in 1971 recorded his second album, Craps (After Hours). Two years later, the relatively unknown comedian appeared in the documentary Wattstax (1972), wherein he riffed on the tragic-comic absurdities of race relations in Watts and the nation. Not long afterward, Pryor sought a deal with a larger label, and he signed with Stax Records in 1973.|$|E
25|$|The first {{electrostatic}} generators {{are called}} friction machines {{because of the}} friction in the generation process. A primitive form of frictional machine was invented around 1663 by Otto von Guericke, using a sulphur globe that could be rotated <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> by hand. It may not actually have been rotated during use and {{was not intended to}} produce electricity (rather cosmic virtues), but inspired many later machines that used rotating globes. Isaac Newton suggested the use of a glass globe instead of a sulphur one. Francis Hauksbee improved the basic design, with his frictional electrical machine that enabled a glass sphere to be rotated rapidly against a woollen cloth.|$|E
500|$|In the 6th century BCE, Charaka Samhita's medical {{treatise}} {{documents the}} onion as a medicinal plant. [...] " [...] diuretic, good for digestion, the heart, the eyes, and the joints." [...] A Greek physician of first century A.D., Dioscorides, also documented the medicinal uses of onions. Eating onions was a tradition to fortify athletes before the Olympic Games. Athletes consumed huge quantities of them, drank onion juice, <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> onions on their bodies.|$|E

500|$|Like many rodents, {{guinea pigs}} {{sometimes}} participate in social grooming, and they regularly self-groom. A milky-white substance is secreted from their eyes <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> into the hair during the grooming process. Groups of boars often chew each other's hair, {{but this is}} a method of establishing hierarchy within a group, rather than a social gesture. Dominance is also established through biting (especially of the ears), piloerection, aggressive noises, head thrusts, and leaping attacks. Non-sexual simulated [...] for dominance is also common among same-sex groups.|$|E
500|$|Ukiyo-e {{prints were}} {{impressed}} on hand-made paper manually, {{rather than by}} mechanical press as in the West. [...] The artist provided an ink drawing on thin paper, which was pasted to a block of cherry wood <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> with oil until the upper layers of paper could be pulled away, leaving a translucent layer of paper that the block-cutter could use as a guide. The block-cutter cut away the non-black areas of the image, leaving raised areas that were inked to leave an impression. [...] The original drawing was destroyed in the process.|$|E
500|$|The job {{of leading}} the foreign {{language}} productions of Hair was given to Bertrand Castelli, Butler's partner and {{executive producer of the}} Broadway show. [...] Castelli was a writer/producer who traveled in Paris art circles <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> elbows with Pablo Picasso and Jean Cocteau. [...] Butler described him as a [...] "crazy showman ... the guy with the business suit and beads". [...] Castelli decided to do the show in the local language of each country at a time when Broadway shows were always done in English. [...] The translations followed the original script closely, and the Broadway stagings were used. [...] Each script contained local references, such as street names and the names or depictions of local politicians and celebrities. [...] Castelli produced companies in France, Germany, Mexico and other countries, sometimes also directing the productions. The first European production opened in Stockholm, Sweden, on September 20, 1968 with a cast including Ulf Brunnberg, , [...] and , produced and directed by [...] and choreographed by Julie Arenal, and ran for 134 performances until March 1969.|$|E

500|$|In early July 1955, Hensley began {{a series}} of {{meetings}} near Altha, Florida. He conducted the meetings without snakes for three weeks, before procuring a [...] snake and bringing it to a Sunday afternoon service on July 24. Several dozen people gathered at an abandoned blacksmith shop for the observance. During the service, Hensley loudly delivered a sermon on the topic of faith. He removed the snake from the lard can in which it was stored, wrapped it around his neck, <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> it on his face. He walked around the audience while preaching and then returned the snake to the can. As he placed the snake into the can, it bit him on his wrist. After a few minutes, Hensley became visibly ill, experiencing severe pain, a discolored arm, and hematemesis. He refused medical attention, although he remained in pain and was urged to seek treatment both by congregants and the Calhoun County Sheriff. One eyewitness claimed that Hensley attributed his suffering to the congregation's lack of faith, although his wife Sally stated that she believed it was the will of God. Hensley died early the next morning. Calhoun County Judge Hannah Gaskin ruled his death a suicide.|$|E
500|$|Temple I (also {{known as}} the Temple of Ah Cacao or Temple of the Great Jaguar) is a funerary pyramid {{dedicated}} to Jasaw Chan K'awil, who was entombed in the structure in AD 734, the pyramid was completed around 740–750. The temple rises [...] high. The massive roofcomb that topped the temple was originally decorated with a giant sculpture of the enthroned king, although little of this decoration survives. The tomb of the king was discovered by Aubrey Trik of the University of Pennsylvania in 1962. Among items recovered from the Late Classic tomb were a large collection of inscribed human and animal bone tubes and strips with sophisticated scenes depicting deities and people, finely carved <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> with vermilion, as well as jade and shell ornaments and ceramic vessels filled with offerings of food and drink. The shrine at {{the summit of the}} pyramid has three chambers, each behind the next, with the doorways spanned by wooden lintels fashioned from multiple beams. The outermost lintel is plain but the two inner lintels were carved, some of the beams were removed in the 19th century and their location is unknown, while others were taken to museums in Europe.|$|E
