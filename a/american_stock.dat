40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{intra-day}} {{patterns on the}} NYSE and AMEX of volatility, trading volume and bid-ask spreads for European and Japanese dually-listed <b>stocks</b> with <b>American</b> <b>stocks</b> of comparable average trading volume and volatility. It is shown that the intra-day patterns for thc;se stocks are remarkably similar even though public information flows differ markedly across these stocks during the trading day. In the early morning, all stocks have higher volatility than later in the day, but this phenomenon is most pronounced for Japanese <b>stocks</b> and affects <b>American</b> <b>stocks</b> the least. We argue that these patterns are consistent with markets reacting to the overnight accumulation of public information but are inconsistent with the view that early morning volatility {{can be attributed to}} monopolistic specialist behavior...|$|R
