50|$|Typically all {{business}} functions {{are required to}} maintain an asset register of their business units. The asset register is required to contain, at a minimum, the following information about the assets: the <b>asset</b> <b>identifier,</b> the asset name, the type and location of assets; {{the name of the}} function and process that uses this asset, the asset owner, custodian and user and the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) ratings of the asset. Organizations can choose to include additional information in the asset register as deemed necessary; for example, IT assets can have IP addresses as part of the asset register.|$|E
50|$|The EPC is {{designed}} {{to meet the needs of}} various industries, while guaranteeing uniqueness for all EPC-compliant tags. Some of the existing GS1 identification keys http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/id_keys (such as the Global Returnable <b>Asset</b> <b>Identifier</b> (GRAI)) already provide for unique identification of individual objects. However, the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) only identifies the product type or stock-keeping unit (SKU) rather than an individual instance of a particular product type. To ensure that an EPC always uniquely identifies an individual physical object, in the case of a GTIN, the EPC is constructed as a serialised Serialised Global Trade Item Number (SGTIN) by combining a GTIN product identifier with a unique serial number.|$|E
5000|$|GRAI {{is one of}} two GS1 keys for asset identification. GRAI is used to {{identify}} returnable assets, the other being the Global Individual <b>Asset</b> <b>Identifier.</b> It is for re-usable packages or transport equipment, such as crates, bread trays, pallets or beer kegs. The GRAI enables returnable assets to be identified by type or individually for tracking or sorting purposes. In simple terms this means an asset that will be sent outside the company that contains, protects or transports physical items and will be used for multiple trips. The GRAI identifies the asset being used for the purpose of tracking its location and return. It can be used for tracking purposes only or as part of a hiring or rental system where companies collaborate on the use of these assets. The GRAI is an identification key that can be used globally {{to identify}} the asset. Detailed information regarding the asset will be recorded in a database and the GRAI is the key that provides the link to that information. It may be produced as a GS1-128 bar code, or held in a GS1 EPC tag or used in a database. It is also a United States Department of Defense-recognized Item Unique Identification (IUID) equivalent, and may be encoded in an IUID-compliant DataMatrix. [...] The function of a GRAI is to provide an identification point which can be used to retrieve information held in a database associated that particular asset. This information can show the asset type and optionally identify the particular asset uniquely if required.|$|E
