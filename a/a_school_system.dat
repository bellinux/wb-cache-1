25|$|Resource poor {{schools around}} the world rely on {{government}} support or on efforts from volunteers and private donations, in order to run effectively. In some countries, whenever the economy is down, the need for volunteers and resources increases greatly. There are many opportunities available in school systems for volunteers.

25|$|Student {{involvement}} {{in the classroom is}} a key part of OBE. Students are expected to do their own learning, so that they gain a full understanding of the material. Increased student involvement allows students to feel responsible for their own learning, and they should learn more through this individual learning. Other aspects of involvement are parental and community, through developing curriculum, or making changes to it. OBE outcomes are meant to be decided upon within <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>system,</b> or at a local level. Parents and community members are asked to give input in order to uphold the standards of education within a community and to ensure that students will be prepared for life after school.|$|E
25|$|Political {{activism}} by youth can {{go unnoticed}} because youth activism often occurs on school grounds {{and away from}} the adult society, but youth often face resistance when forming youth activist groups in schools. As the central beneficiaries of public schools, youth are also advocating for student-led school change and education reform through student activism and meaningful student involvement. There are structural inequalities that keep youth from engaging in political talk and action on school grounds or the public domain. School clubs require an adult adviser to make the club official, further adding to school hierarchies of adult power. While some youth participate in student government, others prefer student unions because they provide a real voice to the students and present it to the administration while student governments do not have the power to effect real change in <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

25|$|American {{public school}} systems, {{especially}} in large metropolitan areas, {{to a large}} extent are still de facto segregated. Whether due to Brown, or due to Congressional action, or due to societal change, the percentage of black students attending majority-black school districts decreased somewhat until the early 1980s, at which point that percentage began to increase. By the late 1990s, the percentage of black students in mostly minority school districts had returned to about what it was in the late 1960s. In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 (2007), the Court held that, if <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>system</b> became racially imbalanced due to social factors other than governmental racism, then the state is not as free to integrate schools as if the state had been at fault for the racial imbalance. This is especially evident in the charter school system where parents of students can pick which schools their children attend based on the amenities provided by that school and the needs of the child. It seems that race is a factor in the choice of charter school.|$|E
500|$|Article 13.2 lists {{a number}} of {{specific}} steps parties are required to pursue to realise the right of education. These include the provision of free, universal and compulsory primary education, [...] "generally available and accessible" [...] secondary education in various forms (including technical and vocational training), and equally accessible higher education. All of these must be available to all without discrimination. Parties must also develop <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>system</b> (though it may be public, private, or mixed), encourage or provide scholarships for disadvantaged groups. Parties are required to make education free at all levels, either immediately or progressively; [...] "rimary education shall be compulsory and available free to all"; secondary education [...] "shall be made generally available and accessible to all by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education"; and [...] "igher education shall be made equally accessible to all, {{on the basis of}} capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education".|$|E
500|$|In Brown v. Board of Education (1954), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled {{segregation}} by race {{in public}} schools to be unconstitutional. In the following fifteen years, the court issued landmark rulings in cases involving race and civil liberties, but left supervision of the desegregation of Southern schools mostly to lower courts. [...] Among other progressive legislation, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VI of which forbids racial discrimination in any program or activity receiving federal funding. By 1968, integration of public schools was well advanced. In that year, the Supreme Court revisited the issue of school desegregation in Green v. County School Board, ruling {{that it was not}} enough to eliminate racially discriminatory practices; state governments were under an obligation to actively work to desegregate schools. The school board in Green had allowed children to attend any school, but few chose to attend those dominated by another race. [...] In 1970, in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, the Supreme Court upheld an order for busing of students to desegregate <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The publicized suicide {{serves as}} a trigger, {{in the absence of}} {{protective}} factors, for the next suicide by a susceptible or suggestible person.

2500|$|Canada's federal {{residential}} school system {{began in the}} mid-1870s, building upon a patchwork of boarding schools established and operated by various Christian denominations. [...] Member of Parliament for Assiniboia West, Nicholas Flood Davin, produced a report, known generally as the Davin Report, that recommended the establishment of <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>system</b> similar to that being created in the United States. [...] One of its chief goals was to remove Aboriginal children from [...] "the influence of the wigwam", which he claimed was stronger than that of existing day schools, and keep them instead [...] "constantly within the circle of civilized conditions". [...] While {{the history of the}} Indian Residential School (IRS) system is a checkered one, much criticism has been levelled at both the system and those who established and supported it. Neglect and poor nutrition were often what Aboriginal children experienced, particularly {{in the early decades of}} the system's operation. [...] The stripping away of traditional native culture—sometimes referred to as [...] "cultural genocide"—is another charge levelled at the {{residential school}}s. In many schools, students were not allowed to speak their Indigenous languages or practice any of their own customs, and thus lost their sense of identity, inevitably driving a cultural wedge between children and their family.|$|E
2500|$|Yaroslav, {{known as}} [...] "the Wise", {{struggled}} for power with his brothers. A son of Vladimir the Great, he was vice-regent of Novgorod {{at the time}} of his father's death in 1015. Subsequently, his eldest surviving brother, Svyatopolk the Accursed, killed three of his other brothers and seized power in Kiev. Yaroslav, with the active support of the Novgorodians and the help of Viking mercenaries, defeated Svyatopolk and became the grand prince of Kiev in 1019. Although he first established his rule over Kiev in 1019, he did not have uncontested rule of all of Kievan Rus' until 1036. Like Vladimir, Yaroslav was eager to improve relations with the rest of Europe, especially the Byzantine Empire. Yaroslav's granddaughter, Eupraxia the daughter of his son Vsevolod I, Prince of Kiev, was married to Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor. Yaroslav also arranged marriages for his sister and three daughters to the kings of Poland, France, Hungary and Norway. Yaroslav promulgated the first East Slavic law code, Russkaya Pravda; built Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev and Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod; patronized local clergy and monasticism; and is said to have founded <b>a</b> <b>school</b> <b>system.</b> Yaroslav's sons developed the great Kiev Pechersk Lavra (monastery), which functioned in Kievan Rus' as an ecclesiastical academy.|$|E
