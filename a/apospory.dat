5000|$|In a wide sense, {{methods of}} {{vegetative}} propagation include cutting, vegetative apomixis, layering, division, budding, grafting and tissue culture. Cutting {{is the most}} common artificial vegetative propagation method, where pieces of the [...] "parent" [...] plant are removed and placed in a suitable environment so that they can grow into a whole new plant, the [...] "clone", which is genetically identical to the parent. Cutting exploits the ability of plants to grow adventitious roots (i.e. root material that can generate from a location other than the existing or primary root system, as in from a leaf or cut stem) under certain conditions.Vegetative propagation is usually considered a cloning method. However, there are several cases where vegetatively propagated plants are not genetically identical. Root cuttings of thornless blackberries will revert to thorny type because the adventitious shoot develops from a cell that is genetically thorny. Thornless blackberry is a chimera, with the epidermal layers genetically thornless but the tissue beneath it genetically thorny. Similarly, leaf cutting propagation of certain chimeral variegated plants, such as snake plant (Sansevieria trifasciata), will produce mainly nonvariegated plants.Grafting is often not a complete cloning method because seedlings are used as rootstocks. In that case only the top of the plant is clonal. In some crops, particularly apples, the rootstocks are vegetatively propagated so the entire graft can be clonal if the scion and rootstock are both clones.Apomixis (including <b>apospory</b> and diplospory) is a type of reproduction that does not involve fertilisation. In flowering plants, unfertilized seeds are involved, or plantlets that grow instead of flowers. Hawkweed (Hieracium), dandelion (Taraxacum), some citrus (Citrus) and many grasses such as Kentucky blue grass (Poa pratensis) all use this form of asexual reproduction. Bulbils are sometimes formed instead of the flowers of garlic.|$|E
40|$|The {{genetic control}} of {{apomixis}} was studied in numerous segregating progenies originated from intercrossing and selfing of obligate sexual and facultative apomictic parents in Poa pratensis {{by means of}} the flow cytometric seed screen. The data support a novel model with five major genes required to control asexual seed formation: the <b>Apospory</b> initiator (Ait) gene, the <b>Apospory</b> preventer (Apv) gene, a Megaspore development (Mdv) gene, the Parthenogenesis initiator (Pit) gene, and the Parthenogenesis preventer (Ppv) gene. Differences in expressivity and interactions of these genes are responsible for the wide variation of the mode of reproduction. <b>Apospory</b> and parthenogenesis as well as the initiator and preventer genes of these components segregate independently. The genotypes with the highest expressivity of <b>apospory</b> and parthenogenesis were assigned as Ait-/apvapv/Pit-/ppvppv, those with intermediate expressivity as Ait-/Apv-/Pit-/Ppv-, and those with low expressivity as aitait/apvapv/pitpit/ppvppv. Among the self progenies of obligate sexual individuals, plants with a low capacity for <b>apospory</b> and/or parthenogenesis occurred, indicating that the sexual parents were heterozygous for the preventer genes and homozygous for the recessive initiator alleles (aitait/Apv-/pitpit/Ppv-). The dominant allele Ait exhibits incomplete penetrance. The degree of expressivity of <b>apospory</b> and parthenogenesis was constant among several harvest years of F 1 plants...|$|E

About half of the F 1 progeny plants were parthenogenic, as adjudicated by an auxin test. The degree of parthenogenesis ranged from 1. 44 % to 92. 9 %. <b>Apospory</b> was detected in parthenoge- netic plants as well as in two non-parthenogenetic indi- viduals.

40|$|In land plants, two {{distinct}} generations, gametophyte and sporophyte, alternate {{to complete the}} life cycle. Sporophytes undergo meiosis to produce spores, from which gametophytes develop. Gametophytes produce gametes, which participate in fertilization to produce the zygote, the first cell of the sporophyte generation. In addition to this sexual reproduction pathway, some fern species can undergo <b>apospory</b> or apogamy, processes that bypass meiosis or fertilization, respectively, to alternate between the two generations without changing the chromosome number. <b>Apospory</b> is inducible in the laboratory in various fern species simply by altering the sugar level in the media. In sporophytes induced to undergo <b>apospory,</b> sporophyte regeneration is also observed. The ratio of aposporous gametophytes to regenerated sporophytes varies, {{in a manner consistent}} with being dependent on sugar level. Whereas the sugar signaling pathway is yet to be elucidated in lower plants, in angiosperms it has been shown to play a regulatory role in controlling essential processes including flowering and embryo development, which give rise to the gametophyte and the next sporophyte generation, respectively. Here, we present evidence for the role of different sugar levels on the balance of <b>apospory</b> and regeneration in the fern Ceratopteris richardii. The demonstration of crosstalk between sugar signaling and the hormone ethylene signaling in angiosperms prompted us to test the effects of this hormone in combination with sugar on <b>apospory</b> vs. regeneration. These results provide insight into how a group of redifferentiating cells determines which generation to become and lay the groundwork for further analysis of this asexual pathway...|$|E

Gametophytic apomixis, asexual reproduction involving megagametophytes, occurs in many flowering-plant families and as several variant mechanisms. Developmental destabilization of sexual reproduction {{as a result}} of hybridization and/or polyploidy appears to be a general trigger for its evolution, but the evidence is complicated by ploidy-level changes and hybridization occurring with facultative apomixis. The repeated origins of polyploid apomictic complexes in the palaeopolyploid Maloid Rosaceae suggest a new model of evolutionary transitions that may have wider applicability. Two conjectures are fundamental to this model: (1) that as previously suggested by Rutishauser, like many sexual flowering plants the polyploid apomicts require maternal– paternal balance in the second fertilization event that gives rise to the endosperm, and (2) 2 that the observed variation in endosperm ploidy levels relates less to flexibility late in development than to the known variation in developmental origin of the megagametophyte between mechanisms loosely categorized as diplospory and <b>apospory.</b> The model suggests explanations for the relative frequencies of <b>apospory</b> and diplospory, and for the wide but incomplete associations of <b>apospory</b> with a pollination requirement (pseudogamy) and of diplospory with autonomous development of the endosperm.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of apomixis – seed formation without fertilization – into crop plants is a long-held goal of breeding research, {{since it would}} allow for the ready fixation of heterozygosity. The genetic basis of apomixis, whether of the aposporous or the diplosporous type, is still only poorly understood. Hypericum perforatum (St John’s wort), a plant with a small genome and a short generation time, can be aposporous and/or parthenogenetic, and so represents an interesting model dicot for apomixis research. Here we describe a genetic analysis which first defined and then isolated a locus (designated HAPPY for Hypericum <b>APOSPORY)</b> associated with <b>apospory.</b> Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) profiling was used to generate a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker for HAPPY which co-segregated with <b>apospory</b> but not with parthenogenesis, showing that these two components of apomixis are independently controlled. <b>Apospory</b> was inherited as a dominant simplex gene at the tetraploid level. Part of the HAPPY sequence is homologous to the Arabidopsis thaliana gene ARI 7 encoding the ring finger protein ARIADNE 7. This protein is predicted {{to be involved in}} various regulatory processes, including ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. While the aposporous and sexual alleles of the HAPPY component HpARI were co-expressed {{in many parts of the}} plant, the gene product of the apomict’s allele is truncated.

40|$|Twelve {{molecular}} markers {{linked to}} pseudogamous <b>apospory,</b> {{a form of}} gametophytic apomixis, were previously isolated from Pennisetum squamulatum Fresen. No recombination between these markers {{was found in a}} segregating population of 397 individuals (Ozias-Akins et al., 1998, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 95, 5127 ± 5132). The objective {{of the present study was}} to test if these markers were also linked to the aposporous mode of reproduction in two small segregating populations of Cenchrus ciliaris (= Pennisetum ciliare (L.) Link), another apomictic grass species. Among 12 markers (sequence characterized ampli®ed regions, SCARs), six were scored as dominant markers between aposporous and sexual C. ciliaris genotypes (presence/ absence, respectively). Five were always linked to <b>apospory</b> and one showed a low level of recombination in 84 progenies. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were observed between sexual and apomictic phenotypes for three of the six remaining SCARs from P. squamulatum when used as probes. No recombination was observed in the F 1 progenies. Preliminary data from megabase DNA analysis and sequencing in both species indicate that an apospory-speci®c genomic region (ASGR) is highly conserved between the two species. Although C. ciliaris has a smaller genome size to P. squamulatum, a higher copy number for markers linked to <b>apospory</b> found in the former may impair the progress of positional cloning of gene(s) for apomixis in this species...|$|E
40|$|Hybrids lose heterotic yield {{advantage}} when multiplied sexually via meiosis. A potential alternative breeding {{system for}} hybrids is <b>apospory,</b> where female gametes develop without meiosis. Common among grasses, <b>apospory</b> {{begins in the}} nucellus, where aposporous initials (AIs) appear near the sexual megaspore mother cell (MeMC). The cellular origin of AIs is obscure, but one possibility, suggested by the mac 1 and msp 1 mutants of maize and rice, is that AIs are apomeiotic derivatives of the additional MeMCs that appear when genetic control over sporocyte numbers is relaxed. MULTIPLE SPOROCYTES 1 (MSP 1) encodes a leucine-rich-repeat receptor kinase, which is orthologous to EXS/EMS 1 in Arabidopsis. Like mac 1 and msp 1, exs/ems 1 mutants produce extra sporocytes in the anther instead of a tapetum, causing male sterility. This phenotype is copied in mutants of TAPETUM DETERMINANT 1 (TPD 1), which encodes a small protein hypothesized to be an extracellular ligand of EXS/EMS 1. Here we show that rice contains two TPD 1 -like genes, OsTDL 1 A and OsTDL 1 B. Both are co-expressed with MSP 1 in anthers during meiosis, but only OsTDL 1 A and MSP 1 are co-expressed in the ovule. OsTDL 1 A binds to the leucine-rich-repeat domain of MSP 1 in yeast two-hybrid assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation in onion cells; OsTDL 1 B lacks this capacity. When driven by the maize Ubiquitin 1 promoter, RNA interference against OsTDL 1 A phenocopies msp 1 in the ovule {{but not in the}} anther. Thus, RNAi produces multiple MeMCs without causing male sterility. We conclude that OsTDL 1 A binds MSP 1 in order to limit sporocyte numbers. OsTDL 1 A-RNAi lines may be suitable starting points for achieving synthetic <b>apospory</b> in rice...|$|E
40|$|Apomixis or asexual seed {{formation}} in Hieracium praealtum (Asteraceae) {{is controlled by}} two independent dominant loci. One of these, the LOSS OF APOMEIOSIS (LOA) locus, controls apomixis initiation, mitotic embryo sac formation (<b>apospory)</b> and suppression of the sexual pathway. The LOA locus is found {{near the end of}} a hemizygous chromosome surrounded by extensive repeats extending along the chromosome arm. Similar apomixis-carrying chromosome structures have been found in some apomictic grasses, suggesting that the extensive repetitive sequences may be functionally relevant to apomixis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to examine chromosomes of apomeiosis deletion mutants and rare recombinants in the critical LOA region arising from a cross between sexual Hieracium pilosella and apomictic H.  praealtum. The combined analyses of aposporous and nonaposporous recombinant progeny and chromosomal karyotypes were used to determine that the functional LOA locus can be genetically separated from the very extensive repeat regions found on the LOA-carrying chromosome. The large-scale repetitive sequences associated with the LOA locus in H.  praealtum are not essential for <b>apospory</b> or suppression of sexual megasporogenesis (female meiosis).

The objective of this work was to sequence these markers, obtain their flanking regions by chromosome walking and perform an in silico mapping analysis in rice and maize. The methylation status of two apospory-related sequences was also assessed using methylation-sensitive RFLP experiments. Fourteen molecular markers were analyzed and several protein-coding sequences were identified. Copy number estimates and RFLP linkage analysis showed that the sequence PnMAI 3 displayed 2 - 4 copies per genome and linkage to <b>apospory.</b> Extension of this marker by chromosome walking revealed an additional protein-coding sequence mapping in silico in the apospory-syntenic regions of rice and maize. Approximately 5 kb corresponding to different markers were characterized through the global sequencing procedure. A more refined analysis based on sequence information indicated synteny with segments of chromosomes 2 and 12 of rice and chromosomes 3 and 5 of maize.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Details of apomixis at levels of the gene, chromosome, and genome can be obtained with a comprehensive restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) linkage map. The objective of this research was construction of a genetic linkage map of buffelgrass to investigate the molecular basis of <b>apospory</b> and serve as a framework map for marker-facilitated breeding of perennial forage grasses. Buffelgrass (Pennisetum ciliare (L.) Link syn. Cenchrus ciliaris L.) (2 n= 4 x= 36), a highly polymorphic, atomistic, perennial forage grass with rare sexual genotypes and typical meiotic behavior, is well-suited for linkage analyses. Four hundred forty-three homologous probes from an apomictic pistil-specific cDNA library were evaluated and combined with 862 previously analyzed heterologous probes from across the Poaceae. The homologous and heterologous sources yielded 360 and 100 polymorphic probes, respectively, which were mapped in 86 F? hybrid progeny. The female parent's map included 409 single-dose restriction fragments (SDRFs), 47 linkage groups, and 3464 centi-Morgans (cM), while the male parent's map contained 300 SDRFs, 42 linkage groups, and 2757 cM. Approximately 70 - 80 % of the buffelgrass genome was covered, and average marker spacings on the respective maps were 10. 8 and 11. 1 cM. Repulsion-phase linkages were found in 47 % of the linkage groups, implying significant preferential chromosome pairing in buffelgrass. Comparison of interval lengths in the maps bounded by markers heterozygous in both parents revealed less meiotic recombination in the gametes of the male parent. No marker associations to inflorescence type or rhizomes were detected in this small population, but two homologous probes were tightly linked to <b>apospory.</b> The apomixis linkage group was in repulsion with a single linkage group, suggesting disomic inheritance of <b>apospory</b> in buffelgrass...|$|E
40|$|Mendel used hawkweeds {{and other}} plants to verify the laws of {{inheritance}} he discovered using Pisum. Trait segregation was not evident in hawkweeds because many form seeds asexually by apomixis. Meiosis does not occur during female gametophyte formation and the mitotically formed embryo sacs do not require fertilization for seed development. The resulting progeny retain a maternal genotype. Hawkweeds in Hieracium subgenus Pilosella form mitotic embryo sacs by <b>apospory.</b> The initiation of sexual reproduction is required to stimulate <b>apospory</b> in ovules and to promote {{the function of the}} dominant locus, LOSS OF APOMEIOSIS, which stimulates the differentiation of somatic aposporous initial (AI) cells near sexually programmed cells. As AI cells undergo nuclear mitosis the sexual pathway terminates. The function of the dominant locus LOSS OF PARTHENOGENESIS in aposporous embryo sacs enables fertilization-independent embryo and endosperm development. Deletion of either locus results in partial reversion to sexual reproduction, and loss of function in both loci results in reversion to sexual development. In these apomicts, sexual reproduction is therefore the default reproductive mode upon which apomixis is superimposed. These loci are unlikely to encode factors critical for sexual reproduction but might recruit the sexual pathway to enable apomixis. Incomplete functional penetrance of these dominant loci is likely to lead to the generation of rare sexual progeny also derived from these facultative apomicts...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCampuloclinium macrocephalum (Less.) DC. is a {{perennial}} herb widely {{distributed in the}} New World, but introduced to South Africa, where it is commonly called “pompom weed”. This species {{is considered one of}} the most important weeds from Brazil and it has been included among the plant invaders of South Africa. Results of the meiotic and embryological analyses of six populations of C. macrocephalum are reported in this paper. The microsporogenesis analysis revealed five triploid (2 n= 3 x= 30) and one diploid (2 n= 2 x= 20) populations with a basic chromosome number x= 10. The diploid specimens showed regular meiotic behavior, but the triploid plants presented irregular chromosome pairing which result in the formation of univalents, bivalents and trivalents at diakinesis. In consequence, laggard chromosomes, unbalanced nuclei and micronuclei were observed in subsequent phases of meiosis. The embryological analysis showed that the triploid specimens of C. macrocephalum have embryo sac development from a nucellar cell (<b>apospory),</b> which indicates that these specimens are apomictic. Almost all cases of apomixis found in tribe Eupatorieae are diplosporous apomixis. Campuloclinium macrocephalum constitutes the second species of the tribe and the first of the genus with <b>apospory</b> as reproductive system. The aposporous apomixis combined with the presence of xylopodium would be two important factors responsible for the invasiveness of C. macrocephalum...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to sexual reproduction, apomixis bypasses meiosis and egg cell fertilization. Gametophytic apomixis occurs with the parthenogenetic development of unreduced egg cells from apomeiotic embryo sacs originating from a nucellar somatic cell (<b>apospory)</b> or a megaspore mother cell with no, or modified, meiosis (diplospory). Apomeiosis, along with parthenogenesis, excludes segregation and recombination during meiosis and fertilization. Thus, understanding the genetic {{control and the}} molecular mechanisms underlying apomeiosis is critical for the comprehension of apomixis as a whole. In this paper we review the available data on <b>apospory</b> in the facultative apomictic species Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) and on diplospory in reproductive mutants of the sexual species alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Our recent acquisitions on candidate genes for apomeiosis are reported and strategies for elucidating the inheritance of this trait by means of genomics and expression studies are presented and discussed. In particular, experimental data focus on PpSERK and MsMob 1 genes. We document that PpSERK transcripts are specifically expressed in the megaspore mother cells of sexual genotypes and in the aposporic initials of sexual genotypes, suggesting that PpSERK {{plays a role in}} early stages of embryo sac development. Moreover, the altered expression of MsMob 1 in ovules of a reproductive mutant producing diplosporic eggs is reported, and the implication of MsMob 1 proteins in programmed cell death of meiotic megaspores is also considered...|$|E

40|$|Apomixis, as {{it exists}} in Kentucky {{bluegrass}} (Poa pra-tensis L.), is a nearly ideal way of maintaining superior hybrids and complex traits. It combines the genetic advantages of vegetative propagation (maintenance of the genotype) with the agronomic advantages of sexual reproduction (use of the seed). Lack of knowledge on its inheritance at present hinders attempts to manipulate and transfer the apomic-tic trait beyond natural sexual barriers. We analyzed the occurrence of meiotic (haploid) and aposporic (diploid) parthenogenesis in P. praten-sisgenotypes with contrasting degrees of apomixis using embryo rescue and in vitroculture techniques. The in vitrorescue of autonomous embryos obtained after auxin-induced parthenocarpy permitted us to investigate and establish the embryological derivation of progeny plants of certain parthenogenetic origin. All recovered plants were characterized both for chromosome number and DNA fingerprint to ascertain their genetic origin. Our experiments indicated that parthenogenetic capacity is preferentially expressed by aposporic egg cells and so the genetic determinants for apomixis seem to be closely linked and inherited together. We also documented parthenogenetic development of meiotic egg cells. In a highly sexual genotype that when auxin tested showed considerable parthenogenetic capacity, the egg cells appeared to exert this potential irrespective of their cytological origin. Thus, events of segregation of <b>apospory</b> from parthenogenesis are rare, but possible. Although the question remains open, apomixis {{seems to be the}} result of a few tightly clustered genes rather than the combination of two processes, <b>apospory</b> and parthenogenesis, determined by independent genetic factors...|$|E

40|$|Apomixis is {{a mode of}} asexual {{reproduction}} through seed. Progeny produced by apomixis are clonal replicas of a mother plant. The essential feature of apomixis is that embryo sacs and embryos are produced in ovules without meiotic reduction or egg cell fertilisation. Thus, apomixis fixes successful gene combinations and propagates high fitness genotypes across generations. A more profound knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate reproductive events in plants would contribute fundamentally to understanding the evolution and genetic control of apomixis. Molecular markers {{were used to determine}} levels of genetic variation within and relationship among ecotypes of the facultative apomict Hypericum	perforatum	L. (2 n= 4 x= 32). 	All ecotypes were polyclonal, being not dominated by a single genotype, and characterised by different levels of differentiation among multilocus genotypes. Flow cytometric analysis of seeds indicated that all ecotypes were facultatively apomictic, with varying degrees of apomixis and sexuality. Seeds set by haploid parthenogenesis and/or by fertilisation of aposporic egg cells were detected in most populations. The occurrence of both dihaploids and hexaploids indicates that <b>apospory</b> and parthenogenesis may be developmentally uncoupled and supports two distinct genetic factors controlling <b>apospory</b> and parthenogenesis in this species. Cyto-embryological analysis showed that meiotic and aposporic processes do initiate within the same ovule: the aposporic initial often appeared evident at the time of megaspore mother cell differentiation. Our observations suggest that the egg cell exists in an active metabolic state before pollination, and that its parthenogenetic activation leading to embryo formation may occur before fertilisation and endosperm initiation...|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} {{relating to}} apomixis in {{members of the}} Gramineae is reviewed, particularly {{as it relates to}} the types of mechanisms found and to the occurrence of apomixis in the different systematic divisions of the family. Apomixis is more prevalent in the Subfamily Panicoideae than in the Pooideae, and the course of development of the unreduced embryo sac is distinctive in the two subfamilies. Throughout the grasses somatic <b>apospory</b> predominates over gonial <b>apospory,</b> and pseudogamy is much more prevalent than non-pseudogamy. In Cortaderia jubata the spore mother cell (or its derivatives) degenerate and nucellar cells develop as somatic embryo sacs. These follow a course of development similar to the Hieracium type. The synergid develops a prominent haustorium which usually protrudes beyond the micropyle. No functional pollen forms and embryogenesis begins well before anthesis. The species is, therefore, non-pseudogamous. Since no other non-pseudogamous grass also exhibits somatic <b>apospory</b> the situation in Cortaderia would appear to be unique among apomictic grasses. The sexual species of this genus are gynodioecious and exhibit a Polygonum type, 8 -nucleate, 7 -celled embryo sac, which the polar nuclei fuse at or near fertilization and the two synergids develop haustorial extensions through the micropyle during the organisation of the megagametophyte. The structure of the component cells of the somatic embryo sac is described at the ultrastructural level and compared with published accounts. The progress of nucellar degeneration is discussed, and its association with dilatations of the nuclear envelope is noted. A deeply lobed nucleus which is intimately associated with both the apomictic egg and the synergid is characteristic of the central cell. Wall ingrowths of transfer-cell type appear during the organization of the somatic embryo sac and occur all over the central cell, except adjacent to the antipodal cells. Sexual species of Cortaderia also show this feature prior to fertilization. The structure of the haustorium and synergid is described and their role in nutrient uptake and transport is discussed in the light of their morphology. Antipodal cells appear also to be adapted to a nutritional function. The formation walls between the coenocytic endosperm cells follows the pattern already described for this tissue, but wall formation between the cells of the megagametophyte follows a distinctive course. A preliminary account is given of the ultrastructure of the cells of the young globular embryo and the unusual presence of layers of dilated endoplasmic reticulum cisternae in the suspensor is recorded.

The following characters were estimated at the individual level: number of ovules and primary pollen grains per plant, pollen viability, pollen-ovule ratio, number of achenes per plant and their germinability, seed-ovule ratio. Most of data characteristic of reproductive strategy were calculated according to the formulae proposed by Urbańska (1989, 1990). Apomictic cytotypes have both a significantly lower pollen viability and seed-ovule ratio (the lowest values in triploids) than sexual diploids...|$|E
40|$|Twenty embryo sacs {{from each}} of 20 different  Lantana camara L. cultivars {{naturalized}} in South Africa were examined. The normal sexual embryo sacs were monosporic 8 -nucleated embryo sacs of the polygonum type and were encountered in 55 % of the material examined. Several deviations from this pattern were recorded. Occasionally one of the nuclei failed to develop into a synergid, resulting in three polar nuclei. Contrary to published information, the antipodal cells did not increase in size, nor was there {{an increase in the}} number of nuclei per cell. Although the occurrence of sexuality is confirmed, no definite evidence exists for the occurrence of apomixis. The occurrence of two embryo sacs per locule might be the result of either <b>apospory</b> or of sexuality whereby two embryo sacs were formed from two megaspores. </p...|$|E
40|$|Apomixis is an asexual mode of {{reproduction}} through the seed {{that results in}} maternal offspring. A female sterile mutant in pearl millet was identified previously as having apomictic characteristics. The objectives {{of this study were}} to observe the cytology of female sterile ovules after pollination to determine possible reasons for sterility and a possible link to the aposporous apomictic developmental process. Cytological examination of 273 ovules revealed that they are small and deformed; 50 % failed to form embryo sacs, and 35 % formed multiple embryo sacs, which indicates the potential for <b>apospory.</b> Only 12 % contained antipodal cells typical of sexual embryo sacs. In general, the embryo sacs occupied most of the ovule area limiting the amount of nucellar tissue available for endosperm and embryo development. Only six of the 273 ovaries observed had endosperm and/or proembryo development. This recessive mutation represents a possible step in the genetic regulation of apomictic devel-opment. Apomixis may be defined as a develop-mental process that results in vegetativ...|$|E
40|$|In cassava, {{apomixis}} fixes heterosis and avoids {{transmission of}} systemic pathogens which complicate vegetative propagation of the crop. Acombination of evidence from maternal inheritance of RAPDmarkers {{and the structure}} of the embryonic sac in large progeny sets of two distinct genotypes have further confirmed the occurrence of apomixis in cassava. We could advance further on earlier reports of the detection of apomixis in four ways: (1) we could arrive at an estimate of the rate of facultative apomixis in the range of 2 %; (2) we detected the occurrence of apomixis in a second genotype, derived from a different interspecific cross; (3) apomictic behavior was demonstrated in an F 1 individual and (4) parallel embryonic evidence was generated that corroborate the potential occurrence of apomixis by <b>apospory.</b> The fact that apomixis was detected in an F 1 interspecific hybrid hints to the possibility of directly transferring genes for apomixis from a wild relative to cultivated cassava...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Apomixis, asexual seed {{production}} in plants, holds {{great potential for}} agriculture {{as a means to}} fix hybrid vigor. <b>Apospory</b> is a form of apomixis where the embryo develops from an unreduced egg that is derived from a somatic nucellar cell, the aposporous initial, via mitosis. Understanding the molecular mechanism regulating aposporous initial specification will be a critical step toward elucidation of apomixis and also provide insight into developmental regulation and downstream signaling that results in apomixis. To discover candidate transcripts for regulating aposporous initial specification in P. squamulatum, we compared two transcriptomes derived from microdissected ovules at the stage of aposporous initial formation between the apomictic donor parent, P. squamulatum (accession PS 26), and an apomictic derived backcross 8 (BC 8) line containing only the Apospory-Specific Genomic Region (ASGR) -carrier chromosome from P. squamulatum. Toward this end, two transcriptomes derived from ovules of an apomictic donor parent and its apomictic backcross derivative at the stage of <b>apospory</b> initiation, were sequenced using 454 -FLX technology. Results Using 454 -FLX technology, we generated 332, 567 reads with an average read length of 147 base pairs (bp) for the PS 26 ovule transcriptome library and 363, 637 reads with an average read length of 142 bp for the BC 8 ovule transcriptome library. A total of 33, 977 contigs from the PS 26 ovule transcriptome library and 26, 576 contigs from the BC 8 ovule transcriptome library were assembled using the Multifunctional Inertial Reference Assembly program. Using stringent in silico parameters, 61 transcripts were predicted to map to the ASGR-carrier chromosome, of which 49 transcripts were verified as ASGR-carrier chromosome specific. One of the alien expressed genes could be assigned as tightly linked to the ASGR by screening of apomictic and sexual F 1 s. Only one transcript, which did not map to the ASGR, showed expression primarily in reproductive tissue. Conclusions Our results suggest that a strategy of comparative sequencing of transcriptomes between donor parent and backcross lines containing an alien chromosome of interest can be an efficient method of identifying transcripts derived from an alien chromosome in a chromosome addition line. </p...|$|E
40|$|Chromosome {{numbers for}} 88 plants of Picris hieracioides s. l. {{originating}} from 32 localities from Austria, Andorra, Croatia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Slovakia and Spain are reported. All analysed plants were diploid, with 2 n= 2 x= 10. In addition to P. hieracioides s. l., {{we also found}} diploidy (2 n= 2 x= 10) in P. nuristanica from Kirgizia and P. japonica from Japan. Our data confirmed previously published results in the literature. We also studied the mode of reproduction in all three taxa. Picris nuristanica and P. japonica s. l. were able to produce some seeds by selfing, {{and this is the}} first record of autogamy in this genus. In P. hieracioides s. l. only strict allogamy was found, demonstrating the presence of a self-incompatibility system in this species. Because apomixis, namely <b>apospory,</b> has previously been reported in P. hieracioides, castration experiments were performed in order to confirm or reject this report. However, no evidence of apomictic seed formation was found within this species. In the light of our results, P. hieracioides should be considered a strictly sexual taxon...|$|E
40|$|The haploid gametophytes of the fern Ceratopteris richardii are {{autotrophic}} {{and develop}} {{independently of the}} diploid sporophyte plant. While haploid genetics is useful for screening and characterizing mutations affecting gametophyte development in Ceratopteris, {{it is difficult to}} assess whether a gametophytic mutation is dominant or recessive or to determine allelism by complementation analysis in a haploid organism. This report describes how <b>apospory</b> can be used to produce genetically marked polyploid sporophytes whose gametophyte progeny are heterozygous for mutations affecting sex determination in the gametophyte and a known recessive mutation affecting the phenotype of both the gametophyte and sporophyte. The segregation ratios of wild-type to mutant phenotypes in the gametophyte progeny of polyploid sporophyte plants indicate that all of the mutations examined are recessive. The presence of many multivalents and few univalents in meiotic chromosome preparations of spore mother cells confirm that the sporophyte plants assayed are polyploid. The DNA content of the sperm of their progeny gametophytes was also found to be approximately twice that of sperm from wild-type haploid gametophytes...|$|E
40|$|St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum L., 2 n = 4 x = 32) is a {{medicinal}} plant that produces pharmaceutically important metabolites with antidepressive, anticancer and antiviral activities. It is also {{regarded as a}} serious weed in many countries. Wild populations are composed of diploid sexual or polyploid (mostly tetraploid) pseudogamous facultative apomicts. Recent {{research has shown that}} H. perforatum is an attractive model system for the study of apomixis, as it is characterized by a relatively small genome size, a versatile mode of reproduction ranging from complete sexuality to nearly obligate apomixis, and a relatively short generation time. A better understanding of its reproductive and inheritance patterns is required to facilitate the identification of factors associated with apomixis, if these traits are to ever benefit agriculture. This paper reviews the cyto-embryological, molecular and ecological data which have been collected to elucidate apomixis in St. John’s wort, and includes an overview of the main tools which have been and are being used to investigate <b>apospory,</b> parthenogenesis and apomixis within this system...|$|E
