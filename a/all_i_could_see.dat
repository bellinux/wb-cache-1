500|$|Although he {{occasionally}} downplayed his own contribution to literature, Creangă himself {{was aware that}} his texts went beyond records of popular tradition, and made significant efforts {{to be recognized as}} an original author (by corresponding with fellow writers and willingly submitting his books to critical scrutiny). Vianu commented at length on the exact relationship between the narrative borrowed from oral tradition and Creangă's [...] "somewhat surreptitious" [...] method of blending his own style into the folkloric standard, likening it to the historical process whereby local painters improvised over the strict canons of Byzantine art. Creangă's complex take on individuality and the art of writing was attested by the his own foreword to an edition of his collected stories, in which he addressed the reader directly: [...] "You may have read many stupid things since you were put on this Earth. Please read these as well, and where it should be that they don't agree with you, take hold of a pen and come up with something better, for this is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> myself doing and did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Suddenly, Comdr. Carpenter hollered, [...] "Hard left rudder." [...] I {{reversed}} the rudder, but the momentum was still carrying {{the ship to}} the right. The ship shuddered for several seconds and slowly started to turn left when an immense explosion took place. I glanced out the porthole and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was a huge cloud in the direction the Juneau had been.|$|E
2500|$|Arizona's Governor Janet Napolitano {{visited the}} {{area at the}} time of the fire. [...] "This is a big, major fire, and it {{concerns}} us all," [...] she said. Regarding her aerial tour, the governor said, [...] "The fire looks a lot better today than it did a week ago. I flew over Mount Graham on July 4 and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was smoke. Now, I can clearly see the perimeters the firefighters have been burning." [...] Napolitano provided for inmate wildland fire crews to provide fire suppression and forest thinning services.|$|E
6000|$|I {{followed}} cautiously; but, although I groped {{about in}} <b>all</b> directions, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing. So <b>I</b> stood quite still {{with my back}} to the wall, and called out softly: ...|$|R
60|$|He hesitated. He looked <b>all</b> round. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that he {{was making}} a great effort. The spirit of Paris battled against his better nature. He was tempted, but he didn't fall.|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes, sir; {{but it is}} just {{possible}} that they may have seen the smoke of this hut also, and be making their way here. Though I looked carefully on <b>all</b> sides <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> no other signs of life.” ...|$|R
60|$|JAMES. He's an ugly customer. That's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> There was {{a little}} carpet bag in his hand.|$|E
60|$|And I am {{bound to}} say that, for <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> through {{the mask of}} his face, he was {{satisfied}} with what I gave him, {{though it was not}} much.|$|E
60|$|For <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> he {{appeared}} to be a calm and quiet man, intense beneath the surface, with an air of dignity under insult. My chance to observe Wright was lost.|$|E
6000|$|I called, [...] "Laura!"--at first softly, then {{louder and}} louder. No one {{answered}} {{and no one}} appeared. For <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> and hear, the only human creature in the neighbourhood {{of the lake and}} the plantation was myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not till December. And oh! that gentleman, the conductor, he knew <b>all</b> about it, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> and {{by and by}} I saw him {{lingering}} {{about the}} shop, {{as if he wanted}} to watch me." ...|$|R
60|$|I saw {{the door}} of Miss Verinder's bedroom, {{standing}} ajar. She had put out her light. She controlled herself nobly. The dim white outline of her summer dress was <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> Nobody who had not known it beforehand would have suspected {{that there was a}} living creature in the room. She kept back, in the dark: not a word, not a movement escaped her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yea, yea," [...] {{she said}} (and I {{knew she was}} nodding her head sagaciously); I {{looked out at the}} room window, but <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was a man {{wheeling}} an empty barrow down the brae.|$|E
60|$|The {{magistrate}} complimented {{the woman}} on her muscular powers, and the court-room laughed; but <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was a boy {{on the threshold of}} life, passionately crawling to muddy death, and there was no laughter in it.|$|E
60|$|I {{went into}} my room and drew the curtains, {{but there was little}} to notice. My window opened into the courtyard, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was the warm grey of {{quickening}} sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have written of this day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell it me?" [...] she insisted, {{her fingers}} {{breaking}} suddenly into a livelier melody. [...] "Tell it me at once? You were there <b>all</b> the time. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> you watching. Tell {{me what you}} thought?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I was wakened--indeed, we were <b>all</b> wakened, for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{even the}} {{sentinel}} shake himself together {{from where he}} had fallen against the door-post--by a clear, hearty voice hailing us from {{the margin of the}} wood:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|I didn't hope so. They all crowded up {{and leaned}} over the rails, nearly in my face, and kept still, {{watching}} with <b>all</b> their might. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> them first-rate, but they couldn't see me. Then the captain sung out: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{walked a}} few steps away, and stood with his face hidden from me, {{thinking}} again. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was that {{he took off his}} hat and passed his handkerchief over his forehead. All I could hear was that he talked to himself excitedly in his own language.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so. I'm {{getting down}} and out over the business. Sir James to-day hadn't got any hope at <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that. I don't like him--we don't gee {{together}} somehow--but he's pretty cute, and I guess he wouldn't quit {{if there was any}} chance of success--now, would he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Joe laughed, but a long howl {{close by}} made me dive for a ham; {{for in the}} {{darkness}} of the woods the beasts had got closer, and now <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> were several balls of fire not many yards away. Out went the ham, and a snarling sound showed that the wolves were busy eating it.|$|E
6000|$|There stood Mr. Pike, his sou'wester doffed, his {{oilskins}} streaming rivulets to the floor, while he, dividers {{and parallel}} rulers in hand, {{bent over the}} chart. It was the expression of his face that startled me. The habitual sourness had vanished. <b>All</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was anxiety and apprehension [...] . yes, and age. I {{had never seen him}} look so old; for there, at that moment, I beheld the wastage and weariness of all his sixty-nine years of sea-battling and sea-staring.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{certainly}} the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" [...] cried Jane. [...] "Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them <b>all!</b> If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> but <b>see</b> you as happy! If there were but such another man for you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{suspicion}} that this money {{is to be}} misapplied, or that officials will steal part of it, is likely to prevent a lot of foolish people from investing in the bonds. <b>All</b> this morning <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that men were influenced by this circular, which has been pretty generally distributed." ...|$|R
6000|$|Some pretended, by {{the help}} of these Second-sight Glasses, to see the common Periods of Life; and Others said, they could see a great way beyond the leap in the Dark: I confess, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> of the first was, that holding up the Glass against the Sea, I plainly saw, as it were {{on the edge of}} the Horizon, these Words, ...|$|E
60|$|A {{mile and}} a half it must have been to our journey's end. I could hear nothing but the fearful rattle of the ancient hack over the uneven brick paving; I could smell nothing but the drizzle, now further flavored with coal smoke and {{something}} like a mixture of tar and oleander blossoms. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> through the streaming windows were two rows of dim houses.|$|E
60|$|I went outside, {{not knowing}} whether {{to be angry}} or amused with these queer people. In the broad light of day Holston looked {{as bad as it}} had made me feel by night. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> were the station and freight-sheds, several stores with high, wide signs, glaringly painted, and a long block of saloons. When I had turned a street corner, however, a number of stores came into view with some three-storied brick buildings, and, farther out, many frame houses.|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew--I {{knew she}} would be {{everything}} when once the first strangeness was over; but, poor girl, her heart is in Africa, {{and it has been}} <b>all</b> exile here; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it in every letter, though she tried {{to make the best of}} it. If there had but been a child here!" ...|$|R
60|$|And then, that {{wonderful}} Gabriel voice of his, silent (while his creatures laboured his will), unconcerned, detached and casual, more slenderly tall and aristocratic {{than ever in}} his streaming oilskins, Captain West touched my shoulder and pointed astern over our weather quarter. <b>I</b> looked, and <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was a vague smoke of sea and air and a cloud-bank of sky that tore at the ocean's breast. And {{at the same moment}} the gale from the south-west ceased. There was no gale, no moving zephyrs, nothing but a vast quietude of air.|$|R
5000|$|On this album, Nic Wastell, an Englishman, {{corrected}} {{some of the}} lyrics. [...] "The {{idea came}} from both myself and from our label, because I am fairly lazy {{when it comes to}} writing lyrics. Since we had recorded <b>all</b> the music, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that some of the lyrics weren't entirely complete," [...] says Christensen.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} wishing to tell you, Charlotte,' added Mary, kindly, 'how much we like Mr. Madison. There were some very {{undesirable}} people among the passengers, who might easily have led him astray; but {{the captain and}} mate both spoke to Lord Ormersfield in the highest terms of his behaviour. He never missed attending prayers on the Sundays; and, from <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> I do fully {{believe that he is}} a sincerely good, religions man; and, if he keeps on as he has begun, I think you are very happy in belonging to him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At first <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{of it was}} {{the little}} patch of light at the window. I made for that until it {{disappeared}} suddenly, and I found myself walking into a tall hedge. I felt my way round this until I came to a small gate, and opening it cautiously, walked, not without some little nervousness, up a long path {{which led to the}} door. There was no light and no sound from within. Half repenting of my temerity I shortened my stick and knocked lightly upon the door.|$|E
60|$|All this he boomed {{forth like}} a {{professor}} addressing his class. He had swung round his revolving chair so as to face me, and he sat all puffed out like an enormous bull-frog, his head laid back and his eyes half-covered by supercilious lids. Now he suddenly turned himself sideways, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> of him was tangled hair with a red, protruding ear. He was scratching about among the litter of papers upon his desk. He faced me presently {{with what looked like}} a very tattered sketch-book in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Beyond {{referring}} {{to you in}} one passage as 'this blasted Glossop', she was, I thought, singularly temperate in her language {{for a woman who}} at one time hunted regularly with the Quorn. <b>All</b> the same, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> if you don't mind me saying so, old man, that she felt you might have behaved with a little more tact." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'While I {{stood in}} the middle of the room, hesitating, the priest who had {{admitted}} me passed by and took up his station at the foot of the bed. He motioned me to stand a little nearer, and suddenly the drear silence of the room was broken by the low, monotonous chant of prayers. I bowed my head, and kneeling by the bedside I took up the responses, and once for a moment clasped the white, cold hand which lay upon the coverlet, and which was <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> of the woman whom I was making my wife.|$|R
6000|$|... "--An', say. I 'm mighty glad it {{did last}} {{fourteen}} rounds. <b>I</b> still got <b>all</b> my silk. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that easy. <b>I</b> wasn't breathin' much, an' every round was fast. An' my legs was like iron. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> a-fought forty rounds. You see, I never said nothin', but I've been suspicious {{all the time}} after that beatin' the Chicago Terror gave me." ...|$|R
