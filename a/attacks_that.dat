5|$|An event from April 1 to May 5, 2010 allowed {{players of}} Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver to access a route on the Pokéwalker which solely {{contained}} Pikachu which knew <b>attacks</b> <b>that</b> {{they were not}} normally compatible with, Surf and Fly. Both of these attacks can be used outside battles as travel aids.|$|E
5|$|Dawn aerial {{scouting}} on 21 September returned {{reports of}} the previous day's attacks on roads leading towards the Jordan River, which was only a precursor to the follow up <b>attacks</b> <b>that</b> day. From midday on 22 September, and in particular from 15:00 to 18:00, aerial reconnaissance found Ottoman troops at Es Salt and in the surrounding areas withdrawing towards Amman.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{system is}} similar to its predecessor's, with the {{effectiveness}} of an attack dependent on the timing accuracy of separate actions. The battles still consist of turn-based attacks executed by Mario and Luigi, although these are compounded by the babies' actions during an attack. The Bros. movesmoves performed by Mario and Luigi collectivelyhave been replaced by Bros. Items, which are finite <b>attacks</b> <b>that</b> are gained in the overworld. Similar to the Bros. moves, these are more damaging <b>attacks</b> <b>that</b> can be performed by all 4 characters collectively. Only the adults receive damage, even though the babies will become vulnerable once their respective partners have been eliminated from battle. The elimination of babies will also affect battle as some Bros. Items will become disabled, and the party {{will not be able}} to defend itself with hammers, which are wielded exclusively by the babies.|$|E
50|$|Like most of {{the newer}} {{fighting}} games that have been created, Martial Masters has a combo counter, has Pressure Moves which are performed by pressing the control stick in a certain direction with a button, Roll Recovery that will let you recovery from an <b>attack</b> <b>that</b> knocks your character down before you hit the ground, Flash <b>Attack</b> <b>that</b> will knock your opponent away from when they are attacking you, Shadow Attacks which there are 2 variations of, 1st being a juggle type <b>attack</b> <b>that</b> will knock your opponent up into the air, 2nd is a ground <b>attack</b> <b>that</b> can usually do anywhere between 4 and 13 hits.|$|R

5000|$|From the ISG report itself: [...] "A {{murder of}} an Iraqi is not {{necessarily}} counted as an attack. If we cannot determine {{the source of a}} sectarian <b>attack,</b> <b>that</b> assault does not make it into the database. A roadside bomb or a rocket or mortar <b>attack</b> <b>that</b> doesn't hurt U.S. personnel doesn't count." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{culture of}} America {{succeeding}} the attacks is noted for heightened security {{and an increased}} demand thereof, as well as paranoia and anxiety regarding future terrorist <b>attacks</b> <b>that</b> includes most of the nation. Psychologists have also confirmed {{that there has been}} an increased amount of national anxiety in commercial air travel.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the myth can be found first in Rommel's drive for success as a young officer in World War I, and then in his popular 1937 book Infanterie Greift An (Infantry <b>Attacks)</b> <b>that</b> was written in a style that diverged from the German {{military}} literature of the time. The book became a bestseller, and was supposedly read by Adolf Hitler.|$|E
5|$|A second Overmind {{is created}} in Brood War, formed from {{the merging of}} several cerebrates. This second Overmind never reaches full maturity, and thus lacks the power and {{intelligence}} of the original and is much weaker; <b>attacks</b> <b>that</b> were superficial to the first Overmind send the second into remission, although dark templar energies are still needed to kill it. The second Overmind is captured and drugged by the United Earth Directorate, who use its control of the Swarm to bolster its own forces in the Koprulu Sector, but it is ultimately slain by Zeratul.|$|E

Weapons inspired by the Imperial Regalia of Japan (the Reflector, the Rosaries and the Glaive) can be equipped on Amaterasu as either main or sub-weapons (one each), and used {{in addition to other}} melee <b>attacks</b> <b>that</b> the player can have Amaterasu learn through the course of the game.|$|E
5|$|After the BJP {{victory of}} 2014, Tharoor {{was asked to}} help the {{treasury}} benches draft a statement condemning Pakistan for freeing Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the Lashkar-e-Toiba commander, who masterminded the 2008 Mumbai <b>attacks</b> <b>that</b> killed 166 people. In January 2015, Tharoor asked not to debunk genuine accomplishments of Ancient Indian Science due to exaggerations of the Hindutva brigade, amid 2015 Indian Science Congress ancient aircraft controversy.|$|E
5|$|During {{symptomatic}} attacks, {{administration of}} {{high doses of}} intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the usual therapy, with oral corticosteroids seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile. Although, in general, effective {{in the short term}} for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to {{have a significant impact on}} long-term recovery. The consequences of severe <b>attacks</b> <b>that</b> do not respond to corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis.|$|E

5|$|However, {{following}} the terrorist <b>attacks</b> <b>that</b> {{occurred in the}} United States on 11 September 2001 and American military action in Afghanistan on 7 October, the Government decided to temporarily suspend overseas voting at the 2001 general election as having large numbers of Singaporeans congregating at known locations at known times could put them at risk of further terrorist attacks. Therefore, overseas voting first {{took place at the}} 2006 general election. The number of Singapore citizens who registered to vote overseas was 1,017, and of these, 553 resided in the 16 constituencies that were contested in the election. Eventually, 335 electors voted at eight polling stations around the world.|$|E
5|$|In August 1991, the Yugoslav Air Force's Counterintelligence Service (KOS) {{executed}} {{a series of}} activities, codenamed Operation Labrador, aimed at discrediting the new Croatian government. Operation Labrador was planned to include several terrorist <b>attacks</b> <b>that</b> would go hand-in-hand with the activities of Operation Opera — a propaganda campaign devised to feed disinformation to the media. The two operations were intended to portray Croatia as a pro-fascist state. An alternative name for Operation Opera was Operation Opera-Orijentalis, or Operation Opera Orientalis.|$|E
5|$|Most of Demosthenes' major orations were {{directed}} against the growing power of King Philip II of Macedon. Since 357BC, when Philip seized Amphipolis and Pydna, Athens had been formally {{at war with the}} Macedonians. In 352BC, Demosthenes characterised Philip as the very worst enemy of his city; his speech presaged the fierce <b>attacks</b> <b>that</b> Demosthenes would launch against the Macedonian king over the ensuing years. A year later he criticised those dismissing Philip as a person of no account and warned that he was as dangerous as the king of Persia.|$|E

5|$|Only {{two months}} later she took up the role of close escort in the Pedestal convoy to Malta. During the fierce <b>attacks</b> <b>that</b> dogged the convoy, Ledbury claimed three enemy {{aircraft}} destroyed and five damaged, {{and was one of}} three destroyers that helped the crippled oil tanker Ohio into the Grand Harbour. She added to her battle honours with the Allied landings in Sicily, Salerno, and operations in the Adriatic and Aegean. The Royal Navy finally scrapped Ledbury in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Rufus's {{gameplay}} {{has been}} compared to the fighting styles used by Street Fighter III characters Yun and Yang by the development team, notably in regards to his diving kick attack, and emphasized mobility while attacking. Other attacks were designed as a means to negate enemy offensives, such as the Galactic Tornado, which destroys enemy projectiles while drawing the opponent closer to Rufus for a final strike. His Ultra Combo, Space Opera Symphony, is a barrage of <b>attacks</b> <b>that</b> requires close proximity to the opponent, dealing several blows and ending in a final upwards blast.|$|E
5|$|The {{reinforced}} North Koreans {{had advanced}} on the 25th Infantry Division defensive line and had begun {{a series of}} probing <b>attacks</b> <b>that</b> were to continue throughout the month, sometimes of battalion strength. Most of these attacks came in the high mountains west of Haman, in the Battle Mountain, P'il-bong, and Sobuk-san area. There the 6th Division attacked any UN-held terrain features that afforded observation of its supply and concentration area in the deeply cut valley to the west.|$|E

5|$|Trump {{announced}} in 2001 that the skyscraper {{would become the}} tallest building in the world, but after the September 11 <b>attacks</b> <b>that</b> same year, he scaled back the building's plans, and its design underwent several revisions. When topped out in 2009, it became the fourth-tallest building in the US. It surpassed the city's John Hancock Center as the building with the highest residence (apartment or condo) in the world, and held this title until {{the completion of the}} Burj Khalifa.|$|E
5|$|Abercrombie {{made two}} notable errors of {{judgment}} during the battle. One {{was a failure}} to recognize after {{the first wave of}} <b>attacks</b> <b>that</b> his chosen method of attack was unlikely to work. Instead of ordering additional waves of troops to the slaughter, he should have retreated to a safe distance and considered alternative actions. The second failure was that he apparently never considered ordering a flanking maneuver against the French right. At a minimum this would have stretched the French defenses, allowing his attackers elsewhere to find weak points. In fact, the French twice in the battle sent companies of militia out of their works on the right to enfilade the British attackers.|$|E
5|$|At Monte Cassino the {{historic}} abbey overlooked Allied positions below. Ground commanders were sure the monastery {{was being used}} by the Germans as an observation post. Lieutenant-General Bernard C. Freyberg, commander of the New Zealand Corps preparing for a new assault on the mountain, had repeatedly requested that the abbey be bombed. Taking advantage of the German practice of not giving away their positions by firing on small planes, Devers and Eaker flew low over the monastery, and saw what they believed to be a radio aerial and enemy soldiers moving in and out. Wilson reluctantly agreed to its bombing. On 15 February Devers watched waves of American bombers level the monastery with Alexander, Clark, Freyberg and Eaker. But follow-up <b>attacks</b> <b>that</b> day, and over the next eight days, failed to take the position, much less break the Gustav Line. Devers visited Anzio on 16 February, and agreed with Alexander that Lucas should be relieved. Clark did so on 22 February.|$|E
