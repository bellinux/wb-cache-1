Richard {{came in contact with}} Hare Krishna mantra through the musical Hair, that had then just arrived in London. One of the centerpieces of the musical was the whole cast dancing on stage and singing Hare Krishna. Later, Richard's sister bought the record, which caught his imagination.

A friend of mine said, [...] "Why don't you come along, they're really nice people." [...] I met them, {{and it was one of}} those moments in life when I knew that I belonged here with these people". Richard recalls, that it took him about three days to become a Hare Krishna monk.|$|E
