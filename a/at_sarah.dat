5|$|Druckmann {{wrote the}} story {{in his spare time}} while working at the video game {{developer}} Naughty Dog. He considers A Second Chance <b>at</b> <b>Sarah</b> to be a personal story, focusing on the characters instead of the supernatural elements. Druckmann worked on several unsuccessful comic book ideas and pitches, before collaborating with Wong on A Second Chance <b>at</b> <b>Sarah.</b> Wong's work on the book was extensive, as she refined and extended Druckmann's initial concepts and ideas. The two worked on the book for over a year. The book received generally positive reviews. Critics particularly praised Wong's illustrations, as well as Druckmann's writing and character development.|$|E

5|$|Sarah {{was about}} fifteen when Churchill {{returned}} from the Continent in 1675, and {{he appears to have}} been almost immediately captivated by her charms and considerable good looks. Churchill's amorous, almost abject, missives of devotion were, it seems, received with suspicion – his first lover, Barbara Villiers, was just moving her household to Paris, feeding doubts that he may well have been looking <b>at</b> <b>Sarah</b> as a replacement mistress rather than a fiancée. However, his persistent courtship over the coming months eventually won over the beautiful, if relatively poor, Maid of Honour. Although Winston wished his son to marry the wealthy Catherine Sedley (if only to ease his own burden of debt), Colonel Churchill married Sarah sometime in the winter of 1677–78, possibly in the apartments of the Duchess of York.|$|E

25|$|In 1928, {{convinced}} that Russian literature in exile {{was in fact}} dead, Slonim moved to Paris and, as an anti-fascist, opened up to Soviet patriotism.

He escaped World War II and arrived to the United States aboard the SS Navemar, spending the 1940s and '50s as a teacher <b>at</b> <b>Sarah</b> Lawrence College. He continued to publish tracts and textbooks on Russian literary topics, familiarizing the American public with the major trends of Soviet poetry and fiction.

500|$|Druckmann {{considers}} A Second Chance <b>at</b> <b>Sarah</b> to be a [...] "personal story" [...] that he [...] "wanted to tell". As a child, he {{was always}} interested in creating a comic book, and his ideas developed as he aged. The novel was inspired by Druckmann's interest in traveling {{back in time to}} meet his wife at a younger age. [...] "There's something cute and poetic about that idea," [...] he explained. This idea itself was inspired by time travel stories, particularly the Back to the Future film series (1985–90). Druckmann felt that A Second Chance <b>at</b> <b>Sarah</b> is [...] "a love story driven by grounded characters", not about the demons or time travel featured in the story; he considered the latter a [...] "secret weapon" [...] to attract more readers, and found it necessary to advance the story. Druckmann considered the characters [...] "interesting, yet flawed", and he and Wong worked to [...] "portray the subtlety of emotions". Druckmann felt that he shared many similarities with the novel's protagonist Johnny, and that [...] "a lot of Johnny's flaws and fears are based on [...] own shortcomings". He used the character to deal with his own fears of adulthood and of losing his wife, considering Johnny an [...] "exaggerated version" [...] of himself.|$|E
