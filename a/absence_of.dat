40|$|Labor {{absenteeism}} {{has been}} identified as one of the main factors delaying construction projects. This paper reports an approach to quantitatively estimate the effect of labor absenteeism on the duration of construction activities in housing projects, using discrete event simulation. Absenteeism and productivity data from fourteen housing projects were used to estimate the effect of absenteeism on four construction activities from three different projects. Moreover, four different absenteeism scenarios were analyzed with this methodology: no <b>absences</b> <b>of</b> skilled or unskilled workers; with <b>absences</b> <b>of</b> unskilled workers only; with <b>absences</b> <b>of</b> skilled workers only; and with <b>absences</b> <b>of</b> both skilled and unskilled workers at the same time. As expected, the results exposed that the <b>absences</b> <b>of</b> skilled workers have a greater impact on the runtime of construction activities than the <b>absences</b> <b>of</b> unskilled ones; while the scenario with simultaneous <b>absences</b> <b>of</b> skilled and unskilled workers caused the greatest delays and productivity losses in the activities. The methodology was proved effective to determine the effect of labor absenteeism on the duration and productivity of construction activities. Contractors could apply this approach in order to improve their scheduling procedures, as well as to increase certainty in the attainment of project goals...|$|R
