5|$|Although the prequel/sequel to Superstar Saga, the game's plot is {{completely}} unrelated {{to that of}} its predecessor with more emphasis on the time-traveling theme, which involves the protagonists traveling in between {{the past and present}} of the Mushroom Kingdom. The adventure follows Mario, Baby Mario, Luigi, and Baby Luigi while they search for Princess Peach, who has been abducted by an alien species only known as the Shroobs. The gameplay centers on the co-operation between the quartet, who must use their specific qualities <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> solve puzzles to progress through and features multiple role-playing game elements, but with a turn-based battle system focused on timing accuracy. The game is considerably darker in tone than its predecessor, especially in its plot and themes.|$|E
5|$|In the {{run up to}} the 1911 Varsity Match, the Poulton–Geen {{partnership}} was {{a constant}} threat to opposition teams. Ten days before the Varsity Match, Oxford beat London Scottish 39–3. Twice Poulton put Geen in the clear, with the latter ending the day with four tries in total. On 12 December, Cambridge were favourites to win but Poulton captained Oxford to victory, {{in front of a}} crowd of 10,000. Geen's form coming into the game was suspect but he proved his worth. However, Poulton suffered a hamstring injury early on and his replacement Eric Thomas, a forward, lacked the speed <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> combine effectively with Geen. Nevertheless, he came close to scoring, but, as he had done in the previous year's match, he dropped the ball over the tryline. He was to repeat the error the following year.|$|E
5|$|Further {{indicative}} of the role cognitive flexibility plays in education is the argument that how students are taught greatly impacts the nature and formation of their cognitive structures, which in turn affect students’ ability to store and readily access information. A crucial aim of education is to help students learn as well as appropriately apply and adapt {{what they have learned}} to novel situations. This is reflected in the integration of cognitive flexibility into educational policy regarding academic guidelines and expectations. For example, as outlined in the , a standards-based education reform developed to increase high school graduation rates, educators are expected to present within the classroom “high level cognitive demands by asking students to demonstrate deep conceptual understanding through the application of content knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> new situations.” This guideline within the Common Core Initiative is the essence of cognitive flexibility, and a teaching style focused on promoting it has been seen to foster understanding especially in disciplines where information is complex and nonlinear. A counterexample is evident in cases where such material is presented in an oversimplified manner and learners fail to transfer their knowledge to a new domain.|$|E
50|$|Postulate 4: The individual's life is {{punctuated by}} ego changes. For example, aging, {{a form of}} ego change, causes {{knowledge}} <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> <b>to</b> deteriorate. However, success in an industrialized society demands certain knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill.</b> <b>To</b> satisfy these demands, age-grading ensures that the young possess sufficient knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> <b>to</b> assume authority <b>and</b> the old retire before they lose their skills. This kind of disengagement is effected by the individual, prompted by either ego changes or the organisation—which is bound to organisational imperatives—or both.|$|R

5|$|Partners in Time {{features}} both original {{characters and}} those that were introduced before the game. Professor E. Gadd provides the player with advice throughout the game, while Toadsworth teaches the player new moves <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> progress through the adventure. Although the older Peach is kidnapped, Baby Peach is retrieved from the past into the present by Toadsworth, where she is nurtured by both the old and young renditions of him. Baby Bowser appeared {{near the beginning of}} the game in the past to kidnap Baby Peach, although his plans were halted by an encounter with the Mario brothers and a subsequent attack from the Shroobs. Baby Bowser harasses the quartet frequently during their journey by stealing their Cobalt Star shards, and later attacking the group with his older self. Kamek the Magikoopa, Petey Piranha and Fawful, an antagonist from Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, appear in the game as well.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} that the kinds of language experience and knowledge gained through the statistical learning of the first language influences one's acquisition of a second language.

In that sense, the knowledge of <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> process the first language from statistical acquisition may act as a complicating factor when one tries to learn a new language with different sentence structures, grammatical rules, and speech patterns.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1850s and early 1860s, these colliers {{were joined by}} groups of Irish farmers who had immigrated to America after the devastating potato famine in their homeland. The Irish were {{generally}} unskilled {{in the field of}} mining and so received the lowest-skilled, lowest-paying jobs. Over time, the Irish learned the skills of mining and moved into better-paying, higher-skilled jobs. By the time of the 1880s and 1890s, the low-skill jobs were being taken by the new wave of immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. These groups included peoples from Slovakia, Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, and Italy. Once again, the new immigrants took many years to develop the knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> move into the higher-skilled positions in the colliery.|$|E
25|$|In {{the months}} prior to the July 1940 Democratic National Convention, there was much {{speculation}} as to whether Roosevelt would break with longstanding tradition and run for an unprecedented third term. The two-term tradition, although not yet enshrined in the Constitution, had been established by George Washington when he refused to run for a third term in the 1796 presidential election. Roosevelt refused to give a definitive statement as to his willingness to be a candidate again, and he even indicated to some ambitious Democrats, such as James Farley, that he would not run for a third term and that they could seek the Democratic nomination. However, as Germany swept through Western Europe and menaced the Britain in mid-1940, Roosevelt decided that only he had the necessary experience <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> see the nation safely through the Nazi threat. He was aided by the party's political bosses, who feared that no Democrat except Roosevelt could defeat Wendell Willkie, the popular Republican nominee.|$|E

500|$|When the American Civil War {{broke out}} in 1861, Tubman saw a Union victory as a key step toward the {{abolition}} of slavery. General Benjamin Butler, for instance, aided escaped slaves flooding into Fort Monroe. Butler had declared these fugitives to be [...] "contraband" [...] – property seized by northern forces – and put them to work, initially without pay, in the fort. Tubman hoped to offer her own expertise <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> the Union cause, too, and soon she joined a group of Boston and Philadelphia abolitionists heading to the Hilton Head District in South Carolina. She became a fixture in the camps, particularly in Port Royal, South Carolina, assisting fugitives.|$|E
500|$|Once implemented, the team's game systems did {{not work}} as intended. They built prototypes of the systems and some {{missions}} towards the beginning of development, which uncovered some of their blind spots. For example, their early implementation of the conversation system and user interface afforded them enough time to revise by the final release. They also found the augmentations <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> not be as interesting in implementation as they seemed in the design document. Developers from other companies, such as Doug Church, Rob Fermier, Marc LeBlanc, and Gabe Newell, identified these deficiencies in game [...] "tension" [...] when they played the prototype. This led to a substantial revision of the augmentations and skills; Smith designed an augmentation per-use [...] "energy cost" [...] that led to energy refill rewards and more tactical play.|$|E
