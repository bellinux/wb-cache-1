25|$|A boot is {{a special}} type of shoe which covers the foot and the ankle and extends up the leg, {{sometimes}} {{as far as the}} knee or even the hip. Most boots have a heel that is clearly distinguishable {{from the rest of the}} sole, even if the two are made of one piece. They are typically made of leather or rubber, although they may be made from a variety of different materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality— protecting the foot and leg from water, snow, mud or hazards or providing additional <b>ankle</b> <b>support</b> for strenuous activities— as well as for reasons of style and fashion.|$|E
50|$|Wrestling {{shoes are}} active wear used in {{competition}} and {{practice for the}} sport of wrestling. Generally light and flexible, they try to mimic the bare foot, while providing slightly more traction and <b>ankle</b> <b>support</b> and less chance of contracting a disease or hurting the opponent with exposed toe nails.

40|$|We {{aimed to}} compare the effects of {{different}} <b>ankle</b> <b>supports</b> used after <b>ankle</b> injury/surgery on temporo-spatial gait characteristics. We conducted a randomized cross-over study including adult participants with no previous lower limb or neurological pathology, who underwent gait analysis on an electronic walkway in three different <b>ankle</b> <b>supports,</b> Tubigrip®, a stirrup brace and a walker boot. The 18 participants were {{an average age of}} 42 (SD 13, range 24 - 62) years and 14 (88 %) were female. Compared to Tubigrip®, gait in the walker boot was slower (- 0. 19 m/s, 95 %CI - 0. 23 to - 0. 16, P< 0. 001), step length asymmetry was 10 % (95 %CI 9 - 12, P< 0. 001) worse, single support time asymmetry was 5 % (95 %CI 3 - 7, P< 0. 001) worse and participants also adopted a wider step width (4. 1 cm, 95 %CI 3. 7 - 4. 5, P< 0. 001). There were no important differences in gait between the Tubigrip® and stirrup brace. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} there is a limit to the degree of normal walking characteristics in a walker boot in the absence of lower limb impairment. Further research is required to directly compare the effects of these <b>ankle</b> <b>supports</b> in clinical populations...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objective: In {{spite of}} the {{prevalence}} of ankle sprain, little objective data exist regarding the effect of sensory and motion restriction properties of external <b>ankle</b> <b>supports</b> on <b>ankle</b> sensory motor processes of ankle sprained patients. Subjects and Methods: In the present study, the effects of elastic bandage and rigid brace which had no sensory influence were evaluated for 28 patients. Ankle complex motor performance was measured using the Biodex Balance System. Results: Results showed that rigid brace had no effects on stability indices {{but the use of}} elastic bandage improved motor performance of ankle complex as evidenced by the decrease in overall (P= 0. 004) and AP(P= 0. 010) stability indices. Conclusion: In patients with functional <b>ankle</b> instability external <b>supports</b> used improved <b>ankle</b> sensorymotor functions possibly because of elevated sensory inputs...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{present the}} risks of aeroball, a new sport played by either two or four players on a {{trampoline}} court surrounded by specially constructed fabric walls, and to propose ways to increase awareness and {{reduce the incidence of}} injury, in particular, ankle injury. METHOD: A study was carried out to document the nature of aeroball related incidents, between 1991 and 1995, at Lancaster University Sports Centre. Lace-up <b>ankle</b> <b>supports</b> were introduced in April 1992, and their effect on the incidence of ankle injury was recorded. RESULTS: The lower limb received most injuries (90 %), followed by the upper limb (6 %), then the face (3 %) and cervical spine (1 %). The most common category of injuries was sprains (83 %), followed by fractures (8 %), contusions (5 %), and dislocations (4 %). The most common site of injury was the ankle (73 %). It is during doubles play that injury is most likely to occur. Since the introduction of <b>ankle</b> <b>supports,</b> there has been a gradual decline in the incidence of ankle injury, 31 in 1991 to nine in 1995. CONCLUSION: Aeroball has become a popular sport, but it is not without risks. Leaflets have been produced to promote the objectives, rules, and safety of the game. Trained full-time staff should be present to explain the nature of the game. The use of prophylactic ankle stabilisers in aeroball is strongly recommended...|$|R

To accomplish this manoeuvre in live shows, a hitching mechanism which Jackson co-patented was built into {{the floor of the}} stage and the performers' shoes, thereby allowing performers to lean without needing to keep their centers of mass directly over their feet. The system consists of pegs that rise from the stage at the appropriate moment and special shoes with <b>ankle</b> <b>supports</b> and cutouts in the heels which can slide over the pegs and be temporarily attached to the stage.|$|R

50|$|After {{passing through}} the tarsal tunnel, the flexor digitorum longus tendon must curve around a bony {{landmark}} called the sustenaculum tali. Flexor digitorum longus pain can occur with a trip and fall on uneven surface when the toes {{are not able to}} grip the surface totally. One can also injure the flexor digitorum longus muscle while running on a beach in the sand without any footwear, making the muscle vulnerable at the calcaneus attachment for injuries. In case of flexor digitorum longus pain or strain, the patient will find it tough to walk and will have excruciating pain in the feet and <b>ankles.</b> <b>Support</b> braces along with warm compresses are the most preferred way of treating flexor digitorum longus pain or strain.|$|R
40|$|Ankle {{injuries}} {{are the most}} common injury in physically active individuals. 10 - 12 These injuries often occur in sports requiring frequent cutting and jumping such as basket-ball, volleyball, and football. 9, 12 These activities create an environment that may predispose the ankle to forced inversion and plantar flexion, the common mechanism of injury for most ankle sprains. 11 Increased incidence of ankle sprains and subsequent lin-gering disability has led to the realization that prophylac-tic <b>ankle</b> <b>supports</b> are an important component of injury prevention. Prophylactic measures such as taping and brac-ing are thought to decrease the incidence of ankle sprains. 13, 28 Specifically, incidence of ankle sprains per 1000 exposures decreased from 32. 8 to 14. 7 when prophylactic ankle taping was employed. 13 It has been hypothesized tha...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if the <b>ankle</b> <b>supports</b> chosen were able to provide increased resistance to inversion, as measured by moment of force, without limiting plantar flexion or dorsiflexion. Resistance to inversion moment of force was measured on an isokinetic dynamometer (KinCom) in passive mode, for six support conditions (low-top (LT) and midcut (MC) shoes with semi-rigid and flexible orthoses). The braces used were the Active Ankle T 1 Trainer (AA) and the Ankle Stabilizing Orthosis (ASO). The shoes were ASICS Gel Airier volleyball shoes in low-top and midcut models. It was found that there was a significant difference in resistance to inversion moment of force mean, between the MC alone and the LT with AA. It was concluded that the best support condition was the combination of LT and AA. It decreased sagittal range of motion the least and provided increased force to resist inversion as compared to the control condition (LT). (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Ankle sprain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{injuries}} among athletes and Instability and injury to this joint is responsible for almost long time lost from physical and recreational activity. Also it can impose high cost to sport teams. Prevention of this injury is an important concern of practice and rehabilitation. One way of reducing the possibility of ankle joint injury is using ankle orthosis. The present study aimed at inspecting the effects of two ankle orthoses on dynamic and semi-dynamic postural stability in athletes with chronic ankle instability. Methods: Twenty basketball players with CAI and fifteen non-injured athletes volunteered to participate in this study. Biodex Balance System was used to assess the participants’ postural stability in bilateral position at level 8 and level 2. Repeated measures analyses variance (ANOVA) was performed in order to examine the effects of ankle orthoses. Statistical significance level was determined at P< 0. 05. Results: statistical analyses revealed the significant effect of <b>ankle</b> <b>supports</b> on dynamic and semi-dynamic postural stability in the two groups and results indicated there wasn’t significant difference between groups.
