Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data {{is considered to be}} most accurate of the satellite derived rainfall data and with the best spatial resolution at 250 x 250 grid. For purposes of hydrological modelling in small catchments, this data is usually downscaled to 1 km x 1 km grid to bring it closer to point measurement rain gauge data. This study evaluates whether downscaling of TRMM improves its meteorological drought monitoring capacity. TRMM was downscaled from the original 250 x 250 resolution (Approximately 28 km x 28 km) to 1 km x 1 km resolution based on the relationship between Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and precipitation.

Hence, QAC is usually very effective for consistently popular queries. However, as the web becomes increasingly real-time, more people are turning to search engines to find out about unpredictable emerging and ongoing events and phenomena. QAC approaches reliant on aggregating long-term historic query-logs are not sensitive to very recent real-time events, because newly popular queries will be outweighed by long-term popular queries, especially for less-specific prefix lengths (e. g. 2 or 3 characters).

40|$|Most {{algorithms}} {{trying to}} analyze or forecast road traffic rely on many inputs, but in practice, calculations are usually {{limited by the}} available data and measurement equipment. Generally, some of these inputs are substituted by raw or even inappropriate estimations, which in some cases come into conflict with the fundamentals of traffic flow theory. This paper refers to one common example of these bad practices. Many traffic management centres depend on the data provided by double loop detectors, which supply, among others, vehicle speeds. The common data treatment is to compute the arithmetic mean of these speeds over different <b>aggregation</b> <b>periods</b> (i. e. the time mean speeds). Time mean speed is not consistent with Edie’s generalized definitions of traffic variables, and therefore {{it is not the}} average speed which relates flow to density.

The algorithm introduced in this paper enables easily the estimation of space mean speeds from the data provided by the loops.

Species known to form seasonal spawning aggregations comprised the eight most important commercial reef fish fisheries of the southwest Gulf with respect to landings and ex-vessel revenues, and three of these species increased in annual landings between 1999 and 2007. Peaks in mean monthly landings and revenues for five of eight aggregating species coincided with the timing of their spawning aggregations, whereas commercial fisheries for the remaining three species did not specifically target spawning <b>aggregation</b> <b>periods.</b> Comparisons {{of past and present}} landings showed an expansion of targeted species groups, increased landings for most aggregating species groups, and declines in the landings of several large-bodied species groups.

40|$|Abstract:] The {{control of}} the {{evolution}} of road traffic streams is highly related to productivity, safety, sustainability and, even, comfort. Although, nowadays, the findings from research efforts and the development of new technologies enable accurate traffic forecasts in almost any conditions, these calculations are usually limited by the data and the equipment available. Most traffic management centres depend on the data provided, at best, by double-loop detectors. These loops supply time means over different <b>aggregation</b> <b>periods,</b> which are indiscriminately used as the bases for subsequent estimations. Since space mean speeds are those needed in most applications (note the fundamental relationship between flow and density in traffic flow theory), most current practice begins with an error. This paper introduces a simple algorithm that the allows estimation of space mean speeds from the data provided by the loops without the need for any additional financial outlay, as long as the traffic in each time interval of aggregation is stationary and its speed distribution is log-normal. Specifically, it is focused on the calculation of the variance of the speeds with regard to the time mean, thus making possible to use the relationship between time mean speeds and space mean speeds defined by Rakha (2005). The results obtained with real data show that the algorithm behaves well if the calculation conditions help fulfil the initial hypotheses. The primary difficulties arise with transient traffic and, in this case, other specific methodologies should be used. Data fusion seems promising in this regard. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the improvement provided by the algorithm turns out to be highly beneficial both when used alone in the case of stationarity or {{as a part of a}} fusion...|$|R

To be of practical value to water users, such forecasts should not only be sufficiently skilful, they should also provide information that is relevant to the decisions end users make. The semi-arid Limpopo Basin in southern Africa has experienced severe droughts in the past, resulting in crop failure, economic losses {{and the need for}} humanitarian aid. In this paper we address the seasonal prediction of hydrological drought in the Limpopo River basin by testing three proposed forecasting systems (FS) that can provide operational guidance to reservoir operators and water managers at the seasonal timescale. All three FS include a distributed hydrological model of the basin, which is forced with either (i) a global atmospheric model forecast (ECMWF seasonal forecast system – S 4), (ii) the commonly applied ensemble streamflow prediction approach (ESP) using resampled historical data, or (iii) a conditional ESP approach (ESPcond) that is conditional on the ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) signal. We determine the skill of the three systems in predicting streamflow and commonly used drought indices. We also assess the skill in predicting indicators that are meaningful to local end users in the basin. FS_S 4 shows moderate skill for all lead times (3, 4, and 5 months) and <b>aggregation</b> <b>periods.</b> FS_ESP also performs better than climatology for the shorter lead times, but with lower skill than FS_S 4. FS_ESPcond shows intermediate skill compared to the other two FS, though its skill is shown to be more robust.

Most precipitation episodes in the Sierra are associated with moist southwesterly winds and also tend to occur when the 700 -mb temperature is close to - 2 C. This favored wind direction and temperature signifies the equal importance of moisture transport and orographic lifting for maximum precipitation frequency. Making use of this observation, simple linear models were formulated to quantify the precipitation totals observed at different sites as a function of moisture transport. The skill of the model is least for daily precipitation and increases with time scale of aggregation. In terms of incremental gain, the skill of the model is optimal for an <b>aggregation</b> <b>period</b> of 5 - 7 days, which is also the duration of the most frequent precipitation events in the Sierra.

We now demonstrate a novel mechanism by which the drsA allele exerts its suppressive effect on the disB mutation. Interestingly, drsA does not merely bypass the disB mutation and restore the wild-type pattern of lectin expression.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the seasonal productivity of a prairie grassland (Mattheis Ranch, in Alberta, Canada) {{using a combination}} of remote sensing, eddy covariance, and field sampling collected in 2012 – 2013. A primary objective was to evaluate different ways of parameterizing the light-use efficiency (LUE) model for assessing net ecosystem fluxes at two sites with contrasting productivity. Three variations on the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), differing by formula and footprint, were derived: (1) a narrow-band NDVI (NDVI 680, 800, derived from mobile field spectrometer readings); (2) a broad-band proxy NDVI (derived from an automated optical phenology station consisting of broad-band radiometers); and (3) a satellite NDVI (derived from MODIS AQUA and TERRA sensors). Harvested biomass, net CO 2 flux, and NDVI values were compared to provide a basis for assessing seasonal ecosystem productivity and gap filling of tower flux data. All three NDVIs provided good estimates of dry green biomass and were able to clearly show seasonal changes in vegetation growth and senescence, confirming their utility as metrics of productivity. When relating fluxes and optical measurements, temporal <b>aggregation</b> <b>periods</b> were considered to determine the impact of aggregation on model accuracy. NDVI values from the different methods were also calibrated against fAPARgreen (the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by green vegetation) values to parameterize the APARgreen (absorbed PAR) term of the LUE (light use efficiency) model for comparison with measured fluxes. While efficiency was assumed to be constant in the model, this analysis revealed hysteresis in the seasonal relationships between fluxes and optical measurements, suggesting a slight change in efficiency {{between the first and second}} half of the growing season. Consequently, the best results were obtained by splitting the data into two stages, a greening phase and a senescence phase, and applying separate fits to these two periods. By incorporating the dynamic irradiance regime, the model based on APARgreen rather than NDVI best captured the high variability of the fluxes and provided a more realistic depiction of missing fluxes. The strong correlations between these optical measurements and independently measured fluxes demonstrate the utility of integrating optical with flux measurements for gap filling, and provide a foundation for using remote sensing to extrapolate from the flux tower to larger regions (upscaling) for regional analysis of net carbon uptake by grassland ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that information cascades might occasionally prevent asset markets from performing efficiently. We run experiments in which private signals about an asset with a common value are released sequentially. That allows us to compare the quality of information <b>aggregation</b> in <b>periods</b> in which an information cascade would occur in the absence of prices to the quality of information <b>aggregation</b> in other <b>periods</b> but we find no significant differences. In a second chapter, we focus on information cascades in sequential games, where subjects choose between two options and each subject has a small chance of being perfectly informed about which option is correct. When subjects can only observe the number of times each option has been chosen by their predecessors, the Nash prediction is that subjects follow the minority of predecessors but subjects tend to follow the majority instead. Models that combine heterogeneity in the level of strategic thinking and allow for some degree of trembling (e. g., noisy introspection) fit the data best. A third chapter evaluates the performance of four different auction formats. We find that bidders are not always bidding on the currently most-profitable combination of available items. Instead, subjects sometimes submit jumpbids. As a result, a clock auction in which prices can only increase incrementally generates particularly high revenues. We also find that subjects are reluctant to risk exposure. In the presence of value complementarities, introducing the possibility to submit package bids therefore increases efficiency. In the last chapter, we compare five different stationary concepts: Nash equilibrium, quantal-response equilibrium, action-sampling equilibrium, payoff-sampling equilibrium and impulse-balance equilibrium. Selten and Chmura (2008) run a large number of completely mixed 2 x 2 games in the laboratory for that purpose.

In this work, we introduce an overall optimization approach that improves and complements such frameworks towards identifying the optimal probability for a node to aggregate packets as well as the optimal <b>aggregation</b> <b>period</b> that a node should wait for performing aggregation, so as to minimize the overall energy consumption, while satisfying certain imposed delay constraints. Primal dual decomposition is employed to solve the corresponding optimization problem while simulation results demonstrate the operational efficiency of the proposed approach under different traffic and topology scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Large {{aggregating}} {{groups of}} adult lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris) are annually present {{off the coast}} of Jupiter, Florida, during the winter months. These aggregations are composed of individuals known to exhibit seasonal north - south migrations along U. S. eastern seaboard. Through a combination of passive acoustic telemetry, Pop-off Satellite Archival Tags (PSAT), temperature and current profilers, water temperature appeared to be the environmental cue correlated with the timing, duration and locations of many adult N. brevirostris seasonal behaviours. Adult N. brevirostris of the Jupiter aggregations appear to have a water temperature preference of ~ 23 / 24 °C, which in turn determines the timing of the annual <b>aggregation</b> <b>period</b> and may well be the driving variable for both latitudinal and vertical depth movements. Archived depth and temperature profiles demonstrated that individual sharks adjusted their depth to remain in water with a temperature of ~ 24 °C. Seasonal migrations north in the summer months and south in the winter months follow the annual changes in coastal water temperature, with the location of the winter aggregations in Jupiter located at the most southerly distribution of cooler water temperatures. Thermal preferences seem to dictate aggregating periods, latitudinal migrations, and vertical movements, indicating that temperature is a strong driving factor in both the annual and day to day distribution of mature N. brevirostris attending the seasonal aggregations...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} whether the robustness {{of a market}} mechanism that allocates complementary resources could be improved through the <b>aggregation</b> of time <b>periods</b> in which resources are consumed. In particular, we study a multi-round combinatorial auction that is built on a general equilibrium framework. We adopt the general equilibrium framework and the particular combinatorial auction de-sign from the literature, and we investigate the benefits and the limitation of time-period aggregation when demand-side uncertainties are introduced. By using simulation experi-ments, we show that under stochastic conditions the perfor-mance variation of the process decreases as the time frame length (time frames are obtained by aggregating time peri-ods) increases. This is achieved without causing deteriora-tion in the mean performance. ...|$|R
50|$|Methods {{by which}} {{artificial}} neural networks may alter their structure without simulated mutation and fitness selection have been developed. A dynamically evolving neural network is one approach, as {{the creation of}} new connections and new neurons can be modeled as the system adapts to new data. This enables the network to evolve in modeling accuracy without simulated natural selection. One method by which dynamically evolving networks may be optimized, called evolving layer neuron aggregation, combines neurons with sufficiently similar input weights into one neuron. This can take place during the training of the network, referred to as online <b>aggregation,</b> or between <b>periods</b> of training, referred to as offline aggregation. Experiments have suggested that offline aggregation is more efficient.|$|R
40|$|Droughts are {{widespread}} {{natural hazards}} {{and in many}} regions their frequency seems to be increasing. A finer-resolution version (0. 05 ° × 0. 05 °) of the continental-scale hydrological model PCRaster Global Water Balance (PCR-GLOBWB) was {{set up for the}} Limpopo River basin, one of the most water-stressed basins on the African continent. An irrigation module was included to account for large irrigated areas of the basin. The finer resolution model was used to analyse hydrological droughts in the Limpopo River basin in the period 1979 – 2010 with a view to identifying severe droughts that have occurred in the basin. Evaporation, soil moisture, groundwater storage and runoff estimates from the model were derived at a spatial resolution of 0. 05 ° (approximately 5 km) on a daily timescale for the entire basin. PCR-GLOBWB was forced with daily precipitation and temperature obtained from the ERA-Interim global atmospheric reanalysis product from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Two agricultural drought indicators were computed: the Evapotranspiration Deficit Index (ETDI) and the Root Stress Anomaly Index (RSAI). Hydrological drought was characterised using the Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) and the Groundwater Resource Index (GRI), which make use of the streamflow and groundwater storage resulting from the model. Other more widely used meteorological drought indicators, such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI), were also computed for different <b>aggregation</b> <b>periods.</b> Results show that a carefully set-up, process-based model that makes use of the best available input data can identify hydrological droughts even if the model is largely uncalibrated. The indicators considered are able to represent the most severe droughts in the basin and to some extent identify the spatial variability of droughts. Moreover, results show the importance of computing indicators that can be related to hydrological droughts, and how these add value to the identification of hydrological droughts and floods and the temporal evolution of events that would otherwise not have been apparent when considering only meteorological indicators. In some cases, meteorological indicators alone fail to capture the severity of the hydrological drought. Therefore, a combination of some of these indicators (e. g. SPEI- 3, SRI- 6 and SPI- 12 computed together) is found to be a useful measure for identifying agricultural to long-term hydrological droughts in the Limpopo River basin. Additionally, it was possible to undertake a characterisation of the drought severity in the basin, indicated by its time of occurrence, duration and intensity.
