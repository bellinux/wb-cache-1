40|$|SUMMARY Cytoplasmic vacuolation of {{peripheral}} blood leucocytes is reported in three patients with acute alcoholism. Apparently {{this is the}} first report of vacuolation of {{peripheral blood}} leucocytes associated with acute alcoholism. Apart from any direct cytotoxic effect of alcohol the metabolic acidosis and hypoglycaemia associated with <b>acute</b> <b>alcoholic</b> <b>poisoning</b> may be important factors in the pathogenesis of the morphological changes. The association of alcoholism with reversible vacuo-lation of red cell and, less consistently, white cell marrow precursors is well recognised. 1 When experi-mentally induced by ethanol administration to human volunteers such vacuolation appears to be dose-related, and its development in the presence of folate supplementation and normoblastic haemo-poiesis seems to indicate that it is due to a direct toxic effect of alcohol. 2 We report, apparently for the first time, vacuo-lation in granulocytes and lymphocytes in the per-ipheral blood in three alcoholics, two of whom succumbed to <b>acute</b> <b>alcoholic</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Case reports CASE 1 A 38 -year-old man with a long history of alcoholism was admitted to hospital after being found uncon-scious in his home after a bout of drinking thought to have lasted for six days. On admission he was comatose and his blood pressure unrecordable. The blood alcohol concentration measured some 36 hours later was still 1200 mg/I. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was normal. Clinically he was diagnosed as having acute liver failure with hypoglycaemia and metabolic acidosis. Confirma-tory biochemical results included arterial blood pH 7 - 14; serum bilirubin 66 prmol/l; aspartate amino transferase (AAT) > 100 IU/I; alkaline phosphatase 115 IU/l; plasma glucose < 1 - 2 mmol/l; blood lactate 65 - 3 mg/I and pyruvate 22 - 5 mg/I.

40|$|Abstract — Thiamine {{deficiency}} may {{be assessed}} clinically by an abnormally low specific erythrocyte transketolase activity and/or by an abnormally large activation by thiamine diphosphate in vitro (or 'TPP effect'). In the present investigation, we report erythrocyte transketolase activation by TPP in <b>acute</b> <b>alcoholics</b> and Wernicke-Korsakoff patients undergoing detoxification. A new age-dependent parameter {{was used to}} improve the reliability of transketolase activity {{as an indicator of}} marginal thiamine deficiency. Thus, normalized transketolase activity ratio (NTKZ), primary activation ratio (PAR) and further activation ratio (FAR) were measured in 29 <b>acute</b> <b>alcoholics</b> and 12 Wemicke-Korsakoff patients upon admission, and also on 47 control subjects. It was possible to follow up 14 of the 29 <b>acute</b> <b>alcoholics</b> after 7 days of treatment. Twenty-one per cent of the <b>acute</b> <b>alcoholics</b> and 33 % of the Wemicke-Korsakoff patients, on admission to the detoxification Unit, had NTKZ values beyond the defined critical conditions for thiamine deficiency, whereas 7 % of the former and 25 % of the latter had PAR values beyond these critical conditions. Furthermore, all three parameters were significantly different in the Wernicke-Korsakoff patients compared to the other two groups. The pattern of improvement of the different parameters on follow-up varied considerably and is difficult to explain, as only the NTKZ was statistically significant. Hence, only eight out of 14 <b>acute</b> <b>alcoholics</b> showe...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} the {{questions}} related to the reactions of mitochondrial apparatus of atrial cardiomyocites under the chronic alcoholization were dissolved in this study. The {{purpose of the study}} was to analyze morphological reactions of mi-tochondrial apparatus of atrial contractive cardiomyocites in rats on the chronic <b>alcoholic</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Modeling of the chronic <b>alcoholic</b> <b>poisoning</b> in rats was realized by daily introduction of ethyl alcohol per os in dosage 2 - 3, 5 mg/g of rat weight dur-ing 30 days. Morphological research comprised both light and electronic microscopy of myocardium of right and left atria, right and left auricles, and also interatrial septum. Stereological estimation of several indexes was carried out: the compact-ness of mitochondria, numeral compactness of mitohondria, surface area of external mitochondrial membrane, compactness of mitochondrial cristae, number of mitochondrial cristae, surface area of internal mitochondrial membrane, degree of cristae orientation, coefficient of mitochondrial sphericity, volume of mitochondrium, quantitative correlation of types of mitochon-dria. It was shown that the reaction of different types of mitochondria on development of chronic alcoholization in atrial con-tractive cardiomyocites depends on the structural-metabolic type of mitochondria.

40|$|Acetaldehyde {{may be the}} {{injurious}} {{agent in}} <b>acute</b> <b>alcoholic</b> liver disease.

Activation of C 3 by acetaldehyde exposed liver plasma membranes was increased to 16. 4 % compared with 6 % by non-exposed membranes (p = 0. 004). Human liver plasma membranes bound 212 +/- 18 nmol acetaldehyde per mg membrane protein. The binding constant was 439 +/- 81 microM.

40|$|A normal serum amylase {{level is}} found in up to 32 % of {{patients}} with <b>acute</b> <b>alcoholic</b> pancreatitis. This underlines {{the need for more}} sensitive diagnostic tests in this frequent cause of pancreatitis. Animal and human studies have shown that chronic alcohol consumption leads to important modifications in trypsinogen metabolism. The present work has prospectively analyzed admission serum trypsin activity with a new biochemical test and usual markers such as amylase, lipase, and immunoreactive trypsin in 32 attacks of acute pancreatitis. Seventeen were due to alcohol and 15 to other causes, including 11 with gallstone pancreatitis. High trypsin activity (median: 235 units/liter; range: 165 - 853) was found in all patients with <b>acute</b> <b>alcoholic</b> pancreatitis even when the amylase level was normal on admission (3 / 17 : 18 %). Trypsin activity did not differ between nonalcoholic pancreatitis (N = 15) : 84 units/liter (42 - 98), alcoholic controls (N = 15) : 77 units/liter (40 - 122), and healthy controls (N = 62) : 81 units/liter (15 - 143). The difference was not related to the severity of disease or circulating alpha 2 -macroglobulin, alpha 1 -protease inhibitor, or immunoreactive trypsinogen levels. Lipase/amylase ratio was less discriminant than trypsin activity between alcoholic and nonalcoholic diseases. We conclude that serum trypsin activity seems specific to <b>acute</b> <b>alcoholic</b> pancreatitis and should be included in new prospective studies assessing biochemical testing of alcohol-related pancreatic diseases.

40|$|Alcohol is a {{major cause}} of liver {{cirrhosis}} in the Western world and accounts for the majority of cases of liver cirrhosis seen in district general hospitals in the UK.

The exact pathogenesis of alcoholic liver injury is still not clear but immune mediated and free radical hepatic injury are thought to be important.

40|$|Alcoholic Liver Disease (ALD) {{represents}} {{the second most}} common indication for Liver Transplantation (LT) worldwide. Outcomes of LT for ALD are comparable with those of liver transplantation for other aetiologies of liver disease; however, it&# 039;s still considered a controversial indication to LT, mainly because ALD is considered a self inflicted disease, and for the risk of relapse after LT. Most transplant programs require 6 months of abstinence in order to consider a patient suitable for LT, however the role of the length of pre transplant abstinence as predictor of alcohol relapse after LT is still controversial. A psycho-social assessment to establish the likelihood of long-term abstinence after LT should be performed in patients with ALD potential candidates for LT. <b>Acute</b> <b>alcoholic</b> hepatitis is considered a contraindication to transplantation in most transplant centers.

40|$|CONTEXT: Pancreatitis may {{occasionally}} {{be complicated}} by panniculitis {{as a result}} of the release of pancreatic enzymes. Pancreatic panniculitis is rare, occurring in 2 - 3 % of all patients with pancreatic disorders, with a higher incidence among alcoholic males. CASE REPORT: A 29 -year-old male was admitted to our Department with acute abdominal pain one day following alcohol consumption. On physical examination, tender erythematous plaques and nodules were present on the left ankle and the pretibial regions of both lower legs, a clinical sign of panniculitis indicating acute pancreatitis common in alcoholic patients. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a diffusely edematous pancreas suggestive of acute pancreatitis. Abdominal contrast enhanced computerized tomography revealed features suggestive of severe acute pancreatitis with pancreatic necrosis. A skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of septal panniculitis without vasculitis or fat necrosis, which is indicative of a very early stage of pancreatic panniculitis suggesting <b>acute</b> <b>alcoholic</b> pancreatitis. CONCLUSION: Septal panniculitis without vasculitis or fat necrosis is a cutaneous clinical marker which denotes a very early stage of pancreatic panniculitis associated with <b>acute</b> <b>alcoholic</b> pancreatitis.

40|$|It is {{controversial}} whether acute pancreatitis has longterm effects on pancreatic function. Pancreatic enzyme synthesis, turnover, and secretion were measured in 10 patients in clinical remission {{who had had}} one or more (one to six) attacks of <b>acute</b> <b>alcoholic</b> pancreatitis. The studies were done between two and 29 months after the most recent attack. A control group included five patients with no evidence of pancreatic disease. A four hour primed/continuous intravenous infusion of [14 C]L-leucine tracer was given with secretin (2 U/kg/h) and cholecystokinin (0. 5 U/kg/h) and secreted duodenal juice aspirated. Amylase and trypsin were extracted from duodenal juice by affinity chromatography, permitting measurement of the rate of isotope incorporation into total protein, amylase, and trypsin. The results showed non-parallel changes in enzyme synthesis and turnover with decreases in total enzyme protein and amylase synthesis and turnover but preservation of trypsin synthesis and turnover. The low turnover rates may be ascribed to continuing pancreatic cell malfunction after recovery from <b>acute</b> <b>alcoholic</b> pancreatitis and suggest that the decreased amylase secretion rates are partly a consequence of impaired amylase synthesis and not simply because of loss of pancreatic tissue...|$|R

40|$|<b>Acute</b> <b>alcoholic</b> {{hepatitis}} {{is characterized}} by infiltration of the liver parenchyma with polymorphonuclear leukocytes. As a possible explanation for this phenomenon, {{we have found that}} ethanol stimulates cultured rat hepatocytes to generate potent chemotactic activity. Hepatocytes (greater than 99 % pure), isolated from the livers of Sprague-Dawley rats, responded to incubation with ethanol (2. 0 - 10 mM) by releasing chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes into culture supernatants in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. Chemotactic activity was maximal after incubation of hepatocytes with 10 mM ethanol for 6 h. It was undetectable in the absence of ethanol and was reduced in the presence of either the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, 4 -methylpyrazole, or the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor, cyanamide. Ethanol failed to stimulate generation of chemotactic activity by either rat dermal fibroblasts, hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, or Kupffer cells. The chemotactic activity generated by ethanol-treated rat hepatocytes was recovered from culture supernatants in the lipid phase after extraction with chloroform/methanol. Thin-layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography of chloroform/methanol extracts demonstrated that the chemotactic factor probably is a polar lipid. This chemotactic lipid may account, in part, for the leukocytic infiltration of the liver parenchyma that is observed during the course of <b>acute</b> <b>alcoholic</b> hepatitis...|$|R
