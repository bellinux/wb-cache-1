5|$|There {{were many}} ways to die on the inner German border. Numerous escapees were shot by the border guards, while others were killed by mines and booby-traps. A {{substantial}} number drowned while trying to cross the Baltic and the Elbe river. Not all of those killed on the border were attempting to escape. On 13October 1961, Westfälische Rundschau journalist Kurt Lichtenstein was shot on the border {{near the village of}} Zicherie after he attempted to speak with East German farm workers. His death aroused condemnation across the political spectrum in West Germany. The incident prompted students from Braunschweig to erect <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> the border protesting the killing.|$|E
5|$|Worsley, in London while {{awaiting}} a new berth, joined the expedition {{as a result}} of a dream, in which he was navigating a ship around icebergs drifting down Burlington Street. He took it as a premonition and the next day hurried down to Burlington Street, where he noticed <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> a building advertising what Shackleton called the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. He promptly entered the building whereupon he met Shackleton. After a few minutes of conversation, Shackleton offered him the captaincy of the Endurance, which Worsley accepted.|$|E
5|$|Invited to the Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer at St Paul's Cathedral in July 1981, Livingstone – {{a republican}} {{critical}} of the monarchy – wished the couple well but turned down the offer. He also permitted Irish republican protesters to hold a vigil {{on the steps of}} County Hall throughout the wedding celebrations, both actions that enraged the press. His administration supported the People's March for Jobs, a demonstration of 500 anti-unemployment protesters who marched to London from Northern England, allowing them to sleep in County Hall and catering for them. Costing £19,000, critics argued that Livingstone was illegally using public money for his own political causes. The GLC orchestrated a propaganda campaign against Thatcher's government, in January 1982 erecting <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> the top of County Hall – clearly visible from the Houses of Parliament – stating the number of unemployed in London.|$|E

5|$|Pieces of {{the rope}} which was used to hang Corder sold for a guinea each. Part of Corder's scalp with an ear still {{attached}} was displayed in a shop in Oxford Street. A lock of Maria's hair sold for two guineas. Polstead became a tourist venue with visitors travelling from as far afield as Ireland; Curtis estimated that 200,000 people visited Polstead in 1828 alone. The Red Barn and the Martens' cottage excited particular interest. The barn was stripped for souvenirs, down to the planks being removed from the sides, broken up, and sold as toothpicks. It was slated to be demolished after the trial, but it was left standing and eventually burned down in 1842. Even Maria's gravestone in the churchyard of St Mary's, Polstead was eventually chipped away to nothing by souvenir hunters; only <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> the shed now marks the approximate place where it stood, although her name is given to Marten's Lane in the village. Pottery models and sketches were sold and songs were composed, including one quoted in the Vaughan Williams opera Hugh the Drover and Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus.|$|E

500|$|In {{the initial}} {{years after its}} completion, the tram was unpopular with some living {{underneath}} its route. In April 2007, homeowner Justin Auld, living under the tram route, placed <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> his roof stating [...] "FUCK THE TRAM" [...] in large block letters. The sign is not visible from the street, only from the air. [...] The publicity surrounding the sign prompted city officials to quietly negotiate with the homeowner, and the sign has since been moved and the expletive covered.|$|E

500|$|Although some {{estimates}} state {{that up to}} 100,000 German troops, many of them wounded, may have succeeded in escaping the Allied encirclement, they left behind 40,000-50,000 prisoners and over 10,000 dead. According to military historian Gregor Dallas: [...] "The Poles had closed the Falaise Pocket. The Poles had opened the gate to Paris." [...] Simonds stated that he had [...] "never seen such wholesale havoc in his life" [...] and Canadian engineers erected <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> Point 262N's summit reading simply [...] "A Polish Battlefield".|$|E

According to McClure's, {{there was}} a regular {{turnover}} of tenants and domestic staff, whom Eddy accused of stealing from the house; she blamed Richard Kennedy for using mesmerism to turn people against her. According to Peel, there was gossip about the attractive woman, the men who came and went, and whether she was engaged in witchcraft. She was hurt, he wrote, but made light of it: [...] "Of course I believe in free love; I love everyone." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{surviving}} the bombardment, the POWs were resettled in a camp near Munich. The Germans {{gave them the}} opportunity to return to Nuremberg as wounded soldiers to obtain treatment; the POWs agreed because it was closer to the American lines. On April 17, American troops secured Nuremberg and subsequently freed the POWs. Juskalian described the event: [...] "When the Germans tried to see if we were really wounded, the British erected <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> the gate saying 'Plague', and that kept them out, three or four days later, the 45th U.S. Infantry Division overran Nuremberg and we were liberated." ...|$|E

The main school building is three-stories, and the roof is accessible, albeit with <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> the roof's access door saying [...] "No Entry", but the door is never locked regardless. Adjacent to the main building is another which houses club rooms. The school borders a forest on one side with a chain link fence. Beyond the forest is a park with a fountain and a flight of stairs on a hill. Other than the school, the shopping district in town and the usual path Kōhei takes to school are shown, but otherwise the only other place depicted is Kōhei's two-story house.|$|E
500|$|Danebod has {{continued}} to be a haven for Danish culture through the 20th century and into the 21st. The elementary school, university, library, newspapers, and church services remained Danish language for decades (and remained the most widely spoken language until the 1940s). Danebod remains a predominantly Danish-American town. It is customary to fly the Danish flag, Dannebrog, and Danish cuisine, music, cultural celebrations, language, literature, and the Evangelical Lutheran religious tradition remain important parts of life for the more than 200 inhabitants. Until 1947 church services were held solely in the Danish language, but has since offered one weekly service in Danish. Danebod is sometimes referred to as [...] "the home of the Nissemænd," [...] a reference to the mythological tomte of folklore. There is <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> Tyler Street saying: [...] "Welcome to Tyler. Home of the Nissemaend".|$|E
500|$|Following the Civil War, the Creeks {{were accused}} of aiding the Confederacy {{and as a result}} they ceded the region back to the United States in 1866. In the early 1870s, the federal {{government}} undertook a survey of these unassigned lands. Abner Ernest Norman, a 23-year-old surveyor from Kentucky, was hired to oversee part of this project. Norman's work crew set up camp near what is today the corner of Classen and Lindsey streets; it was there that the men, perhaps jokingly, carved <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> an elm tree that read [...] "Norman's Camp," [...] in honor of their young boss. In 1887, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway began service to the area, which was later opened to settlement as part of the Land Run of 1889; early settlers decided to keep the name [...] "Norman".|$|E

500|$|In 1972, Jerry Claiborne {{took over}} as {{head coach of the}} Terrapins, which had only nine wins in the past five years. In his first season, Maryland {{improved}} to 5–5–1, and the following year, they reached their first bowl game in almost two decades. The team steadily improved until his fifth season, 1976, when they finished the regular season with an 11–0 record, their first perfect mark since Tatum's 1955 squad. Boomer Esiason later described Claiborne's coaching style as [...] "vanilla", and said his strategy was [...] "run right, run left, run up the middle, punt, and play good defense." [...] He went on to say, [...] "But, there's no question he made me a tougher player [...] [...] [...] We'd do drills where the quarterback had to take on a linebacker. It was like he had <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> our back, 'Hit us, we're stupid'. It made you a tougher player." ...|$|E
500|$|The loss of Hornet was {{a severe}} blow for Allied {{forces in the}} South Pacific, leaving Enterprise as the one operational, but damaged, Allied carrier in the entire Pacific theater. As she retreated from the battle, the crew posted <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> the flight deck: [...] "Enterprise vs Japan". Enterprise {{received}} temporary repairs at New Caledonia and, although not fully restored, returned to the southern Solomons area just two weeks later to support Allied forces during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. There she {{played an important role}} in what turned out to be the decisive naval engagement in the overall campaign for Guadalcanal, when her aircraft sank several Japanese warships and troop transports during the naval skirmishes around Henderson Field. The lack of carriers pressed the Americans and Japanese to deploy battleships in night operations around Guadalcanal, one of only two actions in the entire Pacific War in which battleships fought each other, with South Dakota again being damaged while two Japanese battleships were lost.|$|E
500|$|On 20 October 2010, {{following}} a live BBC News at Six report outside Parliament covering the 2010 Spending Review, Robinson silently took the anti-war, anti-cuts placard {{that had been}} waved directly behind him throughout, broke it in two and stamped on it. Afterwards, another protester, who had climbed {{the steps of the}} gantry where the BBC were broadcasting to film the protest on a mobile phone, said: [...] "You should be ashamed of yourself, mate. Shame on you!" [...] Robinson replied [...] "I'm not remotely ashamed of myself. Why should I be ashamed of myself?" [...] He wrote in his blog afterwards: [...] "I lost my temper and I regret that. However, as I explained afterwards to the protesters who disrupted my broadcast, there are many opportunities to debate whether the troops should be out of Afghanistan without the need to stick <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> a long pole and wave it in front of a camera". Some days later, Robinson read out a jokily ambiguous [...] "letter of apology" [...] on the comedy game show Have I Got News for You, broadcast on 4 November 2010.|$|E

500|$|Jason Kaufman, a Harvard {{professor}} who teaches {{the sociology of}} culture, wrote that MOBA {{is part of a}} social trend he calls [...] "annoyism", where mass media venues promote performances and artists who mix the deliberately bad with the clever. The Museum of Bad Art happens to embody this trend, and further illustrates its central aim to mock the judgment system by which people identify what is bad from what is not. For Kaufman, [...] "The beauty of MOBA—though beauty is surely the wrong word—is the way it undermines aesthetic criteria from numerous angles." [...] Amy Levin, describing how American history and culture have been shaped by small local museums, suggests that MOBA is a parody of art itself, and that MOBA's commentary, newsletter, website, and publications mock museums as authorities on what is good art. The director of the Ellipse Arts Center, a gallery in Arlington, Virginia, that hosted a traveling exhibition of MOBA works, was astonished to see people's exuberant laughter because no one visiting the Ellipse had ever responded to art this way. She observed, [...] "If I didn't have <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> the door, people might not think it's so bad. Who's to say what's bad and what's good?" ...|$|E
500|$|<b>A</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> {{eastbound}} I-70 correctly informs motorists that I-70 ends at its four-level stack interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). West of the interchange, {{the freeway}} has {{an average annual}} daily traffic value of 94,221 vehicles. [...] East of the interchange, I-70 formally continued as a four-lane highway for local traffic that averaged 25,300 vehicles per day. [...] The Interstate's speed limit reduces to [...] and then [...] as it passes through its final interchange, a partial cloverleaf junction with MD122 (Security Boulevard), which continues southeast into Baltimore as Cooks Lane. Just east of the interchange, I-70 entered the city of Baltimore and the freeway's median expands into a park and ride facility that was accessed at the Interstate's eastern terminus at a U-turn adjacent to Leakin Park. Eastbound I-70 traffic that wished to access Cooks Lane {{had to make a}} U-turn at the terminus and exit from a westbound loop ramp. Westbound access to I-70 is done via a single entrance ramp off Ingleside Avenue, which is considered part of the MD 122 interchange. The very short section of I-70 in the city of Baltimore is maintained by the Baltimore City Department of Transportation instead of the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA). The 1.95-mile extension beyond I-695 to the I-70 Park and Ride facility was formally dropped from the Interstate system at the AASHTO Spring 2014 meeting.|$|E
