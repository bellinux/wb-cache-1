5|$|Systems {{also exist}} to {{classify}} TBI by its pathological features.

5|$|The {{causes of}} the decline include the {{fragmentation}} and loss of open grasslands to scrub or human activities such as the construction of ski resorts, and a longer-term threat comes from global warming which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted <b>areas,</b> <b>or</b> locally to disappear entirely.|$|E
5|$|Workers form {{foraging}} {{columns in}} search of food. They forage into buildings, eucalyptus trees, ground <b>areas</b> <b>or</b> on low vegetation.

5|$|As {{human populations}} increase, {{and as they}} build houses in low-lying <b>areas</b> <b>or</b> fish or hunt near water, {{incidents}} are inevitable where American alligators intrude, or at least appear to intrude, on human life. Since 1948, 257 documented attacks on humans in Florida (about five incidents per year) have been reported, of which an estimated 23 resulted in death. Only nine fatal attacks occurred in the United States throughout the 1970s–1990s, but American alligators killed 12 people between 2001 and 2007. In May 2006, American alligators killed three Floridians {{in less than a}} week. There have been at least 28 fatal attacks by American alligators in the United States since 1970.|$|E

5|$|By {{the morning}} of July 25 North Korean forces had {{infiltrated}} {{the positions of the}} 1st Cavalry Division so thoroughly that they were disrupting its lines of supply, and Gay ordered the division to withdrawal and re-form its lines further south. Northwest of Yongdong, 1st Battalion executed an orderly withdrawal, covered by the fire of the Heavy Mortar Company and the two batteries of the 77th Field Artillery Battalion. The mortar operators fought as infantry in the withdrawal. During these retreats North Korean troops disguised themselves as refugees and would form roadblocks in the UN troops' rear <b>areas,</b> <b>or</b> used hidden communications equipment to inform higher commands of UN concentrations so those concentrations could be attacked when they were most vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Choughs can be locally {{threatened}} by the accumulation of pesticides and heavy metals in the mountain soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes from global warming, which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted <b>areas,</b> <b>or</b> locally to disappear entirely. Fossils of both chough species {{were found in the}} mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E
30|$|The {{important}} point is that this criterion is used under the assumption that the price is calculated based on the <b>area</b> <b>or</b> weight of the sheets. (In weight mode, it is assumed that the weight is proportional to the area). Otherwise, the conditions will be different. For example, if the price is not calculated based on <b>area</b> <b>or</b> weight, but each type of stock has a unique price (not related to <b>area</b> <b>or</b> weight directly), then a different selection criterion must be defined, which will be described later on.|$|R

5|$|Day 4–8 outlooks are the longest-term {{official}} SPC Forecast Product, {{and often}} change significantly {{from day to}} day. This extended forecast for severe weather was an experimental product until March 22, 2007, when the Storm Prediction Center incorporated it as an official product. Areas are delineated in this forecast that have least a 15% or 30% chance of severe weather in the Day 4–8 period (equivalent to a slight risk and an enhanced risk, respectively); as forecaster confidence is not fully resolute on how severe weather will evolve more than three days out, the Day 4–8 outlook only outlines {{the areas in which}} severe thunderstorms are forecast to occur during the period at the 15% and 30% likelihood, and does not utilize other categorical risk <b>areas</b> <b>or</b> outline where general (non-severe) thunderstorm activity will occur.|$|E
5|$|Green rosellas {{generally}} forage in {{the canopy}} or understory of forested <b>areas,</b> <b>or</b> in hedges, shrubs and trees in more open areas. They {{come to the}} ground to eat fallen fruit or spilt grain in orchards or farmland. They keep quiet while on the ground, and are quite noisy when in trees. Green rosellas forage in pairs or small groups of under 20 individuals, though larger groups of 50 to 70 have been observed at stands of blackberries or thistles in fields. When feeding, they generally hold food items in their left feet and extract edible parts or break and discard nut shells with their beaks.|$|E
5|$|Information {{about the}} {{structure}} and function {{of the human brain}} comes from a variety of experimental methods, including animals and humans. Information about brain trauma and stroke has provided information about the function of parts of the brain and the effects of brain damage. Neuroimaging is used to visualise the brain and record brain activity. Electrophysiology is used to measure, record and monitor the electrical activity of the cortex. Measurements may be of local field potentials of cortical <b>areas,</b> <b>or</b> of the activity of a single neuron. An electroencephalogram can record the electrical activity of the cortex using electrodes placed non-invasively on the scalp.|$|E
