Specifically, we looked at how these technologies were used by school pupils to brainstorm <b>and</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>ideas</b> in a bullying context. 64 school pupils {{were divided into two}} conditions (Skype and AvatarKinect) and were instructed to carry out two tasks (a brainstorming and a negotiation task). Objective task performance, perceived satisfaction and perceived partner’s characteristics were compared. We found no difference in term of perceived satisfaction. AvatarKinect users reported more positive changes in perceptions toward their partner. The results on task performance were ambivalent; Skype users seemed to generate more ideas, whilst AvatarKinect produced better quality ideas. In summary, gesture-based avatar technology appears to be a useful modality to help resolve bullying in schools...|$|E
40|$|This article explores how two {{different}} kinds of subjects, an architect-cum-digital media artist and an engineer, tease out <b>and</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>ideas</b> from alien contexts. Brought together {{by a desire to}} explore the cybridity of physicality through artistic expressions, we recognise the need for a new language and ways of speaking that open potentials for the creation of new realities. Postcolonial discourse and the concept of vertical and horizontal discourses theorised by educational sociologist Basil Bernstein will provide the lenses by which we describe our collaboration, which is partially performed herein through language. We propose to describe our discourse of intervention as discourses in which each dialogue is a deliberative “language game ” played out through the metonymy of ideas in our fields (e. g., belonging and fuzzy membership functions) to produce a subject always different to itself. By interjecting interventions between and among our respective territories of knowledge, we hope to create a new mode of practice that is neither trapped by our territories nor a duplex copy of them, but rather multidimensional transmissions reinterpreting our meaning structures. ...|$|E
40|$|As {{has been}} noted in {{research}} on think tanks {{it is difficult to}} describe what a think tank is, and to pinpoint what it is in think tank activities that generates powerful relationships towards other actors. This is even more the case when talking of transnational think tanks. In this report we give a theoretical account of how relationships organized by transnational think tanks may be analyzed. In the report we are drawing on empirical findings from the World Economic Forum (WEF), seen as a transnational think tank addressing a non-national audience. We are suggesting that think-tank experts are engaged in the brokerage of ideas and knowledge, implying anintermediary activity, wherein ideas are translated, shaped and formatted. Operating at the interfaces of various actors, think-tank experts formulate <b>and</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>ideas</b> with and among actors, encouraging them to adopt and use those ideas. The main argument in the report is that this brokerage can be seen to generate ‘partially organized fields’. The think tank organizes other actors not by constructing a complete organization, but by establishing and maintaining a decided network, drawing upon such organizational elements as membership, monitoring and sanctions. This allows think tanks to maintain a degree of flexibility, whilst gaining control of valuable resources. In the case of the WEF the report show that the combination of a small core of completeorganization with a larger environment of only partial organizing essentially allows the WEF to be bigger than they actually are. The decided networks, i. e. the partnerships, the working groups, and the communities, significantly extends the reach of the WEF, allowing it to reach across organizational boundaries. We suggest that this form of organizing is the prime way for transnational think tanks toorganize outside themselves, thereby exerting political influence. The potential influence it may exert resides in its influence over the shaping of agendas in other organizations, the formulation of pressing political issues, and by mobilizing actors in their decided networks to carry the issues further, on other organizational platforms and with other organizational mandates.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the varied and contradictory ideas about rural {{women and their}} needs that are produced and circulate within development discourses and projects. It pays {{particular attention to the}} multiple actors involved in the production of such ideas and the relations of power that determine which ideas gain authority. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in the Kullu District of Himachal Pradesh, India, it looks at women's participation in three different development projects: a women's savings and credit group, a broad-based development NGO, and the women's village organizations (mahila mandals). These case studies demonstrate how development organizations engage with local gender meanings, often working to reinforce or even exploit inequalities, rather than challenge them. As women are targeted by such projects, they creatively receive, shape, <b>and</b> <b>negotiate</b> the <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> representations that they encounter about themselves. These encounters limit, and sometimes foster, women's potential for new political identities and agency...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} engage in {{reasoned}} discussion is a skill that is needed in many different workplace and community contexts. The capacity to argue effectively can enhance an individual’s democratic participation in contemporary society through, for example, online communication with political representatives, or participation in the political blogosphere. Yet {{studies have shown that}} many citizens’ argumentation skills are ‘only of the most elementary sort’ (Kuhn 1991, 264). This is despite the fact that both the process (argumentation) and the product (argument) of putting forward <b>and</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> perspectives is a fundamental aim of education. Educational argumentation, and the methods and tools of analysis for investigating it, are the focus of this special edition. In combination, the papers present an array of different means by which educational argumentation is currently being researched by key scholars in the field. The methods discussed have been shaped by a number of theoretical orientations and have emerged in a range of disciplinary fields, including linguistics, education, psychology, philosophy and computer science. Many have been influenced by recent developments in technology. Such research necessarily involves judgements concerning the effectiveness and quality of argumentation, as well as ideas on the development of new teaching-learning strategies, processes and resources. In this special edition, however, the focus is on methods for investigating the nature and meaning of argumentation as it occurs in educational contexts and on methods for investigating how it is taught and learned. [...] . In the following sections of this guest editorial, we set the scene for the papers that follow by discussing key trends in contemporary educational argumentation practices, pointing to how such trends are leading to modifications and innovations in research methods. Throughout the sections we also provide critical comment on what we consider to be some of the most significant issues which have emerged as a result of such innovations...|$|R
40|$|In {{this chapter}} we present {{extracts}} drawn from analyses {{of an extended}} technology-mediated scientific inquiry learning activity concerning micro-climates undertaken by 11 - 12 year olds, {{as part of the}} Personal Inquiry project to both exemplify and explore how progressive ‘connection building’ is accomplished multi-modally over time through a multiplicity of semiotic resources. Such progressive connection building is not, as we shall see, a narrow and unidirectional process. Rather, the effective co-construction of mutual, cohesive understandings makes use of multiple representations and interactions and involves revisiting <b>and</b> (re) <b>negotiating</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>and</b> understandings. The metaphor of ‘orchestration’ sits at the heart of our exploration as this metaphor draws attention to the subtle interweaving of activities, ideas and resources {{and the ways in which}} a teacher may make (what are often moment-by-moment) shifts between what is fore-grounded and what is back-grounded in an on-going inquiry. It also captures the sense in which a teacher, or more knowledgeable other, encourages, and works with, learners’ contributions in the context and pursuit of overall goals as part of a longer trajectory of meaning-making. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} how the themes employed in citizenship {{teaching and learning}} are relevant to understanding the education of welfare professionals in English universities. The academic literature on citizenship education has predominantly focused upon the school curriculum and, consequently, the experiences of children and young people. Nevertheless, the boundaries of citizenship education are contested and the research presented here concerns its applicability to vocational programmes in Higher Education outside of teacher training. We argue that although citizenship education has become more explicit within secondary school classrooms, educators involved in the teaching and training of welfare professionals find themselves caught within a number of dynamics that {{make it difficult for}} them to engage directly with the potential value, as well as the pitfalls, of extending a programme of formal citizenship education to their students. Taking a phenomenongraphic approach, we explore how these educators understand citizenship <b>and</b> <b>negotiate</b> the <b>idea</b> of citizenship education within the university context and the wider community within which their students are being trained to practice. In so doing, the limitations and possibilities of extending citizenship teaching and learning to new constituencies are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the way dance {{writers in the}} first two {{decades of the twentieth century}} <b>negotiated</b> <b>ideas</b> of the natural. Discourses around nature, the natural and the modern were extensively debated during this period, which was one of rapid and disturbing social and technological transitions. It was also a period during which there were deep anxieties around notions of the health or degeneracy of the body, this being an issue in which the state had a particular bio political investment. It is proposed that discourses about dancing at this time reveal an antinomy between two different notions of the natural. The first of these is concerned with investigations within the natural sciences: for example Charles Sherrington, Jakob von Uexküll. The second manifested itself as a call to get back to nature that could sometimes betray implicitly reactionary tendencies. The chapter will trace the way unacknowledged concerns about modernity and the consequences of developments in the natural sciences, particularly those dealing with embodied perception and motor functioning, conditioned the developing discourse about natural or free dancing in writings by authors such as Crawford Flitch and Lady Richardson. The wider context includes ideas of the natural as espoused by Macfadden, Sandow and Mensendieck. It then compares this approach to the way later writers involved in the development of dance education <b>and</b> training <b>negotiated</b> <b>ideas</b> of the natural and new scientific ideas to explore new approaches to the practice of dance. This complex discourse can be found in the writings of authors such H’Doubler, Alexander and Todd. It permeates the writings of those concerned with dancing, the self, and the body—and is expressive of a moving forwards at the start of a new century...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} public sphere, which was first {{introduced}} by Habermas, refers {{to the notion of}} a public domain or arena where discourses on various issues take place in society. Central to Habermas’ idea of public sphere is the principle of equal opportunity for everyone to participate in a debate, and the ability of individuals to communicate, <b>negotiate</b> <b>and</b> articulate <b>ideas</b> amongst themselves. Television talk show in this respect could be seen as a mechanism to promote the idea of public sphere. In Malaysia, television talk show is fast becoming a popular television genre and has an important place in television scheduling. In this regard, the latest development in local television scenario necessitates an in-depth investigation into {{the extent to which the}} concept of public sphere vis-a-vis talk show can be regarded as domain where various issues about Malaysia are discussed...|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} the science {{classroom}} practices, I would like to draw to several recent research studies. For instance, Carlone et al. (2014) show that when teachers implement practices that value different forms of doing science (e.g., generating ideas, imagination, drawing on individual students’ experiences and intuition), new identity models can emerge that enhance students’ equitable participation {{and access to the}} learning resources. Along the same line, I suggest that teachers should provide classroom practices that can facilitate the emergence of new narratives about what competent science students and classroom participation mean and what are the authorized languages for engaging in classroom discourses. In addition, teachers also need to carefully attend to and recognize students’ negotiation of contexts and identities. Individual students’ identity work can be subtle and vary depending on students and thus may not be easy to recognize. The field of science education has encouraged teachers to appreciate knowledge and ideas that students bring to the class and build on these (Calabrese Barton and Tan 2009; Hammer et al. 2012). This requires teachers to be responsive to students’ thinking and provide opportunities to explore <b>and</b> <b>negotiate</b> their <b>ideas.</b> I argue that the same effort should be made with respect to students’ identity work. For instance, science teachers’ attention should be focused on how individual students identify each other, how they negotiate identities in order to be recognized as a particular kind of class member, and how the patchwork of multiple students’ identity work impacts individual students’ participation in and learning of science. When these are recognized, teachers should capitalize on individual students’ agentive negotiation and provide more opportunities for re-figuring identities.|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the question why Germany invested in {{what became the}} European Union’s Security and Defense Policy (ESDP), a potential competitor to NATO. In addition to highlighting Germany’s {{role in the development}} of ESDP, it offers a social constructivist explanation for this investment based on the concepts of friendship, estrangement, and emancipation. It develops the argument that (1) states gain ontological security by investing in international institutions to <b>negotiate</b> <b>and</b> pursue <b>ideas</b> of order with friends; (2) deep and enduring dissonance between friends signifies a process of estrangement and poses a threat to ontological security; and (3) if states cannot restore resonance with the old friend-institution configuration, they choose a strategy of emancipation by investing in an alternative. Applied to an analysis of German strategic adjustments between 1990 and 2009 in the context of U. S. -led interventions in Iraq, the Balkans, and Afghanistan, the article suggests that Germany invested in ESDP to offset enduring dissonance with the United States and NATO about appropriate mandate, missions, and means, with France and ESDP emerging as a suitable alternative. With this, the article offers valuable insights into the parameters guiding German security policy and the structure of transatlantic relations and also provides a theoretical alternative to the realist balancing proposition...|$|R
40|$|Artists {{with disabilities}} working in Live Art {{paradigms}} often present performances which replay the social attitudes they {{are subject to}} in daily life as guerilla theatre in public spaces – including online spaces. In doing so, these artists draw spectators’ attention to the way their responses to disabled people contribute to the social construction of disability. They provide different theatrical, architectural or technological devices to encourage spectators to articulate their response to themselves and others. But – the use of exaggeration, comedy and confrontation in these practices notwithstanding – their blurry boundaries mean some spectators experience confusion as to whether they are responding to real life or a representation of it. This results in conflicted responses which reveal as much about the politics of disability as the performances themselves. In this paper, I examine how these conflicted responses play out in online forums. I discuss diverse examples, from blog comments on Liz Crow’s Resistance on the Plinth on YouTube, to Aaron Williamson and Katherine Araneillo’s Disabled Avant-Garde clips on YouTube, to Ju Gosling’s Letter Writing Project on her website, to segments of UK Channel 4 ’s mock reality show Cast Offs on YouTube. I demonstrate how online forums become a place not just for recording memories of an original performance (which posters may not have seen), but for a new performance, which goes well beyond re-membering/remediating the original. I identify trends in the way experience, memory and meaningmaking play out in these performative forums – moving from clarification of the original act’s parameters, to claims of disgust, insult or offense, to counter-claims confirming the comic or political efficacy of the act, often linked disclosure of personal memory or experience of disability. I examine the way these encounters at the interstices of live and/or online performance, memory, technology <b>and</b> public/private history <b>negotiate</b> <b>ideas</b> about disability, <b>and</b> what they tell us about the ethics and efficacy of the specific modes of performance and spectatorship these artists with disabilities are invoking...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates how German-language critics articulated <b>and</b> publicly <b>negotiated</b> <b>ideas</b> {{about music}} <b>and</b> expressionism {{in the first}} five years after World War I. A close reading of largely unexplored primary sources reveals that "musical expressionism" was originally conceived as an intrinsically musical matter rather than as a stylistic analog to expressionism in other art forms, and thus as especially relevant to purely instrumental rather than vocal and stage genres. By focusing on critical reception of an unlikely group of instrumental chamber works, I elucidate how the acts of performing, listening to, and evaluating "expressionist" music were enmeshed in the complexities of a politicized public concert life in the immediate postwar period. The opening chapters establish broad music-aesthetic and sociopolitical contexts for critics' postwar discussions of "musical expressionism. " After the first, introductory chapter, Chapter 2 traces how art and literary critics came to position music as the most expressionist of the arts based on nineteenth-century ideas about the apparently unique ontology of music. Chapter 3 considers how this conception of expressionism led progressive-minded music critics to interpret expressionist music as {{the next step in the}} historical development of absolute music. These critics strategically—and controversially—portrayed Schoenberg's "atonal" polyphony as a legitimate revival of "linear" polyphony in fugues by Bach and late Beethoven. Chapter 4 then situates critical debates about the musical and cultural value of expressionism within broader struggles to construct narratives that would explain Germany's traumatic defeat in the Great War and abrupt restructuring as a fragile democratic republic. Against this backdrop, the later chapters explore critics' responses to public performances of specific "expressionist" chamber works. Chapter 5 traces reactions to a provocative performance of Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony, op. 9 (1906) at the Berlin Volksbühne in February 1920. Chapter 6 examines the interplay of musical-aesthetic and sociopolitical issues in critical reception of several postwar concerts that juxtaposed Schoenberg's "expressionist" Chamber Symphony with Franz Schreker's "impressionist" Chamber Symphony (1916). Chapter 7 considers how critics situated performances of Alexander Zemlinsky's Second String Quartet, op. 15 (1916) in relation to ideas about "expressionism" in music. Finally, Chapter 8 considers critical reception of performances of Béla Bartók's Second String Quartet, op. 17 (1917) in the context of two concert series sponsored by "expressionist" journals: the Anbruch-Abende in Vienna (1918) and the Melos-Abende in Berlin (1922 and 1923). Each of these final chapters uses contemporary criticism as a vehicle for a close reading of the relevant musical work, resulting in a portrait of "expressionist" music that is both contextually and musically nuanced...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{representations of}} space, place and landscape in English and German-language {{poetry of the}} period 1960 - 1975, a key transitional phase between modernity and postmodernity. It proposes that the impact certain transnational spatial revolutions had on contemporary poetry can only be fully grasped with recourse to comparative methodologies which look across national borders. This is demonstrated {{by a series of}} paired case studies which examine the work of J. H. Prynne and Paul Celan, Sarah Kirsch and Derek Mahon, and Ernst Jandl and Edwin Morgan. Prynne and Celan’s 'Sprachskepsis' is the starting point for a post-structuralist analysis of meta-textual space in their work, including how poetry’s complex tectonics addresses multifaceted crises of representation. Mahon and Kirsch’s work is read in the context of spatial division, and it is argued that both use representations of landscape, space and place to express political engagement, <b>and</b> to <b>negotiate</b> fraught <b>ideas</b> of home, community and world. Jandl and Morgan’s representations of space and place, which often depend on experimental lyric subjectivity, are examined: it is argued that poetic subject(s) which speak from multiple perspectives (or none) serve as a means of reconfiguring poetry’s relationship to space at a time when social, literary and political boundaries were being redefined. The thesis thus highlights hitherto underexplored connections between a range of poets working across the two language areas, making clear that space and place is a vital critical category for understanding poetry of this period, including both experimental and non-experimental work. It reveals weaknesses in existing critical taxonomies, arguing for the use of ‘late modernist’ as category with cross-cultural relevance, and promotes methodological exchange between the Anglophone and German traditions of landscape, space and place-oriented poetry scholarship, to the benefit of both...|$|R
