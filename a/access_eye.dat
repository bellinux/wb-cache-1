A major aim of the Program for the Early Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy was to increase compliance with guidelines for screening for diabetic retinopathy. This community-based screening program used non-mydriatic retinal photography and was initiated in four areas of Victoria, Australia from 1996 - 1998. Recruitment strategies included targeted mail-outs, provision of the program brochure in English and the main languages spoken in the areas and media promotion in ethnic newspapers and on ethnic radio stations. In Victoria, only 55 % of the population with diabetes currently <b>access</b> <b>eye</b> care services at the recommended intervals.

The aim of our study was to estimate the prevalence and causes of blindness and visual impairment in the population aged 50 years and above in the Occupied Palestinian Territories using the Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness (RAAB) survey method. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Clusters of 40 people who were 50 years and above were selected with probability proportionate to size using a multistage cluster random sampling method. Participants received a comprehensive ophthalmic examination in their homes, including visual acuity testing by one of three experienced ophthalmologists. The principal cause for visual loss was determined by an experienced ophthalmologist using portable diagnostic instruments. Information about previous cataract surgery, satisfaction with surgery and barriers to cataract surgery were collected. The prevalence of self-reported diabetes was also determined. The prevalence of bilateral blindness (VA or= 3 / 60 and or= 6 / 60 and or= 6 / 18), 23. 2 % had a borderline outcome (VA or= 6 / 60) and 22. 3 % had a poor outcome (VA or= 50 year age group was 26. 4 % (95 % CI: 24. 9 - 27. 9).

40|$|The {{awareness}} of {{a gap in}} eye health care between the rural and urban populations of Australia became obvious in the 1990 s and continues today. Optometrists are the main providers of primary eye health care and therefore {{the question of who}} practises optometry in rural and remote areas is of major importance to address this problem. The aim of this research is to find out what issues face rural and remotely located optometrists in Australia. Some of the questions that were investigated were: how can the maldistribution of optometrists in rural areas be addressed? Is there a profile of the type of optometrist who practises in rural or remote places? How far do patients and optometrists travel to <b>access</b> <b>eye</b> care/offer services? What are the issues concerning the geographical availability of rural and remote eye care services? A literature review was conducted of studies done in the area of rural health care and the supply of optometry services in rural and remote locations. A quantitative questionnaire was developed for the purpose of discovering who successfully practised in these areas, along with retention and support issues. Optometrists who had worked in Australian rural and remote areas {{for at least five years}} and those who offered services to Aboriginal, mining and agricultural communities were targeted. Fifty questionnaires were sent and a response rate of 24 / 50 (48 %) was obtained. Four case studies were also conducted to examine themes, similarities and differences to supplement the data qualitatively. Demographics of the respondents showed that rural raised male optometrists ranked highly in the numbers of those practising in areas with populations of less than 25000 people. The other optometrists who practised in rural areas who didn&# 146;t have rural backgrounds tended to be married to partners who did. Most respondents cited lifestyle reasons for staying, rather than financial incentives. Secondary schooling opportunities for their teenage children were the main issue for considering moving to a larger centre. A third of this rural optometry workforce sample is planning to retire within the next five years. Solutions are discussed that can reduce the existing gap in the demand and supply of the primary eye care practitioners who are fighting visual impairment &# 147;at the coalface&# 148; of rural Australia...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background This {{project is}} a community-level study of equity of <b>access</b> to <b>eye</b> health {{services}} for Indigenous Australians. Methods The project used data on eye health services from multiple sources including Medicare Australia, inpatient and outpatient data and the National Indigenous Eye Health Survey. The analysis focused {{on the extent to}} which <b>access</b> to <b>eye</b> health services varied at an area level according to the proportion of the population that was Indigenous (very low[*]=[*] 0 - 1. 0 %, low[*]=[*] 1. 1 - 3. 0 %, low medium[*]=[*] 3. 1 - 6. 0 %, high medium[*]=[*] 6. 1 - 10. 0 %, high[*]=[*] 10. 1 - 20. 0 %, very high[*]=[*] 20 [*]+[*]%). The analysis of health service utilisation also took into account age, remoteness and the Socioeconomic Indices for Areas (SEIFA). Results The rate of eye exams provided in areas with very high Indigenous populations was two-thirds of the rate of eye exams for areas with very low indigenous populations. The cataract surgery rates in areas with high medium to very high Indigenous populations were less than half that reference areas. In over a third of communities with very high Indigenous populations the cataract surgery rate fell below the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines compared to a cataract surgery rate of 3 % in areas with very low Indigenous populations. Conclusions There remain serious disparities in <b>access</b> to <b>eye</b> health service in areas with high Indigenous populations. Addressing disparities requires a co-ordinated approach to improving Indigenous people’s <b>access</b> to <b>eye</b> health services. More extensive take-up of existing Medicare provisions is an important step in this process. Along with improving access to health services, community education concerning the importance of eye health and the effectiveness of treatment might reduce reluctance to seek help. </p...|$|R

The touch phone has become a central part of the ecology of devices and can no longer be overlooked, and the login process is also an important part of this ecology and a precondition to be able to connect to services within the ecology. The primary objective of this thesis have been to contribute with research about authentication on touch phones, by addressing the challenges to current authentication mechanisms, users mental model of security, eye tracking of authentication mechanisms and accessibility. Throughout the thesis several methods have been applied to get to know users behavior and the their relation to security and authentication mechanisms on touch phones. It was made a review of several authentication mechanisms, using different types of interaction. The review were based on findings from the interviews showing that the users thinks it is important that these mechanisms are easy to remember and efficient to use. In addition to concepts of direct manipulation, context and recommendations’ from W 3 C. I argue that there all mechanisms have disadvantages, and that context is one of the factors that makes it hard to create usable and secure methods. The second research question are discussing users mental model of security, and I argue that the technology have been moving faster then the users are able to adapt in terms of security. The research shows that people are not too concerned about security on touch phones. The need for securing the phone is increasing as the content on the phone increases, but the users are not adapting to this, and jeopardize the security for easy and fast <b>access.</b> <b>Eye</b> tracking were applied to the research to investigate how users interact and look at different authentication mechanisms on touch phones. I argue that there are practical issues and with conducting eye tracking of authentication methods. All authentication IDs are different and comparing them or creating heat maps would therefor not be appropriate. But it is a good method that generates a lot of data {{that can be used to}} use to uncover general usability issues. The final research question is discussing how to approach accessible design of authentication mechanisms, by looking into the concept of universal design and adaptive information systems. I argue that only multimodal user interfaces would be appropriate to add to an authentication process. The research lead to a lot of findings that about peoples understanding of security and use of touch phones, which can be used in future studies about authentication on touch phones.

40|$|MBA thesis (WBS) Optometry {{comprises}} of {{a professional}} service coupled with a retail product administered through third party medical aid payments, all adding to the complexity regarding the patient’s perception to the industry. There is inadequate knowledge of consumers’ needs, {{in addition to a}} culture of individualism amongst the practitioners, causing inefficient competitiveness. More research, with a network of free-flowing information, can facilitate the necessary change to understand how consumers make decisions regarding their optometrist. Important attributes have been identified through a review of available literature and past research. These attributes were categorised by three levels, allowing a research instrument to be developed using Saw Tooth Software. A conjoint analysis was done from the data collected by the survey, resulting in the relevant importance of the decision criteria. Furthermore, T-tests and ANOVA tests were performed on the demographic groups, establishing any significant differences. Of the four attributes, Selection and the Optometrist were found {{to be the most important}} relative to the others, particularly regarding a wide product choice and word-of-mouth referrals. The T-tests and ANOVA tests found few significant differences, indicating all people see optometry as a global need. However, future research is required to identify more specific segments relative to the optometric market thereby enabling a better understanding of their needs. Although the research has resulted in practical information, it has highlighted the desperate need of many South Africans who do not have <b>access</b> to <b>eye</b> care.

40|$|Aim This study‟s aim was {{to conduct}} an audit of visual acuity (VA) against the British Geriatrics Society‟s {{recommendations}} (BGS, 2010), {{in order to establish}} the level of eye services received by older adults living in sheltered accommodation. Objectives included examining whether participants had appropriate <b>access</b> to <b>eye</b> services and attended annual eye examinations for screening of visual impairment (VI). Background VI {{is one of the leading}} causes of morbidity in the elderly population (Chen and Thomas, 2010). An estimated 1. 6 million- 2. 2 million adults aged 65 years and over are visually impaired in the UK (Charles, 2007). In particular the BGS (2010) identifies preventable or treatable VI as a major problem. VI has been associated with infrequency of ophthalmic visits (Abdelhafiz and Austin, 2003), and reduced functional status, predisposing the elderly to falls (Wun et al, 1997; Smeeth and Iliffe, 1998) Method A prospective audit was conducted, including 28 participants 60 years and older. All information was participant-reported and VA results were obtained using a standard six metre Snellen chart. Results were converted to the LogMAR format for statistical analyses. Results 100 % of participants stated they had <b>access</b> to <b>eye</b> care services, however only 61 % of participants had visited an optometrist for an eye examination within the past year as per recommendations. 7 % of participants had VI as defined by a VA of VII 6 / 12 or worse.
