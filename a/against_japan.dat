5|$|In 1945 the United States changed tactics from {{strategic}} {{bombing of}} military sites to indiscriminate bombing of cities, {{including the use}} of incendiary cluster bombs.

5|$|Like most {{strategic}} bombing during World War II, {{the aim of}} the USAAF offensive <b>against</b> <b>Japan</b> was {{to destroy}} the enemy's war industries, kill or disable civilian employees of these industries, and undermine civilian morale. Civilians {{who took part in the}} war effort through such activities as building fortifications and manufacturing munitions and other war materials in factories and workshops were considered combatants in a legal sense and therefore liable to be attacked.|$|E
