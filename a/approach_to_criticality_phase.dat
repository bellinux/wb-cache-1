40|$|We {{look at the}} {{properties}} of clusters of order parameter at critical points in thermal systems and consider their significance to statistical-mechanical ground rules. These properties have been previously obtained through the saddle-point approximation in a coarse-grained partition function. We examine both static and dynamical aspects of a single large cluster and indicate that these properties fall outside the canonical Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) scheme. Specifically: 1) The faster than exponential growth with cluster size of the space-integrated order parameter suggests nonextensivity of the BG entropy but extensivity of a q-entropy expression. 2) The finding that the time evolution of the order parameter is described by the dynamics of an intermittent nonlinear map implies an atypical sensitivity to initial conditions compatible with q-statistics and displays an 'aging' scaling property. 3) Both, the <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>criticality</b> and the infinite-size cluster limit at criticality manifest through a crossover from canonical to q-statistics and we discuss the nonuniform convergence associated to these features.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of the dielectric constant epsilon of pure fluids and binary mixtures near liquid-gas and liquid-liquid critical points is studied within the concept of complete scaling of asymmetric fluid-fluid criticality. While mixing of the electric field into the scaling fields plays a role, pressure mixing is crucial as the asymptotic {{behavior of}} the coexistence-curve diameter in the epsilon-T plane is concerned. Specifically, {{it is found that}} the diameters, characterized by a vertical bar T-T-c vertical bar(1 -alpha) singularity in the previous scaling formulation [J. V. Sengers, D. Bedeaux, P. Mazur, and S. C. Greer, Physica A 104, 573 (1980) ], gain a more dominant vertical bar T-T-c vertical bar(2 beta) term, whose existence is shown to be supported by literature experimental data. The widely known vertical bar T-T-c vertical bar(1 -alpha) singularity of epsilon along the critical isopleth in the one-phase region is found to provide information on the effect of electric fields on the liquid-liquid critical temperature: from experimental data it is inferred that T-c usually decreases as the magnitude of the electric field is enhanced.

40|$|AbstractCritical {{thinking}} {{is at the}} heart of tertiary education, and is also a key focus of university preparation courses. In particular, developing the ability to read − and to read critically – is vital for aspiring university students. Courses in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) generally include some attention to critical reading, but how this is conceived and realised varies considerably. This paper reports on the findings of an ethnographic study of three EAP teaching-learning contexts in Australia and relates the pedagogy of these classrooms to theories of critical thinking identified by Davies and Barnett (2015). All three EAP contexts focused to some extent on cognitive skills such as identifying main ideas, but teachers differed in their <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>criticality</b> and attention <b>to</b> critical pedagogy. In some classes, students appeared to take a performative role (simply ‘doing’ the task); however, in other classes students demonstrated a more intense engagement with the content of their reading – an indication of a developing critical disposition which could serve them well at university and beyond. The paper argues that critical reading pedagogy can be realised in different ways, but that nurturing students’ critical dispositions, in particular, requires delicate scaffolding to support their development as critical meaning-makers. Such scaffolding pushes students to develop deeper skills and criticality, yet enables them to feel secure in the transcultural contact zones in which they are participating...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a multi-scale diagonalization scheme {{to study the}} transition between the many-body localized and the ergodic phase in disordered quantum chains. The scheme assumes a sharp dichotomy between subsystems that behave as localized and resonant spots that obey the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). We establish a set of microscopic principles defining the diagonalization scheme, {{and use them to}} numerically study the transition in very large systems. To a large extent the results are in agreement with an analytically tractable mean-field analysis of the scheme: We find that at the critical point the system is almost surely localized in the thermodynamic limit, hosting a set of thermal inclusions whose sizes are power-law distributed. On the localized side the typical localization length is bounded from above. The bound saturates upon <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>criticality,</b> entailing that a finite ergodic inclusion thermalizes a region of diverging diameter. The dominant thermal inclusions have a fractal structure, implying that averaged correlators decay as stretched exponentials throughout the localized phase. Slightly on the ergodic side thermalization occurs through an avalanche instability of the nearly localized bulk, whereby rare, supercritically large ergodic spots eventually thermalize the entire sample. Their size diverges at the transition, while their density vanishes. The non-local, avalanche-like nature of this instability entails a breakdown of single parameter scaling and puts the delocalization transition outside the realm of standard critical phenomena.
