5|$|It {{appears that}} the most benefit from <b>activated</b> {{charcoal}} is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion. Administering <b>activated</b> charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have delayed gastric emptying due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. <b>Activated</b> charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination. There was reluctance to give <b>activated</b> charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine. Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together. There are conflicting recommendations regarding whether to change the dosing of oral acetylcysteine after the administration of <b>activated</b> charcoal, and even whether the dosing of acetylcysteine needs to be altered at all. Intravenous acetylcystine has no interaction with <b>activated</b> charcoal.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that: (a) {{platelet}} <b>activating</b> factor induces shock and intestinal injury, (b) exogenous platelet <b>activating</b> factor stimulates synthesis of endogenous platelet <b>activating</b> factor, and (c) tumour necrosis factor alpha and endotoxin synergise to induce shock and bowel injury in animals. These last two effects are largely mediated by platelet <b>activating</b> factor forming phospholipase A 2 A 2, a key enzyme for platelet <b>activating</b> factor synthesis, was examined in mouse intestine. It was found that tumour necrosis factor alpha and endotoxin synergise to stimulate platelet <b>activating</b> factor forming phospholipase A 2 activity in the intestine, as well as platelet <b>activating</b> factor production, and these effects were blocked by pretreatment with platelet <b>activating</b> factor antagonists, SRI- 63 - 441 and WEB 2086. In addition, exogenous platelet <b>activating</b> factor stimulates intestinal phospholipase A 2 activity. These results show that tumour necrosis factor alpha and lipopolysaccharide synergistically <b>activate</b> the phospholipase A 2 that participates in platelet <b>activating</b> factor formation, and this activation is largely mediated by endogenous platelet <b>activating</b> factor. Furthermore, platelet <b>activating</b> factor itself increases phospholipase A 2 activity, suggesting that platelet <b>activating</b> factor induces its own synthesis, probably by phospholipase A 2 activation...|$|R

5|$|In 1967, the {{division}} was reorganized.

5|$|In adults, {{the initial}} {{treatment}} for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete {{within two hours}} under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. Gastric lavage, better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. <b>Activated</b> charcoal {{is the most common}} gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol, reducing its gastrointestinal absorption. Administering <b>activated</b> charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than gastric lavage.|$|E
5|$|In general, common ravens {{live in a}} {{wide array}} of environments but prefer heavily {{contoured}} landscapes. When the environment changes in vast degrees, these birds will respond with a stress response. The hormone known as corticosterone is <b>activated</b> by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Corticosterone is <b>activated</b> when the bird is exposed to stress, such as migrating great distances.|$|E
50|$|Mitogens, such as insulin like {{growth factor}} 1 (IGF1), can <b>activate</b> the MAPK/ERK pathway, which can inhibit the TSC1/TSC2 complex, <b>activating</b> mTORC1. In this pathway, the G protein Ras is {{tethered}} to the plasma membrane via a farnesyl group and is in its inactive GDP state. Upon growth factor binding to the adjacent receptor tyrosine kinase, the adaptor protein GRB2 binds with its SH2 domains. This recruits the GEF called Sos, which <b>activates</b> the Ras G protein. Ras <b>activates</b> Raf (MAPKKK), which <b>activates</b> Mek (MAPKK), which <b>activates</b> Erk (MAPK). Erk can go on to <b>activate</b> RSK. Erk will phosphorylate the serine residue 644 on TSC2, while RSK will phosphorylate serine residue 1798 on TSC2. These phosphorylations will cause the heterodimer to fall apart, and prevent it from deactivating Rheb, which keeps mTORC1 active.|$|R
