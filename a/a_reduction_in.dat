5|$|<b>A</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> {{fracture}} toughness {{may also be}} attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities, or for body-centred cubic metals, from <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle. Within the range, the materials behavior is unpredictable. The reduction in {{fracture toughness}} is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance. When above the transition, the fracture is primarily due to micro-void coalescence, which results in the fracture appearing fibrous. When the temperatures falls the fracture will show signs of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. Brittle fracture in steel plates may appear as chevron markings under the microscope. These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture.|$|E
5|$|Biodiesel (in its pure form) is a non-toxic, {{biodegradable}} form {{of diesel}} fuel made from vegetable oil, usually soybean oil or recycled restaurant grease.

5|$|Fingolimod {{may give}} rise to {{hypertension}} and slowed heart rate, macular edema, elevated liver enzymes or <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> lymphocyte levels. Tentative evidence supports the short-term safety of teriflunomide, with common side effects including: headaches, fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and limb pain. There have also been reports of liver failure and PML with its use and it is dangerous for fetal development. Most common side effects of dimethyl fumarate are flushing and gastrointestinal problems. While dimethyl fumarate may lead to <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the {{white blood cell count}} there were no reported cases of opportunistic infections during trials.|$|E
5|$|In cyclic neutropenia, {{there is}} <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> {{the level of}} {{circulating}} neutrophils in the blood that occurs about every 21 days. Opportunistic infections commonly occur and aphthous-like ulceration is worst during this time.|$|E
5|$|Moderate {{to severe}} croup may be {{improved}} temporarily with nebulized epinephrine. While epinephrine typically produces <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> croup severity within 10–30 minutes, the benefits last {{for only about}} 2 hours. If the condition remains improved for 2–4hours after treatment and no other complications arise, the child is typically discharged from the hospital.|$|E

5|$|A June 1965 {{ruling by}} the Kentucky Court of Appeals that {{property}} must be assessed at its full value prompted calls for a special session from Kentucky taxpayers.

The plan passed despite opposition from Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield.|$|E
30|$|Further {{studies have}} also shown that a leafy office {{relieves}} stress and reduces negative mood states by up to 60 % and just one plant {{is enough to make}} a positive difference in the workplace. This research has shown that plants in an office environment can result <b>in</b> 37 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> tension/anxiety, <b>a</b> 58 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> depression/dejection, <b>a</b> 44 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> anger/hostility, <b>a</b> 38 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> fatigue, <b>a</b> 30 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> confusion and <b>a</b> 5 % increase in vigour [3 – 6].|$|R
30|$|Plant height was {{generally}} not affected by the treatment in any genotype but <b>a</b> significant <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> tiller number by about 20 % was observed in N 22, IR 64 and IR 74 (Fig.  1), which corresponded to <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> by about 2 tillers (data not shown).

5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study examined the}} effects on the Antarctic scallop {{of an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It was found that a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It was found that the scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E
5|$|A low calorie diet extends median {{and maximum}} {{lifespan}} in many animals. This effect may involve <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> oxidative stress. While {{there is some}} evidence to support the role of oxidative stress in aging in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems had no effect on aging.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} legal maneuverings {{involving}} both sides {{took place in}} the late winter and early spring of 1996. Defense attorneys requested that cameras be barred from Green's eventual trial, but the request was rejected. Green was judged by court-appointed psychologists to be competent to stand trial and denied <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> bail. The presiding judge ruled that she would stand trial once, for all of the charges against her, rather than be tried separately on each.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that water}} {{contamination}} {{is a major}} means of transmitting diarrheal disease, efforts to provide clean water supply and improved sanitation {{have the potential to}} dramatically cut the rate of disease incidence. In fact, it has been proposed that we might expect <b>an</b> 88% <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> child mortality resulting from diarrheal disease as a result of improved water sanitation and hygiene. Similarly, a meta-analysis of numerous studies on improving water supply and sanitation shows <b>a</b> 22–27% <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> disease incidence, and <b>a</b> 21–30% <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> mortality rate associated with diarrheal disease.|$|R
50|$|A {{study in}} a Brazil Urban Centre {{demonstrated}} <b>a</b> significant <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> prevalence and incidence of geohelminthinfection, including trichuriasis, following {{implementation of a}} citywide sanitation program. <b>A</b> 33% <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the prevalence of trichuriasis and <b>a</b> 26% <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the incidence of trichuriasis {{was found in a}} study performed on 890 children ages 7-14 years old within 24 different sentinel areas chosen to represent the varied environmental conditions throughout the city of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.

5|$|Acute cholangitis {{carries a}} {{significant}} risk of death, {{the leading cause}} being irreversible shock with multiple organ failure (a possible complication of severe infections). Improvements in diagnosis and treatment have led to <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> mortality: before 1980, the mortality rate was greater than 50%, but after 1980 it was 10–30%. Patients with signs of multiple organ failure are likely to die unless they undergo early biliary drainage and treatment with systemic antibiotics. Other causes of death following severe cholangitis include heart failure and pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous-like {{ulceration}} also {{occurs in}} conditions involving systemic immuno-dysregulation, e.g. cyclic neutropenia and {{human immunodeficiency virus}} infection. In cyclic neutropenia, more severe oral ulceration occurs during periods of severe immuno-dysregulation, and resolution of the underlying neutropenia prevents the cycle of ulceration. The relative increase in percentage of CD8+ T cells, caused by <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> numbers of CD4+ T cells may be implicated in RAS-type ulceration in HIV infection.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism {{has also}} led to the {{development}} of mimicry complexes of Batesian mimicry, where edible species mimic aposematic taxa, and Müllerian mimicry, where inedible species, often of related taxa, have evolved to resemble each other, so as to benefit from reduced sampling rates by predators during learning. Similarly, adult Sesiidae species (also known as clearwing moths) have a general appearance that is sufficiently similar to a wasp or hornet to make it likely that the moths gain <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> predation by Batesian mimicry.|$|E
