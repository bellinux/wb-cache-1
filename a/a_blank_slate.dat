25|$|Part of Aristotle's psychology, {{the study}} of the soul, is his account of the ability of humans to reason and the ability of animals to perceive. In both cases, perfect copies of forms are acquired, either by direct {{impression}} of environmental forms, in the case of perception, or else by virtue of contemplation, understanding and recollection. He believed the mind can literally assume any form being contemplated or experienced, and it was unique in its ability to become <b>a</b> <b>blank</b> <b>slate,</b> having no essential form. As thoughts of earth are not heavy, any more than thoughts of fire are causally efficient, they provide an immaterial complement for the formless mind.|$|E

[...] The New York Times reviewer Janet Maslin called Gump a [...] "hollow man" [...] who is [...] "self-congratulatory in his blissful ignorance, warmly embraced as the embodiment of absolutely nothing." [...] Marc Vincenti of Palo Alto Weekly called the character [...] "a pitiful stooge taking the pie of life in the face, thoughtfully licking his fingers." [...] Bruce Kawin and Gerald Mast's textbook on film history notes that Forrest Gump's dimness was a metaphor for glamorized nostalgia in that he represented <b>a</b> <b>blank</b> <b>slate</b> by which the Baby Boomer generation projected their memories of those events.|$|E

500|$|Although *Emilia is {{explicitly}} female, Love purposely {{ensured that the}} protagonist's gender is never stated, as she {{wanted them to be}} <b>a</b> <b>blank</b> <b>slate</b> that the player would project themselves into, rather than a character that the player would control.

Several notable landmarks in this story arc include Malibu, the Griffith Observatory, the James Dean memorial and Bronson Canyon in Griffith Park. In an interview with Comic Book Resources, Brian K.

2500|$|Passions {{debuted in}} 1999 with major fanfare. Creator Reilly had been {{credited}} {{for a large}} surge in the ratings for Days of Our Lives years before, thanks to innovative storylines like that of heroine Dr. Marlena Evans being possessed by Satan that drew new viewers, but also tended to alienate stalwart fans. With Passions, Reilly was able to start with <b>a</b> <b>blank</b> <b>slate</b> and no pre-existing fan base to please.

Psylocke has complete telepathic control over Archangel, who is now mentally <b>a</b> <b>blank</b> <b>slate,</b> and utilizes him as a heavy hitter for the X-Men on various missions. Although she does not fully trust Magneto or agree with his methods, she remains with him for the sake of finding out if there is any trace of Warren left inside of Archangel.

After following him around town, she and Magneto end up caught in a trap created by the Clan Akkaba who seek to create clones of Archangel. Psylocke then battles the clones to protect the citizens of Green Ridge and watches as Warren merges with them to create a brand new Angel.|$|E

50|$|Many textbooks, in {{noting the}} {{emphasis}} Skinner {{places on the}} environment, argue that Skinner held that the organism is <b>a</b> <b>blank</b> <b>slate</b> or a tabula rasa.

50|$|Pinker claims {{these fears}} are non sequiturs, {{and that the}} blank slate view of human nature would {{actually}} be a greater threat if it were true. For example, he argues that political equality does not require sameness, but policies that treat people as individuals with rights; that moral progress doesn't require the human mind to be naturally free of selfish motives, only that it has other motives to counteract them; that responsibility doesn't require behavior to be uncaused, only that it respond to praise and blame; and that meaning in life doesn't require that the process that shaped the brain must have a purpose, only that the brain itself must have purposes. He also argues that grounding moral values in claims about <b>a</b> <b>blank</b> <b>slate</b> opens them {{to the possibility of}} being overturned by future empirical discoveries. He further argues that <b>a</b> <b>blank</b> <b>slate</b> is in fact inconsistent with opposition to many social evils since <b>a</b> <b>blank</b> <b>slate</b> could be conditioned to enjoy servitude and degradation.|$|E
