5|$|Alcoholism is characterised by an {{increased}} tolerance to alcohol–which means {{that an individual}} can consume more alcohol–and physical dependence on alcohol, which {{makes it hard for}} an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking. Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A depressed mood is a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.|$|E
5|$|Atomic sodium has <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> {{spectral}} {{line in the}} yellow-orange part of the spectrum (the same line as is used in sodium vapour street lights). This appears as an absorption line in many types of stars, including the Sun. The line was first studied in 1814 by Joseph von Fraunhofer during his investigation of the lines in the solar spectrum, {{now known as the}} Fraunhofer lines. Fraunhofer named it the 'D line', although it is now known to actually be a group of closely-spaced lines split by fine and hyperfine structure.|$|E
5|$|Banksia prionotes occurs {{throughout}} much of the Southwest Botanical Province, occurring both along the west coast and well inland, and ranging from Shark Bay (25°30′S) in the north, to Kojonup (33°50'S) and Jerramungup (34°24'S 118°55'E) in the south and south-east respectively. It grows among tall shrubland or low woodland, mostly in the swales and lower slopes of dunes, and shows <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> preference for deep white or yellow sand.|$|E

5000|$|On {{his first}} {{appearance}} as a three-year-old, Charm Spirit won the Group Three Prix Djebel over 1400 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse, getting the better of Kiram, Imperiator and Bookrunner in a four-way photo-finish. The colt was then sent to England to contest the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse. In <b>an</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> renewal of the classic he finished fifth behind Night of Thunder, Kingman, Australia and Shifting Power, with Noozhoh Canarias, Toormore, Kingston Hill, War Command, The Grey Gatsby, Bookrunner and Outstrip among the unplaced runners.|$|R
50|$|The {{concrete}} {{used in the}} Glenfinnan Viaduct is mass concrete, which unlike {{reinforced concrete}} does not contain any metal reinforcement. It is formed by pouring concrete, typically using fine aggregate, into formwork, resulting in <b>a</b> material <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> in compression but weak in tension.|$|R
5|$|Glacial {{acetic acid}} {{is used in}} {{analytical}} chemistry for the estimation of weakly alkaline substances such as organic amides. Glacial acetic acid is a much weaker base than water, so the amide behaves as a strong base in this medium. It then can be titrated using a solution in glacial acetic acid of <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> acid, such as perchloric acid.|$|E
5|$|His {{primary focus}} was gay-themed writing, though {{he also wrote}} about the {{entertainment}} industry. Mostly satirical, his writing was filled with increasingly clear anger and disdain for the Republican neo-con agenda, especially after the AIDS pandemic began to take a large toll on the gay community. <b>A</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> voice in gay literature, Baker had admirers and detractors for his gay radical stance, both in the mainstream literary {{community as well as}} the gay community itself.|$|E
5|$|Potassium {{compounds}} {{are often}} used as fertilisers as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition. Potassium hydroxide is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> base, and is used to control the pH of various substances. Potassium nitrate and potassium permanganate {{are often used}} as powerful oxidising agents. Potassium superoxide is used in breathing masks, as it reacts with carbon dioxide to give potassium carbonate and oxygen gas. Pure potassium metal is not often used, but its alloys with sodium may substitute for pure sodium in fast breeder nuclear reactors.|$|E

5|$|The ZX Spectrum enjoyed <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> {{community}} early on. Several dedicated magazines {{were released}} including Sinclair User (1982), Your Spectrum (1983), rebranded as Your Sinclair in 1986, and CRASH (1984). Early on {{they were very}} technically oriented with type-in programs and machine code tutorials. Later on they became almost completely game-oriented. Several general contemporary computer magazines covered the ZX Spectrum in more or less detail. They included Computer Gamer, Computer and Video Games, Computing Today, Popular Computing Weekly, Your Computer and The Games Machine.|$|E
5|$|Although usually trivalent, {{ytterbium}} readily forms divalent compounds. This {{behavior is}} unusual for lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 {{state has a}} valence electron configuration of 4f14 because the fully filled f-shell gives more stability. The yellow-green ytterbium(II) ion is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> reducing agent and decomposes water, releasing hydrogen gas, and thus only the colorless ytterbium(III) ion occurs in aqueous solution. Samarium and thulium also behave this way in the +2 state, but europium(II) is stable in aqueous solution. Ytterbium metal behaves similarly to europium metal and the alkaline earth metals, dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts.|$|E
5|$|Best {{known for}} biting neat round chunks of tissue from marine mammals and large fish, the cookiecutter shark is {{considered}} a facultative ectoparasite, as it also wholly ingests smaller prey. It has a wide gape and <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> bite, by virtue of heavily calcified cranial and labial cartilages. With small fins and weak muscles, this ambush predator spends much of its time hovering in the water column. To maintain neutral buoyancy, its liver, which can comprise some 35% of its weight, is rich in low-density lipids. As this species has higher skeletal density than Euprotomicrus or Squaliolus, its body cavity and liver are proportionately much larger, and the oil content is much higher. Its large caudal fin allows for a quick burst of speed to catch larger, faster prey that come in range.|$|E

5|$|During the {{afternoon}} hours of February10, 2009, a strong, {{middle and upper}} storm system moved across the Four Corners region into the central and southern Great Plains. A moist, low-level air mass streamed northward across Texas and Louisiana into eastern Oklahoma and the Ozarks ahead of the system. Daytime heating of the moistening boundary layer increased throughout {{the afternoon}} across Oklahoma and Texas as cloud cover shifted eastward. Cooling aloft, {{in conjunction with the}} approaching storm system, led to atmospheric instability, resulting in thunderstorms. <b>A</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> wind field increased with height through the lower troposphere, resulting in a wind shear favorable for rotation in the thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and sexual molestation {{did not appear}} to be significant in the development of homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood had a very small effect on adult sexual preference. Homosexual women were more likely to have their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, {{did not appear to}} play a significant role in the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|In {{east central}} Florida, a warm sector, {{a region of}} warm surface air between a cold front and a warm front, was {{positioned}} ahead of a progressing cold front. Large scale lift was supported by <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> jet stream aloft, with strong vertical shear evident, conducive for rotating thunderstorms and tornadoes. Instability increased overnight with temperatures and dew points increasing through the pre-dawn hours. For example, northwest of Orlando, temperatures were still at , which was about 3 degrees warmer than the average high {{for the day and}} 14 degrees warmer than the average low. The conditions helped to form a long-tracked supercell thunderstorm that traveled from Sumter County to the coastal waters of Volusia County during {{the early morning hours of}} February 2, 2007, producing three tornadoes along its track.|$|E

5|$|M87 is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> {{source of}} gamma rays, {{which are the}} most {{energetic}} rays of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays coming from M87 have been observed since the late 1990s, but in 2006, using the High Energy Stereoscopic System Cherenkov telescopes, scientists have measured the variations of the gamma ray flux coming from M87, {{and found that the}} flux changes over a matter of days. This short period makes the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole in M87 the most promising source for these gamma rays. In general, the smaller the diameter of the emission source, the faster the variation in flux, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Silver(II) {{complexes}} {{are more}} common. Like the valence isoelectronic copper(II) complexes, {{they are usually}} square planar and paramagnetic, which is increased by the greater field splitting for 4d electrons than for 3d electrons. Aqueous Ag2+, produced by oxidation of Ag+ by ozone, is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> oxidising agent, even in acidic solutions: it is stabilized in phosphoric acid due to complex formation. Peroxodisulfate oxidation is generally necessary to give the more stable complexes with heterocyclic amines, such as 2+ and 2+: these are stable provided the counterion cannot reduce the silver back to the +1 oxidation state. 2− is also known in its violet barium salt, as are some silver(II) complexes with N- or O-donor ligands such as pyridine carboxylates.|$|E
5|$|Some {{more modern}} steels include tool steels, which are alloyed with {{large amounts of}} {{tungsten}} and cobalt or other elements to maximize solution hardening. This also allows the use of precipitation hardening and improves the alloy's temperature resistance. Tool steel is generally used in axes, drills, and other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other special-purpose alloys include weathering steels such as Cor-ten, which weather by acquiring a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted. Maraging steel is alloyed with nickel and other elements, but unlike most steel contains little carbon (0.01%). This creates <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> but still malleable steel.|$|E
50|$|Manganese bronze, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> hard, <b>strong</b> alloy, is the {{material}} of choice for Lie-Nielsen tools because it is heavier than iron, doesn't rust, and won't crack if dropped. Where the use of bronze would result in excessive weight in a tool, ductile iron is used instead.|$|R
