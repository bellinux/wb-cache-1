40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} historical account of <b>art</b> <b>education</b> in Korea from 1945 to 1990. It does this by tracing the political, social, artistic, and educational developments {{during this period}} and discussing how these affected <b>art</b> <b>education</b> theory and practice. Chapter I provides a brief chronological overview of Korean <b>art</b> <b>education,</b> a statement of the research problem, research methodology, and a rationale for the study. Chapter II deals with Korean <b>art</b> <b>education</b> in the immediate postwar period, from 1945 - 1959; Chapter III with <b>art</b> <b>education</b> during the regime of Jung-Hee Park, from 1960 - 1979; and Chapter IV with <b>art</b> <b>education</b> during the administration of Du-Hwan Jun and Tae-Woo Roh from 1980 - 1990. ^ During all of these periods, <b>art</b> <b>education</b> theory and practice {{have been affected by}} political events, government policies, developments in the art world, and educational trends. Korean <b>art</b> <b>education</b> {{at the end of the}} second World War began with a model of <b>art</b> <b>education</b> inherited from the Japanese and with a marginal, almost nonexistent role in the school curriculum. During the postwar period, efforts were made to purge Japanese elements, to use <b>art</b> <b>education</b> to support government economic and cultural policies, and to import American <b>art</b> <b>education</b> philosophies into Korean <b>art</b> <b>education,</b> and to establish <b>art</b> <b>education</b> more firmly within the school curriculum. ^ All of these efforts have had some impact on <b>art</b> <b>education</b> theory and practice. Nevertheless, <b>art</b> <b>education</b> theory and practice at the end of the 1980 s can be traced back to the Japanese occupation period. Change in Korean <b>art</b> <b>education</b> theory and practice has been gradual and evolutionary even though it has responded to political, social, economic, and cultural changes; to trends in the Korean art world; and to educational developments in other parts of world. It has overcome structural and attitudinal problems to become an established, if not a major, subject within the Korean school curriculum. ...|$|R

Using the money he had saved, Haynes decided to attend the college and enrolled in the Worcester Technical Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, in September 1878.

To earn an income while away from home, he worked as a custodian and night guard at the local public library. He cleaned the building overnight and used his spare time to read books and study. During his final year at the school, boarding rates were increased beyond what Haynes could afford so with no other option, he lived in the library for several months. He could not afford to return home during his stay at the institute, so during the holidays he spent time with his family and friends in New England.|$|E

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this paper, based on a talk given at the National <b>Art</b> <b>Education</b> Association Conference in Dallas, April, 1971, is to review {{literature}} in <b>art</b> <b>education</b> concerning the concept of self {{in order to get}} a better perspective on present thought in <b>art</b> <b>education</b> and to determine new directions, priorities, and purposes. Some of the ways in which <b>art</b> <b>education</b> was influenced by the romantic notion and the sentimental concept of the self, the progressive movement, and by psychology are traced by noting the 4 thoughts of many progressives who viewed the development of self expression and creativity as the central mission of <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> Specific examples of self in <b>art</b> <b>education</b> are given.

Abstract: The {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} issue of creativity in <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> The theoretical {{part of the work}} first explains the general foundation of the social context, which {{plays a key role in}} education focused on the development of creativity. The author outlines the historical roots of the relationship between <b>art</b> <b>education</b> and creativity against the background of emerging interest in creativity in the subject of drawing in the Czechoslovak Republic in the 1920 s. Using key historical milestones in the field of <b>art</b> <b>education,</b> the work looks back at the period of "intense interest in <b>art</b> <b>education</b> and creativity" between the 1960 s and 1980 s in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. On the basis of an evaluation of <b>art</b> <b>education</b> experts, the theoretical part of the work highlights the perceived problems that arose in the implementation of creativity training as part of <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> The selected aspects of the self-evaluation conducted by schools on creativity in <b>art</b> <b>education</b> and reflections on the cross-cultural contexts of creativity chart contemporary issues in the given subject.
