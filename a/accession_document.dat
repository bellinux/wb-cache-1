2500|$|This event {{formed the}} {{cornerstone}} of Patel's popularity in the post-independence era. Even today he is remembered {{as the man who}} united India. He is, in this regard, compared to Otto von Bismarck of Germany, who did the same thing in the 1860s. Under the plan of 3June, more than 562 princely states were given the option of joining either India or Pakistan, or choosing independence. Indian nationalists and large segments of the public feared that if these states did not accede, most of the people and territory would be fragmented. The Congress as well as senior British officials considered Patel the best man for the task of achieving unification of the princely states with the Indian dominion. Gandhi had said to Patel, [...] "he problem of the States is so difficult that you alone can solve it". Patel was considered a statesman of integrity with the practical acumen and resolve to accomplish a monumental task. He asked V.P.Menon, a senior civil servant with whom he had worked on the partition of India, to become his right-hand man as chief secretary of the States Ministry. On 6May 1947, Patel began lobbying the princes, attempting to make them receptive towards dialogue with the future government and forestall potential conflicts. Patel used social meetings and unofficial surroundings to engage most of the monarchs, inviting them to lunch and tea at his home in Delhi. At these meetings, Patel explained that there was no inherent conflict between the Congress and the princely order. Patel invoked the patriotism of India's monarchs, asking them to join in the independence of their nation and act as responsible rulers who cared about the future of their people. He persuaded the princes of 565 states of the impossibility of independence from the Indian republic, especially in the presence of growing opposition from their subjects. He proposed favourable terms for the merger, including the creation of privy purses for the rulers' descendants. While encouraging the rulers to act out of patriotism, Patel did not rule out force. Stressing that the princes would need to accede to India in good faith, he set a deadline of 15August 1947 for them to sign the instrument of <b>accession</b> <b>document.</b> All but three of the states willingly merged into the Indian union; only Jammu and Kashmir, Junagadh, and Hyderabad did not fall into his basket.|$|E
50|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have questioned the}} official date of {{the signing of the}} <b>accession</b> <b>document</b> by the Maharaja. They maintain that it was signed on 27 October rather than 26 October. However, the fact that the Governor General accepted the accession on 27 October, the day the Indian troops were airlifted to Kashmir, is generally accepted. An Indian historian and commentator, Prem Shankar Jha, has argued that the accession was actually signed by the Maharaja on 25 October 1947, just before he left Srinagar for Jammu.|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 118 - 127. Since {{the initiation}} of the Health Transformation Programme in 2003 a series of reforms in health and social security systems have been realized in Turkey. An examination of the official documents related to these reforms {{in light of the}} international right to health documents reveals that the former is coherent with the latter, at least ostensibly. Considering the influence of the EU accession process on Turkey as a candidate country, especially in issues concerning human rights, one may expect to see a push from the EU in the issue of health, as well. However, an examination of the EU‟s demands in the <b>accession</b> <b>documents</b> concerning the health care system, reveals that EU does not have a strong human rights emphasis in health-related issues, especially before 2003. Interestingly, a right to health sensitivity in the <b>accession</b> <b>documents</b> begins to be observed after 2003, namely the iv initiation of the Health Transformation Programme. This shows that right to health is not something the EU ignores, but it hesitates to put concrete demands concerning it, be it because of the principle of subsidiarity, or the second class position the Union attributes to economic and social rights vis-a-vis civil and political rights. Whatever the reason is, the question whether the EU accession process has a role in the right to health sensitivity of recent health reforms in Turkey, can be answered negatively based on the <b>accession</b> <b>documents.</b> Üstünes, Benal NazlıM.

40|$|We {{investigated}} genome dynamics at {{a chromosome}} {{end in the}} model plant Arabidopsis thaliana through a study of natural variation in 35 wild accessions. We focused on the single-copy subtelomeric region of chromosome 1 north (∼ 3. 5 kb), which represents the relatively simple organization of subtelomeric regions in this species. PCR fragment-length variation across the subtelomeric region indicated that the 1. 4 -kb distal region showed elevated structural variation relative to the centromere-proximal region. Examination of nucleotide sequences from this 1. 4 -kb region revealed diverse DNA rearrangements, including an inversion, several deletions, and an insertion of a retrotransposon LTR. The structures at the deletion and inversion breakpoints are characteristic of simple deletion-associated nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) events. There was strong linkage disequilibrium between the distal subtelomeric region and the proximal telomere, which contains degenerate and variant telomeric repeats. Variation in the proximal telomere was characterized by the expansion and deletion of blocks of repeats. Our sample of <b>accessions</b> <b>documented</b> two independent chromosome-healing events associated with terminal deletions of the subtelomeric region {{as well as the}} capture of a scrambled mitochondrial DNA segment in the proximal telomeric array.

40|$|During several {{collecting}} expeditions {{conducted in}} the Eastern part of Macedonia, district Probistip, 27 wild meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.) accessions were collected on different natural stands, like meadows and pastures. <b>Accessions</b> were <b>documented,</b> characterized, evaluated and seeds stored at - 18 °C. One of the traits evaluated was seed crude protein content, which is a desired trait for forage mixture components. The crude protein contents varied from 8. 63 % / 100 g DM for accession MKD 01514 to 14. 6 % / 100 g DM for accession MKD 01496. Accessions grown on dry stands exhibited SCP content less than 10, 0 % / 100 g DM, therefore accessions MKD 01498, MKD 01508 and MKD 01514 may be recommended for further use on a stands with a good-water supply.

In Turkey, there are serious developmental differences in terms of population, income level, economical and social activities between the regions. To eliminate these differences, the regional planning policies and development plans are made. The main goals are to eliminate the regional inequalities, to solve the economic, social and cultural problems of the regions, to satisfy the efficient use of the resources and to control the population movements. In the European Union, even though all member states apply their own national regional policies, {{there is a common}} regional policy to provide the economical and social development and to remove the regional instabilities. To realize these policies, the European Union benefits from certain instruments like financial aids and structural funds.

40|$|After the {{political}} upheaval in 1989, all {{central and eastern}} European countries have suffered a deep "transformation recession". The real gross domestic product shrank between 1990 and 1992 by approximately one fifth in the CEE states. The reasons for that production drop were the changes within the economic system, the consequences of economic disintegration following {{the dissolution of the}} CMEA, the adjustments necessary within the production structure, and partially also country-specific problems. The 5 CEE countries have mastered a great number of the institutional and organizational tasks, but also parts of the structural tasks, in transition from a planned to a market economy. Reforming the system has created the pre-conditions for economic growth. The upswing in 1993 was made difficult because of the setback in western Europe's economic activity. In 1994, all reform states were on a growth course {{that they were able to}} hold in the following years. The negative effects of the Asian and Russian crises on the CEE countries appear to be limited. Against the backdrop of an average economic situation in western Europe, eastern Europe is expected to see its economy grow by around 4 ½ percent in the years to come. In 2000, economic performance in the CEE countries will be up some 10 percent from 1989 based on current growth estimates; broken down by individual states this means: an increase (versus 1989) of slightly more than 30 percent for Poland, of around 10 percent for Slovenia and the Czech Republic, and of around 5 percent for Slovakia and Hungary. Approximate long-term projections concerning the economic growth of a country are possible on the basis of its initial economic development, investment ratio and educational level. In light of this, the EBRD has estimated the growth margin for eastern European countries over the next 25 years. For the 5 CEE countries the estimates show growth rates of between 4 ½ and 6 ½ percent p. a. Such an optimistic outlook for these transitional societies is based on the fact that they have better options to use existing resources than had post-war western Europe or Japan. Caution, however, is advisable in view of the great significance of institutional factors for long-term economic growth, an area where the CEECs still have major deficits. After {{the political}} upheaval in 1989, all the countries in eastern Europe tried to re-orient their economic relations from east to west. The opening up of the markets towards the west and the ensuing keener competition were important ingredients for the changeover from planned to market economies. The countries in eastern Europe were also forced to turn rapidly westward because of the dissolution of the eastern European integration community, i. e., the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), and the decay of their most important markets in the Soviet Union and East Germany. Initially, the EU was very reticent about the attempts of eastern European states to become members. It was only at the European Council meeting in Copenhagen in 1993 that the door for eastern Europe's accession was unlocked. The European Commission recommended in its published opinion (avis) to take up negotiations with five countries (Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia). The other five candidate countries (Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania) were to receive intensive assistance in their preparations for <b>accession.</b> In a <b>document</b> issued in June 1997 (Agenda 2000), the Commission also submitted proposals on how to reform the EU (especially regarding its agricultural and structural policies) and finance eastern enlargement. Accession negotiations started in March 1998 and under favorable conditions could be completed by 2003, whereupon accession requires ratification by parliament of all member countries and the European Parliament.
