5|$|Work {{to improve}} the radar continued. An {{improved}} array was designed which covered 60 degrees rather than 30. The first Dnepr radar was built at Balkhash as a new radar, cell 5. It entered service on 12 May 1974. The second was a new early warning station at Sevastopol. New Dneprs were also built at Mishelevka and another at Skrunda, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>one</b> at Mukachevo. The remaining radars were all converted to Dnepr {{with the exception of}} cells 3 and 4 at Balkhash and Mishelevka which remained space surveillance radars.|$|E

5|$|Another {{proposed}} mission {{would have}} seen a Gemini spacecraft rendezvous with a Pegasus satellite in low Earth orbit. The spacecraft would have either been launched directly into an orbit to rendezvous with the Pegasus, or into a lower orbit, subsequently docking with an Agena, and using that to raise its orbit. The Gemini would have flown around the Pegasus, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>one</b> of the crew would have performed an EVA to recover a piece {{of one of the}} spacecraft's micrometeoroid detection panels. This mission would have been used to prove that rendezvous could be accomplished with any spacecraft, to collect data on the satellite's exposure to micrometeoroids — supporting data that the satellite had returned itself, and to demonstrate technology for military flights to inspect hostile satellites.|$|E
5|$|The second {{classification}} was points classification. On {{each stage}} of the race, points were awarded to the top 10 riders. The winner won 15 points, with 12 for the second-placed rider, 9 for the third-placed rider, 7 for the sixth-placed rider <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>one</b> point fewer for each place down to tenth place. Points were also awarded to the top three riders at intermediate sprints, with five points for {{the winner of the}} sprint and three, and one points for the riders in second and third places respectively. The rider with the most points was the leader of the classification and was awarded a green jersey. There was also a mountains classification. Over the three stages, there were 13 categorised climbs. On each of these climbs, the first four riders to the summit were awarded points, with 5 for the first rider, 3 for the second, 2 for the third and 1 for the fourth. The rider with the most accumulated points was the leader of the classification and was awarded a dark pink jersey.|$|E
5|$|The second {{classification}} was {{the points}} classification. On {{each stage of}} the race, points were awarded to the top 10 riders. The winner won 12 points, with 10 for the second-placed rider, 8 for the third-placed rider <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>one</b> point fewer for each place down to tenth place. Points were also awarded to the top four riders at intermediate sprints, with five points for {{the winner of the}} sprint and three, two and one points for the riders in second, third and fourth places respectively. It was originally intended that points would not be awarded on stage 1 as it was a team time trial. After this was changed to an individual time trial, however, points were awarded on the stage, on the same scale as for an intermediate sprint. The winner of the points classification was awarded a red jersey.|$|E

Other variations featured teams called Gentlemen of the North, Gentlemen of the South, Players of the North and Players of the South who played against each other on several occasions.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} suggests that ethnocentric thinking may have actually contributed {{to the development of}} cooperation.

They found that the ethnocentric individuals clustered together, then grew until all the non-ethnocentric individuals were wiped out.|$|E

O'Sullivan made one at the Northern Ireland Trophy and another at the UK Championship in 2007. Since top 16 players were seeded through to the second round at the 2003 British Open, Higgins' maximums also came in consecutive ranking matches, albeit {{not in the same}} tournament.|$|E
25|$|Randy Orton began a {{feud with}} the new number one {{contender}} for his WWE Championship, the WWE Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy who earned himself a title shot by defeating Triple H in a number one contender's match at Armageddon. Orton gave Jeff's brother Matt, a running punt to the gut <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>one</b> to the head. Two weeks later, Jeff hit Orton a Swanton Bomb {{from the top of}} a 30-foot high scaffolding which knocked out both Orton and Hardy and they were taken off on stretchers. At Royal Rumble 2008, Orton retained his title against Hardy after pinning Hardy following an RKO.|$|E
25|$|A month later, Crawford {{improved}} on {{his best}} score: in the match against Worcestershire at Aylestone Road cricket ground, Leicester, {{he and the}} bowler William Odell came together with Leicestershire at 61 for eight wickets and proceeded to put on 160 for the ninth wicket. The partnership remains, 111 years on, Leicestershire's best in first-class cricket for the ninth wicket and is 75 years older {{than any of the}} county's other first-class partnership records. Crawford was left unbeaten on 99 when first Odell was run out <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>one</b> run later, the No 11 batsman, Arthur Emmett, was also run out, without scoring. Crawford never achieved a century in first-class cricket; the 99 not out remained his best score.|$|E
