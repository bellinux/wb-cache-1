5|$|As {{many more}} {{individuals}} of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, {{there is a}} frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, {{will have a better}} chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.|$|E
5|$|The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works has {{protected}} the copyrights on literary, scientific, and artistic works since 1886. Article 9 of the Convention states that: Authors of {{literary and artistic works}} protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorising {{the reproduction of}} these works, in <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> or form.... Any sound or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction {{for the purposes of this}} Convention. This means a composer has performing rights and control over how derivative works should be used, and the rights are retained at least 50 years after death, or even longer. Even if a song is a traditional arrangement in the public domain, performing rights can still be violated. Where they exist, performers rights may have a shorter duration than full copyright; for example, the Rome Convention sets a minimum term of twenty years after the performance. This created a market for bootleg CDs in the late 1980s, containing 1960s recordings.|$|E
5|$|The {{war effort}} {{was the source}} of {{continued}} disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> of compromise alienated factions {{on both sides of the}} aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.|$|E

5|$|The Internal Security Act allows {{persons to}} be {{detained}} without trial for acting in <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> prejudicial {{to the security}} of Malaysia or to the maintenance of its essential services or economic life. It is authorized by Article 149 of the Malaysian Constitution, which stipulates that if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether inside or outside the Federation in respect of certain situations – including organized violence against persons or property, the excitement of disaffection against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the government, or the promotion of feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population likely to cause violence – then any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with certain articles of the Constitution guaranteeing fundamental liberties. Upon Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, the island republic retained both the Internal Security Act and Article 149 of the Constitution in its statute book.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Hirschfeld's {{work with}} the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, Gerber {{resolved}} to found a similar organization in the United States. He called his group the Society for Human Rights (the English translation of Bund für Menschenrecht) and took {{on the role of}} secretary. Gerber filed an application for a charter as a non-profit organization with the state of Illinois on December 10, 1924. The application outlined the goals and purposes of the Society: o promote and protect the interests of people who by reasons of mental and physical abnormalities are abused and hindered in the legal pursuit of happiness which is guaranteed them by the Declaration of Independence and to combat the public prejudices against them by dissemination of factors according to modern science among intellectuals of mature age. The Society stands only for law and order; it is in harmony with any and all general laws insofar as they protect the rights of others, and does in no manner recommend any acts in violation of present laws nor advocate <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> inimical to the public welfare. An African American clergyman named John T. Graves signed on as president of the new organization and Gerber, Graves and five others were listed as directors. The state granted the charter on December 24, 1924, making the Society the oldest documented homosexual organization in the nation. Despite deliberately keeping the goals of the Society vague and excluding any mention of homosexuality from its mission statement, Society members were still surprised that no one with the state investigated any further before issuing the charter.|$|E

25|$|In January 1968, Garrison subpoenaed Kerry Wendell Thornley – an {{acquaintance}} of Oswald's from their days in the military – to appear before a grand jury, questioning him {{about his relationship with}} Oswald and his knowledge of other figures Garrison believed to be connected to the assassination. Thornley sought a cancellation of this subpoena on which he had to appear before the Circuit Court. Garrison charged Thornley with perjury after Thornley denied that he had been in contact with Oswald in <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> since 1959. The perjury charge was eventually dropped by Garrison's successor Harry Connick Sr.|$|E

McCown testified that Peiper told him neither he nor his men were at any risk and that he (Peiper) was not accustomed to killing his prisoners. McCown noted that neither he nor his men were threatened in <b>any</b> <b>manner,</b> and he testified in Peiper's defence during the 1946 trial in Dachau.|$|E

When used in the latter context with the flags of other nations, {{the national}} flag should also be displayed in the place of honour on a nearby flag staff. Where multiple national flags are flown on festive occasions these should be of uniform dimensions. Bunting of the national colours may also be used on festive occasions.|$|E

25|$|As {{many of the}} {{contemporary}} theological journals published in Germany, Belgium and France make evident, Catholic theologians, rejecting Marxism, socialism, and the excesses of capitalism, debated and formulated social solutions that would come from the combined actions of the Church, the State, the employer and the employee, and elaborated in greater detail the principles {{to be used in}} seeking justice in industrial, social, and economic life. While Sheehan was aware of the social question of his time, and was actively engaged in the great contemporary social evolution directly affecting him in his parish, he can never be regarded as having in <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> espoused the Zeitgeist, as quickly emerges from his portrayal of such a priest in his novel Luke Delmege published in 1901 and, not surprisingly, translated into all of the major European languages.|$|E
25|$|Al-Mu'tazz's brother Abu Ahmad was put {{in charge}} of the Samarran forces at the {{beginning}} of the war. He was charged by the caliph with defeating al-Musta'in and Muhammad b. 'Abdallah, and was given the authority to command the army in <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> he pleased. Abu Ahmad's overall strategy was to keep Baghdad under constant attack from his troops, and to gain the surrender of the city by either assaulting it or starving its inhabitants until they lost the will to fight any longer. Toward this end, al-Mu'tazz sent armies to secure the neighboring towns that controlled access to Baghdad, and Abu Ahmad attempted to halt and seize any revenue shipments heading toward the city. The way in which Abu Ahmad ran the siege was not unquestionably accepted by al-Mu'tazz, who reportedly wrote him a letter in the middle of the war complaining of his lack of progress in forcing al-Musta'in's capitulation, but he remained in command of the main besieging force throughout the entire conflict.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the competition season, FIRST LEGO League sends official materials to each registered team, consisting of a 'challenge mat', LEGO bricks, and instructions for building the items for the mat (collectively known as the Challenge Set, formerly the Field Setup Kit). The teams also receive a list of tasks, called 'missions', to complete involving each model on the mat (i.e. taking a loose piece from one model and placing it inside another). FIRST LEGO League gives teams complete freedom on how to complete the missions, providing that they are completed by a programmed LEGO Mindstorms robot with no outside assistance. The robot has two and a half minutes to complete the missions. Each team has a minimum build period of 8 weeks to analyze the challenge mat, design and build a LEGO Mindstorms robot, and program it to fulfill the given missions in <b>any</b> <b>manner</b> they see fit. The robot must be autonomous, and may contain only one LEGO Mindstorms programmable block and no more than 4 motors.|$|E
