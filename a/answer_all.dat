The Syndicate meets over the capture of the Rebel. The Well-Manicured Man informs them of the existence of the Russian vaccine, believing that this makes resistance to the Colonists possible. If the vaccine is ineffective he proposes avoiding handing over the Rebel and instead forming an alliance with the Rebels, but the other Syndicate members believe this would be a suicidal course of action.|$|E

25|$|Gagarin and Seregin. 27 March 1968, Yuri Gagarin and Colonel Vladimir Seregin {{were killed}} {{on a routine}} {{training}} flight in a Mig-15UTI jet trainer. Enquiries continued {{for more than a}} year and did not produce a clear <b>answer.</b> <b>All</b> cosmonaut flight training was suspended. Kamanin, as the person ultimately responsible for cosmonaut training, received a formal reprimand; without Gagarin and without any prospects of winning the space race, his own influence and influence of AirForce on the space program deteriorated - while the American lunar program was steadily under way.|$|E
25|$|On the ACT, each {{question}} correctly answered is worth one raw point. There is no penalty for marking incorrect answers on the multiple-choice {{part of the}} test. Therefore, a student can <b>answer</b> <b>all</b> questions without suffering a decrease in their score for questions they answer incorrectly. This is parallel to several AP Tests eliminating the penalties for incorrect answers. To improve the result, students can retake the test: 55% of students who retake the ACT improve their scores, 22% score the same, and 23% see their scores decrease.|$|E

25|$|On August 11, Ethel Rosenberg {{testified before}} a grand jury.

Her attorney asked the U.S. Commissioner to parole her in his custody over the weekend, so that she could make arrangements for her two young children. The request was denied. Julius and Ethel were put under pressure to incriminate others involved in the spy ring. Neither offered any further information. On August 17, the grand jury returned an indictment alleging 11 overt acts. Both Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were indicted, as were David Greenglass and Anatoli Yakovlev.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{a counter}} {{is placed in}} the 24-hour-opened main {{entrance}} and a pistol-armed police officer would sit there as the station duty officer, or watch commander, on a 2-or-4-hour watch. The watch commander is the main funnel between that station and civilians within its area of responsibility. He or she {{is in charge of the}} safety of the station, including the security of firearms and ammunition. The station duty officer must <b>answer</b> <b>all</b> personal or telephone complaints from civilians, delegate those reports to proper desk police officers, dispatch police officers on patrol to respond, or provide legal advice to common citizens. Also, the station duty officer would reply to all information requests concerning suspicious persons or vehicles over radio communication.|$|E
25|$|While an {{election}} petition is pursued similarly to normal civil claims, a judge sitting in {{an election}} court holds more of a inquisitorial role. This inquisitorial power requires the judge to examine and investigate possible electoral malpractice in the electoral area as a whole {{as opposed to being}} limited to determining the questions posed by the petition. To aid its decision, the court has the power to require the attendance of any person as a witness, and to examine such a witness even if they are not called by either of the opposing parties. Witnesses are required to <b>answer</b> <b>all</b> questions posed to them, but none of their answers may be admitted as evidence against them in future court proceedings except in cases of perjury proceeding against the witness in respect of the evidence given.|$|E

25|$|I will {{no longer}} {{participate}} in this transparent ploy to gather media attention for Finkelstein and his publisher. I <b>answer</b> <b>all</b> of his charges fully in Chapter 16 of my forthcoming book The Case For Peace, {{to be published by}} Wiley in August. My book deals with important and current issues, such as the prospects for peace in the immediate future. Finkelstein's deals with the irrelevant past that both Israelis and Palestinians are trying to put behind them. Let the marketplace judge our books. As far as I'm concerned, the public controversy is over and I will comment no further on the false charges leveled by Finkelstein and the UCP. Let them henceforth pay for their own publicity, instead of trying to get it on the cheap by launching phony attacks against me.|$|E
25|$|One early {{application}} of knapsack algorithms {{was in the}} construction and scoring of tests in which the test-takers have a choice as to which questions they answer. For small examples it is a fairly simple process to provide the test-takers with such a choice. For example, if an exam contains 12 questions each worth 10 points, the test-taker need only answer 10 questions to achieve a maximum possible score of 100 points. However, on tests with a heterogeneous distribution of point valuesi.e. different questions are worth different point values {{it is more difficult}} to provide choices. Feuerman and Weiss proposed a system in which students are given a heterogeneous test with a total of 125 possible points. The students are asked to <b>answer</b> <b>all</b> of the questions {{to the best of their}} abilities. Of the possible subsets of problems whose total point values add up to 100, a knapsack algorithm would determine which subset gives each student the highest possible score.|$|E

500|$|Zacharias {{states that}} a {{coherent}} worldview {{must be able}} to satisfactorily answer four questions: that of origin, meaning of life, morality and destiny. He says that while every major religion makes exclusive claims about truth, the Christian faith is unique in its ability to <b>answer</b> <b>all</b> four of these questions. He routinely speaks on the coherence of the Christian worldview, saying that Christianity is capable of withstanding the toughest philosophical attacks. Zacharias believes that the apologist must argue from three levels: the theoretical, to line up the logic of the argument; the arts, to illustrate; and [...] "kitchen table talk", to conclude and apply. [...] Zacharias' style of apologetic focuses predominantly on Christianity's answers to life's great existential questions, with defense of God.|$|E
500|$|The Line is an American {{game show}} pilot co-hosted by Jeff Davis and Candace Bailey. Created by ITV Studios and {{produced}} by High Noon Entertainment, the pilot showcased contestants waiting in a [...] "line" [...] {{to enter a}} [...] "vault". While in the latter, they must answer a series of eight questions to win a jackpot that grows progressively as contestants fail to <b>answer</b> <b>all</b> eight correctly. While waiting in the line, they may be chosen to perform various challenges. These can earn them additional prizes and/or a move to the front or back of the line. Critical reception for the show was mixed; one writer argued that the show's pace of gameplay was too slow, but was also pleased to see an autistic contestant compete.|$|E
500|$|Hastings {{described}} {{his time as}} Attorney General as [...] "my idea of hell" [...] - {{he was the only}} Law Officer available, since the Solicitor General was not a Member of Parliament, and as a result had to <b>answer</b> <b>all</b> queries about points of law in Parliament. In addition, he had his normal duties of dealing with the legal problems of government departments, and said that the day was [...] "one long rush between the law courts, government departments and the House of Commons". His working hours were regularly between 7am and 5am the following morning, and the policemen on duty at the House of Commons complained to him that he was working too long, since they were required to stay on duty as long as he was.|$|E
