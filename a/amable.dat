40|$|Realised {{within the}} {{framework}} of the ESEMK project supported by the EU (FP 6, Priority 7, Contract CIT-CT- 2004 - 506077), the present study proposes a statistical analysis of the variety of the European socio-economic models integrating Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC) using Bruno <b>Amable’s</b> approach of the diversity of capitalism. The analysis relies on the theoretical design of institutional complementarities whose coherence defines the character of model of capitalism. The aim of this methodological study is to test the stability of <b>Amable’s</b> results when new countries are introduced (Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Turkey and one emerging country, Mexico, in order to diversify our sample), and to position the CEEC with respect to the European models already identified. Although the typology of the five capitalisms seems finally well resist to the introduction of new countries, it is however necessary to note some more dubious configurations on the side of European continental and Mediterranean models. Concerning the new introduced countries, the three Central European countries differs from the whole of the other models whereas Turkey is close to the Mediterranean model. variety of capitalism, institutional complementarities, Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC) ...|$|R
5|$|The {{blockade}} squadron off Lorient {{comprised the}} ships {{of the line}} HMS Theseus, HMS Triumph and HMS Valiant under Commodore John Poo Beresford, watching three ships in the harbour under Contre-amiral <b>Amable</b> Troude. At 15:15 Paget, who had {{lost sight of the}} French, reached the waters off Lorient and signaled a warning to Beresford. At 16:30, Beresford's squadron sighted Willaumez's fleet, tacking to the southeast. Willaumez ordered his second-in-command, Contre-amiral Antoine Louis de Gourdon to drive Beresford away and Gourdoun brought four ships around to chase the British squadron, with the remainder of the French fleet following more distantly. Beresford turned away to the northwest, thus clearing the route to Lorient. His objective achieved, Gourdan rejoined Willaumez and the fleet sailed inshore, anchoring near the island of Groix.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at Algeciras on 9 July, the {{combined}} squadron {{was ready to}} sail again on 12 July, departing Algeciras to the westwards during the evening. The British squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez, having effected its own hasty repairs, set off in pursuit. Finding that his ships were falling behind, Saumarez instructed his captains to separate and attack {{the combined}} squadron as best they were able to. The fastest ship was HMS Superb under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, which sailed through the Spanish rearguard as a moonless night fell. Superb fired on the rearmost ships, setting the 112-gun Real Carlos on fire and capturing the Saint Antoine. Unable to determine friend from foe in the darkness, Real Carlos inadvertently engaged the Spanish ship San Hermenegildo, spreading the fire to its compatriot. Both ships subsequently exploded with enormous loss of life. A second stage of the battle then developed, as HMS Venerable took {{the lead of the}} British line, attacking the rearmost French ship Formidable under Captain <b>Amable</b> Troude. In a furious and protracted engagement, Venerable suffered heavy damage and was driven ashore, allowing the remainder of the French force to return to Cadiz without further fighting.|$|E
5|$|In early 1809, the French sent {{a number}} of {{reinforcement}} convoys to their blockaded colonies {{in the hope of}} strengthening the garrisons before the British invasions began. Many ships, including four frigates, were lost in these missions and few reached their destinations successfully. Among these failed attempts was Troude's expedition to the Caribbean, which arrived in April 1809 at the Îles des Saintes. Finding that Guadeloupe was the only surviving colony, <b>Amable</b> Troude intended to anchor at Basse-Terre and unload his supplies, but was blockaded in the Îles des Saintes by a British squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane. Attempting to break out on 14 April, Troude led his main squadron northwest towards Puerto Rico while two en flûte frigates slipped out northeast to Basse-Terre, arriving safely. Troude's squadron was defeated on 17 April, but the frigates Félicité and Furieuse remained at Basse-Terre until 14 June, when they attempted to break out and return to France, laden with trade goods. The British blockade squadron were soon in pursuit and on 18 June the frigate HMS Latona captured Félicité without a fight. Furieuse was captured a month later in the North Atlantic. Félicité was 24years old and was therefore considered too antiquated for commissioning in the Royal Navy; instead she was sold to Henri Christophe to form the nucleus of the new Haitian Navy under the name Améthyste.|$|E
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis has stimulated much research about {{the resilience of}} neoliberalism. However, concrete mechanisms of neoliberal resilience are yet to be elaborated. This article elaborates such mechanisms by incorporating <b>Amable’s</b> notion of institutional hierarchy into Mahoney and Thelen’s gradual institutional change theory. In doing this, it provides a dynamic and politically grounded framework to analyze institutional resilience. Neoliberalism is maintained over time because dominant social blocs defend those policies and institutions that they perceive as more favorable to their interests (high-hierarchy institutions), while allowing degrees of freedom in those that matter less (low-hierarchy institutions). Four mechanisms account for the resilience of high-hierarchy institutions: marginal adjustment, solidification, accommodation and compromise. I explore the potential of this framework by comparing the trajectory of two related policy domains, exchange rates and industrial policy, in countries {{with a long history}} of neoliberal policymaking: Chile and Estonia...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{the paper}} is to {{classify}} the types of capitalism in the Balkan states {{in the context of}} the European post-socialist countries and identify the principal strengths and weaknesses of institutional organization in these countries. The paper uses <b>Amable’s</b> approach, which is supplemented by the influence of the political environment. The paper identifies two different capitalist clusters in the Balkan area: market economies (Bulgaria, Croatia, Montenegro and Romania) and hybrid economies (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Serbia). The Balkan countries are compared with the other post-socialist economies, the EU- 8 and post-soviet countries. Within the Balkan States, only Croatia and Montenegro are approaching the EU- 8 economies, while on the other hand, Albania has some characteristic in common with the Caucasian republics. In general, the Balkan States achieve better results than the post-soviet states; however, there are some common weaknesses: low quality of the education system and inefficient financial system, and rigid labour market in Albania, Croatia and Romania and underdeveloped political system in Bosnia and Herzegovina...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} undertakes {{a comparative}} investigation of national institutional patterns underlying environmental CSR, employee CSR, investor CSR, and social CSR. For this purpose, I draw on different case studies and comparative analyses {{to indicate the}} occurrence {{of the types of}} stakeholder CSR in the 21 considered countries. <b>Amable's</b> (2003) varieties of capitalism approach is used to classify the prevalence of five institutional characteristics for the countries of the sample. By means of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) (Ragin 1987; 2000), the causal links between certain institutional characteristics or combinations of characteristics (configurations) and the four types of stakeholder CSR are analysed. The QCA method is particularly well fit for fields displaying causal complexity and has been advocated for use in CSR research (Gond et al 2008; Gjolberg 2007). I point out several institutional complementarities between institutions and stakeholder CSR as well as the predominance of institutional configurations associated with coordinated market economies for environmental and employee CSR and the predominance of institutional configurations associated with liberal market economies for investor and social CSR. However, the most profoundly supported findings of the analysis are the complexity of institutional conditions and the prevalence of multiple causal paths leading to the different types of stakeholder CSR...|$|R
5|$|Keats {{meanwhile}} {{had engaged}} and defeated Saint Antoine, forcing the wounded Commodore Julien le Ray to surrender following {{an action that}} had lasted just half an hour. Casualties on Saint Antoine were heavy, although Superb had just 15 men wounded. The rest of the British squadron, following up in the darkness, mistook Saint Antoine as being still active, and all fired on the ship as they passed, intending to catch the remainder of Moreno's squadron as it sailed northwest along the Spanish coastline. At 04:00 the Formidable, now {{under the command of}} Captain <b>Amable</b> Troude, was seen to the north in Conil Bay near Cape Trafalgar and Saumarez sent Venerable to chase the French ship, Hood accompanied by Thames under Captain Aiskew Hollis. At 05:15, Venerable came within range and a close action soon followed, Hood ordering Hollis to bring his ship close to Troude's stern and open up a raking fire. Formidable had the better of the action however and at 06:45, with casualties mounting, Hood's mainmast collapsed over the side.|$|E
5|$|While Keats had {{remained}} with his prize Saumarez {{had led the}} remainder of the squadron forward, although Audacious had been left far behind the rest of the British force. The French and Spanish ships had scattered as Superb attacked the rearguard and during the night each made their way separately to the rendezvous off Cadiz harbour. As dawn broke at 04:00 on 13 July, lookouts on the leading British ship of the line Venerable under Captain Samuel Hood spotted the French ship Formidable, under the command of Captain <b>Amable</b> Troude in the absence of Linois, to the north. Formidable was trailing the rest of the squadron, close to the shore in Conil Bay to the south of Cadiz and north of Cape Trafalgar. The wind was light and coming from the land and so Caesar and Spencer, the latter being a long way behind the others, were unable to approach the French ship and it was left to Venerable and Thames, both inshore and therefore better able {{to make use of the}} wind, to lead the attack. Formidable had only jury topmasts following the battle on 6 July, and so Hood was able to rapidly approach the French ship, coming under fire from Troude's stern guns at 05:15, Hood holding off from replying until 05:20 so as to not delay his progress. The light breeze was at that point in Hood's favour, and Venerable was able to come close alongside Formidable and open fire with a full broadside. Off Cadiz, the remnants of Moreno's squadron formed up with the intention of sailing to Formidables aid, but were struck by a calm and could only watch the battle to the south.|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how the institutions of the new EU member states match with the institution types previously worked out for the old member states, and whether they resemble any of the broadly accepted four models of capitalism (Anglo-Saxon, Nordic, Continental European and Mediterranean) or represent a new type of model. <b>Amable's</b> work was regarded as the starting point of this study, which underpinned the existence of the four models with statistical analysis. As for the new member states, our cluster analysis indicated that a new, fifth model of Central and Eastern Europe could be determined. The characteristics of the Central and Eastern European model may be derived from three main factors: the lack of capital, weak civil society and the impact of the European Union and other international organisations influencing the new member states. Also owing to these factors, a special division of labour has developed between the old and the new, post-communist member states since the systemic change two decades ago, in which the present asymmetric interdependency can be long-lasting. This could also make the Lisbon-type strategies, which aim to develop the European integration into a set of innovation-driven economies, illusory in the long run. ...|$|R
40|$|After a {{synthetic}} {{presentation of the}} state of poverty and inequality {{in the world and the}} contradictions incurred by economic theory in this field after decades of globalization and in the midst of a persisting global crisis, in paragraphs 2. and 3. we outline the rational for our theoretical analysis, underlining two main aspects. First of all, in paragraph 2. we recall the reasons which makes inequality a multidimensional phenomenon, while in paragraph 3. we explore the reasons why the models of capitalism theory is relevant for studying multidimensional inequality. These paragraphs emphasise that inequality is a multidimensional and cumulative phenomenon and it should not be conceived only as the result of the processes of personal and functional distribution of income and wealth, which even by themselves are intrinsically multidimensional. The basic idea is that institutions, the cobweb of relations among them and their interaction with the economic structure define the model of capitalism which characterises a specific country and this, in turn, affects the level and the dynamics of inequality. This approach is consistent with the sociological approach by Rehbein and Souza (2014), based on the analytical framework developed by Pierre Bourdieu. In paragraph 4. we outline the rational for our empirical analysis, applying the notion of institutional complementarity and examining the relationship between institutional complementarity, models of capitalism and inequality. Besides, refining <b>Amable’s</b> analysis (2003), we provide empirical evidence on the relationship between inequality in income distribution and models of capitalism. Additionally, basing on cluster analysis, we identify six different models of capitalism in a sample of OECD countries, provide preliminary evidence on the different level of inequality which characterises each model and suggest that no evidence supports of the idea that a single model of capitalism is taking shape in this sphere in EU. In paragraph 5. we give some hints about issues in search for a new interpretation capable to fasten together the process of increasing inequality, the notion of symbolic violence and the models of capitalism theory. In the last paragraph we focus on conclusions useful for carrying on our research agenda...|$|R

He was a friend of André Masséna and knew what was happening at his headquarters even though Hardy was not there. During the summer, the French Directory planned to replace Masséna as leader of the Army of the Danube but later decided to confirm him as commander.

Jean Nicolas Houchard, {{the commander of}} the Army of the Moselle agreed to send <b>Amable</b> Henri Delaage with 10,500 men, but the force was only to hold the town for two days before withdrawing. Adam Philippe de Custine canceled Kilmaine's main offensive but allowed Beauregard to proceed with 2,000 soldiers. On 7 June Delaage's advanced guard appeared before Arlon but was repulsed. On the 8th Beauregard's column showed up and Delaage determined to try again. The French attacked on 9 June and defeated an Austrian division under Gottfried von Schroder. The Austrian force numbered 6,000 men in seven infantry battalions and eight cavalry squadrons. They sustained 600 casualties and lost five guns and four ammunition wagons.

Though the French held their ground, Masséna evacuated Zürich {{the next day}} and withdrew to a strong position overlooking the city. Altogether, Masséna commanded 76,781 troops. In Switzerland were infantry divisions under Claude Lecourbe (1st), Joseph Chabran (2nd), Jean-de-Dieu Soult (3rd), Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge (4th), Jean Victor Tharreau (5th), François Goullus (6th), Joseph Souham (7th) and Louis Marie Turreau (Valais), a cavalry division under Louis Klein and an infantry reserve under Jean Joseph <b>Amable</b> Humbert, plus occupation troops. The 6th and 7th Divisions were supervised by Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino while Lecourbe controlled the 1st and 2nd. Included in Masséna's command were Claude Juste Alexandre Legrand with 6,186 men and Claude-Sylvestre Colaud with 5,106 men watching the Rhine north of Strasbourg.

25|$|In 1808 Lapisse {{was made}} a Baron of the Empire with the title Sainte-Hélène and {{received}} the Order of the Iron Crown. By October of that year, Victor's I Corps was transferred to Spain {{to fight in the}} Peninsular War. Lapisse commanded the 2nd Division, made up of the same regiments as at Friedland, only with three battalions each. Lapisse fought at the Battle of Espinosa de los Monteros on 10 and 11 November 1808. On the 10th Eugène-Casimir Villatte recklessly threw his division at the Spanish army of Joaquín Blake y Joyes without waiting for Victor's other two divisions to arrive. The attack fell on the Division of the North which had recently escaped from Denmark and was repulsed. When Victor came up with his other two divisions, he sent one regiment of Lapisse's division and one brigade of Francois <b>Amable</b> Ruffin's division against the same defenders. Though Blake had to send reinforcements, the Spanish were able to drive off the French attackers. On the 11th Victor reasoned that Blake would expect his right flank to be attacked again, the same as the previous day. On this day, Lapisse launched an assault on the Spanish left flank on a very high ridge. This time the defenders were not of the same quality as the Division of the North. After their division commander and two brigadiers were wounded, the Spanish troops bolted for the rear. One of Lapisse's brigadiers, Nicolas Joseph Maison wheeled his troops against Blake's center just as Victor ordered a frontal attack by the rest of I Corps. The Spanish army disintegrated and took to the hills. Victor lost about 1,000 killed and wounded. The Division of the North suffered about 1,000 casualties while Blake's total losses were about 3,000. On 1 January 1809 Emperor Napoleon ordered Lapisse to detach from I Corps and operate in the Province of León. Two brigades of cavalry under Archange Louis Rioult-Davenay and Pierre-Honoré-Anne Maupetit were assigned to Lapisse's force. Despite Victor's pleas to return his 2nd Division, King Joseph Bonaparte obstinately refused.|$|E

The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo; others included Alphonse de Lamartine, Pierre Corneille, <b>Amable</b> Tastu, and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet.
