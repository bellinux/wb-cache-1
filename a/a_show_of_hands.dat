5|$|The {{returning}} officer, John Hall, after {{no other}} candidate came forward, asked for <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> and declared {{it to be}} in favour of Sewell, upon which Hart demanded a poll. Hall declared that the poll {{be held at the}} Town Hall the following day (19 January), from 9am to 4pm.|$|E
5|$|The {{presiding}} consul began each {{meeting with}} a speech on an issue, and then referred the issue to the senators, who discussed the matter by order of seniority. Unimportant matters could be voted on by a voice vote or by <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands,</b> while important votes resulted in a physical division of the house, with senators voting by taking a place {{on either side of}} the chamber. Any vote was always between a proposal and its negative.|$|E
5|$|Once a vote occurred, and {{a measure}} passed, {{he could do}} nothing, since his promise to {{physically}} interpose his person against the senators was now meaningless. In addition, during a couple of instances {{between the end of}} the Second Punic War in 201 BC {{and the beginning of the}} Social War in 91 BC, although they had no legal power to do so, several Consuls were known to have vetoed acts of the Senate. Ultimately, if there was no veto, and the matter was of minor importance, it could be voted on by a voice vote or by <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands.</b> If there was no veto, and the matter was of a significant nature, there was usually a physical division of the house, where senators voted by taking a place on either side of the chamber.|$|E
50|$|His {{first known}} carving {{was of a}} stone brought back from a holiday trip to Les Baux-de-Provence. A few years later, he held his first solo {{exhibition}} in 1961 at age 15, <b>a</b> <b>showing</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> carved animal sculptures (Provençal Stone) at the Prigent Gallery in Rouen.In 1966, at age 20, {{he got his first}} commission from a family friend and urban architect (Robert Louard) {{who was in charge of}} new construction on an island in Rouen.|$|R
50|$|Nominations {{take place}} at the chiefdoms. On the day of nomination, the name of the nominee is raised by <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> and the nominee is given an {{opportunity}} to indicate whether he or she accepts the nomination. If he or she accepts it, he or she must be supported by at least ten members of that chiefdom. The nominations are for the position of Member of Parliament, Constituency Headman (Indvuna) and the Constituency Executive Committee (Bucopho). The minimum number of nominees is four and the maximum is ten.|$|R
50|$|The {{by-election}} {{was caused}} by the resignation of incumbent MP Charles Brown and was won by John Lewthwaite. On nomination day (13 October) John Lewthwaite and Mr R. Pheney were nominated, and after <b>a</b> second <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> in favour <b>of</b> Lewthwaite, Pheney demanded a poll. John Lewthwaite was subsequently elected the following day.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the second}} day, the Seimas adopted a four-{{paragraph}} resolution. The first paragraph declared that the Tsarist government was Lithuania's most dangerous enemy. The second paragraph demanded autonomy; the third outlined the means towards this goal that were deemed acceptable. The resistance was to be peaceful and passive. The fourth and final paragraph demanded that children be taught in their native language by teachers chosen by the people. The Seimas, unlike the 1917 Vilnius Conference, did not attempt to elect an institution that could carry out these resolutions and act as a Lithuanian government. After the Seimas, rural areas were left on their own without central guidance. After the resolution was adopted by the Seimas, near midnight, Jonas Basanavičius read aloud his proposal to include an attachment condemning Polish ecclesiastical authorities for suppressing the use of the Lithuanian language in churches within the diocese of Vilnius. The church matters had not been discussed during the sessions, but the majority agreed to the proposal by <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands.</b> Because the attachment was not fully discussed, Social Democrats did not consider it officially adopted.|$|E
5|$|During sessions, {{members may}} speak after being called {{on by the}} President. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates. Partly due {{to the need for}} translation, and the {{politics}} of consensus in the chamber, debates tend to be calmer and more polite than, say, the Westminster system. Voting is conducted primarily by <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands,</b> that may be checked on request by electronic voting. Votes of MEPs are not recorded in either case, however; that only occurs when there is a roll-call ballot. This is required for the final votes on legislation and also whenever a political group or 30 MEPs request it. The number of roll-call votes has increased with time. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example, when the president is elected). All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the Official Journal of the European Union and can be accessed online. Votes usually do not follow a debate, but rather they are grouped with other due votes on specific occasions, usually at noon on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. This is because the length of the vote is unpredictable and if it continues for longer than allocated it can disrupt other debates and meetings later in the day.|$|E
5|$|On 6 July 2004 {{in an open}} letter, Sihanouk {{announced}} his plans to abdicate. At the same time, he criticised Hun Sen and Ranariddh for ignoring his {{suggestions on how to}} resolve the political stalemate of the past year. Meanwhile, Hun Sen and Ranariddh had agreed to introduce a constitutional amendment that provided for an open voting system, requiring parliamentarians to select cabinet ministers {{and the president of the}} National Assembly by <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands.</b> Sihanouk disapproved of the open voting system, calling upon Senate President Chea Sim not to sign the amendment. When Chea Sim heeded Sihanouk's advice, he was ferried out of the country shortly before the National Assembly convened to vote on the amendment on 15July. On 17July 2004, the CPP and FUNCINPEC agreed to form a coalition government, leaving SRP out as an opposition party. On 6October 2004, Sihanouk wrote a letter calling for the throne council to convene and select a successor. The National Assembly and Senate both held emergency meetings to pass laws allowing for the abdication of the monarch. On 14October 2004 the throne council unanimously voted to select Norodom Sihamoni as Sihanouk's successor. Sihamoni was crowned as the King of Cambodia on 29October 2004.|$|E
50|$|Voting at {{elections}} originally {{took place}} by way <b>of</b> <b>a</b> public <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> or by <b>a</b> public ballot. The {{right to vote}} by secret ballot was introduced by the Parliamentary and Municipal Elections Act 1872 (the Ballot Act 1872). After this voting took place at polling stations where voters marked their votes in secret and placed their ballot papers in a closed box.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{alternatives}} to the clap-o-meter exist. A studio audience can be polled by <b>a</b> simple <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands,</b> or for more visual impact by having them hold up different coloured cards indicating their vote. They can also be polled by electronic means using individual voting devices with buttons for each option. These options are more accurate than a clap-o-meter but lack the element of excitement generated by frenzied applause.|$|R
50|$|On February 23, 2009, an {{open meeting}} of about 75 people {{was held in}} Frazier Park {{under the control of}} Supervisor Watson. <b>A</b> poll by <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> {{revealed}} about 40 in favor of a MAC, 7 opposed, and 20 undecided, with others not voting.|$|R

25|$|The CNT {{generally}} avoids bringing {{matters to}} a vote, preferring consensus decision-making, which it {{considers to be}} {{more in tune with}} its anarchist principles. While pure consensus is plausible for individual base unions, higher levels of organizations cannot completely avoid the need for some type of vote, which is always done openly by <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
50|$|Under Liberal Party rules, any Liberal {{member of}} {{parliament}} or senator can propose a motion to spill the party's leadership. The leader of the party then invites {{a discussion of the}} motion at a party room meeting and makes a decision whether to call a vote on the matter based on the sentiments which are expressed. The leader chooses whether to conduct the vote through <b>a</b> public <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> or <b>a</b> secret ballot; historically it has been conducted by secret ballot.|$|R
50|$|Nominations {{take place}} at the chiefdoms. On the day of nomination, the name of the nominee is raised by <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> and the nominee is given an {{opportunity}} to indicate whether he or she accepts the nomination. If he or she accepts it, he or she must be supported by at least ten members of that chiefdom. The nominations are for the position of Member of Parliament, Constituency Headman (Indvuna) and the Constituency Executive Committee (Bucopho). The minimum number of nominees is four and the maximum is ten. Primary elections also {{take place at}} the chiefdom level. It is by secret ballot. During the Primary Elections, the voters are given an opportunity to elect the member of the executive committee (Bucopho) for that particular chiefdom. Aspiring Members of Parliament and the constituency Headman are also elected from each chiefdom. The secondary and final elections takes place at the various constituencies called Tinkhundla. Candidates who won primary elections in the chiefdoms are considered nominees for the secondary elections at inkhundla or constituency level. The nominees with majority votes become the winners and they become members of parliament or constituency headman.|$|R
50|$|One {{effective}} way of holding such a vote is to have audience members walk {{to the front of}} the theatre to choose either a black or white stone and place it in a bronze container. Voting by <b>a</b> public <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> - which was common in Athenian assemblies, but rare in Athenian trials - is not recommended, since a persuasive performance on the part of the actor playing the role of Socrates might encourage more audience members to vote in favour of Socrates’ acquittal than history allows.|$|R
25|$|Not surprisingly, Knibb {{was highly}} {{popular with the}} slaves. Not long {{afterwards}} the church in Falmouth needed a minister and Knibb's name was put forward. The missionary who chaired the meeting recorded that when he proposed Knibb should be their new minister and asked for <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands,</b> the entire membership stood up, held up both hands, and wept.|$|E
25|$|Forsaith and Reader Wood contested {{a vacancy}} in the City of Auckland electorate. The {{nomination}} meeting on 26 April 1858 sparked little interest. <b>A</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> was {{in favour of}} Forsaith, and Wood called for a poll. The election was held {{the next day and}} Forsaith was elected. Parliament at the time was in session, and he took the oath on 28 April, being welcomed back by the speaker.|$|E
25|$|The tense {{situation}} {{began to}} boil over. A mass meeting was called, which was addressed by Ford and Herman Suhr, an IWW member who was acting {{as secretary of}} the temporary Durst Farm local. Other speakers addressed the crowd in the German, Greek, Italian, Arabic, and Spanish languages. <b>A</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> indicated that a large majority of pickers at the meeting were in favor of a strike. The crowd remained peaceful and sang Wobbly songs through the afternoon.|$|E
50|$|Flannery is {{a bridge}} {{convention}} using an 2 opening bid to <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> minimal opening bid strength (11-15 high card points) with exactly four spades and five (or sometimes six) hearts. It {{was invented by}} American player William L. Flannery.|$|R

25|$|Unlike the Democratic caucus, the Republican Party {{does not}} use voting rounds or have minimum {{requirements}} for a percent of votes. The Republican version is done with a straw vote of those attending the caucus. This vote is sometimes done by <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> or by dividing themselves into groups according to candidate. However, officially it is done with voters receiving a blank {{piece of paper with}} no names on it, and the voter writing a name and placing it in a ballot box.|$|E
25|$|The National Congress {{assembled}} in the morning. It first voted to accept Zelaya's resignation letter, dated 25 June, which Zelaya denied signing. It studied a special report on Zelaya, and by <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands,</b> the National Congress – the majority of whom belonged to Zelaya's own Liberal party – appointed the President of the National Congress Roberto Micheletti, a member of Zelaya's party, to be president to succeed Zelaya. Noteworthy that the president changed his political leanings during his administration, from right to left, which earned him the antipathy by his party colleagues.|$|E
25|$|Voters were {{required}} to have a £40 freehold, in addition to requirements related to age, sex, and religion. The £40 freehold requirement was often ignored. Jews {{were not allowed to}} vote between 1737 and 1747. In rural counties slightly more than half the males could vote. No secret ballot safeguarded the independence of the voters. The elections were held at the county town, {{under the supervision of the}} sheriff and sometimes at such short notice that many of the voting population could not get to the polls. The candidates were usually at the polls and the vote was taken by <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> unless this vote did not result in a clear winner.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concert was}} {{initiated}} by independent guitarist/producer Brendan Phillips, who had asked Steven Prestwich, drummer {{of the legendary}} iconic Australian band Cold Chisel if they would consider performing at a one off benefit concert {{to raise funds for}} the families of those effected by the fires. Although Cold Chisel did not end up performing at the concert, Steve had loved the idea, and very soon <b>a</b> vast <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> was offered from many well known Australian and International bands and other music industry figures, venues, production companies, etc, who quickly offered their enthusiasm and support for the monumental concert.|$|R
50|$|The 2-D covers {{were new}} to these {{publications}} and perfectly embodied their 3-D theme. The first, by Kurtzman, <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> skull-littered corridor collapsing into the distance.

25|$|While Forza Italia {{had never}} held a formal party {{congress}} to formulate its rules, procedures, and democratic balloting for candidates and issues, (since 1994 three party conventions of Forza Italia have been held, {{all of them}} resolving to support Berlusconi and reelecting him by acclamation) on 27 March 2009, at the foundation congress of the People of Freedom political movement the statute of the new party was subject to a vote of approval. On 5,820 voting delegates, 5,811 voted in favour, 4 against and 5 abstained. During that political congress Berlusconi was elected as Chairman of the People of Freedom by <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands.</b> According to the official minutes of the congress the result favoured Berlusconi, with 100 per cent of the delegates voting for him.|$|E
25|$|The supreme {{organ of}} the party is its congress, which is summoned by the {{outgoing}} central committee and held every four years.

The congress approves its theses after a wide discussion period inside the organizations and may also change the party's programme and statutes. All {{the decisions of the}} congress are made by the delegates voting. With the exception of the voting for the central committee, which a recent Portuguese law requires to be secret, all voting, including the approval of the theses, are conducted by <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> <b>hands.</b> The theses, after approval, guide all the party's political actions and stances until the next congress.|$|E
25|$|Each jury {{member of}} each {{national}} jury {{will make a}} ranking of his ten favourite songs and award points from 1 to 8, 10 and 12 points.

5000|$|The Demoex {{system is}} a {{political}} hybrid which uses e-democracy to inject direct democracy into a system of representative democracy. This creates a semi-representative democracy, similar to {{one that has been}} used in Switzerland since the late 19th century. [...] In pure direct democracy, there are no representatives, or there are only proxy representatives with limited power. By contrast, in a representative democracy, the elected representatives have all the power to make political decisions. The Swiss Landsgemeinde {{is one of the oldest}} and purest forms of direct democracy. [...] It was originally introduced in the Swiss Canton of Uri in 1231, and was structured as an open-air gathering, usually in springtime, where votes were expressed by <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> raised <b>hands.</b> This system is still used in the Canton of Glarus and Appenzell Innerrhoden.|$|R
