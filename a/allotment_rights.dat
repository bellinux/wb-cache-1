50|$|System {{of water}} rights: If {{there is a}} {{rationing}} system in which senior rights users get all of their <b>allotment</b> before junior <b>rights</b> users get any of theirs under drought conditions (priority system), there is little incentive for senior users to conserve if they can’t easily trade water to other users. This complicates trading because heterogeneous rights must be quantified and priced for each trade, and is less adaptable to short run changes in supply.|$|R
5000|$|Federal {{projects}} can overrule {{this state}} system, {{and this is}} true for the Colorado-Big Thompson Project (CBT). The CBT Dam is a Bureau of Reclamation irrigation project where a water market has developed, and is based on a proportional rights system. This market has been in operation since the early 1960s, and has well-developed infrastructure to move water within the area of service. There are market prices, brokers, short term rentals and permanent leases of water in this system, and trades within the agricultural sector and between the agricultural and municipal and industrial sectors.Water rights are homogeneous and trades are in allotments of the use of [...] (for 1 year) of the [...] per year of water supplied by the CBT; and each acre-foot is a tradable <b>allotment.</b> Water <b>rights</b> are thus well defined, and understood by traders. Supplies are also reliable, and the delivery of water assured- users know what they are getting. The CBT was developed to supply water that is supplemental to a users main supply (to reduce variability in supplies), so in wet years the quota is cut back proportionally for all shareholders to save for drier years. Similarly, if there is less than [...] available for a given year, all supplies are cut back proportionally. Additionally, conserved water can be transferred to another use, which is not the case in prior appropriation systems. Water can also be rented to users outside the district through exchanges and replacements and internal ditch companies also trade non-CBT water, though transaction costs are higher for these. Rental prices are less than allotments, because of the higher risk of unavailability, and make up 30% of transactions.|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands {{the task}} of reintegrating {{partially}} disabled workers into the labour market, {{that used to be}} accomplished by collective institutions, has been redistributed by the government to private actors: those who were the last to employ these workers. It is pointed out that this policy choice implies reusing a medieval legal technique and that its use regenerates typical legitimacy problems. Building on Ostrom’s theory of ‘institutions for collective action’, a historical comparison of the organization of dyke maintenance in the Dutch bog peat areas of the 11 th- 13 th centuries and of these recent policies reveals that both are to be analysed in terms of a ‘double allotment’: duties as to collective tasks are allotted to individual participants in a collectivity by linking them up with a preceding <b>allotment</b> of usage <b>rights,</b> legally formalized in terms of ‘private law’. While neoliberal ideology may account for the direction that recent reintegration policies have taken, {{it is only in the}} Netherlands that this legal technique has to such an extent been mobilized. This observation raises questions as to long-term continuities in Dutch policies...|$|R
40|$|Globally {{management}} agreements {{have emerged}} as more effective in assuring long-term nature conservation on private land, than regulatory mechanisms alone. Restrictive permanent covenants in particular, which are legally binding management agreements in perpetuity, have been adopted in most States and Territories in Australia. However, there is reluctance among landholders to take them up. Sound understanding {{of the factors that}} influence the decisions of landholders regarding the uptake of permanent covenants is important in planning and strategizing for increased covenant uptake. The aim of this thesis is to further this understanding and to support the design of a coordinated covenant mechanism for nature conservation on private lands in Australia. This thesis postulated that the decision of landholders regarding the uptake of permanent covenants could be explained within the theoretical framework of landholders’ adoption of land and agricultural conservation practices and technologies. Three self-administered questionnaires were employed in this study through mail surveys on three groups of landholders in two Australian States (Victoria and Western Australia) : one for permanent covenant holders, another for fixed-term agreement and fixed-term covenant holders in Victoria and Western Australia respectively, and another for non-holders of covenant or agreement holders in both States. Data, both qualitative and quantitative were collected on demographics, social-economics, landholders’ attitudes, and property characteristics. The data analysis included frequency distributions and proportions, analysis of variance, multivariate regression path analysis, and content analysis of written views of landholders on incentives and disincentives for covenant uptake. Landholders’ decisions regarding uptake of a permanent covenant are influenced directly, and/or indirectly by several interactive factors categorised into five non-mutually exclusive constructs: landholders’ confidence in permanent covenant mechanisms, nature conservation ethic, outlook on property rights, level of economic dependence o the property, and nature conservation equity. In both States, there is lack of comprehensive knowledge about permanent covenant, leading to negative perceptions about the purpose, intentions, and ability of permanent covenants to deliver the desired outcomes, and these affect landholders’ confidence in permanent covenants. In addition, misconceptions and misunderstanding abound on the rights attached to private property and the relationship between these rights and permanent covenants. Furthermore, policy measures to compensate for loss of landholders perceived property rights are likely to induce relatively similar measure of response to permanent covenant uptake among all landholder categories. There is a need for clarification of the <b>allotment</b> of property <b>rights</b> over biological resources that have a public good on private property among the different claimants. Voluntary uptake of management agreements mostly attracts the landholders who are least economically dependent on their property and those who have a high conservation ethic and appreciation of conservation values on their property. The presence of the economic dependent category of landholders justifies the use of financial incentives to motivate their uptake of permanent covenants. Recent amendments to the taxation law to address loss in land value are likely to have disproportionate magnitude of impact of conservation policy on different landholder groups, confirming the need for a pre-implementation policy impact assessment on the relevant landholder groups. There is risk of comprehensive policy framework for nature conservation on private land to address the complex issues that affect private conservation efforts. Development of incentive measures that ensure sustained motivation to conserve nature and a gradual shift from compensatory approaches to stewardship support measures are necessary. In views of the trans-generation and transferability of land, programs that promote a nature conservation ethic need to move beyond current landowners to potential future ones. Extension programs can address perceived disadvantages to, and losses to be incurred by landholders caused by, taking up a permanent covenant. Extension programs and policies that clarify the connection between biodiversity on private land, landowners’ goals and aspirations, and the link between human wellbeing and the healthy maintenance of the environment can encourage a value and ethic for nature conservation and in turn motivate the uptake of permanent covenants and land stewardship. Clarification to landholders {{of the importance of the}} biodiversity on a specific property to the overall regional and national biodiversity plans and needs, and the importance and value of a specific landholder’s contribution to conserving biodiversity are necessary to motivate the uptake of permanent covenants...|$|R
5000|$|The State of New Mexico has {{entrusted}} {{its water}} rights governing to a State-appointed position, {{that of the}} Water Engineer. The role of this position is to not only facilitate the exchanges of water rights that occur, but also monitor the aquifer levels as resources are consumed. In 2003, the state of New Mexico implemented a Water Plan, which sought to protect the <b>allotment</b> of water <b>rights,</b> but also consider the associated water supply and quality, the relationships between sellers and buyers, State requirements, and promotion of future investment in infrastructure.New Mexico must {{be responsible for the}} management of its own resource supply, as the inability to do so will require the surrender of authority to the federal level of administration. To ensure effective guidance in sales and trades, many state departments and commissions are engaged in the efforts. Each of these parties is delegated roles and responsibilities aimed towards best planning and management of State and Regional water exchanges. The New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission and the Office of the State Engineer are two leading parties, but included in this council are the New Mexico Environment Department, the Water Quality Control Commission, the New Mexico Acequia Commission, and the Water Trust Board, among others. These groups work in conjunction with one another to ensure water right implementation, potential pollutants, developing databases and information systems, and fulfill other roles that lead to efficient use of New Mexico’s water resources.The state of New Mexico honors the system of prior-appropriation water rights. In this [...] "first in time, first in right" [...] system, many of the original recipients of water access rights were Pueblos and Tribes. As sovereign states, these groups are entitled to their senior rights, which are then governed on a federal level rather than state. Because of the uniqueness of these rights, any policy decisions that may affect these Tribes and Pueblos must be presented by the State for discussion with these parties.The state of New Mexico mandates that any rights with a common hydrological source be formally adjudicated through a court proceeding, documenting the full legal and physical quantification of the rights. This is accomplished with the purpose of assisting the State Water Engineer in allocating water allotments across the spread of State demands and those with senior rights. The rights held by Pueblos and Tribes must also be adjudicated to establish the legal parameters of their water access. Under the McCarran Amendment, these rights must be defined and quantified under federal law in order to be evaluated as part of the stream-associated water rights administration.Because of the nearly complete allocation of surface waters in New Mexico, efforts have been made to increase the water supply available to the expanding needs of the State. In order to do this, groundwater is reserved in aquifers that are connected to rivers throughout the state. Reclaiming these stores would diminish the river flows which would thus reduce the water available to senior rights holders. The solution here is the purchase and retirement of these senior surface rights. This will begin a new emphasis on the groundwater resources that have been stored for future access.The Office of the State Engineer occupies a critical role in New Mexico’s water trading system. This administrator will establish a prior appropriation assessment of water rights in part with a priority administration plan of action The State Engineer is provided with funding for investments in technology, such as water measuring and metering, GIS units, surface and groundwater models, and manuals.To aid in the fulfillment of these and additional requirements of the State Water Engineer, New Mexico has recently implemented an [...] "active resource management" [...] plan. In this platform, a state-appointed staff is assigned roles in identifying, measuring, and metering water rights, facilitating transfers, and appointing district water masters. Water masters operate within established water districts in administering rights as necessary. Each basin team includes a project manager, hydrologist, attorney, communication manager, personnel manager, and technical support staff.The full responsibilities of the active resource management plan along with the Office of the State Water Engineer are diagrammed in the 2003 Water Plan, as well as the 2006 Progress Report and 2008 Review and Proposed Update. The ideals of this proposal are clearly identified and accompanied by methods of execution and public opinion. While comparatively young, this program is aggressively seeking out efficient allocation and use of New Mexico’s water supply.New Mexico considers all water to be public property. Right to use, however, is a possession that may be purchased or leased. Once allocated to a party, failure to put to beneficial use for period of time (commonly 4 years) may lead to rights being reclaimed by the State. Upon reclamation, these rights may then be sold or leased to another interested party. The rights may be obtained through application of a permit through the Office of the State or through a personal water attorney.|$|R
