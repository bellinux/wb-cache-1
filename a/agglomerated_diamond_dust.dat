40|$|Atmospheric {{observations}} from active remote sensors and surface observers, {{obtained in the}} western Arctic Ocean between November 1997 and May 1998, were analyzed to determine the physical characteristics and to assess the surface radiative contribution of <b>diamond</b> <b>dust.</b> The observations showed that <b>diamond</b> <b>dust</b> contributed only a negligible radiative effect to the sea ice surface. Surface radiative fluxes and radiative forcing values during <b>diamond</b> <b>dust</b> events were similar in magnitude when compared to observed clear-sky periods. Combined information from lidar, radar, and surface observers showed that <b>diamond</b> <b>dust</b> occurred; 13 % of the time between November and mid-May over the Arctic Ocean and was not observed between mid-May and October. <b>Diamond</b> <b>dust</b> vertical depths, derived from lidar measurements, varied between 100 and 1000 m but were most often observed to be about 250 m. Lidar and radar measurements were analyzed to assess if precipitation from boundary layer clouds was present during times when surface observers reported <b>diamond</b> <b>dust.</b> This analysis revealed that surface observers had incorrectly coded <b>diamond</b> <b>dust</b> events; 45 % of the time. The miscoded events occurred almost exclusively under conditions with limited or no illumination (December–March). In 95 % of the miscoded reports, lidar measurements revealed the presence of thin liquid water clouds precipitating ice crystals down to the surface. 1. Introduction an...|$|R
50|$|<b>Diamond</b> <b>dust</b> is a {{ground-level}} cloud {{composed of}} tiny ice crystals. This meteorological phenomenon is {{also referred to}} simply as ice crystals and is reported in the METAR code as IC. <b>Diamond</b> <b>dust</b> generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so it is {{sometimes referred to as}} clear-sky precipitation. It is most commonly observed in Antarctica and the Arctic, but it can occur anywhere with a temperature well below freezing. In polar regions <b>diamond</b> <b>dust</b> may continue for several days without interruption.|$|R
50|$|While <b>diamond</b> <b>dust</b> {{can be seen}} in {{any area}} of the world that has cold winters, it is most {{frequent}} in the interior of Antarctica, where it is common year-round. Schwerdtfeger (1970) shows that <b>diamond</b> <b>dust</b> was observed on average 316 days a year at Plateau Station in Antarctica, and Radok and Lile (1977) estimate that over 70% of the precipitation that fell at Plateau Station in 1967 fell in the form of <b>diamond</b> <b>dust.</b> Once melted, the total precipitation for the year was only 25 mm.|$|R
50|$|<b>Diamond</b> <b>dust</b> {{is similar}} to fog {{in that it is}} a cloud based at the surface; however, it differs from fog in two main ways. Generally fog refers to a cloud {{composed}} of liquid water (the term ice fog usually refers to a fog that formed as liquid water and then froze, and frequently seems to occur in valleys with airborne pollution such as Fairbanks, Alaska, while <b>diamond</b> <b>dust</b> forms directly as ice). Also, fog is a dense enough cloud to significantly reduce visibility, while <b>diamond</b> <b>dust</b> is usually very thin and may not have any effect on visibility (there are far fewer crystals in a volume of air than there are droplets in the same volume with fog). However, <b>diamond</b> <b>dust</b> can often reduce the visibility, in some cases to under 600 m.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Diamond</b> <b>dust,</b> {{also known}} as ice needles or ice crystals, forms at {{temperatures}} approaching -40 C due to air with slightly higher moisture from aloft mixing with colder, surface based air. [...] They are made of simple ice crystals that are hexagonal in shape. [...] The METAR identifier for <b>diamond</b> <b>dust</b> within international hourly weather reports is IC.|$|R
50|$|To form <b>diamond</b> <b>dust</b> the {{temperature}} must be below the freezing point of water, 0 C, or the ice cannot form or would melt. However, <b>diamond</b> <b>dust</b> {{is not often}} observed at temperatures near 0 C. At temperatures between 0 C and about -39 C increasing the relative humidity can cause either fog or <b>diamond</b> <b>dust.</b> This is because very small droplets of water can remain liquid well below the freezing point, a state known as supercooled water. In areas {{with a lot of}} small particles in the air, from human pollution or natural sources like dust, the water droplets are {{likely to be able to}} freeze at a temperature around -10 C, but in very clean areas, where there are no particles (ice nuclei) to help the droplets freeze, they can remain liquid to -39 C, at which point even very tiny, pure water droplets will freeze. In the interior of Antarctica <b>diamond</b> <b>dust</b> is fairly common at temperatures below about -25 C.|$|R

Each girl believes in a myth of snow turning into <b>diamond</b> <b>dust,</b> and if one makes a wish on the <b>diamond</b> <b>dust,</b> their wish is 100% guaranteed to come true. Another myth about <b>diamond</b> <b>dust</b> {{is that if a}} boy and girl meet under the dust, they're guaranteed happiness and marriage later in life.

50|$|The series {{began with}} Kita e: White Illumination (北へ。White Illumination), which was {{released}} on March 18, 1999 for the Dreamcast. A fan disc, Kita e: Photo Memories (北へ。Photo Memories), {{was released on}} August 5 that same year. On October 30, 2003, the series hit the PlayStation 2 platform as Kita e. ～Diamond Dust～ (北へ。～Diamond Dust～) was released. A sequel to <b>Diamond</b> <b>Dust,</b> Kita e: <b>Diamond</b> <b>Dust</b> + Kiss is Beginning came out October 28, 2004. An anime series entitled Kita e. ～Diamond Dust Drops～ (北へ。～Diamond Dust Drops～) was adapted from the two <b>Diamond</b> <b>Dust</b> games. The anime was released in the United States by ADV Films under the title Diamond Daydreams in three volumes and later in a thinpack re-release.|$|R
50|$|<b>Diamond</b> <b>dust</b> {{is often}} {{associated}} with halos, such as sun dogs, light pillars, etc. Like the ice crystals in cirrus or cirrostratus clouds, <b>diamond</b> <b>dust</b> crystals form directly as simple hexagonal ice crystals — as opposed to freezing drops — and generally form slowly. This combination results in crystals with well defined shapes - usually either hexagonal plates or columns - which, like a prism, can reflect and/or refract light in specific directions.|$|R
50|$|The {{depth of}} the <b>diamond</b> <b>dust</b> layer can vary {{substantially}} from as little as 20 to 30 m to 300 m. Because <b>diamond</b> <b>dust</b> does not always reduce visibility it is often first noticed by the brief flashes caused when the tiny crystals, tumbling through the air, reflect sunlight to your eye. This glittering effect gives the phenomenon its name since it looks like many tiny diamonds are flashing in the air.|$|R
