40|$|We {{study the}} optimal (i. e. revenue maximizing) <b>auction</b> of {{multiple}} <b>products.</b> We make three major points.

A monopolist setting prices for multiple products may offer discounts on purchases of bundles of products; similarly, the optimal <b>auction</b> of multiple <b>products</b> facilitates price discrimination by allocating products inefficiently to customers {{who are willing to}} purchase both products. Second, we demonstrate that optimal auctions are qualitatively distinct from monopoly sales of multiple products. Because of uncertainty about the values of other consumers, two products are bundled probabilistically in an optimal auction for a customer who is willing to buy both of them. A customer may then receive a discount on a lower-valued product without receiving a higher-valued product. Third, we show that in an optimal <b>auction</b> of two <b>products</b> the allocation of one product may vary with the amount of competition for the other product. 1...|$|R

We firstly present an optimization model for a price-taker hydrothermal generation company (Genco) to devise bidding strategies in multi-item iterative auctions of long-term contracts. The bidding model calculates a bidder's best-response function, which {{takes into account the}} key issues on the auctioned contracts, such as its time horizon, the risk factors that affect the future contract outcomes, interdependence between <b>auctioned</b> <b>products,</b> and the agents' risk profile. The risk profile of the Gencos are represented as piecewise linear utility functions and a practical specification approach is proposed. We finally present a simulator of a uniform-pricing and iterative multi-item contract auction, where the set of auction rules is implemented and the optimization model developed is used to determine the Gencos's best responses at each auction round. The simulator enables auctioneers and generators to estimate the auction's competitive equilibrium price and to study the auction dynamics.

We emphasise the similarity between this model and existing models of competition in horizontally differentiated markets. Finally we illustrate conditions for the existence and the stability of such equilibrium. To this end we extend the model to a dynamic setting in which a sequence of independent auctions takes place. We assume bidders have bounded rationality in a twofold sense. On one hand, they use an underparametrized model of their competitors' behaviour, best responding to expectations on average bids rather than keeping track of the entire vector of competitors' bids. On the other they update expectations adaptively. In a general framework with more than two bidders the system may fail to converge to the steady state, i. e. to the symmetric Nash equilibrium of the original game.

Much extant research on 1 Carol Saunders was the accepting senior editor for this paper. Lucas Introna was the associate editor. Mike Chiasson and James Backhouse served as reviewers. Internet auction fraud in the information systems literature is conducted at the individual level of analysis, thereby limiting its focus to the choices of individual traders or trading dyads. The criminology literature, in contrast, recog-nizes that social and community factors are equally important influences on the perpetration and prevention of crime. We employ social disorganization theory as a lens to explain how online auction communities address auction fraud and how those communities interact with formal authorities. We show how communities may defy, coexist, or cooperate with the formal authority of auction houses. These observations are supported by a qualitative analysis of three cases of online anticrime communities operating in different <b>auction</b> <b>product</b> categories. Our analysis extends aspects of social disorgani-zation theory to online communities. We conclude that community-based clan control may operate in concert with authority-based formal control to manage the problem of Internet auction fraud more effectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the economic benefits of country of origin labeling (COOL) regulation by estimating the consumer's willingness to pay (WTP) for Taiwan products vs. other imported products if clearly labeled with their countries of origin. We employ the Vickrey second-price sealed bid auction and conducted auctions in three major cities in Taiwan in 2009. Charcoal-smoked plums from Taiwan and China and oolong teas from Taiwan, China, and Vietnam are <b>auctioned</b> <b>products.</b> One important feature of our experimental design is to investigate the impacts of product tasting on bidding behavior. We estimated Tobit bid models and the OLS premium functions. The regression results show that product tasting affected the participants' WTP positively or negatively depending on products. Specifically, tasting raised bids for Taiwan and China teas, but lowered bids for Vietnam tea. The econometric results show very high premiums for Taiwan products, ranging from 83 % to 109 % for tea and 55 % to 66 % for charcoal-smoked plum. These findings clearly show strong preference of Taiwanese consumers over food and agricultural products produced domestically. It is very important to have rigorous COOL regulation in Taiwan. If all foods and agricultural products are clearly labeled with their countries of origin, Taiwanese consumers and food producers stand to benefit greatly with COOL. The COOL would be one of the best instruments to reduce the negative impacts of agricultural trade liberalization under WTO or ECFA. ...|$|R

Many countries depend part of their annual GDP on tourism and especially Europe which is the major destination of worldwide tourism. According to World Tourism Organization (WTO) [1] Europe holds more that half of the global tourism traffic. The structure of {{tourism industry}} includes a lot of different involved actors and the value chains developed are in general long and complex. This is due to the special attributes of the tourist product which involve a lot of decisions with limited amount of information at hand. In fact the industry is very information intensive.

Ubiquitous computing though, did not only offer new channels of information distribution but paved the road for old applications to evolve into a completely new and different service offering.

40|$|Agribusinesses {{have been}} {{investigating}} alternative methods {{for food and}} agriculture production {{as a way to}} differentiate their product to consumers. Although experimental auctions have increasingly become a popular tool for gathering information about consumers and their valuations of differentiated products, little is known about their valuations for vegetables that are grown using different methods and few studies have simultaneously studied external validity and the influence of outside prices. This study investigates consumers? valuations of different agricultural production methods and provides a unique method for studying whether consumers? purchasing behavior reflects their willingness to pay. Additionally, it provides insight into the relationships between consumers? valuations and their prestige-seeking behavior and health-consciousness. A Vickrey 2 nd price auction was conducted and immediately followed by the introduction of an on-site secondary market that used induced value theory and the retail prices of the <b>auction</b> <b>products</b> in surrounding stores in the Bryan-College Station area of Texas. Several econometric models were thereafter estimated using data collected from the experiment; however a random parameters tobit model proved to be most appropriate due to the heterogeneous nature of the data. Results indicate that consumers express deep discounts for red colored lettuce. While tasting the products did not have an impact on valuations, consumers did express significant premiums for organic lettuce after they learned about hydroponic lettuce production and the growing methods of the products were revealed. The same can be said for valuations of mixed lettuce, which was hydroponically grown. Consumers were also categorized using three applications of Latent Class Analysis and responses to scale-style questions about health-consciousness and prestige-seeking buying behavior. The willingness to pay for lettuce was estimated using a random parameters tobit model for each latent class in each application. In addition to advancing the understanding of consumers? valuations of horticultural production methods, this study contributed to the external validity of experimental auctions. By using an on-site secondary market, it was discovered that consumer surplus and the relative importance of the compensation fee affect an individual?s behavior in the experiment setting...|$|R
