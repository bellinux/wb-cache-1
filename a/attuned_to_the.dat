5|$|The Pacific {{angelshark}} {{is primarily}} a visual hunter; experiments in nature show that they strike at fish-shaped targets without any electrical, chemical, vibrational, or behavioral cues. At night, they are guided by the bioluminescence of planktonic dinoflagellates and ostracods disturbed by moving prey. This species' visual system is <b>attuned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wavelengths of light emitted by these planktonic organisms, showing the importance of night hunting. Pacific angelsharks {{are more likely to}} strike at prey approaching from the front. It usually waits until the prey approaches to , as its attack is less accurate beyond this distance. The strike is a stereotyped behavior in which the shark presses the forward lobes of its pectoral fins against the bottom and thrusts its head upwards at up to a 90° angle. Its mouth forms a tube when opened, creating a suction force, while its jaws protude forward to secure the prey between sharp teeth. During the strike, the eyes roll backward into the head for protection. The strike is often completed in under a tenth of a second.|$|E

25|$|So, from a {{time before}} the {{composition}} of Kol Nidrei there was a corresponding ritual intended for Rosh Hashana. It is believed that Kol Nidrei {{was added to the}} liturgy of Yom Kippur, ten days after Rosh Hashana, because that service is much more solemn, because the Day of atonement is entirely <b>attuned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theme of repentance and remorse, and because (despite the great importance of Rosh Hashana) Yom Kippur services are better attended, and perhaps because Yom Kippur itself is once referred to as Rosh Hashana in Scripture (Ezekiel 40:1). Such reasons were enumerated by, among others, Asher ben Jehiel (early 14th century). There may be an additional reason — perhaps the annulment of vows was moved to, or repeated at, the commencement of the Day of Atonement in order to minimize the risk that new vows would be made in the ten-day interval between the repudiation of vows in Rosh Hashana and the Day of Atonement, and, more than the rather dry legalistic Rosh Hashana declaration, Kol Nidre includes an emotional expression of penitence which sets the theme for the Day of Atonement.|$|E

25|$|The 2000 tournament {{was held}} in Sri Lanka, and {{replicated}} the format from 1998. Participating nations included the nine Test-playing nations, as well as Bangladesh, Kenya, Ireland, Namibia, Holland, Nepal and a combined team from the Americas development region. To the disappointment of a large crowd at Colombo's SSC, Sri Lanka fell at the final hurdle in a final dominated by India. The winners remained unbeaten throughout, and destroyed Australia by 170 runs in the semi-final to underline their supremacy. In the other semi-final, Sri Lanka delighted a crowd of 5000 at Galle by beating Pakistan. The fact {{that three of the}} four semi-finalists were from Asia and so more <b>attuned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conditions was coincidental - they played the better cricket and, in Pakistan's case, had a very experienced squad. England, the defending champions, were most disappointing, and they won only one match against a Test-playing country, and that a last-ball victory over Zimbabwe. South Africa, one of the favourites, were desperately unlucky to be eliminated after three no-results gave them three points while Nepal, with four points courtesy of one win over Kenya, went through to the Super League instead. The format of the tournament was as in 1997-98, with four groups of four and then a Super League and final. Graeme Smith was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 348 runs at an average of 87.00. Pakistan's Zahid Saeed was the leading wicket-taker, with 15 wickets at 7.60. India's Yuvraj Singh was named Man of the Series.

40|$|Abstract — Music {{performance}} is an important, wellstructured setting for evaluating a robot’s ability to detect, understand and respond appropriately to complex human activity. Social {{tasks such as}} cooperative performance require participants to detect, interpret and <b>attune</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> actions of their partners quickly and accurately. The synthesis of multiple sensory perceptions may be a fruitful approach to this problem. In order to evaluate this approach, we programmed a humanoid robot, Nico, to play a drum in concert with human drummers and {{at the direction of}} a human conductor. Our results show that sensory integration can enable precise synchronization in social tasks even when perceptual data is imperfect, misleading and subject to extensive processing delay. By integrating several streams of information – visual, auditory, and proprioceptive – Nico can <b>attune</b> <b>to</b> a tempo that is set by a human conductor, in concert with human performers. Nico continuously evaluates its perceptions of its own actions and those of the humans around it, dealing with unforeseen changes in tempo and affect in real time. I...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{a rhythmic}} sense comes early in {{childhood}} development, and appears crucial for learning speech {{as well as}} music. Synchronized, rhythmic movements governed by oscillators play significant roles in industrial robots, but only in tightly controlled, precisely defined environments.

30|$|Laser {{manufacturers}} are nowadays {{driven by the}} wide variety of laser applications to build compact and robust devices that are able to perform in more stringent conditions [1]. To fulfill such demands, the common assembling techniques using clamping or adhesive means have to be substituted with more sophisticated approaches which enable components miniaturization (making them unsuitable for clamping methods), and more robust manufacturing that could offer a higher operational thermal range, vacuum compatibility or even <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> withstand space radiation (making them unsuitable for adhesive techniques) [2]. Techniques such as solderjet bumping can <b>attune</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> utilization of a minimized input of thermal energy, allowing for the assembly of brittle materials such as glasses, crystals or ceramics.

500|$|According to Lacombe, [...] is {{characteristic}} of French opéra lyrique, in particular through Bizet's use of arioso and dramatic recitative, his creation of atmospheres, and his evocation of the exotic. Berlioz described the opera's score as beautiful, expressive, richly coloured and full of fire, but Bizet himself did not regard the work highly, and thought that, a few numbers apart, it deserved oblivion. Parisian critics of the day, <b>attuned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gentler sounds of Auber and Offenbach, complained about the heaviness of Bizet's orchestration, which they said was noisy, overloaded and Wagnerian—"a fortissimo in three acts". The conductor Hans von Bülow dismissed the work contemptuously as [...] "a tragical operetta", {{and when it was}} revived after 1886, resented having to conduct it. Modern writers have generally treated the piece more generously; the music may be of uneven quality and over-reflective of the works of Bizet's contemporaries, says Dean, but there are interesting hints of his mature accomplishments. Others have given credit to the composer for overcoming the limitations of the libretto with some genuinely dramatic strokes and the occasional inspiring melody.|$|E
500|$|According to Canard, Husayn [...] "stands {{out more}} clearly than the supreme {{commander}} Mu'nis or any other military leaders" [...] of the period for his ability and valour, {{as well as for}} his restive and ambitious spirit.

Canard assesses him as unusually open-minded, and <b>attuned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ideological turmoil and ferment in the Muslim world of his time, as indicated by his contact with the Sufi mystic al-Hallaj, who dedicated a work on politics to Husayn. Indeed, according to Canard, Husayn's espousal of Shi'ism, and his participation in the abortive coup of 908, can best be seen in light of a desire—typical of Shi'a sympathisers—for a renewal of the Caliphate and the establishment of an [...] "ideal Muslim government", something which the corrupt and decadent Abbasids were no longer capable of. Finally, although it fell to his brother to found the actual Hamdanid dynasty, it was Husayn who first gave his family a taste of power and glory, for which he was later celebrated in the poetry of Abu Firas.|$|E
