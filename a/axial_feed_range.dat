40|$|Abstract: Hydroforming is a {{cost-effective}} way of shaping ductile metals such as aluminum, brass, low alloy steels, stainless steel into lightweight, structurally stiff and strong pieces. The <b>axial</b> <b>feed</b> and internal pressure {{are very important}} parameters for tube hydroforming. Based on the original machine and sensors installed in this machine, the master-slave mode is used for controlling the <b>axial</b> <b>feed</b> of {{the right and left}} punches. By detecting displacement of the punch, one punch should trace another punch and realize the coordination motion control. On the other hand, adapting to add electro-hydraulic proportional valve on the low-pressure side and the internal pressure is set by users. The experiment results demonstrate that the control strategies proposed in this paper can meet the needs of manufacturing. Copyright © 2013 IFSA...|$|R

40|$|Tube {{hydroforming}} is {{a developing}} technology with advanced features of lightness and unified part. This study investigates {{the best possible}} regulation for loading conditions between the internal pressure and the <b>axial</b> <b>feeding</b> by hydroforming of a T-shape metal tube. Using conjugate gradient method with finite element method, a program module is generated to check the hydroformed tube quality about its thickness uniformity and the geometry accuracy. Thereby, a batch mode and a sequential mode to optimize the loading conditions of the tube hydroforming process are created and investigated. Regarding the tube quality from the simulation results, the hydroforming process, which follows the loading curve generated by the sequential mode, is better than by the batch mode. The optimal loading procedure generated by this article can offer another possibility for engineer by determining the internal pressure and the <b>axial</b> <b>feeding</b> in tube hydroforming.

5000|$|Designing {{the process}} {{has in the past}} been a {{challenging}} task, since initial analytical modeling is possible only for limited cases. Advances in FEA and FEM in recent years has enabled hydroform processes to be more widely engineered for varieties of parts and materials. Often FEM simulations must be performed in order to find a feasible process solution and to define the correct loading curves: pressure vs. time and <b>axial</b> <b>feed</b> vs. time. In the case of more complex tube hydroformed parts the tube must be pre-bent prior to loading into the hydroforming die. Bending is done sequentially {{along the length of the}} tube, with the tube being bent around bending discs (or dies) as the tube length is fed in. Bending can be done with or without mandrels. This additional complexity of process further increases the reliance on FEM for designing and evaluating manufacturing processes. The feasibility of a hydroforming process must take into consideration the initial tube material properties and its potential for variation, along with the bending process, hydraulic pressure throughout the forming process, in inclusion of <b>axial</b> <b>feed</b> or not, in order to predict metal formability.|$|R

The process is usually used to produce accurate threads or threads in hard materials; a common application is ball screw mechanisms.

Center-type infeed thread grinding use a grinding wheel with multiple ribs that is longer than the length of the desired thread.

Gears have been generated with full depth of cut and with two <b>axial</b> <b>feed</b> with constant cutting speed value. During hobbing cutting forces have been measured by experimental stand. Tool wear has been measured directly as a width of flank wear land of the hob cutter teeth.

A constant length of cut parameter has been established as a criteria value. Results of investigation have been presented in the form of graphs describing changes of wear land width parameter in comparison to the most loaded tooth wear land parameter.
