5|$|The Confederate {{ordnance}} establishment <b>at</b> <b>Little</b> Rock was reactivated in August, 1862.

5|$|There is {{evidence}} of human settlement <b>at</b> <b>Little</b> Thetford since the Neolithic Age. A 1996 search along the Anglian Water pipeline <b>at</b> <b>Little</b> Thetford—Cawdle Fen uncovered an important and unusually dense concentration of late Neolithic (3000–2201BC) remains. This is unusual because, although the fenland basin was dry and forested during the Mesolithic era, the area was sometimes subject to marine incursions, and at other times, fresh-water flooding. This led to marshes and open water areas {{which may have been}} difficult to settle on—except perhaps for seasonal activity. A Neolithic polished flint axe (4000–2201BC) was found in the village in 1984 at Bedwell Hey Farm. Fourteen pre-Roman flints of various finishes were also discovered in 1998 at the same site.|$|E
5|$|A more {{substantial}} Bronze Age settlement {{is known to}} have existed; the remains of what may have been a causeway were discovered in 1934, in the form of wooden piles unearthed by a farmer between Little Thetford and nearby Barway.

There {{have been a number of}} Bronze Age finds in the area, including a pre–701BC palstave at nearby Fordey farm, Barway, and <b>at</b> <b>Little</b> Thetford, a middle Bronze Age (1600–1001BC) rapier in 1953, and a late Bronze Age flesh-hook in 1929.|$|E

5|$|From March 2007 until November 2012, Folding@home took {{advantage}} of the computing power of PlayStation 3s. At the time of its inception, its main streaming Cell processor delivered a 20x speed increase over PCs for some calculations, processing power which could not be found on other systems such as the Xbox 360. The PS3's high speed and efficiency introduced other opportunities for worthwhile optimizations according to Amdahl's law, and significantly changed the tradeoff between computing efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing the use of more complex molecular models <b>at</b> <b>little</b> added computing cost. This allowed Folding@home to run biomedical calculations that would have been otherwise infeasible computationally.|$|E
