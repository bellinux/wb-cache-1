5|$|The Scene is the Palace of Cupid, compos'd of wreath'd Columns of the Corinthian Order; the Wreathing is adorn'd with Roses, and the Columns {{have several}} little Cupids flying about 'em, {{and a single}} Cupid {{standing}} upon every Capital. At a good distance are seen three Arches, which divide the first Court from {{the other part of}} the Building: The middle Arch is noble and high, beautified with Cupids and Festoons, and supported with Columns of the foresaid Order. Through these Arches is seen another Court, that leads to the main Building, which is at a mighty distance. All the Cupids, Capitals and Inrichments of the whole Palace are of Gold. Here the Cyclops <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> at a forge, forging great Vases of Silver. The Musick strikes up, they dance, hammering the Vases upon Anvils. After the Dance, Enter Vulcan.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{thousands}} of boys {{were employed in}} glass making industries. Glass making was a dangerous and tough job especially without the current technologies. The process of making glass includes intense heat to melt glass (3133°F). When the boys <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> {{they are exposed to}} this heat. This could cause eye trouble, lung ailments, heat exhaustion, cut, and burns. Since workers were paid by the piece, they had to work productively for hours without a break. Since furnaces had to be constantly burning, there were night shifts from 5:00pm to 3:00am. Many factory owners preferred boys under 16 years of age.|$|E
25|$|The {{first attempt}} to model the {{distribution}} of galaxies with a fractal pattern was made by Luciano Pietronero and his team in 1987, and a more detailed view of the universe’s large-scale structure emerged over the following decade, {{as the number of}} cataloged galaxies grew larger. Pietronero argues that the universe shows a definite fractal aspect over a fairly wide range of scale, with a fractal dimension of about 2. The fractal dimension of a homogeneous 3D object would be 3, and 2 for a homogeneous surface, whilst the fractal dimension for a fractal surface is between 2 and 3. The ultimate significance of this result is not immediately apparent, but it seems to indicate that both randomness and hierarchal structuring <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> on the scale of galaxy clusters and larger.|$|E

[...] Harrison also supported a bill proposed by Senator Henry W. Blair, which would have granted federal funding to schools regardless of the students' races. He also endorsed a proposed constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court ruling in the Civil Rights Cases (1883) that declared much of the Civil Rights Act of 1875 unconstitutional. None of these measures gained congressional approval.|$|E
500|$|In his 1989 book Wonderful Life, Stephen Jay Gould {{argued that}} if one could [...] "rewind the tape of life [...] the same {{conditions}} were encountered again, evolution could take a very different course". Simon Conway Morris disputes this conclusion, arguing that convergence is a dominant force in evolution, and given that the same environmental and physical constraints <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> life will inevitably evolve toward an [...] "optimum" [...] body plan, and at some point, evolution is bound to stumble upon intelligence, a trait presently identified with at least primates, corvids, and cetaceans.|$|E

500|$|The artists Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian {{founded the}} De Stijl movement, which {{they wanted to}} [...] "establish a visual {{vocabulary}} [...] elementary geometrical forms comprehensible by all and adaptable to any discipline". Many of their artworks visibly consist of ruled squares and triangles, sometimes also with circles. De Stijl artists worked in painting, furniture, interior design and architecture. After the breakup of De Stijl, Van Doesburg founded the Avant-garde Art Concret movement, describing his 1929–1930 , a series of four black squares on the diagonal of a squared background, as [...] "a structure that can be controlled, a definite surface without chance elements or individual caprice", yet [...] "not lacking in spirit, not lacking the universal and not... empty as there is everything which fits the internal rhythm". The art critic Gladys Fabre observes that two progressions <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in the painting, namely the growing black squares and the alternating backgrounds.|$|E

They visit the American Museum of Natural History. He admits that he told friends {{he was going to}} [...] "do it" [...] with her, but that he thinks of her as a little sister. Feeling ill, Sally runs to the bathroom and finds blood on her underwear. Arriving home, Megan looks for Sally and sees Glen's duffel bag. Sally takes a cab to the Francis house and sprints to the bathroom. She later hugs Betty tightly and explains that her menstrual cycle has started. Glen shows up at the Draper apartment and tells Megan that Sally left him at the museum. Betty phones and tells her that Sally [...] "became a woman today," [...] and just needed her mother. Megan insists Glen stay until she can drive him to his train. Betty gives Sally a hot water bottle and assures her that starting her cycle means [...] "everything is working." ...|$|E
500|$|For the Golden Gate International Exposition of 1939–1940 on Treasure Island, Pflueger {{joined a}} {{committee}} of well-known Beaux-Arts architects and was frustrated in establishing a more modern design scheme, though his own Federal Building amply demonstrated the new direction he espoused. Pflueger's contributions were among the few buildings at the Exposition that received positive reviews. When the Exposition's investors failed {{to turn a profit}} in 1939, they decided to extend the fair another year. For the summer of 1940, Pflueger put together a large exhibit of Art in Action, showing a number of artists on display, engaged in creating works. Alfred Frankenstein of The New York Times visited in June and wrote [...] "Here the visitor is privileged to observe a kind of twenty-ring circus of art... On the floor, in a series of little ateliers, sculptors, painters, lithographers, etchers, ceramicists, weavers and whatnot <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> under the direct observation of the public." [...] Pflueger once again brought Diego Rivera to San Francisco, this time to serve as the main attraction at [...] "Art in Action". Rivera painted Pan American Unity on ten steel-framed panels spanning 74 feet in width and reaching 22 feet in height. For the second time, Rivera included Pflueger in a mural of his. Some 68 artists had participated by the end of September when the Exposition was closed. Rivera was not finished, however; he and two assistants labored for two more months in the empty exposition hall. On November 30 and December 2, 30,000–35,000 visitors came to Treasure Island to view the completed mural. On December 8, 1940, Rivera's 54th birthday, Kahlo and Rivera were married {{for the second time in}} a civil ceremony at San Francisco City Hall.|$|E
