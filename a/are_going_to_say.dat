500|$|At a {{dialogue}} on {{the changes to}} the Elected President scheme on 15 September 2016, Law Minister K. Shanmugam addressed the allegation, saying: [...] "sk yourself logically, [...] do we, as a Government, do what is right, based on the system, or do we worry [...] some people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this is to knock out people we don't like? You know, more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you think we {{know who they are}} and we can make sure that they are all going to be OK? It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E
500|$|In 2009, before Rowland and Guetta collaborated for [...] "When Love Takes Over", {{the media}} {{reported}} that Columbia Records and Rowland were to part ways by mutual agreement. However in a 2010 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Rowland stated {{the decision to}} leave was not hers: the label ended their contract because singles from the previous record Ms. Kelly did not sell sufficiently well. After the release of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] she {{would go on to}} fire Matthew Knowles. It has since been suggested Rowland had fallen out with former fellow Destiny's Child singer Beyoncé Knowles. The media reported that Knowles' decision to release one more video ("Why Don't You Love Me") from her album I Am... Sasha Fierce just before Rowland released [...] "Commander" [...] was unfair on Rowland. These claims would be denied by the singer who said that despite the clip for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] airing several days before [...] "Commander", the media was [...] "making too much of a big deal of release schedules and trying to create a feud where it doesn't exist." [...] She also said, [...] "we all came out {{at the same time and}} it really doesn't matter... I think there's room for everybody... There's Bey, there's Ciara putting something out and [...] GaGa putting something out, but, because we started out together, people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> things like that.

The controversial story of Luke raping Laura had quickly been renounced to a seduction at the time, after facing pressure from fans of the newly popular couple. In 1998, Pat Fili-Krushel, then President of Daytime Programming for ABC Daytime, explained to The New York Times: [...] "What we felt we should investigate is how, as the famous saying goes, {{the sins of the}} father are visited on the children." [...] Head writer at the time Robert Guza, Jr. commented to the Associated Press: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> certainly, that the son is dealing with rape in a much better way, a much more appropriate way, and a much healthier way, than the father did." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, after {{unsuccessful}} {{efforts to}} persuade Washington state {{government officials to}} provide funding to update KeyArena, the Basketball Club of Seattle LLP, led by Howard Schultz, sold the team to the Professional Basketball Club LLC (PBC), an investment group headed by Oklahoma City businessman Clay Bennett. The purchase, at US$350 million, also included the Seattle Storm WNBA franchise. Schultz sold the franchise to Bennett's group because they thought that Bennett would not move the franchise to Oklahoma City but instead keep it in Seattle. Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett was quoted as saying, [...] "I think it's presumptuous to assume that Clay Bennett and his ownership group won't own that Seattle team for a long, long time in Seattle or somewhere else. It's presumptuous to assume they're going to move that franchise to Oklahoma City", Cornett said.

[...] On Pet Sounds and other work, author Jim Fussili observed a repeated nuance of Wilson's to [...] "wander far from the logic of his composition only to return triumphantly to confirm the emotional intent of his work". Tony Asher remembers: [...] "one of the things that I really enjoyed, was that first time I'd hear him hunting for a chord change and I'd think 'Man, he's just gone right off the edge because he's not ever gonna get close. He's way out there in some area that's just—he'll never get back. And if he's successful, gets out of there, people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> I've lost my tone center, don't know where the hell I am and stuff.
