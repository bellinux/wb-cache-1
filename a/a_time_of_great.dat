By the 1970s, Greyhound had moved its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona and was a large and diversified company, with holdings in everything from the Armour meat-packing company (which in turn owned the popular Dial deodorant soap brand), acquired in 1970; Traveller's Express money orders, MCI bus manufacturing company, and even airliner leasing. Indeed, Greyhound had entered <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> change, even beginning to hire African American and female drivers in the late seventies.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{holding a}} {{monopoly}} on cases in the Court of Common Pleas, Serjeants also took most of the business in the Court of King's Bench. Although required to make the Common Pleas their principal place of work, {{there is evidence of}} Serjeants who did not; one, Robert Mennell, worked entirely in the North of England after his creation in 1547 and was not known in Westminster, where the Common Pleas was located. This was also <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> judicial success for the Serjeants; since only Serjeants could be appointed to the common law courts, many also sat in the Exchequer of Pleas, a court of equity. This period was not a time of success for the profession overall, however, despite the brisk business being done. The rise of central courts other than the Common Pleas allowed other lawyers to gain advocacy experience and work, drawing it away from the Serjeants, {{and at the same time}} the few Serjeants could not handle all the business in the Common Pleas, allowing the rise of barristers as dedicated advocates.|$|E
5|$|In {{the rear}} of the main {{entrance}} hall is a series of six dioramas illustrating communications and the press throughout Indonesian history. The first diorama shows various forms of communication and news-sharing in pre-colonial Indonesia. The second diorama shows the press in the colonial period, including the first newspaper in the Indies under the Dutch East India Company, Memories der Nouvelles (1615); the first printed newspaper in the Indies, the Bataviasche Nouvelles (1744), and the first Javanese newspaper in the Indies, Bromartani (1855). The third diorama depicts the press during the Japanese occupation, whereas the fourth depicts the press during the National Revolution– including the formation of the PWI. The fifth diorama shows the state of the press during the New Order under President Suharto, <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> press censorship. The final diorama depicts the press after the beginning of Reformasi in 1998, in which greater freedom of the press has been granted.|$|E

The humanizing (or ‘reformist’) Left accepts the world in its present form, taking the market economy and globalization as unavoidable, and attempts to humanize their effects through tax-and-transfer policies.|$|R
5|$|Mallory's tenure on the Committee on Naval Affairs {{came during}} <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> {{innovation}} in naval warfare. He kept abreast of developments in other navies, {{and he made}} sure that the U.S. Navy would incorporate the latest thinking into its new ships. Britain and France, then the two foremost navies in the world, {{were in the process}} of converting their fleets from sail to steam, and from paddles to screws. In 1853, the committee recommended passage of a bill providing for the addition of six new screw frigates to the fleet; when delivered, some considered them to be the best frigates in the world. In 1857, his committee persuaded the Senate to authorize twelve sloops-of-war. These entered the navy beginning in 1858, on the verge of the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The end of {{the eighteenth}} century was <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> hope for {{progressive}} reformers such as Wollstonecraft. Like the revolutionary pamphleteer Thomas Paine and others, Wollstonecraft was not content to remain on the sidelines. She sought out intellectual debate at the home of her publisher Joseph Johnson, who gathered leading thinkers and artists for weekly dinners, and she traveled extensively, first to be a part of the French revolution and later to seek a lost treasure ship for her lover in what was then exotic Scandinavia, turning her journey into a travel book, Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. After two complicated and heart-rending affairs with the artist Henry Fuseli and the American adventurer Gilbert Imlay (with whom she had an illegitimate daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Together, they had one daughter: Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein. Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38 due to complications from this birth, leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. Today, she is most often remembered for her political treatise A Vindication of the Rights of Woman and is considered a foundational feminist philosopher.|$|E
5|$|The late 17th {{century in}} England was <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> {{progress}} in design. Following the austere years of Commonwealth rule, a great flourishing {{and development in}} both architecture and the arts began after {{the restoration of the}} monarchy in 1660. Royalist exiles and wealthy young men who made the Grand Tour, returned home with new ideas—often extravagant variations on classical themes. This was, for England, the dawn of the Baroque era. The new wave of architects such as Roger Pratt, John Webb, and Sir Christopher Wren were not just building vast edifices in Renaissance-inspired styles, but also transforming existing older houses. Representative of the utilisation of older houses is Coleshill House in Berkshire, where Pratt transformed the medieval, but now redundant, great hall into a classically inspired entrance hall complete with an imperial staircase. Great Halls were considered redundant now that employers wished to live separately from their servants, and no longer ate with them in a Great Hall. All evidence and odours of cooking and staff were banished from the principal parts of the house. Employers began to live in fine airy rooms, above the ground floor, with privacy from their servants, who were now confined, unless required, to specifically delegated areas—often the ground and uppermost attic floors. This was a period of great social change in British history, and the educated prided themselves on enlightenment and elegance. While Belton is not in the Baroque style, it displays all the traits typical of the new tendencies.|$|E

Most of his work in Ireland consisted of religious buildings. Pugin demanded the highest quality of workmanship from his craftsmen, particularly the stonemasons. His subsequent visits to the country were brief and infrequent. He was the main architect of St. Aidan's Roman Catholic Cathedral for the diocese of Ferns in Enniscorthy, Co.Wexford.|$|R

50|$|Following her {{failures}} at Fort William and Mary, {{her involvement}} in Thompson’s War {{and the continued}} insurrection permeating thought the maritimes and New England’s coast, HMS Canceaux resumed the activities typical of a Royal Navy ship <b>of</b> the <b>time.</b> Her activities were primarily focused upon patrolling the coastline and preventing the illegal trade activities supported by colonial forces. Throughout the summer she fulfilled said function in order to enforce the laws and weaken the American efforts at insurrection. She captured many ships thought the summer including those smuggling between colonial ports and even those smuggling internationally. She habitually escorted captured ships and impressed crewmen regularly. While this period represents <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> far <b>greater</b> success for HMS Canceaux in securing the region and subordinating the colonial forces and ships, it is also <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>greater</b> cruelty, at least when viewed through {{the perspective of a}} colonist. The norms inherent to the impressment of adversarial crews and the regular seizure property engrained the societal hatred of the British naval forces and had engendered mutual hatred between Henry Mowat and the colonial forces.|$|R
40|$|During the {{perinatal}} period, {{the nervous}} system is very vulnerable to insult. At this time, the brain undergoes fast and complex maturational processes such as synaptogenesis, arborization, and apoptosis, and {{the response to the}} insult is highly dependent on its exact timing. There is evidence that some of the neuroplastic mechanisms adopted by the young brain after damage are unavailable at a later stage of maturation. This applies, for example, to the reorganization of language, the sensorimotor system, or the visual system. Expanding our knowledge on these mechanisms could help the development of early therapeutic interventions aimed at supporting and enhancing functional reorganization at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>greatest</b> potential brain plasticity...|$|R

National accounts data for 31 sectors in the economy show that the fall in aggregate volatility is mostly a result of lower covariance between sectors rather than individual sectors becoming less volatile.
