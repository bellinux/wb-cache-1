5000|$|Introduced {{in early}} 1992 for the 1993 model year, Allanté was scaled {{down to just}} one model this year, the soft-top {{convertible}} priced at $59,975 (not including a mandatory $1,700 gas guzzler tax for vehicles sold in the United States). The removable 60.5 lb. aluminum hardtop was now a separate option, {{as well as the}} $495 LCD digital instrument cluster in place of the standard analog instruments. A $700 pearlcoat paint option (in Flax or Canyon Yellow, with Hawaiian Orchid added midyear) was available. Also optional were chrome squeeze-cast aluminum wheels. For its final model year, Allanté received the 4.6 L Northstar DOHC V8 engine. This engine was rated at [...] at 5600 rpm. Torque output was 290 ftlb Nm at 4400 rpm. A new unequal-length control arm rear suspension, shared with the Seville and Eldorado, was also introduced that year. Also new for the small Cadillacs was Road Sensing Suspension, an <b>active</b> <b>damper</b> management system, and revised disc brakes. The 1993 model used GM's Delco [...] "Premium Symphony Sound System". Other changes for the Allanté included a revised variable-assist power steering rack, deeper front spoiler, and single-piece side windows, which did away with the stationary forward vent window. Production for 1993 was the highest. Of the 4,670 Allantés manufactured for the 1993 model year, 115 were for export - France (1), Austria (2), Belgium (5), Germany (5), Switzerland (6), Japan (11), and Canada (85).|$|E

40|$|Tests are {{performed}} on a flexure-pivot-pad tilting-pad bearing {{with a series}} integral squeeze film damper in load-between-pads configuration, with both active and locked damper. The damper effects are negated when locked, resulting in a flexure-pivot-pad bearing only. Experimental tests provide static performance data and dynamic stiffnesses from which rotordynamic coefficients are extracted. The following two excitation schemes are implemented: (1) multi-frequency, single direction excitation and (2) single-frequency, rotating load excitation (or "circular excitation"). The XLTRC 2 Rotordynamics Software Suite provides stiffness and damping coefficient, eccentricity, and power loss predictions for the locked damper bearing. Test conditions include the rotor-speed range of 4000 - 12000 rpm and the unit-load range of 0 - 862 kPa (0 - 125 psi). Dynamic tests utilizing the multi-frequency excitation for the locked and <b>active</b> <b>damper</b> bearing configurations both show that the real portion of the dynamic stiffness is well modeled by a quadratic curve fit, and the imaginary portion representing the damping is a linear function of excitation frequency. This means that frequency independent coefficients can be obtained when an added mass term is included. While stiffness coefficients are lower for the <b>active</b> <b>damper</b> bearing, damping coefficients remain almost constant between the locked and <b>active</b> <b>damper</b> configurations. A simulation shows that, although the damping coefficients do not change significantly, the reduced stiffness provided by the damper results in greater effective damping. Static performance tests for the locked and <b>active</b> <b>damper</b> bearing indicate low cross-coupling, {{as shown by the}} eccentricity and low attitude angle measurements. Pad metal temperature measurements show a smaller temperature differential along the pad arcs for the <b>active</b> <b>damper</b> bearing, than observed for the locked damper case.

40|$|A {{promising}} way {{to increase}} the suppression of vibration in mechanical systems is to apply active damping instead of passive damping, which is most widespread today. An <b>active</b> <b>damper</b> system consists of an actuator, a controller {{and at least one}} sensor, usually an accelerometer. The sensor measures the vibration and sends the measurements further to the controller in order to calculate the necessary damping force to be fed back to the mechanical system. A number of questions arises regarding <b>active</b> <b>damper</b> design, namely how to construct the <b>active</b> <b>damper,</b> what kind of sensors to use and where to place them, how to model the vibration and the mechanical system itself, and, last but not least, how to design the controller. This licentiate thesis deals with the controller design issue. The most widely used controller in active vibration control is the Filtered-X Least Mean Square Controller and it is briefly reviewed in this thesis. The main focus of the thesis is however on another structure, the External Model Controller (EMC). The EMC has much more degrees of freedom than the Filtered-X Controller but lacks performance and robust stability analysis as well reliable design methods. The four papers included in the thesis contribute to bridging this gap. Godkänd; 2001; 20070228 (ysko...|$|E
