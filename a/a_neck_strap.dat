5|$|The {{cluster of}} keys {{at the bottom}} of the upper joint (protruding {{slightly}} beyond the cork of the joint) are known as the trill keys and are operated by the right hand. These give the player alternative fingerings that make it easy to play ornaments and trills. The entire weight of the smaller clarinets is supported by the right thumb behind the lower joint on what is called the thumb-rest. Basset horns and larger clarinets are supported with <b>a</b> <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> or a floor peg.|$|E
25|$|The bassoon is held diagonally {{in front}} of the player, but unlike the flute, oboe and clarinet, it cannot be easily {{supported}} by the player's hands alone. Some means of additional support is usually required; the most common ones are a seat strap attached {{to the base of the}} boot joint, which is laid across the chair seat prior to sitting down, or <b>a</b> <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> or shoulder harness attached to the top of the boot joint. Occasionally a spike similar to those used for the cello or the bass clarinet is attached to the bottom of the boot joint and rests on the floor. It is possible to play while standing up if the player uses <b>a</b> <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> or similar harness, or if the seat strap is tied to the belt. Sometimes a device called a balance hanger is used when playing in a standing position. This is installed between the instrument and the neck strap, and shifts the point of support closer to the center of gravity, adjusting the distribution of weight between the two hands.|$|E
25|$|Polo saddles are English-style, close contact, {{similar to}} jumping saddles; {{although}} most polo saddles lack a flap under the billets. Some players {{will not use}} a saddle blanket. The saddle has a flat seat and no knee support; the rider adopting a forward-leaning seat and closed knees dissimilar to a classical dressage seat. A breastplate is added, usually attached to the front billet. A standing martingale must be used: so, a breastplate is a necessity for safety. The tie-down is usually supported by <b>a</b> <b>neck</b> <b>strap.</b> Many saddles also have an overgirth. The stirrup irons are heavier than most, and the stirrup leathers are wider and thicker, for added safety when the player stands in the stirrups. The legs of the pony are wrapped with polo wraps from below the knee to the fetlock to minimize pain. Jumping (open front) or gallop boots are sometimes used along with the polo wraps for added protection. Often, these wraps match the team colours. The pony's mane is most often roached (hogged), and its tail is docked or braided {{so that it will}} not snag the rider's mallet.|$|E

5000|$|A stenomask is a {{hand-held}} microphone {{built into a}} padded, sound-proof enclosure that fits over the speaker's mouth or nose and mouth. Some lightweight versions may be fitted with <b>an</b> elastic <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> to hold them in place while freeing the user's hands for other tasks. The purpose of a stenomask is to allow a person to speak without being heard by other people, and to keep background noise away from the microphone.|$|R
2500|$|In a few {{models of}} scuba {{regulator}} the mouthpiece {{also has an}} outer rubber flange that fits outside the lips and extends into two straps that fasten together behind the neck. This helps to keep the mouthpiece in place if the user's jaws go slack through unconsciousness or distraction. The mouthpiece safety flange {{may also be a}} separate component. The attached neck strap also allows the diver to keep the regulator hanging under the chin where it is protected and ready for use. Recent mouthpieces do not usually include an external flange, but the practice of using <b>a</b> <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> has been revived by technical divers who use a bungee or surgical rubber [...] "necklace" [...] which can come off the mouthpiece without damage if pulled firmly.|$|E

5000|$|In 1947, Kloehn {{reported}} {{on the use of}} occipital Headgear which was attached by hooks to a maxillary [...]045 in archwire against the first molars. To prevent the side-effect of molar tipping, he modified the appliance by taking the bow and soldering it to the inner arch of the incisor area and therefore eliminated the [...] "Victorian" [...] headcap stigma associated with headgear. Therefore, the headgear was modified with <b>a</b> cervical <b>neck</b> <b>strap.</b>|$|R
2500|$|There {{are four}} {{fundamental}} types of bare-midriff bikini tops: the brassi√®re, halter, bandeau, and vest. These styles are differentiated {{by the number}} of shoulder straps and the resultant number of edges to the garment. [...] Some of these tops include <b>a</b> halter-style <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> that offers more coverage and support, a strapless bandeau, a rectangular strip of fabric covering the breasts that minimizes large breasts, a top with cups similar to a push-up bra, and the more traditional triangle cups that lift and shape the breasts.|$|R
25|$|His {{expertise}} in color photography subsequently {{brought him to}} National Geographic magazine, where he was officially hired on July 23, 1934. The magazine prided itself on publishing quality color photography, and Marden was making good use of a lightweight Leica, which could hang from <b>a</b> single <b>neck</b> <b>strap.</b> Marden persuaded the magazine to see the benefits of using the small 35mm cameras loaded with the new Kodachrome film over the bulky cameras with tripods and glass plates that were {{being used by the}} magazine's photographers at the time.|$|R

5000|$|The {{standing}} martingale, {{also known}} as a [...] "tiedown" [...] or a [...] "head check," [...] has a single strap which is attached to the girth, passes between the horse's front legs and is fixed {{to the back of the}} noseband. To prevent it from catching on other objects, it also has <b>a</b> <b>neck</b> <b>strap.</b> A variation is attached to a breastplate in lieu of <b>a</b> <b>neck</b> <b>strap.</b> When correctly fitted for English riding, it should be possible to push the martingale strap up to touch the horse's throatlatch.|$|E
50|$|TLRs {{are also}} ideal for candid camera shots where an {{eye-level}} camera would be conspicuous. A TLR can be hung on <b>a</b> <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> and the shutter fired by cable release.|$|E
50|$|Klezmer {{instrument}} {{choices were}} traditionally based, by necessity, on an instrument's portability. Music being required for several {{parts of the}} wedding ceremony, taking place in different rooms or courtyards, the band had to relocate quickly from space to space. Further, klezmorim were usually itinerant musicians, who moved {{from town to town}} for work. Therefore, instruments held in the hands (clarinet, violin, trumpet, flute) or supported by <b>a</b> <b>neck</b> or shoulder <b>strap</b> (accordion, cimbalom, drum) were favored over those that rested on the ground (cello, bass violin), or needed several people to move (piano).|$|R
5000|$|The {{traditional}} attire of a stockman or grazier is a felt Akubra hat; {{a double}} flapped, two pocket (for stock notebooks) cotton shirt; a plaited kangaroo skin belt carrying a stockman's pocket knife in a pouch; light coloured, stockman cut, moleskin trousers with brown elastic side boots. The moleskin trousers have now largely {{been replaced by}} jeans. The plaited belt is often replaced by a working stockman or ringer with a belt known as a Queensland Utility Strap {{which can be used}} as <b>a</b> belt, <b>neck</b> <b>strap,</b> lunch-time hobble or a tie for a [...] "micky". This attire is still used in Australian Stock Horse competitions. Pocket knives may be used to castrate and/or earmark an animal, to bang cattle tails or in an emergency to cut free an animal entangled in a rope or horse tack. Specially designed and cut for riding, oilskin coats are used during wet weather. The horse typically wears a ringhead bridle, a saddle cloth, a leather Australian stock saddle, which may be equipped with a breastplate in steep country, and saddlebag and quart-pot.|$|R
50|$|<b>Neck</b> <b>strap.</b> <b>A</b> simple narrow {{leather strap}} buckled around <b>a</b> horse's <b>neck</b> to give {{security}} to jockeys and other riders. Up until several years it was only used by beginner riders, but has now become popular with jockeys who ride with a very short stirrup leather. Another form of <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> (or rope) is the one used by cowboys when roping. This style is shorter and placed closer to the horse's head with the lariat passing through it, {{in order to keep}} the horse facing the calf after it has been roped. It also refers to the part of a martingale, which buckles around the horse's <b>neck.</b> <b>A</b> loose <b>neck</b> collar is also used on harness racing horses when the reins are passed through it.|$|R

5000|$|Similar {{in style}} and length as a full fitting shell top, but differing in {{the upper part of}} the garment. This top is {{normally}} fully sleeveless, and more revealing of the upper back. The halter style normally includes <b>a</b> <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> on the top that ties in the back.|$|E
50|$|The running {{martingale}} {{consists of}} a strap which {{is attached to the}} girth and passes between the horse's front legs before dividing into two pieces. At the end of each of these straps is a small metal ring through which the reins pass. It is held in the correct position by <b>a</b> <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> or breastplate.|$|E
50|$|Being {{the classic}} {{breastplate}} for English riding, campdrafting or stockwork, the stockman's or hunting breastplate {{is the most}} common type. It consists of a yoke (with <b>a</b> <b>neck</b> and wither <b>strap),</b> <b>a</b> breast strap {{at the bottom of the}} yoke which runs through the horse's front legs and attaches to the girth, and two straps at the top of the yoke which attach to the D-rings of a saddle. There are usually buckles for adjusting the size of the yoke as well as the length of the straps which attach to the saddle and girth. The hunting breastplate not only helps to prevent the saddle from slipping, but also may be used to attach a Market Harborough or standing and running martingales, which are clipped or buckled onto a ring at the chest.|$|R

5000|$|The Bethesda autopsy {{physicians}} {{attempted to}} probe the bullet hole {{in the base of}} Kennedy's neck above the scapula, but were unsuccessful as it passed through <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> muscle. They did not perform a full dissection or persist in tracking, as throughout the autopsy, they were unaware of the exit wound, {{at the front of the}} throat. Emergency room physicians had obscured it when they performed the tracheotomy.|$|R
50|$|An apron {{is usually}} {{held in place}} by two ribbon-like strips of cloth that are tied at the back. A bib apron may either have a strap around the neck (perhaps the most {{widespread}} use today), or shoulder straps that criss-cross at the back and attach to the waistband. The advantage of the former design is that it makes it especially simple to put on the bib apron. The advantage of the shoulder strap design is that it makes the apron more comfortable to wear; <b>a</b> <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> can slightly impair ease of movement.|$|E
5000|$|Bags {{attached}} to belts {{have been in}} use since antiquity in many cultures. One origin was the Native American buffalo pouch which was used instead of sewing pockets into clothing. Buffalo pouches may also be worn on the wrist or carried {{on the front of}} the chest via <b>a</b> <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> or lanyard. [...] The¬†European medieval belt-pouch is another antecedent which was superseded as clothing came to have pockets. The Scottish sporran is a similar belted pouch that survived because of the impracticality of pockets in a kilt.|$|E
50|$|Pigs, {{cattle and}} sheep are {{frequently}} earmarked with pliers that notch registered owner and/or age marks into the ear. Mares on large horse breeding farms have a plastic tag attached to <b>a</b> <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> for identification; which preserves their ears free of notches. Dairy cows are sometimes identified with ratchet fastened plastic anklets fitted on the pastern for ready inspection during milking; however NLIS requirements apply to cattle - including both dairy and beef animals. More commonly coloured electrical tape {{is used as}} short term ankle identifiers for dairy animals to identify when one teat should not be milked for any reason. Laboratory rodents are often marked with ear tags, ear notches or implantable microchips.|$|E
50|$|A backless dress {{can be held}} up in {{a number}} of ways. The most common is by a single piece of cloth or strap which passes behind the wearer's neck, halterneck-style. The <b>neck</b> <b>strap</b> can itself be covered by the wearer's hair, leaving the {{impression}} from behind that nothing is holding the dress up. Alternatively, the dress may be held up by short sleeves or by a single or two spaghetti straps, which hold the dress up at the shoulders. A stick-on dress or nude netting are other ways that a dress can be held up.|$|R
