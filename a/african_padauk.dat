50|$|Pterocarpus soyauxii, the <b>African</b> <b>padauk</b> or African coralwood, is {{a species}} of Pterocarpus in the family Fabaceae, native to central and {{tropical}} west Africa, from Nigeria east to Congo-Kinshasa and south to Angola.|$|E
50|$|Ichabod is a one-of-a-kind synthesizer. The {{case was}} hand made from <b>African</b> <b>Padauk,</b> {{measuring}} six feet across and four feet high, {{with the capacity}} to contain 192 modules. It was delivered to Corgan in September 2009.|$|E
50|$|The padauk {{found most}} often is <b>African</b> <b>Padauk</b> from Pterocarpus soyauxii which, when freshly cut, {{is a very}} bright red/orange but when exposed to {{sunlight}} fades over time to a warm brown. Its colour makes it a favourite among woodworkers. Burmese Padauk (ပိတောက်) is Pterocarpus macrocarpus while Andaman Padauk is Pterocarpus dalbergioides. Padauks can be confused with rosewoods {{to which they are}} somewhat related, but as a general rule padauks are coarser and less decorative in figure. Like rosewood, padauk is sometimes used to make xylophone and marimba keys, and guitars. It is an important material in traditional Chinese furniture.|$|E
50|$|Two {{theories}} {{exist for}} that obvious change in production: quick-grown wood (therefore not giving {{the time for}} the wood to age naturally and achieve the full density that padauk would naturally acquire over time) or a change in the wood species (<b>African</b> <b>padauk</b> for the first models, Indian padauk for the later ones). Another reason for the difference in color is the oxidation of the reddish pigments in padouk wood by UV light over time. All padauk darkens with age from a red/orange to a deep purplish brown, and the time between runs likely contributes to the differentiation in color.|$|E
50|$|Planning {{for wood}} {{finishing}} also involves {{thinking about the}} properties of the wood {{that you are going to}} finish, as these can greatly affect the appearance and performance of finishes, and also the type of finishing system that will give the wood the characteristics you are seeking. For example, woods that show great variation in colour between sapwood and heartwood or within heartwood may require a preliminary staining step to reduce colour variation. Alternatively, the wood can be bleached to remove the natural colour of the wood and then stained to the desired colour. Woods that are coarse textured such oaks and other ring-porous hardwoods may need to be filled before they are finished to ensure the coating can bridge the pores and resist cracking. The pores in ring-porous woods preferentially absorb pigmented stain, and advantage can be taken of this to highlight the wood's grain. Some tropical woods, such as rosewood (Dalbergia nigra), cocobolo (Dalbergia retusa) and <b>African</b> <b>padauk</b> (Pterocarpus soyauxii), contain extractives such as quinones, which retard the curing of unsaturated polyester and UV-cured acrylate coatings, and so other finishing systems should be used with these species.|$|E
40|$|Vibrational {{properties}} (specific dynamic Young's modulus E'/r and {{damping coefficient}} tand) of wood are of special importance for several parts of musical instruments. But, concerning tand, {{little is known}} about the inter-specific variability. This last parameter can be partly explained by microfibril angles (as for E'/r), and in some cases by an additional effect of some extractives. The effect of some extractives has also been observed on dimensional stability, this factor being also relevant for musical instruments making. We studied the effect of extractives on tand, and on moisture related properties, of <b>African</b> <b>Padauk,</b> taking into account different radial locations in the trunk, from sapwood to inner heartwood. Removal of extractives provoked a marked increase in both damping and shrinkage of heartwood. Further experiments are conducted in order to find a first typology of the effects of extractives on lowering/rising the damping and/or the shrinkage...|$|E

This study aimed at clarifying their respective impact on vibrational properties, referring to <b>African</b> <b>Padauk</b> (Pterocarpus soyauxii Taub.), a species selected for its interlocked grain, high extractives content and uses in xylophones. Specimens were cut {{parallel to the}} trunk axis (L), and local variations in grain angle (GA), microfibril angle (MFA), specific Young's modulus (E 0 L/q, where q stands for the density) and damping coefficient (tandL) were measured. GA dependence was analysed by a mechanical model which allowed to identify the specific Young's modulus (E 03 /q) and shear modulus (G 0 /q) along the grain (3) {{as well as their}} corresponding damping coefficients (tand 3, tandG). This analysis was done for native and then for extracted wood. Interlocked grain resulted in 0 - 25 _ GA and in variations of a factor 2 in E 0 L/q and tandL. Along the grain, Padauk wood was characterized, when compared to typical hardwoods, by a somewhat lower E 03 /q and elastic anisotropy (E 0 /G 0), due to a wide microfibril angle plus a small weight effect.

This paper investigates such effects for <b>African</b> <b>Padauk</b> (Pterocarpus soyauxii Taub.), a tropical hardwood with high extractives content and a preferred material for xylophones. 5 groups of 26 heartwood specimens with large, yet comparable, ranges in vibrational properties were extracted in different solvents.

Methanol (ME) reached most of compounds (13 %), located about half in lumen and half in cell-wall. Water solubility was extremely low. tanδ and E'/ρ were very strongly related (R 2 ≥ 0. 93), but native wood had abnormally low values of tanδ, while extraction shifted this relation towards higher tanδ values.

3000|$|Sources of {{variations}} in dynamic mechanical properties of wood include cell arrangement and grain angle, microfibril angle within the cell wall, proportions of constitutive polymers, {{as well as}} the presence of additional compounds [5 – 9]. Although in lower quantities than cell wall constitutive polymers, extractives can have a considerable effect on mechanical and damping properties of wood. Exceptionally low damping of some musically important woods was somehow correlated with their extractives. Extractives impact can be studied either through correlations between their amounts and vibrational properties variation resulting by their removal, or by the re-injection of extracts into a “neutral” wood. Methanol extraction increased the tanδ of heartwood by 15 – 37 % in red cedar (Thuja plicata) and up to 60 % in <b>African</b> <b>Padauk</b> (Pterocarpus soyauxii), while E′/γ slightly decreased [10, 11]. Impregnation of water-soluble extractives of pernambuco (Caesalpinia echinata) into spruce decreased tanδ by a half [12]. The formation of hydrogen bonds between extractives and cell wall matrix was proposed as a possible cause of tanδ reduction [13]. Impregnation of Sitka spruce with isolated key chemical compounds from muirapiranga (Brosimum rubescens), a Moraceae as is mulberry, decreased tanδ by up to 25 %, both in axial and radial directions. This was explained by motion restriction of matrix macromolecules due to extractives entering [14]. Contrary to these studies, water-soluble extractives of Reed (Arundo donax L.) increased both tanδ and E′ [15, 16]. Extractives can also change wood equilibrium moisture content (EMC) [17]. Higher EMC induces higher tanδ and lower [...] E′/γ [18, 19]. The potential effect of extractives on vibrational properties could come from their chemical structure, cellular location and relation with basic polymers [11, 13]. Removing extractives using solvents of different polarities could give a first idea about their polarity and possible cellular location.|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} {{thesis is}} focused on aesthetical and acoustic properties of tropical wood. The discussed tropical species are utilized in Europe mainly for their unusual appearance and colour in joinery and furniture production. The irreplacable acoustic properties like low internal friction predestine specific species for production of musical instruments. The colour of six selected tropical species - jatoba (Hymenea courbaril L.), massaranduba (Manilkara bidentata A. Chev.), muiracatiara (Astronium graveolens Jacq.), angelim amargoso (Vatairea spp.), angelim pedra (Hymenolobium spp.) and angelim vermelho (Dinizia excelsa Ducke) - were analyzed and expressed in CIEL*a*b* colour space. Subsequently the samples were exposed to artificial sunlight and the light-induced discolouration rate and progress was evaluated. The colour change was rapid in zhe first hours of exposure and all species showed a similar trend in lightness (L*) change - initial darkening replaced by gradual fading. The change in chromatic parameters (a* and b*) change was specific for individual species and probably related to the chemical composition of the extractives. The overall discolouration of lighter coloured wood samples is more distinctive. The extractive content of tropical species is usually high and determines wood colour. The wood of <b>African</b> <b>Padauk</b> (Pterocarpus soyauxii Taub) and Jatoba (Hymenaea courbaril L.) was extracted {{in a mixture of}} methanol, water and acetone. The total extractives and total phenolic content was measured. Extractive content was related to colour parameters and above all to lightness in both species. The increase in extractive content leads to a lighter and more yellow colouration of Jatoba wood while <b>African</b> <b>Padauk</b> was darker with a higher amount of extractives. In Jatoba, a positive correlation was found between extractive content and the rate of discolouration. The extractives are responsible for intensive discolouration of tropical woods in contrast to light coloured woods from the temperate zone, where the yellowing is primarily caused by lignin photodegradation. The sound velocity was measured by ultrasound and resonance longitudinal method in heartwood of doussie (Afzelia bipindensis), merbau (Intsia bijuga), wengé (Millettia stuhlmannii Taub.), muiracatiara (Astronium graveolens Jacq.) and zebrano (Microberlinia brazzavillensis). The sound velocity was not related to the density in any case. Although anatomical structural characteristics as fiber length or ray ratio positively influenced it. With longer fibers and slender rays the sound velocity increased. Other acoustic properties like dynamic young modulus of elasticity, specific modulus of elasticity, internal friction and acoustic conversion efficiency (ACE) were determined and were related to measured anatomical features. The differences in composition of wood tissue of individual species were the main source of departure between the assessed relationships. The wood with longer fibers and lower frequency of rays reached lower values of internal friction. The stiffness of wood characterized by the dynamic modulus of elasticity was correlated with fiber and ray tissue. A higher volume of fibers influenced the stiffness positively, while ray volume had the opposite effect on stiffness. Positive effects of fiber length and ray ratio were found for dynamic modulus of elasticity and for acoustic conversion efficiency as well. Both values increased with longer fibers and higher ray ratio. The sound velocity is the basis of some nondestructive techniques for determination of wood mechanical properties. The comparison of density and three dynamic moduli of elasticity (longitudinal and flexural resonance method and ultrasound method) in prediction of mechanical properties was carried out. The density was evaluated as a poor predictor when the samples are not straight-grained and defect free. The interlocked grain often occurred in tropical species and its presence influences the mechanical properties of wood but not wood density. The dynamic moduli of elasticity showed strong correlation with the static modulus of elasticity. Among nondestructive techniques, the weakest correlation was found for the ultrasound method, which is probably partially explained by different measuring mechanism. The prediction of the modulus of rupture is less accurate when the dynamic modulus of elasticity is compared with the static modulus of elasticity; however, it was still good in comparison with the density model...|$|E
