500|$|Hughes won the grudge {{match against}} Serra at UFC 98: Evans vs. Machida via {{unanimous}} decision. In the first round, both fighters collided heads, and Hughes got {{the worst of}} it. Despite this, Serra could not finish the fight and Hughes recovered rapidly. In the second stanza, Hughes controlled his opponent {{on the ground with}} his wrestling skills. The final round saw the former champions taking each other down and exchanging punches. The back and forth action rewarded both competitors with Fight of the Night honors. After the fight Hughes and Serra embraced each other and ended their feud. Hughes posted on his blog: [...] "When the fight was over, I was pretty confident I was going to get my hand raised. Some people have asked why I raised his hand at the end. Actually I didn't, he raised mine. He <b>also</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that, no matter what the decision was, he was done with the rivalry". After the fight Hughes said, [...] "I think I have a few more fights left in me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Mi Chico Latino" [...] {{was directed by}} Doug Nichol and filmed in Sardinia from 5-8 July 1999. Halliwell wanted the video for the song to be very different in style to her previous single [...] "Look At Me", as that one was filmed in Prague in the freezing cold, and she wanted something to connect with her fans. According to her, the video was also pretty easy to get: [...] "a yacht, {{a girl in a}} bikini and some sexy boy dancers to keep both sets of fans [...] happy". After the video was released, the singer got a huge amount of attention from it. [...] "People {{came up to me and}} told me how great and how sexy it was. They <b>also</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I looked really healthy, but how wrong they were. I wasn't healthy because I wasn't eating properly and although I was slim at the time, that was a mirage too because the tough regime of the diet was always going to lead me to binge and put the weight back on", and later, she began taking recovery meetings for bulimia.|$|E

So, later when I had married her sister (Eva), we worked with her other sister and Bob Summers (her brother) on guitar (sounds like Les Paul too) and Mary's other sister Carol.

60|$|The {{only reason}} I {{did not go}} was that I felt too tired. The very thought {{of the effort to}} swim over was nauseating.

Otoo, he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> his name was (pronounced o-to-o); <b>also,</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that he was a native of Bora Bora, the most westerly of the Society Group.

6000|$|But {{the times}} changed. There came {{a day when}} I heard, in my native town, a Republican mayor {{publicly}} proclaim that [...] "municipal ownership was a fixed American policy." [...] And in that day I found myself picking up in the world. No longer did the pathologist study me, while the really decent fellows did not mind in the least the propinquity of myself and their sisters in the public eye. My political and sociological ideas were ascribed {{to the vagaries of}} youth, and good-natured elderly men patronized <b>me</b> and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that I would grow up some day and become an unusually intelligent member of the community. <b>Also</b> they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that my views were biassed by my empty pockets, and that some day, when I had gathered to me a few dollars, my views would be wholly different,--in short, that my views would be their views.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{month after}} the last act of the Sorais tragedy that a great {{ceremony}} was held in the Flower Temple, and Curtis was formally declared King-Consort of Zu-Vendis. I was too ill to go myself; and indeed, I hate all that sort of thing, with the crowds and the trumpet-blowing and banner-waving; but Good, who was there (in his full-dress uniform), came back much impressed, and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that Nyleptha had looked lovely, and Curtis had borne himself in a right royal fashion, and had been received with acclamations that left no doubt as to his popularity. <b>Also</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that when the horse Daylight was led along in the procession, the populace had shouted 'Macumazahn, Macumazahn!' till they were hoarse, and would only be appeased when he, Good, rose in his chariot and told them that I was too ill to be present.|$|R

"The Mazitu {{said that}} the Pongo people are devils who came by the secret {{channels}} through the reeds in canoes and stole their children and women, whom they sacrificed to their gods.

The Mazitu want to attack them but cannot do so, because they are not water people and have no canoes, and therefore are unable to reach the island, if it is an island. <b>Also</b> they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about the wonderful flower which grows in the place where the ape-god lives, and is worshipped like the god.

60|$|He <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> {{he could}} not tell exactly to what degree the {{plantation}} was improved; but this he knew, that my partner was growing exceeding rich upon the enjoying but one half of it; and that, {{to the best of}} his remembrance, he had heard, that the king's third of my part, which was, it seems, granted away to some other monastery, or religious house, amounted to above two hundred moidores a year; that, as to my being restored to a quiet possession of it, there was no question to be made of that, my partner being alive to witness my title, and my name being also enrolled in the register of the county. <b>Also</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> that the survivors of my two trustees were very fair, honest people, and very wealthy, and he believed I would not only have their assistance for putting me in possession, but would find a very considerable sum of money in their hands for my account, being the produce of the farm, while their fathers held the trust, and before it was given up, as above, which, as he remembered, was about twelve years.|$|R
60|$|I saw {{a strange}} thing happen, while the firing was going on, which may amuse those who take an {{interest}} in the habits and development of animals. Just in front of my tent, which was open, was a clear space, occupied by a flock of goats and sheep. The brilliant moonlight made everything plainly visible. Every time a bullet whistled over them or struck the ground near, they ducked and bobbed in evident terror. An officer, who <b>also</b> noticed this, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{it was the first time}} they had been under fire; and I have been wondering ever since, whether this explains their fear, or makes it more inexplicable.|$|R

5000|$|In 1988 Les {{decided not}} to re-licence {{the rights to the}} Triumph and began to design his own version of a motorcycle, the Matchless G80. Fitted with a Rotax 494 cc {{air-cooled}} engine, there was also a Harris Matchless G80 built with a twin front disc brake and an electric starter. These were produced until the recession of 1990 when the business returned to the producing much sought after spare parts for classic motorcycles. Les also built 8 Matchless G80 for trial with the White Helmets Display Team.

They were driven ashore near the rapids at Portage la Prairie by Cuthbert Grant and around 50 armed Canadians and Métis. Pambrun and his goods were captured {{and sent to}} Qu’Appelle. The NWC later testified that they found the furs in some abandoned boats. While a prisoner at Qu’Appelle, Pierre Pambrun observed the Nor’Wester’s preparations for their attack on the Red River Colony. He wrote: “I remained a prisoner at Qu’Appelle...I saw a blacksmith, {{by the name of}} Gardepie...making lances, and daggers; also repairing guns and pistols for the different half-breeds then going upon the expedition for the destruction of the colony...During their stay at Qu’Appelle, their whole amusement was in shooting at the mark, singing war songs, practicing with their lances and telling each other how they would kill the English - meaning the settlers - and they <b>also</b> often <b>told</b> <b>me</b> they were going to kill them like rabbits.” ...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{grew from}} a talk I gave on the {{occasion}} of the seventieth anniversary of the Chinese Mathematical Society. I dedicate the lecture to the memory of my teacher S. S. Chern who had passed away half a year before (December 2004). During my graduate studies, I was rather free in picking research topics. I [724] worked on fundamental groups of manifolds with non-positive curvature. But in the second year of my studies, I started to look into differential equations on manifolds. However, at that time, Chern was very much interested in the work of Bott on holomorphic vector fields. <b>Also</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that I should work on Riemann hypothesis. (Weil had told him that it was time for the hypothesis to be settled.) While Chern did not express his opinions about my research on geometric analysis, he started to appreciate it a few years later. In fact, after Chern gave a course on Calabi’s works on affine geometry in 1972 at Berkeley, S. Y. Cheng <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about these inspiring lectures. By 1973, Cheng and I started to work on some problems mentioned in Chern’s lectures. We did not realize that the great geometers Pogorelov, Calabi and Nirenberg were also working on them. We were excited that we solved some of the conjectures of Calabi on improper affine spheres. But soon after we found out that Pogorelov [556] published his results right before us by different arguments. Nevertheless ou...|$|R

These would follow before long, and with them their proper ammunition, with a shipload of the same to follow shortly after.|$|E

6000|$|For {{the rest}} when Kari saw my workmen {{fashioning}} gold and setting jewels {{in it for}} sale to the nobles and ladies of the Court, he was much interested {{and asked if he}} might be allowed to follow this craft, of which he said he understood something, and thus earn the bread he ate. I answered, yes, for I knew that it irked his proud nature to be dependent on me, and gave him gold and silver with a little room having a furnace in it where he could labour. The first thing he made was an object about two inches across, round and with a groove at the back of it, on the front of which he fashioned an image of the sun having a human face and rays of light projecting all about. I asked him what was its purpose, whereon he took the piece and thrust it into the lobe of his ear where the gristle had been stretched in the fashion that I have described, which it fitted exactly. Then he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that in his country all the nobles wore such ornaments and that those who did so were called [...] "ear-men" [...] to distinguish them from the common people. <b>Also</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> many other things too long to set out, which made me desire more than ever to see this empire with my eyes, for an empire and no less he declared it to be.|$|R

I tried to go up to speak to them, but a young Boer, seeing me, shot at me with his gun, so I thought it safer to lie hid. At nightfall, however, I met the driver of one of the waggons, a Kaffir man, at some distance from the laager, where he was watching by a pit made to catch bucks, and fell into talk with him. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that this was a party of the Boers who had trekked from Cape Colony, and were taking possession of Natal, and that there were other such parties scattered about the country. He said that in this party there were five-and-twenty men with women and children, but he did not know the names of any of them. <b>Also</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that he meant to run away, as he heard that Dingaan was going to attack the white people, and was sure that if he did so they would be eaten up, for these Boers, thinking themselves quite safe, had grown very careless, and neither made their laager as strong as it should be nor set any watch at night.
