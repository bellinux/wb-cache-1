40|$|The {{adhesion}} {{between two}} adjacent layers in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) {{is critically important}} to ensure the desired performance. However, measuring the interface adhesion is very difficult because most layers in an SOFC are brittle and/or porous. This paper introduces a simple technique for the quantitative measurement of interface adhesion of SOFCs. A hard, spherically tipped indenter is driven through the top layer(s) and into the underlying substrate of a plate SOFC specimen. Extensive plastic deformation of the substrate causes an interface <b>annular</b> <b>crack.</b> The interface adhesion is then calculated from the radius of the <b>annular</b> <b>crack.</b> The indentation method should be suitable for the adhesion measurement of any SOFC with a porous support. A measurement procedure and the related calculation equations for determining the interface adhesion are presented in this paper. The interface adhesion of a cermet-supported SOFC with a doped ceria electrolyte for operation at 4002 ̆ 013600 0 C was measured to demonstrate {{the use of the}} indentation method. The measurement indicated that the cermet-supported SOFC had sufficient interface adhesion. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|The {{deformation}} {{behavior of}} diamondlike carbon (DLC) coatings on silicon substrates induced by Berkovich indentation has been investigated. DLC coatings deposited by a plasma-assisted {{chemical vapor deposition}} technique were subjected to nanoindentation with a Berkovich indenter over a range of maximum loads from 100 to 300 mN. Distinct pop-ins were observed for loads greater than 150 mN. However, no pop-out was observed for the loads studied. The top surface of the indents showed <b>annular</b> <b>cracks</b> with associated fragmented material. The cross sections showed up to 20 % localized reduction in thickness of the DLC coating beneath the indenter tip. Cracking, { 111 } slip, stacking faults, and localized phase transformations were observed in the silicon substrate. The discontinuities in the load-displacement curves at low loads are attributed to plastic deformation of the silicon substrate, whereas at higher loads they are attributed to plastic deformation as well as phase transformation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the {{mechanical}} behavior of the joint between concrete filled steel tubular column and beam with discontinuous column tube at the joint zone under axial pressure, the finite element analysis software ANSYS is adopted for parametric analysis and the analysis results are compared with experimental ones. The principal compressive stress is mainly transmitted by the inside area of the joint which is subjected to local compression if it is low, but extends to more outside areas of the joint if it is high. The radial compressive stress, which is the confined stress of the ring beam to the core concrete of the joint, keeps {{the same as that}} the width of the ring beam equal to the diameter of the core area of the joint. The vertical strain {{on the edge of the}} joint, which would lead to horizontal <b>annular</b> <b>cracks</b> in the side face of the ring beam, changes from tension in the whole height to tension only in the top part and compression in the lower part of the joint, which is consistent with the experimental phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Indentation-induced {{delamination}} of {{thin films}} provides {{the basis for}} adhesion calculations. In the case of ductile Cu films plastic deformation usually prevents a film from debonding from the substrate. Deadhesion is facilitated {{by the use of}} a hard W superlayer, which promotes indenter-induced Cu film failure, increasing the delamination area by an order of magnitude. Radial as well as <b>annular</b> <b>cracking</b> acts like a secondary mechanism in the strain energy release, and can be resolved from excursions on the load-displacement curves. For the thicker Cu films no excursions were observed, though radial cracking took place. It is important to identify fracture events as they occur {{in order to understand the}} system behavior and accurately apply the analysis. An acoustic emission signal is used to detect both the magnitude and the type of fracture events in thin Cu films. For the films of different thickness from 40 nm to 3 microns the corresponding interfacial fracture energy ranged from 0. 2 to over 100 J/m 2. Limits of plastic energy dissipation are determined with the lower limit, the true work of adhesion, being associated with a dislocation emission criterion. Crack arrest marks were found upon the blister removal, and are proposed to represent the shape of the crack tip. Total acoustic emission energy was found to be inversely proportional to the strain energy release rate...|$|R

Stress intensity factors at the crack tips and the stresses at the interface are studied to de-termine the nature of the crack growth in the composite. These parameters are studied as a function of the elastic moduli and the thermal expansion coefficients of the constituents, the fiber volume ratio, crack geometry, and interface properties.

40|$|Formation of {{cracks in}} a {{material}} {{as a result}} of the damage accumulation may change (weaken) material effective properties. The present letter suggests an approach to estimate such changes when cracks form at interfaces of dissimilar materials (for example, at matrix/inclusion boundaries or film/substrate interfaces). Generally, solution of an interface problem is required to predict compliances of interfacial cracks, with the exception of planar cracks. We show that planar cracks possess a special property in the sense that their normal compliances may be approximated from solutions in a homogeneous medium. The method is then applied to analyze elastic compliances of the rectilinear, penny-shaped, elliptical, and <b>annular</b> interfacial <b>cracks.</b> (C) 2005 American Institute of Physics. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Multilayers of {{tungsten}} carbide/carbon (WC/C) deposited by {{physical vapor deposition}} onto steel substrates were subjected to depth-sensing indentation testing. The investigation aimed at probing the influence of dissimilarities between the microstructure of the multilayers and substrate on the system mechanical properties. The resultant load-displacement data were analyzed both by conventional load-displacement (P-δ) and load-displacement squared (P-δ^ 2) plots. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the occurrence of <b>annular</b> through-thickness <b>cracks</b> around the indentation sites can be identified from the load-displacement curve. Also, analysis of {{the lower part of}} the unloading curve permitted us to identify whether the coating had popped up by localized fracture. The cracking mechanism was characterized using a new technique for cross-sectional electron microscopy of the nanoindentations. The information retrieved with this technique eliminates the problems, inherent in assessing at this small contact scales, whether the fracture is by coating decohesion or by interfacial failure. In our case, it was demonstrated that the failure mechanism was decohesion of the carbon lamellae within the multilayers. The mechanical properties (hardness and effective Young’s modulus) were also assessed by nanoindentation. The hysteresis loops were analyzed and discussed in terms of a method developed previously. ...|$|R

40|$|Metallic {{sandwich}} panels with prismatic cores {{offer the}} potential for superior blast resistance relative to monolithic plates of equivalent areal density. However, under sufficiently high impulse, severe plastic strains can occur at the junctions of the face sheets and the core members shortly after arrival of the pres-sure wave but prior to significant deformation elsewhere. The potential consequence is localized shear rupture with minimal plastic dissipation. To characterize this failure mode, a combined experimental-numerical protocol {{has been used to}} ascertain the plastic strain for dynamic shear rupture of ductile metals. The experimental component involves firing cylindrical projectiles through plates of the targeted materials and monitoring changes in projectile velocity during penetration. With appropriate combina-tions of plate thickness and projectile velocity, penetration occurs through propagation of an <b>annular</b> shear <b>crack.</b> In parallel, a numerical model of dynamic deformation and rupture has been employed to infer the critical strain through comparisons with projectile velocity change measurements. Experiments and analyses have been performed on both 304 stainless steel and superaustenitic AL 6 XN. Effects of mesh size on the resolution of the predicted strain distribution and the plastic dissipation associated with penetration are addressed. 1...|$|R

The population pore-size distribution {{and the distribution of}} the pore size at the fracture origin were correllated by extreme-value statistics. Fracture strength distribution was then predicted from the extreme-value pore-size distribution, usin a linear elastic fracture mechanics model of <b>annular</b> <b>crack</b> around pore and the fracture toughness of the ceramic.

40|$|We {{report an}} {{experimental}} study of the crack pattern formed during the drying of a colloidal suspension. A horizontal fiber, which provides a one dimensional, boundary-free substrate, is coated by a film of micronic thickness. The geometry imposes a remarkable <b>annular</b> <b>crack</b> pattern and allowing precise measurements of the crack spacing over a short range of film thickness (between 2 and 10 μm) which varies linearly with the film height. We compare our experimental data with a model proposed by Kitsunezaki {{which suggests that the}} variation of the crack spacing with the film thickness depends on the ratio between a critical stress at cracking and a critical stress for slipping on the substrate. By measuring the friction force of the colloidal gels on a hydrophobic surface through a cantilever technique, we can deduce the critical crack stress for these colloidal gels simply by measuring the crack spacing of the pattern.

40|$|International audienceThe {{growth of}} 3 D star-like cracks in a porous {{borosilicate}} glass was induced by "cold-to-hot" thermal shocks inducing triaxial tension in cylindrical specimens. As {{a consequence of}} the dynamic character of their propagation, the cracks had a "mirror- mist- hackle" aspect. Damage in unbroken specimens was characterized either by a modification of their vibration modes or by direct observations of sections. Pores were identified as the crack initiation sites. Thermo-mechanical simulations were done to analyze the stress field and its consequences, using either linear thermo-elasticity or an anisotropic continuum damage mechanics approach. Crack initiation was predicted at mid-height, {{at the center of the}} specimens, in accordance with the observations. The pore-induced stress concentration was shown to depend on the local stress triaxiality, as well as the stress intensity factor for an <b>annular</b> <b>crack</b> initiated from a pore.

40|$|A semi-numerical {{method is}} {{reviewed}} for solving {{a set of}} coupled partial differential equations subject to mixed and possibly coupled boundary conditions. The line method of analysis {{is applied to the}} Navier-Cauchy equations of elastic and elastoplastic equilibrium to calculate the displacement distributions in various, simple geometry bodies containing cracks. The application of this method to the appropriate field equations leads to coupled sets of simultaneous ordinary differential equations whose solutions are obtained along sets of lines in a discretized region. When decoupling of the equations and their boundary conditions is not possible, the use of a successive approximation procedure permits the analytical solution of the resulting ordinary differential equations. The use of this method is illustrated by reviewing and presenting selected solutions of mixed boundary value problems in three dimensional fracture mechanics. These solutions are of great importance in fracture toughness testing, where accurate stress and displacement distributions are required for the calculation of certain fracture parameters. Computations obtained for typical flawed specimens include that for elastic as well as elastoplastic response. Problems in both Cartesian and cylindrical coordinate systems are included. Results are summarized for a finite geometry rectangular bar with a central through-the-thickness or rectangular surface crack under remote uniaxial tension. In addition, stress and displacement distributions are reviewed for finite circular bars with embedded penny-shaped cracks, and rods with external <b>annular</b> or ring <b>cracks</b> under opening mode tension. The results obtained show that the method of lines presents a systematic approach to the solution of some three-dimensional mechanics problems with arbitrary boundary conditions. The advantage of this method over other numerical solutions is that good results are obtained even from the use of a relatively coarse grid...|$|R
40|$|In general, the {{propagation}} of transverse cracks in horizontal shafts of rotating machines causes {{major changes in the}} synchronous vibrations and minor but significant changes in the supersynchronous vibrations. Often, abnormal changes of the twice per revolution harmonic component of the machine vibration is considered the most important symptom of a crack propagation. However, in rotating machines subjected to considerable thermal transients, like steam and gas turbines, it is not unusual that multiple crack initiations occur at the root {{of a large number of}} blades of a single wheel. This type of failure may generate annular transverse cracks. This paper shows the results of a parametric analysis performed to study the effects of the basic geometrical characteristics of annular cracks on the periodic changes of the local flexural stiffness of the shaft, caused by the machine weight, as well as on the machine dynamic behaviour. This investigation has shown that annular cracks cause only minor changes of the shaft supersynchronous vibrations.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of finite-part integration of hypersingular boundary integrals {{is discussed in}} the context of the applications in engineering fracture mechanics. The approach uses a formulation of the Gauss-Jacobi interpolative quadrature, which can be applied in the same form and with equal success to regular Cauchy-singular and hypersingular integrals that arise in crack problems. The method therefore avoids the artificial device of separating the singularity that usually gives rise to additional numerical effort and reduced accuracy. The quadrature formulae are presented in terms of Jacobi polynomials p n (α,β) and the associated function q n (α,β). The key properties and the numerical evaluation procedures for these functions are described. The efficiency of the hypersingular Gaussian quadrature technique is demonstrated using the example of an <b>annular</b> <b>crack</b> subjected to remote tension.

40|$|The {{mechanics}} {{governing the}} lateral cracks that form when a hard object plastically penetrates a ceramic is presented. The roles of indentation load, penetration depth, {{and work of}} in-dentation are all highlighted, as are the influences of the me-chanical properties of the material. A closed form solution for cracking induced by expansion of a two-dimensional cavity is used to bring out essential features related to parametric de-pendence and scaling. The three-dimensional axisymmetric problem for an <b>annular</b> <b>crack</b> driven by a rigid spherical or conical indenter is solved using numerical methods. The region of highest tensile stress is identified corresponding to the loca-tion where a crack {{is most likely to}} nucleate. This location co-incides with the depth below the surface where the crack will expand parallel to the surface under mode I conditions. The solutions have been substantiated by comparison with measure-ments of the cracks that form upon Vickers indentation. The basic formula for the crack radius has been used to predict trends in cracking upon static penetration and impact by a pro-jectile. In both cases, the extent of the cracking is substantial-ly diminished by increasing the toughness of the material. The yield strength has a much smaller effect. The cracks caused by penetration and the volume removed per impact both decrease marginally at higher yield strength. I...|$|E
