5|$|IV. Allegro. This {{movement}} {{is written in}} 6/8 and in tarantella style, and is characterised by a relentless galloping rhythm calling on demanding pianistic effects with frequent hand-crossing and leaps across registers. It employs the three-key exposition, a recurrent element in Schubert's style. The first theme shifts from C minor to C major – another Schubertian feature, and contains many allusions to D-flat major, which finally becomes established in a climactic reference to the Adagio's characteristic plagal cadence. The second theme, proceeding with the enharmonic parallel minor of this cadence (C-sharp minor), further develops the cadence in its alternation of tonic and subdominant tonalities. After a series of modulations, the exposition ends in the traditional relative major, E-flat. The development section begins in C-flat with a new theme, derived from the last bars of the exposition. Later on, additional material from the exposition is developed, gradually building up towards a climax. The recapitulation is also written in three keys; the first theme is drastically shortened, {{and this time the}} second theme veers to B-flat minor, the result being that the closing section appears in the traditional tonic. The coda begins with a long anticipatory passage which stresses A-flat, the submediant, and then reintroduces the first theme, restoring the most of the music omitted from its reprise. This last passage is characterized by sweeping arpeggios with violent dynamic contrasts - a series of subito fortissimo decaying to piano, following {{the rise and fall of}} the melody. On the last iteration, the melody hits triple forte at the zenith of its register and then plunges four octaves in a descending <b>arpeggio,</b> poco a poco diminuendo al pianissimo. An emphatic cadence then concludes the piece.|$|E
5|$|IV. Rondo: Allegretto – Presto. This lyrical rondo {{movement}} {{consists of}} flowing triplet movement and endless songful melody. Its form is a sonata-rondo (A–B–A–development–A–B–A–coda). The Rondo's main and opening theme {{is taken from}} the slow movement of the sonata D. 537 of 1817. Charles Fisk {{has pointed out that}} this theme would make musical sense as a response subsequent to the questioning leading tone that closes the Allegro's opening fanfare; in this capacity the Rondo's lyricism is the dramatically delayed final goal of the sonata. The second thematic group is written in the traditional dominant key; however, it is very long, modulating through many different subdominant tonalities. The development section, in contrast, culminates in a long passage in C-sharp minor with a climax characterized by a tension-building ambiguity between E major and C-sharp minor and a greatly prolonged evasion of a cadence. This leads to a false recapitulation in F-sharp major, which then modulates to begin again in the home key. In the coda, the main theme returns fragmented, with full bar pauses, which lead each time to unexpected changes of key. This is followed by an agitated presto section, based on the final bars of the main theme, and the sonata concludes with a bold evocation of its very opening measures, with an ascending <b>arpeggio</b> (essentially an inversion of the descending figure from the Allegro's second phrase), followed by a fortissimo full statement of the opening fanfare in retrograde.|$|E

25|$|Satriani is {{considered}} a highly technical guitarist, and {{has been referred to}} as a top guitar virtuoso. Satriani has mastered many performance techniques on electric guitar, including legato, two-handed tapping and <b>arpeggio</b> tapping, volume swells, harmonics and extreme whammy bar effects. During fast passages, Satriani favors a legato technique (achieved primarily through hammer-ons and pull-offs) that yields smooth and flowing runs. He is also adept at other speed-related techniques such as rapid alternate picking and sweep picking. Satriani was influenced by blues-rock guitar icons such as Jimi Hendrix, Brian May, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore and Jeff Beck, as well as jazz fusion guitarist Allan Holdsworth.|$|E
25|$|The main {{instrument}} {{associated with}} the morna is the guitar, popularly called “violão” in Cape Verde. In its most simple form, a guitar is enough to provide the accompaniment for another solo instrument that can be another guitar, a violin (popularly called “rabeca” in Cape Verde), the singer’s voice or any other melodic instrument. The specific way of strumming the strings in a guitar is popularly called “mãozada” in Cape Verde. The strumming of the morna articulates a bass (played with the thumb, marking the accentuation of the rhythm) with chords (played with the other fingers, either in an <b>arpeggio,</b> rhythmically, or in a combination of both). The morna can also be performed on a piano, with the left hand providing the bass and the accompaniment and the right hand providing the accompaniment and the melody.|$|E

500|$|... "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] {{is played}} at a tempo of 126 beats per minute. The {{introduction}} and outro are {{played in a}} 3/4 time signature, while {{the remainder of the}} song is in a common 4/4 signature. The songs opens with an instrumental section, starting with chorale-like sustained synthesiser notes. The guitar fades in after 42 seconds; this part consists of a repeated [...] "chiming" [...] six-note <b>arpeggio.</b> A [...] "dotted eighth" [...] delay effect is used to [...] "play" [...] each note in the <b>arpeggio</b> twice, thus creating a rich sound. The bass and drums enter at 1:10.|$|E

500|$|This {{development}} {{reaches a}} climax {{during the first}} chorus at the line [...] "burning down love" [...] (A–G–F–D); the melody progresses {{through a series of}} scale degrees that lead to the highest note in the song, the A4 at [...] "burning". In later choruses, Bono sings [...] "blown by the wind" [...] with the same melody, stretching the same note even longer. After the third chorus, the song's outro is played, the instrumentation reverting to the same state {{as it was in the}} introduction, with a six-note guitar <b>arpeggio</b> played against sustained synthesiser notes.|$|E

500|$|... "Indestructible" [...] is an uptempo ballad {{that uses}} string {{sections}} and a pulsating beat. The song {{makes use of}} a synthpop style, and incorporates elements Europop. It carries a 4/4 beat that is driven by an [...] "endlessly looped" [...] <b>arpeggio.</b> The song utilizes ascending keyboard bubbles, disco claps, drum machines and whistles as backing. The string sounds from the acoustic version of the song are accompanied by four-to-the-floor beats and an electronic arrangement, as well as [...] "relentless" [...] bass and pulsing synthesized chords. Molly Lambert of Pitchfork noted the [...] "human quality" [...] of Robyn's voice on the track, writing that it is [...] "cloaked in waves of arpeggiated synth".|$|E

Lauren Martin of Fact called the song {{the start of}} Timbaland's [...] "Bollywood influenced 'Indian Flute' era" [...] and a tease; Timberlake's voice is redistributed, with wider range and suspense.|$|E
500|$|... "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] {{is a song}} by Irish {{rock band}} U2. [...] It is the opening track from their 1987 album The Joshua Tree and was {{released}} as the album's third single in August 1987. The song's hook is a repeating guitar <b>arpeggio</b> using a delay effect, played during the song's introduction and again at the end. Lead vocalist Bono wrote the lyrics {{in response to the}} notion {{that it is possible to}} identify a person's religion and income based on the street on which they lived, particularly in Belfast. During the band's difficulties recording the song, producer Brian Eno considered erasing the song's tapes to have them start from scratch.|$|E

The novelty of this étude is its broad right hand <b>arpeggios</b> in semiquavers (sixteenth notes). These nonstop <b>arpeggios,</b> based mostly on chords of the tenth and covering up to six octaves, surpass the drier octave <b>arpeggios</b> of earlier piano composers such as Beethoven, Clementi or Czerny in richness of overtones {{as well as in}} difficulty.

500|$|The {{titles in}} the series feature a variety of music, but {{frequently}} reuse themes. Most of the games open with a piece called [...] "Prelude", which has evolved from a simple, 2-voice <b>arpeggio</b> in the early games to a complex, melodic arrangement in recent installments. Victories in combat are often accompanied by a victory fanfare, a theme that {{has become one of}} the most recognized pieces of music in the series. The basic theme that accompanies Chocobo appearances has been rearranged in a different musical style for each installment. A piece called [...] "Prologue" [...] (and sometimes [...] "Final Fantasy"), originally featured in the first game, is often played during the ending credits. Although leitmotifs are common in the more character-driven installments, theme music is typically reserved for main characters and recurring plot elements.|$|E
500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, [...] "The Power of Good-Bye" [...] {{begins with a}} four-chord <b>arpeggio</b> sequence. It has [...] "catchy" [...] melody phrases during the verses and a synth trumpet {{at the end of}} the first chorus, as well as Armstrong's strings present in the background. It also {{contains}} sustained notes on the instrumental sections, a characteristic for the songs on Ray of Light. Doubled acoustic guitar chords give an organic vibe during the beginning of the second verse, following a brief coda. The song also infuses computer blips and techno effect sounds, which Orbit achieved by using a Korg MS-20 analog synthesizer. The producer explained that [...] "here's something about [...] transient peaks that are very spiky. And you can make that machine scream. Its two filters are very severe".|$|E
500|$|The {{songs are}} {{characterized}} by droning harmonies, simple chord progression, keyboard ostinatos, ringing guitar, resounding reverb, slight bass grooves, and programmed beats. Sim plays counterpoint melodies on his bass, while Croft plays angular figures, sketchy musical patterns, and melodies developed from two-note intervals; Price likens Croft's use of the guitar to playing a harp. Smith's production is {{largely responsible for the}} music's lowest frequency sounds and incorporates both four on the floor and 2-step beats, subtle BPM changes, heartbeat-like drum machine rhythms, strings, and live percussion such as timpani, snare drums, and steelpans. The latter instrument is played in <b>arpeggio</b> and exhibits Jamaican music influences. Critic Will Hermes views Smith as a more prominent contributor on Coexist than on the debut album and comments that [...] "the beats and musical backdrops are more varied and command more attention." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Hold Tight" [...] is a [...] "reflective and sombre" [...] midtempo pop ballad, having {{atmospheric}} keyboards, military {{drums and}} flourishes of pastel electronics as its main instrumentation. Its [...] "tribal" [...] chorus [...] "gallops euphorically over twinkling <b>arpeggio,</b> picked {{out by a}} Juno whistle", which according to The Quietus Amy Pettifer, is [...] "reminiscent of Kate Bush's 'Running Up that Hill'. John Marrs of Gay Times noted the song's synths remind of [...] "Confessions on a Dance Floor"'s 'Forbidden Love' and the [...] "euphoric instrumentals" [...] of British electronica band Faithless. Lyrically, the song talks about holding on and being strong, with Madonna singing about being [...] "scarred and bruised". For Adam R. Holz of Plugged In, the song permeates in the same lyrical content of [...] "Living for Love", while Pettifer noted that it's [...] "a galvanising anthem of shoulder-to-shoulder survival that's collective and communal, rather than intimate and romantic." ...|$|E
500|$|A soundtrack {{album was}} {{released}} {{together with the}} score of Final Fantasy II in 1989. Some of the game's tracks became mainstays to the Final Fantasy series: the [...] "Prelude", the <b>arpeggio</b> played on the title screen; the [...] "Opening Theme", which is played when the party crosses the bridge {{early in the game}} and later referred to as the Final Fantasy theme; and the [...] "Victory Fanfare", which is played after every victorious battle. The opening motif of the battle theme has also been reused a number of times in the series. The theme song that plays when the player characters first cross the bridge from Coneria has become the recurring theme music of the series and has been featured in most numbered Final Fantasy titles. Final Fantasy was also the basis for the series finale of a video game-themed cartoon series [...] entitled [...] "The Fractured Fantasy of Captain N". 8-Bit Theater, a sprite-based webcomic created by Brian Clevinger, parodies the game, and has become very popular in the gaming community since it started in March 2001.|$|E
