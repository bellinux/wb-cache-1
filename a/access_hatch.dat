5|$|In Chicago, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Henry Weems wins $100,000 playing poker against a mobster named Joe Cutrona, though Weems appears ignorant of the basic rules of poker. Suspecting that Weems cheated, Cutrona {{attempts}} to kill him by throwing him off the 29th story of the building they are in. After Weems lands in an <b>access</b> <b>hatch</b> to a basement, he stands right back up and walks away, completely uninjured. Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who promptly take the case. Mulder initially believes the man has the ability to cure himself, but Scully thinks he may just be very lucky by landing in a pile of laundry that was right under the <b>access</b> <b>hatch.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another rare variant was the Bergepanzer IV armored {{recovery}} vehicle. Some {{were believed}} to have been converted locally, 21 were converted from hulls returned for repair between October 1944 and January 1945. The conversion involved removing the turret and adding a wooden plank cover with an <b>access</b> <b>hatch</b> over the turret ring and the addition of a 2-ton jib crane and rigid towing bars.|$|E
5|$|MOL Launches {{would have}} been {{conducted}} from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In 1966, a test flight was launched from LC-40, using a Titan IIIC. It consisted of the Gemini B spacecraft, built from the spacecraft used for the Gemini 2 test flight, atop OPS 0855, a boilerplate MOL space station. Gemini B was released on a suborbital trajectory, and descended to Earth to test modifications made to the heat shield, and ensure that the <b>access</b> <b>hatch</b> would not affect its performance. OPS 0855 continued on to orbit. Early MOL stations would have only been manned by a single crew, launched with the station. Later stations {{would have been}} designed to be resupplied, and support multiple crews, delivered by additional Gemini spacecraft, or derivatives.|$|E
50|$|This GRP {{model was}} {{introduced}} in 1987, combining the structural improvements of the Mark II with greater storage space in the bow. A horizontal bulkhead divides the bow buoyancy tank, and both {{the upper and lower}} sections have large <b>access</b> <b>hatches</b> creating secure stowage spaces.|$|R
50|$|The main {{electrical}} system is Toshiba's {{gate turn-off thyristor}} field chopper control used in the 1000 series. For maintenance of the DC compound motors, {{it is necessary to}} inspect and maintain the brushes, so each motored car has <b>access</b> <b>hatches</b> in the floor of the car.|$|R
40|$|The {{structures}} and mechanical subsystem {{of a space}} station are considered. The subsystem includes basic structure (pressurization, equipment support, meteoroid protection, radiators, insulation, and docking interfaces), the docking mechanisms, spacecraft <b>access</b> (<b>hatches,</b> airlocks, and view ports), and antenna deployment mechanisms. Checkout is {{discussed in terms of}} reliability, failure analysis, and maintenance...|$|R
25|$|Unlike other {{submarines}} in her class, Onslow {{was fitted}} with a four-man diver <b>access</b> <b>hatch,</b> allowing for easier deployment and recovery of special forces divers.|$|E
500|$|The British Rocket Group, {{headed by}} the taciturn Professor Bernard Quatermass, {{launches}} its first manned rocket into space. Shortly thereafter, all contact is lost with the rocket and its three crew: Carroon, Reichenheim, and Green. The large rocket later returns to earth, crashing into an English country field. [...] Quatermass and his assistant Marsh arrive at the scene, along with the local emergency services, Carroon's wife Judith, [...] Rocket Group physician Dr. Briscoe, and Blake, a Ministry official who chides him repeatedly for launching the rocket on impulse and without official permission. [...] Finally opening the rocket's <b>access</b> <b>hatch,</b> the space-suited Carroon stumbles outside; inside, {{there is no sign}} of the other two crew members. Carroon is in shock, only able to say the words [...] "Help me". Inside the rocket, Quatermass and Marsh can find no sign of the other two crewmen, only their completely-fastened spacesuits.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} what might be popularly termed an [...] "oubliette" [...] is the [...] {{particularly}} claustrophobic cell in the dungeon of Warwick Castle's Caesar's Tower, in central England. [...] The <b>access</b> <b>hatch</b> consists of an iron grille. [...] Even turning around (or moving at all) would be nearly impossible in this tiny chamber.|$|E
50|$|Every 600 m or {{so there}} are <b>access</b> <b>hatches.</b> These were meant for {{periodic}} maintenance from the inside by workers. A man would lie prone on a cart and scrape moss off {{the inside of the}} pipe and clear sediments, rocks and dead fish which inevitably backed up in places. Placed on top of these hatches were wire mesh domes, which reduced pressure build up and helped aerate the water.|$|R
25|$|An {{alternative}} design used counterbalance {{weights to}} raise the fort. This allowed the fort to be raised by the physical strength of the garrison. This design had two <b>access</b> <b>hatches</b> and, with a slightly larger underground chamber {{and the elimination of}} the central pneumatic ram the fort could have a crew of four men. Under consideration in late 1940, this alternative design was not used in significant numbers and only about a dozen were installed.|$|R
50|$|Incorporated {{into the}} design are {{considerations}} for filling and unwatering (e.g., air release/vacuum valves, filling/unwatering procedures and requirements for pumping), {{as well as the}} need and means for metering of flows during operation. Accommodations to inspect and maintain the tunnel is access through the shaft conduits by proper sizing of manholes and <b>access</b> <b>hatches,</b> invert gradients (the tunnel must generally slope toward the access shafts) and locating the metering devices at accessible locations.|$|R
2500|$|The lazarette {{contains}} a built in outboard well, which includes <b>access</b> <b>hatch</b> and well plug. This well is bulkheaded {{off from the}} main hull and is of the self-draining, non-filling type. There is an access door through the bulkhead for outboard operation [...] A shelf for gasoline tanks and a well plug that fairs the well opening in the hull for racing is supplied.|$|E
2500|$|To help {{balance the}} new engine, the radio {{equipment}} was moved further {{back in the}} rear fuselage and the <b>access</b> <b>hatch</b> was moved from the left fuselage side to the right. Better VHF radio equipment allowed for the aerial mast to be removed and replaced by a [...] "whip" [...] aerial further aft on the fuselage spine. Because the longer nose and the increased slipstream of the big five-bladed propeller a new tail unit with a taller, broader fin and a rudder of increased area was adopted.|$|E

The circles represent centrifuges and the squares various incubators and refrigerators. The laboratory was about 9.5 metres wide.|$|R
25|$|The {{first version}} of the 109 to have wing guns was the C-1, which had one MG 17 in each wing. To avoid {{redesigning}} the wing to accommodate large ammunition boxes and <b>access</b> <b>hatches,</b> an unusual ammunition feed was devised whereby a continuous belt holding 500 rounds was fed along chutes out to the wing tip, around a roller and then back along the wing, forward and beneath the gun breech, to the wing root, where it coursed around another roller {{and back to the}} weapon.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} gun <b>access</b> <b>hatch</b> was retained however, allowing Alliance to {{be equipped}} with a small calibre deck gun again when serving in the Far East during the Indonesian Confrontation of the earlier 1960s.|$|E
50|$|An <b>access</b> <b>hatch</b> {{was moved}} from the {{starboard}} rear fuselage to underneath, and an extra longitudinal stiffening strake, identical to that already fitted to the starboard side of production Mosquitos, was fitted to the port fuselage.|$|E
50|$|Extensive {{damage to}} trees on {{surrounding}} private timberland also corroborate the extreme intensity of this tempest. The pressure {{of wind and}} wave on the Hood Canal Bridge stressed the structure enough to cause catastrophic failure. It is suspected that a severe list in the bridge exposed pontoon <b>access</b> <b>hatches</b> to the waves, which subsequently tore the covers loose and allowed water to enter the flotation devices, causing sections to sink. It took nearly three years and over $140 million U.S. to rebuild the lost bridge.|$|R

50|$|Sit-on-top kayaks come in 1-4 paddler configurations. Sit-on-top kayaks are {{particularly}} popular for fishing and SCUBA diving, since participants need to easily enter and exit the water, change seating positions, and <b>access</b> <b>hatches</b> and storage wells. Ordinarily {{the seat of}} a sit-on-top is slightly above water level, so {{the center of gravity}} for the paddler is higher than in a traditional kayak. To compensate for the higher center of gravity, sit-on-tops are often wider and slower than a traditional kayak of the same length.|$|R

50|$|The wharf {{sustained}} damage during the January 2011 Brisbane floods. Initially repair work {{was expected to}} take up to 18 months, but a survey by engineers showed that the timber access boardwalk, concrete waiting area and steel roof were intact, along with the mooring piles. The floating pontoon was full of water (due to overtopping into the <b>access</b> <b>hatches</b> on the deck), but was still connected to the mooring piles down on the river bed, and was recovered and refloated. A new aluminium gangway was fabricated, and the wharf reopened on 18 April 2011, {{three months after the}} flood event.|$|R
5000|$|The Provost was an all-metal, single-engined, two-seat monoplane; it had fixed {{conventional}} {{landing gear}} with a fully castoring tailwheel. Production aircraft were powered by a single [...] Alvis Leonides 25 radial piston engine. The Provost was twice as powerful as the preceding Percival Prentice. The Provost had a roll rate and handling similar to the best fighters upon entering service, it was also known for its rapid rate of climb and generous power provision from its engine. The type {{was designed to be}} easy to maintain; various components were intentionally interchangeable where possible and there was a generous provision of <b>access</b> <b>hatches</b> in the fuselage.|$|R

2500|$|The {{flight deck}} and {{operational}} spaces, common areas, passenger cabins, and public toilet facilities on the Graf Zeppelin were all {{contained in a}} single contiguous [...] "gondola" [...] structure built into the forward third of the airship's ventral surface. The forward operational spaces consisted of the flight deck, a navigation room with two large open <b>access</b> <b>hatches</b> to allow the command crew {{to communicate with the}} navigators, radio room, galley, and a short passage to the main entrance-exit door [...] space. An ascending ladder located in the map room allowed access to a keel corridor inside the hull. The map room also had two large windows, one on each side, which permitted navigators to shoot the horizon and sky with a sextant.|$|R
50|$|In oil tankers {{and other}} marine vessels used for {{transporting}} fluid products, there are small service openings though the deck into each tank to allow access for miscellaneous reasons such as sampling, inspection, gauging and cleaning. When the service opening {{is not in}} use, it is sealed by a removable cover plate, {{commonly referred to as}} a Butterworth cover. Butterworth hatches are not the main <b>access</b> <b>hatches,</b> but are the servicing hatches, and are generally closed with a metal cover plate with a gasket that is fastened to the deck by a number of bolts which stick up from the deck. Holes on the edges of the plate fit over these bolts and the cover is fastened down with nuts or dogs.|$|R
