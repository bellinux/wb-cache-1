5|$|Connecting the {{cerebellum}} {{to different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent fibers via thalamic nuclei to upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex. The fibers arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its input from the pons mainly from the pontine nuclei. The input to the pons is from the cerebral cortex and is relayed from the pontine nuclei via transverse pontine fibers to the cerebellum. The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its <b>afferent</b> <b>fibers</b> are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs to {{different parts of}} the cerebellum. The inferior cerebellar peduncle receives input from <b>afferent</b> <b>fibers</b> from the vestibular nuclei, spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output from the inferior peduncle is via efferent fibers to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation. The whole of the cerebellum receives modulatory input from the inferior olivary nucleus via the inferior cerebellar peduncle.|$|E

40|$|A {{possibility}} of efferent innervation of gustatory and mechanosensitive <b>afferent</b> <b>fiber</b> endings was studied in frog fungiform papillae with a suction electrode. The amplitude of antidromic impulses in a papillary <b>afferent</b> <b>fiber</b> induced by antidromically stimulating an <b>afferent</b> <b>fiber</b> of glossopharyngeal nerve (GPN) {{with low voltage}} pulses was inhibited for 40 s after the parasympathetic efferent fibers of GPN were stimulated orthodromically with high voltage pulses at 30 Hz for 10 s. This implies that electrical positivity of the outer surface of papillary afferent membrane was reduced by the efferent fiber-induced excitatory postsynaptic potential. The inhibition of afferent responses in the papillae was blocked by substance P receptor blocker, L- 703, 606, indicating that substance P is probably released from the efferent fiber terminals. Slow negative synaptic potential, which corresponded to a slow depolarizing synaptic potential, was extracellularly induced in papillary afferent terminals for 45 s by stimulating the parasympathetic efferent fibers of GPN with high voltage pulses at 30 Hz for 10 s. This synaptic potential was also blocked by L- 703, 606. These data indicate that papillary <b>afferent</b> <b>fiber</b> endings are innervated by parasympathetic efferent fibers.

25|$|Hyperexcitability hypothesizes that {{referred}} pain has no central mechanism. However, it does {{say that there}} is one central characteristic that predominates. Experiments involving noxious stimuli and recordings from the dorsal horn of animals revealed that {{referred pain}} sensations began minutes after muscle stimulation. Pain was felt in a receptive field that was some distance away from the original receptive field. According to hyperexcitability, new receptive fields are created {{as a result of the}} opening of latent convergent <b>afferent</b> <b>fibers</b> in the dorsal horn. This signal could then be perceived as referred pain.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} electroreceptor {{model of the}} A- and B-receptors of the weakly {{electric}} fish Gnathonemus petersii. The model consists of a sensory cell, whose membrane is separated into an apical and basal portions by support cells, and an <b>afferent</b> <b>fiber.</b> The apical membrane of the cell contains only leak channels, while the basal membrane contains voltage-sensitive Ca 2 + channels, voltage-sensitive and Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels, and leak channels. The <b>afferent</b> <b>fiber</b> is described with the modified Hodgkin-Huxley equation, in which the voltage-sensitive gate of the K+ channels is a dynamic variable. In our model we suggest that the electroreceptors detect and process the information provided by an electric organ discharge (EOD) as follows: the current caused by an EOD stimulus depolarizes the basal membrane to a greatly depolarized state. Then the release of transmitter excites the <b>afferent</b> <b>fiber</b> to oscillate after a certain time interval. Due to the resistance-capacitance structure of the cells, they not only perceive the EOD intensity, but also sense the variation of the EOD waveform, which can be strongly distorted by the capacitive component of an object. Because of the different morphologies of A- and B-cells, {{as well as the}} different conductance of leak ion channels in the apical membrane and the different capacitance of A- and B-cells, A-receptors mainly respond to the EOD intensity, while B-receptors are sensitive to the variation of EOD waveform...|$|R
25|$|Axon reflex {{suggests}} that the <b>afferent</b> <b>fiber</b> is bifurcated before connecting to the dorsal horn. Bifurcated fibers do exist in muscle, skin, and intervertebral discs. Yet these particular neurons are rare and are not representative of the whole body. Axon-Reflex also does not explain the time delay before the appearance of referred pain, threshold differences for stimulating local and referred pain, and somatosensory sensibility changes {{in the area of}} referred pain.|$|R
25|$|The sensory {{modality}} that {{is detected}} by the <b>afferent</b> <b>fibers</b> {{is an important}} factor to consider because it determines the pathway that the dorsal root ganglion neurons will take within the central nervous system. The sensory neurons coming from the body synapse in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, bringing in information about touch sensations (epicritic), or modalities of pain (protopathic). While both types of sensory neurons must first synapse in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, the area of the dorsal horn where they synapse is different. Their pathway to the thalamus is also different.|$|E

An average of 433 cells were identified {{on each side of}} the animal. 85percent and 15percent of the labeled cells were located in the S1 and S2 dorsal root ganglia, respectively.

40|$|The {{cerebellum}} {{is important}} for motor control, cognition, and language processing. <b>Afferent</b> and efferent <b>fibers</b> are major components of cerebellar circuitry and impairment of these circuits causes severe cerebellar malfunction, such as ataxia. The cerebellum receives information from two major afferent types – climbing fibers and mossy fibers. In addition, a third set of afferents project to the cerebellum as neuromodulatory fibers.
