Palm oil is an essential ingredient in local cuisine. As a carefully preserved condiment, it is combined with plain rice on holidays. The oil comes from the fruit clusters which are picked by men and then deseeded, allowed to dry, crushed in a mortar, and boiled by women.|$|E

40|$|Dissertation {{submitted}} in part-fu 1 fi~entof the M-Tech Business Administration in the Facu 1 ty of Business at the Peninsu 1 a Technikon, 2002 The {{closure of}} Marine Oil Refiners (MOR) in 1999 was probably inevitable if {{results of the}} Greenpeace protests against the consumption of unsustainable fish oil in 1996 were evaluated. The world's largest biscuit factories excluded fish oil from their ingredients and companies like Unilever responded in a similar manner. However MOR's closure was unexpected and therefore the South African market shift did not align with the international market changes. This research project explores {{one of the problems}} with which the fishing industry is confronted with. In particular, the research focuses on the distribution of the fish oil produced in the Fishing Industry after the closure of MOR in July 1999, which was the sole consumer of fish oil. The closure of MOR has effectively left South African and Namibian fish oil-producing companies without an established South African market to sell to. This research deals with marketing strategies for the fish oil producing companies, the problems associated with these strategies and the examination of available alternative solutions to this problem. The effect of changes in the chicken feed market segment on the fishmeal & oil industry will also be addressed. One of the aims of this research was to clarify the factors that impact on the consumption of the current South <b>African</b> fish <b>oil</b> market. The research concluded that the following are important factors that impact on the South <b>African</b> fish <b>oil</b> consumption: Quality of the oil The international fish oil price Comparative competitive prices of fish oil substitutes The growing and declining demand of the different fish oil application markets. The price of heavy furnace oil compared to fish oil selling price. (Heavy furnace oil is used to generate energy).
