25|$|The {{pyruvate}} {{produced by}} glycolysis {{is an important}} intermediary in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids and cholesterol. This occurs via the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrion. However, this <b>acetyl</b> <b>CoA</b> needs to be transported into cytosol where the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol occurs. This cannot occur directly. To obtain cytosolic acetyl-CoA, citrate (produced by the condensation of <b>acetyl</b> <b>CoA</b> with oxaloacetate) {{is removed from the}} citric acid cycle and carried across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol. There it is cleaved by ATP citrate lyase into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate can be used for gluconeogenesis (in the liver), or it can be returned into mitochondrion as malate. The cytosolic acetyl-CoA is carboxylated by <b>acetyl</b> <b>CoA</b> carboxylase into malonyl CoA, the first committed step in the synthesis of fatty acids.|$|E
25|$|In the {{citric acid}} cycle all the {{intermediates}} (e.g. citrate, iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate and oxaloacetate) are regenerated during each {{turn of the}} cycle. Adding more {{of any of these}} intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that that additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence the addition of oxaloacetate greatly increases the amounts of all the citric acid intermediates, thereby increasing the cycle's capacity to metabolize <b>acetyl</b> <b>CoA,</b> converting its acetate component into CO2 and water, with the release of enough energy to form 11 ATP and 1 GTP molecule for each additional molecule of <b>acetyl</b> <b>CoA</b> that combines with oxaloacetate in the cycle.|$|E

50|$|Citrate synthase {{has three}} key amino acids in its active site (known as the {{catalytic}} triad) which catalyze {{the conversion of}} acetyl-CoA H3CC(=O)−SCoA and oxaloacetate −O2CCH2C(=O)CO2− into citrate −O2CCH2C(OH)(CO2−)CH2CO2− and H−SCoA in an aldol condensation reaction. This conversion begins with the negatively charged carboxylate side chain oxygen atom of Asp-375 deprotonating <b>acetyl</b> <b>CoA’s</b> alpha carbon atom to form an enolate anion {{which in turn is}} neutralized by protonation by His-274 to form an enol intermediate H2C=C(OH)−SCoA. At this point, the epsilon nitrogen lone pair of electrons on His-274 formed in the last step abstracts the hydroxyl enol proton to reform an enolate anion that initiates a nucleophilic attack on the oxaloacetate’s carbonyl carbon −O2CCH2C(=O)CO2− which in turn deprotonate the epsilon nitrogen atom of His-320. This nucleophilic addition results in the formation of citroyl−CoA −O2CCH2CH(CO2−)CH2C(=O)−SCoA. At this point, a water molecule is deprotonated by the epsilon nitrogen atom of His-320 and hydrolysis is initiated. One of the oxygen’s lone pairs nucleophilically attacks the carbonyl carbon of citroyl−CoA. This forms a tetrahedral intermediate and results in the ejection of −SCoA as the carbonyl reforms. The −SCoA is protonated to form HSCoA. Finally, the hydroxyl added to the carbonyl in the previous step is deprotonated and citrate −O2CCH2C(OH)(CO2−)CH2CO2− is formed.|$|R

500|$|Cytokinins are a {{class of}} plant hormones named for their control of cell {{division}} or cytokinesis. The natural cytokinin zeatin was discovered in corn, Zea mays, and is a derivative of the purine adenine. Zeatin is produced in roots and transported to shoots in the xylem where it promotes cell division, bud development, and the greening of chloroplasts. The gibberelins, such as Gibberelic acid are diterpenes synthesised from <b>acetyl</b> <b>CoA</b> via the mevalonate pathway. They {{are involved in the}} promotion of germination and dormancy-breaking in seeds, in regulation of plant height by controlling stem elongation and the control of flowering. Abscisic acid (ABA) occurs in all land plants except liverworts, and is synthesised from carotenoids in the chloroplasts and other plastids. It inhibits cell division, promotes seed maturation, and dormancy, and promotes stomatal closure. It was so named because it was originally thought to control abscission. Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that is produced in all higher plant tissues from methionine. It is now known to be the hormone that stimulates or regulates fruit ripening and abscission, and it, or the synthetic growth regulator ethephon which is rapidly metabolised to produce ethylene, are used on industrial scale to promote ripening of cotton, pineapples and other climacteric crops.|$|E

Acetyl-CoA was the major product detectable after incubation of nPHB granules in the presence of NAD+, indicating that downstream mobilizing enzyme activities were also present and active in isolated nPHB granules. We propose that intracellular concentrations of key metabolites (CoA, acetyl-CoA, 3 HB-CoA, NAD+/NADH) determine whether a cell accumulates or degrades PHB.

The previously observed incorporation of C- 3 from serine into methylmercury was confirmed by measurement of relatively high activities of serine hydroxymethyltransferase and other enzymes of this pathway. High rates of label incorporation into methylmercury from H 14 COO- and H 14 CO 3 - prompted the assay of enzymes of the <b>acetyl</b> coenzyme A (<b>CoA)</b> synthase pathway. These enzymes were found to be present but at activity levels much lower than those reported for acetogens. Propyl iodide inhibited methylmercury and acetyl-CoA syntheses to similar extents, and methylmercury synthesis was found to compete with acetyl-CoA synthesis for methyl groups. On the basis of these findings, we propose that in methylmercury synthesis by D. desulfuricans LS the methyl group is transferred from CH 3 -tetrahydrofolate via methylcobalamin. The methyl group may originate from C- 3 of serine or from formate via the acetyl-CoA synthase pathway. These pathways are not unique to D. desulfuricans LS, and thus the ability of this bacterium to methylate mercury is most likely associated with the substrate specificity of its enzymes...|$|R
