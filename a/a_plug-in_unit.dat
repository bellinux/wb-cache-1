30|$|The present job {{designed}} an {{augmented reality}} game based on SIFT image recognition built on C/S structure. This game {{was divided into}} subsystems of cloud management and intelligent mobile terminal management. In this game, players can use both cloud database images and random images grabbed during game playing for image recognition which can be utilized for new game scene designing. To accelerate image recognition, in this paper, SIFT algorithm was improved by setting optimizing parameters and eliminating wrong matching points. The improved SIFT algorithm was integrated in Easy AR and working as <b>a</b> <b>plug-in</b> <b>unit</b> in the cloud server. The game is currently testing in laboratories before a hopeful public marketing.|$|E

2500|$|With {{automated}} starters such as glow starters, {{a failing}} tube will cycle endlessly, flickering as the lamp quickly goes out because the emission mix {{is insufficient to}} keep the lamp current high {{enough to keep the}} glow starter open. This runs the ballast at higher temperature. Some more advanced starters time out in this situation, and do not attempt repeated starts until power is reset. Some older systems used a thermal over-current trip to detect repeated starting attempts and disable the circuit until manually reset. [...] The switch contacts in glow starters are subject to wear and inevitably fail eventually, so the starter is manufactured as <b>a</b> <b>plug-in</b> replaceable <b>unit.</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis work is {{a result}} of studies done at Saab Surveillance, with the {{objective}} to evaluate cooling technologies and find out which of them that are or are not suited to be implemented on a generic house and plug-in units, meeting the higher thermal demands of the future. This task includes five products, all with their own pros and cons created by Thermacore, a company of advanced cooling technologies with its European head office located in Ashington, England. First up was to realize under which circumstances these products were supposed to operate. This included application areas like land, sea and air which all have different grades of requirements set for today’s generic houses and plug-in units. To find the answers for these factors a trip to England and Thermacore was made and together with their engineers, hypothetical thermal simulations could be developed but also gather a wide understanding of each technology´s possibilities and limits. When all the information was assembled an extended evaluation process could be completed. The result showed that the superior cooling technology differed depending on mainly two things. The first one was taken in regard of which application area it was supposed to operate in but also where it is being implemented either in a generic house or on <b>a</b> <b>plug-in</b> <b>unit.</b> In conclusion of this report it showed that for the plug-in unit the recommended technology for land and sea units was to be a heat pipe assembly. The construction contains four flattened heat pipes encapsulated in an aluminum plate. Regarding air applications and foremost the fighter jets, the most suited technology was the k-Core. It will endure the exposure of both high vibrations and shocks but above all in an effective way cool the system. For the generic houses and those operating on land and sea it would once again be a heat pipe assembly that is the optimal solution, though those working in air applications the loop heat pipe is the better fit. These results will be discussed and visualized in the report...|$|E
40|$|Schmitt and Ahrens (1983) have {{concluded}} that the type of optical emission produced during shock compression was dependent upon phase changes taking place during shock compression. The present study is concerned with new observations of shock-induced optical radiation from Al 2 O 3, MgO, NaCl, KCl, x-cut and fused SiO 2, and LiF at various pressures up to 75 GPa. The experimental setup used in the study is similar to that employed by Schmitt and Ahrens. An Image Converter Camera with <b>a</b> three-frame <b>plug-in</b> <b>unit</b> was added to take two or three exposures of the radiation field during shock wave propagation through the sample, taking into account exposure times in the range from 50 to 500 nsec. The greybody emissions observed in LiF, which undergoes no phase transition, imply that localized heating and perhaps melting occurs in this material during shock deformation...|$|R

40|$|The authors propose {{solutions}} for constructing mechanical structures for electronic equipment {{in terms of}} <b>plug-in</b> <b>units</b> and subracks, allowing to increase the layout characteristics of electronic modules, sections and desktop devices and increase their functional capacity without changing the architecture of standard mechanical structures. The paper shows effectiveness of the developed solutions. There {{is a problem of}} restraining of mass redundancy of mechanical structures for electronic equipment in relation to the weight of the electronic components. On the other hand, the weight is an indicator of structural strength, providing of which is not less important problem. These problems can be solved in different ways, the main of which are the following: a) development of new mechanical structures for electronic equipment taking into account the development of the electronic components; b) improving layout characteristics of mechanical structures for electronic equipment without significant changes in their architecture. The aim {{of the study was to}} research mechanical structures of the first level (<b>plug-in</b> <b>units</b> and modules of the second level) of subracks to improve layout characteristics, and to develop methods for the use of connections for surface mounting and for the use of printed circuit boards of smaller dimensions without changing the architecture of the mechanical structures in order to improve layout characteristics. The research allowed the authors to develop the following solutions: 1. The design of <b>plug-in</b> <b>units</b> in which instead of one printed circuit board (PCB) may be two, three or more PCBs of smaller dimensions to compensate a decrease in PCB fill factor in time and to increase the functional capacity of electronic modules. 2. Construction of block designs with a bilateral arrangement of <b>plug-in</b> <b>units</b> and the organization of the electrical connections by way of backplanes with electrical connectors for surface mounting, which allows performing independent installation of <b>plug-in</b> <b>units</b> on both sides of the backplane and creates conditions for increasing the number of <b>plug-in</b> <b>units.</b> The proposed solutions do not lead to a change in the architecture of standard mechanical structures for electronic equipment or any performance degradation...|$|R
