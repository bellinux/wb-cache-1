40|$|A {{state space}} process control model {{involving}} deterministic drift {{of the process}} mean and adjustment error is presented. A Kalman filter estimator of the process mean is developed. Optimal adjustment strategies based on this Kalman filter estimator are developed by the technique of dynamic programming for two special cases of the model and for the general model. The optimal policy in the general case calls for an adjustment to the process when the estimate of the process mean is outside an interval bounded by lower and upper <b>action</b> <b>limits.</b> The <b>action</b> <b>limits</b> depend on the variability associated with the Kalman estimator. The optimal adjustment consists of compensation for the currently perceived misadjustment of the process mean and the anticipated drift, and possibly, depending {{on the cost of}} adjustment {{and the size of the}} drift, a small over-compensation to anticipate future drift. Computational methods for approximating the <b>action</b> <b>limits</b> and over-compensation constants are presented. The effects of parameter values on these limits and constants are described...|$|R

40|$|Background: Many {{bacteria}} {{of clinical}} importance survive and may grow in different environments. Antibiotic pollution may exert on them a selective pressure {{leading to an}} increase in the prevalence of resistance. Objectives: In this study we sought to determine whether environmental concentrations of antibiotics and concentrations representing <b>action</b> <b>limits</b> used in environmental risk assessment may exert a selective pressure on clinically relevant bacteria in the environment. Methods: We used bacterial inhibition as an assessment end point to link antibiotic selective pressures to the prevalence of resistance in bacterial populations. Species sensitivity distributions were derived for three antibiotics by fitting log-logistic models to end points calculated from minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distributions based on worldwide data collated by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). To place bacteria represented in these distributions in a broader context, we performed a brief phylogenetic analysis. The potentially affected fraction of bacterial genera at measured environmental concentrations of antibiotics and environmental risk assessment <b>action</b> <b>limits</b> was used as a proxy for antibiotic selective pressure. Measured environmental concentrations and environmental risk assessment <b>action</b> <b>limits</b> were also directly compared to wild-type cut-off values. Results: The potentially affected fraction of bacterial genera estimated based on antibiotic concentrations measured in water environments is ≤ 7 %. We estimated that measured environmental concentrations in river sediments, swine feces lagoons, liquid manure, and farmed soil inhibit wild-type populations in up to 60 %, 92 %, 100 %, and 30 % of bacterial genera, respectively. At concentrations used as <b>action</b> <b>limits</b> in environmental risk assessment, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin were estimated to inhibit wild-type populations in up to 25 % and 76 % of bacterial genera. Conclusions: Measured environmental concentrations of antibiotics, as well as concentrations representing environmental risk assessment <b>action</b> <b>limits,</b> are high enough to exert a selective pressure on clinically relevant bacteria that may lead {{to an increase in}} the prevalence of resistance...|$|R

40|$|The {{relation}} between serum cholesterol concentrations and {{the incidence of}} coronary heart disease is continuous and curvilinear; there is neither epidemiological nor biological {{evidence to support the}} existence of a threshold value. There is a clinical need, however, for an acceptable definition of <b>action</b> <b>limits</b> and desirable ranges, based on the evidence that raised cholesterol concentrations are causally related to atherosclerotic heart disease. The European Atherosclerosis Society has proposed a set of cut off points, which, together with age and the presence of other risk factors, direct the clinician to an appropriate level of treatment. Because the changes of serum cholesterol during adult life appear unphysiological, these <b>action</b> <b>limits</b> do not require adjustment for age. The distribution of serum cholesterol in the United Kingdom population is such that a case finding strategy is required to identify the many persons at very high risk of coronary disease.
