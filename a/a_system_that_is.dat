5|$|The safeworking of trains between {{stations}} on {{the early}} lines was time interval working, where a train {{would be allowed to}} leave a given time after the train before it. With heavier traffic this method became unsafe, with Staff and Ticket working on single lines adopted from 1873, and telegraph block working from 1878 on double lines. Both of these systems ensured that only one train would be in a section of track at one time. Telegraphic block working was then replaced with Winters Block working between 1883 and 1888, <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a predecessor of the Double line Block system which is still used today. Later years saw variations made to the Staff and Ticket system, with busier lines provided with Electric Staff working which provided greater safely when more trains ran.|$|E
5|$|Theories {{about the}} origin of {{language}} differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are {{based on the idea that}} language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on Chomsky's generative view of language see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> largely cultural, learned through social interaction.|$|E

40|$|Automatic speaker {{verification}} {{systems are}} increasingly {{used as the}} primary means to authenticate costumers. Recently, it has been proposed to train speaker verification systems using end-to-end deep neural models. In this paper, we show <b>that</b> such <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> vulnerable to adversarial example attack. Adversarial examples are generated by adding a peculiar noise to original speaker examples, {{in such a way}} <b>that</b> they <b>are</b> almost indistinguishable from the original examples by a human listener. Yet, the generated waveforms, which sound as speaker A can be used to fool such <b>a</b> <b>system</b> by claiming as if the waveforms were uttered by speaker B. We present white-box attacks on an end-to-end deep network <b>that</b> <b>was</b> either trained on YOHO or NTIMIT. We also present two black-box attacks: where the adversarial examples <b>were</b> generated with <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> trained on YOHO, but the attack <b>is</b> on <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> trained on NTIMIT; and when the adversarial examples <b>were</b> generated with <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> trained on Mel-spectrum feature set, but the attack <b>is</b> on <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> trained on MFCC.

25|$|It {{follows from}} the second law of {{thermodynamics}} that the entropy of <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not isolated may decrease. An air conditioner, for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, {{in agreement with the}} second law of thermodynamics.|$|E

25|$|Since 1991, Ukrainian {{has been}} the {{official}} state language in Ukraine, and the state administration implemented government policies to broaden the use of Ukrainian.

The government has also mandated a progressively increased role for Ukrainian in the media and commerce. In some cases the abrupt changing of the language of instruction in institutions of secondary and higher education led to the charges of Ukrainianization, raised mostly by the Russian-speaking population. This transition, however, lacked most of the controversies that arose during the de-russification of the other former Soviet Republics.|$|E
25|$|Norwegian {{contributions}} to international crisis management have been generated from <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{first and foremost}} geared towards the rapid activation of mobilization units armed and trained for territorial defence. As a consequence, Norwegian {{contributions to}} international military operations have {{a high degree of}} sustainability, as they have a substantial number of reserve units on which to draw. However, without adaptation this force posture is to a lesser extent able to generate forces rapidly and flexibly in response to international crises. Moreover, the contributions that Norway has been able to make to international operations have tended to consist of lightly armoured mechanized infantry, well-suited for more traditional peacekeeping tasks (UNIFIL in southern Lebanon to which Norway contributed a sizable unit for over twenty years) but not sufficiently robust for missions which might entail enforcement tasks.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two related}} {{definitions}} of entropy: the thermodynamic definition and the statistical mechanics definition. Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the classical thermodynamics viewpoint, {{the system is}} composed of very large numbers of constituents (atoms, molecules) {{and the state of}} the system is described by the average thermodynamic properties of those constituents; the details of the system's constituents are not directly considered, but their behavior is described by macroscopically averaged properties, e.g. temperature, pressure, entropy, heat capacity. The early classical definition of the properties of the system assumed equilibrium. The classical thermodynamic definition of entropy has more recently been extended into the area of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Later, the thermodynamic properties, including entropy, were given an alternative definition in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system — modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, phonons, spins, etc.). The statistical mechanics description of the behavior of a system is necessary as the definition of the properties of a system using classical thermodynamics become an increasingly unreliable method of predicting the final state of <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> subject to some process.|$|E

25|$|At {{the highest}} level, the design may be {{optimized}} to make {{best use of}} the available resources, given goals, constraints, and expected use/load. The architectural design of a system overwhelmingly affects its performance. For example, <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> network latency-bound (where network latency is the main constraint on overall performance) would be optimized to minimize network trips, ideally making a single request (or no requests, as in a push protocol) rather than multiple roundtrips. Choice of design depends on the goals: when designing a compiler, if fast compilation is the key priority, a one-pass compiler is faster than a multi-pass compiler (assuming same work), but if speed of output code is the goal, a slower multi-pass compiler fulfills the goal better, even though it takes longer itself. Choice of platform and programming language occur at this level, and changing them frequently requires a complete rewrite, though a modular system may allow rewrite of only some component – for example, a Python program may rewrite performance-critical sections in C. In a distributed system, choice of architecture (client-server, peer-to-peer, etc.) occurs at the design level, and {{may be difficult to}} change, particularly if all components cannot be replaced in sync (e.g., old clients).|$|E
25|$|When a {{model of}} replicating {{molecules}} was created, it was found that, for effective storage of information, macromolecules on prebiotic Earth could not exceed a certain threshold length. This problem {{is known as the}} error threshold problem. It arises because replication is an imperfect process, and during each replication event, there is a risk of incorporating errors into a new sequence, leading {{to the creation of a}} quasispecies. In <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> deprived of high-fidelity replicases and error-correction mechanisms, mutations occur with a high probability. As a consequence, the information stored in a sequence can be lost due to the rapid accumulation of errors, a so-called error catastrophe. Moreover, it was shown that the genome size of any organism is roughly equal to the inverse of mutation rate per site per replication. Therefore, a high mutation rate imposes a serious limitation on the length of the genome. To overcome this problem, a more specialized replication machinery that is able to copy genetic information with higher fidelity is needed. Manfred Eigen suggested that proteins are necessary to accomplish this task. However, to encode a system as complex as a protein, longer nucleotide sequences are needed, which increases the probability of a mutation even more and requires even more complex replication machinery. This vicious circle is known as Eigen's Paradox.|$|E
500|$|As {{air flows}} {{radially}} inward at low levels, {{it begins to}} rotate cyclonically in order to conserve angular momentum. Similarly, as rapidly rotating air flows radially outward near the tropopause, its cyclonic rotation decreases and ultimately changes sign at large enough radius, resulting in an upper-level anti-cyclone. [...] The result is a vertical structure characterized by a strong cyclone at low levels and a strong anti-cyclone near the tropopause; from thermal wind balance, this corresponds to <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> warmer at its center than in the surrounding environment at all altitudes (i.e. “warm-core”). From hydrostatic balance, the warm core translates to lower pressure at the center at all altitudes, with the maximum pressure drop located at the surface.|$|E

500|$|Since {{the legal}} {{reforms of the}} late 1970s and 1980s, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has moved to embrace the {{language}} {{of the rule of law}} and establish a modern court system.

The concept of [...] "rule of law" [...] was enshrined in the constitution, and the CCP embarked on campaigns to publicize the idea that citizens have protection under the law.

500|$|To {{accommodate}} the video production, {{the equivalent of}} a television studio control room—costing US$3.5million—was built for the tour. Beneath the stage, Dodds, the video director, operated a system custom-built by Philips called CD-i. It used fivebroadcast camera systems, 12Laser Disc players, and a satellite dish, and it required 12directors, 19video crew members, and two separate mix stations to operate. To enable each band member to perform away from their personal monitor speakers on the main stage, sound engineers used joysticks to control a panning matrix for each member's in-ear monitor as they moved around. Despite the production's complexity, the group decided that flexibility in the shows' length and content was a priority. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "That was one of the more important decisions we made early on, that we wouldn't sacrifice flexibility, so we designed <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> both extremely complicated and high-tech but also incredibly simple and hands-on, controlled by human beings... in that sense, it's still a live performance." [...] This flexibility allowed for improvisations and deviations from the planned programme. Eno recommended that U2 film its own video tapes so that they could be edited and looped into the video displays more easily, instead of relying entirely on pre-sequenced video. Eno explained, [...] "their show depends on some kind of response to what's happening at the moment in that place. So if it turns out they want to do a song for five minutes longer, they can actually loop through the material again so that you're not suddenly stuck with black screens halfway through the fifth verse." [...] The band shot new video for the displays {{over the course of the}} tour.|$|E
