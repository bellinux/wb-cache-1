5|$|The {{first of}} these {{planetary}} rings was detected in 1968 by <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> Edward Guinan. In the early 1980s, analysis of this data along with newer observations led to the hypothesis that this ring might be incomplete.|$|E
5|$|Previously, in 2000, <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> P. A.

However, they also observed the daughter of 266Bh, 262Db, undergo alpha decay instead of spontaneous fission: the Japanese team observed the latter decay mode.|$|E

5|$|Al-Qaeda {{had begun}} reconnoitering Nairobi for {{potential}} targets in December 1993, using <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> Ali Mohamed. In January 1994, bin Laden was personally {{presented with the}} team's surveillance reports, {{and he and his}} senior advisers began to develop a plan to attack the American embassy there. From February to June 1998, al-Qaeda prepared to launch their attacks, renting residences, building their bombs, and acquiring trucks; meanwhile, bin Laden continued his public-relations efforts, giving interviews with ABC News and Pakistani journalists. While U.S. authorities had investigated al-Qaeda activities in Nairobi, they had not detected any warnings of imminent attacks.|$|E

5|$|Excavations on Glastonbury Tor, {{undertaken}} by <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> Philip Rahtz between 1964 and 1966, revealed evidence of Dark Age occupation during the 5th to 7th centuries around the later medieval church of St. Michael. Finds included postholes, two hearths including a metalworker's forge, two burials oriented north-south (thus {{unlikely to be}} Christian), fragments of 6th century Mediterranean amphorae (vases for wine or cooking oil), and a worn hollow bronze head which may have topped a Saxon staff.|$|E
5|$|In April 1970, <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> Albert Ghiorso {{working at}} the University of California (Berkeley, California, United States) stepped into the competition. They claimed to have {{synthesized}} the element by bombarding a californium-249 target with nitrogen-15 ions. Alpha activity with the energy of 9.1MeV was formed; the team attempted reaction with other nuclides—bombardment of 249Cf with 14N, Pb with 15N, Hg with 15N—and stated no such activity was found in those reactions. The characteristics of the daughter nuclei correlated with those of 256103, implying the assignment of the parent to 260105.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes started {{teaching}} piano {{when he was}} 19. He dropped out of studying at the University of Southern California in 1929 to support his family through the Great Depression by full-time teaching. As a teacher, he designed a method that combined classical and jazz music, which became popular across the United States, and resulted in an hour-long nationally syndicated radio show. Rhodes continued to teach the piano through his lifetime, and the piano method continues to be taught today by <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> Joseph Brandsetter.|$|E
5|$|Styx was {{discovered}} by <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> astronomer Mark R. Showalter, using fourteen sets of images taken between 26 June and 9 July 2012 by the Wide Field Camera 3 fitted to the Hubble Space Telescope. The discovery was announced on 11 July 2012. Styx is about half as bright as the dimmest previously known object in the system, Kerberos, and about one hundred thousandth as bright as Pluto. It was designated S/2012 (134340) 1, and informally referred to as P5.|$|E
5|$|The RaLa Experiment, or RaLa, was {{a series}} of tests during and after the Manhattan Project {{designed}} to study the behavior of converging shock waves to achieve the spherical implosion necessary for compression of the plutonium pit of the nuclear weapon. The experiment used significant amounts of a short-lived radioisotope lanthanum-140, a potent source of gamma radiation; the RaLa is a contraction of Radioactive Lanthanum. The method was proposed by Robert Serber and developed by <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> the Italian experimental physicist Bruno Rossi.|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} the {{planetary}} orbit allowed {{the mass of the}} white dwarf star to be estimated as well, and theories of the formation of the planet suggested that the white dwarf should be young and hot. On July 10, 2003, the detection of the white dwarf and confirmation of its predicted properties were announced by <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> Steinn Sigurdsson, using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. It was at a NASA press briefing that the name Methuselah was introduced, capturing press attention around the world.|$|E
5|$|Doomsday is a 2008 {{science fiction}} action horror film written and {{directed}} by Neil Marshall. The film takes place in the future in Scotland, which has been quarantined because of a deadly virus. When the virus is found in London, political leaders send <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) to Scotland to find a possible cure. Sinclair's team runs into two types of survivors: marauders and medieval knights. Doomsday was conceived by Marshall based on the idea of futuristic soldiers facing medieval knights. In producing the film, he drew inspiration from various movies, including Mad Max, Escape from New York and 28 Days Later.|$|E

5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are found}} in the west, north, and east of Madagascar, but their {{distribution}} is discontinuous. Their habitat ranges from dry deciduous forests on the western coast of the island to rainforest in the east. They are also commonly found in secondary forest, but not in areas lacking continuous forest cover. They are most common in the west of the island. Fork-marked lemurs are not found in the southern spiny forests in the dry southern part of the island, and only recently have been reported from the southeastern rainforest at Andohahela National Park, though this has not been confirmed. <b>A</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> E.E.Louis Jr. has suggested that undescribed varieties may also exist elsewhere on the island.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel initiates {{a second}} {{broadcast}} by showing a simulated {{explosion of the}} U.S. Capitol building, causing a public panic. Farrell guesses that his next target is likely the power grid, and the two drive to a utility superstation in West Virginia. They find <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> Mai taking over the station. McClane manages to kill all of them, including Mai. He obtains video footage of Gabriel which he relays to the FBI. Enraged over Mai's death, Gabriel seizes control of the natural gas distribution system and redirects all of the gas into the station. McClane and Farrell escape before the station explodes, leaving much of the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada without power.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 d was {{discovered}} by analysing changes in its star's radial velocity {{as a result of}} the planet's gravity. The radial velocity measurements were made by observing the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. At the time of discovery, Gliese 876 was known to host two extrasolar planets, designated Gliese 876 b and c, in a 2:1 orbital resonance. After the two planets were taken into account, the radial velocity still showed another period, at around two days. The planet, designated Gliese 876 d, was announced on June 13, 2005 by <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> Eugenio Rivera and was estimated to have a mass approximately 7.5 times that of Earth.|$|E
