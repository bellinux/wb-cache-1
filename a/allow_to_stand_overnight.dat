30|$|As ① {{is a basic}} salt (i.e., it {{contains}} a hydroxide anion) in opposite to the ‘neutral’ chalconatronite, one might assume that raising the pH might help to precipitate the basic compound. But by using a sodium hydrogencarbonate/carbonate buffer chalconatronite is definitely synthesized as Sengupta and Nandi report themselves [6] (see also [11 : 353] for a similar synthesis). At even higher pH, by using sodium carbonate (soda) alone, we yielded a totally amorphous product. Gettens and Frondel [12], the discoverer of the mineral chalconatronite, obtained ‘a pale blue-green precipitate closely similar to chalconatronite in chemical composition… and other properties…simply by grinding in a mortar copper acetate in a saturated solution of sodium carbonate, <b>allowing</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>overnight,</b> filtering, washing and drying.’ Erdös [13] grew chalconatronite on copper wetted with 10  % soda solution.|$|R
30|$|Jatropha oil {{extracted}} from Jatropha seed was transesterified to form Jatropha Methyl Ester (JME). In this method, {{a mixture of}} 300  g of Jatropha oil, 100  g methanol and 1 % wt/wt orthophosphoric acid catalyst were poured into continuously stirred reactor equipped with a water-cooled reflux condenser and heated up to 65  °C for 90  min. The mixture was dosed with 0.2 molar solution of sodium trioxocarbonate IV, which on neutralizing the acid catalyst, stopped the reaction. The neutralized mixture was later transferred to a separating funnel and subsequently <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>overnight</b> <b>to</b> ensure complete separation of methyl esters and glycerol phases. Glycerol phase (bottom phase) was emptied into a clean container and then <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand.</b> The obtained JME was heated at 65  °C to remove methanol. Entrained catalyst in the JME was removed by successive rinses with hot distilled water. Finally, water present in the JME was eliminated by oven-heating at 70  °C [34].|$|R

Four representative aliquots were sampled by halving and quartering prior to weighing. About 0.5  ±  0.05  g of each aliquot was weighed into a 100  mL beaker and 4  mL concentrated H 2 SO 4 was added followed by 1  mL concentrated HNO 3 and then placed in a water bath maintained at 58  °C until the tissue completely dissolved. The sample was then cooled to 4  °C in an ice bath and 5  mL of 5  % KMnO 4 in 1  mL increments was cautiously added. About 8  mL of 5  % K 2 S 2 O 8 was then added and <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>overnight</b> at room temperature.

Chloropicrin (100 g., 0. 61 mole) (Note 2) is placed in the dropping funnel, and the stirred solution is heated to 58 – 60 ° with a water bath. The chloropicrin is added at a rate of 30 – 35 drops per minute until the reaction becomes self-sustaining (about 20 minutes), at which point the water bath is removed and the balance of the chloropicrin is added at a rate sufficient to maintain the temperature at 58 – 60 ° (Note 3). When the addition, which requires nearly 2 hours, is complete, the stirrer is stopped and the mixture is <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>overnight...</b>|$|R
40|$|Two solvent mixtures: n-pentane/n-hexane and n-heptane/n-octane at ten {{different}} percentage ratios {{were used}} to dissolve 2. 5 g of vacuum distilled Anthan crude oil residue (500 ˚C). The crude oil/n-alkane mixture in different conical flasks was stoppered, shaked mechanically and <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>overnight.</b> The resultant solution was subsequently filtered using a vacuum pump to af-ford the different weights of the residue (asphaltenes). The result of the weights of asphaltenes obtained at the different ratios of solvent mixtures showed that the highest amount of precipitate was obtained at 100 % n-pentane solvent. Also there was {{a sharp increase in}} the amount of as-phaltenes precipitated when the percentage ratio of n-pentane to n-hexane precipitant was 40 : 60 and when the ratio of n-heptane to n-octane precipitant was 30 : 70. A good understanding of the contribution of the different n-alkane solvents in the precipitation of asphaltenes is very neces-sary to flow assurance of crude oils in terms of solid precipitation...|$|R
5000|$|Rust bluing was {{developed}} between {{hot and cold}} bluing processes. It was originally used by gunsmiths in the 19th century to blue firearms prior {{to the development of}} hot bluing processes. The process was to coat the gun parts in an acid solution, let the parts rust uniformly, then immerse the parts in boiling water to stabilize the rusting process by removing any remaining residue from the applied acid solution (often nitric acid and hydrochloric acid diluted in water). Then the rust was carded (scrubbed) off, using a carding brush or wheel. A carding brush is a wire brush with very soft, thin (usually about [...]002 thick) wires. This process is repeated until the desired depth of color is achieved or the metal simply will not color any further. This {{is one of the reasons}} rust and fume bluing tend to be more rust resistant than any other method. The parts are then oiled and <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>overnight.</b> This process leaves a deep blue/black finish.|$|R
30|$|Residual {{glycerol}} {{was estimated}} in REG- 80, REG-GB, and REG-FFA containing culture media by ion chromatography using a Dionex ICS- 3000 system {{fitted with a}} CarboPac PAI 4  ×  250  mm column, with 0.05  mmol/L H 2 SO 4 as the eluent, and a refractive index detector. Residual fatty acids in REG- 80, REG-GB, REG-FFA containing cultures were estimated by as gas chromatography (GC) analysis. Five (5) g of REG- 80, REG-GB, and REG-FFA were suspended in 5  mL water, mixed with 5  mL chloroform, and then mixed by vortexing. The mixture was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>overnight,</b> after which 1  mL of the chloroform layer (bottom layer) was removed by pipette and mixed with 2  mL methanol containing 15  % sulphuric acid and 1  mL chloroform containing 0.5  mg/mL heptadecanoic acid. The mixture was heated at 100  °C in screw-capped tube. After 5  h, 1  mL water was added and the mixture was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>overnight.</b> The lower layer containing fatty acid methyl esters was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7890 A) fitted with a flame ionization detector (FID) and DB- 23 capillary column (30  mCell growth measurement ×  320  ×  0.25  µm; Agilent, California, USA). Samples (1  µl) were injected (using a CTC auto sampler) into the FID with a split ratio at 1 : 10. Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.78  mL/min. The injector and oven temperatures were 260  °C. The ramping program for the oven was as follows: initial temperature of 60  °C for 4  min; followed by an increase from 60 to 250  °C, with incremental increases of 15  °C/min; followed by a final hold at 260  °C for 4  min. A Supelco 37 component FAME mix (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as standard for peak identification and calculation of response factors for different fatty acids. Fatty acid peaks were quantified by comparing the peak area of the internal standard (1  mg/mL benzoic acid), and corrected with its response factor. Total fatty acid content was achieved by adding the individual fatty acid concentration together. Ammonia nitrogen was measured using the Quikchem method 10 - 107 - 06 - 1 -I for determination of ammonia in wastewater by flow injection analysis (Lachat Instrument, Colorado, USA), and the measured concentrations were rounded-off and reported to 2 significant digits.|$|R

40|$|Two {{simple and}} {{straightforward}} analytical {{procedures for the}} screening of sediment samples are reported. They involve extraction with ethyl acetate or methanol and subsequent' analysis by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using large-volume injection (LVI) or solid-phase extraction (SPE). The latter, which was originally developed {{for the analysis of}} aqueous samples, can be used without any modification. In general, 10 ml of organic solvent were added to 2 g of sediment, and the mixture was shaken and <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>overnight.</b> The methanolic extracts were then diluted in water and subjected to preconcentration and analysis using on-line SPE-GCMS. The ethyl acetate extracts were injected directly into the GC using LVI. Both methods were used for the detection and identification of microcontaminants during a monitoring study of the river Nitra (Slovak Republic). They included polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), chlorofluorohydrocarbons, alkoxylated and alkylated phenols and benzothiazole derivatives. Semi-quantitative profiles of the contaminants were constructed and provisionally interpreted. The results indicate that SPE-GC-MS, and also LVI-GC-MS, have good potential for a rapid screening of sediment samples and the identification of microcontaminants. The analytical procedures pose no problems, and the on- line set-up is user-friendly. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The Central Laboratory {{has been}} delaying the mix design testing of 2 1 / 2 " X 4 " Marshall {{specimens}} for stability, {{until the next}} day after molding. For example, if the mixes are made and samples molded on Friday a man would have to come in and work on Saturday to test these specimens.

40|$|The {{movement}} of soil fumigants through plastic mulch films following soil fumigation {{is of interest}} because reducing film permeability may result in increased efficacy and reduced emissions. Low-density or high-density polyethylene films (LDPE or HDPE) were reported to be permeable to soil fumigants, while virtually impermeable films (VIF) were shown to greatly reduce {{movement of}} these fumigants (Papiernik and Yates 2001). Although VIF reduces permeability and improves efficacy of fumigants (Gilreath and Chellemi 1998, Noling et al. 2001), it has not met with widespread grower acceptance {{for a number of}} reasons, primarily higher cost and poor handling characteristics. As a result, there is still a need to identify films and/or coatings for polyethylene films that will reduce movement of fumigants, but will not be as costly or difficult to handle. The method reported here was developed as a quick, simple, and inexpensive way to detect differences in film permeability. The test chamber used is shown in Fig. 1.
