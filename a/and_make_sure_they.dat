Art therapists should continue therapy with a patient only if the client is benefiting from the therapy. It's against the principles established by the ATCB for art therapist to have patients only for financial reasons.|$|E

500|$|Marcus {{was born}} in The Cedars, Dallas, Texas, the son of Herbert Marcus, Sr., who later became a co-founder of the {{original}} Neiman-Marcus store with his sister Carrie and her husband, Al Neiman. Stanley {{was the first of}} four sons born to Herbert, Sr., and his wife, the former Minnie Lichtenstein. The pregnancy indirectly led to the eventual founding of Neiman-Marcus, as Herbert Sr. decided to leave Sanger's, where he was a buyer of boys' clothing, when he deemed his raise insufficient to support a family. Returning from two years spent in Atlanta, Georgia, establishing a successful sales-promotion business, the Marcuses and Neimans used the $25,000 made in the sale of that business to establish their store at the corner of Elm and Murphy. Given that the family's other option for the money was to invest in the then-unknown Coca-Cola Company, Marcus loved to say that Neiman-Marcus was established [...] "as a result of the bad judgment of its founders." [...] In his memoir, Marcus recalled his father as [...] "affectionate" [...] and his mother as even-handed in her attention to each of their children, making sure even into their adulthood to give them equivalent gifts <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> were praised equally.|$|E
