5|$|In December 2001, Jovanovski {{was chosen}} to Canada's Olympic team for the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City.

Canada {{went on to win}} the gold medal, 5–2. Jovanovski had three points, all assists, in total.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Enterprise {{is fired}} upon by a cloaked attacker, with each {{subsequent}} attack {{stronger than the}} last, straining the ship's shields. Chief Engineer Lt. Logan (Vyto Ruginis) goes to the bridge to demand that the Enterprise flee the planet and attempts to take command, as he outranks La Forge, but La Forge refuses, pointing out that Logan lacks the authority to remove him, and orders {{him to return to}} Engineering. As the attacks continue, La Forge recalls Logan to the bridge and orders <b>a</b> <b>saucer</b> separation, leaving Logan in charge of the saucer, and taking command of the star-drive section from the battle bridge himself to return to Minos.|$|E
50|$|Sunken kottabos (Κότταβος κατακτός) {{is not so}} simple.

5|$|When {{eccentric}} scientist Dr. Brackish Okun {{examines the}} alien captured by Steven, it regains consciousness and attacks. It telepathically invades Dr. Okun's mind and uses his vocal cords {{to communicate with}} Thomas before launching a psychic attack against him. Thomas sees visions of the aliens' plans: their entire civilization travels from planet to planet, exterminating all indigenous life and harvesting the planet of all natural resources. After Secret Service agents and military personnel kill the alien, Thomas reluctantly authorizes a nuclear attack; a B-2 Spirit fires a nuclear warhead tipped cruise missile at <b>a</b> <b>saucer</b> positioned above Houston, but the saucer remains intact.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, David {{demonstrates}} {{that the key to}} defeating the aliens lies in deactivating their force fields, and devises a way to do so by uploading a computer virus into the mothership. He proposes using the refurbished alien fighter to implement the plan, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The two are able to upload the virus and deploy a nuclear weapon on board the mothership. With military pilots in short supply, Thomas enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, and leads an attack on <b>a</b> <b>saucer</b> bearing down on Area 51. With the aliens' shields deactivated, the fighters are able to inflict damage, but their supply of missiles is quickly exhausted. As the saucer prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but his attempt of firing it jams, leaving him no choice but to sacrifice his own life. He flies his plane kamikaze-style into the directed-energy weapon port, which results in an explosion that destroys the saucer. Human resistance forces around the world successfully destroy the other saucers using this vulnerability. As humankind is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They and military officers nearby accompany Thomas and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the mothership burn up, resembling a fireworks display as it enters Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} other little tactics used {{in the game of}} hockey. Cycling moves the puck along the boards in the {{offensive}} zone to create a scoring chance by making defenders tired or moving them out of position. Pinching is when a defenceman pressures the opposition's winger in the offensive zone when they are breaking out, attempting to stop their attack and keep the puck in the offensive zone. <b>A</b> <b>saucer</b> pass is a pass used when an opposition's stick or body is in the passing lane. It is the act of raising the puck over the obstruction and having it land on a teammate's stick.|$|E
25|$|The Showcase Lagoon grandstands were {{constructed}} and stunt ski performances began in 1979. These shows included formation skiing {{as well as}} high speed jumps off a large ramp. Guests standing near the front rows of the grandstand were often splashed by {{the wake of the}} ski boat as it made high speed turns around the small lagoon. At this point in time, the Showcase Lagoon and the east lagoon (also referred to as Oriental Lagoon) were still one large body of water. The ski boat would often use the east lagoon for turning around after a run. A clown skiing on a round piece of plywood (called <b>a</b> <b>saucer)</b> while entertaining the crowd was also part of the show.|$|E

25|$|All of {{the methods}} used in pre-Hispanic times, along with the potter's wheel, are still used to make pieces. Coiling is usually limited to {{finishing}} a piece that has first been pressed into a mold. Molding {{is the most common}} way of forming enclosed vessels. Most of these molds are concave or convex, with the clay pressed against the inside or outside of the mold. Sometimes liquid clay is poured into plaster molds. Potters wheels are most commonly used in some workshops, and often to rapidly make a succession of small vessels. Their use is more common in Guanajuato and Jalisco than other parts of the country. In many places, the wheel is powered by foot, using a kickwheel, rather than by electricity. Hand turned wheels are also used. In Oaxaca, a type of proto-wheel has been used by the Zapotecs since pre-Hispanic times. This is <b>a</b> <b>saucer</b> balanced over an inverted saucer that is turned to help shape the piece. It is most often used for the barro negro pottery made in San Bartolo Coyotepec.|$|E
500|$|The {{memorial}} {{building is}} a circular granite structure surrounded by sixteen granite fluted Greek Doric columns in a peripteral colonnade, capped with <b>a</b> <b>saucer</b> dome of glass panels and resting on a stylobate.

[...] Except for the maintenance rooms, these feature plastered walls and ceilings, marble wainscoting, and terrazzo flooring. [...] Visitors enter the memorial by climbing thirty granite steps in the northwest corner. The basement is unfinished, with fluorescent lighting revealing a ceiling and walls of exposed concrete, and a dirt floor.|$|E
500|$|Breeding {{pairs of}} black {{honeyeaters}} nest in groups or loose colonies, with males aggressively defending a small breeding territory against {{members of their}} own species as well as other honeyeaters. [...] Both members of the pair seem to be involved in selecting the nest site. The nest is usually situated low on a dead limb or in a fork of a small tree or shrub, though sometimes fallen timber including a fallen Callitris pine is chosen as the nest site. The female gathers nesting material close to the nest site, while the male is engaged in song flights, and she builds the shallow, open, cup-shaped nest from fine twigs, grass, and other plant material bound with spiderweb, lining it with grass, roots, fibre, horse hair, flowers or wool. As the young grow the nest can become flattened to <b>a</b> <b>saucer</b> shape, and may be an almost flat platform by the time the chicks fledge.|$|E
