By 1978, 162 cars had been delivered to Oslo Sporveier. These were manufactured in four series, named T1 through T4, with varying specifications. T1 was manufactured in 90 units from 1964 to 1966 {{for the opening}} of the Grorud Line and the conversion of the Lambertseter Line. The first 30 have driver's cabs in both directions (designated T1-2), while the latter 60 have it in only one end (designated T1-1). In 1967, 15 T2s were built for the conversion of the Østensjø Line. Although given a new designation, they are in <b>all</b> <b>ways</b> identical to the T1-1s. From 1969 to 1972, 30 T3s were built for the Furuset Line. Further expansions of the lines resulted in 37 T4s being built from 1976 to 1978. The T1000s are numbered 1001–1162.|$|E

25|$|To {{those who}} believe that {{consciousness}} entails something more than behaving in <b>all</b> <b>ways</b> conscious, Dennett's view is seen as eliminativist, since it denies the existence of qualia and the possibility of philosophical zombies. However, Dennett is not denying the existence of the mind or of consciousness, only what he considers a naive view of them. The point of contention is whether Dennett's own definitions are indeed more accurate, whether what we think of when we speak of perceptions and consciousness can be understood in terms of nothing more than their effect on behaviour.|$|E

25|$|Over {{one hundred}} and twenty five {{communities}} donated their time {{to work at the}} canteen. Some people travelled as far as two hundred miles to take turns on regularly appointed days. The groups also took responsibility in supplying food for the day. If a group was too small, multiple ones would band together and help fulfill the daily requirements. Benefit dances, pie socials, and other activities were held to also help raise money for the canteen. Even the youth contributed to the workload, cleaning floors and raising money in <b>all</b> <b>ways</b> possible to support the troops. One girl remembers writing their addresses onto the packaging of popcorn balls so that the troops would have someone to write to. One twelve-year-old boy even sold his pets, toys, and the shirt off his back and donated the money to the cause. Even the railroad got into the giving by donating a dishwasher and coffee urns.|$|E

The sage Uddālaka stays with his wife in a Gurukula with 10,000 disciples. The couple have a daughter, Sujātā, who grows up learning the Vedas with the disciples. Uddālaka has a famous disciple by the name Kahola. At the end of his education, Kahola is requested by Uddālaka to marry a Brāhmaṇa woman who is suitable for him in <b>all</b> <b>ways</b> and enter Gārhasthya Āśrama. Kahola thinks of Sujātā but is hesitant as he is not certain if marrying the daughter of his Guru would be appropriate. Uddālaka comes to know of Kahola's disposition, and happily offers Sujātā in marriage to Kahola. Uddālaka also prophesises that Sujātā will bear him a son who will be become a source of inspiration for the disabled. Kahola and Sujātā get married and choose a desolate forest for their Āśrama, where Kahola starts teaching disciples.

500|$|In February and March Nansen {{published}} {{a series of}} newspaper articles which placed him firmly in the separatist camp. The new prime minister wanted Nansen in the cabinet, but Nansen had no political ambitions. However, at Michelsen's request he went to Berlin and then to London where, {{in a letter to}} The Times, he presented Norway's legal case for a separate consular service to the English-speaking world. On 17 May 1905, Norway's Constitution Day, Nansen addressed a large crowd in Christiania, saying: [...] "Now have <b>all</b> <b>ways</b> of retreat been closed. Now remains only one path, the way forward, perhaps through difficulties and hardships, but forward for our country, to a free Norway". He also wrote a book, Norway and the Union with Sweden, specifically to promote Norway's case abroad.|$|E
500|$|According to Manolescu, {{these stories}} were largely {{outdated}} {{by the time}} of their publishing, when more experimental work was being put out by Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu and Camil Petrescu; Agârbiceanu [...] "could only strike the figure of a naive moralist, reeking of a parson's mindset, in <b>all</b> <b>ways</b> incompatible with the emancipated Romanian society of the interwar." [...] The novella Fefeleaga, however, is largely seen as Agârbiceanu's true masterpiece—either his best story or one of two, alongside the short story Luminița. At the center of the story is a woman who makes a meager living quarrying stones for gold panning, with her many children killed off by a respiratory disease. She was based on a real-life Moț, Sofia Danciu, with only some details changed. In the defining moment of the narrative, seen by Dragomirescu as symbolic for the plight of Romanian Transylvanians, Fefeleaga sells off her emaciated draft horse and only friend, to prepare for her daughter's funeral. However, as Iorga notes, this is not a pessimistic outcome: [...] "kindness is present, but hidden, in this world, but will reveal itself in the hours of pity and those of justice". Luminița shows the final moments in a woman's life, and her inability to grant herself one last wish, and, according to Dragomirescu, is a [...] "universal" [...] work, worthy of a Count Tolstoy.|$|E

2500|$|According to an {{argument}} {{put forth by}} Saul Kripke in his paper [...] "Identity and Necessity" [...] (1971), one key consequence of the claim that such things as raw feels can be meaningfully discussed—that qualia exist—is that it leads to the logical possibility of two entities exhibiting identical behavior in <b>all</b> <b>ways</b> despite one of them entirely lacking qualia.
