An unprecedented step, the scholarship should further the cause of freedom of thought and the exchange of ideas in academia. The scholarship is named in honor of Bonnie Burstow, a faculty member at the University of Toronto, a radical feminist, and an <b>antipsychiatry</b> activist.

50|$|The biopsychiatry {{controversy}} is {{a dispute over}} which viewpoint should predominate and form the scientific basis of psychiatric theory and practice.

50|$|An <b>antipsychiatry</b> {{movement}} came to {{the fore}} in the 1960s. Deinstitutionalization gradually occurred in the West, with isolated psychiatric hospitals being closed down in favor of community mental health services. However, inadequate services and continued social exclusion often led to many being homeless or in prison. A consumer/survivor movement gained momentum.|$|E
50|$|In May 1968, a {{group of}} about five hundred revolutionary student {{followers}} of Leon Trotsky professing <b>antipsychiatry</b> attacked his offices.

50|$|Many of {{the members}} of MFI, who feel that their human rights were {{violated}} by the mental health system, refer to themselves as 'psychiatric survivors'. MFI is a contemporary and active coalition of grassroots groups which are carrying forward the historical tradition of survivor opposition to coercive psychiatry. It does not define itself as an <b>antipsychiatry</b> organization and its members point to the role which 'compassionate' psychiatrists have played in MFI. Activists within the coalition have been drawn from both left and right wing of politics.|$|E
50|$|Mannoni {{specialised}} {{in mental}} illness in children, and in 1969 established {{the school of}} Bonneuil-sur-Marne, a community live-in project for children with autism and psychosis. In doing so, she {{has been described as}} “profoundly influenced by the <b>antipsychiatry</b> of R. D. Laing and D. Cooper”, an influence which can also be seen perhaps in her view of the child as the dysfunctional family's spokesperson. Until it was reformed as a day hospital in 1975, Bonneuil would be a leading institutional influence, known for its wide variety of therapeutic methods and its disregard for traditional boundaries.|$|E
5000|$|Henry Nasrallah {{claims that}} while he {{believes}} anti-psychiatry consists of many historical exaggerations based on events and primitive conditions from a century ago, [...] "antipsychiatry helps keep us honest and rigorous about what we do, motivating us to relentlessly seek better diagnostic models and treatment paradigms. Psychiatry is far more scientific {{today than it was}} a century ago, but misperceptions about psychiatry continue to be driven by abuses of the past. The best antidote for <b>antipsychiatry</b> allegations is a combination of personal integrity, scientific progress, and sound evidence-based clinical care".|$|E
50|$|Anti-psychiatry {{as practiced}} by Laing and Cooper, that is, anti-psychiatry as an {{approach}} to psychiatry, or as a school of psychoanalysis, might today be better subsumed under the category Critical Psychiatry. Anti-psychiatry itself however, that is, the prefix anti attached to the word psychiatry, and meaning a movement against, or in opposition to, the field of psychiatry itself {{is still very much}} alive and kicking, and it is certainly no throwback to the sixties. Anti-psychiatry activists today include psychiatric survivors and dissident professionals who are not afraid to oppose the practice of psychiatry, with its cozy relationship to the pharmaceutical industry, and its monitoring function on behalf of government, and who envision an end to the field of psychiatry itself, or, at the very least, an end to harmful and coercive psychiatric practices. The thing these activists call for, rather than an endless cycle of reforms, some more repressive, some less, is the complete and total abolition of forced psychiatric treatment. Today, although mostly a movement of activists with centers notably in Toronto, New York, and London, <b>antipsychiatry</b> is returning to academia as a field of study and critique. This is exemplified at OISE, the University of Toronto, with the recent endowment of the Bonnie Burstow <b>Antipsychiatry</b> Scholarship for students engaging in Masters and PhD level research.|$|E
5000|$|Coming to {{the fore}} in the 1960s, an anti-psychiatry {{movement}} challenged the fundamental claims and practices of mainstream psychiatry. The ex-patient movement of this time contributed to, and derived much from, <b>antipsychiatry</b> ideology, but has also been described as having its own agenda, described as humanistic socialism. For a time, the movement shared aims and practices with [...] "radical therapists", who tended to be Marxist. However, the consumer/survivor/ex-patients gradually felt that the radical therapists did not necessarily share the same goals and were taking over, and they broke away from {{them in order to}} maintain independence.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, Peter Lehmann {{was awarded}} an honorary {{doctorate}} in acknowledgment of [...] "exceptional scientific and humanitarian {{contribution to the}} rights of the people with psychiatric experience" [...] by the School of Psychology of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, Philosophical Faculty. Kostas Bairaktaris, Prof. of Clinical Psychology, gave the speech in Peter Lehmann's honor. Lehmann is the first survivor of psychiatry in the world to be honored with an honorary degree for pioneering achievements within the realm of humanistic <b>antipsychiatry.</b> In 2011, he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in acknowledgement of service to the community by the President of Germany.|$|E
5000|$|A 1986 {{report on}} {{developments}} in the United States noted that [...] "there are now three national organizations ... The ‘conservatives’ have created the National Mental Health Consumers' Association ... The ‘moderates’ have formed the National Alliance of Mental Patients ... The ‘radical’ group is called the Network to Abolish Psychiatry". Many, however, {{felt that they had}} survived the psychiatric system and its [...] "treatments" [...] and resented being called consumers. The National Association of Mental Patients in the United States became the National Association of Psychiatric Survivors. [...] "Phoenix Rising: The Voice of the Psychiatrized" [...] was published by ex-inmates (of psychiatric hospitals) in Toronto from 1980 to 1990, known across Canada for its <b>antipsychiatry</b> stance.|$|E
5000|$|Although the Retreat {{had been}} based on a non-medical {{approach}} and environment, medically based reformers emulating it spoke of [...] "patients" [...] and [...] "hospitals". Asylum [...] "nurses" [...] and attendants, once valued as a core part of providing good holistic care, were often scapegoated for {{the failures of the}} system. Towards the end of the 19th century, somatic theories, pessimism in prognosis, and custodialism had returned. Theories of hereditary degeneracy and eugenics took over, and in the 20th century the concepts of mental hygiene and mental health developed. From the mid 20th century, however, a process of <b>antipsychiatry</b> and deinstitutionalization occurred in many countries in the West, and asylums in many areas were gradually replaced with more local community mental health services.|$|E
5000|$|Well-positioned {{forces in}} the USA, led by figures such as psychiatrists E. Fuller Torrey and Sally Satel, and some leaders of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, have lobbied against the funding of consumer/survivor groups that promote <b>antipsychiatry</b> views or promote social and experiential {{recovery}} rather than a biomedical model, or who protest against outpatient commitment. Torrey has said the term [...] "psychiatric survivor" [...] used by ex-patients to describe themselves is just political correctness and has blamed them, along with civil rights lawyers, {{for the deaths of}} half a million people due to suicides and deaths on the street. His accusations have been described as inflammatory and completely unsubstantiated, however, and issues of self-determination and self-identity said to be more complex than that.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a common}} theme, here, {{with the work of}} David Ingleby whose chapter in Critical Psychiatry: The Politics of Mental Health sets out a {{detailed}} critique of positivism (the view that epistemology, or knowledge about the world is best served by empiricism and the scientific method rather than metaphysics). A common theme running through Laingian <b>antipsychiatry,</b> Ingleby’s critical psychiatry, contemporary critical psychiatry and postpsychiatry is the view that social, political and cultural realities {{play a vital role in}} helping us to understand the suffering and experience of madness. Like Laing, Ingleby stressed the importance of hermeneutics and interpretation in inquiries about the meaning of experience in psychiatry, and (like Laing) he drew on psychoanalysis as an interpretative aid, but his work was also heavily influenced by the critical theory of the Frankfurt School.|$|E
5000|$|Somatherapy (or Soma) {{was created}} by the Freire in the 1970s as a group therapy, based on the {{research}} of the psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich. [...] With the objective of freeing the individual to be more creative, the exercises in Soma work with the relationship between the body and emotions. Other essential ingredients in Soma are the studies of <b>Antipsychiatry</b> related to human communication and the Brazilian martial art / dance Capoeira Angola. [...] Soma groups last a year and a half, with frequent sessions, including usually one full weekend per month for the entire group, as well as frequent capoeira classes, study sessions, social activities, and two self-organized group trips. These times together allow the participants to build and develop the group dynamic, in line with the principles of Anarchism.|$|E
5000|$|She participated {{with the}} real time theatre in public space [...] "The Beggar's Opera" [...] in Münster Sculpture Projects 2007, where the {{character}} Charles Filch made his first appearance in her work. She has {{always been interested in}} anti-heroic and marginal personas as a prototype to study the social status of the artist, and in narratives of resistance and counterculture. In this regard, Dora García has developed works on the DDR political police, the Stasi ("Rooms, Conversations", film, 24 ', 2006), on the charismatic figure of US stand up comedian Lenny Bruce ("Just because everything is different {{it does not mean that}} anything has changed, Lenny Bruce in Sydney", one-time performance, Sydney Biennale, 2008) or on the origins, rhizomatic associations and consequences of <b>antipsychiatry</b> ("Mad Marginal" [...] book series since 2010, [...] "The Deviant Majority", film, 34', 2010).|$|E
5000|$|Sechehaye {{followed}} {{the work of}} Sigmund Freud and Jean Piaget closely, believing there was a link between psychosis and trauma experienced as a child. One of her most notable cases was undertaken with a psychotic patient referred to as [...] "Renée", a pseudonym used for Louisa Düss who the Sechehayes eventually adopted. Over {{the course of their}} work together, Sechehaye took the unique approach of chronicling Düss' journal entries and personal reflections in tandem with her own clinical commentary. The approach significantly influenced mental illness research by introducing an <b>antipsychiatry</b> framework that positioned the patient's experiences as a valid means of establishing their case histories. As a result of this work, the book [...] "Autobiography of a Schizophrenic Girl: The True Story of [...] "Renee" [...] was published highlighting the most memorable aspects of the disease.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s, a {{tendency}} was noted among psychiatrists to characterize and {{to regard the}} anti-psychiatric movement {{as part of the}} past, and to view its ideological history as flirtation with the polemics of radical politics at the expense of scientific thought and enquiry. It was also argued, however, that the movement contributed towards generating demand for grassroots involvement in guidelines and advocacy groups, and to the shift from large mental institutions to community services. Additionally, community centers have tended in practice to distance themselves from the psychiatric/medical model and have continued to see themselves as representing a culture of resistance or opposition to psychiatry's authority. Overall, while <b>antipsychiatry</b> as a movement may have become an anachronism by this period and was no longer led by eminent psychiatrists, {{it has been argued that}} it became incorporated into the mainstream practice of mental health disciplines. On the other hand, mainstream psychiatry became more biomedical, increasing the gap between professionals.|$|E
50|$|Dorothy Weiner {{and about}} 10 others, {{including}} Tom Wittick, established the Insane Liberation Front {{in the spring}} of 1970 in Portland, Oregon. Though it only lasted 6 months, it had a notable influence in the history of North American ex-patients groups. News that former inmates of mental institutions were organizing was carried to other parts of North America. Individuals such as Howard Geld, known as Howie the Harp for his harmonica playing, left Portland where he been involved in ILF to return to his native New York to help found the Mental Patients Liberation Project in 1971. During the early 1970s, groups spread to California, New York, and Boston, which were primarily <b>antipsychiatry,</b> opposed to forced treatment including forced drugging, shock treatment and involuntary committal. In 1972, the first organized group in Canada, the Mental Patients Association, started to publish In A Nutshell, while in the US the first edition of the first national publication by ex-mental patients, Madness Network News, was published in Oakland, continuing until 1986.|$|E
50|$|The {{psychiatric}} survivors movement arose out of {{the civil}} rights ferment of the late 1960s and early 1970s and the personal histories of psychiatric abuse experienced by some ex-patients rather than the intradisciplinary discourse of <b>antipsychiatry.</b> The key text in the intellectual development of the survivor movement, at least in the USA, was Judi Chamberlin's 1978 text, On Our Own: Patient Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System. Chamberlin was an ex-patient and co-founder of the Mental Patients' Liberation Front. Coalescing around the ex-patient newsletter Dendron, in late 1988 leaders from several of the main national and grassroots psychiatric survivor groups felt that an independent, human rights coalition focused on problems in the mental health system was needed. That year the Support Coalition International (SCI) was formed. SCI's first public action was to stage a counter-conference and protest in New York City, in May, 1990, {{at the same time as}} (and directly outside of) the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting. In 2005 the SCI changed its name to Mind Freedom International with David W. Oaks as its director.|$|E

Since the Congress in Honolulu in 1978, he has inspired the movement {{against the use}} of psychiatry for political ends. The organization campaigned against the political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union by leading efforts within national and international psychiatric organizations to eradicate this systematic abuse. The IAPUP had no connection with any political group nor with <b>antipsychiatry.</b> The organization brought together and coordinated independent groups dedicated to the struggle against political abuse of psychiatry and composed of psychiatrists and human rights activists from Canada, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and West Germany. During its first two decades IAPUP, investigated the accusations of oppressive exploitation in a number of countries such as Argentina, Bulgaria, Chile, Czechoslovakia, Cuba, Eastern Germany, Hungary, Romania, South Africa, the Netherlands, and Yugoslavia. The publication of the IAPUP was Information Bulletin. The IAPUP included the following participating committees: ...|$|E

5000|$|In the 1960s, Michel Foucault renewed the {{argument}} that moral treatment had really been {{a new form of}} moral oppression, replacing physical oppression, and his arguments were widely adopted within the <b>antipsychiatry</b> movement. Foucault was interested in ideas of [...] "the other" [...] and how society defines normalcy by defining the [...] and its relationship to the normal. A patient in the asylum had to go through four moral syntheses: silence, recognition in the mirror, perpetual judgment, and the apotheosis of the medical personage. The mad were ignored and verbally isolated. They were made to see madness in others and then in themselves until they felt guilt and remorse. The doctor, despite his lack of medical knowledge about the underlying processes, had all powers of authority and defined insanity. Thus Foucault argues that the [...] "moral" [...] asylum is [...] "not a free realm of observation, diagnosis, and therapeutics; it is a juridical space where one is accused, judged, and condemned." [...] Foucault's reassessment was succeeded by a more balanced view, recognizing that the manipulation and ambiguous [...] "kindness" [...] of Tuke and Pinel may have been preferable to the harsh coercion and physical [...] "treatments" [...] of previous generations, while aware of moral treatment's less benevolent aspects and its potential to deteriorate into repression.|$|E
5000|$|One {{evolutionary}} {{argument against}} psychology and psychiatry {{is from the}} study of swarm intelligence. There is evidence that since the same number of individuals with certain characteristics is enough to carry out the same function in the swarm regardless {{of the size of the}} swarm, the ideal percentage of [...] "special" [...] individuals decreases with increased group size. Therefore, global stabilizing selection maintaining the same percentage of psychiatric conditions in all human populations is not possible, given the differences in group size that already existed based on food availability across climates in the Paleolithic and became even greater upon the invention of agriculture. If a condition was only present in 1% of humans, which is what psychiatry claims to be a culturally universal figure for multiple diagnoses including schizophrenia and psychopathy, small Stone Age bands would at any given time be at a significant risk of not having a single member with any given 1% condition. If at least one member with each 1% diagnosis was essential for any group's survival, random chance would in few generations have ensured human extinction in the Paleolithic. What behaviors are necessary for a group's survival also varies depending on the group's lifestyle, ensuring a divergence-enhancing weak niche construction as opposed to the divergence-hampering strong niche construction believed in by psychiatry. Advocates of this evolutionary <b>antipsychiatry</b> tend not to sympathize with the Church of Scientology but instead point at similarities between psychiatry and scientology, such as both arbitrarily and often moralizingly deciding what they consider normal or pathological, scientology's belief in retained body thetans after going clear resembling psychiatry's belief in sane people also having human flaws, both claiming to have the only cure, both demanding significant amounts of money for their treatment, both having very accommodative claims that are extremely difficult to impossible to test scientifically, both sometimes resorting to coercive treatment, scientology's use of fists and buckets of cold water doing similar harm as psychiatry's use of drugs and electroconvulsive therapy, and both explaining human behavior today with self-inconsistent and archaeologically invalid stories about human pre-history.|$|E
