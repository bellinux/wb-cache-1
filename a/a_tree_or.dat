5|$|In {{the early}} days the sheep were not shorn, but the wool was {{collected}} when the sheep moulted in the summer, either by plucking it from their fleece or collecting it {{where it had been}} rubbed off on <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> rock.|$|E
5|$|Males exhibit {{pronounced}} marking behaviourterritories, termite mounds, trees, common tracks, and junctions {{are marked}} by urine, faeces, and claw scratches. Males marking their territory by urination stand less than a metre away from <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> rock surface with the tail raised, pointing the penis either horizontally backward or 60° upward. Territorial clashes can take place between two coalitions, or coalitions and solitary males; fights, however, are rarely gruesome. Another major reason for fights is to acquire dominance in the breeding season. These can even involve cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|Using a fence, branch or {{telegraph}} pole as a perch or {{vantage point}} to hunt from, the southern boobook pounces on prey then retreats to <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> elevated place to eat it. It often hunts in open areas near trees, and also where prey {{are likely to}} congregate, such as mice near haystacks or barns, or flying insects near street- or house-lights.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the European or American robins but {{appear to be an}} early offshoot of the Passerida group of songbirds. The flame robin is predominantly insectivorous, pouncing on prey from a perch in <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> <b>or</b> foraging on the ground. A territorial bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by BirdLife International as Near Threatened, the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} open woodland and transitional zones. It has adapted well to urban environments {{and is a}} common city bird in Sydney, Canberra and Perth. An omnivorous and opportunistic feeder, it eats {{a wide variety of}} plant and animal material, as well as food waste from urban areas. In eastern Australia its range is strongly correlated with the presence of sheep, and it has been blamed for killing lambs. However, this is very rare, and the raven most often scavenges for afterbirth and stillborn animals as well as newborn lamb faeces. The Australian raven is territorial, with pairs generally bonding for life. Breeding takes place between July and September, with almost no variation across its range. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure of sticks sited high in <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> <b>or</b> occasionally in a man-made structure such as a windmill or other building.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} a poem written upon <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> <b>or</b> on bark, is found in several earlier {{pastoral}} poems – some critics have argued that such reference to writing {{is a reflection of}} self-conscious literary belatedness.|$|E

25|$|The English term cross {{derives from}} the Latin word crux. The Latin term crux classically {{referred}} to <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> any construction of wood used to hang criminals {{as a form of}} execution. The term later came to refer specifically to a cross.|$|E
25|$|The nest {{is a huge}} edifice {{of sticks}} in <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> on a coastal cliff. Being {{faithful}} to their territories, once they breed, nests are often reused, sometimes for decades by successive generations of birds; one nest in Iceland has been in use for over 150 years. In Scandinavia, trees {{have been known to}} collapse under the weight of enormous, long-established nests.|$|E
25|$|Their {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} prairie and dry grasslands in western North America. They build a stick nest in <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> shrub or on a cliff edge. This species is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Argentina; {{it has been}} recorded as a vagrant in neighboring Chile, in the island countries of the Dominican Republic, and Trinidad and Tobago, and in Norway.|$|E

25|$|These {{are fairly}} {{terrestrial}} birds of wet forest floors. They eat snails, insects and similar invertebrate prey. Pittas are mostly solitary and lay {{up to six}} eggs in a large spherical nest in <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> shrub, or sometimes on the ground. Both parents care for the young. Many species of pittas are migratory, and they often end up in unexpected places like house-gardens during migration.|$|E
25|$|Trogons {{excavate}} {{their nests}} by chewing cavities into very soft dead wood; some species make completely enclosed chambers (accessed by upward-slanting entrance tunnels), while others—like the extravagantly plumed resplendent quetzal—construct more open niches. In most trogon species, both sexes help with nest construction. The process may take several months, {{and a single}} pair may start several excavations before finding <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> stump with wood of the right consistency.|$|E
25|$|The mating {{habits of}} Limax maximus are {{considered}} unusual among slugs: the hermaphrodite slugs court, usually for hours, by circling and licking each other. After this, the slugs will climb into <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> other high area and then, entwined together, lower {{themselves on a}} thick string of mucus, evert their white translucent mating organs (penises) from their gonopores (openings {{on the right side}} of the head), entwine these organs, and exchange sperm. Both participants will later lay hundreds of eggs.|$|E

25|$|The {{custom of}} {{transferring}} disease or sickness from men to trees is well known. Sometimes the hair, nails, clothing, etc. of a sickly person are fixed to <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> <b>or</b> they are forcibly inserted {{in a hole}} in the trunk, or the tree is split and the patient passes through the aperture. Where the tree has been thus injured, its recovery and that of the patient are often associated. Different explanations may be found of such customs which naturally take rather different forms among peoples in different grades.|$|E
25|$|The divinatory {{meanings}} {{are usually}} {{based on the}} tree ogham, rather than the kennings of the Bríatharogam. Each letter is associated with <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> other plant, and meanings are derived from them. Robert Graves' book The White Goddess {{has been a major}} influence on assigning divinatory meanings for ogham. Some reconstructionists of Druidic ways use Briatharogam kennings as a basis for divinatory meanings in ogham divination. The three sets of kennings can be separated into Past-Present-Future or Land-Sea-Sky groupings in such systems, but other organising structures are used, as well.|$|E
25|$|The most typical form {{which the}} Jesse Tree takes {{is to show}} the figure of Jesse, often larger than all the rest, {{reclining}} or sleeping (perhaps by analogy to Adam when his rib was taken) {{at the foot of}} the pictorial space. From his side or his navel springs the trunk of <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> vine which ascends, branching to either side. On the branches, usually surrounded by formally scrolling tendrils of foliage, are figures representing the ancestors of Christ. The trunk generally ascends vertically to Mary and then Christ at the top.|$|E

25|$|Male cheetahs {{mark their}} {{territory}} by urinating on objects that stand out, such as trees, logs, or termite mounds. The whole coalition {{contributes to the}} scent. Males will attempt to kill any intruders, and fights result in serious injury or death. When male cheetahs urine-mark their territories, they stand a meter away from <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> rock surface with the tail raised, pointing the penis either horizontally backward or 60° upward. The odor of cheetah urine (unlike that of other large felids) cannot be easily detected by humans.|$|E
25|$|During World War I, {{there were}} {{persistent}} rumors that German soldiers had crucified a Canadian soldier on <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> barn door with bayonets or combat knives. The event was initially reported in 1915 by Private George Barrie of the 1st Canadian Division. Two investigations, one a post-war official investigation, {{and the other}} an independent investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, {{concluded that there was}} no evidence to support the story. However, British documentary maker Iain Overton in 2001 published an article claiming that the story was true, identifying the soldier as Harry Band. Overton's article was the basis for a 2002 episode of the Channel 4 documentary show Secret History.|$|E
25|$|Territorial {{males of}} this species perch upon {{prominent}} vegetation at high elevation (1500m or higher) and chase intruders away. There is never more than one individual in each territory {{for more than a}} few minutes. Every so often, the landowning male wasp will make short regular flights out from its perch. Intruding visitors are common among this species, as males jockey for the best territory. On occasion, the intruder engages in aerial combat with the territory owner over possession of the perch, <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>or</b> bush. The two males will clash wings and spiral vertically upwards engaging in an aerial contest for the territory.|$|E
