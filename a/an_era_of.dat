5|$|On February 17, 1944, Zoldak {{was traded}} along with Barney Lutz to the St. Louis Browns for Frankie Hayes, as the Athletics wanted a veteran {{to add to}} their roster, while the Browns wanted the two {{prospects}} as they were classified as 4-F, and {{would be available to}} the team {{for the duration of the}} war. He impressed the Browns coaching staff in spring training, and as a result was named to the opening day roster. Zoldak made his major league debut on May 13, and was used as a reliever during his first season, pitching in 18 games and earning <b>an</b> <b>ERA</b> <b>of</b> 3.72.

5|$|The 2009 season {{seemed to}} mark a rebound in Zito's {{pitching}} performance.

His ERA would have been 3.74 {{had it not been}} for his first two starts. Though going only 10–13 in the season, Zito's record was much more the fault of his spotty run support (the second-lowest in the major leagues) than his performance on the mound. On June 21, Zito pitched a no-hitter through six innings against Texas before giving up a home run to Andruw Jones in the seventh inning. He won the game, his fourth win of the season. On July 7, Zito pitched what could be considered his best game of the season. He pitched 8⅓ innings against the Florida Marlins, allowing one run on four hits, striking out six, and walking one. He won the game, his fifth win of the season.|$|E
