30|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{the effect of a}} third body on the apsidal motion of two bodies. The {{specific}} case involves a third body-planet Jupiter and the <b>apsidal</b> <b>line</b> motion of a minor planet that orbits the Sun and has its <b>apsidal</b> <b>line</b> go through the major axis of an ellipse. The third body (Jupiter) which satisfies the Langrangian solution will affect the <b>apsidal</b> <b>line</b> motion and therefore affects the ascending and descending motions of the minor planet. In this case no analytical solutions can be obtained, and therefore specific assumptions are made along with numerical solutions. For convenience, we adopt the Lagrangian solution in the three-body problem and obtain quasi-analytical results, which are used to evaluate the effect of the planet on the dΩ/dt (Ω ascending node) of each minor planet. This method is beneficial for improving our knowledge of the orbital elements of the asteroids, and perhaps even much smaller effects such as the effects of the planets on the interplanetary dust complex. Information on the latter may be provided by using this method to investigate Jupiter’s effect on the inclination of the symmetry surface of the zodiacal dust cloud.|$|E

The orbital design is further complicated by the addition of a high-energy parking orbit for the relatively massive Deep Space Vehicle to reduce propellant expenditure, while the crew transfers to and from the target orbit in a smaller Space Exploration Vehicle. The proposed strategy shifts the arrival and departure maneuvers away from periapsis so that the <b>apsidal</b> <b>line</b> of the parking orbit lies in {{the plane of the}} target orbit, permitting highly efficient plane change maneuvers at apoapsis of the elliptical parking orbit.

At small inclinations of the binary orbit to the line of sight, the streams of matter and the density waves excited in the circumbinary disk can screen the primary component of the binary from the observer. To study these phenomena, we have computed grids of hydrodynamic models for binary systems by the SPH method based on which we have constructed the phase light curves {{as a function of the}} rotation angle of the <b>apsidal</b> <b>line</b> relative to the observer. The model parameters were varied within the following ranges: the component mass ratio q = 0. 01 - 0. 1 and the eccentricity e = 0 - 0. 5. We adopted optical grain characteristics typical of circumstellar dust. Our computations have shown that the brightness oscillations with orbital phase can have a complex structure. The amplitudes and shapes of the light curves depend strongly on the inclination of the binary orbit and its orientation relative to the observer and on the accretion rate.

The orbit with encounter at apocenter shows fast clockwise rotation. The orbit with encounter at pericenter rotated counterclockwise.

The orbital elements show a very regular behavior on time interval about 3000 years. Due to Laplace theorem, at low perturbation, semimajor axis has only small short periodic oscillations.

40|$|Context. Planetesimals {{and planets}} {{embedded}} in a circumstellar disk are dynamically perturbed by the disk gravity. It causes an <b>apsidal</b> <b>line</b> precession {{at a rate that}} depends on the disk density profile and on the distance of the massive body from the star. Aims: Different analytical models are exploited to compute the precession rate of the perihelion ϖ˙. We compare them to verify their equivalence, in particular after analytical manipulations performed to derive handy formulas, and test their predictions against numerical models in some selected cases. Methods: The theoretical precession rates were computed with analytical algorithms found in the literature using the Mathematica symbolic code, while the numerical simulations were performed with the hydrodynamical code FARGO. Results: For low-mass bodies (planetesimals) the analytical approaches described in Binney & Tremaine (2008, Galactic Dynamics, p. 96), Ward (1981, Icarus, 47, 234), and Silsbee & Rafikov (2015 a, ApJ, 798, 71) are equivalent under the same initial conditions for the disk in terms of mass, density profile, and inner and outer borders. They also match the numerical values computed with FARGO away from the outer border of the disk reasonably well. On the other hand, the predictions of the classical Mestel disk (Mestel 1963, MNRAS, 126, 553) for disks with p = 1 significantly depart from the numerical solution for radial distances beyond one-third of the disk extension because of the underlying assumption of the Mestel disk is that the outer disk border is equal to infinity. For massive bodies such as terrestrial and giant planets, the agreement of the analytical approaches is progressively poorer because of the changes in the disk structure that are induced by the planet gravity. For giant planets the precession rate changes sign and is higher than the modulus of the theoretical value by a factor ranging from 1. 5 to 1. 8. In this case, the correction of the formula proposed by Ward (1981) to account for the presence of a gap is a better approximation, at least in predicting a positive precession rate. Conclusions: Analytical modeling of the precession rate of massive bodies {{embedded in a}} circumstellar disk is accurate for planetesimals and terrestrial planets, but it becomes inaccurate when Jupiter-sized planets are considered. The changes they induce in the disk reverse the precession rate and increase it by more than 50...|$|E

40|$|We analyse the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) {{measurements}} {{of a system}} of two super-Earths detected as Kepler- 29, in order to constrain the planets' masses and orbital parameters. A dynamical analysis of the best-fitting configurations constrains the masses to be ∼ 6 and ∼ 5 Earth masses for the inner and the outer planets, respectively. The analysis also reveals that the system is likely locked in the 9 : 7 mean motion resonance. However, a variety of orbital architectures regarding eccentricities and the relative orientation of orbits is permitted by the observations as well as by stability constraints. We attempt to find configurations preferred by the planet formation scenarios as an additional, physical constraint. We show that configurations with low eccentricities and anti-aligned <b>apsidal</b> <b>lines</b> of the orbits are a natural and most likely outcome of the convergent migration. However, we show that librations of the critical angles are not necessary for the Kepler- 29 system to be dynamically resonant, and such configurations may be formed on the way of migration as well.

The true three-body Laplace MMR exhibits the critical angle librating around 45 degrees and aligned apsides of {{the inner and outer}} pair of planets. In the Laplace MMR formed through a chain of two-planet 5 : 4 and 4 : 3 MMRs, all critical angles librate with small amplitudes of ~ 30 degrees and <b>apsidal</b> <b>lines</b> in planet's pairs are anti-aligned.

We {{clarify the}} {{response}} of extrasolar planetary systems in a 2 : 1 mean motion commensurability with masses ranging from the super Jovian range to the terrestrial range to stochastic forcing that could result from protoplanetary disk turbulence. The behaviour of the different libration modes {{for a wide range}} of system parameters and stochastic forcing magnitudes is investigated. The growth of libration amplitudes is parameterized as a function of the relevant physical parameters. The results are applied to provide an explanation of the configuration of the HD 128311 system. Methods. We first develop an analytic model from first principles without making the assumption that both eccentricities are small. We also perform numerical N-body simulations with additional stochastic forcing terms to represent the effects of putative disk turbulence. Results. Systems are quickly destabilized by large magnitudes of stochastic forcing but some stability is imparted should systems undergo a net orbital migration. The slow mode, which mostly corresponds to motion of the angle between the <b>apsidal</b> <b>lines</b> of the two planets, is converted to circulation more readily than the fast mode which is associated with oscillations of the semi-major axes. This mode is also vulnerable to the attainment of small eccentricities which causes oscillations between periods of libration and circulation. Conclusions.

Global modes that are strongly coupled to inner protoplanets are found to have disc orbits which tend to have <b>apsidal</b> <b>lines</b> antialigned with respect {{to those of the}} inner protoplanets. Other modes corresponding to free disc modes may be global over a large range of length scales and accordingly be long lived. We consider the motion of a protoplanet in the earth mass range embedded in an eccentric disc and determine the equilibrium orbits which maintain fixed apsidal alignment with respect to the disc gas orbits. Equilibrium eccentricities are found to be comparable or possibly exceed the disc eccentricity. We then approximately calculate the tidal interaction with the disc in order to estimate the orbital migration rate. Results are found to deviate from the case of axisymmetric disc with near circular protoplanet orbit once eccentricities of protoplanet and disc orbits become comparable to the disc aspect ratio in magnitude. Aligned protoplanet orbits with very similar eccentricity to that of the gas disc are found to undergo litle eccentricity change while undergoing inward migration in general. However, for significantly larger orbital eccentricities, migration may be significantly reduced or even reverse from inwards to outwards. Thus the existence of global non circular motions in discs with radial excursions comparable to the semi-thickness may have important consequences for the migration and survival of protoplanetary cores in the earth mass range.

Improved measurement of the eccentricity will soon allow for far tighter limits to be placed on all three of these quantities, and will provide an unprecedented probe into the interior structure of an extrasolar planet.

40|$|The pulsar triple system J 0337 + 1715 {{is remarkably}} regular and highly hierarchical. Secular {{interactions}} transfer angular momentum between {{inner and outer}} orbits unless their <b>apsidal</b> <b>lines</b> are parallel or anti-parallel. These choices correspond to orthogonal eigenmodes p and are characterized by e_(p, 1) /e_(p, 2) ~ a_(1) /a_(2) and e_(a, 1) /e_(a, 2) ~ (a_(1) /a_(2)) ^(− 3 / 2) (m_(2) /m_(1)). Mode p dominates the current state so e 1 /e 2 remains close to e_(p, 1) /e_(p, 2). A small contribution by Mode a causes e 1 and e_(2) to oscillate with a period of ~ 10 ^(3) [*][*]yr which should be apparent in a few years. These will reveal the effects of general relativity, and possibly the distortion of the inner white dwarf (WD). Phinney proposes that the epicyclic energy of a WD-pulsar binary reaches equipartition with the kinetic energy of a single convective eddy when the WD's progenitor fills its Roche lobe. We extend Phinney's theory to apply to modes rather than individual orbits. Thus we predict that Mode p and Mode a achieved equipartition with eddies in the giant envelopes of the progenitors of the outer and inner WD, respectively. The most effective eddies are those with lifetimes closest to the orbit period. These were far more energetic in the progenitor of the outer WD. This explains why Mode p overwhelms Mode a, and also why the inner binary's orbit is far more eccentric than orbits of other WD-pulsar binaries with similar orbit periods. Mode a's small but finite amplitude places a lower bound of Q ~ 10 ^(6) on the tidal quality parameter of the inner WD...|$|R
40|$|Fast radio bursts (FRBs), a novel type {{of radio}} pulse, whose physics {{is not yet}} {{understood}} at all. Only a handful of FRBs had been detected when we started this project. Taking account of the scant observations, we put physical constraints on FRBs. We excluded proposals of a galactic origin for their extraordinarily high dispersion measures (DM), in particular stellar coronas and HII regions. Therefore our work supports an extragalactic origin for FRBs. We show that the resolved scattering tail of FRB 110220 {{is unlikely to be}} due to propagation through the intergalactic plasma. Instead the scattering is probably caused by the interstellar medium in the FRB's host galaxy, and indicates that this burst sits in the central region of that galaxy. Pulse durations of order ms constrain source sizes of FRBs implying enormous brightness temperatures and thus coherent emission. Electric fields near FRBs at cosmological distances would be so strong that they could accelerate free electrons from rest to relativistic energies in a single wave period. When we worked on FRBs, it was unclear whether they were genuine astronomical signals as distinct from 'perytons', clearly terrestrial radio bursts, sharing some common properties with FRBs. Recently, in April 2015, astronomers discovered that perytons were emitted by microwave ovens. Radio chirps similar to FRBs were emitted when their doors opened while they were still heating. Evidence for the astronomical nature of FRBs has strengthened since our paper was published. Some bursts have been found to show linear and circular polarizations and Faraday rotation of the linear polarization has also been detected. I hope to resume working on FRBs in the near future. But after we completed our FRB paper, I decided to pause this project {{because of the lack of}} observational constraints. The pulsar triple system, J 0733 + 1715, has its orbital parameters fitted to high accuracy owing to the precise timing of the central ms pulsar. The two orbits are highly hierarchical, namely P orb, 1 &# 60;&# 60; P orb, 2, where 1 and 2 label the inner and outer white dwarf (WD) companions respectively. Moreover, their orbital planes almost coincide, providing a unique opportunity to study secular interaction associated purely with eccentricity beyond the solar system. Secular interaction only involves effect averaged over many orbits. Thus each companion can be represented by an elliptical wire with its mass distributed inversely proportional to its local orbital speed. Generally there exists a mutual torque, which vanishes only when their <b>apsidal</b> <b>lines</b> are parallel or anti-parallel. To maintain either mode, the eccentricity ratio, e 1 /e 2, must be of the proper value, so that both <b>apsidal</b> <b>lines</b> precess together. For J 0733 + 1715, e 1 &# 60;&# 60; e 2 for the parallel mode, while e 1 &# 62;&# 62; e 2 for the anti-parallel one. We show that the former precesses 10 times slower than the latter. Currently the system is dominated by the parallel mode. Although only a little anti-parallel mode survives, both eccentricities especially e 1 oscillate on 10 3 yr timescale. Detectable changes would occur within 1. We demonstrate that the anti-parallel mode gets damped 10 4 times faster than its parallel brother by any dissipative process diminishing e 1. If it is the tidal damping in the inner WD, we proceed to estimate its tidal quantity parameter (Q) to be 10 6, which was poorly constrained by observations. However, tidal damping may also happen during the preceding low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) phase or hydrogen thermal nuclear flashes. But, in both cases, the inner companion fills its Roche lobe and probably suffers mass/angular momentum loss, which might cause e 1 to grow rather than decay. Several pairs of solar system satellites occupy mean motion resonances (MMRs). We divide these into two groups according to their proximity to exact resonance. Proximity is measured by the existence of a separatrix in phase space. MMRs between Io-Europa, Europa-Ganymede and Enceladus-Dione are too distant from exact resonance for a separatrix to appear. A separatrix is present only in the phase spaces of the Mimas-Tethys and Titan-Hyperion MMRs and their resonant arguments are the only ones to exhibit substantial librations. When a separatrix is present, tidal damping of eccentricity or inclination excites overstable librations that can lead to passage through resonance on the damping timescale. However, after investigation, we conclude that the librations in the Mimas-Tethys and Titan-Hyperion MMRs are fossils and do not result from overstability. Rubble piles are common in the solar system. Monolithic elements touch their neighbors in small localized areas. Voids occupy a significant fraction of the volume. In a fluid-free environment, heat cannot conduct through voids; only radiation can transfer energy across them. We model the effective thermal conductivity of a rubble pile and show that it is proportional the square root of the pressure, P, for P≤ ε 3 μ where ε is the material's yield strain and μ its shear modulus. Our model provides an excellent fit to the depth dependence of the thermal conductivity in the top 140 cm of the lunar regolith. It also offers an explanation for the low thermal inertias of rocky asteroids and icy satellites. Lastly, we discuss how rubble piles slow down the cooling of small bodies such as asteroids. Electromagnetic (EM) follow-up observations of gravitational wave (GW) events will help shed light on the nature of the sources, and more can be learned if the EM follow-ups can start as soon as the GW event becomes observable. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient time-domain algorithm capable of detecting gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing binaries of compact objects with nearly zero time delay. In case when the signal is strong enough, our algorithm also has the flexibility to trigger EM observation before the merger. The key to the efficiency of our algorithm arises from the use of chains of so-called Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, which filter time-series data recursively. Computational cost is further reduced by a template interpolation technique that requires filtering to be done only for a much coarser template bank than otherwise required to sufficiently recover optimal signal-to-noise ratio. Towards future detectors with sensitivity extending to lower frequencies, our algorithm's computational cost is shown to increase rather insignificantly compared to the conventional time-domain correlation method. Moreover, at latencies of less than hundreds to thousands of seconds, this method is expected to be computationally more efficient than the straightforward frequency-domain method. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} {{interaction}} of a satellite and a nearby ringlet on eccentric and inclined orbits. Secular torques originate from mean motion resonances and the secular interaction potential which represents the m= 1 global modes of the ring. The torques act on the relative eccentricity and inclination. The resonances damp the relative eccentricity. The inclination instability owing to the resonances is turned off by a finite differential eccentricity {{of the order of}} 0. 27 for nearly coplanar systems. The secular potential torque damps the eccentricity and inclination and does not affect the relative semi-major axis; also, it suppresses the inclination instability that persists at small differential eccentricities. The damping of the relative eccentricity and inclination forces an initially circular and planar small mass ringlet to reach the eccentricity and inclination of the satellite. When the planet is oblate, {{the interaction of}} the satellite damps the proper precession of a small mass ringlet so that it precesses at the satellite's rate independently of their relative distance. The oblateness of the primary modifies the long-term eccentricity and inclination magnitudes and introduces a constant shift in the <b>apsidal</b> and nodal <b>lines</b> of the ringlet with respect to those of the satellite. These results are applied to Saturn's F-ring, which orbits between the moons Prometheus and Pandora...|$|R
