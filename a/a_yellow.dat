5|$|Few {{inorganic}} lead(IV) compounds are known, {{and these}} exist only in highly acidic solutions. Lead(II) oxide gives a mixed oxide on further oxidation, Pb3O4. It {{is described as}} lead(II,IV) oxide, or structurally 2PbO·PbO2, and is the best-known mixed valence lead compound. Lead dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas. This is because the expected PbCl4 that would be produced is unstable and spontaneously decomposes to PbCl2 and Cl2. Analogously to lead monoxide, lead dioxide is capable of forming plumbate anions. Lead disulfide and lead diselenide are only stable at high pressures. Lead tetrafluoride, <b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> crystalline powder, is stable, but less so than the difluoride. Lead tetrachloride (<b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> oil) decomposes at room temperature, lead tetrabromide is less stable still, {{and the existence of}} lead tetraiodide is questionable.|$|E

5000|$|Four {{models of}} this signal exist. The one with 4 lamps {{is the most}} common. It has a steady red arrow, <b>a</b> steady <b>yellow</b> arrow, <b>a</b> {{flashing}} <b>yellow</b> arrow, and <b>a</b> steady green arrow. One rare version has five lenses, with a steady red arrow, two steady <b>yellow</b> arrows, <b>a</b> flashing <b>yellow</b> arrow, and <b>a</b> steady green arrow, and is only used sometimes, {{when there is a}} leading protected left turn. There are also two with 3 lamps. One signal has a steady red arrow, <b>a</b> steady <b>yellow</b> arrow, and <b>a</b> [...] "dual indication" [...] third lamp which can display either a steady green arrow or <b>a</b> flashing <b>yellow</b> arrow. The other 3-lamp signal has a steady red arrow, <b>a</b> steady <b>yellow</b> arrow and <b>a</b> flashing <b>yellow</b> arrow, with no green arrow; this can be used for either left or right turns, and is used to prevent yellow trap where no green arrow left turn phase exists on the approach. This cannot be done with the circular green without causing <b>yellow</b> trap, because <b>a</b> circular green releases other movements. The steady arrows all have their usual meanings. <b>A</b> flashing <b>yellow</b> arrow indicates <b>a</b> [...] "permitted" [...] left turn, where drivers may turn left without stopping (same as a Yield Sign), but opposing traffic has the right-of-way. The flashing yellow arrow must always be followed by either <b>a</b> steady <b>yellow</b> arrow or <b>a</b> steady green arrow.|$|R
