5|$|The {{company that}} {{produced}} <b>Another</b> <b>World,</b> Delphine Software, has since gone into administrative receivership and <b>Another</b> <b>World</b> remains their most recognized game. Paul Cuisset's best-selling 1992 game Flashback, also released by Delphine but created without any involvement from Chahi, features similar gameplay and graphics {{and makes a}} few nods to <b>Another</b> <b>World,</b> {{including the use of}} personal force fields in combat, a nearly identical end text in the ending cutscene, and an almost exact motion recreation of the gun pickup cutscene. A very similar plot premise was used in 1999's Outcast by Infogrames Entertainment, too from France. The game also had a big influence on several other game designers, especially in Japan. Fumito Ueda cited <b>Another</b> <b>World</b> as an inspiration for his creation of Ico.
