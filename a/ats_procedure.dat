40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new efficient monolithic finite element solution scheme {{to treat the}} set of PDEs governing a two-dimensional, biphasic, saturated TPM model with intrinsically coupled and incompressible solid and fluid constituents for infinitesimal and large elastic deformation. Our approach, which inherits some of its techniques from CFD, {{is characterized by the}} following aspects: (1) It only performs operator evaluation with no additional Gateaux derivatives. In particular, the computations of the time-consuming material tangent matrix are not involved here; (2) It solves the non-linear dynamic problem with no restriction on the strength of coupling; (3) It is more efficient than the linear uvp solver discussed in previous works; (4) It requires weaker derivatives and hence lower order FE can be tested; (5) The boundary conditions are reduced, solution independent and more convenient to apply than in the old uvp formulation. For the purpose of validation and comparison, prototypical simulations including analytical solutions are carried out and at the end, an adaptive time stepping (<b>ATS)</b> <b>procedure</b> is introduced to handle the rapid change in the numbers of non-linear iterations that may occur...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of procedures and procedure calls introduces side effects, which complicate {{the analysis of}} stale reference detection in compiler-directed cache coherence schemes [4, 3, 10]. Previous compiler algorithms use the invalidation of an entire cache <b>at</b> <b>procedure</b> boundary [5, 8] or inlining [8] to avoid reference marking interprocedurally. However, frequent cache invalidations will result in poor performance since locality can not be exploited across the procedure boundary. Also, the inlining is often prohibitive due to both its code expansion and increase in its compilation time and memory requirements. In this paper, we introduce an improved intraprocedural and interprocedural algorithms for detecting references to stale data. The intraprocedural algorithm can mark potential stale references without relying on any cache invalidation or inlining <b>at</b> <b>procedure</b> boundaries, thus avoiding unnecessary cache misses for subroutine local data. The interprocedural algorithm performs bot [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Inter-procedural {{register}} allocation can {{minimize the}} register usage penalty <b>at</b> <b>procedure</b> calls {{by reducing the}} saving and restoring of registers <b>at</b> <b>procedure</b> boun-daries. A one-pass inter-procedural register allocation scheme based on processing the procedures in a depth-first traversal of the calI graph is presented. This scheme can be overlayed on top of intra-procedural register allocation via a simple extension to the priority-based coloring algorithm. Using two different usage conventions for the registers, the scheme can dis-tribute register saves/restores throughout the call graph even {{in the presence of}} recursion, indirect calls or separate compilation. A natural and efficient way to pass parameters emerges from this scheme. A separate technique uses data flow analysis to optimize the place-ment of the save/restore code for registers within indivi-dual procedures. The techniques described have been implemented in a production compiler suite. Measure-ments of the effects of these techniques on a set of practical programs are presented and the results analysed. 1...|$|R
40|$|Protein domains are {{considered}} to be fundamental units of protein evolution. Many proteins consist of multiple domains, and domain combinations are closely linked with the function and evolutionary history of proteins. Domain loss and gene loss may lead to immediate loss of gene function. Domain combination of genes could also potentially attribute to the diversity of organisms. My purpose is to search human-, primate-, rodents-, and mammalian-specific domain combinations created through domain gain and loss. I retrieved domain combinations of vertebrate proteins from genome data, and defined a repertoire of domain combinations of an organism as a set of combinations encoded in its genome. Pfam ([URL] was used for the analysis as a domain database. I extracted domain information and functions of vertebrate proteins from GTOP ([URL] In order to examine the phylogeny of domain combinations, I followed the nine <b>procedures.</b> <b>At</b> <b>procedure</b> 1, I enumerated 17, 358 domain combinations from 37 Metazoa genome data set. <b>At</b> <b>procedure</b> 2, I selected domain combinations of eight species with steady genome data (human, chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, mouse, rat, dog, opossum, and chicken). Opossum and chicken were used as outgroup to placental mammals. <b>At</b> <b>procedure</b> 3, I removed domain combinations of outgroup species from the list of domain combinations left after <b>procedure</b> 2. <b>At</b> <b>procedure</b> 4, I selected lineage specific domaincombinations (human-, primate-, rodents-, and mammalian-specific). <b>At</b> <b>procedure</b> 5, Iselected only the protein sequences existing in SWISS-PROT([URL] <b>At</b> <b>procedure</b> 6, I selected data with high scores by BLASTPas orthologue candidates. <b>At</b> <b>procedure</b> 7, I retained well-aligned sequences by usingClustalW multiple alignment. <b>At</b> <b>procedure</b> 8, I constructed phylogenetic trees toidentify orthologues. <b>At</b> <b>procedure</b> 9, I eliminated domain combinations that were alsofound in more than one outgroup Metazoan species. 　After following procedures 1 to 9, I selected 34 mammalian-specific, 17 primate- specific, 10 human-specific, and 14 rodent-specific domain combinations. As the branch in thespecies tree becomes shorter, the frequency of the appearance of novel domains andnovel domain combinations tends to decrease. This is why thenumber of lineage-specific domain combinations decreases as we go down the speciestree from mammalian ancestors via primate ancestors to humans. 　I classified the remaining proteins into seven groups as follows; group 1 : emergence ofnew domain, group 2 : insertion of one (or more) domain into existing protein, group 3 : deletion of one (or more) domain from existing protein, group 4 : change of domain order, group 5 : increase of domain copy number, group 6 : decrease of domain copy number, andgroup 5 / 6 : case when {{it is not possible to}} distinguish increase or decrease of domain copynumber. As a result, four lineage-specific domain combinations were decomposed intothese seven groups: mammal-specific(14, 10, 1, 0, 7, 2 and 0), primate-specific (3, 4, 1, 0, 4, 5 and 0), human-specific (1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0 and 1), rodent-specific (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 and 13) in the order of groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 5 / 6, respectively, in parentheses. There was nogroup 4 proteins. Mammal-specific group 1 proteins include various interleukins andmacrophage scavenger receptor. This implies that the mammals upgraded theimmunity system using these new proteins. Out of the seventeen proteins belonging to group 2 and group 3 for all four lineages, twelve in fact did not undergo deletion and insertion of domains that are very definitions of these two groups. These sequences havegradually changed their amino acid sequences via substitionts as the species evolved, and their regions came to be recognized as domains at certain points in evolution. To putit another way, even orthologous proteins that appear to have no domains actually have "pre-domain" sequences which can be detected with thresholds lower than the defaultvalue of the domain search program. This was revealed by the fact that, for theseproteins, the taxonomic ranges of domain annotation vary depending on the thresholdsfed into the domain search program. Other than the above-mentioned proteins, group 2 also includes signal transduction proteins, for example, regulator of G-protein signaling 3 protein, LIM kinase 2 and ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase. These proteins may have been involved in the evolution of lineage-specific signaling networks. Interestingly, lineage-specific domain combinations caused by insertions or deletions of domainsalways accompany alternative splicing products or paralogous proteins of the ancestralforms, which seem to alleviate the risk of impaired original functions, which could leadto lethality. It 2 ̆ 7 s interesting such backups are working as if they were a kind of insurance. 　Aside from my main procedures 1 through 9, I also conducted secondary analyses andfound several domain combinations that do not belong to the seven groups mentionedabove. Examples of proteins with such domain combinations are: sex-determining region Y protein (SRY), which is conserved throughout therians but is absent in other vertebrates; uricase and L-gulonolactone oxidase, which are absent only in primates. 　In this research, I focused on mammals and performed analysis. Compared to thenumbers of lineage specific, new domain appearance including bacteria, appearance of novel domain in the mammalian lineage is rare because of the short evolution time. In such a situation, however, I found 34 mammal-specific, 17 primate -specific, 10 human-specific, and 14 roden-specific domain combinations. As a result of detailedanalysis, I discovered five cases where domain insertion occured...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: We {{compared}} {{two different}} approaches to right laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy for large tumors (> 5 cm) : the anterior transperitoneal (AT) and lateral transperitoneal (LT) approaches. Methods: 40 patients with a right large adrenal mass > 5 cm underwent right adrenalectomy: 20 patients underwent the <b>AT</b> <b>procedure</b> and 20 patients the LT procedure. Preoperative characteristics were similar for both groups: mean tumor size for the AT and LT groups was 6. 52 cm (range 5. 2 - 8. 5) and 6. 59 cm (range 5. 4 - 8. 1), respectively. Mean patient's age was 53 years (23 - 75 in the AT group and 20 - 77 in the LT group). AT and LT approaches were compared in terms of operative time, intraoperative blood loss, time to first oral intake and postoperative convalescence. Results: No difference was found between two groups in terms of estimated blood (100 ml for the AT group and 105. 3 ml for the LT group), time to first oral intake (2. 0 days for both groups) and convalescence (3. 5 and 3 days, respectively). The mean operative times of the <b>AT</b> and LT <b>procedures</b> were 75. 25 and 84. 75 min, respectively: this difference was statistically significant at the Student's t test (p = 0. 0423). Conclusions: Both approaches proved {{to be safe and}} minimally invasive. We believe that the shorter operative time of <b>AT</b> <b>procedures</b> was related to the better visibility of familiar anatomic landmarks, easier access to the vessels and a larger operative field. For these reasons, we prefer the AT approach in the management of large adrenal masses. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG...|$|R
