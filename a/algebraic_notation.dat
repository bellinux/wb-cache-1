25|$|The {{book was}} {{originally}} published in descriptive notation. An <b>algebraic</b> <b>notation</b> version in 1995 caused some controversy in the chess world because of the many other changes made to the text, with Fischer himself denouncing the edition. In 2008 a reissue of Fischer's original text was published, the only changes being the updating to <b>algebraic</b> <b>notation</b> and the correcting of typographical errors, notation mistakes, and the erroneous last few moves of game 17 (versus Mikhail Tal).|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe give an {{algebraic}} {{version of}} the enumeration of combinatorial objects (ECO) method, and of succession rules in general, by means of linear operators. Then, using the new <b>algebraic</b> <b>notations,</b> we translate some known results {{about the relationship between}} ECO-systems and generating functions into our language. Finally, we deal with the problem of the standard form for succession rules, giving a general, though purely theoretical, solution, that is more precisely, a “compact expression” for the desired standard form...|$|R
40|$|In {{this short}} note we relate some known {{properties}} of propositional calculus to purely algebraic considerations of a Boolean algebra. Classes of formulas of propositional calculus are considered as {{elements of a}} Boolean algebra. As such they can be represented by uniquely defined elements of this algebra which we call "logical primes". The <b>algebraic</b> <b>notations</b> appear useful because they {{make it possible to}} derive well known properties of propositional calculus by simple calculations or to substitute lengthy logical considerations by schematic algebraic manipulations...|$|R

25|$|Reversible <b>algebraic</b> <b>notation</b> (RAN) {{is based}} on LAN, but adds an {{additional}} letter for the piece that was captured, if any. The move can be reversed by moving the piece to its original square, and restoring the captured piece. For example, Rd2xBd6.|$|E

25|$|The long {{notation}} {{takes more}} space {{and thus is}} not as commonly used. However, it {{has the advantage of}} clarity, particularly for less-skilled players or players learning the game. Some books using primarily short <b>algebraic</b> <b>notation</b> use the long notation instead of the disambiguation forms described earlier.|$|E
25|$|Concise {{reversible}} <b>algebraic</b> <b>notation</b> (CRAN) is like RAN, but omits {{the file}} or rank {{if it is}} not needed to disambiguate the move. For example, Rd2xB6. This notation is recommended by Gene Milener in Play Stronger Chess by Examining Chess 960: Usable Strategies for Fischer Random Chess Discovered.|$|E
25|$|Players {{who speak}} other {{languages}} may employ different letters, for example, French-speaking players use F for bishop (from fou). In chess literature, especially that intended {{for an international}} audience, the language-specific letters are often replaced by universal icons for the pieces, for example, Nf3 is represented as ♞f3. This style known as figurine <b>algebraic</b> <b>notation.</b>|$|E
40|$|Mathematical {{modeling}} and constraint programming languages have orthogonal strengths in stating combinatorial optimization problems. Modeling languages typically feature high-level set and <b>algebraic</b> <b>notations,</b> while constraint programming languages provide a rich constraint {{language and the}} ability to specify search procedures. This paper shows that many of the functionalities typically found in modeling languages can be integrated elegantly in constraint programming libraries without defining a specific language or preprocessor. In particular, it presents the design of OPL++, a C++ modeling layer for constraint programming that combines the salient features of both approaches. Of particular interest is the one-to-one correspondence between high-level models and OPL++ statements and the negligible overhead induced by the extension...|$|R
