40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the survival rates of three fish species, the brown comber (Serranus hepatus), black goby (Gobius niger) and <b>annular</b> <b>seabream</b> (Diplodus annularis), after their escape from a 40 mm stretched diamond mesh polyethylene (PE) codend. Experiments were {{carried out in the}} eastern Mediterranean in September 2007 using a conventional bottom trawl with 600 meshes around the mouth. A constant 15 min towing duration was used for all hauls. The towing speed varied between 2. 0 and 2. 5 knots. Codend covers, supported by two hoops, were used to retain escaping fish. At the end of each haul, these covers were detached from the codend, fixed to the sea floor at depths of 19 to 28 m, and then observed by the divers for a period of seven days. On the eighth day, all of the covers were lifted up and the survivors and mortalities were counted and measured. The mean survival percentages of open codend and experimental cages were found to be 97. 1 % and 98. 3 % for brown comber, 69. 0 % and 77. 2 % for black goby, and 97. 5 % and 98. 6 % for <b>annular</b> <b>seabream</b> respectively...|$|E
40|$|The present work aims to {{estimate}} the shore-based recreational angling fisheries catches per species and Greek subarea that are not recorded by the official authorities {{in order to have}} a better picture of the total fish biomass that is removed out of the Greek Seas. Shore-based recreational fishers (n = 406) from three coastal areas of Greece (Ionian Sea and northern and central Aegean Sea) were surveyed in 2008 - 2009 and in 2012, respectively, in terms of the frequency and duration of fishing per year, species caught and catch in weight. Shore-based recreational angling catches increased from 187 tn in 1950 to slightly over 2500 tn in 2010. The species dominating the catches varied with area. Overall, 48 species participated to the total catches, four of which (European seabass Dicentrarchus labrax, <b>annular</b> <b>seabream</b> Diplodus annularis, white seabream Diplodus sargus sargus and gilthead seabream Sparus aurata) contributed more than 40. 0 % of the total...|$|E
40|$|The {{induction}} of hepatic cytochrome P 4501 A 1 and its monooxygenase activity 7 -ethoxyresorufin O- deethylase, (EROD) in fish by PAHs, PCBs and dioxins {{has been}} suggested as an early warning system “most sensitive biochemical response ” for assessing environmental contamination conditions. In this study, the degree of induction of cytochrome P 4501 A 1 protein as determined immunochemically and CYP 1 A 1 associated EROD activity in fish were utilized as biomarkers of exposure to PAHs, PCBs and related organic pollutants along the İzmir Bay on the Aegean Sea Coast after the Great Canal Project. Three different fish species were used throughout this study, namely leaping mullet (Liza saliens), <b>annular</b> <b>seabream</b> (Diplodus annularis) and common sole (Solea vulgaris) which were representatives of pelagic, benthopelagic and benthic fish, respectively. Fish were sampled in November 2002 and October 2003 from different sites of the Bay. The mullet caught from Harbor, Üçkuyular port site, and Pasaport region displayed highly elevated EROD activities which were 2258 ± 840 (n= 15), 2011 ± 490 (n= 4), 1813 ± 287 (n= 11) pmole /min/mg protein, respectively and were 104, 80 and 79 fol...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHere {{we report}} the cDNA cloning of a {{phospholipase}} A 2 (PLA 2) from five Sparidae species. The deduced amino acid sequences show high similarity with pancreatic PLA 2. In addition, a phylogenetic tree derived from alignment of various available sequences revealed that Sparidae PLA 2 {{are closer to}} avian PLA 2 group IB than to mammals' ones. In {{order to understand the}} structure-function relationships of these enzymes, we report here the recombinant expression in E. coli, the refolding and characterization of His-tagged <b>annular</b> <b>seabream</b> PLA 2 (AsPLA 2). A single Ni-affinity chromatography step was used to obtain a highly purified recombinant AsPLA 2 with a molecular mass of 15 kDa as attested by gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data. The enzyme has a specific activity of 400 U. mg(- 1) measured on phosphatidylcholine at pH 8. 5 and 50 °C. The enzyme high thermo-activity and thermo-stability make it a potential candidate in various biological applications. The 3 D structure models of these enzymes were compared with structures of phylogenetically related pancreatic PLA 2. By following these models and utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, the resistance of the AsPLA 2 at high temperatures was explained. Using the monomolecular film technique, AsPLA 2 was found to be active on various phospholipids spread at the air/water interface at a surface pressure between 12 and 25 dyncm(- 1). Interestingly, this enzyme was shown to be mostly active on dilauroyl-phosphatidylglycerol monolayers and this behavior was confirmed by molecular docking and dynamics simulations analysis. The discovery of a thermo-active new member of Sparidae PLA 2, provides new insights on structure-activity relationships of fish PLA 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{short-term}} {{movements of}} a small temperate fish, the <b>annular</b> <b>seabream</b> Diplodus annularis (Linnaeus 1758), were examined using standard tag-recapture and passive acoustic telemetry in Palma Bay (NW Mediterranean), a marine protected area (MPA). The study aimed to provide valuable information for assessing the recreational fishery and its results suggest that MPAs {{can be used to}} protect the adult stock of D. annularis. All the fish tagged with standard tags were recaptured near the release locations, with a maximum distance of ~ 300 m. The maximum time between release and recapture was 185 d. Two different arrays of acoustic receivers were deployed, one in 2008 and another in 2009, within the MPA. Twenty adults were surgically tagged with acoustic transmitters. Fish monitored in 2008 (n = 12) were translocated from the point of capture to analyse the movement behaviour after artificial displacement. Upon release at displaced locations, 67 % of the fish moved towards the original capture location using a time of return that ranged from 0. 75 to 15. 25 h. Fish monitored in 2009 (n = 8) were released at the point of capture. They showed high site fidelity with a maximum period of 27 d between the first time and the last time they were detected. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the current level}} of knowledge concerning several biological characteristics of the Mediterranean marine fishes by carrying out a gap analysis based on information extracted from the literature, aiming to identify research trends and future needs in the field of Mediterranean fish biology {{that can be used in}} stock assessments, ecosystem modeling and fisheries management. Based on the datasets that emerged from the literature review, there is no information on any biological characteristic for 43 % (n = 310) of the Mediterranean fish species, whereas for an additional 15 % (n = 109) of them there is information about just one characteristic. The gap between current and desired knowledge (defined here as having information on most biological characteristics for at least half of the Mediterranean marine fishes) is smaller in length-weight relationships, which have been studied for 43 % of the species, followed by spawning (39 %), diet (29 %), growth (25 %), maturity (24 %), lifespan (19 %) and fecundity (17 %). The gap is larger in natural mortality for which information is very scarce (8 %). European hake (Merluccius merluccius), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), <b>annular</b> <b>seabream</b> (Diplodus annularis), common pandora (Pagellus erythrinus), European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus) and bogue (Boops boops) were the most studied species, while sharks and rays were among the least studied ones. Only 25 species were fully studied, i. e. there was available information on all their biological characteristics. The knowledge gaps per characteristic varied among the western, central and eastern Mediterranean subregions. The number of available records per species was positively related to total landings, while no relationship emerged with its maximum reported length, trophic level and commercial value. Future research priorities that should be focused on less studied species (e. g. sharks and rays) and mortality/fecundity instead of length-weight relationships, as well as the economy of scientific sampling (using the entire catch to acquire data on as many biological characteristics as possible) are discussed...|$|E
