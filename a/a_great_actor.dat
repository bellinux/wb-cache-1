Howard Thompson, the film critic of The New York Times, wrote that [...] "Flynn, as the late John Barrymore, a moody, wild-drinking ruin of <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>actor,</b> steals the picture, lock, stock and keg.

The final {{years of his life}} were spent in Angmering, West Sussex, with Violet. Holloway forged close friendships with fellow performers including Leslie Henson, Gracie Fields, Maurice Chevalier, Laurence Olivier and Arthur Askey, who said of him, [...] "He was the nicest man I ever knew.

Stravinsky, Auric, poets, painters, and I myself have seen no comparable display of artistry on the stage since Nijinsky."

But also I feel like there have to be stakes. This year was filled with foreboding of violence and death, and the connection of that early summer between the riots, which resulted in death, police killing innocent people, and the Richard Speck murders and the guy on the Texas tower [...] The randomness and the nihilism that was born from that was something that permeated the story. Lane's story I thought was about someone who has undervalued themselves and that was his only way out, he thought." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{comparing}} Olivier and {{the other}} leading actors of his generation, Ustinov wrote, [...] "It is of course vain to talk of who is and who is not the <b>greatest</b> <b>actor.</b> There is simply {{no such thing as}} <b>a</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>actor,</b> or painter or composer". Nonetheless, some colleagues, particularly film actors such as Spencer Tracy, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, came to regard Olivier as the finest of his peers. Peter Hall, though acknowledging Olivier {{as the head of the}} theatrical profession, thought Richardson the <b>greater</b> <b>actor.</b> Others, such as the critic Michael Coveney, awarded the palm to Gielgud. Olivier's claim to theatrical greatness lay not only in his acting, but as, in Hall's words, [...] "the supreme man of the theatre of our time", pioneering Britain's National Theatre. As Bragg identified, [...] "no one doubts that the National is perhaps his most enduring monument".|$|R
500|$|Richardson {{had gained}} a {{national}} reputation as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>actor</b> {{while at the}} Old Vic; films gave {{him the opportunity to}} reach an international audience. Unlike some of his theatre colleagues, he was never condescending about film work. He admitted that film could be [...] "a cage for an actor, but a cage in which they sometimes put a little gold", but he did not regard filming as merely a means of subsidising his much less profitable stage work. He said, [...] "I've never been one of those chaps who scoff at films. I think they're a marvellous medium, and are to the stage what engravings are to painting. The theatre may give you big chances, but the cinema teaches you the details of craftsmanship." [...] The Fallen Idol was followed by Richardson's first Hollywood part. He played Dr Sloper, the overprotective father of Olivia de Havilland in The Heiress, [...] based on Henry James's novel Washington Square. The film did not prosper at the box-office despite good reviews, [...] an Academy Award for Best Actress for Havilland, and nominations for the director (William Wyler) and Richardson.|$|E

So we had to start to soften {{it up a little bit}} and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m glad he gave us that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>actor</b> to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so fun to watch ," [...] adding that [...] "a lot of that emotion was real for me."

Wahlberg {{was the first}} actor to sign on as a star of the film during its early stages of development. He agreed to portray Luttrell after reading Peter Berg's script. Wahlberg chose not to read Luttrell's book Lone Survivor during production to avoid arguments with Berg over events and details that were {{left out in the}} book. [...] "The problem when adapting a piece of material like that is that you always feel like something is missing", he explained. [...] "I wanted to come at it from this perspective." [...] Of Wahlberg's portrayal, Luttrell stated, [...] "Wahlberg is a consummate professional, and he's <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>actor.</b> It was a little strange watching somebody trying to play me, but we talked about it and I knew it would turn out great. I was more worried about the other guys because they’re not around to speak for themselves." [...] Wahlberg has since cited Lone Survivor as his favorite film role as an actor and producer: [...] "This is the best working experience I’ve ever had, under the toughest conditions. I remember early on as an actor, you worked a long, hard day, but you did something you felt was special, and that car ride home you couldn’t stop thinking about it. I had that feeling every day on this movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Following his {{historic}} third Oscar win {{there was}} much debate about Day-Lewis's standing among the <b>greatest</b> <b>actors</b> {{in the history of}} cinema. Joe Queenan in The Guardian stated, [...] "Arguing whether Daniel Day-Lewis is <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>actor</b> than Laurence Olivier, or Richard Burton, or Marlon Brando, is like arguing whether Messi is more talented than Pelé, whether Napoleon Bonaparte edges out Alexander the <b>Great</b> as <b>a</b> military genius." [...] Day-Lewis himself when asked {{what it was like to}} be [...] "the world's greatest actor", responded [...] "It's daft isn't it?. It changes all the time". Shortly after winning the Oscar for Lincoln, Day-Lewis announced he would be taking a break from acting, retreating back to his Georgian farmhouse in County Wicklow for the next five years, before making another film.|$|R

("Let me state at once, in clearest unmistakable terms, that I have never known of, or seen, or heard, <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>actor</b> than was Irving.") George Bernard Shaw, at the time a theatre critic who was jealous of Irving's connection to Ellen Terry (whom Shaw himself wanted in his own plays), conceded Irving's genius after Irving died.|$|R

500|$|In his {{decade in}} charge of the National, Olivier acted in {{thirteen}} plays and directed eight. Several of the roles he played were minor characters, including a crazed butler in Feydeau's A Flea in Her Ear and a pompous solicitor in Maugham's Home and Beauty; the vulgar soldier Captain Brazen in Farquhar's 1706 comedy The Recruiting Officer was a larger role but not the leading one. Apart from his Astrov in the Uncle Vanya, familiar from Chichester, his first leading role for the National was Othello, directed by Dexter in 1964. The production was a box-office success and was revived regularly over the next five seasons. His performance divided opinion. Most of the reviewers and theatrical colleagues praised it highly; Franco Zeffirelli called it [...] "an anthology of everything that has been discovered about acting in the past three centuries." [...] Dissenting voices included The Sunday Telegraph, which called it [...] "the kind of bad acting of which only <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>actor</b> is capable... near the frontiers of self-parody"; the director Jonathan Miller thought it [...] "a condescending view of an Afro Caribbean person". The burden of playing this demanding part {{at the same time as}} managing the new company and planning for the move to the new theatre took its toll on Olivier. To add to his load, he felt obliged to take over as Solness in The Master Builder when the ailing Redgrave withdrew from the role in November 1964. For the first time Olivier began to suffer from stage fright, which plagued him for several years. The National Theatre production of Othello was released as a film in 1965, which earned four Academy Award nominations, including another for Best Actor for Olivier.|$|E
