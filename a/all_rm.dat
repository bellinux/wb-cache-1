We tested the capacity of this live-attenuated virus to protect RMs against pathogenic, heterologous SIVsmE 660 challenges. Three groups of four RM were inoculated with Rev-Ind Nef¯SIV and compared. Group 1 was inoculated 8 years prior and again 15 months before low dose intrarectal challenges with SIVsmE 660. Group 2 animals were inoculated with Rev-Ind Nef¯SIV at 15 months and Group 3 at 2 weeks prior to the SIVsmE 660 challenges, respectively. Group 4 served as unvaccinated controls. <b>All</b> <b>RMs</b> underwent repeated weekly low-dose intrarectal challenges with SIVsmE 660. Surprisingly, <b>all</b> <b>RMs</b> with acute live-attenuated virus infection (Group 3) became superinfected with the challenge virus, in contrast to the two other vaccine groups (Groups 1 and 2) (P= 0. 006 for each) and controls (Group 4) (P= 0. 022). Gene expression analysis showed significant upregulation of innate immune response-related chemokines and their receptors, most notably CCR 5 in Group 3 animals during acute infection with Rev-Ind Nef¯SIV.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>All</b> seed <b>rms</b> in six EU {{countries}} were surveyed in May 1999 {{to determine how}} seed development budgets were distributed across three crop development technologies and the eÚects {{of the type of}} technology in use on employment, sales and exports. The results indicate that an evaluation of the economic consequences of an emergent technology such as genetic engineering should both consider the eÚect of competitive alternative technologies and survey <b>all</b> <b>rms</b> within the sector, rather than focusing on a subset of high technology rms. Only about 10 % of the combined 1999 research budget of European seed rms was spent on genetic engineering, although this should increase to about 15 % by 2002. Alternative technologies to develop new plant varieties, such as conventional plant breeding and conventional breeding combined with techniques that were developed for genetic engineering, are considerably more important economically. In fact, there is no diÚerence in expected employment and sales per development employee by the type of technology in use, while export rates are highest among rms that combine conventional plant breeding with advanced techniques...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Cocycles of Zm-actions on compact metric spaces {{provide a}} means for {{constructing}} Rm-actions or flows, called suspension flows. It is known that <b>all</b> <b>Rm</b> flows with a free dense orbit have an almost one-to-one extension which is a sus-pension flow. In this paper we investigate when the space for a suspension flow depends only on the given Zm-action {{and not on the}} actual cocycle. The iden-tity map I of Rm determines perhaps the simplest cocycle for any Zm-action. We introduce invertible cocycles, and show that they produce the same space as the cocycle determined by the identity map I. The main result, Theorem 5. 2, estab-lishes an integration test for invertibility using piecewise linear maps and related topological ideas. Finally, it applies to the known methods for modeling Rm flows as suspensions and leads to refinements of these results. 1...|$|E

40|$|Firms {{routinely}} {{engage in}} relationship marketing (RM) {{efforts to improve}} their relationships with business partners, and extant research has documented the effectiveness of various RM strategies. According to the perspective proposed in this article, as customers migrate through different relationship states over time, not <b>all</b> <b>RM</b> strategies are equally effective, so {{it is possible to}} identify the most effective RM strategies given customers’ states. The authors apply a multivariate hidden Markov model to a six-year longitudinal data set of 552 business-to-business relationships maintained by a Fortune 500 firm. The analysis identifies four latent buyer–seller relationship states, according to each customer’s level of commitment, trust, dependence, and relational norms, and it parsimoniously captures customers’ migration across relationship states through three positive (exploration, endowment, recovery) and two negative (neglect, betrayal) migration mechanisms. The most effective RM strategies across migration paths can help firms promote customer migration to higher performance states and prevent deterioration to poorer ones. A counterfactual elasticity analysis compares the relative importance of different migration strategies at various relationship stages. This research thus moves beyond extant RM literature by focusing on the differential effectiveness of RM strategies across relationship states, and it provides managerial guidance regarding efficient, dynamic resource allocations.

40|$|The oxidn. {{of diesel}} soot and {{amorphous}} carbon black, {{in the presence}} of a copper-vanadium-potassium catalyst supported on -alumina, was studied to investigate the influence of the carbon/catalyst initial mass ratio, Rm, on the carbon reactivity. A differential flow reactor was employed to perform kinetic tests. The progress of the catalytic combustion process was followed measuring the concns. of carbon oxides in the product stream at the reactor outlet with online NDIR analyzers. Exptl. results conform to those obtained while operating at relatively low values of Rm for what concerns the influence of oxygen partial pressure and temp. Furthermore, burn-off temps. {{in the presence of}} the catalyst were lowered by ca. 300 K, and correspondingly, the apparent activation energy for the catalytic oxidn. was found to be less than half with respect to the uncatalyzed combustion. A strong influence of Rm on the evolution with time of the combustion process was experienced. Specifically, time profiles of reactivity obtained when Rm was higher than 0. 1 show a max. whose amplitude increases as Rm increases. This behavior was related to the segregation of a more-or-less large fraction of the total carbon. Following such findings, a kinetic model for carbon catalytic oxidn. was proposed. It is based on the assumption that different carbon portions enter the reaction zone at different times. Model parameters were estd. by a numerical code properly adapted.

40|$|Background/Aim. Rhabdomyolysis (RM) is {{potentially}} lethal syndrome, {{but there are}} no enough published data on its frequency and characteristics in acute poisonings. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the causes and severity of RM in acute poisonings. Methods. Patients hospital charts were retrospectively screened during a one-year period in order to identify patients with RM among 656 patients treated due to acute poisonings with different agents. All the patients with RM were selected. Entrance criterion was the value of creatine kinase (CK) over 250 U/L. The severity of RM was assessed according to the Poison Severity Score. The patients were divided into three groups: the first one with mild RM (CK from 250 to 1, 500 U/L), the second with moderate RM (CK from 1, 500 to 10, 000 U/L) and the third with severe RM (CK greater than 10, 000 U/L). Results. RM occurred in 125 (19 %) of the patients with acute poisonings. It was mainly mild (61 %), or moderate (36 %), and only in 3 % of the patients was severe RM. The incidence of RM was the highest in poisonings with opiates (41 %), pesticides (38 %), neuroleptics (26 %), anticonvulsants (26 %), ethyl alcohol (20 %), and gases (19 %). Psychotropic agents were the most common causes of poisoning, and consequently of RM. Fatal outcomes were registered in 32 (25. 60 %) of <b>all</b> <b>RM</b> patients. The incidence of fatal outcomes in poisonings with mild, moderate and severe RM was 19. 73 %, 31. 11 % and 75 %, respectively. Conclusion. RM syndrome occurs at a relatively high rate in acute poisonings. Although agent’s toxicity is crucial for the outcome, severe RM and its complications may significantly influence the clinical course and prognosis of poisoning. Routine analysis of CK, as a relevant marker for RM may indicate the development of RM in acute poisoning and initiate prompt therapeutic measures in preventing acute renal failure as the most frequent consequence of extensive rhabdomyolysis...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Recurrent {{miscarriage}} (RM) is {{a complex}} clinical problem, concerning a heterogeneous group of women trying to conceive. Patients often do not receive evidence-based care, which in daily practice results in unnecessary and expensive diagnostic tests and treatment. In 2007, the Dutch guideline on RM was thoroughly revised. Unfortunately guidelines are not self-implementing and during measurement {{of the quality of}} care, guideline adherence appeared to be poor. Based on this measurement and on identified barriers for guideline adherence in RM, a strategy for implementation of the new guideline was developed and applied in two hospitals. The aim of this thesis is to investigate adherence to the revised guideline on RM, after introduction of the implementation strategy in the two participating hospitals. Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed in two Departments of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (AMC and OLVG), after introduction of the implementation strategy. <b>All</b> <b>RM</b> patients that visited the two participating hospitals between March 2009 and December 2009 were included. Data about the care they received were acquired from their medical records. The quality of care was measured with the guideline-based quality indicators for RM. Guideline adherence after the introduction of the strategy was compared to the guideline adherence in the two hospitals prior to introduction of the strategy. Results 140 women with RM were included. Selective karyotyping showed an improvement from 57. 2 % to 79. 1 % (p= 0. 000) and selective thrombophilia screening showed an improved from 38. 9 % to 78. 4 % (p= 0. 000). The quality indicators “perform anti-phospholipid antibody screening in all patients” and “determine random homocystein in all patients” showed an increase in adherence of 11. 9 % (p= 0. 064) and 12. 4 % (p= 0. 005) respectively. Overall, improvement of care was better at the AMC than at the OLVG. None of the indicators showed a significantly lower adherence after the strategy was introduced. Conclusion Introduction of the implementation package has contributed to a higher adherence of the guideline RM. Further measurement will take place in other hospitals where the strategy was introduced. A process evaluation will take place to determine which parts of the strategy are most effective. The results so far are promising for future dissemination and use of the strategy to improve care in RM. ...|$|E

This paper aims at providing a ra- tionale for such a large extent of collaboration ties among complementors. To this end, we analyze a game in which the two producers of a certain component have the possibility to form pairwise collaboration ties with each of the two producers of a complementary component. Once ties are formed, each of the four rms de- cides how much to invest in improving the quality of the match with each possible complementor, under the assumption that a rm with a collaboration link with a complementor puts some weight on the complementor s pro t when making invest- ment decisions. Once investment choices have taken place, <b>all</b> <b>rms</b> choose prices for their respective components in a noncooperative manner. In equilibrium, rms end up forming as many collaboration ties as it is possible, although they would all prefer a scenario where collaboration were forbidden.

We show that the result that collaboration is ine¢ cient for rms and society does not depend on whether collaboration ties are formed in an exclusive manner: in fact, exclusivity would only worsen the situation. ...|$|R
