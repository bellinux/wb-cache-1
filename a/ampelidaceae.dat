50|$|The Vitaceae are {{a family}} of {{dicotyledonous}} flowering plants, with 14 genera and ca 910 known species, including the grapevine and Virginia creeper. The family name {{is derived from the}} genus Vitis. The name sometimes appears as Vitidaceae, but Vitaceae is a conserved name and therefore has priority over both Vitidaceae and another name sometimes found in the older literature, <b>Ampelidaceae.</b> In the APG III system (2009) onwards, the family is placed in its own order, Vitales. Molecular phylogenetic studies place the Vitales as the most basal clade in the rosids.|$|E
