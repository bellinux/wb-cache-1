50|$|For {{properties}} 4 and 5, first {{observe that}} any {{two of the}} three Johnson circles are interchanged by the reflection in the line connecting H and their 2-wise intersection (or in their common tangent at H if these points should coincide), and this reflection also interchanges the two vertices of the <b>anticomplementary</b> triangle lying on these circles. The 2-wise intersection point therefore is the midpoint of a side of the <b>anticomplementary</b> triangle, and H lies on the perpendicular bisector of this side. Now the midpoints of the sides of any triangle are the images of its vertices by a homothety with factor −½, centered at the barycenter of the triangle. Applied to the <b>anticomplementary</b> triangle, which is itself obtained from the Johnson triangle by a homothety with factor 2, it follows from composition of homotheties that the reference triangle is homothetic to the Johnson triangle by a factor −1. Since such a homothety is a congruence, this gives property 5, and also the Johnson circles theorem since congruent triangles have circumscribed circles of equal radius.|$|E

Because heat inactivation of endogenous C 1 {{is an essential part of}} the procedure, the <b>anticomplementary</b> activity of normal sera as a function of time of heating at 56 °C was examined.

Comparison of the <b>anticomplementary</b> activity of control (n = 11) and pathological sera (n = 19) at two arbitrarily chosen time intervals (30 and 60 min) nevertheless disclosed significant differences, which were greatest after the longer heating time.

40|$|The work {{recorded}} above {{has served}} to corroborate {{the observations of}} other writers, notably of Noguchi, that in many human sera, if not in all, there develop, on standing, <b>anticomplementary</b> bodies which are delicately thermolabile, being inactivated by heating to 56 ° C. for fifteen to twenty minutes. It has appeared that these bodies may occasionally be present in sera which, after heating, may develop the thermostable <b>anticomplementary</b> body referred to by other authors. It has become evident also that the speed of development of the thermolabile <b>anticomplementary</b> body in different sera is subject to much variation. The thermolabile body appears as the complement disappears. The question arises whether the thermolabile <b>anticomplementary</b> body may not be originally present in the serum, temporarily masked by the native complement. This would seem improbable {{from the fact that}} titration has shown that 0. 1 and 0. 2 cubic centimeter of the inhibiting serum will often inhibit as much as 0. 6 cubic centimeter of fresh guinea-pig complement, a quantity superior to the amount of complement present originally in the antihemolytic serum. It seems, therefore, that the <b>anticomplementary</b> body must actually be formed in the serum during the period of preservation. The thermolabile antihemolytic body studied by us is like the thermostabile body investigated by Noguchi, in that it inhibits alien as well as homologous complement; it is unlike the thermostabile body, however, in that it cannot be absorbed from serum by digestion with red cells, nor does it render the treated cells more resistant to hemolysis. The thermolabile body may be removed from inhibiting sera by precipitating the globulins. A solution of the glotmiins then manifests a thermolabile <b>anticomplementary</b> action. No relationship between a clinical condition and the appearance of these bodies in the sera, has been found.

40|$|Cobra venom factor (CoF), the <b>anticomplementary</b> {{protein in}} Naja naja cobra venom, is usually {{purified}} by sequential ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography.

BPB treatment does not alter the <b>anticomplementary</b> activity of CoF. In vivo experiments utilizing intratracheal injections of control and BPB-treated CoF, as well as pure phospholipase A 2, revealed that contaminating phospholipase A 2, and not the <b>anticomplementary</b> protein, was responsible for the observed acute neutrophil-associated lung injury. However, phospholipase A 2 had no effect on the hypotensive and thrombocytopenic effects of CoF infected intravenously into rabbits.

40|$|Uniform salt {{forms of}} {{endotoxic}} lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and free lipid A showing distinct {{differences in their}} <b>anticomplementary</b> activity, {{as well as a}} nontoxic LPS, are used in a new approach of studying the role of complement in endotoxin shock.

An early depression occurred within 10 min after injection, and a late one developed more gradually, with lowest values at 6 to 9 h. The early depression represents a direct interaction of LPS with complement.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Extracts {{from the}} Caucasian species of comfrey – Symphytum asperum and S. caucasicum {{have been used}} in folk {{medicine}} in the treatment of some kinds of disorders, mainly fractures and wounds. The aforenamed extracts contain allantoin, claimed to be a cell proliferation-stimulating agent responsible for the wound-healing properties of Symphytum, and, on the other hand, hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids which strongly restrict internal use of comfrey extracts. In the present investigation, we obtained allantoin- and toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids-free composition containing crude polysaccharides and novel biopolymer from S. asperum roots – poly[3 -(3, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl) glyceric acid] (PDGA), and attempted to appraise its pharmacological properties in in vitro (<b>anticomplementary</b> and antioxidant assays) and in vivo experiments (mouse excisional wound and skin burn models). PDGA exhibited marked antioxidant and <b>anticomplementary</b> activity in con-trast with polysaccharides, which displayed no detectable <b>anticomplementary</b> and antioxidant efficacy. Be-sides, ointment, containing 2. 5 % crude polysaccharides and PDGA was found to have pronounced wound-healing properties, by efficacy not yielding to 2. 5 % allantoin ointment. The obtained results allow assuming with high degree of reliability that wound healing activity of comfrey preparations could be associated not only with allantoin but also with PDGA. © 2009 Bull.

40|$|Fucoidan is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of the human complement system whose activity is mediated through interactions with certain proteins belonging to the classical pathway, particularly the protein C 4.

40|$|The {{ability of}} heparin {{glycosaminoglycan}} to prevent {{formation of the}} properdin-stabilized amplification C 3 convertase is independent of antithrombin binding activity and requires substitution of the amino sugar and a degree of oxygen (O) -sulfation which {{could be on the}} uronic acid or the amino sugar. Preparations of heparin glycosaminoglycan isolated by different techniques from different species (rat, human, and porcine) exhibited an equivalent capacity to inhibit generation of the amplification C 3 convertase. Hyaluronic acid, which is devoid of O-sulfation, had no inhibitory activity; chondroitin 4 -sulfate of rat and whale origins, chondroitin 6 -sulfate of rat and shark origins, and dermatan sulfate from porcine skin are O-sulfated on the galactosamine and had minimal activity. Porcine heparin glycosaminoglycan, isolated on the basis of affinity for antithrombin III, had no greater <b>anticomplementary</b> activity than porcine glycosaminoglycan, which failed to bind antithrombin III and had essentially no anticoagulant activity. Nitrogen (N) -desulfation of porcine heparin reduced <b>anticomplementary</b> activity {{to the level of the}} other sulfated mucopolysaccharides, and both N-resulfation and N-acetylation restored the original activities, thereby indicating a requirement for N-substitution, but not N-sulfation.
