40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{theoretically}} analyze and empirically test the business value of firm web visibility, including its relationship to advertising efficiency and long-term financial performance (i. e. shareholder value). Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual framework is established to analyze firm value of web visibility through its market effects. Hypotheses on the associations between firm web visibility and advertising efficiency and shareholder value are tested by cross-sectional analysis of 1, 331 firms in six industries and four industry sectors. The authors control for several firm- and industry-level factors. Findings: The results consistently support the two hypotheses, i. e., first, a positive and significant relationship between firm web visibility and advertising efficiency; and second, a positive and significant relationship between firm web visibility and shareholder value. Practical implications: In addition to increasing web traffic, firm web visibility has business value and helps to enhance advertising efficiency and shareholder value. Managers can use the web references as a valuable tool for marketing success when the use of traditional <b>advertising</b> reaches <b>saturation.</b> Managers should actively monitor and use web visibility as a web management measure in practice. Originality/value: This research provides convincing evidence to support both short-term and long-term business value of web visibility and suggests that web visibility be recognized and managed as a market-based asset. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R

But the association between advertising and videogames is not new at all, and we can find its origins if we go back in time {{to the beginning of the}} eighties. Nevertheless, this phenomenon has frequently been analyzed though a perspective based in entertainment or leisure, and only recently it has been studied under an advertising vision. Therefore, in the following investigation I will try to find and elaborate a proper definition to the concept, as well as a classification to the field of advergaming. The main goal will be to demonstrate the importance that advergaming has reached in comparison with the rest of media and its trend as a social tool for any kind of brands all over the world...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This Project shows {{characteristics}} of Below the Line (BTL) advertising. It {{begins with the}} explanation of three important concepts to better understand this kind of advertising: marketing, communication and advertising. First of all, marketing is a process which defines the actions to broadcast the message of a company. Secondly, communication is responsible for broadcast these messages and it’s beneficial when it’s consistent and useful. Finally, advertising {{is the place where}} the foregoing is captured. It should be aimed at the audience the company wants to have or maintain. Above the Line (ATL) and Below the Line techniques are explained to compare their general characteristics later. Above the line advertising consists of television, cinema, radio, print and outdoor advertising. Advertiser sends messages through mass media. On the other hand, BTL sales promotion uses different methods of advertising, which encourage customers to purchase. It may include a lot of activities such as direct marketing, sponsorship, sales promotion, telemarketing, etc. Despite of the fact that BTL is usually joined to ATL, what makes it different is that the first group of techniques, not only intend to draw attention but establish a relationship with the customer. In this way, current <b>advertising</b> <b>saturation</b> problems are avoided and the memory of an ad and the brand image are strengthened. This kind of advertising has several advantages over ATL like its low cost, versatility, high segmentation, direct contact with customers and Publicity, among others. For these reasons, it has a greatest investment; especially in direct mailing, phone marketing and point-of-sale advertising, despite the current crisis and the advertising budget cut. The future of BTL focuses on new technologies, social awareness and a more personal advertising. Grado en Administración y Dirección de Empresa...|$|E
40|$|In today's society, {{consumers}} get {{in touch}} with hundreds of advertising messages a day from companies. It is up to the consumer to choose the messages they want to listen to and ignore the ones they want. Today, there is an <b>advertising</b> <b>saturation</b> and this has implications for both producers and consumer. Companies must be innovative and come with fresh ideas to get us consumers to pay attention to their particular message.  It is through the marketing that companies have an opportunity to spread their message. The challenge is to make themselves visible to consumers and make them aware of their message. This challenge means that companies need to know everything and then some of his audience. A market survey is a good tool to meet this challenge. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate what factors influence consumer choice of conference facilities. The company that is the focus of this investigation is Visit Karlstad, who is a company that’s providing conference services for businesses and organizations. The conference industry is a part of the experience industry and conference facilities have in pace with todays increased focus on experiences. Companies need to invest more in particular on activities to attract consumers. The advertising is now more focused on the experiences and events, and many researchers argue that there are experiences that attract consumers to consume today. Today's tough advertising climate means that firms are facing greater challenges to reach out with their message.  A quantitative study in the form of a survey was the basis for this thesis. Respondents to the survey have been conferences buyers from all over Sweden. The results from the survey show that the determining factors in the choice of the conference are: the location, good communications, price, standard of the facility, the environment and the range of activities available. These are factors that are critical to the overall impression of the conference center and conference stay...|$|E
5000|$|During the Great Depression, Sam and Albert Abrams, chemists and {{entrepreneurs}} from Brooklyn, took over an ailing boot polish maker, the Knomark Manufacturing Company of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In 1938 they purchased the Esquire brand. After a <b>saturation</b> <b>advertising</b> campaign in 1944, the company became the best selling shoe polish manufacturer in the US. A 1951 advertising campaign featured the singer and television star Kate Smith. In the late 1950s, they sold the Esquire brand and the 1914-built Esquire Building on 330 Wythe Avenue in Brooklyn. In 1957, Revlon acquired the Esquire brand which made {{annual sales of}} 15 million dollars. Revlon sold the Esquire shoe polish brand and other Esquire product brands in 1969. The Sara Lee company purchased the Esquire brand in 1987, which discontinued it in favor of their Kiwi brand. In 1994, Papercraft Corp. of Pittsburgh purchased the Esquire brand from Sara Lee.|$|R
40|$|Recent United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} have undermined {{the viability of}} campaign public financing systems, a vital tool for fighting political corruption. First, Citizens United v. FEC allowed privately financed candidates and independent groups to spend unlimited amounts of money on campaigning. Publicly financed candidates now risk being vastly outspent. Second, Arizona Free Enterprise Club’s Freedom PAC v. Bennett invalidated a proportional fund matching system whereby privately financed candidates’ or independent groups’ spending triggered funds to publicly funded candidates. These decisions effectuate a libertarian speech doctrine: all speakers, individual or corporate, must be absolutely unburdened. To comply with this approach, public financing must be tailored to reduce its monetary correlation with, and corresponding burden on, privately funded speech. This Article proposes matching broadcast advertising access costs as a measured solution. The proposed system does not burden privately funded speech, and it increases media availability: if a privately financed candidate or independent group purchases advertising time, the publicly financed candidate is provided funds to purchase equivalent time. Matching access costs reduces any burden on speakers while importing First Amendment jurisprudence and telecommunications law to support the constitutionality of this system. These laws recognize the First Amendment rights of the electorate, the problem of political <b>advertising</b> market <b>saturation,</b> and the values of an informed citizenry. Essential for democracy is an informed, engaged, and participating citizenry. Matching broadcast access costs increases available information, comports with th...|$|R

5000|$|Worthington's {{commercials}} {{were seen}} on every television channel in Los Angeles throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, mostly through <b>saturation</b> <b>advertising</b> during the overnight hours. (It was also played in Ontario Canada) The commercials would {{be accompanied by}} a jingle set to the tune of a United States Air Force drinking song, with the lyrics re-written to the refrain of [...] "If you want a car or truck, go see Cal, if you want to save a buck, go see Cal;" [...] following this were several different versions of the lyrics, such as [...] "Give a new car to your wife, she will love you all your life" [...] or [...] "I will stand upon my head until my ears are turning red," [...] and ending with [...] "Go see Cal, Go see Cal, Go see Cal". When the idea of a jingle was first pitched to him, it was conceptualized as slow with a big roll up of drums; Worthington disagreed and felt the song should be fast and wrote the lyrics and recorded the song himself. The jingle was successful. In the years following, Worthington discovered that there were children who thought that his name was [...] "Go see Cal." ...|$|R

Barnardos sees some of the grim realities of problem drinking and its impact on children and young people: ■ The effects of being brought up in a family where a high proportion of the family’s income is spent on alcohol leads to material deprivation. The children may suffer acute child poverty as a result and this may be manifest in terms of lack of a proper diet, lack of school books, clothes and toys. ■ One or both parents are often drunk in front of the child, their friends and neighbours. ■ A parent is unable to get up in the morning to get the child ready for school. ■ A child or young person is addicted to alcohol while still in their teens. ■ Children can be victims of conflict, marital breakdown and parental separation. ■ Children can be both witnesses and victims of alcohol-related domestic violence in the home. ■ Children can become engaged in inappropriate, ill-informed and possibly involuntary sexual activity. ■ Children can become either victims or perpetrators of violent assaults...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} an {{economic}} {{rationale for the}} following stylized fact: Web-based firms spend profligately on advertising and marketing and usually lose money. Our rationale {{is based on the}} winner-take-all structure of high fixed cost, low marginal cost, markets for information goods. This market structure ensures that market participation and investment policy are highly stochastic. Moreover, if a firm chooses to participate in a Web market, it is optimal to act very aggressively through <b>saturation</b> <b>advertising.</b> Although increases in advertising costs reduce the probability of entry, once the decision to enter is made, firm strategies are insensitive to advertising price. Consistent with empirical studies of the profitability of internet firms (Hand, 2001), our model predicts returns that are highly positively skewed, that is, even the firms that survive the competition for market position have a small chance of huge gains combined with a large probability of very modest returns. In dynamic competition, firms weakened by early rounds are less likely to challenge in subsequent rounds. However, when a challenge is attempted, it is always aggressive. In addition, because large expenditures in the first period produce valuable strategic real options in later periods, which are treated as expenses using traditional accounting methodology, the financial valuation of Internet firms may actually be negatively related to performance when using standard accounting measures of profitability that fail to capitalize these strategic real options...|$|R
40|$|Prescription drug {{advertisements}} {{which appeared}} in two leading American medical journals in 1972, 1977 and 1982 were analyzed to discover possible trends in advertising. The 5016 ads examined showed that ads for the diuretic-cardiovasculars, especially the beta-adrenergic blocking agents and the slow channel inhibitors, {{as well as the}} analgesics, had increased, while ads for the anti-infectives and tranquilizers had diminished. The average amount of space allocated for each ad had increased. On the average, most ads (69 %) depicted neither male nor female patients in their graphics, and a trend of increased neutrality was observed. When the hormones were excluded, an average of 21 % of the ads showed male patients and 10 % showed females. Since a relationship was discerned between the leading drugs advertised and the leading prescriptions filled, it was concluded that advertising does have some effect on the prescribing behavior of practitioners. The findings suggest that great investment in advertising is necessary in order to achieve high levels of sales for such drugs as ValiumÂ® (diazepam) which do not have a clear-cut ameliorative effect on a specific physiological condition. On the other hand, it was suggested that <b>saturation</b> <b>advertising</b> would not significantly enhance the sales of such drugs as DyazideÂ® (triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide) because of its well established therapeutic value in the control of hypertension. Ten advertising companies, on the average, had purchased 67 % of all advertising space and five had purchased almost half (47 %). The same two pharmaceutical companies were among the top five advertisers and the same five were among the top ten for the three years studied. ...|$|R
40|$|Faced {{with the}} {{possible}} sale of our free-to-air state broadcaster Television New Zealand to overseas media interests, this thesis argues a firm case against sale, and sets out to create further public interest and comment. Television is valuable more for its programme content than its ability to raise revenue. Starting with the premise that television has a unique role as a mass communications medium in creating social reality, discussion centres on how ideas of cultural identity, democracy, sovereignty, and national identity are articulated and supported through locally-made, creative and diverse programming; and how this is strengthened in having the state broadcaster take a leading part in setting a high standard in the service provided. The tensions created by economic globalisation of media products are examined, especially in relation to how small nation-states such as New Zealand encounter a deterritorialisation of social identity arising through rapid technological advances and media processes which ignore national state and cultural boundaries. The origin of state television in New Zealand is documented, particular emphasis being given to legislative control, financial performance and the effect that organisational structure has on the content, diversity and standard of programmes scheduled. Maximising the financial performance of TVNZ through <b>saturation</b> <b>advertising</b> is questioned, and the recent polarising debate by politicians, commentators, and the public on the merits or otherwise of state ownership of TVNZ is covered in detail. A comprehensive study of the ABC and SBS in Australia is included, which informs {{an alternative proposal for}} TVNZ based on significant restructuring. This thesis concludes TVNZ should be retained in government ownership, but with TV 1 guided by a charter which moves its prime function away from commercial imperatives. TV 1 should concentrate on developing a broadcasting service dedicated to programmes which contribute a sense of national identity, and which reflect the cultural diversity and aspirations of all New Zealanders. To assist in these goals TV 1 would be publicly funded to provide daily primetime ad-free 'windows' used to schedule programmes in line with its charter. TV 2, and a range of industry mechanisms, would be used to ameliorate the ratio of tax-payer funding...|$|R
40|$|Few could seriously {{claim that}} Australians are not toiling with 'hearts and hands'. Per capita hours worked by Australians are now amongst {{the highest in}} the GECD and there is {{evidence}} that work has intensified for most (see Watson et aI, 2003). There are high levels of temporal, numerical and functional flexibility and corporate profits are booming (ABS, Catalogue 5676. 0, 2005). It is, therefore, unsurprising that the Howard Government's WorkChoices industrial relations reforms have been greeted with widespread antipathy by all but fractions within the business community (Lewis, 2005). The efforts of the, Howard government to prove an impetus for these reforms seems unlikely to accord with the actual working experiences of Australians, many of whom have already traded away conditions and provided employers with considerable flexibility under previous bargaining rounds or individual contracts or through the award simplification process. The $ 50 m. <b>saturation</b> <b>advertising</b> campaign, designed to selI the reforms to the electorate, has had little impact on public sentiment (Humphries, 2005), Nonetheless, the Coalition's slim majority in the Senate means that WorkChoices is likely to proceed into law with few concessions. In recent years the Senate {{has proved to be a}} significant check on the Coalition's more ambitious industrial relations plans, with just 15 out of 56 introduced bills passing into law between 1997 and 2004. The Coalition's remarkable victory in the October 2004 election though has secured a majority in both houses (the first time since 1981, [Singleton, 1996 : 2]) and the Howard Government now claims a mandate to implement wide ranging reforms to industrial relations not seen since the introduction of decentralised wage determination in 1991. Among its other reforms, the Howard Government proposes to replace the 'no disadvantage test' with a new standard against which collective agreements and individual contracts are to be measured, known as the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard (AFPCS). This new standard and its likely impact in Australian Industrial Relations is the subject of this article. We begin our analysis of the AFPCS by placing its introduction in the historical context of the gradual weakening of protective regulation since decentralised bargaining was introduced. Our argument is that the AFPCS is the latest reduction in the steady decline over the last thirteen years of regulation formerly designed to protect wages and conditions from falling. Labor and Coalition governments have both contributed to the dilution of this regulation, although its declining force has been most marked under the Howard government. We contend that, although the steady decline of this regulation has been claimed to stimulate more bargaining by simplifying 'agreement making procedures', it has had adverse implications for procedural and substantive fairness. The AFPCS continues this trend of weakening protective regulation which will only exacerbate existing inequities, especially for the most vulnerable. More particularly, we argue that the impact of the AFPCS must be evaluated in the context of the other introduced reforms, especially the unfair dismissal law exemption. The following analysis also considers the development of the AFPCS in an international context. Prime Minister Howard has asserted that the passage of the WorkChoices reforms will still leave the Australian labour market more regulated than that of the UK and New Zealand. Implicit in this argument is that these are the countries we should be using as benchmarks against which to assess the legislation. So it is important to look at the evidence on the extent of regulation designed to protect wages and conditions in the decentralised bargaining environments of the United Kingdom and New Zealand Drawing together these strands of analysis, the paper concludes that, over time, the AFPCS is likely to result in deleterious bargaining outcomes, particularly for those with little bargaining power in the Australian labour market...|$|R
