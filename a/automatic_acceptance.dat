40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{mapping of}} {{ventricular}} arrhythmias in humans using a minibasket 64 -electrode catheter {{paired with a}} novel automatic mapping system (Rhythmia) has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mapping ventricular arrhythmias and clinical outcomes after ablation using this system. METHODS: Electroanatomic maps for ventricular arrhythmias were obtained during 20 consecutive procedures in 19 patients (12 with ventricular tachycardia [VT] and 2 with ventricular ectopy [VE]). High-density maps were acquired using <b>automatic</b> beat <b>acceptance</b> and <b>automatic</b> system annotation of electrograms. RESULTS: Forty-seven electroanatomic maps (including 3 right ventricular and 9 epicardial maps) were obtained. Left ventricular endocardial mapping by transseptal (n = 13) and/or transaortic (n = 11) access was safe with no complications related to the minibasket catheter. VT substrate maps (n = 14; median 10, 184 points) consistently demonstrated late potentials with high resolution. VT activation maps (n = 25; median 6401 points) obtained by automatic annotation included 7 complete maps (covering ≥ 90 % of the tachycardia cycle length) in 5 patients in whom the entire VT circuit was accurately visualized. VE timing maps (n = 8) successfully localized the origin of VEs in all, with all accepted beats consistent with clinical VEs. Over a median follow-up of 10 months, no arrhythmia recurrence was noted in 75 % after VT ablation and 86 % after VE ablation. CONCLUSION: In this first human experience for ventricular arrhythmias using this system, ultra-high-density maps were created rapidly and safely, with a reliable automatic annotation of VT and consistent recording of abnormal electrograms. Medium-term outcomes after ablation were encouraging. Further larger studies are needed to validate these findings...|$|R

From the religious point of view of the typical Protestant, major changes were underway in terms of a much more personalized religiosity that focused on the individual more than the church or the ceremony. The rationalism of the late 19th century faded away, and there was a new emphasis on the psychology and feeling of the individual, especially in terms of contemplating sinfuness, redemption, and the mysteries and the revelations of Christianity. Pietistic revivals were common among Protestants. Social activities, in education and in opposition to social vices such as slavery, alcoholism and poverty provided new opportunities for social service.

5000|$|Following an {{investigation}} by Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse regarding sexual abuse of students at Chabad schools, in February 2015, a senior Chabad rabbi who is also son of Chabad's chief rabbi in Sydney, was removed as representative of the New York-based organization as {{the fallout from the}} child sex abuse investigation and public hearings. Rabbi Yosef Feldman, the Sydney Yeshivah Center's former director, was dismissed following comments to the Royal Commission suggesting that pedophiles who had refrained from sex crimes for two decades should be treated with leniency. Feldman sparked a [...] "storm of protest" [...] among Jewish leaders, and resigned his post at Yeshiva Center, which houses Chabad. As a result of the investigation and the testimony of victims and rabbinic leaders of Chabad in Australia, Philip Dalidakis, Member of the Victorian Legislative Council for Southern Metropolitan Region, son of a Jewish immigrant, has called on the Prime Minister and Premier to initiate action making the Chabad Yeshiva more accountable. He proposed that financial support from the government be withheld until all leaders who helped cover up abuse resign. He further demanded the production of all reports, letters and emails related to the concealment of abuse, the creation and enforcement of clear, specific rules for Yeshiva leaders {{and the creation of a}} fund to compensate victims. In an open letter to the Jewish community, Dalidakis acknowledged that he was shocked that the Yeshivas had allowed child sexual abuse to take place, had protected the perpetrators and had discouraged victims from reporting crimes to the police and had allowed, even participated in, the harassment and shunning of victims and their families. He added that it is not enough for individual leaders to resign at these particular schools: [...] "The Yeshivah Centre, and the Chabad-Lubavitch movement which controls it, must accept corporate responsibility. They must accept that the abuse that took place was not just a matter of personal failure but also a failure of institutional structure and culture. These must be thoroughly reformed. There must be an end to secrecy, to concealment, and to <b>automatic</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the actions of figures of authority. There must be new values, and new rules to put those values into practice, before trust can be restored." [...] Manny Waks, community activist who founded Tzedek, an organization dedicated to protecting abuse victims and preventing abuse, is now working to establish a global inquiry into sexual abuse in the Jewish community, using the Royal Commission as a model.|$|E

The second chapter analyses attitudes and positions of Czech political representation as a reaction on internationally important documents, attitudes and negotiations. The third and fourth chapter discuss the basic drivers that have impacts on Czech domestic political discussion on the field of climate change and its consequences on the international scene. These are analyzed on the level of three main political subjects: the Government reflects the matter in a general context, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacts on it mostly on the conceptual level in connection with other foreign policy matters, and the Ministry of Environment takes most responsibility as a crucial organization, which works on documents and concrete actions. The thesis also contains an analysis of further domestic subjects (organizations or individuals) that influence the discussion about climate change. The aim of the thesis is to analyze attitudes of Czech political representation on the field of climate change problems, and to analyze specifically the question, whether the attitudes are determined by a passive approach (in the sense of <b>automatic</b> <b>acceptance</b> of international obligations) or by an active approach, when the Czech republic itself has a need to reflect the problems from the normative point of view...|$|E
40|$|Jurors are {{vulnerable}} to an array of cognitive biases that can result in an over-belief of confession evidence.

Second, to test the capacity of a hypothesis disconfirmation intervention to enhance sensitivity to inconsistencies by encouraging mock jurors to more critically evaluate confession evidence. The online study followed a 2 (confession strength: weak, strong) x 3 (hypothesis disconfirmation: pre-confession, post-confession, control) between-subjects design. Participants read a police report detailing the facts of a crime and a signed confession statement (either weak and inconsistent with the police report, or strong and consistent). Participants in hypothesis disconfirmation conditions listed up to 10 reasons why someone might falsely confess. Confession strength had a significant main effect on perceived consistency of confession evidence (p. 05). It seems, mock jurors were sufficiently sensitive to inconsistencies in the confession evidence, leaving little room for the hypothesis disconfirmation to have any effect. Before hypothesis disconfirmation is labelled as an ineffective technique for encouraging jurors to more critically evaluate confession evidence, its efficacy should first be tested in cases where jurors’ over-belief in confession evidence is more pronounced...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the World Wide Web (WWW) {{has become}} a popular {{platform}} for system development. There are several factors that make Web-development special. There is {{a large number of}} quality requirements in the Web-based system. Web projects involve people with a diverse background, such as technical people with background in programming and non-technical people with background in graphical design. In addition, the Web-based system are often not developed separately, but is integrating existing subsystems. The time-to-marked requirement is strong. Web-based system must tolerate errors and abnormal situations caused by internal component failure or user mistakes. Therefore, robustness {{is considered to be a}} critical factor for Web-based systems. Building a robust Web-based system is never an easy task. Furthermore, the end users of Web-based systems have different backgounds. Many have knowledge of the Web, others have little or no knowledge of the Web. Since Web-systems are used by people with a rather diverse background, it is important that the Web-based systems must have error tolerance and ability to survive due to user mistake. The main focus of this project is analyzing robustness of Web-based system. In order to analyze robustness of Web-based system, it is necessary to carry out a robustness assessment. Assessment methods are used to evaluate the robustness and give an estimating of the system's robustness. Further, robustness testing of a Web-based system has to be performed to get an idea of the system's current robustness. The result of estimating and test result will also be discussed, compared and evaluated.

40|$|Human {{communication}} {{rests on}} a tension between the goals of communicators and audiences. As {{a result of this}} tension, communicators and audiences alike have developed increasingly sophisticated skills to fulfill their intentions both toward and despite each other. It has been proposed (e. g. by Sperber, 2000) that these adaptive skills have in turn evolved into cognitive modules, and driven the evolution of communication. I discuss how persuasive communication takes advantage of the functions of communication, adapts to an evolving communicative environment, and {{plays an important role in}} the evolution of communication. 1 The dual function of communication In the words of Sperber (2001, pg. 9 2), the “epistemic norms implicit in the process of communication are to a limited but interesting extent at odds with the very function of communication. ” The function of communication is two-fold: to the audience, it is a means of acquiring relevant information; to the communicator, it is a means of affecting the beliefs and other attitudes of the audience. I will start by illustrating how these goals may conflict. To the audience, communication is often a more efficient means than direct perception, indeed sometimes the only means, to obtain relevant information. This information-gathering function seems to be reflected in a lack of focus by young children on the source of new information, and their <b>automatic</b> <b>acceptance</b> of communicated information that is compatible with what they know and is not overtly marked as a case of pretense. Harris (2002) discusses several studies which suggest that children, and to some extent adults, do not keep track of whether they acquired information first-hand, via direct perception, or second-hand, via communication. This failure might be seen as potentially detrimental and counteradaptive, but may also indicate that because both types of source are, at least initially, equally trustworthy, the nature of the source is irrelevant to young * I wish to thank Deirdre Wilson for her continued and unwavering support in general, as well as her many crucial comments on this paper.

40|$|Higher {{education}} systems {{in developing countries}} have mixed results in satisfying their nations’ labour market requirements, and community needs and expectations. Oman, {{a member of the}} Gulf Country Council (GCC), sustained the rapid economic development that has featured within the region over the past three decades. However, a contentious issue for the GCC, including Oman, is the provision of higher education qualifications sufficient for graduates to compete successfully in local labour markets dominated by experienced expatriates. This study explores the factors contributing to high unemployment for the mass communications graduates of Oman’s principal educational facility, Sultan Qaboos University (SQU). Semi-structured interviews with graduates, students and their parents, university and government representatives and public and private employers have revealed a range of views about the employability of the graduates and the university course which sought to prepare them for the labour market. The analysis of the interview data revealed that conventional human capital themes failed to account for the range of views about the effects of the course on graduate employability. Until a decade ago, human capital principles that value years of learning served Oman well as it provided sufficient educational capacity to deliver graduates for its expanding public services. However, when the country’s burgeoning public sector ceased the <b>automatic</b> <b>acceptance</b> of SQU graduates, later cohorts from mass communications courses were unable to source work in Oman’s small private sector mass media industry. The findings from the study were that traditional human capital accumulation is insufficient to deliver jobs; the human risk capital is too high. Risk factors for mass communications students include course admission, curriculum content and delivery, language fluency and technology. Further, employer perceptions of the mass communications qualification and of graduates’ commitment to a work ethic were barriers to employment. A significant contribution of the research is the recognition that the framework of educational practices, associated with what has been termed social capital, provides an alternative and more constructive means of analysis the data. The findings of the research point to the need for a university in a country such as Oman to expand its educational responsibility by taking on a social capital curriculum whose principal feature is the establishment of communicative links between local communities, the university and workplaces. A social capital curriculum, increasingly pursued as best practice for developed countries, can deliver work ready graduates acceptable to employers. Valid for GCC and wider use, a model of the capital theory elements, processes and risks is included in this comparative study...|$|E
40|$|Zaradi globalizacije so prevzemi postali del vsakdanje poslovne prakse. Večina teorij predvideva pozitivne učinke, saj se poveča učinkovitost poslovanja podjetja, doseže sinergija v ekonomiji obsega, kar je posledica novih kombinacij prej ločenih podjetij ali zmanjševanja stroškov. Prevzemno podjetje pridobi določen delež lastninskih pravic (delež delnic) v prevzetem podjetju, kar mu zagotavlja kontrolni delež za odločilno vplivanje na poslovanje prevzetega podjetja. Katerokoli obliko prevzema je mogoče opraviti s plačili v denarju, z zadolžitvijo podjetja, z zamenjavo za delnice ali druge vrednostne papirje. O združitvi podjetij govorimo, kadar iz dveh ali več podjetij nastane eno samo. Izvedena mora biti v skladu z obstoječo zakonodajo. Znotraj združitev ločimo spojitve in pripojitve. Po uspešno opravljenem prevzemu po navadi pride tudi do združitve podjetij. Prevzemi in združitve vselej prinašajo spremembe in drugačne pristope k opravljanju nalog in doseganju skupnih ciljev. Prevzem mora biti ekonomsko upravičen, torej morata biti prevzemno in prevzeto podjetje po prevzemu vredni več kot vsako posamezno pred prevzemom. Glavna slabost združitev je samodejen prevzem vseh znanih in neznanih obveznosti prevzetega podjetja. Za uspešne združitve in prevzeme podjetij je potrebno narediti podroben poslovni načrt, oceniti vse elemente tržne, proizvodne, organizacijske in kadrovske narave, ki vplivajo na pričakovane donose in vrednost podjetja. Če bi Mercator prevzel Merkur, bi ta združitev podjetij prinesla precej priložnosti, ki bi še povečale pozitiven učinek prevzema. Mercator bi lahko dosegel svoj strateški cilj in postal največji trgovec v jugovzhodni Evropi. Hitrejša rast v podjetju bi prinesla boljše poslovne rezultate, trgovsko mrežo bi lahko posodabljali, vodenje strateške poslovne politike bi bilo lažje in dolgoročno bi se lahko maksimirala vrednost podjetja. Finančno in poslovno okrepljeni Mercator bi lahko še agresivneje nastopal na sedanjih in novih trgih s celovito zaključenim prodajnim programom. S skupnim nastopom na prodajnih trgih bi se zmanjšali stroški in povečala učinkovitost. Zmanjševalo bi se tudi poslovno tveganje. Z razširitvijo trgovske mreže, z novimi površinami in s skupnim nastopom novega podjetja na prodajnih trgih bi imeli koristi tudi potrošniki. Due to {{globalisation}} takeovers {{have got}} to be part of everyday routine. Most theories foresee positive effects for not only is the business efficiency of the company increased but also the synergy of the economy of the extent of business operation is achieved all of which is direct consequence of new combinations of formerly separated companies or direct consequence of reduction of costs. The takeover company acquires a certain share of ownership rights (stock share) of the company which is has taken over and the said share provides supervision share which makes it possible for the takeover company to discharge crucial influence upon the operation of the company which has been taken over. Any form of takeover can be performed through payments in cash, indebtedness of the company, exchange of stocks or other securities. Takeover is defined as the case where two or more companies are merged into a single one in that is has to be performed in accordance with the existing legislature. As far as merger goes there are fusions and annexations. A successfully discharged takeover is usually followed by a merger of the companies in question. As regards the discharge of obligations and achievements of mutual goals takeovers and mergers always bring about changes and different attitudes. A takeover has to be economically justified hence the takeover company and the taken-over company have to be worth more than before it. The main drawback of a merger is <b>automatic</b> <b>acceptance</b> of all known as well as unknown liabilities of the taken-over company. A successful takeover and merger of companies calls for a precise business plan thus all the elements of marketing, production, organizational and personnel management nature, which can influence the anticipated revenues and values of the company, have to be thoroughly studied and assessed. If "Mercator" should takeover "Merkur" the merger would provide a number of opportunities which would enhance the positive effects of the takeover in that "Mercator" would be able to achieve its strategic goal in getting to be the largest merchant of Southeast Europe. A faster growth of the company would bring about better business results, the trading network could be brought up to date, strategic business policy would be easier and, in the long run, the value of the company would be maximized. It would be possible for the financially invigorated "Mercator" to do business not only on its current markets but also on new ones more aggressively {{with the help of an}} integrally balanced sales program. Through mutual appearance on various markets costs could be minimized and efficiency could be increased whereby business risks would be reduced. The consumers, too, would gain a lot through expansion of sales network, new sales space and joint appearance of the new joint company on the market...|$|E
