40|$|AbstractMajor {{secondary}} pollutants {{arising from the}} incineration of domestic waste are as follows: dioxin, heavy metal element and <b>acid</b> <b>oxide.</b> They are produced by the recombined elements during oxidation when pollutants are decomposing during incineration. As you sow, so will you reap. Secondary pollutants arising from incineration exist owing to the former carrier of these pollutants in the fuel, coupled with conditions required for recombination. Facts have proven that processing domestic waste, once there is dioxin and heavy metal element, will be extremely difficulty, costing {{a huge amount of}} money and producing poor effects. This paper mainly discusses how dioxin and heavy metal element arise from the incineration of domestic waste, preventive measures and the significance of prevention...|$|E

Concurrent or successive reactions of simple carbonylation, homologation, hydrogenation to hydrocarbons, and etherification {{take place to}} varying extents. Carbonylation and etherification are favored by <b>acid</b> <b>oxides</b> and homologation and hydrogenation by basic oxides.

Heterogeneous oxides are easily separated and recycled from the reaction mixture.

The effects of ruminal buffers (salt, weak <b>acid,</b> <b>oxide</b> or hydroxide) able to neutralize acids and reduce drastic changes of rumen pH (Staples and Lough 1989) were variable, mostly due to {{the wide variety of}} conditions in which these were tested (Erdman 1988). Rumen buffers seem to improve feed efficiency of ruminants fed diets with highgrain concentration (Kennelly et al. 1999).

40|$|A new {{purification}} {{method of}} removing boron from {{metallurgical grade silicon}} (MG-Si) using a high baisicity slag was developed in this paper. The typical impurities Al, Ca, Ti, B, P etc in MG-Si can be removed by the binary calcium sillicate slag and it is especially efficient for removing impurity Boron. It {{was found that the}} maximal distribution coefficient of boron between calcium sillicate slag and silicon reaches to 1. 57 when the mass ratio of CaO/SiO 2 was 1. 5 and the composition was 60 %CaO- 40 %SiO 2. It showed that the oxidizability of calcium sillicate slag was affected and restricted by the basicity and the mass ratio of <b>acid</b> <b>oxide</b> SiO 2 slag according to the thermodynamic relationship.

The objective of this work was to find conditions for the substrate-induced coagulation (SIC) process in N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone (NMP). The SIC process is a dip-coating process that enhances adsorption of fine dispersed particles on a pre-conditioned surface. The wetting behavior of titania and NMP was investigated by the powder contact angle method. The absorption process of the polar solvent NMP on the <b>acid</b> <b>oxide</b> TiO 2 and Aerosol OT (AOT) (bis- 2 -ethylhexyl sodium sulfosuccinate) was also investigated and a polar or hydrophilic interaction was found.

40|$|Two-dimensional (2 D) {{materials}} {{have been studied}} widely owing to their outstanding properties since monolayer graphene was isolated in 2004. Especially, among 2 D materials, phosphorene, a single atomic layer of black phosphorus (BP), has been highlighted for its electrical properties. This material {{can serve as a}} substitute for graphene, which has been revealed as a “semi-metal”, in next-generation semiconductors. However, few-layer BP is prone to degradation under ambient conditions owing to its reactivity with oxygen and water, which results in the condensation of water droplets {{on the surface of the}} BP flakes. This causes charge transfer from the phosphorus atom to oxygen, resulting in the formation of phosphoric <b>acid</b> (<b>oxide)</b> and degrades the various properties of BP. Therefore, it is necessary to find passivation methods to prevent BP flakes from being degraded under ambient conditions. This review article deals with recent studies on passivation methods for BP and their performance against oxygen and water, effects on the electrical properties of BP, and the extent to how they protect BP...|$|E
40|$|Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is {{a widely}} used {{analgesic}} drug. It interacts with various enzyme families including cytochrome P 450 (CYP), cyclooxygenase (COX), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and this interplay may produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). We investigated the effects of paracetamol on prostacyclin, thromboxane, nitric oxide (NO), and oxidative stress in four male subjects who received a single 3 [*]g oral dose of paracetamol. Thromboxane and prostacyclin synthesis was assessed by measuring their major urinary metabolites 2, 3 -dinor-thromboxane B 2 and 2, 3 -dinor- 6 -ketoprostaglandin F 1 α, respectively. Endothelial NO synthesis was assessed by measuring nitrite in plasma. Urinary 15 (S) - 8 -iso-prostaglanding F 2 α was measured to assess oxidative stress. Plasma oleic <b>acid</b> <b>oxide</b> (cis-EpOA) was measured as a marker of cytochrome P 450 activity. Upon paracetamol administration, prostacyclin synthesis was strongly inhibited, while NO synthesis increased and thromboxane synthesis remained almost unchanged. Paracetamol may shift the COX-dependent vasodilatation/vasoconstriction balance {{at the cost of}} vasodilatation. This effect may be antagonized by increasing endothelial NO synthesis. High-dosed paracetamol did not increase oxidative stress. At pharmacologically relevant concentrations, paracetamol did not affect NO synthesis/bioavailability by recombinant human endothelial NOS or inducible NOS in rat hepatocytes. We conclude that paracetamol does not increase oxidative stress in humans...|$|E
40|$|Background: Oleic acid {{is a major}} systemically {{circulating}} {{fatty acid}} in humans with atheroprotective and immunomodulatory properties. As of today, the contribution of individual cytochrome P 450 (CYP) mono-oxygenases to the epoxidation of this fatty acid is unknown. Furthermore, {{the extent of the}} oleic acid oxidation product cis- 9, 10 -epoxyoctadecanoic acid (cis-EODA) in humans and its plasma levels in patients with impaired liver function are not known. Patients and methods: We studied cis-EODA in plasma of patients suffering from chronic liver diseases, a condition that often displays impaired liver CYP enzyme activities. Fifteen CYP mono-oxygenases were investigated in vitro as a potential source of cis-EODA. Results: Strikingly, plasma levels of cis-EODA were significantly repressed (P < 0. 0005) when patients with liver impairment (n= 16) were compared with healthy subjects (n= 14). Production of cis-EODA was catalysed by CYP in the following order: 2 C 8, 2 C 9, 2 C 19, 3 A 4, 1 A 2 and CYP 3 A 7. Conclusion: cis-EODA plasma concentrations are decreased in hepatic disease with impaired liver function. Oleic acid is primarily oxidized to oleic <b>acid</b> <b>oxide</b> (cis-EODA) by CYP 2 C and CYP 3 A mono-oxygenases. The liver is the major organ responsible for the oxidation of oleic acid to cis-EODA, and thus, cis-EODA may be a suitable biomarker to assess liver function...|$|E

40|$|SiO 2 is {{the most}} widely used {{dielectric}} material but its growth or deposition involves high thermal budgets or suffers from shadowing effects. The low-temperature method presented here (150 degrees C) for the preparation of SiO 2 by thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) provides perfect uniformity and surface coverage even into nanoscale pores, which may well suit recent demands in nanoelectronics and nanotechnology. The ALD reaction based on 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane, water, and ozone provides outstanding SiO 2 quality and is free of catalysts or corrosive by-products. A variety of optical, structural, and electrical properties are investigated by means of infrared spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, secondary ion mass spectrometry, capacitance-voltage and current-voltage measurements, electron spin resonance, Rutherford backscattering, elastic recoil detection analysis, atomic force microscopy, and variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry. Many features, such as the optical constants (n, k) and optical transmission and surface roughness (1. 5 A degrees), are found to be similar to thermal oxide quality. Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 1000 degrees C is demonstrated to significantly improve certain properties, in particular by reducing the etch rate in hydrofluoric <b>acid,</b> <b>oxide</b> charges, and interface defects. Besides a small amount of OH groups and a few atomic per mille of nitrogen in the oxide remaining from the growth and curable by RTA no impurities could be traced. Altogether, the data point to a first reliable low temperature ALD-growth process for silicon dioxide. status: publishe...|$|E
