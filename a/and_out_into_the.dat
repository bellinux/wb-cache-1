Her first attack {{took place}} on 28 May, {{south-west}} of Land's End, when she fired a torpedo at the British merchant ship Alca. She missed, and then opened fire with her deck gun. The armed ship returned fire, but neither vessel made any hits; the U-boat broke off the attack.|$|E
5|$|At around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda {{left the}} bunker {{and walked up}} to the garden of the Chancellery, where they {{committed}} suicide. There are several different accounts of this event. According to one account, Goebbels shot Magda and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards. Goebbels' SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies.

25|$|While Forrestal was {{undergoing}} its refit, Captain Beling was temporarily assigned {{to work in}} the office of Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, then the Chief of Naval Operations. Although the subsequent Naval investigation absolved Beling of responsibility for the fire, he was transferred to staff work, and did not return to active command. From 8 April to 15 April 1968, Captain Robert B. Baldwin sailed the ship down the Elizabeth River <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> waters off the Virginia Capes for her post-repair trials, the ship's first time at sea in 207 days. While accomplishing trials, the ship also recorded its first arrested landing since the fire, when Commander Robert E. Ferguson, Commander, CVW-17, landed on board.|$|E

25|$|Solomon {{began to}} build the Temple in the 480th year after the Israelites came out of Egypt, in the fourth year of his reign, in the month Ziv. The Temple {{measured}} 60 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high, and had a portico 20 cubits long and 10 cubits deep. Its windows were broad within and narrow without. Along the Temple's wall all around were side-structures and side-chambers, with the lowest story of the side-structure 5 cubits broad, the middle 6 cubits broad, and the third story 7 cubits broad, and recesses ringed the outside wall. The Temple was built from stone made ready at the quarry, and no hammer, ax, or other iron tool was heard at the building site. The door for the lowest story of side-chambers {{was on the right}} side of the Temple, and winding stairs went into the middle story <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> third. So Solomon built the Temple and finished it with planks of cedar over beams, with all the Temple resting on cedar timbers.|$|E
25|$|South Carolina, under Captain John Joyner, {{was built}} at Amsterdam in 1780. She {{originally}} was named Indien and belonged to France but the Americans hired her. The ship {{was the most}} heavily armed warship to sail under American colors during the revolution. Joyner was attempting to dash out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, through the British blockade on 19 December with several vessels. As well as the large South Carolina, the privateer brig Hope, commanded by John Prole of ten guns and carrying tobacco and flour, another privateer brig Constance, under Commander Jesse Harding, and the six-gun schooner Seagrove, under Captain Benjamin Bradhurst, which had joined them for protection. On 19 December Seagrove hailed a merchant vessel entering the river. Her master learned that three large sail had been seen patrolling off the Cape May Channel. With this information Joyner decided to proceed down the main channel and go straight out into the ocean. On 20 December, in the early evening, the four vessels sailed down the channel <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic.|$|E

500|$|With a $15 million budget, {{production}} {{began on}} February 23, 2009 in Atlanta, Georgia. Zombie acknowledged that filming in Georgia provided certain {{tax breaks for}} the company, but the real reason he chose that location was because the other locations {{he was planning to}} use were still experiencing snowy weather. For him, Georgia's landscapes and locations provided the look that he wanted for his film. During production, Zombie described the sequel as being [...] "Ultra gritty, ultra intense and very real" [...] and said {{that he was trying to}} create almost the exact opposite of what people would expect. Known for filming multiple sequences during production of his films, Zombie filmed an alternate ending to Halloween II. In the alternate ending, Loomis and Michael crash through the shed the police have surrounded, <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open air.

[...] Angered by the questions, Spears replies (albeit censored): [...] "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, fuck you – I'm out", referencing a scene from the film Half Baked. After leaving the press conference, Spears walks out of the building <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> street, wearing a white leather jacket and a black skirt with matching with studded combat boots. She signs a fan's copy of Femme Fatale and then blows a kiss to a baby as he whistles the melody of the chorus. As Spears walks along the street, she flashes several men, including a policeman (played by Adrien Galo). As a criminal offence, the policeman searches Spears, feeling up and down her legs, as she is bent over a car. Spears later walks away from the policeman, swinging handcuffs around her finger while he buttons his shirt.|$|E

500|$|U-27 had a {{very short}} career, {{conducting}} only one war patrol and sinking only two enemy vessels before she herself was sunk. She left Wilhelmshaven on her first war patrol on 23 August 1939. For a period of 24 days, she traveled down the coast of Germany and neutral Belgium and the Netherlands, through the English Channel <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean {{off the coast of}} Ireland. Here, the boat sank two British trawlers, totaling 624 tons. The first attack took place at 2:55 on 13 September, [...] northwest of Tory Island, when the trawler Davara was shelled by U-27s deck gun. Following the sinking of Davara, her captain and 11 other crew members were picked up by the steam merchant ship Willowpool. The second vessel to be sunk was the trawler Rudyard Kipling. The attack took place at 3:53 on 16 September, [...] west of the west coast of neutral Ireland, with the ship being sunk by scuttling charges from U-27. Following the sinking of Rudyard Kipling, the submarine picked up the crew of the trawler who were then given food and warm clothes.

500|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the disturbance, which spread to Newgate Prison next door and continued into the night, Sheppard escaped for the fourth time. [...] He unlocked his handcuffs and removed the chains. [...] Still encumbered by his leg irons, he attempted to climb up the chimney, but his path was blocked by an iron bar set into the brickwork. [...] He removed the bar {{and used it to}} break through the ceiling into the [...] "Red Room" [...] above the [...] "Castle", a room which had last been used some seven years before to confine aristocratic Jacobite prisoners after the Battle of Preston. [...] Still wearing his leg irons as night fell, he then broke through six barred doors into the prison chapel, then to the roof of Newgate, 60feet (20m) above the ground. [...] He went back down to his cell to get a blanket, then back to the roof of the prison, and used the blanket to reach the roof of an adjacent house, owned by William Bird, a turner. [...] He broke into Bird's house, and went down the stairs <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> street at around midnight without disturbing the occupants. [...] Escaping through the streets to the north and west, Sheppard hid in a cowshed in Tottenham (near modern Tottenham Court Road). [...] Spotted by the barn's owner, Sheppard told him that he had escaped from Bridewell Prison, having been imprisoned there for failing to support a (nonexistent) bastard son. [...] His leg irons remained in place for several days until he persuaded a passing shoemaker to accept the considerable sum of 20 shillings to bring a blacksmith's tools and help him remove them, telling him the same tale. [...] His manacles and leg irons were later recovered in the rooms of Kate Cook, one of Sheppard's mistresses. [...] This escape astonished everyone. Daniel Defoe, working as a journalist, wrote an account for John Applebee, The History of the Remarkable Life of John Sheppard. [...] In his History, Defoe reports the belief in Newgate that the Devil came in person to assist Sheppard's escape.|$|E
