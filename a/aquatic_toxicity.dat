Dormant Pesticide Applications One of the issues of concern regarding pesticide runoff monitoring is the application of dormant-spray pesticides to orchards just prior to major stormwater runoff events. In order to adequately monitor for potential discharges from dormant-spray applications, there is need to develop a technically valid approach for determining worst-case water quality objective violations due to the use of these pesticides. Agricultural interests will likely be able to control stormwater runoff of these pesticides during low to moderate runoff events. However, as Lee (2005 a) indicated in his comments on the draft DPR-proposed regulations governing dormant application of the OP pesticides, there will be runoff events associated with large storms when violations of the pesticide TMDL goal will likely occur following application. It is under such conditions that there is the greatest potential for high concentrations of OP and other pesticides to be present i...|$|R

40|$|Although many {{chemicals}} are in use, {{the environmental impacts}} of only a few have been established, usually on per-chemical basis. Uncertainty remains about the overall impact of chemicals. This paper estimates combined toxic pressure on coastal North Sea ecosystems from 343 high-production-volume chemicals used within the catchment of rivers Rhine, Meuse, and Scheldt. Multimedia fate modeling and species sensitivity distribution-based effects estimation are applied. Calculations start from production volumes and emission rates and use physicochemical substance properties and aquatic ecotoxicity data. Parameter uncertainty is addressed by Monte Carlo simulations. Results suggest that the procedure is technically feasible. Combined toxic pressure of all 343 chemicals in coastal North Seawater is 0. 025 (2. 5 % of the species are exposed to concentration levels above EC 50 values), with a wide confidence interval of nearly 0 - 1. This uncertainty appears to be largely due to uncertainties in interspecies variances of <b>aquatic</b> <b>toxicities</b> and, to a lesser extent, to uncertainties in emissions and degradation rates. Due to these uncertainties, the results support gross ranking of chemicals in categories: negligible and possibly relevant contributions only. With 95 % confidence, 283 of the 343 chemicals (83 %) contribute negligibly (less than 0. 1 %) to overall toxic pressure, and only 60 (17 %) need further consideration...|$|R
