5|$|E. eastwoodiae, E. nelsonii, E. rupestris, <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> verbenacea {{are also}} pollinated by hummingbirds. These four species {{as well as}} E. cardinalis <b>and</b> <b>E.</b> nelsonii produce {{bisexual}} flowers and are self-compatible. This approximate ratio of insect vs hummingbird pollination holds true {{for the rest of}} the genus. There have been two separate transformations to hummingbird pollination. Pollination changes are highly affected by changes in flower morphology. E. cardinalis and its sister species E. cinnabarina likely evolved via allopatric speciation.|$|E

5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover the planet is that only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. Further astrometric observations with the Hubble Space Telescope on the outer planet 55 Cancri d suggest that planet is inclined at 53° to {{the plane of the}} sky; but innermost b <b>and</b> <b>e</b> are inclined at 85°.

5|$|Antioxidant {{vitamins}} {{are found}} in vegetables, fruits, eggs, legumes and nuts. Vitamins A, C, <b>and</b> <b>E</b> can be destroyed by long-term storage or prolonged cooking. The effects of cooking and food processing are complex, as these processes can also increase the bioavailability of antioxidants, such as some carotenoids in vegetables. Processed food contains fewer antioxidant vitamins than fresh and uncooked foods, as preparation exposes food to heat and oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Around 1450 the Chajoma, led {{by their}} king Lajuj No'j, moved to Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo) from Ochal {{to make their}} capital more {{inaccessible}} to their hostile neighbours. In spite of this, Iximche defeated the Chajoma and Jilotepeque Viejo became subject to the Kaqchikel kingdom. Groups C <b>and</b> <b>E</b> show Kaqchikel influence in their architectural styles, while groups A and B have a purer Chajoma architectural style.
