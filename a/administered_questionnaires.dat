40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: The primary {{aim of the}} {{research}} described in this paper was to ascertain whether inclusion of a self <b>administered</b> <b>questionnaire</b> with the usual invitation to routine breast screening affected screening uptake. Secondary aims included establishing appropriate questionnaire distribution and collection methods {{within the framework of the}} National Health Service Breast Screening Programme and optimisation of questionnaire design. DESIGN: Randomised study. SETTING: Oxfordshire and West of London Breast Screening Units. PARTICIPANTS/METHODS: 6400 women invited for routine screening mammography were individually randomised to receive either the usual breast screening invitation alone, or to receive the usual invitation accompanied by a self <b>administered</b> <b>questionnaire,</b> to be returned at the time of screening. Participants were then followed up and attendance rates at screening were compared between groups. MAIN RESULTS: Screening attendance rates were similar in women who did and did not receive a questionnaire (71 % in each group). Of those who were sent a questionnaire and attended for screening, 77 % returned a completed questionnaire. Screening uptake was not affected by the way in which the questionnaire was returned or by whether or not personal details and signed permission for follow up were requested. CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of a self <b>administered</b> <b>questionnaire</b> accompanying the invitation to breast screening did not adversely affect screening uptake. A high proportion of women completed the questionnaire...|$|R

40|$|A data {{collection}} instrument that a respondent self-completes through the visual channel, such as on paper {{or over the}} Web, is visually administered. Although insightful in many ways, traditional methods of evaluating questionnaires, such as cognitive interviewing, usability testing, and experimentation may be insufficient {{when it comes to}} evaluating the design of visually <b>administered</b> <b>questionnaires</b> because these methods cannot directly identify information respondents perceive or the precise order in which they observe the information (Redline et al 1998). In this paper, we present the results of a study that was conducted to explore whether eye-movement analysis might prove a promising new tool for evaluating the design of visually <b>administered</b> <b>questionnaires.</b> Eye tracking hardware and software, which were originally developed in the Systems Engineering Department of the University of Virginia for use with computer monitors, were adapted to track the eye movements of respondents answering three versions of a paper questionnaire. These versions were chosen for study because differences in the design of their branching instructions were hypothesized to affect eye-movements, which in turn may affect the accuracy of following the branching instruction...|$|E
