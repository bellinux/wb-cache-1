6000|$|... "Something dreadful! One often anticipates {{something}} very bad without exactly knowing what. <b>At</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I am always expecting a catastrophe;--when I am alone that is;--and then I am so often alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are mistaken, Miss Hardinge. Grace must {{excuse me}} for being a little selfish this time, <b>at</b> <b>least.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not intend those pearls for Miss Wallingford, but for Mrs. Wallingford, should there ever be such a person." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall have}} to get further away from you," [...] he said more quietly. [...] "There's no knowing what may happen if I don't. I don't want to kill you. <b>At</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> but I had better not." ...|$|E
60|$|JUNO. Yes <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> But I'm an Englishman; and I {{think you}} ought to respect the {{conventions}} of English life.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold your breaths!" [...] cried Yva, and we obeyed {{until we}} nearly burst. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> but what {{happened}} to the others <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and we even quarrelled over it. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Ludovic wouldn't {{quarrel with}} anyone. You {{have to fight}} air when you spar with him. I hate to square up {{to a person who}} won't hit back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "His cunning, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> which, in Court affairs, {{often takes}} the weather-gage of wisdom,--as in Yarmouth Roads a herring-buss will baffle a frigate. He shall {{not return to}} London if I can help it, until all these intrigues are over." ...|$|E
6000|$|She laughed softly. [...] "Women have {{no future}} {{and they ask}} none. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not now, though once I did. It is enough for them if they can ever so little help the lives of others. That is their happiness, and their reward is--rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{she does}} not say. But she {{describes}} {{the attitude of the}} educated people--who should know better--as callous in the extreme. Of course, my sister-in-law is one of those active modern women, who always takes things up, you know--the kind of woman one admires, though one does not feel, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not feel--but then she has a constitution of iron." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks!" [...] said Austin. [...] "I suppose in {{one respect}} that's a compliment. Still, I almost think, or, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> when <b>I</b> first went down there, that if I'd known what {{was in front of}} me I'd have stayed in Grand Canary." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{she only}} smiled and, {{shaking her head}} in a {{fascinating}} way that was peculiar to her, remarked that I could not deceive her as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the Kaffirs. After this the solid Kaatje brought the food and we breakfasted very heartily, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
60|$|Wrote to H.:--he {{has been}} telling that I------[3] <b>I</b> am sure, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not mention it, and I wish he had not. He is a good fellow, and I obliged myself ten times more by being of use than <b>I</b> <b>did</b> him,--and there's an end on't.|$|R
6000|$|... "We whose {{ambition}} {{it is to}} {{be looked}} upon in the light of respectable practitioners, sir, can but put our shoulders to the wheel. We do it, sir. <b>At</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it myself; and I wish to think well of my professional brethren, one and all. You are sensible of an obligation not to refer to me, miss, in communicating with Mr. C.?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thought this}} {{account of the}} struldbrugs might be some {{entertainment}} to the reader, {{because it seems to}} be a little out of the common way; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not remember to have met the like in any book of travels that has come to my hands: and if I am deceived, my excuse must be, that it is necessary for travellers who describe the same country, very often to agree in dwelling on the same particulars, without deserving the censure of having borrowed or transcribed from those who wrote before them.|$|E
60|$|After that, what happened? Heaven knows alone--or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not. But {{in later}} years Mr. Osborn, {{afterwards}} the resident magistrate at Newcastle, in Natal, who, being young and foolish in those days, had swum his horse over the Tugela and hidden in a little kopje quite near to us {{in order to see}} the battle, told me that it looked as though some huge breaker--that breaker being the splendid Amawombe--rolling in towards the shore with the weight of the ocean behind it, had suddenly struck a ridge of rock and, rearing itself up, submerged and hidden it.|$|E
6000|$|At which answer, {{it seems}} to me, another sneer might curl {{the lip of the}} august shade, as he said to himself--"This, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not expect, when I made Christianity the state {{religion}} of my empire. But you, good barbarian, look clean enough. You do not look on dirt as a sign of sanctity?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} we did no work. In fact, we slept till three in the afternoon, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> for <b>I</b> awoke to find Maud cooking dinner. Her power of {{recuperation}} was wonderful. There was something tenacious about that lily-frail body of hers, a clutch on existence which one could not reconcile with its patent weakness.|$|R
60|$|<b>At</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not want}} in confidence; and when I next rushed Solan {{it was to}} one side with {{implicit}} confidence that he must turn to meet my new line of attack, and turn he did, so that now we fought with our sides towards the coveted goal--the great switch stood within my reach upon my right hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mayhap, Macumazahn, but my wrongs are {{the wrongs}} of a nation, {{therefore}} I {{think of the}} nation, and <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not fear death like you white men. Now hearken. Presently your friends will tell you a story. The lady Heddana {{will tell you how}} I made use of her for a certain purpose, for which purpose indeed I drew the three of you into Zululand, because without her I could not have brought about this war into which Cetewayo did not wish to enter. When you have heard that story, do not judge me too hardly, Macumazahn, who had a great end to gain." ...|$|E
6000|$|Allan hesitated. [...] "I {{hardly know}} how to put it," [...] he replied. [...] "As you said just now, I love her, and she loves me; and yet there is a sort of strangeness between us. One talks a good deal about one's self when one is in love, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I've told her all about myself and my mother, and how I came in for this place, and the rest of it. Well--though it doesn't strike me when we are together--it comes across me now and then, when I'm away from her, that she doesn't say much on her side. In fact, I know no more about her than you do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me, Floating-light, and you, ye sun, [...] Moon, stars, and {{elements}} of Nature, every one; [...] I did but vent my misery and spleen [...] In utt'ring words of fury that I hardly mean. [...] <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> in part--but hold! why not? [...] Oh! cease ye fiendish thoughts that rage and plot [...] To bring about my ruin. Hence! avaunt! [...] Or else in pity {{tell me what}} you want. [...] I cannot live, and yet I would not die! [...] My hopes are blighted! Where, oh whither shall I fly? [...] 'Tis past! I'll cease to daily with vain sophistry, [...] And try the virtue of a calm philosophy." ...|$|E
60|$|When we {{had done}} all we could, we sat down, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and waited. The night, I remember, was strangely still, only from the slopes {{on either side of}} our plateau came a kind of {{rustling}} sound which in fact was caused by the feet of Rezu's people, as they marched to surround us.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, mother, that's it; but it's {{all over}} and no harm <b>done,</b> and <b>I</b> think we'd better let it be, for a while <b>at</b> <b>least.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> feel guilty to keep {{anything}} from you, but now {{you know so much}} I shall not worry and you needn't either. Ted's sorry, I don't mind, and it has done us both good.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Mackenzie {{is making}} a long visit at the Cedars," [...] said Miss Colza, [...] "that is all we know at present. I am told the Balls are very nice people, but perhaps a little worldly-minded; that's to be expected, however, from people who live out of the west-end from London. I live in Finsbury Square, or <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> before <b>I</b> came here, and I ain't a bit ashamed to own it. But of course the west-end is the nicest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Two hundred gold shekels," [...] replied Metem reflectively, [...] "nay, I am {{sure you}} said two hundred, Issachar. <b>At</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not work for less, {{and it is a}} small sum enough, seeing that to earn it I must take upon myself the guilt of {{severing}} two loving hearts. But I know well that you are right, and that this would be an evil marriage for the prince Aziel, and also for the lady Elissa, who then day by day and year by year must bear the scourge of your reproaches, Issachar. Therefore I will do my best, not for the money indeed, but because I see herein a righteous duty. And now here is parchment, give me the lamp that I may prepare the bond." ...|$|E
60|$|It was not, I think, {{from his}} American blood that Leigh Hunt derived either his amiability or his {{peaceful}} inclinations; <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not see how}} we can reasonably claim the former quality as a national characteristic, though the latter might have been fairly inherited from his ancestors on the mother's side, who were Pennsylvania Quakers. But the kind of excellence that distinguished him--his fineness, subtilty, and grace--was that which the richest cultivation has heretofore tended to develop in the happier examples of American genius, and which (though I say it a little reluctantly) is perhaps what our future intellectual advancement may make general among us. His person, at all events, was thoroughly American, and of the best type, as were likewise his manners; for we are the best as well as the worst mannered people in the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir--I {{know of no}} misery but a jail {{to which}} my own imprudences and your letter seem to point. I have seen it {{inevitable}} these three or four weeks, and, by heavens! request it as a favor--as a favor that may prevent something more fatal. I have been some years struggling with a wretched being--with all that contempt that indigence brings with it--with all those passions which make contempt insupportable. What, then, has a jail that is formidable. I shall at least have the society of wretches, and such is to me true society. I tell you, again and again, that I am neither able nor willing to pay you a farthing, but I will be punctual to any appointment you or the tailor shall make: thus far, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not act the sharper, since, unable to pay my own debts one way, I would generally give some security another. No, sir; had I been a sharper--had I been possessed of less good-nature and native generosity, I might surely now have been in better circumstances.|$|E
60|$|Her prize {{consisted}} in a male {{about four}} feet tall, very strong and physically perfect; also, he learned quickly, and we had considerable amusement, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> over the keen rivalry we displayed. The Martian language, as I have said, is extremely simple, and in a week I could make all my wants known and understand nearly everything that was said to me. Likewise, under Sola's tutelage, I developed my telepathic powers so that I shortly could sense practically everything that went on around me.|$|R
60|$|However, I {{wore out}} {{a year and}} three months more before I ever saw any more of the savages, and then I found them again, as I shall soon observe. It is true, {{they might have been}} there once or twice, but either they made no stay, or, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not hear them; but in the month of May, as near as I could calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year, I had a very strange {{encounter}} with them, of which in its place.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mayhap, Sir. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> none {{of these}} things, and poesy wearies me to read, much more to write. But I can ask a {{question}} and take an answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, well!' thought Siegmund--he was tired--'if one bee dies in a swarm, what is it, {{so long as}} {{the hive}} is all right? Apart from the gold light, and the hum and the colour of day, what was I? Nothing! Apart from these rushings out of the hive, along with swarm, into the dark meadows of night, {{gathering}} God knows what, I was a pebble. Well, the day will swarm in golden again, with colour on the wings of every bee, and humming in each activity. The gold and the colour and sweet smell and the sound of life, they exist, even if there is no bee; it only happens we see the iridescence on the wings of a bee. It exists whether or not, bee or no bee. Since the iridescence and the humming of life are always, and since it was they who made me, then I am not lost. <b>At</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not care. If the spark goes out, the essence of the fire is there in the darkness. What does it matter? Besides, I have burned bright; I have laid up a fine cell of honey somewhere--I wonder where? We can never point to it; but it is so--what does it matter, then!' ...|$|E
60|$|My {{life here}} is not eventful, {{but on the other}} hand it is not dull. I am never unoccupied, and time passes away in an easy, steady flow, which is very tranquillizing and {{soothing}} to me. The first thing after breakfast I read the Times aloud to Mrs. Mapleside, and then whenever there is an accident I look out the train in Bradshaw, and she is always devoutly thankful for another hairbreadth escape which she insists we have had. About eleven, either one or other of my friends comes in with her work and sits with us until lunch-time, or else I myself go out to call upon one of them. After lunch we go for a walk, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> and Mrs. Mapleside makes calls--to which she is very partial, and of which I confess I have quite a horror. Indeed, I never pay regular visits, preferring much to take my work and sit for a while of a morning at the houses where I am intimate. After dinner, Mrs. Mapleside dozes, and I go up into my room--for it has been summer--and write my story. I have now been here six months, and in that time have, between dinner and tea, written this little history of the principal events in my life, and in the lives of those dear to me; and the exercise has been a great solace and amusement to me. I have nearly come to an end now.|$|E
6000|$|IN THE evening Henrietta amused {{her guests}} with music. Mrs. Montgomery Floyd was enthusiastically fond of music, and {{very proud of}} her {{intimate}} friendship with Pasta. 'Oh! you know her, do you?' 'Very well; you shall bring her to my house. She shall sing at all my parties; I love music at my evenings, but I never pay for it, never. If she will not come in the evening, I will try {{to ask her to}} dinner, once <b>at</b> <b>least.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not like singers and tumblers at dinner, but she is very fashionable, and young men like her; and what I want at my dinners are young men, young men of very great fashion. I rather want young men at my dinners. I have some; Lord Languid always comes to me, and he is very fine, you know, very fine indeed. He goes to very few places, but he always comes to me.' Mrs. Montgomery Floyd quitted the piano, and seated herself by Mr. Temple. Mr. Temple was gallant, and Mrs. Montgomery Floyd anxious to obtain the notice of a gentleman whom Lady Bellair had assured her was of the first ton. Her ladyship herself beckoned Henrietta Temple to join her on the sofa, and, taking her hand very affectionately, explained to her all the tactics by which she intended to bring-about a match between her and Lord Fitzwarrene, very much regretting, at the same time, that her dear grandson, Lord Bellair, was married; for he, after all, was the only person worthy of her. 'He would taste you, my dear; he would understand you. Dear Bellair! he is so very handsome, and so very witty. Why did he go and marry? And yet I love his wife. Do you know her? Oh! she is charming: so very pretty, so very witty, and such good blood in her veins. I made the match. Why were you not in England? If you had only come to England a year sooner, you should have married Bellair. How provoking!' ...|$|E
6000|$|ADAM [ruminating] You puzzle me. My old {{trouble was}} heavy; {{but it was}} simple. These wonders that you promise to do may tangle up my being before they bring me the gift of death. I was troubled with the burden of eternal being; but I was not {{confused}} in my mind. If <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know that <b>I</b> loved Eve, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know that she might cease to love me, and come to love some other Adam and desire my death. Can you find a name for that knowledge? ...|$|R
60|$|Presently I saw Emett {{coming through}} the woods leading and {{dragging}} the Indian. I felt sorry for the Navvy, for I felt that his fear {{was not so much}} physical as spiritual. And it seemed no wonder to me that the Navvy should hang back from this sacrilegious treatment of his god. A natural wisdom, which I had in common with all human beings who consider self preservation the first law of life, deterred me from acquainting my august companions with my belief. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not want to break up the camp.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I?" [...] said Henry, [...] "I am sure <b>I</b> didn't; <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> if <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>I</b> {{only said}} Bess peeped everywhere, {{and was very}} close. I didn't suspect her, you know." ...|$|R
