A definitive version was subsequently published in REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS, [VOL 22, ISSUE 44, (2014) ] DOI: 10. 1016 /S 0968 - 8080 (14) 44818 - 3 This article draws on legal arguments made by civil society organisations to challenge the legal reasoning that apparently produced the decision in the Ms Y case in Ireland in August 2014. I show how legal standards of reasonableness and practicality ought to be interpreted in ways that are respectful of the patient's wishes and rights. The case concerned a decision by the Health Service Executive, the Irish public health authority, to refuse an abortion to a pregnant asylum seeker and rape survivor on the grounds that a caesarean section and early live delivery were practicable and reasonable alternatives justified by the need to protect fetal life. I argue that the <b>abortion</b> <b>refusal</b> may not have been a reasonable decision, as required by the terms of relevant legislation, for four different reasons. First, the alternative of a caesarean section and early live delivery was not likely to avert the risk of suicide, and in fact did not do so. Second, the consent to the caesarean section alternative may not have been a real consent in the legal sense if it was not voluntary. Third, an <b>abortion</b> <b>refusal</b> and forcible treatment fall below the norms of good medical practice as interpreted through a patient-centred perspective. Fourth, an <b>abortion</b> <b>refusal</b> that entails forms of cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment ought not to be a reasonable action under the legislation...|$|E
40|$|The chapter {{begins with}} a general outline of the central tenets of Jewish law, Catholic law and Islamic law, for an {{examination}} of how these religions value the sanctity of life. In later parts, the chapter looks at specific situations to examine how the sanctity of life principle works {{in comparison with the}} common law; in laws of abortion; and how and when medical treatment can be refused. It is contended that in areas of both <b>abortion</b> and treatment <b>refusal,</b> the common law has drawn heavily on religious ideas found in Judaism, Catholicism, and Islam. 26 page(s...|$|R
500|$|According to Article 109 of the constitution: [...] "The King {{sanctions}} and promulgates laws". In Belgium, the royal assent is called sanction royale / koninklijke bekrachtiging (Royal Sanction), and is {{granted by the}} King signing the proposed statute. The Belgian constitution requires a theoretically possible refusal of royal sanction to be countersigned—as any other act of the monarch—by a minister responsible before the House of Representatives. The monarch promulgates the law, meaning {{that he or she}} formally orders that the law be officially published and executed. In 1990, when King Baudouin advised his cabinet he could not, in conscience, sign a bill decriminalising <b>abortion</b> (a <b>refusal</b> patently not covered by a responsible minister), the Council of Ministers, at the King's own request, declared Baudouin incapable of exercising his powers. In accordance with the Belgian constitution, upon the declaration of the sovereign's incapacity, the Council of Ministers assumed the powers of the head of state until parliament could rule on the King's incapacity and appoint a regent. The bill was then assented to by all members of the Council of Ministers [...] "on behalf of the Belgian People". In a joint meeting, both houses of parliament declared the King capable of exercising his powers again the next day.|$|R
5000|$|The law {{failed to}} create any {{substantive}} rights. The law enacted by Congress only obliged {{the federal courts}} to review the rulings of the Florida state courts to determine if procedural due process had been afforded. However, there was no serious argument that the Florida courts had violated any constitutionally mandated procedural requirements. Congress could have specified in the statute that the bill sought to enforce a substantive due process right to life, enacted pursuant to section five of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. However, the social conservatives who championed the legislation {{have been reluctant to}} rely on the rights created under this provision, as it has also been interpreted by the Supreme Court as providing the underpinning for the right to <b>abortion</b> and for <b>refusal</b> to receive life-saving medical assistance.|$|R
40|$|Conscientious {{objection}} to <b>abortion,</b> clinicians' <b>refusal</b> to perform legal abortions {{because of their}} religious or moral beliefs, {{has been the subject}} of increasing debate among bioethicists, policymakers, and public health advocates in recent years. Conscientious objection policies are intended to balance reproductive rights and clinicians' beliefs. However, in practice, clinician objection can act as a barrier to abortion access-impinging on reproductive rights, and increasing unsafe abortion and related morbidity and mortality. There is little information about conscientious objection from a medical or public health perspective. A quantitative instrument is needed to assess prevalence of conscientious objection and to provide insight on its practice. This paper describes the development of a survey instrument to measure conscientious {{objection to}} abortion provision. A literature review, and in-depth formative interviews with stakeholders in Colombia were used to develop a conceptual model of conscientious objection. This model led to the development of a survey, which was piloted, and then administered, in Ghana. The model posits three domains of conscientious objection that form the basis for the survey instrument: 1) beliefs about abortion and conscientious objection; 2) actions related to conscientious objection and abortion; and 3) self-identification as a conscientious objector. The instrument is intended to be used to assess prevalence among clinicians trained to provide abortions, and to gain insight on how conscientious objection is practiced in a variety of settings. Its results can inform more effective and appropriate strategies to regulate conscientious objection...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} smoking, alcohol, and caffeine consumption and socio-economic factors and psychosocial stress on birth weight. DESIGN [...] Prospective population study. SETTING [...] District general hospital in inner London. PARTICIPANTS [...] A consecutive series of 1860 white women booking for delivery were approached. 136 Refused and 211 failed to complete the study for other reasons (moved, <b>abortion,</b> subsequent <b>refusal),</b> leaving a sample of 1513. Women who spoke no English, booked after 24 weeks, had insulin dependent diabetes, or had a multiple pregnancy were excluded. MEASUREMENTS [...] Data were obtained by research interviewers at booking (general health questionnaire, modified Paykel's interview, and Eysenck personality questionnaire) and at 17, 28, and 36 weeks' gestation and from the structured antenatal and obstetric record. Variables assessed included smoking, alcohol consumption, caffeine consumption, and over 40 indicators of socio-economic state and psychosocial stress, including social class, tenure of accommodations, education, employment, income, anxiety and depression, stressful life events, social stress, social support, personality, and attitudes to pregnancy. Birth weight was corrected for gestation and adjusted for maternal height, parity, and baby's sex. MAIN RESULTS [...] Smoking {{was the most important}} single factor (5 % reduction in corrected birth weight). Passive smoking was not significant (0. 5 % reduction). After smoking was controlled for, alcohol had an effect only in smokers and the effects of caffeine became non-significant. Only four of the socioeconomic and stress factors significantly reduced birth weight and these effects became non-significant after smoking was controlled for. CONCLUSIONS [...] Social and psychological factors have little or no direct effect on birth weight corrected for gestational age (fetal growth), and the main environmental cause of its variation in this population was smoking...|$|R

It is difficult to make him change his opinions, and quite impossible to argue with him. How can you argue {{with a man who}} is firmly convinced that medicine is the best science, that doctors are the best people and that medical traditions are the best traditions. '- Anton Chekhov, A Boring Story Christian medical students enter medical school with the belief that "God put us there. " What we fail to realize is that we are "put " into an educational system that is anti-Christian. Apart from soliciting obviously anti-biblical stances such as <b>abortion</b> on demand, <b>refusal</b> of non-insured (read:poor) patients, and cutthroat competition for grades, the walls of medical school whisper daily in our ears, "You must separate your beliefs (especially if they are Christian) from the practice of medicine. " This is the greatest lie told in medical school. We not only quietly listen to this lie- we tell it. Like many of God's people throughout history, we embrace pagan cultural values, rituals and behaviors with the misunderstanding that they are consistent with God's will- for too many of us, medical school is our golden calf, our brass serpent, and our temple of money changers. If we plan on being authentic Christians working respectfully in the fields of medicine, we must begin to train ourselves to recognize and reject the pagan American myths currently told to us in our medical institutions. I will outline nine myths I have encountered throughout medical school, and suggest some options that enable us to be more authentic Christians and better physicians. MYTH # 1...|$|R
