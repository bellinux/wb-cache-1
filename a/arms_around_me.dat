500|$|Muddy Waters {{recorded}} After the Rain {{the following}} year, incorporating {{elements of the}} sound of Electric Mud. According to Cosey, [...] "I'll never forget, as soon as I walked into the studio for the follow-up and Muddy saw me, he threw his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> said 'Hey, how you doing, boy, play some of that stuff you played on that last album.'" [...] Following strong criticism of the album, Muddy Waters claimed that he disliked the album and its sound, {{and that he did}} not consider the album to be blues. He stated, [...] "Every time I go into Chess, [...] put some un-blues players with me [...] If you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man." [...] In the biography The Mojo Man, Muddy Waters stated [...] "That Electric Mud record was dogshit. But when it came out, it started selling like wild, but then they started sending them back. They said, 'This can't be Muddy Waters with all this shit going on, all this wha-wha and fuzztone.'" [...] AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger panned the album as being [...] "crass".|$|E
500|$|... "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] {{is a power}} ballad {{that was}} written by Clarkson, Max Martin, and Dr. Luke and {{produced}} by the latter two. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, it is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 90 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F sharp minor with Clarkson's vocal range spanning over two octaves from F#3 to F#5. The bridge was {{the only part of}} the song that was written by Dr. Luke and Martin together with Clarkson face to face. The song begins with Clarkson wailing [...] "oh oh oh" [...] over a restless percussion. In the first verse, the music becomes quiet to focus on Clarkson's vocal as she wails [...] "Seems like just yesterday/You were a part of me/I used to stand so tall/I used to be so strong/Your <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> tight/Everything it felt so right/Unbreakable like nothing could go wrong." [...] During the chorus, the sound of electronic guitar is dominant as she vocalizes [...] "Here I am/Once again/I’m torn into pieces/Can’t deny it/Can’t pretend/Just thought you were the one/Broken up deep inside/But you won’t get to see the tears I cry/Behind these hazel eyes." [...] Gil Kaufman of MTV noticed that the song [...] "soared on crunchy guitars, driving beats and anthemic, agitated choruses." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1983, Fältskog {{released}} her first post-ABBA solo album, Wrap Your <b>Arms</b> <b>Around</b> <b>Me.</b> The album became a moderate hit in North America and Australia, but reached the higher {{regions of the}} charts across Europe, including No. 1 in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Belgium, and Denmark (where it became the biggest-selling album of the year), and No. 18 in the UK.

6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] he answered, impatiently, [...] "I like to {{have you}} put your <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> on all proper occasions; but--it isn't {{favorable}} to collected thought." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, he didn't speak," [...] Ruth explained. [...] "He {{just loved}} me, that was all. I was as {{surprised}} as you are. He didn't say a word. He just put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me.</b> And--and I was not myself. And he kissed me, and I kissed him. I couldn't help it. I just had to. And then I knew I loved him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Herman {{found the}} solo part frighteningly difficult, {{and did not}} feel that Stravinsky had really adapted his writing to the {{jazz-band}} idiom. Instead, he [...] "wrote pure Stravinsky", and the band did not feel at all comfortable with the score initially. [...] "After the very first rehearsal, at which we were all so embarrassed we were nearly crying because nobody could read, he walked over and put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'Ah, what a beautiful family you have.'" ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, in {{the fading}} light, she flung her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> {{pressing}} me tightly, desperately.|$|E
60|$|She put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> {{so tight}} as almost to hurt me. And thus we {{remained}} until again I must have fallen asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tis {{then your}} breast, no longer cold, [...] With equal ardour seems to burn, [...] While close your <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> fold, [...] Your lips my kiss with warmth return.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, but, Sam! that wasn't {{the worst}} of it," [...] went on the girl; and now she blushed painfully and hung her head. [...] "Then he started up on this side road and he ran the car as fast as ever. I was dreadfully scared, but he only laughed {{and told me to}} enjoy myself, and when the car bumped over some stones, and I was thrown against him, he put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and--and he did his best to kiss me!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In September 1972, Flack {{was opening}} for Marvin Gaye at the Greek Theater; after {{performing}} her prepared encore song, Flack was advised by Gaye to sing an additional song. Flack later said, [...] "I said well, I got this song I've {{been working on}} called 'Killing Me Softly...' and he said 'Do it, baby.' And I did it and the audience went crazy, and {{he walked over to}} me and put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'Baby, don't ever do that song again live until you record it.|$|R
5000|$|While {{some people}} loved Simon's reviews in New York {{magazine}} and others hated them, many {{were quick to}} change positions, depending on {{what he thought of}} their latest work. Interviewed for The Paris Review, Simon described a photo taken with producer Joseph Papp who had [...] "his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> after I've given him a good review, and asked for the picture back the next month because of a bad review." [...] Lynn Redgrave and John Clark were particularly happy with his review of Shakespeare for My Father, then about to debut on Broadway.|$|R
60|$|So {{with advice}} and {{guidance}} both for {{this world and}} the next did my mother, with her soft, warm <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> prepare me for the great step which lay before me.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{save you}} from the devil, of course, Baas," [...] he replied aptly. Then, resting the gun against the stone, the old fellow knelt down by my side and, {{throwing}} his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> began to blubber over me, exclaiming: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't cry, dearie," [...] {{said the}} young lady in a very {{different}} voice from the one she had used before. She sat down beside me and put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "We'll take you over to Marsden if you've got off at the wrong station." ...|$|E
5000|$|I often wonder {{just how}} mother really feels about me. God knows I love her {{as my own}} {{and try to do}} just what she wants but so often little things meet with such discouragement that I hate to try again. I know I'm not the model {{daughter}} but when I kind of look around, I don't see any other daughters (real daughters, too) do what I try to do for Mother. Just little things mothers usually appreciate. Gee, how good it would feel to have Mother put her <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> or give me a little kiss! …But I guess we are just too different.-April 18, 1935 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. It {{would never}} have done to have gone on in our gay dresses, and Tippoo's badges. These are the clothes we came up in, and we shall attract no {{attention}} whatever. You won't have to ride far, today. It will be as well for you to keep to your own horse, until we have passed through Ryacotta, which is {{not much more than}} half a mile away. After that, you must sit on this pad I have fastened behind my saddle. You can sit sideways, you know, and put your <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> just as ladies used to ride in England, a couple of hundred years ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|Emily met me {{in tears}} in the passage. [...] "Harold! Harold!" [...] she cried, flinging her <b>arms</b> wildly <b>around</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Oh, my darling! my darling! how can I ever {{say it to}} you? Mamma says she won't allow me to see you here any longer." ...|$|R
60|$|I gulped and {{the tears}} sprang into my eyes; whereupon Terence, in {{defiance}} of all military laws, laid his gun against the doorpost and put his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> and I confided my fears. It was at this critical juncture that {{the door opened and}} Colonel Clark came out.|$|E
60|$|I {{think that}} tears have a {{softening}} effect. I had steeled my heart against my lover, {{and yet he}} conquered. I felt his strong <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> and his lips were pressed against my wet cheeks. Oh! for strength to thrust him from me--to deny my love, but I could not.|$|E
60|$|It {{goes without}} saying that the door was opened very {{suddenly}} when I whispered my name, and on feeling her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> I was so heartened that it seemed as if I could successfully encounter any ordinary number of Tories or red-coats who might seek to make me prisoner.|$|E
5000|$|Sherman {{became a}} {{licensed}} jockey in 1957. [...] His first win was at Hollywood Park. [...] In 1959, {{he won a}} race in Maryland where then Vice President Richard Nixon awarded the trophy, attracting national attention. [...] The highlight of Sherman's career came when he beat his idol and future Hall of Fame jockey Eddie Arcaro in a race. [...] "I'll never forget that because after the race he came by and put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'You run a good race, son,'" [...] Sherman recalled. [...] He won over 2,000 races during his riding career. [...] After riding for over 21 years, he retired from riding as a jockey and began training horses.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, I {{lay on the}} bed, and {{the wind}} drew in from the sea and just lifted the window-curtain, and I could see the sea shining and hear the waves making a {{pleasant}} little dash, and then my head seemed to swim. I thought I was walking out by the pleasant shore, and everything seemed so strangely beautiful, and grandpapa and grandmamma were there, and Moses had come home, and you were there, {{and we were all}} so happy. And then I felt a sort of strange sense that something was coming--some great trial or affliction--and I groaned and clung to Moses, and asked him to put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and hold me.|$|R
60|$|All that day, in {{the teeth}} of a keen winter wind, I hugged myself in my plaid, and it was as though her <b>arms</b> were flung <b>around</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Harold!" [...] Emily cried, flinging her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> wildly, [...] "it's all {{my fault}}! It's my fault only! By my foolish stupidity I've lost your case. I've sent you to prison. Oh, Harold, I can never forgive myself. I've sent you to prison. I've sent you to prison." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Brave!" [...] she repudiated. [...] "I love you. I {{never knew}} how much, how really much, I loved you as when I was losing you. And now let's work for shore. I want you all alone with me, your <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> while I tell you all you are to me and shall always be to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{came to me}} suddenly." [...] She was {{speaking}} very slowly, her eyes warm and fluttery and melting, a soft flush on her cheeks that did not go away. [...] "I never knew until just now when--you put your <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me.</b> And I never expected to marry you, Martin, not until just now. How did you make me love you?" ...|$|E
60|$|I stooped down, and her <b>arms</b> were {{suddenly}} <b>around</b> <b>me</b> like a vise. She clung {{to me with}} her whole body, and held me so that I could scarcely breathe.|$|R
6000|$|The girl Foulata wrung {{her hands}} in anguish, and cried out aloud, [...] "Oh, cruel! and I so young! What have I done that I should never again see the sun rise out of the night, or the stars come {{following}} on his track in the evening, that I may no more gather the flowers when the dew is heavy, or listen to the laughing of the waters? Woe is me, that I shall never see my father's hut again, nor feel my mother's kiss, nor tend the lamb that is sick! Woe is me, that no lover shall put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and look into my eyes, nor shall men children be born of me! Oh, cruel, cruel!" ...|$|R
60|$|A surgeon came in {{to dress}} the wounded soldier, and I learned that it was two in the afternoon. My {{headache}} was no better, and the surgeon paused from his work long enough {{to give me a}} powerful drug that would depress the heart and bring relief. I slept again, and the next I knew I was on top of the building. The immediate fighting had ceased, and I was watching the balloon attack on the fortresses. Some one had an <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and I was leaning close against him. It came to me quite {{as a matter of course}} that this was Ernest, and I found myself wondering how he had got his hair and eyebrows so badly singed.|$|R
6000|$|And then I mounted and she bound me [...] With her triumphing <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> [...] And {{whispering}} to herself enwound me; [...] But when the horse had felt my weight, [...] He shook himself and neighed three times: [...] Caolte, Conan, and Finn came near, [...] And wept, and raised their lamenting hands, [...] And bid me stay, with many a tear; [...] But we rode {{out from the}} human lands.|$|E
6000|$|... "The result {{might not}} have been {{disastrous}} to me," [...] he said; [...] "for although I have always avoided military matters as much as possible, I was probably better versed in the use of a sword than he was. But I did not care to kill him, and from what I heard of him afterward, I am sure that if he had ever got those long <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> I should have been a mass of broken bones.|$|E

He struck my chains, {{and gently}} spake and smiled; [...] 1360 As they were {{loosened}} by that Hermit old, Mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled, To answer those kind looks; he did enfold His giant <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> to uphold My wretched frame; my scorched limbs he wound [...] 1365 In linen moist and balmy, and as cold As dew to drooping leaves;--the chain, with sound Like earthquake, through the chasm of that steep stair did bound, ...|$|E
40|$|My Darling: I got {{two letters}} from you today. One of them only 8 days old. It seems amazing that I could have {{something}} that you had {{such a short time}} ago. I’m sorry mail to you isn’t so good, but it really is understandable when they have to carry in so many supplies etc. Anyway I have been writing quite often so I hope they all catch up with you eventually. It is wonderful to be able to send you sentences that you will sometime read. 2 ̆ 6 it’s very wonderful to get letters from you reminding me that you love me and that we’re both looking forward to the same things.

60|$|I {{dropped my}} arm for a moment, {{and a moment}} only. Again the knife was raised, and Wolf Larsen would have surely died had she not stepped between. Her <b>arms</b> were <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> her hair was {{brushing}} my face. My pulse rushed up in an unwonted manner, yet my rage mounted with it. She looked me bravely in the eyes.|$|R
60|$|Some of {{the women}} began to cry. My father came out into the hall, closing the room door behind him, and ordered them to be quiet, so sternly that they were stunned into silence. The furious ringing was repeated; and, this time, threats mingled among the hoarse shouts. My mother's <b>arm</b> {{tightened}} <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> and I could hear the beating of her heart.|$|R
