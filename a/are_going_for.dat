Throughout the country the demand for tickets was very strong".|$|E

When speaking on her relationship with Offset, Cardi B told The Fader, [...] "It’s been a blessing, me meeting him and meeting his friends. I see how hard they work. And that motivated me to work even harder. And I see how good things <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>for</b> them and how popping {{it is to be}} number one. And I’m like, I want that. A lot of people just see they jewelry and they money, but I don’t {{think a lot of people}} see how hard they work for that shit every single day."

2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Variety said, [...] "he flying {{action has}} a casual flip buoyancy, {{and the movie}} does get you rooting for Peter. The appeal of this {{particular}} Spider-Boy is all too basic: In his lunge for valor, he keeps falling, and he keeps getting up." [...] Mike Ryan of Uproxx praised the film's light tone and performances, writing: [...] "Spider-Man: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie to date. That does come with a caveat that Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man 2 <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>for</b> different things and both are great. But, tonally, I just love this incarnation of a Peter Parker who just loves being Spider-Man." [...] The New York Timess Manohla Dargis stated, [...] "Mr. Holland looks and sounds more like a teen than the actors who’ve previously suited up for this series, and he has fine support from a cast that includes Jacob Batalon as Peter’s best friend. Other good company includes Donald Glover, as a wrong-time, wrong-place criminal, and Martin Starr, who plays his teacher role with perfect deadpan timing." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "The best thing about Spider-Man: Homecoming is Spidey is still more of a kid than a man. Even with his budding superpowers, {{he still has the}} impatience, the awkwardness, the passion, the uncertainty and sometimes the dangerous ambition of a teenager {{still trying to figure out}} this world." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a [...] "mixed" [...] review, praising the stunt work and calling Michael Keaton's performance as the Vulture [...] "one of the strongest, most sympathetic villains of the entire series," [...] but criticizing the direction by Jon Watts as [...] "unevenly orchestrated".|$|E
