50|$|Fuel {{injection}} {{control is}} digitaly electronic. It {{is based on}} the measurement engine load (this signal is provided by the <b>Air</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Sensor),</b> and on engine speed (signal provided by the hall sender in the distributor).

50|$|For most cars, air {{induction}} {{to the point}} where the air meets either the carburetor or mass <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor</b> is unrestricted by the rules, so cars may be prepared with improved air intakes. Exhaust systems are also unrestricted, so exhaust systems including headers may be modified. Cars may have to remain under a maximum noise level, so mufflers might still be needed.|$|E
5000|$|The 24-valve DOHC 4.0 L (3980 cc) version {{replaced}} the 3.6 L AJ6 in 1989. It featured a longer 102 mm stroke, and generated [...] power and 392 Nm of torque. The 4.0L engines {{as used in}} the 1990-1994 XJ40 cars continued with the crank sensor and empty distributor type of ignition system and the hot-wire Mass <b>Air</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>sensor</b> type of fuel injection control system as the 1988-1989 3.6L XJ40 cars.|$|E

50|$|The VAF (volume <b>air</b> <b>flow)</b> <b>sensor</b> {{measures}} the air {{flow into the}} engine with a spring-loaded air vane (flap/door) attached to a variable resistor (potentiometer). The vane moves {{in proportion to the}} airflow. A voltage is applied to the potentiometer and a proportional voltage appears on the output terminal of the potentiometer in proportion to the angle the vane rotates, or the movement of the vane may directly regulate the amount of fuel injected, as in the K-Jetronic system.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we design an {{adaptive}} air charge estimator for turbocharged diesel engines using intake manifold pressure, temperature and engine speed measurements. This adaptive observer scheme {{does not depend}} on mass <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensors</b> and can be applied to diesel engines with no exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). The performance of the adaptive scheme is shown in simulations to be comparable to conventional air charge estimation schemes if perfect temperature measurements are available. The designed scheme cannot estimate fast transients and its performance deteriorates with temperature sensor lags. Despite all these difficulties, this paper demonstrates that (i) the proposed scheme has better robustness to modelling errors because it provides a closed-loop observer design, and (ii) robust air charge estimation is achievable even without <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensors</b> if good (fast) temperature sensors become available. Finally, we provide a rigorous proof and present the implementation challenges as well as the limiting factors of this adaptation scheme and point to hardware and temperature sensor requirements.

40|$|In recent years, {{autonomous}} miniature airships {{have gained}} {{increased interest in}} the robotics community. Whereas their advantage lies in their abilities to move safely and to hover for extended periods of time, they {{at the same time}} are challenging as their payload is strictly limited and as their complex second-order kinematics makes the prediction of their pose and velocity through physical simulation difficult and imprecise. In this paper, we consider the problem of particle filter based online localization for a miniature blimp with lightweight ultrasound and <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensors</b> as well as an IMU. We present probabilistic models dedicated to the special characteristics of the miniature and lightweight sensors applied on our blimp. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient odometry motion model based on the measurements of <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensors</b> and an IMU which is less computationally demanding compared to the standard physical simulation-based control motion model. In experiments with a real blimp in a complex indoor environment, our approach has proven to allow accurate and reliable online localization of a miniature blimp and requires an order of magnitude fewer particles compared to the localization based on the standard control motion model. Furthermore, we demonstrate the substantial improvements in terms of localization accuracy when taking into account the temporal correlation of the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> measurements in our novel odometry motion model...|$|R
50|$|Note: Carburetors {{are largely}} {{dependent}} on <b>air</b> volume <b>flow</b> and vacuum, and neither directly infers mass. Consequently, carburetors are precise, but not accurate fuel metering devices.

5000|$|Most modern engines {{use some}} type of fuel {{injection}} to deliver fuel to the cylinders. The ECU determines the amount of fuel to inject based {{on a number of}} sensor readings. Oxygen sensors tell the ECU whether the engine is running rich (too much fuel/too little oxygen) or running lean (too much oxygen/too little fuel) as compared to ideal conditions (known as stoichiometric). The throttle position sensors tell the ECU how far the throttle plate is opened when you press the accelerator. The mass <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor</b> measures the amount of air flowing into the engine through the throttle plate. The engine coolant temperature sensor measures whether the engine is warmed up or cool. (If the engine is still cool, additional fuel will be injected.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The 3.6 was {{the first}} AJ6 engine, debuting in 1983 on the XJ-S. It had DOHC 4-valve heads with a 91 mm bore and 92 mm stroke. Power was [...] with 325 Nm of torque. Power was reduced to [...] for {{versions}} having catalytic exhaust system. Early versions of the 3.6L AJ6 as used in the 1984 - 1987 XJ-S cars had a conventional distributor type of ignition system with electronics within the distributor body. This early AJ6 ignition system is nearly identical to the system used on the XK engine in the Series III XJ6 cars. The Lucas fuel injection system on the 3.6L AJ6 engines in these early XJ-S cars sensed engine load using a Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor just like the V12 cars from the same era. Later 3.6L AJ6 engines as used in the 1986-1989 XJ40 cars had a crank-sensor type of ignition system with a bare distributor that only carried the spinning ignition rotor inside the distributor cap. The fuel-injection system used on the later 3.6L AJ6 engines used a hot-wire Mass <b>Air</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>sensor</b> to determine engine load.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fifth-generation}} 4A-GE engine {{produced from}} 1995 to 2000 {{is the final}} version of the 4A-GE engine and has black cam covers. It uses Toyota Variable Valve Timing (VVT) system on the intake cam. This engine is commonly known as the [...] "black top" [...] due to the color of the valve cover, and yet again features an even higher compression ratio (11:1). The <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor</b> is replaced with a MAP sensor, the diameter of the four individual throttle bodies was increased from 43 mm to 45 mm, the exhaust port diameter was increased, the intake cam lift was increased from 7.9 mm to 8.2 mm and the intake ports were significantly improved in shape, contour and also the width at opening at the head was increased. Additionally, the black top had a lighter flywheel, a larger plenum, lighter connecting rods and revised rubber velocity stacks, and was also offered in 1997 with a six-speed C160 transaxle. This revision increased the power to [...] at 7,800 rpm with 16.5 kgm Nm of torque at 5,600 rpm. The 'Blacktop' has become a favorite among enthusiasts and is used as an easy power upgrade for the early Toyota Corolla models, especially for use in the drift scene. Due to the relatively high state of tuning of the stock motor, most power/torque gains come from higher lift cams and engine management.|$|E
5000|$|The 302 engine {{received}} a Mass <b>Air</b> <b>Flow</b> (MAF) <b>sensor</b> system in 1993 (MY 1994). The 351 followed with MAF in 1994 (MY 1995) in California. 351s {{in the rest}} of the country received MAF in 1995 (MY 1996) along with OBD2 on both the 302 and 351.|$|R
50|$|During this {{transient}} stage, {{the engine}} control unit (ECU) on a standard turbocharged engine uses a combination of sensors such as lambda <b>sensors</b> and <b>air</b> mass <b>flow</b> <b>sensors</b> to regulate the fuel flow rate. In an HTT equipped engine the ECU can deliver the precise fuel flow rate for complete combustion more accurately. This is achieved by directly controlling the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate and boost pressure via control of the compressor speed.|$|R
50|$|The modern {{automobile}} {{air intake}} system has three main parts, an <b>air</b> filter, mass <b>flow</b> <b>sensor,</b> and throttle body. Some modern intake systems can be highly complex, and often include specially-designed intake manifolds to optimally distribute air and air/fuel mixture to each cylinder. Many cars today now include a silencer to minimize the noise entering the cabin. Silencers impede <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> and create turbulence which reduce total power, so performance enthusiasts often remove them.|$|R
5000|$|The EJ series flat-4 {{aluminium}} alloy engine, specially {{developed for the}} Legacy, was the most powerful engine Subaru had built to date, and the engine is currently offered in many configurations. In an attempt to ensure durability and longevity, Subaru chose to use five main crankshaft bearings. The engine has either single or double overhead camshaft architecture and pent-roof, cross flow cylinder firing chambers. The ignition utilized distributorless ignition, using a computer-controlled coil pack and spark plug wires to supply the electrical charge. Later versions of this engine used coil packs installed directly {{on top of the}} spark plug. Problems detected by the cars' on-board computers are signified by a [...] "check engine" [...] light, alerting the driver that maintenance is needed immediately. The air-fuel mixture is monitored by a mass <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor</b> and emissions are controlled by an oxygen sensor installed in front of a catalytic converter. It also uses reverse flow engine cooling, meaning cool water from the radiator entered the cylinder heads first and then exited through the top of the engine block back into the top of the radiator. The water flow was controlled by the thermostat which is located next to the water pump underneath the engine. Installing the thermostat in this position allows it to more accurately control the temperature of the water as it enters the engine from the cylinder heads first, thereby better preventing an occurrence of thermal shock.|$|E
5000|$|The computer, in 1993, was run via Speed Density, which {{measured}} {{engine speed}} (RPM) and load (MAP in kPa) to compute airflow requirements {{and then use}} that against the VE table to get the proper fueling for conditions. An IAT (Intake Air Temperature sensor) was also used as air density changes with temperature. In 1994 however, the computer logic was changed over to a Mass Air Flow system. This system uses a Mass <b>Air</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Sensor</b> {{placed in front of}} the throttle body to measure the incoming airflow into the motor. This is measured by using a heated wire in the sensor in the airstream path which has heat pulled away from it via the incoming air. This reduced heat is converted into a voltage signal which is sent to the PCM which then converts that voltage signal into mass flow. The computer uses engine sensors to judge engine conditions and provide the proper fueling off of this mass airflow reading. This {{was one of the main}} differences between the 93 and 94+ F-Body cars (and 92-93 Vette's compared to 94-96) and one of the items that makes a 93 model unique. Another prominent difference between the [...] "Speed Density" [...] 93's and the 94+ cars is how the programming (or custom tuning) of the computer takes place. In 1993, the stock computer uses a Memcal chip, which is a removable chip from the computer. Contained in this chip is the program for the car to run. In the 1994+ cars, this was swapped to a non-removable reflashable chip, which could be reprogrammed via the Assembly Line Diagnostic Link, or ALDL, located underneath the driver side of the dash, next to the center console. Many people view this as a more user-friendly and easier way to tune the vehicle.|$|E

40|$|The Continues Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) {{therapy is}} the most popular noninvasive therapy used to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnoea {{symptoms}} (OSA). Recent sleep clinic research requires more CPAP functions during patient s sleep periods. It would be an advantage to operate the CPAP system at a lower pressure whilst monitoring the patient s air flow, and raise the pressure as the OSA is detected, rather than maintaining a fixed higher minimum pressure in order to reduce OSA symptoms. In order to detect OSA, an <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor</b> is considered ideally suited to assemble within the CPAP system and the characteristics of this type of sensors are investigated by creating and validating a mathematical model. Before determining the most suitable type of <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor,</b> several common methods of air flow measurement were investigated. Ultrasonic and hot wire air flow sensors were considered to be the most suitable sensors to be implemented. After setting up the simulation model and conducting experiments, some limitations of ultrasonic <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor</b> were found, so the hot wire sensor was selected for further investigation. Comparing the performances of three types of hot wire sensor, Constant Voltage (CV), Constant Current (CC) and Constant Temperature (CT), the CT hot wire sensor was found to be the most suitable type for CPAP systems. In order to achieve a precise measurement, different locations for the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor</b> within CPAP system were investigated and the blower inlet was found to be the best location for <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor.</b> The simulation CT model hot wire sensor was developed. The experimental results were compared to the simulation model results. Comparison of the two results showed less than 1. 5 % error when the air flow velocity exceeded 1. 0 m/s (Average air speed is 5. 0 m/s from the CPAP Blower). Environmental conditions of temperature, humidity and wire property effects were analysed by processing the simulation model under different conditions. The following conclusions were drawn out: The output current to the hot wire <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor</b> rise significantly as the hot wire diameter increases, however, the sensor response time increases significantly. It was found that platinum wire of a diameter 0. 02 mm can meet the response time requirement for diagnosis of sleep disorders. Various wire lengths produce no significant effect on both aspects of output wire current and response time. Therefore wire length can be designed to fit the inlet channel of the CPAP blower. Higher wire temperature causes higher wire current flow at the same air flow velocity, however, lower wire temperatures achieve a faster response speed. The temperature range of 50 to 100 oC over ambient was found to be an optional setting. To achieve the desired level of accuracy a temperature compensation circuit was required for the hot wire <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor.</b> Otherwise it was necessary to keep the sensor in a stable room temperature environment to gain the same result. The percentage error of ambient temperature was about 0. 65 % per oC...|$|E
