5|$|Behavioural and neuropsychiatric changes {{become more}} prevalent. Common manifestations are wandering, {{irritability}} and labile affect, leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated aggression, or resistance to caregiving. Sundowning can also appear. Approximately 30% {{of people with}} AD develop illusionary misidentifications and other delusional symptoms. Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations (<b>anosognosia).</b> Urinary incontinence can develop. These symptoms create stress for relatives and carers, which can be reduced by moving the person from home care to other long-term care facilities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anosognosia</b> {{is a lack}} of {{awareness}} or understanding of the loss of function caused by the brain injury and is common in individuals who have suffered a right hemisphere stroke. Because patients with <b>anosognosia</b> may be unaware of their deficits, they may be less likely to seek treatment once they are released from the hospital. The lack of proper treatment could lead to higher levels of dependency later on. In order to make functional recovery gains, right hemisphere stroke survivors should receive rehabilitation services, so patients with <b>anosognosia</b> should be encouraged to seek out additional treatment. However, due to the <b>anosognosia,</b> these patients often report a higher perceived quality of life than other right hemisphere stroke survivors because of the unawareness of the resulting deficits (Daia et al., 2014). Patients with smaller lesions often recover faster from <b>anosognosia</b> than patients with larger lesions resulting in <b>anosognosia</b> (Hier et al., 1983).|$|E
25|$|Cognitive deficits {{resulting}} from stroke include perceptual disorders, aphasia, dementia, and problems with attention and memory. A stroke sufferer may {{be unaware of}} his or her own disabilities, a condition called <b>anosognosia.</b> In a condition called hemispatial neglect, the affected person is unable to attend to anything on the side of space opposite to the damaged hemisphere.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} disorders of consciousness goes by the name <b>anosognosia,</b> a Greek-derived term meaning unawareness of disease. [...] This is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way, most commonly {{as a result of a}} stroke, but either misunderstand the nature of the problem or deny that there is anything wrong with them. [...] The most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the right hemisphere of the brain, giving rise to a syndrome known as hemispatial neglect, characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move. [...] When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies: [...] one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him. [...] An even more striking type of <b>anosognosia</b> is Anton–Babinski syndrome, a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.|$|E
2500|$|Patients {{with right}} {{hemisphere}} brain damage most commonly have difficulties with attention, perception, learning, memory, recognition and expression of emotion, and neglect. Other frequently occurring, though slightly less common, deficits include reasoning and problem solving, awareness, and orientation. It is also common {{for patients with}} right hemisphere damage to have a flat affect, lack of emotional expression, while speaking. [...] Additionally, these patients commonly have difficulty recognizing other people's emotions when expressed through facial expressions and tone of voice. Although these deficits alone may complicate therapy, the patient may also exhibit <b>anosognosia,</b> or ignorance {{of his or her}} impairments. Due to possible <b>anosognosia,</b> it is common for patients to not become frustrated or upset when they are unable to complete tasks they were previously able to complete.|$|E
2500|$|Pain {{associated}} with Dejerine–Roussy syndrome is sometimes coupled with <b>anosognosia</b> or somatoparaphrenia which causes a patient having undergone a right-parietal, or right-sided stroke to deny any paralysis {{of the left}} side when indeed there is, or deny the paralyzed limb(s) belong to them. Although debatable, these symptoms are rare and considered part of a [...] "thalamic phenomenon", and are not normally considered a characteristic of Dejerine–Roussy syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Anosognosia,</b> {{a lack of}} {{awareness}} of the deficit, is common and can cause therapeutic resistance. [...] In some agnosias, such as prosopagnosia, awareness of the deficit is often present; however shame and embarrassment regarding the symptoms can be a barrier in admission of a deficiency. [...] Because agnosias result from brain lesions, no direct treatment for them currently exists, and intervention is aimed at utilization of coping strategies by patients and those around them. [...] Sensory compensation can also develop after one modality is impaired in agnostics ...|$|E
2500|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} from functional neuroimaging studies, {{as well as}} lesion studies in neurological patients indicates that the right inferior parietal cortex, at the junction with the posterior temporal cortex (TPJ, temporoparietal junction), plays {{a critical role in}} the distinction between self-produced actions and actions perceived in others. Lesions of this region can produce a variety of disorders associated with body knowledge and self-awareness such as <b>anosognosia,</b> asomatognosia, or somatoparaphrenia. [...] A primary source has reported that electrical stimulation of the TPJ can elicit out-of-body experiences (i.e., the experience of dissociation of self from the body).|$|E
2500|$|The {{imbalance}} in sensation characterized by Dejerine–Roussy syndrome {{can be argued}} through a model addressing a system of inputs and outputs that the brain must constantly process throughout life, suggesting latent plasticity. The right and left hemispheres of the brain both play important roles in the sensory input and output. When a stroke damages one hemisphere, it is proposed that the other hemisphere will cope with the discrepancies in a specific manner. The left hemisphere tends to [...] "gloss over" [...] discrepancies from inputs, eliciting either denial or rationalization defense mechanisms in order to stabilize said discrepancy. In contrast, the right hemisphere does the opposite, and {{will focus on the}} discrepancy, and motivate action to be taken to restore equilibrium. Therefore, damage to the left hemisphere can cause both an indifference to pain and hypersensitivity to pain (dysaesthesia or allodynia), while damage to the right hemisphere can cause denial as a defense mechanism (<b>anosognosia</b> and somatoparaphrenia).|$|E
2500|$|Initially many {{individuals}} with a form of agnosia are unaware {{of the extent to}} which they have either a perceptual or recognition deficit. [...] This may be caused by <b>anosognosia</b> which is the lack of awareness of a deficit. [...] This lack of awareness usually leads to a form of denial and resistance to any form of help or treatment. [...] There are various methods that can be used which can help the individual recognize the impairment in perception or recognition that they may have. [...] A patient can be presented with a stimulus to the impaired modality only to help increase their awareness of their deficit. [...] Alternatively, a task can be broken down into its component parts so that the individual can see each part of the problem caused by the deficit. [...] Once the individual acknowledges their perceptual or recognition deficit, a form of treatment may be recommended. [...] There are various forms of treatment such as compensatory strategies with alternate modalities, verbal strategies, alternate cues and organizational strategies.|$|E
50|$|When {{assessing}} {{the causes of}} <b>anosognosia</b> within stroke patients, CT scans {{have been used to}} assess where the greatest amount of damage is found within the various areas of the brain. Stroke patients with mild and severe levels of <b>anosognosia</b> (determined by response to an <b>anosognosia</b> questionnaire) have been linked to lesions within the temporoparietal and thalamic regions, when compared to those who experience moderate <b>anosognosia,</b> or none at all. In contrast, after a stroke, people with moderate <b>anosognosia</b> have a higher frequency of lesions involving the basal ganglia, compared to those with mild or severe <b>anosognosia.</b>|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} {{studies showing that}} the {{maneuver}} of vestibular stimulation could temporarily improve both the syndrome of spatial unilateral neglect and of <b>anosognosia</b> for left hemiplegia. Combining the findings of hemispheric asymmetry to the right, association with spatial unilateral neglect, and the temporal improvement on both syndromes, it is suggested {{there can be a}} spatial component underlying the mechanism of <b>anosognosia</b> for motor weakness and that neural processes could be modulated similarly. There were some cases of <b>anosognosia</b> for right hemiplegia after left hemisphere damage, but the frequency of this type of <b>anosognosia</b> has not been estimated.|$|E
5000|$|Somatoparaphrenia {{has been}} {{reported}} to occur predominately in the left arm of one's body, and it is often accompanied by left-sided paralysis and <b>anosognosia</b> (denial or lack of awareness) of the paralysis. The link between somatoparaphrenia and paralysis has been documented in many clinical cases [...] and while the question arises as to whether paralysis is necessary for somatoparaphrenia to occur, <b>anosognosia</b> is not, as documented by cases with somatoparaphrenia and paralysis with no <b>anosognosia.</b>|$|E
50|$|A similar {{situation}} can happen on patients with <b>anosognosia</b> for cognitive deficits after {{traumatic brain injury}} when monitoring their errors during the tasks regarding their memory and attention (online emergent awareness) and when predicting their performance right before the same tasks (online anticipatory awareness). It can also occur among patients with dementia and <b>anosognosia</b> for memory deficit when prompted with dementia-related words, showing possible pre-attentive processing and implicit knowledge of their memory problems. More interestingly, patients with <b>anosognosia</b> may overestimate their performance when asked in first-person formed questions but not from a third-person perspective when the questions referring to others.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anosognosia</b> is {{relatively}} common following different causes of brain injury, such as stroke and traumatic brain injury; for example, <b>anosognosia</b> for hemiparesis, (weakness of {{one side of}} the body) with onset of acute stroke is estimated at between 10% and 18%. However, it can appear to occur in conjunction with virtually any neurological impairment. It is more frequent in the acute than in the chronic phase and more prominent for assessment in the cases with right hemispheric lesions than with the left. <b>Anosognosia</b> is not related to global mental confusion, cognitive flexibility, other major intellectual disturbances, or mere sensory/perceptual deficits.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anosognosia,</b> a {{condition}} in which a person is unaware or in denial of an illness.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anosognosia</b> can be {{selective}} in that an affected person with multiple impairments may seem unaware {{of only one}} handicap, while appearing to be fully aware of any others. This {{is consistent with the}} idea that the source of the problem relates to spatial representation of the body. For example, <b>anosognosia</b> for hemiplegia, or the paralysis of one side of the body, may occur with or without intact awareness of visuo-spatial unilateral neglect. This phenomenon of double dissociation can be an indicator of domain-specific disorders of awareness modules, meaning that in <b>anosognosia,</b> brain damage can selectively impact the self-monitoring process of one specific physical or cognitive function rather than a spatial location of the body.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anosognosia</b> ( [...] , from Ancient Greek ἀ- a-, [...] "without", νόσος nosos, [...] "disease" [...] and γνῶσις gnōsis, [...] "knowledge") is {{a deficit}} of self-awareness, a {{condition}} in which a person with some disability seems unaware of its existence. It was first named by the neurologist Joseph Babinski in 1914. <b>Anosognosia</b> results from physiological damage to brain structures, typically to the parietal lobe or a diffuse lesion on the fronto-temporal-parietal area in the right hemisphere, and is thus a neurological disorder. While this distinguishes the condition from denial, which is a psychological defense mechanism, attempts have been made at a unified explanation. <b>Anosognosia</b> is sometimes accompanied by asomatognosia, a form of neglect in which patients deny ownership of their limbs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anosognosia</b> {{for when}} the {{opposite}} happens and {{a person with a}} disability denies that they have one.|$|E
50|$|Clinically, <b>anosognosia</b> {{is often}} {{assessed}} by giving patients an <b>anosognosia</b> questionnaire {{in order to}} assess their metacognitive knowledge of deficits. However, neither of the existing questionnaires applied in the clinics are designed thoroughly for evaluating the multidimensional nature of this clinical phenomenon; nor are the responses obtained via offline questionnaire capable of revealing the discrepancy of awareness observed from their online task performance. The discrepancy is noticed when patients showed no awareness of their deficits from the offline responses to the questionnaire but demonstrated reluctance or verbal circumlocution when asked to perform an online task. For example, patients with <b>anosognosia</b> for hemiplegia may find excuses not to perform a bimanual task even though they do not admit it is because of their paralyzed arms.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Anosognosia</b> {{may occur}} {{as part of}} {{receptive}} aphasia, a language disorder that causes poor comprehension of speech {{and the production of}} fluent but incomprehensible sentences. A patient with receptive aphasia cannot correct his own phonetics errors and shows [...] "anger and disappointment with the person with whom s/he is speaking because that person fails to understand her/him". This may be a result of brain damage to the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus, believed to contain representations of word sounds. With those representations significantly distorted, patients with receptive aphasia are unable to monitor their mistakes. Other patients with receptive aphasia are fully aware of their condition and speech inhibitions, but cannot monitor their condition, which {{is not the same as}} <b>anosognosia</b> and therefore cannot explain the occurrence of neologistic jargon.|$|E
5000|$|In {{regard to}} <b>anosognosia</b> for {{neurological}} patients, no long-term treatments exist. As with unilateral neglect, caloric reflex testing (squirting ice cold {{water into the}} left ear) is known to temporarily ameliorate unawareness of impairment. It is not entirely clear how this works, although {{it is thought that}} the unconscious shift of attention or focus caused by the intense stimulation of the vestibular system temporarily influences awareness. Most cases of <b>anosognosia</b> appear to simply disappear over time, while other cases can last indefinitely. Normally, long-term cases are treated with cognitive therapy to train patients to adjust for their inoperable limbs (though it is believed that these patients still are not [...] "aware" [...] of their disability). Another commonly used method is the use of feedback - comparing clients' self-predicted performance with their actual performance on a task in an attempt to improve insight.|$|E
