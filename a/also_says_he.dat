500|$|Adams {{first thought}} about drawing comics professionally while in high school, {{when he bought}} Marvel Comics' Micronauts #1, which was {{illustrated}} by Michael Golden, the first artist Adams noticed significantly.

In a 1997 interview, Adams responded to the observation that fans had noticed a manga influence in his work by stating that he had likely been influenced by Masamune Shirow.

After a female classmate Adams was attracted to talked him into joining the acting club, Adams also considered becoming an actor, eventually doing community theater for two years. He quit acting when he turned 19, in order to concentrate on drawing.|$|E

2500|$|Carpenter's journal {{during this}} time period confuses some of the Spanish ships engaged and events. This {{indicates}} they were written soon after the battle.

2500|$|Dick {{attended}} Berkeley High School in Berkeley, California. He {{and fellow}} science fiction author Ursula K.

After graduation, he briefly attended the University of California, Berkeley, (September 1949 to November 11, 1949) with an honorable dismissal granted January 1, 1950. Dick did not declare a major and took classes in history, psychology, philosophy, and zoology. Through his studies in philosophy, he believed that existence is based on internal human perception, which does not necessarily correspond to external reality; he described himself as [...] "an acosmic panentheist," [...] believing in the universe only as an extension of God. [...] After reading the works of Plato and pondering the possibilities of metaphysical realms, Dick came to the conclusion that, in a certain sense, the world is not entirely real {{and there is no way}} to confirm whether it is truly there. This question from his early studies persisted as a theme in many of his novels. Dick dropped out because of ongoing anxiety problems, according to his third wife Anne's memoir. She <b>also</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> disliked the mandatory ROTC training. At Berkeley, Dick befriended poet Robert Duncan and poet and linguist Jack Spicer, who gave Dick ideas for a Martian language. Dick claimed to have hosted a classical music program on KSMO Radio in 1947. From 1948 to 1952, Dick worked at Art Music Company, a record store on Telegraph Avenue.|$|E
