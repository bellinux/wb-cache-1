5|$|The NCAA {{considers}} all paid fantasy games—including daily fantasy—to {{fall under}} its prohibition of sports wagering by student athletes, punishable by ineligibility {{to participate in}} NCAA-sanctioned athletics for one year. <b>Advertising</b> <b>for</b> daily fantasy services are also forbidden from being broadcast during telecasts of the NCAA's tournaments.

The SEC had discussions with its broadcast partners in an attempt to discourage the advertising of daily fantasy games during its telecasts, while both Big Ten Network and Pac-12 Network prohibited <b>advertising</b> <b>for</b> daily fantasy games involving college sports. On December 9, 2015, it was reported that ESPN had similarly agreed not to air <b>advertising</b> <b>for</b> daily fantasy services during telecasts of the College Football Playoff.

5|$|The single reel drama, 957 feet long, was {{released}} on May 13, 1910. Whether the film is 957 feet or 950 feet long is subject to debate. Bowers notes that some sources state the film is 950 feet long, one such example is the <b>advertising</b> <b>for</b> the film which lists it as being approximately this length. <b>Advertising</b> <b>for</b> the film recognized negativity of Friday the 13th {{and used it to}} promote the film to redefine the date to instead bring joy. The film was shown across the United States, advertisements for the showing included theaters in Kansas, Texas, and Pennsylvania. Identifying the theaters showing this work is complicated by the identically named The Best Man Wins by Vitagraph. The silent western produced in 1909 was still being shown and advertised in theaters {{at the time of the}} release of Thanhouser's film.

5|$|<b>Advertising</b> <b>for</b> the {{permanent}} reintroduction of Chicken Fries in early 2015 was again shaped {{around a large}} digital-media push headed by its new advertising firm David. However, unlike the 2014 promotion that was almost exclusively digitally-oriented, the 2015 promotion was accompanied with a sizable television and media tie-in to the annual NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship tournament. In the host city of Indianapolis, Burger King sponsored Chicken Fries-branded SUVs that would give free rides to visitors. A series of advertisements for the product and the company's 2 for $5 sandwich promotion ran during the tournament featuring the hash tag WatchLikeaKing, along {{with a series of}} NCAA co-branded kid's meals.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{has also}} {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} new cultural forms. Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example would feature an image of a baseball player on one side and <b>advertising</b> <b>for</b> a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.|$|E
