5000|$|The first {{source of}} error is the {{sampling}} error. Pipelines operate at high pressure.

Suppliers can provide appropriate calibration information for other gas mixtures, however the accuracy of the thermal flow meter is dependent on the <b>actual</b> <b>gas</b> mixture being the same as the gas mixture used for calibration purposes.

5000|$|Any matter {{dissolved}} (or otherwise suspended) in the superfluid {{will tend}} to aggregate together in clumps, encapsulated by a 'quantum solvation shell'.

5000|$|In {{the case}} of GASMAS, optical {{interference}} is particularly cumbersome. This {{is related to the}} severe speckle-type interference that originates from the interaction between laser light and highly scattering solid materials. Since this highly non-uniform interference is generated in same place as the utility signal, it cannot be removed by design. The optical properties of the porous material under study determines the interference pattern, and the level of interference is not seldom much stronger than <b>actual</b> <b>gas</b> absorption signals. Random mechanical dithering (e.g. laser beam dithering and/or sample rotation [...] ) has been found effective in GASMAS. However, this approach converts stable interference into a random noise that must be averaged away, thus requiring longer acquisition times.

5000|$|It {{is useful}} {{to keep in mind}} that {{although}} the waves traverse the entire expansion chamber over each cycle, the actual gases leaving the cylinder during a particular cycle do not. The gas flows and stops intermittently and the wave continues on to the end of the pipe. The hot gases leaving the port form a [...] "slug" [...] which fills the header pipe and remains there for the duration of that cycle. This causes a high temperature zone in the head pipe which is always filled with the most recent and hottest gas. Because this area is hotter, the speed of sound and thus the speed of the waves that travel through it are increased. During the next cycle that slug of gas will be pushed down the pipe by the next slug to occupy the next zone and so on. The volume this [...] "slug" [...] occupies constantly varies according to throttle position and engine speed. It is only the wave energy itself that traverses the whole pipe during a single cycle. The <b>actual</b> <b>gas</b> leaving the pipe during a particular cycle was created two or three cycles earlier. (This is why exhaust gas sampling on two stroke engines is done with a special valve right in the exhaust port. The gas exiting the stinger has had too much resident time and mixing with gas from other cycles causing errors in analysis.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} air-breathing {{gas turbine}} jet engine was the turbojet. It was a concept {{brought to life}} by two engineers, Frank Whittle in England United Kingdom and Hans von Ohain in Germany. The turbojet compresses and heats air and then exhausts it as a high speed, high temperature jet to create thrust. While these engines are capable of giving high thrust levels, they are most efficient at very high speeds (over Mach 1), due to the low-mass-flow, high speed nature of the jet exhaust. Modern turbofans are a development of the turbojet; they are basically a turbojet that includes a new section called the fan stage. Rather than using all of its exhaust gases to provide direct thrust like a turbojet, the turbofan engine extracts some of the power from the exhaust gases inside the engine and uses it to power the fan stage. The fan stage accelerates a large volume of air through a duct, bypassing the engine core (the <b>actual</b> <b>gas</b> turbine component of the engine), and expelling it at the rear as a jet, creating thrust. A proportion of the air that comes through the fan stage enters the engine core rather than being ducted to the rear, and is thus compressed and heated; some of the energy is extracted to power the compressors and fans, while the remainder is exhausted at the rear. This high-speed, hot-gas exhaust blends with the low speed, cool-air exhaust from the fan stage, and both contribute to the overall thrust of the engine. Depending on what proportion of cool air is bypassed around the engine core, a turbofan can be called low-bypass, high-bypass, or very-high-bypass engines. Low bypass engines were the first turbofan engines produced, and provide {{the majority of their}} thrust from the hot core exhaust gases, while the fan stage only supplements this. These engines are still commonly seen on military fighter aircraft, since they provide more efficient thrust at supersonic speeds and have a narrower frontal area, minimizing aerodynamic drag. Their comparatively high noise levels and subsonic fuel consumption are deemed acceptable in such an application, whereas although the first generation of turbofan airliners used low-bypass engines, their high noise levels and fuel consumption mean they have fallen out of favor for large aircraft. High bypass engines have a much larger fan stage, and provide most of their thrust from the ducted air of the fan; the engine core provides power to the fan stage, and only a proportion of the overall thrust comes from the engine core exhaust stream. A high-bypass turbofan functions very similarly to a turboprop engine, except it uses a many-bladed fan rather than a multi-blade propeller, and relies on a duct to properly vector the airflow to create thrust. Over the last several decades, there has been a move towards very high bypass engines, which use fans far larger than the engine core itself, which is typically a modern, high efficiency two or three-spool design. This high efficiency and power is what allows such large fans to be viable, and the increased thrust available (up to 75,000lbs per engine in engines such as the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB or General Electric GENx), have allowed a move to large twin engine aircraft, such as the Airbus A350 or Boeing 777, as well as allowing twin engine aircraft to operate on long overwater routes, previously the domain of 3-engine or 4-engine aircraft.|$|E
