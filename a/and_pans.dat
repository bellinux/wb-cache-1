5|$|Parents of Amador Valley {{students}} {{became involved}} with student activities. In 1927, Pleasanton mothers decided to start a school lunch program {{to provide students with}} a better environment for learning. Parents donated pots <b>and</b> <b>pans,</b> and a newly hired cook prepared lunches, to be eaten at new tables and benches. The tables and benches were constructed by the custodian and the music teacher from wood of horse stalls formerly on the campus. This project {{led to the formation of}} a Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) chapter at Amador Valley in the late 1920s.|$|E

5|$|On October10, 1984, the Government of Cape Verde {{appealed for}} {{international}} assistance. Emergency relief aid requested included: two-month {{supply of food}} for 1,124families, 1,064mattresses, 532kerosene stoves, 2,128sets of dinner ware, 2,128mugs, 1,064cooking pots <b>and</b> <b>pans,</b> 532water buckets, 2,128sheets, 1,064blankets, 2,660articles of clothing, and building materials for repair of the 1,094houses.

Five organizations contributed cash, including the National Solidarity Movement, the Cape Verde Red Cross, Chinese Red Cross, Oxfam Novib, and Oxfam of the United Kingdom; donations collectively totaled to $172,221 (1984USD).

25|$|Pottery {{has been}} used to make {{cookware}} from before dated history. Pots <b>and</b> <b>pans</b> made with this material are durable (some could last a lifetime or more)and are inert and non-reactive. Heat is also conducted evenly in this material. They can be used for both cooking in a fire pit surrounded with coals and for baking in the oven.|$|E
25|$|Despite their price, {{as low as}} thirty pesos for a pot, much of {{traditional}} indigenous cookware is being replaced by mass-produced pots <b>and</b> <b>pans</b> in the rural areas. Fewer young people are taking up the trade, mostly because many {{want to live in}} the city. Much of pottery making in Oaxaca has switched from functional ware to decorative wares that appeal to foreign markets and tourists.|$|E

25|$|By the 17th century, it {{was common}} for a Western kitchen to contain a number of skillets, baking pans, a kettle and several pots, along {{with a variety of}} pot hooks and trivets. Brass or copper vessels were common in Asia and Europe, whilst iron pots were common in the American colonies. Improvements in {{metallurgy}} during the 19th and 20th centuries allowed for pots <b>and</b> <b>pans</b> from metals such as steel, stainless steel and aluminium to be economically produced.|$|E

25|$|Metal pots {{are made}} from a narrow range of metals because pots <b>and</b> <b>pans</b> need to conduct heat well, but {{also need to be}} {{chemically}} unreactive so that they do not alter the flavor of the food. Most materials that are conductive enough to heat evenly are too reactive to use in food preparation. In some cases (copper pots, for example), a pot may be made out of a more reactive metal, and then tinned or clad with another.|$|E
25|$|But the {{simultaneous}} {{increase in the}} availability of capital, the changing flux of technology (metallurgy), the availability of skilled foreign labour {{and the rise of}} an educated middle class meant that iron-making in the Weald would presage change across England. It would, in many ways, pave the way for the rise of the new industrial middle class. A trade consisting mostly of weapons would evolve into other more common tools as well: fire-backs, andirons, anvils, hammers, pots <b>and</b> <b>pans</b> and even grave slabs.|$|E
25|$|ICT {{appears to}} be {{vanishing}} {{as a result of}} greater genetic diversity within the affected populations in conjunction with educational programs to ensure that tinned cooking utensils are used instead of copper pots <b>and</b> <b>pans</b> being directly exposed to cooked foods. The preponderance of cases of early childhood cirrhosis identified in Germany over a period of 10 years were not associated with either external sources of copper or with elevated hepatic metal concentrations Only occasional spontaneous cases of ICT arise today.|$|E

25|$|Benvenuto Cellini worked {{almost ten}} years on this bronze (1545-1554). His wax design was {{immediately}} approved by Cosimo I de' Medici. He met numerous difficulties which, according to his autobiography, almost {{brought him to the}} brink of death. The casting of this bronze statue was several times unsuccessful. When attempting again, the melting furnace got overheated, spoiling the casting of the bronze. Cellini gave orders to feed the furnace with his household furniture and finally with about 200 pewter dishes and plates, and his pots <b>and</b> <b>pans.</b> This caused the bronze to flow again. After the bronze had cooled, the statue was finished, except for three toes on the right foot. These were added later.|$|E
25|$|Jones' {{father was}} a Southern Pacific {{railroad}} agent. Young Lindley Jones got his nickname by being so thin that he was compared to a railroad spike. At age 11 {{he got his first}} set of drums. As a teenager he played in bands that he formed himself; Jones' first band was called Spike Jones and his Five Tacks. A railroad restaurant chef taught him how to use pots <b>and</b> <b>pans,</b> forks, knives and spoons as musical instruments. Jones frequently played in theater pit orchestras. In the 1930s he joined the Victor Young orchestra and got many offers to appear on radio shows, including Al Jolson's Lifebuoy Program, Burns and Allen, and Bing Crosby's Kraft Music Hall.|$|E
25|$|From the {{beginning}} of commercialization, {{the making of a}} paper brought in most of the village's population into the process in one way or another. However, in the 1980s, many men in the area began to leave as migrant workers, mostly to the United States, sending remittances home. This then became the main source of income to San Pablito, and made paper making not only secondary, but mostly done by women. The basic equipment used are stones to beat the fibers, wooden boards <b>and</b> <b>pans</b> to boil the bark. All of these come from sources outside San Pablito. The stones come from Tlaxcala. The boards come from two nearby villages of Zoyotla and Honey and the boiling pans are obtained by local hardware stores from Tulancingo.|$|E
