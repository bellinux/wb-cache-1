25|$|The state secrets {{privilege}} {{allows the}} president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from discovery in legal proceedings if such release would harm national security. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when Thomas Jefferson refused to release military documents in the treason trial of Aaron Burr and again in Totten v. United States , when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy. However, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until United States v. Reynolds , where it was held to be a common law evidentiary privilege. Before the September 11 attacks, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency. Since 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and <b>at</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>stages</b> of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Mohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc. Critics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.|$|E

40|$|Context: Software effort {{estimation}} <b>at</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> is {{a crucial}} task for project bedding and feasibility study. Since collected data <b>at</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> of software development lifecycle is always imprecise and uncertain, {{it is very hard}} to deliver accurate estimate. Analogy-based estimation, which is one of the popular estimation methods, is rarely used <b>at</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> because of uncertainty associated with attribute measurement and data availability. Objective: in order to improve performance of analogy-based estimation <b>at</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage,</b> using all available early data, we integrated it with Fuzzy numbers. Particularly, this paper proposes a new software project similarity measure and a new adaptation technique based on Fuzzy numbers in order to support analogy-based estimation <b>at</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> of software development lifecycle. Method: Empirical evaluation with Jack-knifing procedure carried out, using five benchmark data sets of software projects, namely, ISBSG, Desharnais, Kemerer, Albrecht and COCOMO, are reported. The results are compared to those obtained by methods employed in the literature using case-based reasoning and stepwise regression. Results: In all data sets the empirical evaluations have shown that the proposed similarity measure and adaptation techniques method were able to remarkably improve the performance of analogy-based estimation <b>at</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> of software development. The results have also shown the proposed method outperforms some well know estimation techniques such as case-based reasoning and stepwise regression. Conclusions: It is concluded that the proposed estimation model could form a useful approach for <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> estimation especially when data is almost uncertain...|$|R

2500|$|Aspects of Islamic law {{have been}} {{proposed}} as an argument for the divergence for the Muslim world. Economist Timur Kuran argues that Islamic institutions which had <b>at</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>stages</b> promoted development later started preventing more advanced development by hampering formation of corporations, capital accumulation, mass production, and impersonal transactions. Other similar arguments proposed include the gradual prohibition of independent religious judgements (Ijtihad) and a strong communalism which limited contacts with outside groups {{and the development of}} institutions dealing with more temporary interactions of various kinds, according to Kuran. According to historian Donald Quataert, however, the Ottoman Middle East's manufacturing sector was highly productive and evolving in the 19th century. Quataert criticizes arguments rooted in Orientalism, such as [...] "now-discredited stereotypes concerning the inferiority of Islam", economic institutions having stopped evolving after the Islamic Golden Age, and decline of Ijtihad in religion negatively affecting economic evolution. Economic historian Paul Bairoch noted that Ottoman law promoted liberal free trade earlier than Britain and the United States, arguing that free trade had a negative economic impact on the Ottoman Empire and contributed to its deindustrialization, in contrast to the more protectionist policies of Britain and the United States in the early 19th century.|$|E

During the last few years, researchers endeavored hard to propose effective machine learning model for classification of Internet traffic applications <b>at</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> with few packets. Nevertheless, this essential problem still needs to be studied profoundly to find out effective packet number as well as effective machine learning (ML) model. In this paper, we tried to solve the above-mentioned problem. For this purpose, five Internet traffic datasets are utilized. Initially, we extract packet size of 20 packets and then mutual information analysis is carried out to find out the mutual information of each packet on n flow type. Thereafter, we execute 10 well-known machine learning algorithms using crossover classification method. Two statistical analysis tests, Friedman and Wilcoxon pairwise tests, are applied for the experimental results. Moreover, we also apply the statistical tests for classifiers to find out effective ML classifier. Our experimental results show that 13 – 19 packets are the effective packet numbers for 5 G IM WeChat application <b>at</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> network traffic classification.
