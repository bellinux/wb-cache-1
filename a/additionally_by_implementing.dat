40|$|The {{following}} study {{investigates the}} building and maintaining of sustainable relationships between different on-campus department and entities through the collaborative efforts and execution of PR Day. The event was both an awareness and educational campaign aimed at demonstrating {{what can be done}} with public relations. The public relations concentration within the Cal Poly Journalism Department, along with the student run PR firm, Central Coast PRspectives (CCPR) are for the most part unknown on campus. The revival of PR Day was developed to raise awareness amongst students on an interdisciplinary level of what public relations is and how it’s relevant to them, regardless of their industry. <b>Additionally,</b> <b>by</b> <b>implementing</b> the two-way symmetrical communication theory (Hunt and Grunig), PR Day 2017 {{paved the way for the}} establishment of long term relationships with other departments on the Cal Poly campus...|$|E
40|$|Despite growing {{evidence}} that biofilm formation on plastic debris {{in the marine}} environment may be essential for its biodegradation, the underlying processes {{have yet to be}} fully understood. Thus, far, bacterial biofilm formation had only been studied after short-term exposure or on floating plastic, yet a prominent share of plastic litter accumulates on the seafloor. In this study, we explored the taxonomic composition of bacterial and fungal communities on polyethylene plastic sheets and dolly ropes during long-term exposure on the seafloor, both at a harbor and an offshore location in the Belgian part of the North Sea. We reconstructed the sequence of events during biofilm formation on plastic in the harbor environment and identified a core bacteriome and subsets of bacterial indicator species for early, intermediate, and late stages of biofilm formation. <b>Additionally,</b> <b>by</b> <b>implementing</b> ITS 2 metabarcoding on plastic debris, we identified and characterized for the first time fungal genera on plastic debris. Surprisingly, none of the plastics exposed to offshore conditions displayed the typical signature of a late stage biofilm, suggesting that biofilm formation is severely hampered in the natural environment where most plastic debris accumulates...|$|E
40|$|Microthrust engines (µN-mN) {{with high}} {{specific}} impulse and long lifetime that allow for precision attitude and orbit control are a prerequisite for planned and future missions for geodetic purposes or astronomic science [1]. The potential of laserablative microthrusters for meeting these demands is being investigated at the Institute of Technical Physics [2, 3]. The concept is based on layer-by-layer removal of {{a thin layer of}} material by focusing short laser pulses on a metal surface creating plasma or vapor (laser ablation) [4]. The recoil of the ablated material leads to momentum transfer to the target, which results in sub-µN to mN thrust levels for high repetition rate laser sources [5]. <b>Additionally,</b> <b>by</b> <b>implementing</b> electro-optic beam steering, moving parts that can be a significant disturbing factor for precise thrusters can be avoided in this concept. A thrust balance based on a torsional pendulum has been constructed for measurements in vacuum. Sub-µN thrust levels have been measured in tests with a calibrated voice coil. In addition modification of the sample surface after ablation is determined by using a white light interferometry profiler. Moreover, divergence and velocity distribution of ions in the ablation plume are investigated by Faraday cup measurements. These diagnostics provide information on the influence of laser, surface and material parameters which are important figures of merit for the evaluation and optimization of laser ablative microthrusters...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{implementation}} of components and systems of building automation, in particular for HVAC systems and renewables, opens {{the possibility to}} increase the energy efficiency of (clusters of) buildings even further than originally intended. <b>By</b> <b>additionally</b> <b>implementing</b> different control strategies, {{it is possible to}} use the thermal storage capacity of buildings to improve their electrical characteristic in order to better {{meet the needs of the}} electricity grid. However, it is usually hard to obtain the thermal storage parameters of a building, because they need to be computed in complex thermal simulations. In this paper we present a way to quickly estimate an approximation thereof and feed it to strategies of different complexity, dependent on the free resources of the building automation installation.

At that time, although the scientific basis of plague was unknown, the Venetians recognized its infectious nature and successfully decreased its spread <b>by</b> <b>implementing</b> an information network. <b>Additionally,</b> <b>by</b> activating a system of inspection that involved establishing garrisons along the coasts, the Venetians were able to control all local movements in plague-infested areas, which were immediately isolated.

40|$|AbstractThe first {{electric}} power station in Greece {{is a registered}} monument of the international industrial heritage. The building consists of three longitudinal parts with a total area of 4800 m 2 approximately in plan and has two levels of a height of 3 m and 12 m respectively. The structural system consists mainly of stone masonry walls and a steel roof. Nowadays the building {{is scheduled to be}} reused as a Museum of Electric Power and the need for structural upgrade arose mainly from current seismic requirements. According to the structural assessment study, the prevailing problem of the building is the combination of the presence of very high walls, interrupted by transverse walls at a distance of approximately 80 m, and the complete lack of horizontal diaphragms. The building’s architectural, historic and technological value is significant and its preservation, by minimization of interventions, posed several problems to the retrofit design. New steel frames connected to and cooperating with the masonry walls were designed to bear the vertical roof loads and restore the horizontal diaphragm at the roof level, while also reducing the seismic actions at the walls. The total required strength was achieved <b>by</b> <b>additionally</b> <b>implementing</b> vertical post-tensioning bars and FRP strips...|$|R

In addition to the experimental work, analytical calculations are undertaken to assess the future laser thruster characteristics. Furthermore, the variation of laser parameters and target material is investigated using a hydrodynamic simulation tool for laser ablation, which is to be supplemented by molecular dynamics simulations as well as by Direct Simulation Monte Carlo-Particle in Cell (DSMC-PIC) calculations in cooperation with the University of Stuttgart...|$|E

40|$|Tourism is {{characterized}} by seasonal patterns that provoke substantial implications on tourism development. This paper quantifies the seasonality of tourism demand in selected {{countries in the region}} by computing several indicators for measuring dispersion and concentration in tourism. The calculations are done with monthly series of total number of tourists for the period 2007 - 2013. The results vary in regional frames, from low seasonality with no substantial meaning for tourism development, to high seasonality and considerable concentration of tourism demand. Although the study found certain similarities in tourism flow distribution and concentration, yet the detected differences in the levels of seasonality effects within the region, point to conclusion of applying different tourism policies at national level. Hence, the paper underlines a justification to develop diversified tourism product <b>by</b> <b>implementing</b> different tourism strategies. <b>Additionally,</b> <b>by</b> understanding the process of seasonality, the key-tourism players are {{in a better position to}} develop plans and strategies to assist potential tourists negotiate through the constraint process thereby influencing the aggregate patterns of seasonality...|$|R
