5|$|During Shadow of the Colossus, {{the player}} {{receives}} little {{information concerning the}} backstories of the characters and their relationships with one another. The game {{takes place in a}} fantasy setting, with most of the game's events occurring within <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> <b>and</b> unpopulated peninsula, known as the Forbidden Land, separated from the outside world by a mountain range to its north and sea to the south and east. The presence of ruins and other ancient structures indicate the area was once a settlement.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania regained its {{independence}} on February 16, 1918 {{and the old}} fortress was placed under engineering staff supervision. Those materials {{that had not been}} taken by the Germans were used to resupply Lithuanian military needs, and for the construction of the armored train Gediminas, named after the 14th century Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas. In 1920, the Kaunas Fortress Board was formed and charged with the task of administering the fortress. Due to the development of new military technologies, its reconstruction was seen as <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> <b>and</b> inappropriate expense. The fortress' armament was dismantled and the trenches were filled with scrap iron.|$|E

5|$|According to Aonuma, the team's {{starting}} point for development was the Wii version of Twilight Princess: feeling they had not fully realized their goal of creating <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> <b>and</b> realistic world with Twilight Princess, they used their previous work {{as a foundation for}} the next title. They also sought to create a memorable experience equivalent to , by that time considered the series' most memorable title. Development lasted around five years, and according to series producer Shigeru Miyamoto, the game's budget was considered quite high for a Nintendo project. The development time was initially estimated at three years, but difficulties and changes in the game's development extended development time by a further two years: despite this, Miyamoto felt that this was not wasted development time as the first two years went into experimentation. By June 2011, the game was complete aside from fine tuning and balancing its mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Ashmole met the {{botanist}} and collector John Tradescant {{the younger}} around 1650. Tradescant had, with his father, built up <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> <b>and</b> renowned collection of exotic plants, mineral specimens and other curiosities {{from around the}} world at their house in Lambeth. Ashmole helped Tradescant catalogue his collection in 1652, and, in 1656, he financed the publication of the catalogue, the Musaeum Tradescantianum. In 1659, Tradescant, who had lost his only son seven years earlier, legally deeded his collection to Ashmole. Under the agreement, Ashmole would take possession at Tradescant's death. When Tradescant died in 1662, his widow, Hester, contested the deed, claiming her husband had signed it when drunk without knowing its contents, but the matter was settled in Chancery in Ashmole's favour two years later. Hester was to hold the collection in trust for Ashmole until her death. Ashmole's determined aggressiveness in obtaining the Tradescant collection for himself has led some scholars to consider that Ashmole was an ambitious, ingratiating social climber who stole a hero's legacy for his own glorification.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the kingdom}} was {{largely based on}} agriculture, the {{construction}} of irrigation works was a major achievement of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, ensuring water supply in the dry zone and helping the country grow mostly self-sufficient. Several kings, most notably Vasabha and Mahasena, built large reservoirs and canals, which created <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> <b>and</b> complex irrigation network in the Rajarata area throughout the Anuradhapura period. These constructions are {{an indication of the}} advanced technical and engineering skills used to create them. The famous paintings and structures at Sigiriya; the Ruwanwelisaya, Jetavana stupas, and other large stupas; large buildings like the Lovamahapaya; and religious works (like the numerous Buddha statues) are landmarks demonstrating the Anuradhapura period's advancement in sculpting.|$|E

Athens is a war-torn city under assault by Ares, the God of War; beyond the city is the Desert of Lost Souls, <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> <b>and</b> windy desert of ancient ruins. The majority of the game occurs in Pandora’s Temple, which is chained {{to the back of}} the Titan Cronos, who crawls through the desert. The massive temple, constructed by the architect Pathos Verdes III, is filled with traps and monsters, and has three sections dedicated to the Titan Atlas and gods Poseidon and Hades, respectively. The Underworld is a fiery realm with spiked pillars full of souls and flaming versions of previously encountered enemies. Athens is the scene of the final battle before a denouement on Mount Olympus in the God of War's throne room.|$|E
5|$|The debate {{continues}} over why Peribsen {{chose this}} name. Earlier theories have favoured {{the idea that}} Egypt was split in two realms during Peribsen's time or {{that he was a}} heretic, who sought to start a new monotheistic religion with Seth as the only worshipped god. However, newer evidence and evaluations tend to show that the Egyptian kingdom was unified, but witnessed <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> <b>and</b> profound reform during the second dynasty. Seal impressions from tombs of this era reveal great changes in the titles held by high officials, pointing to a reduction of their power. Further seal impressions show that several deities were worshipped under Peribsen, refuting the monotheism theory, with other contemporary inscriptions indicating that the Egyptian grammar was perfected during his reign: In particular, the earliest seal impressions with complete sentences date back to Peribsen's reign. Thus, Peribsen's reign was in fact a time of cultural and religious advancement.|$|E

In terms of access to education, China's system represented a pyramid; because of the scarcity of resources allotted to higher education, student numbers decreased sharply at the higher levels. Although there were dramatic advances in primary education after 1949, achievements in secondary and higher education were not as great.|$|E
25|$|The 19th-century {{discoveries of}} <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> <b>and</b> {{previously}} unexpected extinct Paleogene fauna of North America, as interpreted by paleontologists Joseph Leidy, Edward Drinker Cope, and Othniel Charles Marsh, aided {{understanding of the}} early history of this family. Llamas were not always confined to South America; abundant llama-like remains were found in Pleistocene deposits in the Rocky Mountains and in Central America. Some of the fossil llamas were much larger than current forms. Some species remained in North America during the last ice ages. North American llamas are categorized as a single extinct genus, Hemiauchenia. Llama-like animals would have been a common sight 25,000 years ago, in modern-day California, Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Missouri, and Florida.|$|E
