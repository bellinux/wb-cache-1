25|$|The {{recorded}} {{data shows}} that the No. 1 engine reached a minimum torque level of −9% in Beta range, while No. 2 engine reached a minimum of 0%. This thrust asymmetry was coincident with the aircraft commencing a roll to the left (maximum recorded value of 40 degrees bank). It {{is possible that the}} PF may have made a control wheel input to the right in response to the unanticipated left roll. However, without FDR parameters of control wheel or control surface position the Investigation could not determine if such an input was made. The subsequent <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> to commence the go-around, at approximately 100 feet, coincided with the commencement of a rapid roll to the right and loss of control. The roll continued through the vertical, the right wingtip struck the runway and the aircraft inverted.|$|E

2500|$|It takes {{a couple}} of weeks of regular use to become {{accustomed}} to the unusual feel of the Rotor linkage cranksets. [...] After becoming accustomed to it, most riders prefer it. [...] However, there is no difficulty in switching between ordinary cranksets and Rotor linkage cranksets. [...] Once a rider has learned to use Rotor linkage cranksets the adaption when switching back and forth between crankset types only takes a minute or two. [...] Many competitive cyclists, including the Cervélo TestTeam, use Rotor's Q-rings which mimic the fluctuation in gear size without the added weight. However Rotor Q-rings and other non-round rings cannot duplicate the crank arm movements that allow <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> through the dead spots of the pedaling cycle. [...] Non-round rings also increase the difficulty of setting up the front derailleur, while Rotor linkage cranksets present no extra difficulty in that regard.|$|E

The most beautiful actions of the human body, and the highest results of the human intelligence, are conditions, or achievements, of quite unlaborious,--nay, of recreative,--effort. But labour is the suffering in effort. It is the negative quantity, or quantity of de-feat, which has to be counted against every Feat, and of de-fect which has to be counted against every Fact, or Deed of men. In brief, it is [...] "that quantity of our toil which we die in." ...|$|E
