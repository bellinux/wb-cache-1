5|$|Paid {{additional}} content was released alongside the games, {{in the form}} of extra levels used to improve the units' strength or gather exclusive resources. A series of additional storylines were also released to expand on the main narrative. The first is Before <b>Awakening,</b> in which the Avatar is transported to Ylisse, the setting of Fire Emblem <b>Awakening,</b> and aids its heroes Chrom, Frederick, and Lissa in fighting off the forces of Valla. The second, Hidden Truths, centers around <b>Awakening</b> characters Owain, Inigo, and Severa as they are contacted by a mysterious figure who asks for their help in saving Valla. To this end, they are given new powers and names: Odin, Laslow, and Selena. The trio ultimately join with the kingdom of Nohr as retainers.|$|E

5|$|After the {{critical}} and commercial success of <b>Awakening,</b> development began on Fates, {{with the staff}} of <b>Awakening</b> returning to their previous roles. The team's main concern was adding new features and refinements to the original gameplay, and improving the story, which had received criticism from fans. To this end, writer Shin Kibayashi was brought in. To show {{all sides of the}} story and provide players with different Fire Emblem experiences, the game was split up into multiple versions. Upon release, it met with highly positive reviews: Birthright was generally seen as a good starting place for new players, Conquest was praised for its challenge, while Revelation was noted as a good middle ground between the two releases.|$|E

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the development of <b>awakenings</b> during preterm and term age in 12 low-risk infants observed between 33 and 40 weeks of post-conceptional age. Waking was been detected through the analysis of body motility. Gross generalized body movements with prolonged startles, marked stretching and writhing was considered as waking, whereas vigorous, forceful abrupt body movements with high frequency tremor sometimes superimposed upon movements were considered as corresponding to crying. Total number of <b>awakenings</b> in the 24 h does not show significant changes with age, whereas the mean duration increases significantly, which is accounted for mainly by those <b>awakenings</b> starting with crying, in particular, during the day. These data suggest a developmental gap between the ability to sustain the waking state, which already starts to increase before term age, {{and the ability to}} maintain prolonged sleep episodes, which has been shown to develop later. Furthermore, the developmental difference between <b>awakenings</b> starting with crying and <b>awakenings</b> starting with wakefulness suggests that two kinds of <b>awakenings</b> might be modulated by different factors...|$|R
5|$|Another major {{stimulus}} for growth was the Second Great <b>Awakening</b> (c. 1790 – 1840), which initially {{grew out of}} a 1787 student revival at Hampden–Sydney College, a Presbyterian institution in Virginia. From there, revivals spread to Presbyterian churches in Virginia and then to North Carolina and Kentucky. The Revival of 1800 was one such revival that first grew out of meetings led by Presbyterian minister James McGready. The most famous camp meeting of the Second Great <b>Awakening,</b> the Cane Ridge Revival in Kentucky, occurred during a traditional Scottish communion season under the leadership of local Presbyterian minister Barton W. Stone. Over 10 thousand people came to Cane Ridge to hear sermons from Presbyterian as well as Methodist and Baptist preachers.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Sleep {{disturbances}} {{are important}} features of {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD); however, the published data characterizing PTSD sleep phenomena are limited. The authors report on the phenomenology and physiological correlates ofsymptomatic sleep events in PTSD. Method: The study data included survey results that addressed sleep symptoms during the past month in combat veterans with and without PTSD (N-_ 58), sleep diary records of <b>awakenings</b> from combat veterans with PTSD hospitalized on an inpatient rehabilitation unit (N= 52), and overnight polysomnography recordings obtained from 2 1 medication-free combat veterans with PTSD and eight healthy comparison subjects not exposed to combat. Results: Recurrent <b>awakenings,</b> threatening dreams, thrashing movements during sleep, and <b>awakenings</b> with startle or panic features represented the most prevalently reported sleep-re-lated symptoms. Laboratory findings of longer time awake, micro-awakenings, and a trend for patients to exhibit body and limb movements during sleep {{are consistent with the}} subjec-tively reported symptom profile. Prospectively assessed symptomatic <b>awakenings</b> featured startle or panic symptoms or anxiety related to threatening dreams.

5|$|The {{previous}} {{title in}} the series, Fire Emblem <b>Awakening,</b> was planned {{to be the last}} in the series due to decreasing sales. The game was a worldwide commercial success, prompting Nintendo to greenlight a new entry. Fates was co-developed by regular Fire Emblem developer Intelligent Systems and Nintendo SPD, with the main staff of <b>Awakening</b> returning to their respective roles for Fates: they were Intelligence System's Kouhei Maeda as director, Nintendo SPD director Genki Yokota, Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami, art director Toshiyuki Kusakihara, and character designer Yūsuke Kozaki. Yokota's work on the game ran parallel with his work on Xenoblade Chronicles X. Masahiro Higuchi, Awakenings project manager, came on board as a producer. According to the original staff, the request for a sequel was a shock as they had all developed <b>Awakening</b> assuming it would be the last in the series. During its early design stages, Fates was given the working title Fire Emblem 3DS II. The game's cutscenes were animated by Studio Anima, while storyboarding was handled by Spooky Graphic. To develop the multiple versions, one core team worked on the game's shared assets, while additional teams handled individual level design.|$|E

40|$|Margaret Moline, 1 Marco daCosta DiBonaventura, 2 Dhvani Shah, 1 Rami Ben-Joseph 1 1 Purdue Pharma, LP, Stamford, CT, USA; 2 Health Outcomes Practice, Kantar Health, New York, NY, USA Study objectives: Middle-of-the-night (MOTN) <b>awakenings</b> with {{difficulty}} returning to sleep {{are among the}} most common symptoms of insomnia. Despite the epidemiological studies that have been conducted, {{there is a lack of}} data on the impact of MOTN <b>awakenings</b> on health status and socioeconomic indicators in comparison with other insomnia symptoms. Methods: Data were analyzed from the 2011 US National Health and Wellness Survey (adults ≥ 18 years old; N= 60, 783), which asked respondents whether they had experienced specific symptoms of insomnia (ie, MOTN <b>awakenings,</b> difficulty falling asleep, waking several times, waking up too early, or poor quality of sleep). Respondents who reported only one insomnia symptom were compared among insomnia subgroups and with no insomnia symptom controls with respect to demographics, health history, and health outcomes (Short Form- 12 v 2, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire, and costs). Additional analyses compared respondents with only MOTN <b>awakenings</b> and matched controls on health outcomes. Results: MOTN <b>awakenings</b> without other insomnia symptoms were reported by 3. 5 % of respondents. Poor quality of sleep was associated with the strongest effects on health status compared with other insomnia symptoms even after adjusting for demographic and health characteristics differences. Differences across insomnia symptoms with respect to cost-related outcomes were generally modest, though all were higher (if not significantly so) than respondents without insomnia. Respondents who experienced only waking several times and only MOTN <b>awakenings</b> had the highest direct costs, while respondents who experienced only poor quality of sleep and only difficulty falling asleep had the highest indirect costs. Respondents with only MOTN <b>awakenings</b> reported significantly worse mental and physical health status and worse health utilities relative to insomnia-free matched controls (all P< 0. 05). Annual per-employee indirect costs were also significantly higher ($ 4, 328 vs $ 3, 000; P< 0. 05). Among only MOTN <b>awakenings</b> respondents, 74. 6 % were considered only symptomatic (ie, they did not report having insomnia or having been diagnosed with insomnia). Conclusion: These findings collectively highlight the prevalence and socioeconomic impact of specific types of insomnia symptoms, including MOTN <b>awakenings,</b> experienced by adults in the US.

40|$|Objectives. To {{study the}} {{relationship}} between nocturnal periodic breathing episodes and behavioral <b>awakenings</b> at high altitude. Methods. Observational study. It is 6 -day ascent of 4 healthy subjects from Besisahar (760 meters) to Manang (3540 meters) in Nepal in March 2012. A recording pulse oximeter was worn by each subject to measure their oxygen saturation {{and the presence of}} periodic breathing continuously through the night. An actigraph was simultaneously worn in order to determine nocturnal behavioral <b>awakenings.</b> There were no interventions. Results. 187 -hour sleep at high altitude was analyzed, and of this, 145 hours (78 %) had at least one PB event. At high altitude, 10. 5 % (95 % CI 6. 5 - 14. 6 %) of total sleep time was spent in PB while 15 out of 50 <b>awakenings</b> (30 %, 95 % CI: 18 - 45 %) occurring at high altitudes were associated with PB (P < 0. 001). Conclusions. Our data reveals a higher than expected number of behavioral <b>awakenings</b> associated with PB compared to what would be expected by chance. This suggests that PB likely plays a role in behavioral <b>awakenings</b> at high altitude...|$|R
