At that point, Giáp {{decided to change}} tactics. Although Giáp still had the same objective — to overrun French defenses east of the river — he decided to employ entrenchment and sapping to try to achieve it.|$|E
5|$|His last novel, Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende (Tales of <b>a</b> <b>Long</b> <b>Night),</b> was {{published}} in 1956, and was favorably received. Döblin's remaining years were marked by poor health (he had Parkinson's disease) and lengthy stays in multiple clinics and hospitals, including his alma mater, Freiburg University. Through the intervention of Theodor Heuss and Joachim Tiburtius, {{he was able to}} receive more money from the Berlin office in charge of compensating victims of Nazi persecution; this, and a literary prize from the Mainz Academy in the sum of 10,000 DM helped finance his growing medical expenses.|$|E
5|$|Venables brought Gary Lineker {{back from}} Barcelona, and Stewart was {{selected}} to be Lineker's striker partner for the 1989–90 season, leaving Walsh on the bench. An injury to Stewart gave Walsh the chance to win back his first team place, and he marked {{his return to the}} first team with the winning goal in a 2–1 victory over rivals Arsenal, though failed to capitalise on this performance and again was dropped. Later in the season he had to be taken off at half-time against Wimbledon as he had <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>night</b> of drinking with George Best the previous night. He ended the campaign with three goals from 13 starts and 18 substitute appearances.|$|E

They rename the bar and try to continue running it but get no business and {{have to find a}} way to market their unwelcoming business. Homer gets help from Moe Szyslak, who suggests that they allow people to do illegal things in their pub. They find out that smoking is now banned from Irish pubs and Moe urges the Simpsons to turn it into a smokeasy. They do a roaring trade, but are closed down by the Irish authorities. As a punishment, Homer and Grampa are deported back to America and have to pay a small fine. Chief Wiggum arrives to bring them back to the U.S., but accidentally hits himself with his nightstick and then Maces and Tasers himself.|$|E
5|$|Bruno Alfred Döblin (10 August 1878 – 26 June 1957) was a German novelist, essayist, and doctor, {{best known}} for his novel Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929). A {{prolific}} writer whose œuvre spans {{more than half a century}} and a wide variety of literary movements and styles, Döblin is one of the most important figures of German literary modernism. His complete works comprise over a dozen novels ranging in genre from historical novels to science fiction to novels about the modern metropolis; several dramas, radio plays, and screenplays; a true crime story; a travel account; two book-length philosophical treatises; scores of essays on politics, religion, art, and society; and numerous letters—his complete works, republished by Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag and Fischer Verlag, span more than thirty volumes. His first published novel, Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lung (The Three Leaps of Wang Lun), appeared in 1915 and his final novel, Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende (Tales of <b>a</b> <b>Long</b> <b>Night)</b> was published in 1956, one year before his death.|$|E
5|$|Two and a {{half weeks}} later, on the evening of 8 January 1917 the mounted units of the Desert Column {{commanded}} by Chetwode rode out of El Arish towards Rafa where a 2,000-strong Turkish garrison was based. The attacking force comprised the Australian 1st Light Horse Brigade, 3rd Light Horse Brigade and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade of the Anzac Mounted Division under the command of Chauvel, the 5th Mounted Brigade and three battalions of the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade. After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>night</b> march, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force attacked the strongly entrenched position at El Magruntein. A fierce day-long battle resulted in the mounted troops (fighting dismounted) capturing the town around nightfall with the loss of 71 killed and 415 wounded. The Turkish garrison suffered heavily, with 200 killed and another 1,600 taken prisoner.|$|E

25|$|In {{application}} of Archduke Charles's {{plan to take}} the enemy in a double envelopment, Feldmarshalleutnant Klenau, commanding VI Korps, and Feldzeugmeister Kollowrat, commanding III Korps, moved forward towards the French left.

25|$|Relations between Huerta and Madero grew {{strained}} {{during the}} course of this campaign when Pancho Villa, the commander of the División del Norte, refused orders from General Huerta. Huerta ordered Villa's execution, but Madero commuted the sentence and Villa was sent to the same Santiago Tlatelolco prison as Reyes from which he escaped on Christmas Day 1912. Angry at Madero's commutation of Villa's sentence, Huerta, after <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>night</b> of drinking, mused about reaching an agreement with Orozco and together deposing Madero as president. When Mexico's Minister of War learned of General Huerta's comments, he stripped Huerta of his command, but Madero intervened and restored Huerta to command.|$|E
25|$|Meade's orders had {{stated that}} the {{reconnaissance}} in force by four of his corps would be started by 7 a.m. on July 14, but by this time signs were clear that the enemy had withdrawn. Advancing skirmishers found that the entrenchments were empty. Meade ordered a general pursuit of the Confederates at 8:30a.m., but very little contact could be made at this late hour. Cavalry under Buford and Kilpatrick attacked the rearguard of Lee's army, Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division, which was still on a ridge about {{a mile and a}} half from Falling Waters. The initial attack caught the Confederates by surprise after <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>night</b> with little sleep, and hand-to-hand fighting ensued. Kilpatrick attacked again and Buford struck them in their right and rear. Heth's and Pender's divisions lost as many as 2,000 men as prisoners. Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew, who had survived Pickett's Charge with a minor hand wound, was mortally wounded at Falling Waters.|$|E

500|$|His third son, Gregory Hancock Hemingway, {{was born}} a year later on November 12, 1931, in Kansas City. Pauline's uncle bought the couple a house in Key West with a {{carriage}} house, {{the second floor of}} which was converted into a writing studio. [...] Its location {{across the street from the}} lighthouse made it easy for Hemingway to find after <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>night</b> of drinking. While in Key West, Hemingway frequented the local bar Sloppy Joe's. He invited friends—including Waldo Peirce, Dos Passos, and Max Perkins—to join him on fishing trips and on an all-male expedition to the Dry Tortugas. Meanwhile, he continued to travel to Europe and to Cuba, and—although in 1933 he wrote of Key West, [...] "We have a fine house here, and kids are all well"—Mellow believes he [...] "was plainly restless".|$|E
500|$|Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende (Tales of <b>a</b> <b>Long</b> <b>Night)</b> (1956) was Döblin's last novel. [...] Set in England {{immediately}} after the Second World War, the novel narrates the story of Edward Allison, an English soldier who had been badly wounded during the war. Back among his family, Edward must deal with his war trauma, long buried family conflicts, and his destabilized sense of self. The novel treats such themes as {{the search for the}} self, guilt and responsibility, the struggle between the sexes, war and violence, and religion, among others. Döblin wrote the novel between August 1945 and October 1946, although it was not published until a decade later. Upon its 1956 release by the East Berlin publishing house Rütten & Loening, the novel was well received. The reference to Hamlet in the German title was likely motivated by Döblin's reading of Sigmund Freud's interpretation of Shakespeare's Hamlet.|$|E
500|$|Modern, well-edited, {{critical}} {{volumes of}} almost the complete œuvre have been appearing in German since the 1980s, published by Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag and, since 2008, by the Fischer Verlag; and the Internationale Alfred-Döblin Kolloquien {{have been held}} every two years since the early 1980s. [...] But {{only a handful of}} other works of fiction have ever appeared in English translations: The Three Leaps of Wang Lun (trans. C. D. Godwin, Chinese University Press, Hong Kong, 1991), and the November 1918 trilogy: A People Betrayed (which also includes The Troops Return) and Karl and Rosa (trans. John E.

Trevor and Phyllis Blewitt, Howard Fertig, 1976). Two works of autobiography have also been translated: Destiny's Journey (trans. Edna McCown, Paragon House, 1992), the harrowing account of Döblin's flight and exile in the 1940s; and the account of his mid-1920s Journey to Poland (trans J. Neugroschel, I. B. Tauris, 1991).|$|E

500|$|On {{arrival at}} Cardiff Central railway station, Friday {{was arrested by}} the British Transport Police for having {{travelled}} from Reading with only a platform ticket. Andrews bailed his new player out of police custody {{and took him to}} Ninian Park to sign the contract.

After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>night</b> of drinking the night before his Cardiff debut, Friday lined up against Fulham on 1 January 1977. The Fulham defence included former England captain Bobby Moore, but Friday marked his first match for the Welsh club with two goals; he also squeezed Moore's testicles during the game as Cardiff won 3–0. Andrews was so happy with Friday's performance that he phoned Hurley two days later, on Monday morning. [...] "Oh, Charlie", Andrews gushed, [...] "he was magnificent. He tore them inside out. ... Moore was chasing him all over the place". The Cardiff manager continued to heap praise on his new acquisition until Hurley finally stopped him. [...] "Jimmy, you've only had him four days", he warned, sombrely: [...] "Give it a few months"...|$|E
500|$|Produced by Cool & Dre, {{the song}} was {{recorded}} at Allido Sound Studios in New York, by Derek Pacuk, while the mixing was done by Serban Ghanea.

He had traveled to the New York recording studio from Washington D.C. after <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>night</b> of partying. Gaga {{was already in the}} studio in her exuberant style with a big ribbon atop her head by which Wale was taken aback, and was a [...] "cultural difference" [...] for him. In an effort to warm up to each other they made small talk about their respective record deals with Interscope. By the end of the session, Gaga had created five different hooks for [...] "Chillin" [...] and added her vocals on the track. The rapper added, [...] "It took a while. Once we finally got the ball rolling, it was almost time to go. It was natural though. It's wack when you get in the studio with somebody and it's automatically music time— it feels fake. We were trying to feel each other out." [...] Wale later added {{that he would like to}} collaborate with Gaga again on a track but it was unknown to him if Gaga would be interested.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Friday the 13th {{was produced}} {{and directed by}} Sean S. Cunningham, who had previously worked with filmmaker Wes Craven on The Last House on the Left (1972). Cunningham, inspired {{by the success of}} John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), wanted Friday the 13th to be shocking, visually stunning, and [...] " [...] you jump out of your seat". Distancing himself from The Last House on the Left, Cunningham wanted Friday the 13th {{to be more of a}} [...] "roller coaster ride". The first film was meant to be [...] "a real scary movie", and at the same time make audiences laugh. The concept for Friday the 13th began as nothing more than a title. <b>A</b> <b>Long</b> <b>Night</b> at Camp Blood was the working title Victor Miller used while he drafted a script, but Cunningham believed in his [...] "Friday the 13th" [...] moniker and rushed to place an advertisement in International Variety. Worrying that someone else owned the rights to the title and wanting to avoid potential lawsuits, Cunningham thought it would be best to find out immediately. Cunningham commissioned a New York advertising agency to develop his visual concept of the Friday the 13th logo, which consisted of big block letters bursting through a pane of glass. In the end, Cunningham believed there were [...] "no problems" [...] with the title, but distributor George Mansour contends that there was an issue: [...] "There was a movie before ours called Friday the 13th: The Orphan. Moderately successful. But someone still threatened to sue. I don't know whether Phil [...] paid them off, but it was finally resolved." ...|$|E
