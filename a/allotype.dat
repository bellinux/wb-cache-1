5|$|Abantiades latipennis {{is one of}} {{fourteen}} species currently identified within the genus Abantiades, {{all of which are}} found exclusively in Australia. The species was first described in 1932 by Norman Tindale, an Australian entomologist and anthropologist. Tindale described the species, under its current name, but provided no etymology for the specific epithet latipennis. He based the species description on specimens from Lorne (including the holotype male and <b>allotype</b> female), Pomonal and Mount Mistake (in the Langi Ghiran State Park), Victoria, and from Zeehan, Eaglehawk Neck and Launceston, Tasmania.|$|E

40|$|Antisera to rabbit leukocytes (1) or to rabbit {{immunoglobulins}} (2 - 5) may stimulate {{cultures of}} rabbit peripheral lymphocytes. Such antisera stimulate lymphocytes in vitro to synthesize RNA, DNA, and protein, to transform into immature "blast" cells, and to undergo division (2). Allogeneic (rabbit) antisera to genetically controlled intraspecies antigenic determinants present on rabbit immunogiobulins (<b>allotypes)</b> (6 [...] 8) will also stimulate blast transformation of rabbit peripheral lymphocytes in vitro when the lymphocytes are obtained from an allotypically appropriate donor (9, 10).

40|$|Rabbit {{immunoglobulins}} bear six {{well defined}} genetically controlled antigenic determinants termed <b>allotypes</b> (1). Three of these <b>allotypes,</b> Aal, Aa 2, and Aa 3, {{are located on}} the H chain of rabbit IgG, and the other three, Ab 4, Ab 5, and Ab 6, are found on the L chain (2, 3). Specific antisera produced in rabbits to all six of these <b>allotypes</b> may stimulate blast transformation and DNA synthesis when added to in vitro cultures of lymphocytes obtained from a donor of the appropriate allotypic specificity (4, 5). The specificity of this transformation appears {{to be due to}} the genetic identity of the lymphocyte and is not conferred upon lymphocytes by environmental immunoglobulins (4, 6). The addition of two antisera to different <b>allotypes</b> located on the same IgG chain or to <b>allotypes</b> located on different IgG chains induces a summation of lymphoblast transformation and DNA synthesis. One interpretation of these results was that lymphocytes of the peripheral blood may be primed to produce only {{one or the other of}} the two polypeptide chains of IgG, but not both (5). Xenogeneic antisera to rabbit IgG are also capable of inducing blast transformation and DNA synthesis in rabbit lymphocyte cultures (4, 7). In orde...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Polymorphism among class I {{molecules}} {{of the major}} histocompatibility complex (MHC) confers allotypic specificity on the peptides that these molecules bind and present to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Evolution of new human HLA class I alleles usually involves gene recombination events that replace a segment of one allele with the homologous region of another. In this study, {{the impact of these}} evolutionary changes has been assessed by comparison of the peptide-binding specificities of six related HLA-B <b>allotypes.</b> Results Endogenous peptides bound by HLA-B∗ 5401, HLA-B∗ 5501, HLA-B∗ 5502, HLA-B∗ 5601, HLA-B∗ 6701 and HLA-B∗ 0702 were characterized. Despite differing by 1 – 9 of the amino-acid residues comprising their peptide-binding sites, all these <b>allotypes</b> share a dominant preference for peptides that have proline at position 2. Polymorphism results in differing selection of carboxy-terminal and secondary anchor residues, but the peptide-binding specificities are sufficiently similar that there is overlap in the repertoires of peptides bound by these <b>allotypes.</b> Complete sequence determination of individual peptides revealed four that could be isolated from two or more <b>allotypes.</b> Members of the closely related HLA-B 22 family — HLA-B∗ 5401, HLA-B∗ 5501, HLA-B∗ 5502 and HLA-B∗ 5601 — show only minor differences in their peptide-binding specificities. This marked similarity is reflected at the functional level, as alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes generated against HLA-B∗ 5401 and HLA-B∗ 5501 exhibited cross-reactive recognition. Conclusion The isolation of identical endogenously bound peptides from six HLA-B <b>allotypes</b> demonstrates overlap in the repertoires of peptides bound in vivo by different <b>allotypes.</b> We speculate that the shared preference for binding peptides with proline at position 2 reflects a selective pressure to retain this specificity, which may be based upon peptide availability in vivo. Characterization of the overlap between the repertoires of peptides bound by HLA-B <b>allotypes</b> could simplify the development of peptide-based vaccines that are targeted to cytotoxic T cells, as single peptides would be effective for humans of different HLA types...|$|R

40|$|Fast-evolving MHC class I {{polymorphism}} {{serves to}} diversify NK cell and CD 8 T cell responses in individuals, families, and populations. Because only {{chimpanzee and bonobo}} have strict orthologs of all HLA class I, their study gives unique perspectives on the human condition. We defined polymorphism of Papa-B, the bonobo ortholog of HLA-B, for six wild bonobo populations. Sequences for Papa-B exon 2 and 3 were determined from the genomic DNA in 255 fecal samples, minimally representing 110 individuals. Twenty-two Papa-B alleles were defined, each encoding a different Papa-B protein. No Papa-B is identical to any chimpanzee Patr-B, human HLA-B, or gorilla Gogo-B. Phylogenetic analysis identified a Glade of MHC-B, defined by residues 45 - 74 of the alpha(1) domain, which is broadly conserved among bonobo, chimpanzee, and gorilla. Bonobo populations have 3 - 14 Papa-B <b>allotypes.</b> Three Papa-B are in all populations, and they are each of a different functional type: <b>allotypes</b> having the Bw 4 epitope recognized by killer cell Ig-like receptors of NK cells, <b>allotypes</b> having the Cl epitope also recognized by killer cell Ig-like receptors, and <b>allotypes</b> having neither epitope. For population Malebo, these three Papa-B are the only Papa-B <b>allotypes.</b> Although small in number, their sequence divergence is such that the nucleotide diversity (mean proportional distance) of Papa-B in Malebo is greater than in the other populations and is also greater than expected for random combinations of three Papa-B. Overall, Papa-B has substantially less diversity than Patr-B in chimpanzee subspecies and HLA-B in indigenous human populations, consistent with bonobo having experienced narrower population bottlenecks...|$|R

IgG isotypes are in part genetically controlled, and GM/KM <b>allotypes</b> {{are believed to be}} involved in this control. Methods In this study, 216 individuals from Daraweesh, an area of seasonal malaria transmission in Sudan, were followed for nine years for malaria infection. Total IgG and IgG isotypes against four malaria antigens, MSP 2 - 3 D 7, MSP 2 -FC 27, AMA 1, and Pf 332 -C 231 were measured in plasma obtained from the cohort {{at the end of the}} study, during the dry malaria-free period. The GM/KM <b>allotypes</b> of the donors were determined. Results The GM 1, 17 5, 13, 14, 6 phenotype was associated with a higher incidence of malaria compared with the non- 1, 17 5, 13, 14, 6 phenotypes (P = 0. 037). Paradoxically, the carriers of the GM 1, 17 5, 13, 14, 6 phenotype had significantly higher baseline levels of total IgG and non-cytophilic IgG isotypes as compared to non-carriers. The KM <b>allotypes</b> influence on IgG isotypes level was limited. Finally, the differences in the baseline concentrations of total IgG and IgG isotypes between the different GK/KM phenotype carriers were antigen-dependent.
