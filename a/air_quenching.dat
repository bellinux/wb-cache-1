Slow quenching may negatively affect the mechanical properties of the cast plates when using highly quench-sensitive aluminum alloys because of its negative effect on the precipitation hardening behavior of such alloys. The effect of the quenching rate on precipitation kinetics in AA 2219 DC cast alloy was systematically studied under water and <b>air</b> <b>quenching</b> conditions using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique.

The results were interpreted on the base of potentiodynamic and impedance measurements. Findings - From the impedance spectra a reaction mechanism can be determined: after samples had reached and passed the active peak, expressed as the highestpeak on the potentiodynamic curve, corrosion products at interfaces, which were adsorbed at metal surface, led to an increase in the charge transfer resistance. Elevated temperature of immersion media has had appreciable influence on the corrosion rate and adsorption of products, but atthis temperature level did not affect the principle of corrosion reactions. Activation energies were calculated to exhibit temperature dependence of current density, which was the highest for the oil- and the lowest for the air-quenched sample.

40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} {{technique has}} been used to characterize the state of residual stress and texture in the rims of cast steel railroad wheels. Orthogonally polarized shear-horizontal (SH) waves are propagated through the thickness of the rim in pulse-echo mode. The (normalized) difference of arrival times of these waves (acoustic birefringence) depends upon both texture and stress. The birefringence, B, was measured with two transducers: an electromagnetic-acoustic transducer (EMAT) and a piezoelectric transducer made of PZT. Two wheels were tested. The first wheel had a sawcut, which locally relieved the residual (hoop) stress. Measurement of the birefringence at the sawcut allowed us to estimate the contribution of texture, which we subtracted from values of B at stressed locations. Values of hoop stress obtained with the EMAT and PZT transducer agreed to within 10 MPa, for transducers placed on the center of the back face of the rim. The second (uncut) wheel had been heat treated and <b>air</b> <b>quenched,</b> giving a different microstructure. Measurements of B were made with both transducers at different radial and circumferential locations.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 121 - 126). The {{production of}} synthetic yarns requires a cost efficient process whilst simultaneously incorporating process methods which {{ultimately lead to}} a high quality fibre. A critical part of the production process is the spinning of the molten polymer into individual filaments which are brought together to form the filament bundle. During this process a <b>quench</b> <b>air</b> stream is blown across the filament bundle to aid in cooling the molten polymer. Here, heat transfer limitations may cause inter-filament property variations, which will adversely affect the quality of the yarn. This thesis focuses on the development of a model which allows for an a priori prediction of the influence of major process variables on the degree of fibre property uniformity. Fibre quality is characterised by the high degree of uniformity in the properties which affect the structural features of the yarn. Yarn morphology is dictated by the degree of crystallinity and molecular alignment of the polymer macro-molecules parallel to the fibre axis. These properties are strongly influenced by online tensile stress and local temperature which are, in turn, affected by heat transfer effects between the <b>quench</b> <b>air</b> and filament surface. A model that predicts the influence of heat transfer limitations on the uniformity of the as-spun fibre is therefore needed. Previous research in this field is limited with most work focussed on single filament model development. In this investigation, a monofilament model developed by previous workers (Jarecki et al., 2000) is integrated into a multifilament framework. This model assumes Newtonian behaviour of the polymer with viscosity strongly dependent on local temperature and crystallinity. The development of the multifilament model involves dividing the spinning zone into a number of cells, in which the filament properties are modelled using the monofilament model. The change in <b>quench</b> <b>air</b> temperature is estimated by means of an energy balance incorporating air flow terms and heat transfer through forced convection from the filament surface. A novel iteration approach is proposed in which the temperature of the <b>quench</b> <b>air</b> exiting each cell is iterated for until convergence is met. In simplifying the model, it was found that uniform <b>quench</b> <b>air</b> flow profile could be assumed, since the quench flow channel length was found to fall far short of the length required for turbulent flow to develop. However, it is known that increased contact time for heat transfer would occur if air were dragged down with the filament. Although modelling this effect {{is beyond the scope of}} the project, the heat transfer gradients are worsened by air-dragging and hence the model presented in this thesis reveals whether polymer uniformity is possible even under the best possible flow patterns. A negative result therefore indicates that non-uniformity will definitely occur...|$|R
