60|$|After {{passing for}} a few miles over the coast {{granitic}} series, {{we come to the}} porphyritic conglomerate, with its usual characters, and with some of the beds distinctly displaying their mechanical origin. The strata, where first met with, are, as before stated, only slightly inclined; but near the Hacienda of Pluclaro, we come to an <b>anticlinal</b> <b>axis,</b> with the beds much dislocated and shifted by a great fault, of which not a trace is externally seen in the outline of the hill. I believe that this <b>anticlinal</b> <b>axis</b> can be traced northwards, into the district of Arqueros, where a conspicuous hill called Cerro Blanco, formed of a harsh, cream-coloured euritic rock, including a few crystals of reddish feldspar, and associated with some purplish claystone porphyry, seems to fall on a line of elevation. In descending from the Arqueros district, I crossed on the northern border of the valley, strata inclined eastward from the Pluclaro axis: on the porphyritic conglomerate there rested a mass, some hundred feet thick, of brown argillaceous limestone, in parts crystalline, and in parts almost composed of Hippurites Chilensis, d'Orbigny; above this came a black calcareous shale, and on it a red conglomerate. In the brown limestone, with the Hippurites, there was an impression of a Pecten and a coral, and great numbers of a large Gryphaea, very like, and, according to Professor E. Forbes, probably identical with G. Orientalis, Forbes MS.,--a cretaceous species (probably upper greensand) from Verdachellum, in Southern India. These fossils seem to occupy nearly the same position with those at the Puente del Inca,--namely, {{at the top of the}} porphyritic conglomerate, and at the base of the gypseous formation.|$|E
60|$|The clouds early {{commenced}} gathering, and it {{was curious}} to watch their rapid formation in coalescing streaks, which became first cirrhi, and then stratus, being apparently continually added to from below by the moisture-bringing southerly wind. Ascending a lofty spur, 1000 feet above the valley, against which the moraine was banked, I {{found it to be}} a distinct <b>anticlinal</b> <b>axis.</b> The pass, bearing north-west, and the valley we had descended on the previous day, rose immediately over the curved strata of quartz, topped by the glacier-crowned mountain of Nango, with four glaciers descending from its perpetual snows. The stupendous cliffs on its flanks, under which I had camped on the previous night, were very grand, but not more so than those which dipped into the chasm of the Kambachen below. Looking up the valley of the latter, was another wilderness of ice full of enormous moraines, round the bases of which the river wound.|$|E
60|$|I {{will now}} give, first, {{a sketch of}} the {{structure}} of the range, as represented in the section, and will then describe its composition and interesting history. At its western foot, a hillock [N] is seen to rise out of the plain, with its strata dipping at 70 degrees to the west, fronted by strata [O] inclined at 45 degrees to the east, thus forming a little north and south <b>anticlinal</b> <b>axis.</b> Some other little hillocks of similar composition, with their strata highly inclined, range N.E. and S.W., obliquely to the main Uspallata line. The cause of these dislocations, which, though on a small scale, have been violent and complicated, is seen to lie in hummocks of lilac, purple and red porphyries, which have been injected in a liquified state through and into the underlying clay-slate formation. Several dykes were exposed here, but in no other part, that I saw of this range. As the strata consist of black, white, greenish and brown-coloured rocks, and as the intrusive porphyries are so brightly tinted, a most extraordinary view was presented, like a coloured geological drawing. On the gently inclined main western slope [PP], above the little anticlinal ridges just mentioned, the strata dip at an average angle of 25 degrees to the west; the inclination in some places being only 19 degrees, in some few others as much as 45 degrees. The masses having these different inclinations, are separated from each other by parallel vertical faults [as represented at Pa], often giving rise to separate, parallel, uniclinal ridges. The summit of the main range is broad and undulatory, with the stratification undulatory and irregular: in a few places granitic and porphyritic masses [Q] protrude, which, from the small effect they have locally produced in deranging the strata, probably form the upper points of a regular, great underlying dome. These denuded granitic points, I estimated at about nine thousand feet in height above the sea. On the eastern slope, the strata in the upper part are regularly inclined at about 25 degrees to the east, so that the summit of this chain, neglecting small irregularities, forms a broad <b>anticlinal</b> <b>axis.</b> Lower down, however, near Los Hornillos [R], there is a well-marked synclinal axis, beyond which the strata are inclined at nearly the same angle, namely from 20 to 30 degrees, inwards or westward. Owing to the amount of denudation which this chain has suffered, the outline of the gently inclined eastern flank scarcely offers the slightest indication of this synclinal axis. The stratified beds, which we have hitherto followed across the range, a little further down are seen to lie, I believe unconformably, on a broad mountainous band of clay-slate and grauwacke. The strata and laminae of this latter formation, on the extreme eastern flank, are generally nearly vertical; further inwards they become inclined from 45 to 80 degrees to the west: near Villa Vicencio [S] there is apparently an <b>anticlinal</b> <b>axis,</b> but the structure of this outer part of the clay-slate formation is so obscure, that I have not marked the planes of stratification in the section. On the margin of the Pampas, some low, much dislocated spurs of this same formation, project in a north- easterly line, in the same oblique manner as do the ridges on the western foot, and as is so frequently the case with those at the base of the main Cordillera.|$|E
50|$|The first form is in axial stretching. In this case, remote {{tensile stress}} is applied, {{allowing}} microcracks to open slightly throughout the tensile region. As these cracks open up, the stresses {{at the crack}} tips intensify, eventually exceeding the rock strength and allowing the fracture to propagate. This can occur at times of rapid overburden erosion. Folding also can provide tension, such as {{along the top of}} an <b>anticlinal</b> fold <b>axis,</b> where the tensile forces associated with the stretching of the upper half of the layers during folding can induce tensile fractures parallel to the fold axis.|$|R
60|$|Proceeding up the valley-basin of the Yeso, {{and taking}} our section {{sometimes}} {{on one hand}} and sometimes on the other, we come to a great hill of stratified porphyritic conglomerate [H] dipping at 45 degrees to the west; and a few hundred yards farther on, we have a bed between three or four hundred feet thick of gypsum [I] dipping eastward at a very high angle: here then we have a fault and <b>anticlinal</b> <b>axis.</b> On {{the opposite side of the}} valley, a vertical mass of red conglomerate, conformably underlying the gypsum, appears gradually to lose its stratification and passes into a mountain of porphyry. The gypsum [I] is covered by a bed [K], at least 1,000 feet in thickness, of a purplish-red, compact, heavy, fine-grained sandstone or mudstone, which fuses easily into a white enamel, and is seen under a lens to contain triturated crystals. This is succeeded by a bed [L], 1,000 feet thick (I believe I understate the thickness) of gypsum, exactly like the beds before described; and this again is capped by another great bed [M] of purplish-red sandstone. All these strata dip eastward; but the inclination becomes less and less, as we leave the first and almost vertical bed [I] of gypsum.|$|E
60|$|In {{the valley}} of the Despoblado, the stratification, as before remarked has been much disturbed, and in some points to a greater degree than I have {{anywhere}} else seen. I will give two cases: a very thick mass of thinly stratified red sandstone, including beds of conglomerate, has been crushed together (as represented in Figure 24) into a yoke or urn-formed trough, so that the strata on both sides have been folded inwards: on the right hand the properly underlying porphyritic claystone conglomerate is seen overlying the sandstone, but it soon becomes vertical, and then is inclined towards the trough, so that the beds radiate like the spokes of a wheel: on the left hand, the inverted porphyritic conglomerate also assumes a dip towards the trough, not gradually, as on the right hand, but by means of a vertical fault and synclinal break; and a little still further on towards the left, there is a second great oblique fault (both shown by the arrow- lines), with the strata dipping to a directly opposite point; these mountains are intersected by infinitely numerous dikes, some of which can be seen to rise from hummocks of greenstone, and can be traced for thousands of feet. In the second case, two low ridges trend together and unite {{at the head of a}} little wedge-shaped valley: throughout the right- hand ridge, the strata dip at 45 degrees to the east; in the left-hand ridge, we have the very same strata and at first with exactly the same dip; but in following this ridge up the valley, the strata are seen very regularly to become more and more inclined until they stand vertical, they then gradually fall over (the basset edges forming symmetrical serpentine lines along the crest), till at the very head of the valley they are reversed at an angle of 45 degrees: so that at this point the beds have been turned through an angle of 135 degrees; and here there is a kind of <b>anticlinal</b> <b>axis,</b> with the strata on both sides dipping to opposite points at an angle of 45 degrees, but those on the left hand upside down.|$|E
60|$|We {{now come}} to the gypseous formation: I will first {{describe}} {{the structure of the}} several mountains, and then give in one section a detailed account {{of the nature of the}} rocks. On the north side of the road, which here runs in an east and west valley, the mountain of porphyry [D] is succeeded by a hill [E] formed of the upper gypseous strata tilted, at an angle of between 70 and 80 degrees to the west, by a uniclinal axis of elevation which does not run parallel to the other neighbouring ranges, and which is of short length; for on the south side of the valley its prolongation is marked only by a small flexure in a pile of strata inclined by a quite separate axis. A little further on the north and south valley of Horcones enters at right angles our line of section; its western side is bounded by a hill of gypseous strata [F] dipping westward at about 45 degrees, and its eastern side by a mountain of similar strata [G] inclined westward at 70 degrees, and superimposed by an oblique fault on another mass of the same strata [H], also inclined westward, but at an angle of about 30 degrees: the complicated relation of these three masses [F, G, H] is explained by the structure of a great mountain-range lying some way to the north, in which a regular <b>anticlinal</b> <b>axis</b> (represented in the section by dotted lines) is seen, with the strata on its eastern side again bending up and forming a distinct uniclinal axis, of which the beds marked [H] form the lower part. This great uniclinal line is intersected, near the Puente del Inca, by the valley along which the road runs, and the strata composing it will be immediately described. On the south side of the road, in the space corresponding with the mountains [E, F, and G], the strata everywhere dip westward generally at an angle of 30 degrees, occasionally mounting up to 45 degrees, but not in an unbroken line, for there are several vertical faults, forming separate uniclinal masses, all dipping in the same direction,--a form of elevation common in the Cordillera. We thus see that within a narrow space, the gypseous strata have been upheaved and crushed together by a great uniclinal, anticlinal, and one lesser uniclinal line [E] of elevation; and that between these three lines and the Cumbre, in the sandstones, conglomerates and porphyritic formation, there have been at least two or three other great elevatory axes.|$|E
60|$|This axis {{consists}} of a broad mountainous mass [O] of andesite, composed of albite, brown mica, and chlorite, passing into andesitic granite, with quartz: on its western side it has thrown off, at a considerable angle, a thick mass of stratified porphyries, including much epidote [NN], and remarkable only from being divided into very thin beds, as highly amygdaloidal on their surfaces as subaerial lava-streams are often vesicular. This porphyritic formation is conformably covered, as seen some way up the ravine of Jolquera, by a mere remnant of {{the lower part of}} the cretaceo-oolitic formation [MM], which in one part encases, as represented in the coloured section, the foot of the andesitic axis [L], of the already described fifth line, and in another part entirely conceals it: in this latter case, the gypseous or cretaceo-oolitic strata falsely appeared to dip under the porphyritic conglomerate of the fifth axis. The lowest bed of the gypseous formation, as seen here [M], is of yellowish siliceous sandstone, precisely like that of Amolanas, interlaced in parts with veins of gypsum, and including layers of the black, calcareous, non-fissile slate-rock: the Turritella Andii, Pecten Dufreynoyi, Terebratula aenigma, var., and some Gryphites were embedded in these layers. The sandstone varies in thickness from only twenty to eighty feet; and this variation is caused by the inequalities in the upper surface of an underlying stream of purple claystone porphyry. Hence the above fossils here lie at the very base of the gypseous or cretaceo-oolitic formation, and hence they were probably once covered up by strata about seven thousand feet in thickness: it is, however, possible, though from the nature of all the other sections in this district not probable, that the porphyritic claystone lava may in this case have invaded a higher level in the series. Above the sandstone there is a considerable mass of much indurated, purplish-black, calcareous claystone, allied in nature to the often-mentioned black calcareous slate- rock. Eastward of the broad andesitic axis of this sixth line, and penetrated by many dikes from it, there is a great formation [P] of mica-schist, with its usual variations, and passing in one part into a ferruginous quartz-rock. The folia are curved and highly inclined, generally dipping eastward. It is probable that this mica-schist is an old formation, connected with the granitic rocks and metamorphic schists near the coast; and that the one fragment of mica-slate, and the pebbles of quartz low down in the gypseous formation at Las Amolanas, have been derived from it. The mica-schist is succeeded by stratified porphyritic conglomerate [Q] of great thickness, dipping eastward with a high inclination: I have included this latter mountain-mass in the same <b>anticlinal</b> <b>axis</b> with the porphyritic streams [NN]; but I am far from sure that the two masses may not have been independently upheaved.|$|E

30|$|In January 2010, we {{conducted}} a multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection survey in Sagami Bay. As {{a result of this}} study, the deformation of the Manazuru Knoll, which is located near the plate boundary, was obtained. The Manazuru Knoll was formed by an asymmetric anticline, and the knoll has a geometry that is bent in a shape similar to that of a crank. The <b>anticlinal</b> <b>axis,</b> which was confirmed by MCS data, lies along the <b>anticlinal</b> <b>axis</b> shown on the bathymetric map, and the axis is bent first to the southeast and then to the east. It is estimated that the easternmost part of Manazuru Knoll has reached the vicinity of Miura Canyon. The offset of the strike of the anticline axis is approximately 7  km. A reverse fault related to the formation of Manazuru Knoll was identified in the southwestern side of the knoll. It is hypothesized that this reverse fault formed as a result of shortening of the structure, which occurred when the relative motion of the Philippine Sea plate was acting in a perpendicular direction close to the Manazuru Knoll. Therefore, it is estimated that the relative motion of the Philippine Sea plate was almost oblique or parallel to the <b>anticlinal</b> <b>axis</b> of Manazuru Knoll and that the eastern end of Manazuru Knoll was bent into a crank shape by strike-slip motion. This suggests that a part of Manazuru Knoll, located {{to the west of the}} plate boundary, moved to the northwest. Finally, it is assumed that the sediments of Miura Canyon and Sagami Knoll have been overlapping on the eastern end of Manazuru Knoll.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Bourail Anticline {{in central}} New Caledonia {{has been a}} target for {{petroleum}} exploration since the 1950 s.

40|$|Since {{the first}} {{discovery}} of the thermally metamorphosed rocks characterized by the growth of large andulsite porphyrobrasts in 1959 from Ainoshima, the author has studied the Ainoshima and Enoshima formations {{in relation to the}} granitic rocks of a Cretaceous age. The lithologic features of the Ainoshima thermally metamorphosed rocks were already delivered in the previous Ainoshima papar. The Enoshima formation which is mainly composed of slates, tuffaceous sandstones, tuffs, conglomeates, volcanic breccias and lavas is intruded by the Hirukojima granodiorite which bears a closed relation to the Nishisonogi granitic rocks, and is disconformably overlain by the early Paleogene Minamise formation in which the andesite and porphyrite pebbles consisting the Enoshima formation are abundantly found. The writer included the Enoshima in the Kammon group and compared it the Ainoshima formation from the lithologic features. It should especially noted that these two formations contain the thin, somewhat impure limestone layers and large limestone pebbles. In this paper, furthermore, the geologic structure of this area was discussed based upon these Tertiay basement rocks arranged from east to west.

40|$|Active {{tectonics}} of a deformation front constrains the kinematic {{evolution and}} structural {{interaction between the}} fold-thrust belt and the most-recently accreted foreland basin. At the Himalayan deformation front, the thrust front is blind, characterized by a broad fold (the Suruin-Mastgarh anticline (SMA)), and displays no emergent faults cutting the southern limb. Dated deformed terraces on the Ujh River constrain the structural style of deformation and shortening rates. Six terraces are recognized, and three yield OSL ages of 53 ka, 33 ka, and 0. 4 ka.

40|$|The Pabdeh-Lali Anticline of {{northern}} Khuzestan province {{is located in}} southwestern Iran and occupies 790 km 2. This structure is situated in the Zagros folded belt. As a result of well-developed karst systems in the <b>anticlinal</b> <b>axis,</b> the water supply potential is high and is drained by many peripheral springs. However, there is a scarcity of water for agriculture and population centers on the anticlinal flanks, which imposes a severe problem in terms of area development. This study combines remotely sensed (RS) data and a geographical infor-mation system (GIS) into a RSGIS technique to delineate new areas for groundwater development and specific sites for drilling productive water wells. Toward these goals, RS data were used to develop GIS layers for lithology, structural geology, topographic slope, elevation, and drainage density. Field measurements were made to create spring-location and groundwater-quality GIS layers. Subsequently, expert choice and relational methods were used in a GIS environment to conjunctively analyze all layers to delineate preferable regions and 43 individual sites in which to drill water wells. Results indicate that the most preferred areas are, in preferential order, within recent alluvial deposits, the Bakhtiyari Conglomerates, and the Aghajari Sandstone. The Asmari Limestone and other units have much lower potential for groundwater supplies. Potential usefulness of the RSGIS method was indicated when six out of nine producing wells recently drilled by the Khozestan Water and Power Authority (which {{had no knowledge of}} this study) were located in areas preferentially selected by this technique...|$|E
30|$|A reverse fault, {{which is}} related to the {{formation}} of Manazuru Knoll, is clearly developed to the southwest of the knoll in lines A to D. Ohkouchi (1990) interpreted that a reverse fault formed from east to west at the southern margin of the Manazuru Knoll. We suppose that this reverse fault on the southwestern margin of Manazuru Knoll was formed by structural shortening when the relative motion of the Philippine Sea plate was acting in a perpendicular direction near Manazuru Knoll. Therefore, it is estimated that the relative motion of the Philippine Sea plate was almost oblique or parallel to the <b>anticlinal</b> <b>axis</b> of Manazuru Knoll and that the eastern end of Manazuru Knoll was bent into a crank shape by right-lateral strike-slip motion. As a result, it is estimated that most of Manazuru Knoll, which was located {{to the west of the}} plate boundary, has been moving to the northwest. In addition, because the development of the crank-shaped deformation by right-lateral strike-slip motion corresponds with the present plate motion, we suppose that the development of the crank-shaped deformation occurred later than the formation of the anticline and reverse fault by shortening motion. Accordingly, the relationship between a structure of the Manazuru Knoll formed by shortening and the crank-shaped bend structure formed by the right-lateral strike-slip motion indicates the history of the plate boundary in the northern Sagami Trough. Furthermore, according to a previous study of calcareous nannofossil ages in and around the Sagami Knoll, the geological age of the southern outcrop is older than that of the northern outcrop (Kanie et al. 1999). Comparing this study with the previous study, we suggest that the base of the outcrop of the southern Sagami Knoll is the same as that of the Manazuru Knoll.|$|E
40|$|An {{incorporation}} of seismic {{data from the}} Maverick Basin with other studies reveals influence from the Paleozoic Ouachita thrust on the Triassic-Jurassic Chittim Rift?s formation {{and the influence of}} this rift on the later Cretaceous-Eocene Laramide compressional event. These features are the geologic remnant of a complete cycle of continental tectonics; from collision to rifting and eventual flooding. Signatures of all of these events are preserved in the subsurface of southwest Texas. I suggest that tectonic inheritance at a range of scales is recognized in the successive imprints of the continental margins preserved within the crust of the present Maverick Basin. The lithology and structure of a portion of the Maverick Basin in Maverick and Kinney Counties, Texas, have been reanalyzed using a new 3 D seismic volume and two existing 2 D seismic profiles. Amplitude reflectors in the volume were traced, mapped and correlated with reflectors in the 2 D lines. These data were compared with published well data and used to develop a stratigraphic-structural model of the basin identifying the probably lithologies of the subsurface layers and key structural features. The geographic and geologic relationships established are used to illustrate a sequence of tectonic inheritance and the role of preexisting structural styles in subsequent tectonic events. The model reveals northeast directed thrusting of Paleozoic marine sediments along a west-northwest to east-southeast striking thrust fault related to the Ouachita Orogeny. This thrusting abated against the pre-existing Devil?s River Uplift north of the study area. Subsequent to thrusting, Triassic-Jurassic rifting formed the Chittim Rift, one of many half-graben sub-basins to form in the Maverick Basin during this time. The orientation of the rift axis parallel to the Ouachita thrust fault and not to the ultimate spreading center in the Gulf of Mexico, suggests utilization of pre-existing structural weaknesses. A left lateral transform fault active during rifting potentially formed along an existing tear fault in the Ouachita thrust. Movement along this fault constrained the northern wall of the Chittim Rift as well as lead to a stratigraphically distinct mini-basin within the Chittim Rift from pull-apart motion along the fault. Compression during the Laramide Orogeny produced the Chittim Anticline in Cretaceous marine layers above the Chittim Rift. The Chittim <b>anticlinal</b> <b>axis</b> is parallel and geographically collocated with the Chittim Rift axis, providing further evidence of tectonic inheritance and utilization of pre-exiting features. The data presented here helps to demonstrate the role of inherited structural features from specific tectonic events at the local scale on subsequent sedimentation and deformation, and how the presence of these local-scale subsurface features are significant to the overall development of the current south Texas continental margin. The resultant stratigraphic-structural model of this portion of the Maverick Basin helps to further unravel the history of the Gulf of Mexico passive margin specifically, and the development of passive margins in general, where features may not always appear to be oriented optimally to the far-field stress state. The study also presents a clear interpretation of the little-studied Central Maverick Basin area and adds to the limited studies on the region...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Oct. 27, 2014 - Oct. 27, 2015 Active tectonics of a deformation front constrains the kinematic evolution and structural interaction between the fold-thrust belt and the most-recently accreted foreland basin. At the Himalayan deformation front, the thrust front is blind, characterized by a broad fold (the Suruin-Mastgarh anticline (SMA)), and displays no emergent faults cutting the southern limb. Dated deformed terraces on the Ujh River constrain the structural style of deformation and shortening rates. Six terraces are recognized, and three yield OSL ages of 53 ka, 33 ka, and 0. 4 ka. Terrace restorations through long profiles reveal a deformation pattern characterized by uniform uplift across the <b>anticlinal</b> <b>axis</b> and northern limb, and variable uplift due to rotation of the southern limb. Offset terraces occur between the fold trace and the northern limb. Bedrock dips, stratigraphic thicknesses, and cross sections suggest that a SW-directed duplex at depth drives uniform uplift in the north, and a NE directed wedge thrust drives variable tilt in the south. Localized faulting at the fold axis introduces asymmetrical fold geometry. Folding of the oldest dated terrace suggests rock uplift rates across the SMA range between 1. 8 and 2. 0 mm/yr. Assuming a 25 °-dip for the duplex ramp {{on the basis of}} dip data constraints, the shortening rate across the SMA ranges between 3. 8 - 5. 4 mm/yr or 4. 6 mm/yr since 53 ka. Of that rate, 2. 7 - 1. 1 mm/yr is likely absorbed by faulting at the fold axis. In comparison, long-term bedrock shortening rates are consistent with our data of Pleistocene shortening rates. Cross sections at the Ujh River transects and Chenab reentrant indicate 6. 5 mm/yr and 4 mm/yr, respectively, using an onset age of thrusting of 3 Ma. Within the Sub-Himalaya deformation belt, new geomorphic mapping demonstrates that active emergent thrust faulting occurs north of the deformation thrust front in the Kashmir Himalaya. The Riasi thrust (RT) comprises the southeastern strand of a 250 km-long seismically active fault system in Pakistan and Indian Kashmir. Multiple fault strands with Quaternary activity characterize the fault zone near the Chenab River. Vertical separation of 272 m of Pleistocene fluvial deposits marks the main strand of the RT, or the Main Riasi thrust (MRT). A shortening rate of 10. 8 - 2. 8 mm/yr characterizes a 91 - 39 ka time interval for the MRT at this location. A fault scarp and offset Holocene terrace mark the southernmost and frontal splay of the RT fault zone, called here the Frontal Riasi thrust (FRT). Differential uplift (21. 6 ± 1 m) of a Holocene terrace yields a preferred shortening rate of 8. 8 - 4. 4 mm/yr. Contact relationships in a trench across the FRT date the last surface rupture of the RT fault zone at 4, 500 yrs ago. Average shortening rates since 100 ka across the MRT and the FRT range from 10. 8 mm/yr to 4. 4 mm/yr (7. 6 ± 3. 3 mm/yr), consistent with long-term bedrock shortening of 10 - 14 mm/yr since 5 Ma. Given that Himalayan-Indian convergence is 11 - 18 mm/yr, the sum of the intermediate-term shortening rates for the RT (10. 8 - 4. 4 mm/yr) and the deformation front (5. 4 - 3. 8 mm/yr), accounts for most of the total geological shortening in Kashmir. Using average rates, internal faults (RT) absorb 50...|$|E
