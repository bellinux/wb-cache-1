5|$|Further along {{from the}} Welsh Bridge is the Porthill Bridge, <b>a</b> <b>pedestrian</b> {{suspension}} bridge running between the Quarry and Porthill, built in 1922. The next bridge {{along the river}} is Kingsland Bridge, a privately owned toll bridge, and the subsequent bridge is the Greyfriars Bridge, <b>a</b> <b>pedestrian</b> bridge between Coleham and the town centre. Following the Greyfriars Bridge is the English Bridge, historically called Stone Bridge, which was rebuilt in the 1930s. Beyond it is the railway station, which is partly built over the river. After the station is Castle Walk Footbridge, another modern pedestrian footbridge.|$|E

5|$|In the 2000s, the {{old city}} centre {{underwent}} extensive restoration works, meant to convert much of it into <b>a</b> <b>pedestrian</b> area, including Bulevardul Eroilor, Unirii Square and other smaller streets.

40|$|University campuses have {{thousands}} of new students, staff and visitors every year. For those who are unfamiliar with the campus environment, <b>an</b> effective <b>pedestrian</b> navigation system is essential to orientate and guide them around the campus. Compared to traditional navigation systems, such as physical signposts and digital map kiosks, <b>a</b> mobile <b>pedestrian</b> navigation system provides advantages in terms of mobility, sensing capabilities, weather-awareness when the user is on the go. However, how best to design <b>a</b> mobile <b>pedestrian</b> navigation system for university campuses is still vague due to limited research in understanding how pedestrians interact with the system, and what information is required for traveling in a complex environment such as university campus. In this paper, we present <b>a</b> mobile <b>pedestrian</b> navigation system called QUT Nav. A field study with eight participants was run in a university campus context, aiming to identify key information required in <b>a</b> mobile <b>pedestrian</b> navigation system for user traveling in university campuses. It also investigated user's interactions and behaviours while they were navigating in the campus environment. Based on {{the results from the}} field study, a recommendation for designing mobile pedestrian navigation systems for university campuses is stated...|$|R
40|$|Pedestrian {{simulation}} {{has many}} applications in computer games, military simulations, and animation systems. <b>A</b> realistic <b>pedestrian</b> simulation requires <b>a</b> realistic <b>pedestrian</b> behavioral model {{that takes into}} account the various behavioral aspects of <b>a</b> real <b>pedestrian.</b> In this article, we describe our work on such a model, which aims to generate human-like pedestrian behaviors. To this end, various important factors in a real-pedestrian's decision-making process are considered in our model. These factors include a pedestrian's sensory attention, memory, and navigational behaviors. In particular, a two-level navigation model is proposed to generate realistic navigational behavior. As <b>a</b> result, our <b>pedestrian</b> model is able to generate various realistic behaviors such as overtaking, waiting, side-stepping and lane-forming in a crowded area. The simulated pedestrians are also able to navigate through complex environment, given an abstract map of the environment...|$|R
