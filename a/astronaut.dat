50|$|A Maximum Absorbency Garment (MAG) is a {{piece of}} {{clothing}} NASA <b>astronauts</b> wear during liftoff, landing, and extra-vehicular activity (EVA) to absorb urine and feces. It is worn by both male and female <b>astronauts.</b> <b>Astronauts</b> can urinate into the MAG, and usually wait to defecate when they return to the spacecraft. However, the MAG is rarely used for this purpose, since the <b>astronauts</b> use the facilities of the station before EVA and also time the consumption of the in-suit water. Nonetheless, the garment provides peace of mind for the <b>astronauts.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{physiologic}} and pathologic changes {{associated with}} microgravity exposure {{have been studied}} extensively, {{the effect of this}} environment on the eye is largely unknown. Over the last several years, NASA s Space Medicine Division has documented <b>astronauts</b> presenting with varying degrees of disc edema, globe flattening, choroidal folds, cotton wool spots, and hyperopic shifts after long-duration space flight. Methods: Before and after long-duration space flight, six <b>astronauts</b> underwent complete eye examinations to include cycloplegic and/or manifest refraction and fundus photography. Five of these <b>astronauts</b> had Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) performed following their missions. Results: Following exposure to space flight of approximately 6 -months duration, six <b>astronauts</b> had neuro-ophthalmic findings. These consisted of disc edema in four <b>astronauts,</b> globe flattening in four <b>astronauts,</b> choroidal folds in four <b>astronauts,</b> cotton wool spots in three <b>astronauts,</b> nerve fiber layer thickening by OCT in five <b>astronauts,</b> and decreased near vision in five <b>astronauts.</b> Four of the <b>astronauts</b> with near vision complaints had a hyperopic shift equal to or greater than + 0. 50 D between pre- and post-mission spherical equivalent refraction in one or both eyes (range + 0. 50 D to + 1. 50 D). These same four had globe flattening by MRI. Conclusions: The findings we describe may have resulted from a rise in intracranial pressure caused by microgravity fluid shifts, and could represent parts of a spectrum of ocular and cerebral responses to extended microgravity...|$|R
40|$|Our {{laboratory}} {{previously reported}} {{that the incidence of}} orthostatic hypotension (OH) was greater after long- than short-duration spaceflight in <b>astronauts</b> who participated in Mir Space Station and Space Shuttle missions. To confirm and extend these findings, we retrospectively examined tilt test data from International Space Station (ISS) and Shuttle <b>astronauts.</b> We anticipated that the proportion of ISS <b>astronauts</b> experiencing OH would be high on landing day and the number of days to recover greater after long- than short-duration missions. Methods: Twenty ISS and 66 Shuttle <b>astronauts</b> participated in 10 -min 80 ? head-up tilt tests 10 d before launch (L- 10), on landing day (R+ 0) or 1 d after landing (R+ 1). Data from 5 ISS <b>astronauts</b> tested on R+ 0 or R+ 1 who used non-standard countermeasures were excluded. Many <b>astronauts</b> repeated the test 3 d (R+ 3) after landing. Fisher?s Exact Test was used to compare the ability of ISS and Shuttle <b>astronauts</b> to complete the tilt test on R+ 0. Cox regression was used to identify cardiovascular parameters that were associated with test completion across all tests, and mixed model analysis was used to compare the change and recovery rates between ISS and Shuttle <b>astronauts.</b> In these analyses, ISS data from R+ 0 and R+ 1 were pooled to provide sufficient statistical power. Results: The proportion of <b>astronauts</b> who completed the tilt test on R+ 0 without OH was less in ISS than in Shuttle <b>astronauts</b> (p= 0. 03). On R+ 0, only 2 of 6 ISS <b>astronauts</b> completed the test compared to 53 of 66 (80 %) Shuttle <b>astronauts.</b> However, 8 of 9 ISS <b>astronauts</b> completed the test on R+ 1. On R+ 3, 13 of 15 (87 %) of the ISS and 19 of 19 (100 %) of the Shuttle <b>astronauts</b> completed the 10 -min test. An index comprised of stroke volume and diastolic blood pressure provided a very good prediction of overall tilt survival. This index was altered by spaceflight similarly for both groups soon after landing (pooled R+ 0 and R+ 1), but ISS <b>astronauts</b> did not recover {{at the same rate as}} Shuttle <b>astronauts</b> (p= 0. 007). Conclusions: The proportion of ISS <b>astronauts</b> who could not complete the tilt test on R+ 0 due to OH (4 of 6) is similar to that reported in <b>astronauts</b> who flew on Mir (5 of 6). Further, cardiovascular parameters most closely associated with OH recover more slowly after long- compared to short-duration spaceflight...|$|R

He made his first space flight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian <b>astronaut</b> to fly in space. He performed the first docking of two spacecraft, with pilot David Scott. This mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his reentry control fuel to prevent a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster, in the first in-flight space emergency.|$|E

Kei Oumi befriends Asumi during the academy's entrance examination and is portrayed with an outgoing personality and a deep sense of loyalty toward her friends. Marika Ukita initially responds coldly toward gestures of friendship, but she moves into Asumi's dormitory following an argument with her father.
