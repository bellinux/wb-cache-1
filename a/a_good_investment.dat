500|$|Remarking that Brain Age 2 {{uses the}} same formula as Brain Age [...] "with some {{different}} variables thrown in", Game Informer noted that players' opinions of the original Brain Age {{will most likely be}} similar to how much they appreciate Brain Age 2. GameZone was excited about the Sudoku portion of the game, which they complimented was [...] "worth the entire game itself and will provide many hours of fun". They found the daily training and quick play modes [...] "simply addictive", and appreciated the game's [...] "simple and easy to use interface". The video game website IGN felt differently, however, noting that the challenges felt fresh, with the exception of Sudoku. IGN agreed with GameZone on a particular point, however, writing that both the original Brain Age, and Brain Age 2, have [...] "calm, clean interface". The television series X-Play was intrigued by Brain Age 2s promise to improve a person's intelligence. GameSpy called the game [...] "the ideal video game gateway drug" [...] because of its accessibility {{to a wide variety of}} people, lack of requirements for special physical dexterity or experience, and regular reward system to motivate the player. They also considered Brain Age 2 a [...] "noble effort towards the betterment of our mental health through a painless training regimen". Game Revolution complimented the game's intelligent use of Nintendo DS features, [...] "fun" [...] sound effects, and [...] "competent" [...] handwriting recognition. Singapore's The Straits Times considered Brain Age 2 <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>investment,</b> despite noting that hardcore gamers might find the minigames [...] "gimmicky". Recognizing that Nintendo intends to use the game to target baby boomers, The Globe and Mail writes that they were tempted to play the game at work and justify it as a self-improvement program.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{tariffs and}} other policies {{designed to protect}} the domestic <b>investment</b> <b>good</b> industry in <b>a</b> small open economy. In a dynamic two-sector model, where <b>a</b> nontraded <b>investment</b> <b>good</b> competes with <b>an</b> imported <b>investment</b> <b>good,</b> the paper identifies two channels through which commercial policies affect the domestic sector: one through the standard substitution of the domestic for the foreign <b>investment</b> <b>good</b> and the other through their effect on Tobin's q and the aggregate investment demand. If a commercial policy decreases investment sufficiently, it can hurt the domestic industry in both the short and the long run. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a pecuniary transactions costs (TC) approach to reexamine the principal relationships and results concerning inflation and growth. In a {{model with a}} general TC function and an endogenous labor-leisure choice, we consider four special cases by distinguishing among money as (1) <b>a</b> consumption <b>good,</b> (2) <b>a</b> production <b>good,</b> (3) <b>an</b> <b>investment</b> <b>good,</b> and (4) <b>a</b> consumption <b>good</b> as well as <b>an</b> <b>investment</b> <b>good.</b> Under some weaker conditions as in related studies, a reversed Tobin effect obtains for all cases: a high monetary growth rate leads to lower steady-state capital, labor, consumption, and real money balances. These findings suggest that a pecuniary TC model is qualitatively equivalent to alternative models in the literature. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

These functions may be separated (with market participants concentrating on one or the other function) or combined (in the case of the person that lives in a house that they own). This dual nature of the good means that {{it is not uncommon for}} people to over-invest in real estate—that is, to invest more money in an asset than it is worth on the open market.|$|R

In early 2017, a New York City taxi medallion sold for a record low of $241,000, compared to the $1.3 million price tag they sold for just 4 years prior.|$|E
2500|$|Though Lake County was a Republican stronghold, Daly {{was easily}} elected County Judge in 1902, a {{position}} he continued to hold {{until his death in}} 1920. [...] During his tenure as Lake County’s chief executive, the county built a new court house in 1909 using tax revenue from land left by the defunct Oregon Central Military Wagon Road Company. [...] In 1916, Lake County became the first county in eastern Oregon to issue bonds for highway construction. [...] When the bonds failed to sell as expected, Daly bought the remaining bonds himself. [...] Since the bonds paid six percent interest, it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>investment</b> as well as a savvy political move.|$|E

She attended West High School and became involved in many school activities and organizations. She frequently worked on editing the school's yearbook and was elected student vice president of her senior class. Due to her father's influence, Helen planned on attending college at Stanford. But the cost of tuition was too much for her parents to consider. According to Helen, her parents believed that [...] "girls were not considered <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>investment</b> in higher education as they would only get married, while boys were worth it". However, Helen's father agreed to pay for her attendance at the University of Utah. She attended school for several years, but did not graduate.|$|E

2500|$|Weber {{consciously}} {{resisted the}} industry's movement toward assembly line-style studio film making. [...] "By concentrating {{on only one}} production at a time, and mobilizing her entire work force around that effort, Weber aimed for quality film making rather than efficient bookkeeping". Weber's independence allowed her to shoot her films in sequence, as she preferred (rather than out of order to suit production schedules). William D. Routt indicates that [...] "Lois Weber Productions were <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>investment,</b> cost-effective. The company made movies cheaply: in later years at least shooting on location even for interiors, using a small cast, working fast. Its somewhat sensational topics and titles guaranteed at least a modest box office return, and at times may have done much better than that." ...|$|E

After graduating, {{he worked as}} a security analyst, where he realised that [...] "how to estimate the fair value was a puzzle indeed... To be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>investment</b> analyst, one needs to be an expert economist also." [...] In 1932 he enrolled at Harvard for a Ph.D. in economics, with the hopes of learning what had caused the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the subsequent economic depression of the 1930s. For his thesis, Joseph Schumpeter suggested the question of the intrinsic value of a common stock, for which Williams' personal experience and background would serve him in good stead. He received his doctorate in 1940.|$|E
