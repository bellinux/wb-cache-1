500|$|Morgan {{and his men}} {{remained}} in Porto Bello for a month. He wrote to Don Agustín, the acting president of Panama, to demand a ransom {{for the city of}} 350,000 pesos. As they stripped the city of its wealth it is probable that torture was used on the residents to uncover hidden caches of money and jewels. Zahedieh records that there were no first-hand reports from witnesses that confirmed Exquemelin's claim of widespread rape and debauchery. After an attempt by Don Agustín to recapture the city by force – his army of 800 soldiers was repelled by the privateers – he negotiated a ransom of 100,000 pesos. Following the ransom and the plunder of the city, Morgan returned to Port Royal, with between £70,000 and £100,000 of money and valuables; Zahedieh reports that the figures were more than the agricultural output of Jamaica, and nearly half Barbados's sugar exports. Each privateer received £120 – equivalent to five or six times the <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>earnings</b> of a sailor of the time. Morgan received a five per cent share for his work; Modyford received a ten per cent share, which was the price of Morgan's letter of marque.

40|$|The {{data used}} in the present study were {{recorded}} at the Algerian Horse Racing Society for 36492 racing performance of 913 Arabian horses from 1995 to 2007. The aim of the study was to identify the genetic parameters underlying three traits: two earnings traits, namely the logarithm of <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> virtual <b>earnings</b> (LAEV) and the logarithm of <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> virtual <b>earnings</b> per start (LAEV/S), and a ranking trait, the normalized ranking (PERF). To identify the fixed effects to be included in the genetic mixed model, a preliminary analysis was conducted using the General Linear Models (GLM) procedure from SAS software. The effects of age, sex, year and the interaction between year of the race and age and between sex and age were included in the model for the three traits. Afterwards, two random effects, a direct genetic effect of the animal and a permanent environmental effect were included in the mixed model. The variance components and genetic parameters were estimated using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) procedure with the MTDFREML program. The analyses with this repeatable animal model led to the following estimation of the genetic parameters: for LAEV, heritability was 0. 225 (± 0. 041), while estimate of repeatability was 0. 330 (± 0. 040). For LAEV/S, heritability was 0. 164 (± 0. 027), while estimate of repeatability was 0. 215 (± 0. 022). The heritability for the normalized ranking was higher, 0. 369 (± 0. 054), indicating that this trait might provide faster progress for breeding programs of Arabian horses in Algeria. The repeatability estimate for the normalized ranking was 0. 587 (± 0. 045). The genetic correlation between LAEV and LAEV/S was 0. 99, revealing a almost complete genetic dependence between these two traits, 0. 69 between PERF and LAEV and 0. 79 between PERF and LAEV/S.

30|$|Throughout {{this study}} we have used Indigenous {{self-identification}} as a key variable. It is however possible that individuals self-identify as Indigenous depending {{on the evolution of}} their economic success or failure. In order to investigate whether this could be biasing the results, we can use the MxFLS data, since this is a panel, and see whether individuals change their responses to the question of Indigenous self-identification depending on their economic condition. To this end we identified individuals who changed the response to the Indigenous self-identification question. Then among those who changed their response, we have two groups for those who changed their self-identification from: (i) Indigenous to Mestizo and (ii) Mestizo to Indigenous. We also calculated the <b>annual</b> <b>earnings</b> change. Our results indicate that in the MxFLS data there are 183 cases in which individuals changed their identification from Indigenous to Mestizo. Among these 183 cases, the <b>average</b> change in <b>annual</b> <b>earnings</b> is a positive change of 50.17 % with a standard error of 17.07 %. Similarly, there are 189 cases in which the individual changed their identification from Mestizo to Indigenous. Among these 189 cases, the <b>average</b> change in <b>annual</b> <b>earnings</b> is a also a positive change of 50.63 % with a standard error of 10.99 %. Hence, it is not the case that individuals who change their self-identification from Indigenous to Mestizo experience positive wage growth and that those who change their self-identification from Mestizo to Indigenous experience negative wage growth. The limited change in self-identification is unlikely to have an effect on our results.|$|R

40|$|The overall aim of {{the thesis}} is to extract from a {{hitherto}} under-used data set {{a wide range of}} statistics that enable the calculation of <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> <b>earnings</b> for a geographically and occupationally diverse group of workers. The period covered is 1896 to 1913 and essentially attempts to draw economic and welfare inferences from spatial and time series analysis by occupational sector and between geographical location. The extent of the data may be exemplified by noting that the number of workers represented is 52, 977 in 1896 and 178, 674 in 1913. The thesis is divided into three sections as follows: 1. The introductory part discusses in general terms the measurement of economic and labour market conditions in the period, the relative importance of this issue, and difficulties that exist due to lack of representative data. The second part attempts to justify the use of data for <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> <b>earnings</b> of co-operative society workers as giving some representation of market wages. This is covered by two chapters, one qualitative and one quantative 2. The first part of this section draws upon statistics from productive societies in the Movement. The data is arranged by sector and comparisons are made with existing work by Bowley, Wood and Feinstein. Additional data is drawn from the Labour Gazette in the period and the results seem to suggest that, when actual earnings rather than wage rates are used, annual and periodic levels of income show greater variance. The possibility that these variances may be an indication of underlying economic and labour market conditions is discussed in detail. The second part of this section uses data from the largest section of the Movement, the distributive side. A database (Access) has been created and statistics on <b>annual</b> <b>average</b> <b>earnings</b> entered for all 1, 167 distributive societies in 1906 (62, 465 workers). A total of 890 have been mapped onto an outline of Great Britain. This data is also presented at metropolitan and regional levels of analysis for comparative purposes. 3.

Relative distress within the diverse economy that existed in the period has been an area of quite considerable discussion and authors have used a number of proxy measures - for example poor law returns, data for the recovery of small debts, marriage rates and trade union unemployment returns - to measure these variations.

40|$|A key {{policy issue}} in many {{countries}} is the maldistribution of doctors across geographic areas, which has important effects on equity of access and health care costs. Many government programs and incentive schemes have been established to encourage doctors to practise in rural areas. However, there is little robust evidence {{of the effectiveness of}} such incentive schemes. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the preferences of general practitioners (GPs) for rural location using a discrete choice experiment. This is used to estimate the probabilities of moving to a rural area, and the size of financial incentives GPs would require to move there. GPs were asked to choose between two job options or to stay at their current job as part of the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL) longitudinal survey of doctors. 3727 GPs completed the experiment. Sixty five per cent of GPs chose to stay where they were in all choices presented to them. Moving to an inland town with less than 5000 population and reasonable levels of other job characteristics would require incentives equivalent to 64 % of current <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> personal <b>earnings</b> ($ 116, 000). Moving to a town with a population between 5000 and 20, 000 people would require incentives of at least 37 % of current <b>annual</b> <b>earnings,</b> around $ 68, 000.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project is to identify the most relevant independent factors affecting the annual growth in the demand for electricity in Darwin over a period commencing 1990 to 1994. The three econometric equations to be estimated are the annual energy consumption equations (GWh) for both domestic and commercial sectors and the maximum demand equation (MW). The linear regression analysis is used to estimate the three econometric equations. The location considered in the study is a geographical area covering the cities of Darwin and Palmerston. The independent variables that have been considered suitable to outline the variation of annual energy consumption in both the domestic and commercial sectors are the Darwin population, number of electricity consumers, tariff structure, <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>earnings,</b> gross state product per capita, level of housing finance commitment and the prevailing weather patterns. It is found that factors such as number of domestic consumers and <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>earnings</b> are suitable to explain variations in the domestic energy consumption estimate. However, at the selected 5 % level of significance, only the number of domestic consumers stands as the most suitable independent variable to estimate the annual domestic energy consumption equation. Similar result {{is found in the}} case of estimating the commercial energy consumption equation, the commercial consumers independent variable is best used to predict variations in the annual commercial energy consumption. The domestic energy consumption and the commercial energy consumption independent variables are found to provide the most appropriate means in estimating the maximum demand equation.  The forecast of these econometric equations will assist the Supply Authority to plan ahead for future Electricity Generation, Transmission and Distribution expansion or augmentation. It will also provide a means to assess future long-term fuel contracts as well as to evaluate appropriate capital investment requirements for domestic and commercial consumers...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} the flat races {{organized}} in Algeria from 1995 to 2007 by the Algerian Horse Racing Society were used to estimate non-genetic parameters of racing performances of Thoroughbred horses. Performances were assessed through two earnings traits (the logarithm of annual virtual earnings: LAEV and the logarithm of <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> virtual <b>earnings</b> per start: LAEV/S) and a normalized ranking (PERF). The phenotypic correlations between these traits were calculated, in order to deduce what is common and what is specific to each measure. The environment factors that were investigated are age (3 to 8 years and older), sex (male or female), year of race (1995 to 2007) and the interactions between these factors. The General Linear Model (GLM) procedure from SAS software was used to identify and quantify the non-genetic factors affecting racing performances. The results showed significantly high positive correlations (p< 0. 001) between the three traits, hence considered as accounting for similar aptitudes. The effects of age (with a plateau between 4 and 5 years) and year (with an increasing trend for more recent years) {{turned out to be}} significant (p< 0. 001) for the three traits, the sex effect was only significant for the PERF trait (with better performances for males than females) and an interaction between the age and year of the performance was the only significant interaction (p< 0. 05) for the LAEV trait.

40|$|Selective {{breeding}} of Arabian horses in Algeria {{is not yet}} well developped. No accurate estimation of the breeding values of racing horses is carried out untill now. The estimation is based on one or several measurable traits, linked to race performance. To allow for an accurate estimation, {{it is important to}} determine the part of the phenotypic variability that is due to non-genetic factors (environmental). This first study estimates phenotypic correlations between the recorded traits in order to deduce to what extent the different measures bring different information on animal performance. Then it estimates the influence on performance of non-genetic factors such as sex, age, year of performance and the interactions between these various factors. From 1995 to 2007, the data related to flat racing was collected. The General Linear Model was used to identify and quantify the non-genetic factors affecting racing performances. Three traits were used: two earnings traits (the logarithm of annual virtual earnings: LAEV and the logarithm of <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> virtual <b>earnings</b> per start: LAEV/S), and one ranking trait (the ranking transformed and normalised: PERF). Significant high positive correlations was observed between the three traits (p< 0. 001), which thus give account of similar informative aptitudes. The effects of sex, age, year as well as the interactions between age and sex and between age and year turned out to be significant for the three traits (p< 0. 05).
