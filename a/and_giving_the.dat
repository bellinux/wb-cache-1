5|$|Apple {{approached}} Sony in late 1989 {{because it}} did not have enough engineers to handle the number of new products that were planned for delivery in 1991. Using a basic blueprint from Apple, including a list of chips and other components, and the Portable's architecture, the 100 was miniaturized and manufactured by Sony in San Diego, California, and Japan. Sony engineers had little experience building personal computers but nonetheless completed Apple's smallest and lightest machine in under 13months, cancelling other projects <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> PowerBook100 top priority. Sony president Norio Ohga gave project manager Kihey Yamamoto permission to recruit engineers from any Sony division.|$|E
5|$|Biffle led {{the field}} {{back up to}} speed at the restart, and was passed on lap 77 by Jeff Gordon. Three laps later, Sadler made a pit stop with a flat right rear tire. On lap 90 Kyle Busch took the lead, losing it to Gordon on the next lap. Earnhardt passed Gordon on lap 93, holding the lead for nine laps. Vickers took the lead on lap 102; Earnhardt's left front tire went flat the next lap, costing him a lap. Green-flag pit stops began on lap 107, with Vickers {{stopping}} on lap 108 <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> lead to McMurray. After the pit stops, Vickers regained the lead.|$|E
5|$|Chicago {{tight end}} John Gilmore picked up Vinatieri's {{bouncing}} kickoff {{and returned it}} 9-yards to his own 45-yard line, with an unnecessary roughness penalty on Mathis adding another 15yards <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> Bears a first down on the Colts' 40-yard line.

5|$|Kratos gains {{control of}} Danaus' head and uses its power against Alrik, who is {{torn apart by}} rocs.

Kratos then escapes and returns to Sparta with the Ambrosia, saving his daughter, <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> King of Sparta {{the rest of the}} elixir, who then officially awards Kratos the rank of Captain in the Spartan Army. Bitter at having lost the wager, Hades resurrects Alrik, who becomes King after his father dies and swears vengeance against Kratos.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette evaded Cornwallis' {{attempts}} to capture him in Richmond. In June 1781, Cornwallis received orders from London {{to proceed to}} the Chesapeake Bay and to oversee construction of a port, in preparation for an overland attack on Philadelphia.

5|$|Some {{animals are}} capable of {{autotomy}} (self-amputation), shedding {{one of their own}} appendages in a last-ditch attempt to elude a predator's grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. The lost body part may be regenerated later. Certain sea slugs discard stinging papillae; arthropods such as crabs can sacrifice a claw, which can be regrown over several successive moults; among vertebrates, many geckos and other lizards shed their tails when attacked: the tail goes on writhing for a while, distracting the predator, <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> lizard time to escape; a smaller tail slowly regrows.|$|E

5|$|Tensions {{between the}} factions were {{inflamed}} {{almost as soon}} as the 1924 legislature convened. A bill to outlaw parimutuel betting in the state passed the House of Representatives, but failed in the Senate. The next legislative battle centered on removing the head of the Board of Charities and Corrections and give the governor greater control over the board's makeup; this attempt also narrowly failed. When Senator Stanley, an opponent of prohibition, sought re-election to the Senate in 1924, Fields and his allies did not support him, leading to the election of Republican Frederick M. Sackett <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> Republicans both of the state's senate seats {{for the first time in}} history.|$|E
5|$|The {{score was}} still tied at one apiece {{in the bottom}} of the sixth, just as rain began to fall. Ruth lined a single past third baseman Les Bell. Meusel again sacrificed Ruth to second. Gehrig {{followed}} with a single, scoring Ruth <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> Yankees the lead. Lazzeri lined a shot to left but Gehrig, on a headfirst dive, was tagged out at third by Bell. Lazzeri advanced to second on the throw. Bell bobbled Dugan's grounder for an error to put runners at first and third, but Hank Severeid forced Dugan at second to end the inning. The Yankees maintained their one-run advantage through the end of the eighth inning.|$|E
5|$|The state's {{financial}} position was poor. Supporters of the dictatorship attempted to block progress on reforming the economy. The {{redistribution of wealth}} supported by the new government seemed {{a threat to the}} richest, in light of the recent Wall Street Crash and the onset of the Great Depression. The government attempted to tackle the dire poverty in rural areas by instituting an eight-hour day <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> security of tenure to farm workers. Landlords complained. The effectiveness of the reforms was dependent on the skill of the local governance, which was often badly lacking. Changes to the military were needed and education reform was another problem facing the Republic. The relationship between central government and the Basque and Catalan regions also needed to be decided.|$|E

5|$|Written by David Banks, {{the writer}} {{proposed}} the story {{around the time}} that he was engaged to play the Cyberleader in Attack of the Cybermen. The story is set in 2006, human scientists in Antarctica race to construct a device which will undo an imminent reversal of the Earth's magnetic field. However, the Cybermen are also present in Antarctica and are plotting to sabotage the device, giving them the opportunity to conquer the planet in the confusion caused by the reversal. The device is activated prematurely, crippling the Cybermen, <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> Doctor the opportunity to stop the Cyber forces. Banks later adapted the story as a novel for the Virgin New Adventures range in September 1993 featuring the Seventh Doctor.|$|E
5|$|Al-Badr {{had formed}} two royalist armies— one under his uncle Prince Hassan {{in the east}} and one under his own control in the west. Both armies {{controlled}} most of the north and east of Yemen, including the towns of Harib and Marib. The provincial capital of Northern Yemen, Sadah, which would have given the Imam a key strategic road towards the main capital San'a, was controlled by the republicans. There were also areas like the town of Hajjah, where the royalists controlled the mountains while the Egyptians and republicans controlled the town and fortress. Mercenaries from France, Belgium and England, who had fought in Rhodesia, Malaya, Indochina and Algeria, were sent to assist the Imam in planning, training <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> irregular forces the ability to communicate with one another and the Saudis. They trained tribesmen in the use of antitank weapons, such as the 106mm gun and in mining techniques. The numbers of mercenaries are estimated in the hundreds, although Egyptian sources at the time reported 15,000. Royalist tactics were confined to guerilla warfare, isolating conventional Egyptian and republican forces, and conducting attacks on supply lines.|$|E
5|$|Although the Giants were {{successful}} {{on the field}} in their initial seasons, they struggled financially. A key event in franchise history occurred in the 11th game of the Giants inaugural season. The Chicago Bears, led by star running back Red Grange, came to town attracting a then pro football record 73,000 fans, <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> Giants a much needed financial influx. The following year, Grange and his agent formed a rival league and stationed a competing team, led by Grange, in New York. Though the Giants lost $50,000 that season, the rival league folded and was subsumed into the NFL. After these initial struggles, the Giants financial status stabilized, and they {{led the league in}} attendance several times in the 1930s and 1940s. By the early 1960s, the Giants had firmly established themselves as one of the league's biggest attractions. However, rather than continue to receive their higher share of the league television revenue, the Mara sons pushed for equal sharing of revenue {{for the benefit of the}} entire league. Revenue sharing is still practiced in the NFL today, and is credited with strengthening the league.|$|E

5|$|Between levels, the Kid {{visits the}} Bastion, where the player can use fragments—the game's form of currency—that they have accrued to buy {{materials}} and upgrade weapons. With each core the player collects, they can add {{one of six}} structures to the Bastion, such as a shrine, an armory, or a distillery, and each shard allows the player to expand a structure. Each structure serves a different purpose; for example, the distillery lets the player select upgrades, and the shrine allows the player to choose idols of the gods to invoke, causing the enemies to become stronger <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> player increased experience points and currency. Experience points are {{used to determine the}} Kid's ability level; higher values give the player more health and increase the number of upgrades they can select.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Amanita species, A.bisporigera {{is thought to}} form {{mycorrhizal}} relationships with trees. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> tree greater access to soil nutrients. Fruit bodies of Amanita bisporigera are found on the ground growing either solitarily, scattered, or in groups in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests; they tend to appear during summer and early fall. The fruit bodies are commonly found near oak, but {{have been reported in}} birch-aspen areas in the west. It is most commonly found in eastern North America, and rare in western North America. It is widely distributed in Canada, and its range extends south to Mexico. The species has also been found in Colombia, where it may have been introduced from trees exported for use in pine plantations.|$|E
5|$|Sophia Alexandra Duleep Singh {{was born}} on 8August 1876, at Belgravia and lived in Suffolk. She was the third {{daughter}} of Maharaja Duleep Singh (the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire) and his first wife, Bamba Müller. Bamba {{was the daughter of}} Ludwig Müller, a German merchant banker of Todd Müller and Company, and Sofia, his mistress, who was of Abyssinian descent. The Maharaja and Bamba had ten children, of whom six survived. Singh combined Indian, European, and African ancestry with a British aristocratic upbringing. Her father had become famous for abdicating his kingdom to the British at age11 <b>and</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> Koh-i-Noor diamond to Queen Victoria. He was exiled from India by the British at age15 and moved to England, where Queen Victoria treated him kindly and provided his upkeep; his handsomeness and regal bearing made him her platonic lover. In London, Duleep Singh converted to Christianity. In later life, he reconverted to Sikhism and espoused the freedom movement in India when he realised that he had been deceived out of a large empire.|$|E
