Methods: Recruitment {{for the original}} sterilization procedure was from January 2008 to March 2009; subsequent confirmation test (hysterosalpingogram) capture was from March 2008 to July 2009. Patients were given a 10 cm visual analog pain scale during the hysteroscopic sterilization procedure, and took the scale with them as a take-home sheet. Following hysterosalpingography (HSG), patients received a follow-up phone call within 24 hours, {{and were asked to}} rate their pain during the hysterosalpingogram as well as during the first 2 hours following the test. Results: Eighty-nine hysteroscopic sterilizations were performed under local paracervical block and oral nonsteroidal medication. The median immediate post-sterilization visual analog pain score was 1. 9 (range 1. 7 – 2. 1, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 3 – 1. 5). Of the 89 sterilization procedures, 79 % (n = 70) patients underwent a confirmation test using HSG. Ten percent (n = 7) of the hysterosalpinograms were performed at least 3 months after sterilization (mean 17 [range 14 – 20] weeks). Median intratest visual analog pain score overall (n = 70) was 1. 8 (range 1. 6 – 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 5 – 1. 9). Following the test, the median visual analog pain score was 1. 7 (range 1. 6 – 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 4 – 0. 18). Of the 70 patients who participated in visual analog pain score capture, 64 had a paper copy of the scale had six had it via email. Of the 19 who did not complete hysterosalpinography, five were lost to follow-up. Reasons given by the remaining 14 for noncompliance with hysterosalpinography were: a busy schedule/childcare issues (62 %), fear of the test (13 %), trust in the sterilization procedure alone (13 %), and forgetting the appointment (12 %).

40|$|Abnormal {{expression}} of the alphaE-catenin protein, {{a component of the}} E-cadherin/catenin cell adhesion complex, is frequently observed in human cancer cells. An inverse correlation between alphaE-catenin expression and tumor malignancy can be of prognostic value. Mutations of the alphaE-catenin gene, CTNNA 1, were described in several human cancer cell lines and were found to result in aberrant cell adhesion. We have developed a polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism-based method for mutation analysis of this gene in human tumor DNA. This approach enabled us to identify several polymorphisms in a set of desmoid tumors, demonstrating that this method is suitable for alphaE-catenin mutational analysis. On the basis of our genomic characterization data, we found that the previously reported alternative splicing of the alphaE-catenin gene actually generates a frame-shift, resulting in a truncated alphaE-catenin protein. This finding is unlike the other alpha-catenin family members alphaN-catenin and vinculin, which show in-frame <b>alternative</b> <b>inserts.</b> Furthermore, real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis did not reveal relevant expression levels of this alternatively spliced alphaE-catenin variant neither in any human tissue or cell line tested, nor at any mouse developmental stage tested.

These in vitro models are grown on permeable two-chamber systems; however, commercially available, polymer-based cell culture inserts are around 10 [*]μm thick. Since the basement membrane found in biological systems is usually less than 1 [*]μm thick, the 10 -fold thickness of cell culture inserts is a major limitation in the establishment of realistic models. In this work, an <b>alternative</b> <b>insert,</b> accommodating an ultrathin ceramic membrane with a thickness of only 500 [*]nm (i. e., the Silicon nitride Microporous Permeable Insert [SIMPLI]-well), was produced and used to refine an established human alveolar barrier coculture model by both replacing the conventional inserts with the SIMPLI-well and completing it with endothelial cells. The structural–functional relationship of the model was evaluated, including the translocation of gold nanoparticles across the barrier, revealing a higher translocation if compared to corresponding polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membranes.

40|$|Heterogeneous nuclear {{ribonucleoprotein}} D 0 (hnRNP D 0) is an abundant, ubiquitous {{protein that}} binds RNA and DNA sequences specifically, {{and has been}} implicated in the transcriptional regulation of the human complement receptor 2 gene. We found that in vivo expression of hnRNP D 0 -GAL 4 fusion proteins increased the transcriptional activity of a GAL 4 -driven reporter gene, providing direct proof that hnRNP D 0 possesses a transactivator domain. We found, using truncated hnRNP D 0 proteins fused to GAL 4, that 29 amino acids in the N-terminal region are critical for transactivation. We established, using a series of recombinant truncated hnRNP D 0 proteins, that the tandem RNA-binding domains alone {{were not able to}} bind double-stranded DNA. Nevertheless, 24 additional amino acids of the C-terminus imparted sequence-specific DNA binding. Experiments using peptide-specific antisera supported the importance of the 24 -amino-acid region in DNA binding, and suggested the involvement of the 19 -amino-acid <b>alternative</b> <b>insert</b> which is present in isoforms B and D.
