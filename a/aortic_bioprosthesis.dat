40|$|BackgroundIt was {{hypothesized}} that native heart valves function {{as if they were}} simple tubes with sides that collapse when external pressure is applied. Because “form follows function,” this hypothesis could theoretically be confirmed by implanting a simple tube into the anatomic position of any native heart valve and documenting that under the same anatomic constraints and physiologic conditions as the native valve, the tube would assume the form of that native valve. If the hypothesis were thus proved, it would follow that a tissue valve based on a tubular design would have superior flow dynamics and stress distribution and would therefore be expected to outlast currently available tissue valves. Such a tubular tissue valve, the 3 F <b>Aortic</b> <b>Bioprosthesis</b> (3 F Therapeutics, Inc, Lake Forest, Calif) was designed and tested in vitro against a commercially available stentless <b>aortic</b> <b>bioprosthesis.</b> MethodsWith the use of state-of-the-art testing equipment, some of which had to be developed especially to test this truly stentless bioprosthesis in vitro, transvalvular gradients, effective orifice areas, degree of transvalvular laminar flow, finite element analysis of the distribution of leaflet stress, and accelerated wear testing for long-term durability were evaluated for the new 3 F <b>Aortic</b> <b>Bioprosthesis</b> in comparison with the St Jude Medical Toronto SPV <b>aortic</b> <b>bioprosthesis</b> (St Jude Medical, Inc, St Paul, Minn). ResultsThe valve gradients were lower and the effective orifice areas were greater for the 3 F <b>Aortic</b> <b>Bioprosthesis</b> at all valve sizes and under all test conditions, including cardiac outputs ranging from 2. 0 to 7. 0 L/min, mean perfusion pressures from 40 to 200 mm Hg, and aortic compliances of 4 % and 16 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVES The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate: (1) the clinical outcome of transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve (VIV) implantation according to Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC) - 2 criteria; and (2) to determine whether postprocedural transvalvular gradients differ in patients with bioprosthesis regurgitation or stenosis as primary mode of failure. BACKGROUND Transcatheter aortic VIV implantation has become a feasible option for selected high-risk patients with failed <b>aortic</b> surgical <b>bioprostheses.</b> METHODS Transcatheter <b>aortic</b> VIV implantation was performed in 14 high-risk individuals at the University of Zurich and University College London. RESULTS The prosthesis was successfully implanted in 13 patients (93 %). In 1 patient, a second transcatheter valve needed to be implanted due to valve malpositioning. Thirty-day all-cause mortality was 7 % (1 / 14). Prosthetic valve dysfunction according to VARC- 2 at 30 days was observed in 7 / 14 patients (50 %) due to an increased postprocedural transvalvular gradient > 20 mm Hg. Preprocedural transaortic gradients correlated significantly with postprocedural gradients (r= 0. 91; P<. 001). At 30 -day follow-up, postprocedural gradients were higher in patients with aortic stenosis as primary mode of failure as compared to those with aortic regurgitation (36 ± 6 mm Hg vs 16 ± 4 mm Hg; P=. 01). None of the patients exhibited prosthetic valve regurgitation of more than mild degree.

Three hundred thirty-nine consecutive patients with a Freestyle <b>aortic</b> <b>bioprosthesis</b> underwent an echocardiographic and Doppler examination according to a common protocol. Investigations were done within 4 weeks after operation, after 3 to 6 months, and after 1, 2, and 3 years. With a valve size from 19 to 27 mm, mean gradients decreased from 7. 9 +/- 5. 1 mm Hg at discharge to 5. 5 +/- 3. 8 mm Hg after 3 to 6 months (P <. 001). Thereafter, gradients remained stable. Effective orifice area 1 year after implantation was 1. 59 +/- 0. 58 cm(2) for the 21 -mm valves, 1. 92 +/- 0. 74 cm(2) for the 23 -mm valves, 2. 03 +/- 0. 64 cm(2) for the 25 -mm valves, and 2. 52 +/- 0. 72 cm(2) for the 27 -mm valves (P <. 001).

40|$|Two-dimensional {{echocardiography}} of Hancock porcine heterograft valves {{was evaluated}} by correlation with clinical, hemodynamic, angiographic and pathologic findings in 80 patients.

Increased size of a bioprosthetic leaflet image (minimal dimensions 3 x 5 mm) was observed in 46 % (19 of 41) of cases with primary tissue failure and in 62 % (10 of 16) of cases with leaflet vegetations due to endocarditis. Prolapse of leaflet echoes to below the level of the bioprosthetic sewing ring occurred in 76 % (28 of 37) of cases with torn leaflets and also in 46 % (6 of 13) of valves with vegetations on intact leaflets. Antegrade extension of leaflet echoes to beyond the level of the stents, observed in 4 of 16 cases with leaflet vegetations, was the only echocardiographic sign distinguishing leaflet infection from leaflet degeneration. <b>Aortic</b> <b>bioprostheses</b> with ring dehiscence affecting 40 to 90 % of the anular circumference showed motion discordant with the motion of the adjacent aortic root and native anulus.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the risks and benefits of short-term anticoagulation in patients receiving <b>aortic</b> valve <b>bioprostheses.</b> BackgroundPatients receiving <b>aortic</b> valve <b>bioprostheses</b> have an elevated early risk of thromboembolic events; however, the risks and benefits of short-term anticoagulation have been debated with limited evidence. MethodsOur cohort consisted of 25, 656 patients ≥ 65 years of age receiving <b>aortic</b> valve <b>bioprostheses</b> at 797 hospitals within the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (2004 to 2006). The associated 3 -month incidences of death or readmission for embolic (cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, and noncerebral arterial thromboembolism) or bleeding events were compared across discharge anticoagulation strategies with propensity methods. ResultsIn this cohort (median age, 77 years), the 3 most common discharge anticoagulation strategies included: aspirin-only (49 %), warfarin-only (12 %), and warfarin plus aspirin (23 %). Among those receiving aspirin-only, 3 -month adverse events were low (death, 3. 0 %; embolic events, 1. 0 %; bleeding events, 1. 0 %). Relative to aspirin-only, those treated with warfarin plus aspirin had a lower adjusted risk of death (relative risk [RR]: 0. 80, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 66 to 0. 96) and embolic event (RR: 0. 52, 95 % CI: 0. 35 to 0. 76) but a higher risk of bleeding (RR: 2. 80, 95 % CI: 2. 18 to 3. 60). Relative to aspirin-only, warfarin-only patients had a similar risk of death (RR: 1. 01, 95 % CI: 0. 80 to 1. 27), embolic events (RR: 0. 95, 95 % CI: 0. 61 to 1. 47), and bleeding (RR: 1. 23, 95 % CI: 0. 85 to 1. 79). These results were generally consistent across patient subgroups. ConclusionsDeath and embolic events were relatively rare in the first 3 months after bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{examined}} {{the influence of}} multiple valve-related parameters on the onset and incidence of valve degeneration in <b>aortic</b> <b>bioprostheses</b> through detailed echocardiographic follow-up. METHODS: In 648 patients (mean age, 73. 8 ± 4. 9 years) receiving an <b>aortic</b> valve <b>bioprosthesis,</b> long-term clinical (mean, 7. 5 ± 3. 2 years) and echocardiographic (mean, 6. 5 ± 3. 4 years) follow-up were performed. The occurrence of signs of structural valve degeneration (stenosis type and regurgitation type) was studied through multivariate analysis, including tissue origin, design and label size of the prosthesis, effective orifice area index (EOAi), patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM; EOAi < 0. 85 cm(2) /m(2)), and antimineralization treatment. RESULTS: Structural valve degeneration (SVD) was diagnosed in 12. 6 % of patients. In 7. 6 %, it was of the stenosis type (S-SVD); in 5 %, it was the regurgitation type (R-SVD). The absence of antimineralization treatment is an independent predictor of SVD, S-SVD, and R-SVD. Patient-prosthesis mismatch is an independent predictor of SVD and S-SVD, but not of R-SVD. Patients receiving a nontreated valve show a freedom of SVD at 10 years follow-up of 70. 1 ± 4. 3 % versus 90. 9 ± 3. 6 % in patients receiving a treated valve (P < . 0001). Patients having PPM and receiving a nontreated valve show a freedom of SVD at 10 years of follow-up of only 59. 8 ± 7. 0 % versus 88. 7 ± 3. 6 % in patients also having PPM but receiving a treated valve (P < . 0001). In patients not having PPM, the corresponding values were 78. 0 ± 4. 3 % and 92. 7 ± 3. 4 % for nontreated versus treated valves respectively (P = . 01).

We analyzed the clinical and pathologic data from 12 Carpentier-Edwards mitral bioprostheses removed from 12 patients because of severe dysfunction and showing detachment of the porcine aortic wall from the stent in one commissure or more. These 12 prostheses {{were part of a}} group of 92 such valves that were explanted and displayed structural deterioration. They belong to a population of 405 Carpentier-Edwards bioprostheses implanted in the mitral position in our institution between May 1978 and November 1988. The patients included three men and nine women with a mean age of 54 ± 13 years. One patient had a history of chronic renal failure, and two had systemic hypertension. Prosthesis sizes were 29, 31, and 33 mm (n = 4 for each size). The models of the valves were 6625 (n = 8) and 6650 (n = 4). Mean duration of implantation of the prostheses was 99 ± 27 months (52 to 136 months) and did not differ depending on the model. There was no significant clustering of commissural detachments depending on valve size, year of implantation, or gender of the patient. No similar phenomenon was observed among 76 explanted <b>aortic</b> Carpentier-Edwards <b>bioprostheses</b> with structural deterioration from a population of 441 valves implanted during the same time frame. Native porcine aortic roots (n = 5) and <b>aortic</b> Carpentier-Edwards <b>bioprostheses</b> explanted because of structural deterioration (n = 4) were used as controls for comparison. Macroscopic examination showed single commissural dehiscence in 10 patients and double in two. Radiology disclosed no or mild mineralization in eight valves and no calcium in the area of aortic wall dehiscence, except for heavily calcified valves. Light microscopy evidenced a significant thinning of the aortic wall at the paracommissural level of mitral bioprostheses (351 ± 68 μm) compared with either <b>aortic</b> <b>bioprostheses</b> (526 ± 59 μm; p < 0. 01) or control native porcine aortic roots (419 ± 50 μm; p < 0. 01). No difference was found in terms of aortic wall thickness between detached (322 ± 42 μm) and intact (366 ± 74 μm) commissures in mitral bioprostheses. It is concluded that the dehiscence of the aortic wall from the Dacron cover of the stent in the commissural area of Carpentier-Edwards bioprostheses in the mitral position is most likely produced by its weakening, as a consequence of excessive trimming with elimination of the outer layers of the aorta, during the manufacturing process. The reason this phenomenon appears in mitral bioprostheses and in a particular commissure seems to be linked to the areas of concentration of mechanical stress.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Left {{ventricular}} (LV) hypertrophy in {{aortic stenosis}} (AS) {{is considered a}} compensatory response helping maintain systolic function, but constitutes {{a risk factor for}} cardiac morbidity and mortality. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the degree of LV mass regression after sutureless implantation of the Perceval S <b>aortic</b> valve <b>bioprosthesis</b> (Sorin Group, Saluggia, Italy). METHODS: Between March 2010 and July 2012, 78 patients with symptomatic AS underwent isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) with the Perceval bioprosthesis.

40|$|Structural {{degeneration}} is {{an important}} long-term disadvantage of biologic prostheses. However, early failure of these prostheses is uncommon and is usually caused by rapid calcification. We report the successful management of a rare case of early failure of a stentless <b>aortic</b> <b>bioprosthesis</b> (within 4 months of implantation). The patient presented with severe noncalcific aortic regurgitation secondary to prolapse of the noncoronary leaflet. In consideration of the acute nature of failure in this new-generation bioprosthesis and its unclear cause, {{we believe that this}} report, albeit of a single case, warrants some attention...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundCurrent ESC {{guidelines}} require anticoagulation with VKA {{in patients}} with “valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) ”, which includes all types of prosthetic valve. We evaluated {{the value of the}} CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score for thromboembolism risk assessment in AF patients with biological valve replacement. Methods and resultsAmong 8962 patients with AF seen between 2000 and 2010, 8053 (90 %) had "non-valvular AF” and 909 (10 %) had valvular AF. Patients with valvular AF had a biological prosthesis in 59 % (n= 549), among which 77 % (n= 426) had a single aortic prosthesis and 64 % (n= 309) received a VKA. Patients with <b>aortic</b> <b>bioprosthesis</b> were older and had a higher CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score than those with a mitral prosthesis or a double valve replacement. During a follow up of 876 ± 1048 days, 681 stroke/thromboembolic events were recorded. The occurrence of events were similar {{in patients with}} bioprosthesis compared to the patients without prosthesis: (hazard ratio HR 1. 10, 95 % CI 0. 83 - 1. 45, p= 0. 52). Patients with <b>aortic</b> <b>bioprosthesis</b> tended to have a higher risk of embolic events vs other AF patients with bioprosthesis (HR 1. 73, 95 % CI 0. 87 - 3. 45), p= 0. 12). In multivariate analysis, older age and higher CHA 2 DS 2 -VASC score were the only predictors of embolic events whilst the presence of a bioprosthesis was not an independent predictor of events. The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASC score predicted the embolism risk in AF patients with a bioprosthesis (c-statistic 0. 55 95 % CI 0. 47 - 0. 63) but was less efficient than in “non-valvular” AF patient (c-statistic 0. 66, 95 % CI 0. 64 - 0. 67). ConclusionThis “real world” results support the use of oral anticoagulation in AF patients who have bioprosthetic heart valves. It also supports the use of CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scoring for the risk evaluation of AF patients with bioprostheses, albeit with reduced reliability. Patients with <b>aortic</b> <b>bioprosthesis</b> had a non significant higher risk of embolic events. A higher CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score in these patients is likely to explain these results...|$|E
40|$|This {{systematic}} review examined the clinical and hemodynamic {{performance of the}} stentless Freedom SOLO (Sorin Group, Milan, Italy) <b>aortic</b> <b>bioprosthesis.</b> The occurrence of postoperative thrombocytopenia was also analyzed. The Freedom SOLO is safe to use in everyday practice, with short cross-clamp times, and postoperative pacemaker implantation is notably lower. Valvular gradients are low and remain stable during short-term follow-up. Thrombocytopenia is more severe than in other aortic prostheses; however, this is without clinical consequences. Within a few years, the 15 -year follow-up of this bioprosthesis will be known, which will be key to evaluating its long-term durabilit...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Although stentless <b>aortic</b> <b>bioprostheses</b> are {{believed}} to offer improved outcomes, benefits remain unsubstantiated. The aim of our study was to compare stentless with stented bioprostheses, with regard to postoperative changes in left ventricular mass and hemody-namic performance, in the elderly patient. Methods: Forty patients with aortic stenoses, {{over the age of}} 75 years, were randomized to receive either the stented Perimount (n 20) or the stentless Prima Plus (n 20) bioprosthesis. Left ventricular mass regression, effective orifice area, ejection fraction and mean gradients were evaluated at discharge, 6 months and 1 year after surgery. Results: Overall a significant decrease in left ventricular mass was found 1 year postoperatively. However, {{there was no significant difference}} in the rate of left ventricular mass regression between the groups. Furthermore, 1 year postoperatively, the hemodynamic performance of the valves and the change in the ejection fraction did not differ between the groups. Conclusions: Our study shows that in a randomized cohort of elderly patients with aortic stenosis, we were not able to detect significant differences, with regard to hemodynamic performance and regression of left ventricular mass, between the stentless and stented valve groups. To our surprise, previously reported findings of non-randomized trials that showed faster and more complete regression of left ventricular mass and hemodynamic benefits of stentless valves were not reproducible...|$|R
40|$|Background—It {{is presumed}} that stentless <b>aortic</b> <b>bioprostheses</b> are hemodynamically {{superior}} to stented bioprostheses. A prospective randomized controlled trial was undertaken to compare stentless versus modern stented valves. Methods and Results—Patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (n 161) undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) were randomized intraoperatively to receive either the C-E Perimount stented bioprosthesis (n 81) or the Prima Plus stentless bioprosthesis (n 80). We assessed left ventricular mass (LVM) regression with transthoracic echocardiog-raphy (TTE) and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI). Transvalvular gradients were measured postoperatively by Doppler echocardiography to compare hemodynamic performance. There {{was no difference between}} groups with regard to age, symptom status, need for concomitant coronary artery bypass surgery, or baseline LVM. LVM regressed in both groups but with no significant difference between groups at 1 year. In a subset of 50 patients, MRI was also used to assess LVM regression, and again {{there was no significant difference}} between groups at 1 year. Hemodynamic performance of the 2 valves was similar with no difference in mean and peak systolic transvalvular gradients 1 year after surgery. In patients with reduced ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 60 %), there was a significantly greater improvement in LVEF from baseline to 1 year in stentless valve recipients. Conclusions—Both stented and stentless bioprostheses are associated with excellent clinical and hemodynamic outcomes 1 year after AVR. Comparable hemodynamics and LVM regression can be achieved using a second-generation stente...|$|R
40|$|Transcatheter valve-in-valve (VIV) {{implantation}} for degenerated <b>aortic</b> <b>bioprostheses</b> {{has emerged}} as a promising alternative to redo conventional aortic valve replacement (cAVR). However there are concerns surrounding the efficacy and safety of VIV. This systematic review aims to compare the outcomes and safety of transcatheter VIV implantation with redoes cAVR. Six databases were systematically searched. A total of 18 relevant studies (823 patients) were included. Pooled analysis demonstrated VIV achieved significant improvements in mean gradient (38 mmHg preoperatively to 15. 2 mmHg postoperatively, P< 0. 001) and peak gradient (59. 2 to 23. 2 mmHg, P= 0. 0003). These improvements were similar to the outcomes achieved by cAVR. The incidence of moderate paravalvular leaks (PVL) were significantly higher for VIV compared to cAVR (3. 3 % vs. 0. 4 %, P= 0. 022). In terms of morbidity, VIV had a significantly lower incidence of stroke and bleeding compared to redo cAVR (1. 9 % vs. 8. 8 %, P= 0. 002 & 6. 9 % vs. 9. 1 %, P= 0. 014, respectively). Perioperative mortality rates were similar for VIV (7. 9 %) and redo cAVR (6. 1 %, P= 0. 35). In conclusion, transcatheter VIV implantation achieves similar haemodynamic outcomes, with lower risk of strokes and bleeding but higher PVL rates compared to redo cAVR. Future randomized studies and prospective registries are essential to compare the effectiveness of transcatheter VIV with cAVR, and clarify the rates of PVLs. 11 page(s...|$|R
