40|$|This study delves {{into what}} causes {{convention}} <b>attendees</b> to perceive low or high multidimensional value (MDV) {{by examining the}} psychographic and demographic profiles of different tiers of MDV convention <b>attendees</b> (low-, middle-, and high-MDV <b>attendees</b> in this study). This study adopts functional, emotional, and social values to represent MDV. Using cluster and discriminant analyses, findings show that whereas low-MDV <b>attendees</b> negatively perceive convention experiences according to dimensions of the MDV, convention quality, and behavioral intentions, high-MDV <b>attendees</b> favorably evaluate convention experiences along the same dimensions. The demographic profile of high-MDV <b>attendees</b> includes more doctoral degree holders and academic faculty. Positive word of mouth, professional education, and social networking play more powerful roles than site-specific dimensions in discriminating low-, middle-, and high-MDV <b>attendees.</b> An understanding of the different tiers of MDV <b>attendees</b> enables convention planners to better comprehend distinct evaluative perceptions and, thus, to cultivate and sustain high MDV, resulting in loyalty and profit.

40|$|Background: World Stroke Day (WSD) is an {{international}} campaign for raising stroke awareness according to the WSD proclamation. We investigated whether the 2012 WSD campaign organized in Taiwan fulfilled {{the requirements of the}} target population and improved stroke literacy among the <b>attendees.</b> Method: A questionnaire survey regarding the 2012 WSD Taiwan campaign was administered by our trained interviewers to the <b>attendees.</b> Results: In total, 350 <b>attendees</b> participated in the survey, and only 57. 89 % of the <b>attendees</b> identified the brain as the main damaged organ in stroke. Most <b>attendees</b> recognized ischemic stroke (85. 94 %) as a stroke type and hypertension (47 %) as a common risk factor. The three most commonly recognized stroke symptoms were limb weakness, slurred speech, and facial weakness. Most <b>attendees</b> could seek medical help and call emergency services if a stroke occurred. Regarding the main themes, only 56. 16 % and 19. 76 % of the <b>attendees</b> knew about golden hours 123 and the FAST (Facial drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulties, Time) mnemonic, respectively, prior to the campaign. Furthermore, 50. 44 % of the <b>attendees</b> knew that thrombolytic therapy is the treatment of choice for stroke, and 58. 06 % and 40. 32 % of the <b>attendees</b> were partially and completely satisfied with the campaign, respectively. Only 20 <b>attendees</b> showed good stroke literacy. Conclusion: When preparing for future WSD campaigns, the organizing committee must perform a detailed assessment to understand target population requirements and design more appropriate events. For promoting the WSD campaigns, proficient advertising is necessary for attracting <b>attendees</b> and increasing their willingness to participate...|$|R

5|$|Wulfhelm was {{translated}} from the Bishopric of Wells to be Archbishop of Canterbury in about 926. While he was archbishop, he was a frequent <b>attendee</b> of the royal court, and King Æthelstan of England says in his law code that Wulfhelm was consulted on the drafting of the laws. Wulfhelm also advised the king on the Ordinance on Charities issued by Æthelstan. One of the surviving manuscripts of Æthelstan's laws has an epilogue that stated that the law was declared and decided at a synod held at Grately where Wulfhelm was present. From {{other parts of the}} laws issued by the king, it appears that Wulfhelm also presided at a council held at Thunderfield, at which the reeves of London pledged to keep the king's peace. The implication of the various accounts of the laws of Æthelstan is that Wulfhelm was highly involved in royal efforts to improve the law code.|$|E
5|$|In 836, Ceolnoth presided, with Wiglaf of Mercia, over {{a council}} held at Croft {{attended}} by the clergy {{of the southern}} part of Britain. This was the last time that the archbishop worked in concert with a Mercian king as, after this, he was an <b>attendee</b> at the Wessex royal court instead of the Mercian. In 838 a council was held at Kingston upon Thames where Ceolnoth made an alliance with the West Saxon kings Egbert and Æthelwulf. This agreement gave control of all of the free minsters under Canterbury's authority to the king in return for protection from Viking raids. Ceolnoth also ceded the right to influence the election of abbots within Kent to the king. In return, Egbert received the support of Ceolnoth for the succession of Egbert's son Æthelwulf as king. When Egbert died shortly after this, Æthelwulf succeeded his father and became the first son to follow his father as king of Wessex in almost two centuries. Ceolnoth also recovered control of some lands that had been lost by Canterbury. The end result of this agreement was that the Wessex kings became the secular protectors of the churches and monasteries of the archdiocese of Canterbury.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, the {{increase}} in research into the event industry is testimony {{to the importance of}} this industry to the burgeoning tourism economy. Despite a high level of interpersonal interactions among <b>attendees</b> at in-person events, a comprehensive review of related literature indicates a lack of theories explaining the process and rationale behind interpersonal interaction phenomenon at events. This dissertation promotes a deeper understanding of how interactions among <b>attendees</b> are subjectively experienced and has implications for the context of the most competitive segment of the business sector of events [...] conferences. ^ The empirical investigation of this dissertation includes a qualitative study and a quantitative study. The qualitative study was conducted to explore how <b>attendees</b> subjectively experience interpersonal encounters with other <b>attendees.</b> A total of 26 informants who have attended various association conferences {{in the past five years}} were invited to participate in an in-depth interview. Data analysis of these interviews leads to a flow of <b>attendees</b> 2 ̆ 7 subjective experiences at customer-customer encounters (CCEs), to instrumental-hedonic dual motivations that drive <b>attendees</b> to participate in CCEs, to three typical types of CCEs, and finally, to four major functions served by CCEs accompanied by four processes these functions are perceived to facilitate. These functions and processes propose a multidimensional conceptualization of <b>attendees</b> 2 ̆ 7 CCE experiences. This dissertation also identifies three levels of salient situational factors that affect <b>attendees</b> 2 ̆ 7 experiences at CCEs. Lastly, two special types of CCEs stood out, which are reported to stay 2 ̆ 2 sticky 2 ̆ 2 after <b>attendees</b> 2 ̆ 7 conference participation. ^ The quantitative study was administered to investigate the underlying mechanism through which <b>attendees</b> 2 ̆ 7 CCE experiences can impact <b>attendees</b> 2 ̆ 7 self-view and conference experience. Drawing upon Self Concept and Social Identity Theory, this dissertation proposes a positive relationship between <b>attendees</b> 2 ̆ 7 CCE experiences and their self-esteem as well as transcendent conference experience, which is mediated through <b>attendees</b> 2 ̆ 7 group identification with the conference group. <b>Attendees</b> 2 ̆ 7 CCE experiences are operationalized into know-how exchange and social-emotional support <b>attendees</b> received at CCEs. In total, 821 participants were recruited to fill out an online questionnaire regarding their interaction experiences at association conferences they attended in the past five years. Structural Equation Modeling results demonstrate that as expected, <b>attendees</b> 2 ̆ 7 CCE experiences positively affect their self-esteem and transcendent conference experience, which is partially mediated through <b>attendees</b> 2 ̆ 7 group identification with the conference group. In addition, the path coefficients indicate that compared with know-how exchange, the social-emotional support <b>attendees</b> obtain from other <b>attendees</b> at CCEs plays a more significant role in facilitating their identification process with the conference group and in leading to their transcendent conference experience. ^ This dissertation contributes to emerging consumer research on the influence of other consumers and consumer experience by exploring subjective experiences at CCEs in an interaction-driven industry [...] the conference industry. Drawing upon theories and empirical findings from a variety of study fields including social psychology, consumer behavior, organizational behavior, event management, and marketing 2 ̆ 6 branding, this dissertation develops a consumptive model of experiential CCEs in event tourism. This consumptive model reveals the 2 ̆ 2 black box 2 ̆ 2 in the behavioral process in consumer literature by uncovering the multidimensionality of CCE experiences and the impacts of CCE experiences on <b>attendees</b> 2 ̆ 7 self-view and conference experience. The consumptive model developed in this dissertation further advocates for and advances an integration of experiential focus in consumer behavior studies. The findings offered in this dissertation are also practically meaningful to the hospitality and event industry. Specific findings associated with <b>attendees</b> 2 ̆ 7 multidimensional interaction experiences at three major types of CCEs and the mediating role of <b>attendees</b> 2 ̆ 7 felt identification in <b>attendees</b> 2 ̆ 7 overall experiences provide hospitality and events practitioners with an enhanced understanding of <b>attendees</b> 2 ̆ 7 subjective experiences at CCEs. Such an enhanced understanding helps hospitality and events practitioners increase their competitive edge by strategizing best practices to engage <b>attendees</b> at CCEs, to add value to <b>attendees</b> 2 ̆ 7 overall experiences, and to enhance events-marketing with a focus on experiential CCEs. Hospitality and event practitioners are further offered strategic suggestions to collaborate with the host destination and the event venue in order to improve <b>attendees</b> 2 ̆ 7 interaction and event experiences and to sustain the development and success of the event industry. ...|$|R

5|$|After {{four minutes}} of deliberation, the jury's foreman {{announced}} a guilty verdict and {{a sentence of}} death. The trial lasted about one hour. Court officers approached Washington to escort him away, but were pushed aside by a surge of spectators, who seized Washington and dragged him outside. Washington initially fought back, biting one man, but was soon beaten. A chain was placed {{around his neck and}} he was dragged toward city hall by a growing mob; on the way downtown, he was stripped, stabbed, and repeatedly beaten with blunt objects. By the time he arrived at city hall, a group had prepared wood for a bonfire next to a tree in front of the building. Washington, semiconscious and covered in blood, was doused with oil, hung from the tree by a chain, and then lowered to the ground. Members of the crowd cut off his fingers, toes, and genitals. The fire was lit and Washington was repeatedly raised and lowered into the flames until he burned to death. German scholar Manfred Berg posits that the executioners attempted to keep him alive to increase his suffering. Washington attempted to climb the chain, but was unable to, owing to his lack of fingers. The fire was extinguished after two hours, allowing bystanders to collect souvenirs from the site of the lynching, including Washington's bones and links of the chain. One <b>attendee</b> kept part of Washington's genitalia; a group of children snapped the teeth out of Washington's head to sell as souvenirs. By the time that the fire was extinguished, parts of Washington's arms and legs had been burned off and his torso and head were charred. His body was removed from the tree and dragged behind a horse throughout the town. Washington's remains were transported to Robinson, where they were publicly displayed until a constable obtained the body late in the day and buried it.|$|E
