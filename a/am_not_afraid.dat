500|$|During the First World War Read {{served with}} the Green Howards, {{fighting}} in the trenches of France. He was awarded the Military Cross, promoted {{to the rank of}} lieutenant, and became [...] "obsessively determined not to betray his own men through cowardice". The novel's development of the [...] "clearly autobiographical hero" [...] of Olivero owes a great deal to Read's wartime experiences and the [...] "resolute self-possession" [...] they instilled in him. The irony of Olivero overthrowing a dictator only to become one himself is perhaps consistent with a view Read expressed in the mid-1930s: [...] "From certain points of view, therefore, I can welcome the notion of the totalitarian state, whether in its Fascist or Communist form. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> of the totalitarian state as an economic fact, an economic machine to facilitate the complex business of living in a community." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the gravity}} of Disraeli's condition, the doctors concocted optimistic bulletins, for public consumption. The Prime Minister, Gladstone, called several times to enquire about his rival's condition, and wrote in his diary, [...] "May the Almighty be near his pillow." [...] There was intense public {{interest}} in the former Prime Minister's struggles for life. [...] Disraeli had customarily taken the sacrament at Easter; when this day was observed on 17 April, there was discussion among {{his friends and family}} if he should be given the opportunity, but those against, fearing that he would lose hope, prevailed. On the morning of the following day, Easter Monday, he became incoherent, then comatose. Disraeli's last confirmed words before dying in the early morning of 19 April were [...] "I had rather live but I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> to die". The anniversary of Disraeli's death is now commemorated in the United Kingdom as Primrose Day.|$|E

[...] He received the last rites on May 12. Cooper died quietly the following day, Saturday, May 13, 1961, at 12:47 pm, six days after his sixtieth birthday.

In May 1974, after his family relocated to New York, Cooper's remains were exhumed and reburied in Sacred Hearts Cemetery in Southampton. His grave is marked by a three-ton boulder from a Montauk quarry.|$|E
500|$|Opinion swiftly {{turned against}} Blaine; the June 3 New York Times carried the {{headline}} [...] "Blaine's Nomination Now Out of the Question." [...] Blaine took {{his case to}} the House floor on June 5, theatrically proclaiming his innocence and calling the investigation a partisan attack by Southern Democrats, revenge for his exclusion of Jefferson Davis from the amnesty bill of the previous year. [...] He read selected passages from the letters aloud, saying [...] "Thank God Almighty, I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> to show them!" [...] Blaine even succeeded in extracting an apology from the committee chairman. [...] The political tide turned anew in Blaine's favor. [...] But now the pressure had begun to affect Blaine’s health, and he collapsed while leaving church services on June 14. [...] His opponents called the collapse a political stunt, with one Democratic newspaper reporting the event as [...] "Blaine Feigns a Faint." [...] Rumors of Blaine’s ill health combined {{with the lack of}} hard evidence against him garnered him sympathy among Republicans, and when the Republican convention began in Cincinnati later that month, he was again seen as the front-runner.|$|E

I am only afraid of the trend in our country today away from the principles of democracy." [...] Another wrote: [...] "the trial was a political trial... Does not the Soviet Union inspire fear {{in the world at}} large precisely because masses of human beings have no confidence in the justice of its criminal procedures against dissidents?... I trust that the Supreme Court will be able to correct a grave error in the operation of our political machinery by finding the... Smith bill unconstitutional." [...] William Z. Foster wrote: [...] "every democratic movement in the United States is menaced by this reactionary verdict... The Communist Party will not be dismayed by this scandalous verdict, which belies our whole national democratic traditions. It will carry the fight to the higher courts, to the broad masses of the people." [...] Vito Marcantonio of the American Labor Party wrote that the verdict was [...] "a sharp and instant challenge to the freedom of every American." [...] The ACLU issued a statement reiterating its opposition to the Smith Act, because it felt the act criminalized political advocacy.|$|E
