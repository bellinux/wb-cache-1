5|$|KRNKNN and KRBKNN — Friedrich Amelung had {{analyzed}} {{these two}} endgames in the 1900s. KRNKNN and KRBKNN are {{won for the}} strongest side in 78% and 95% of the cases, respectively. Stiller's DTC tablebase revealed several lengthy wins in these endgames. The longest win in KRBKNN has a DTC of 223 and a DTM of 238 moves (not shown). Even more <b>amazing</b> <b>is</b> the position at right, where White wins starting with 1. Ke6! Stiller reported the DTC as 243 moves, and the DTM was later found to be 262 moves.|$|E
2500|$|The Shadowrun {{world is}} cross-genre, {{incorporating}} {{elements of both}} cyberpunk and urban fantasy. Unlike in a purely cyberpunk game, in the Shadowrun world, magic exists and has [...] "worked" [...] since 2011. Among other things, this split humankind into subtypes, also known as metatypes/metahumans. Some of these metatypes {{take the form of}} common fantasy races. Likewise, some animals have turned into familiar monsters of past fantasy and lore and both monsters and human magicians have regained magical powers. By {{the second half of the}} 21st century, in the time the game is set, these events are accepted as commonplace. Man, machine, and magic exist in a world where the <b>amazing</b> <b>is</b> among the most common and technology has entered into every facet of human (and metahuman) life.|$|E
2500|$|Gomez {{revealed}} the artwork {{for the single}} on June 19, 2015. On it, she is seen striking a risqué pose, on a bar stool against a bare wall. The singer sports a natural look in the artwork; barefoot and wearing only an oversized, thin white T-shirt as she runs her hands through her hair. Jonathan Borge of InStyle opined that the cover art was enough to cause excitement on its own. Eric Diep from Complex said Gomez [...] "slays the cover artwork" [...] and felt it implied her upcoming album would substantiate her maturity as an artist. Idolator's Mike Wass opined that the artwork was a good look for Gomez which manifested maturity, and {{said that it was}} [...] "yet another indication that the next phase of her career will come as something of a shock to long-term fans". Laura Beck of Cosmopolitan called the cover art [...] "insanely sexy" [...] and [...] "gorgeous", and added: [...] "All this lady needs to look <b>amazing</b> <b>is</b> a T-shirt and a stool. Impressive". Wass, Corrine Heller of E! and Amanda Bell of MTV News all commended Gomez's sex appeal in the cover art, while other critics complimented the artwork's beauty and simplicity.|$|E

2500|$|On January 6, 2010, it was {{reported}} that the White House was considering two dates for Barack Obama's annual State of the Union address, which is typically on the last Tuesday of January at 9:00: January 26 and February 2. [...] Were the latter date selected, the Lost premiere would be preempted and have to air at a later date, sabotaging months of promotion by ABC for [...] "The Final Season" [...] and forcing some awkward rescheduling of the season, which had no leeway for interruptions. [...] This prompted an online protest among fans and the story was picked up by dozens of media outlets. [...] On January 8, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs announced [...] "I don't foresee a scenario in which millions of people who hope to finally get some conclusion with Lost are preempted by the president", to which Damon Lindelof responded via his Twitter account with [...] "OBAMA BACKED DOWN!!!! [...] Groundhog Day is OURS!!!!!!! [...] (God Bless America)". [...] Ben East of the United Arab Emirates The National newspaper summed up the story with [...] "confirmation of just how important [...] is came with an almost unbelievable communiqué from the White House last week … That's right. [...] Obama might have had vital information to impart upon the American people about health care, the war in Afghanistan, the financial crisis—things that, you know, might affect real lives. [...] But the most important thing was that his address didn't clash with a series in which a polar bear appears on a tropical island. [...] After extensive lobbying by the ABC network, the White House surrendered." [...] Lindelof later recounted, [...] "What's <b>amazing</b> <b>is</b> you realize how fickle your political affiliations are.

60|$|The {{transformation}} of Japan since 1867 is amazing, {{and people have}} been duly amazed by it. But what is still more <b>amazing</b> <b>is</b> that such an immense change in knowledge and in way of life should have brought so little change in religion and ethics, and that such change as it has brought in these matters {{should have been in}} a direction opposite to that which would have been naturally expected. Science is supposed to tend to rationalism; yet the spread of scientific knowledge in Japan has synchronized with a great intensification of Mikado-Worship, the most anachronistic feature in the Japanese civilization. For sociology, for social psychology, and for political theory, Japan is an extraordinarily interesting country. The synthesis of East and West which has been effected is of a most peculiar kind. There is far more of the East than appears on the surface; but there is everything of the West that tends to national efficiency. How far there is a genuine fusion of Eastern and Western elements may be doubted; the nervous excitability of the people suggests something strained and artificial in their way of life, but this may possibly be a merely temporary phenomenon.|$|E
60|$|Take my arm, gentle reader, {{and come}} with me into some street, perhaps trodden by your daily footsteps, but which now has such an aspect of half-familiar strangeness, that you suspect {{yourself}} to be walking abroad in a dream. True, there are some brick edifices which you remember from childhood, and which your father and grandfather remembered as well; but you are perplexed {{by the absence of}} many that were here only an hour or two since; and still more <b>amazing</b> <b>is</b> the presence of whole rows of wooden and plastered houses, projecting over the sidewalks, and bearing iron figures on their fronts, which prove them to have stood on the same sites above a century. Where have your eyes been that you never saw them before? Along the ghostly street,--for, at length, you conclude that all is unsubstantial, though it be so good a mockery of an antique town,--along the ghostly street, there are ghostly people too. Every gentleman has his three-cornered hat, either on his head or under his arm; and all wear wigs in infinite variety,--the Tie, the Brigadier, the Spencer, the Albemarle, the Major, the Ramillies, the grave Full-bottom, or the giddy Feather-top. Look at the elaborate lace-ruffles, and the square-skirted coats of gorgeous hues, bedizened with silver and gold! Make way for the phantom-ladies, whose hoops require such breadth of passage, as they pace majestically along, in silken gowns, blue, green, or yellow, brilliantly embroidered, and with small satin hats surmounting their powdered hair. Make way; for the whole spectral show will vanish, if your earthly garments brush against their robes. Now that the scene is brightest, and the whole street glitters with imaginary sunshine,--now hark to the bells of the Old South and the Old North, ringing out with a sudden and merry peal, while the cannon of Castle William thunder below the town, and those of the Diana frigate repeat the sound, and the Charlestown batteries reply with a nearer roar! You see the crowd toss up their hats in visionary joy. You hear of illuminations and fire-works, and of bonfires, built oil scaffolds, raised several stories above the ground, that are to blaze all night in King Street and on Beacon Hill. And here come the trumpets and kettle-drums, and the tramping hoofs of the Boston troop of horseguards, escorting the governor to King's Chapel, where he is to return solemn thanks for the surrender of Quebec. March on, thou shadowy troop! and vanish, ghostly crowd! and change again, old street! for those stirring times are gone.|$|E
