These concepts have been found useful in automatic speech recognition systems for speaker adaptation.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{dependence}} on earlier writers, Institutes was felt {{by many to}} be <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>voice,</b> and within a year there was demand for a second edition. This came in 1539, amplifying especially the treatment of the fall of man, of election, and of reprobation, {{as well as that of}} the authority of scripture. It showed also a more conciliatory temper toward Luther in the section on the Lord's Supper.|$|E

25|$|The public {{announcement}} {{system in}} all SMRT operated lines {{was introduced in}} 1994, beginning with the announcement of station names when a train arrives at the station.

25|$|The Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines {{was created}} in late 1999, {{providing}} MSF with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>voice</b> with which to bring awareness {{to the lack of}} effective treatments and vaccines available in developing countries. In 1999, the organisation also spoke out about the lack of humanitarian support in Kosovo and Chechnya, having set up field missions to help civilians affected by the respective political situations. Although MSF had worked in the Kosovo region since 1993, the onset of the Kosovo War prompted the movement {{of tens of thousands of}} refugees, and a decline in suitable living conditions. MSF provided shelter, water and health care to civilians affected by NATO’s strategic bombing campaigns.|$|E

500|$|On May 28, 1998, Phil Hartman, voice actor of Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz, {{was shot}} and killed by his wife while he slept in their Encino, Los Angeles, home. His wife, Brynn Omdahl, then {{committed}} suicide several hours later. In the weeks following his death, Hartman was celebrated in a wave of tributes. Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly opined that Hartman was [...] "the last person you'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper...a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with". After Hartman's death in 1998, rather than replace him with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>voice</b> actor, the production staff retired McClure and Hutz from the show. McClure last appeared in the season ten episode [...] "Bart the Mother", which was dedicated to Hartman.|$|E

Hartman was shot to death by his wife four months before the episode aired and it was dedicated to his memory. Rather than replacing Hartman with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>voice</b> actor, the production staff retired two of his recurring characters, Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz, from the show. However, Hutz and McClure still appear in various Simpsons comics, because a voice actor is not needed.|$|E
500|$|In late 2010, Square Enix {{announced}} a franchise reboot titled Tomb Raider; the new Lara Croft {{would be a}} darker, grittier reimagining of the character. In examining the character, Crystal Dynamics concluded that Croft's largest failing was her [...] "Teflon coating", and that it needed a more human version that players would care about. The studio sought <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>voice</b> actress, trialling dozens of relatively unknown performers. The second reboot focuses {{on the origin of}} the character, and as a result, changes the previous back story. Staff opted to first work on the character's biography rather than cosmetic aspects. Crystal Dynamics sought to avoid the embellished physique of past renditions and pushed for realistic proportions. In redesigning the character's appearance, the designers began with simple concepts and added features that it felt made Lara Croft iconic: a ponytail, [...] "M-shaped" [...] lips, and the spatial relationship between her eyes, mouth, and nose. The company also changed the character's wardrobe, focusing on what it believed was more functional and practical. In designing the outfits, staff aimed to create a look that was [...] "relevant" [...] and [...] "youthful", but not too [...] "trendy" [...] or [...] "hip". To gauge the redesign, Crystal Dynamics conducted eye tracking studies on subjects who viewed the new version and previous ones.|$|E

2500|$|Various poets have {{undertaken}} a [...] "revisionary mythopoesis" [...] {{in the long}} poem genre. [...] Since the genre has roots in forms that traditionally exclude poets who have minimal cultural authority, the long poem can be a [...] "fundamental re-vision," [...] and function as a discourse for those poets (Friedman). [...] These [...] "re-visions" [...] may include neglected characters, deflation of traditionally celebrated characters, and a general reworking of standards set by the literary tradition.
