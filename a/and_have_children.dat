5|$|As {{successful}} as Carroll was in business, however, {{he and his}} wife experienced many personal losses throughout this period. Of the ten children born to Charles and Mary Carroll, five died within a year of their birth. Henry, their eldest son, died the year before his father in 1719, at the age of 21 or 22. Only the third child, named Charles and later known as Charles Carroll of Annapolis, and their next son Daniel would marry <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>children</b> of their own.|$|E
5|$|The {{founder of}} the Hindu sect Pushtimarg – Vallabhacharya (1479–1531) is {{believed}} to have visited Pandharpur at least twice and was ordered to marry by Vithoba (called Vitthalnath or Vitthalnathji in the sect) <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>children</b> so that he could be born as Vallabhacharya's son. Later, Vallabhacharya married. His second son and successor was recognized as a manifestation of Vithoba and named Vitthalnath, also known as Gusainji.|$|E
5|$|During her grandfather's reign, Elizabeth {{was third}} {{in the line of}} {{succession}} to the throne, behind her uncle Edward, Prince of Wales, and her father, the Duke of York. Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as the Prince of Wales was still young. Many people believed that he would marry <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>children</b> of his own. When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second-in-line to the throne, after her father. Later that year, Edward abdicated, after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis. Consequently, Elizabeth's father became king, and she became heir presumptive. If her parents had had a later son, she would have lost her position as first-in-line, as her brother would have been heir apparent and above her in the line of succession.|$|E

When he proposed to Ellqvist, Bauer did so without the approval of his parents, who thought that he should be more established in a career and self-supporting before marriage.|$|E
5|$|Victoria's {{father was}} Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the fourth {{son of the}} reigning King of the United Kingdom, George III. Until 1817, Edward's niece, Princess Charlotte of Wales, was the only {{legitimate}} grandchild of George III. Her death in 1817 precipitated a succession crisis that brought pressure on the Duke of Kent and his unmarried brothers to marry <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>children.</b> In 1818 he married Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, a widowed German princess with two children—Carl (1804–1856) and Feodora (1807–1872)—by her first marriage to the Prince of Leiningen. Her brother Leopold was Princess Charlotte's widower. The Duke and Duchess of Kent's only child, Victoria, was born at 4.15a.m. on 24May 1819 at Kensington Palace in London.|$|E
5|$|Exponents of the universalist, anti-racist {{approach}} {{believe that}} the deities of Northern Europe can call anyone to their worship, regardless of ethnic background. This group rejects the folkish emphasis on race, believing that even if unintended, {{it can lead to}} the adoption of racist attitudes toward those of non-Northern European ancestry. Anti-racist practitioners such as Stephan Grundy have emphasized the fact that ancient Northern Europeans were known to marry <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>children</b> with members of other ethnic groups, and that in Norse mythology the Æsir also did the same with Vanir, Jötun, and humans, thus using such points to critique the racialist view. Universalists welcome practitioners of Heathenry who are not of Northern European ancestry; for instance, there are Jewish and African American members of the U.S.-based Troth, while many of its white members are married to spouses from different racial groups. While sometimes retaining the idea of Heathenry as an indigenous religion, proponents of this view have sometimes argued that Heathenry is indigenous to the land of Northern Europe, rather than indigenous to any specific race.|$|E

25|$|A {{third of}} intermarried couples provide their {{children}} with a Jewish upbringing, and doing so is more common among intermarried families raising their children in areas with high Jewish populations. The Boston area, for example, is exceptional in that an estimated 60% percent of children of intermarriages are being raised Jewish, meaning that intermarriage would actually be contributing to a net {{increase in the number}} of Jews. As well, some children raised through intermarriage rediscover and embrace their Jewish roots when they themselves marry <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sonnet 13 is {{included}} {{as one of}} Shakespeare's Procreation sonnets. Sonnets 1-17 are {{an introduction to the}} plot of the complete sonnets. Each of these 17 sonnets is a different argument to convince the young man to marry a woman <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>children</b> to continue his legacy and to have his beauty live on. In Sonnet 13, the poet uses his undying love for the young man as a motivator and as an encourager for the youth to marry a woman and eternalize his beauty by having children.|$|E

25|$|The church puts notable {{emphasis}} on the family, and the distinctive concept of a united family which lives and progresses forever {{is at the core}} of Latter-day Saint doctrine. Church members are encouraged to marry <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>children,</b> and as a result, Latter-day Saint families tend to be larger than average. All sexual activity outside of marriage is considered a serious sin. All homosexual activity is considered sinful and same-sex marriages are not performed or supported by the LDS Church. Latter-day Saint fathers who hold the priesthood typically name and bless their children shortly after birth to formally give the child a name and generate a church record for them.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Simple Kind of Life" [...] also discuss Stefani's {{relationship}} with Gavin Rossdale. She describes wanting to settle down, get married, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>children.</b> In the final verse, she even dreams {{about how her}} life would be {{if there were a}} mistake in her birth control and she became pregnant. However, she contrasts this with her commitment to music and No Doubt. Stefani describes her relationship as unhealthy because of this disparity, comparing herself to [...] "a sick domestic abuser looking for a fight." [...] She ultimately decides that settling down is just a fantasy for her since her freedom and independence is more important for her.|$|E

500|$|George's {{relationship}} with his eldest son and heir, Edward, deteriorated in these later years. George was disappointed in Edward's failure to settle down in life and appalled by his many affairs with married women. In contrast, {{he was fond of}} his second eldest son, Prince Albert (later GeorgeVI), and doted on his eldest granddaughter, Princess Elizabeth; he nicknamed her [...] "Lilibet", and she affectionately called him [...] "Grandpa England". In 1935, George said of his son Edward: [...] "After I am dead, the boy will ruin himself within 12 months", and of Albert and Elizabeth: [...] "I pray to God my eldest son will never marry <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>children,</b> and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne." ...|$|E

[...] Leaflets were distributed to passersby that described their reasons for picketing, surprising some recipients who were unaware gays and lesbians could be fired so easily, and disgusting others. Gittings remembered, [...] "It was risky and we were scared. Picketing was not a popular tactic at the time. And our cause seemed outlandish even to most gay people." [...] The evening prior to the group's picketing the State Department, Secretary of State Dean Rusk announced the pickets at a press conference. Gittings connected the high-profile visibility with a [...] "breakthrough into mainstream publicity." ...|$|E
