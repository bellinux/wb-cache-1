2500|$|The Data Book {{cemented}} Smith's {{reputation as}} a Napoleonic enthusiast, although not necessarily as a scholar. His first foray into narrative historical writing, 1813 Leipzig, met with mixed reviews. [...] On the one hand, Smith included interesting first-person narrative accounts of the four-day battle at Leipzig, and this was considered the main strength of his work. [...] On the other hand, however, the contextualising of the first-person accounts was less accurate, {{and in particular the}} first two chapters were marred by frequent factual errors. Filled with absorbing accounts of the battle and people's responses to it, Smith's book was considered <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>read</b> for students of military history, but not necessarily a scholarly contribution to Napoleonic studies.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new perspectives}} on the French liberal economist Jacques Rueff (1896 - 1978), especially as regards his early writings on unemployment. We aim to show that Rueff distinguishes {{the root causes of}} permanent unemployment in England (1919 - 1931) based upon <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>reading</b> of non-Euclidean geometry. Controversially, this enables him to locate the cause of unemployment in the stickiness of the wage/price ratio. Hence, arguing that reality remains inaccessible in itself, Rueff focuses on a succession of variables (price, wage, unemployment), supplemented by his concepts of rational ego and the reasoning machine, in order to approach this reality...|$|R

40|$|Julia Kristeva’s {{work on the}} {{semiotic}} and {{the symbolic}} seems particularly relevant to Blake’s poem The Book of Urizen insofar as she is concerned with how we develop as speaking beings and how language both disguises and reveals evidence of a previous state of union with {{what she calls the}} maternal chora. These ideas allow for <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>reading</b> of Blake’s concern with the splitting off of Urizen from the Eternals and how this splitting off enables him to emerge as a signifying subject who bears traces of traumatic loss and upheaval, or of what Kristeva would term “the abject. ” Abjection is a key concept for Kristeva and plays an essential role in what she describes as the “melancholic imagination. ” Abjection in Urizen manifests as a sort of paranoid repression and repudiation of the drives, of mutability, multiplicity, the body, and the Other.
