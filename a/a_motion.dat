In {{this paper}} we propose <b>a</b> {{crystalline}} <b>motion</b> of spiral-shaped polygonal curves with <b>a</b> tip <b>motion</b> as <b>a</b> simple model of <b>a</b> step <b>motion</b> on <b>a</b> crystal surface under screw dislocation.

40|$|Let E be {{a closed}} {{set in the}} Riemann sphere C. We {{consider}} <b>a</b> holomorphic <b>motion</b> ϕ of E over a complex manifold M, that is, a holomorphic family of injections on E parametrized by M. It is known that if M is the unit disk Δ in the complex plane, then any holomorphic motion of E over Δ can be extended to <b>a</b> holomorphic <b>motion</b> of the Riemann sphere over Δ. In this paper, we consider conditions under which <b>a</b> holomorphic <b>motion</b> of E over a non-simply connected Riemann surface X can be extended to <b>a</b> holomorphic <b>motion</b> of C over X. Our main result shows that a topological condition, the triviality of the monodromy, gives a necessary and sufficient condition for <b>a</b> holomorphic <b>motion</b> of E over X to be extended to <b>a</b> holomorphic <b>motion</b> of C over X. We give topological and geometric conditions for <b>a</b> holomorphic <b>motion</b> over <b>a</b> Riemann surface to be extended.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} <b>an</b> {{implementation of}} <b>motion</b> optimization for robots. Functional optimization {{is converted to}} parameter optimization using B-splines. Many non-linear constraints are considered such as contacts stability, motors limitations and regularized collision avoidance. Semi-infinite constraints are simply solved by a fine enought discretization on a grid. Energy consumption is minimized. Motion optimization is solved with the IPOPT optimization package. For fast and reliable optimization convergence, gradients are computed. Joint friction is taken into account and regularized to obtain a smooth problem. Efficiency of the proposed software is demonstrated for three dynamic motions of the 30 degrees-of-freedom humanoid robot HRP- 2 : <b>a</b> kicking <b>motion,</b> <b>a</b> throwing <b>motion</b> and <b>a</b> lifting <b>motion...</b>|$|R
