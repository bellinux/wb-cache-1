5|$|A form of {{decorated}} classical <b>architecture</b> {{peculiar to}} Sicily {{had begun to}} evolve from the 1530s. Inspired by the ruined Greek <b>architecture</b> and by the Norman cathedrals on the island, this often incorporated Greek architectural motifs such as the Greek key pattern into late Norman <b>architecture</b> with Gothic features such as pointed arches and window apertures. The Sicilian Norman <b>architecture</b> incorporated some Byzantine elements seldom found in Norman <b>architecture</b> elsewhere, and like other Romanesque <b>architecture</b> it went on to incorporate Gothic features. This early ornate <b>architecture</b> {{differs from that of}} mainland Europe in not having evolved from Renaissance architecture; instead, it was developed from Norman styles. Renaissance <b>architecture</b> hardly touched Sicily; in the capital city of Palermo, the only remnant of the High Renaissance is the Fontana Pretoria, a water fountain originally made for Don Pietro di Toleda by Florentine artists Franscesco Cammilliani and Michelangelo Naccerino and brought to Sicily when it was already 20 years old (Illustration 5).|$|E

This paper {{reports the}} results of a {{comparison}} between a new class of <b>architectures,</b> called transport-triggered <b>architectures,</b> and traditional <b>architectures,</b> called operation-triggered <b>architectures.</b> It does this comparison by means of the MOVE-i 860, which is a transport-triggered approximation of the i 860.

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of 19th-century Romanticism, medieval virtues like chivalry became increasingly popular among the elites. Parallel to this, medieval <b>architecture,</b> primarily Gothic style, returned to public attention in Germany with the unfinished Cologne Cathedral, leading {{to the rise of}} Gothic Revival <b>architecture.</b> Other notable examples of this romantic infatuation with medieval structures and <b>architecture</b> are the Votive Cathedral of Vienna and Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria. This nostalgic longing for the medieval past, spurred on by the works of authors such as Hugh Walpole, Sir Walter Scott, and John Ruskin, meant that architectural had once again turned from the Classical to the Gothic style of <b>architecture.</b>|$|E
