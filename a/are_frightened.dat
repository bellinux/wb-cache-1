5|$|The authors {{discuss the}} broader concept of denial using social science theory, noting its {{occurrence}} appears in society when individuals <b>are</b> <b>frightened</b> or ashamed of their actions. They write that these motivations, when expanded {{from an individual}} to wider society, present themselves {{as a form of}} disease. The book identifies climate change denial itself as a pathology afflicting the culture of the planet. The authors lament that an inverse relationship exists between an increasing scientific consensus regarding climate change, and a simultaneous increase in denial within the greater public about the same issue.|$|E

500|$|A {{major theme}} {{of the film is}} change, and people's {{response}} to that change. Meyer considered Valeris and Chang [...] "frightened people, who <b>are</b> <b>frightened</b> of change", who cling to old ways despite the changing world. He hoped that the fictionalization of a current events story allowed for an objective look at the issues, rather than being blinded by personal bias. At the beginning of the film, Kirk operates under a similar bias, calling the Klingons [...] "animals" [...] and putting him at odds with Spock. The Vulcan sees the Gorkon peace initiative as logical, responding to the sudden change in the status quo in a collected manner; he even opens the peace dialog at the behest of his father.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Green had {{her film}} debut, when {{director}} Bernardo Bertolucci cast {{her for the}} role of Isabelle in The Dreamers (2003), which involved her in extensive full frontal nude scenes and graphic sex scenes. [...] Green told The Guardian that her agent and her parents begged her not to take the role, concerned that the film would cause her career to [...] "have the same destiny as Maria Schneider", because of Schneider's traumatic experience during the filming of Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris. Green said that with Bertolucci's guidance she felt comfortable during the filming of the nude and sex scenes but was embarrassed when her family saw the film. Her performance was well-received, and some compared her to Liv Tyler. Green expressed surprise when a minute was cut from the film for the American market, stating, [...] "here is so much violence, both on the streets and on the screen. They think nothing of it. Yet I think they <b>are</b> <b>frightened</b> by sex." [...] Her next film was Arsène Lupin (2004), in which she portrayed Lupin's love interest. She enjoyed the light-hearted role, although she has stated that she generally prefers more complex characters.|$|E

500|$|Sources {{including}} The Independent and Broadcast {{reported that}} several commentators had accused Channel 4 of making [...] "poverty porn". In response, Ralph Lee refuted those accusations during {{a debate on}} the 9 January edition of BBC Two's Newsnight programme: [...] "It’s inaccurate and it’s patronising towards the people that take part in these programmes and open up their lives, and it’s quite offensive {{to the people who}} make them." [...] Mirsky claimed the reaction to Benefits Street demonstrated how it had [...] "touched a nerve" [...] and subsequently proved it was [...] "essential" [...] the series was made. The boss of Love Productions, Richard McKerrow, also defended the series, saying it was not about [...] "demonising the poor...It’s a very honest and true portrayal of life in Britain and people <b>are</b> <b>frightened</b> of it." [...] Writing as the series concluded, The Daily Telegraphs Neil Midgley felt that Benefits Street had not exploited its participants, and was [...] "definitely the kind of series that Channel 4 should be making: easy to grasp and innovative, and yet a blinding revelation of some ills that {{are at the heart of}} modern Britain." [...] Midgley's view was echoed by Jay Hunt, Channel 4's chief creative officer, who described the series as [...] "a perfect Channel 4 show [...] It engaged a huge audience and got millions of people thinking about the welfare state and people at the bottom of society." ...|$|E

2500|$|Erik, {{the main}} character, is not listed {{as having a}} last name. Erik was born in 1831 in Boscherville, France, and lived until 1881, where {{he died in the}} catacombs beneath the Opera Garnier, where he had lived in what is {{referred}} to as [...] "The House on the Lake," [...] the lake being, in this case, Lake Averne. Erik {{is said to have been}} unspeakably ugly, with sunken mismatched eyes that were not unlike a cat's, incredibly gaunt features, and no nose. Kay keeps to Leroux's original description, depicting Erik as having [...] "sunken, mismatched eyes and grossly malformed lips, a horrible gaping hole where the nose should have been." [...] Erik is also skeletally thin, tall, and with abnormally long fingers which are possessed of an inhuman dexterity. He wears a full-mask at nearly all times, along with expensively tailored clothes and gloves, to hide his frightening appearance. He is also cold to the touch. He seems to have little or no sexual experience or outlet; most women <b>are</b> <b>frightened</b> or disgusted by his appearance, sometimes with fatal results (see description of Luciana below), and he was nearly raped as a young boy. Kay's Erik suffers from violent mood swings and depression, and over the course of the book, through various tragedies and a morphine addiction, he slowly loses what sanity he possessed.|$|E
2500|$|Nick Cotton was the twenty-fourth {{character}} {{invented by}} {{the creators of}} EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Nick {{was not part of}} Holland's and Smith's original vision for EastEnders, and his creation came about as an afterthought. The first episode of the series was to include the death of an elderly resident, Reg Cox, who had been brutally attacked in his home, and left to die. During the first writers' meeting, where the writers were introduced to the intended characters and early scripts, each independently wanted to know which character had killed Reg. However, Holland and Smith had never intended for the murderer to be unveiled. They had no idea who had killed Reg Cox, and they had felt that [...] "the who" [...] was not important. The fact that he was dead following an attack was the important issue, and Reg's murder was not intended to be solved, it was only there to tell the audience, from the outset, that Walford was a rough and tough place. The writers opposed this. They accused Holland of throwing away a great opportunity and suggested that a murder hunt would provide an array of dramatic possibilities that would captivate the audience. After deciding that all of the twenty-three original characters were incapable of committing the crime, Holland decided to invent an entirely new character, in the form of Nick Cotton. The original character outline for Nick read: [...] "His image is exclusively macho. Vanishes for weeks on end. Mum doesn't ask questions... Unlike Den, Nick is a real crook. Worms his way into people's confidentiality and homes. From then on, lives on his wits. Waiting for the moment to strike; to nick the cash and disappear...Usually chooses his victims who, for one reason or another, <b>are</b> <b>frightened</b> to report him...Nick's a heroin addict." [...] As Nick was only intended to be a semi-regular character, Julia Smith was not involved in his casting and the actor John Altman was chosen by the directors. However she requested he was axed, after he refused to portray Nick having a gay relationship with Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt) because he thought it was out of character.|$|E
