25|$|The {{truth about}} Dumbledore's death is {{revealed}} through Snape's last memories in the Pensieve. Harry learns that Dumbledore {{made a terrible}} error by placing a cursed ring on his right hand, sometime between the fifth and sixth book, forgetting the curses that must be on the ring. The ring held the Resurrection Stone, which Dumbledore hoped to use {{to allow him to}} apologise to his sister and parents. Dumbledore called Snape to help him; however, when Snape arrived and assessed the curse, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> contain it. Snape told Dumbledore that he had {{little more than a year}} to live. After hearing this news, Dumbledore revealed to Snape that he knew about Voldemort's plan to have Draco kill him. He asked Snape to use the Killing Curse on him when the time came because he did not want Draco to have to kill him, saying that the boy's soul was still intact; Draco's soul would have been damaged in killing Dumbledore out of malice, whereas Snape was fully aware that he would be merely sparing Dumbledore pain and humiliation. He also intended for Snape to be the one to kill him and for the Elder Wand to be buried with him, in order to prevent the wand from being passed on again.|$|E
2500|$|The same year, Raffles {{appointed}} John Crawfurd as Resident of Singapore. Crawfurd {{doubted the}} legitimacy of the judicial system set up by Raffles, and annulled proceedings in which magistrates had ordered the flogging of gamblers and the seizure of their properties. He eventually abolished the magistracy, replacing it with a Court of Requests overseen by an Assistant Resident which dealt with minor civil cases, and a Resident's Court hearing all other cases which he himself presided over. Crawfurd had no authoritative guide to the applicable law, so he decided cases on [...] "general principles of English law", taking into account so far as he could the [...] "character and manners of the different classes" [...] of local inhabitants. Unfortunately, Crawfurd's courts also lacked legal foundation, and he had no legal powers over Europeans in Singapore. Serious cases involving British subjects had to be referred to Calcutta; otherwise, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to banish them from the island.|$|E
2500|$|... "Mok-qua Bennette was {{his real}} name. On {{the way to}} Beaver Bay in 1870 he spied a bear (named Mok-qua) sunning itself under a large spruce. Because of weather {{conditions}} - three feet of snow - {{it was impossible for}} the bear to move fast. The bear looked like good meat to the Indian who, unfortunately, didn't have a gun with him. He took a ten foot stick and attached a butcher knife to it thinking he would stab the bear to death. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> tickle the bear. Seeing his method didn't work he cut a piece from a birch sapling with his tomahawk and tried to kill the bear by clubbing him to death. After the first blow he fell back while drawing away and got tangled in the limbs of the fallen tree. Mok-qua attacked the Indian, clawing his shoulder and arms. He did not bite him. The bear left the Indian who was unconscious. The Indian regained consciousness at night and when he did he was very sick and almost frozen. He somehow dragged himself to the farm of Jacob Hangarner who, after warming and feeding him, brough him to Beaver Bay. The Indian suffered more from exposure than from the attack." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, Dick has {{the only}} map we possess." [...] And Tom grinned, while Sam had <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{to keep from}} {{laughing}} outright.|$|R
60|$|The sleigh {{driver had}} {{returned}} with the runaway horse. The animal was highly excited and the driver had <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to quiet the steed.|$|R
60|$|Poor Sam {{could not}} speak, for a wave had struck him {{full in the}} mouth, and <b>he</b> had <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{to keep from being}} washed overboard.|$|R
2500|$|Hook {{tries to}} comfort Emma by {{telling her that}} when his brother died <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> live in the moment. But Emma wonders how she can be still alive if Snow died. All of a sudden, a ladybug buzzes around Hook and just as {{he is about to}} kill the insect, Charming shouts “wait!” Charming takes the ladybug, places it on his hand and it is {{transformed}} back into Snow White by the Blue Fairy, thanks to a special form of fairy dust. The Blue Fairy is also aware that Emma wasn't Leia all along, but says it’s all right, her secrets can be hers. Snow is startled when Emma hugs her with tears in her eyes, shouting, “You’re alive.” Snow and Charming seem to be warming up to each other, causing a slight restoration in the timeline. Emma looks at the prisoner and suggests that she and Hook take her with them back to Storybrooke, but the woman is not happy about that idea, prompting Emma to knock her out to kidnap her. As Emma, Hook, and their additional guest go their separate ways, both Snow and Charming reach the troll bridge, but thanks to the altered timeline Snow doesn’t have her dust as a weapon to defeat the trolls, so she goes towards them and bluffs. They drop their weapons and take off. The timeline is back on track as Charming is now smitten with Snow before they go their separate ways, with Snow holding on to the ring and trying it on. [...] Emma watches from a distance and gets weepy. Hook says, “It’s ok, Swan. Not everyone gets a chance to watch their parents fall in love.” Emma opens the book, and discovers a picture of Snow and Charming getting married, and as expected Regina still seeking vengeance on Snow, resulting in the timeline being restored, only this time Regina turns the trolls into bugs with the dark magic and squashes them.|$|E
6000|$|He {{rolled his}} eyes round heavily, {{but he was too}} far gone to express surprise. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to utter one word, [...] "Brandy." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{thinking}} over {{it alone}} there in Feemy's sitting-room for an hour, he determined that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> {{to go back}} again to his only friend, Father John.|$|E
60|$|Nellie {{burst into}} tears, and Sam and Grace {{did their best}} to comfort her. Grace's own eyes were moist, and Sam had <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep from {{breaking}} down likewise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who are you?" [...] he demanded, in {{a muffled}} tone, for {{inside of the}} bag it was <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to breathe. The {{covering}} was so heavy <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not see a thing.|$|R
60|$|Jet rowed {{the boat}} a short {{distance}} out into the lake, and soon had <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to attend to his line, so rapidly did the finny denizens of the water attack the bait.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Rightbody {{looked at}} this flesh of his flesh, pretty and palpable flesh as it was; but, being confronted as equally with the brain of his brain, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to say meekly,-- ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{no longer}} possible, now he was alone, to move the larger logs, and <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to hew them into shape, without an attempt to remove the timbers {{to the site of}} the mill.|$|E
60|$|And adding {{example to}} his words, {{he began to}} run, dodging among the willows, and in marshy places leaping from tussock to tussock. He {{had no time to}} look for his direction; <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to turn his back upon the river, and put all his heart to running.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who saw {{anything}} of Lambert Brown?" [...] said another; [...] "I left him bogged below there at Gurtnascreenagh, and <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> the old grey horse wouldn't move a leg {{to get out}} for him." ...|$|R
60|$|The sailor {{was pulling}} up the stream, {{close to the}} shore, and the {{brothers}} could watch him with ease. The tide was running out and the oarsman had <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to make any headway.|$|R
60|$|The boat {{continued}} to toss and pitch, and now Dave had <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{to keep his}} feet. When he reached {{the entrance to the}} main deck he was stopped by one of the under officers.|$|R
60|$|After this, {{had it been}} possible, Bob {{would have}} hurried the work still faster along, but he had already urged matters on as fast as possible, and <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to insist on Ralph, Jim and Dick doing as much work {{as one of the}} laborers, he setting the example.|$|E
60|$|Between us we {{stretched}} the cub out, so that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> struggle and paw {{the air and}} utter strange cries. Hiram tied his rope to a tree, and then ran back to relieve me. It was high time. He took my rope and fastened it to a stout bush.|$|E
6000|$|The {{relief from}} the nervous strain under {{which he had been}} laboring for so long, left Smith-Oldwick {{suddenly}} as weak as a babe, so that he was forced to grasp the ape-man's arm for support--and when he found his voice <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to repeat: [...] "You? You? I thought you were dead!" ...|$|E
60|$|Upon this {{he went to}} get the Dog, {{which came}} running with signs of great delight; but the Prince was so much afraid of it that it was <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep from showing his alarm.|$|R
6000|$|... 'God Himself can {{do nothing}} here! It is done! And that is the end!' He turned his head; it was <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep from groaning. The old man's voice vibrated with earnest {{conviction}} as he spoke: ...|$|R
60|$|A fair breeze was blowing, and {{no sooner}} was the {{mainsail}} raised than the Fiver, moved off {{in such a}} lively fashion that Tom, who had lingered behind, had <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to run and get on board.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{little man}} of a doctor, {{with his head}} on one side,' said my aunt, 'Jellips, or {{whatever}} his name was, what was he about? <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> <b>was</b> to say to me, like a robin redbreast--as he is--"It's a boy." [...] A boy! Yah, the imbecility of the whole set of 'em!' ...|$|E
60|$|There was no {{satisfaction}} in this {{news for the}} heart of the good merchant, and {{when he returned to the}} brig and sought his niece's cabin he had no words with which to cheer her. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to tell her the little he had learned and to listen to her supplications.|$|E
6000|$|The foolish young WAS {{thinking}} {{how could a}} king so full of fiery words and strange oaths bear to make such an avowal respecting his own capital and his own courtiers. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to bow and reply, 'Nevertheless, Sire, at whatever risk, I cannot relinquish my wife; I would take her at one to the Ambassador's.' ...|$|E
60|$|Ferris {{stood beside}} Hal's body. Presently {{he thought he}} heard a low moan, and he {{imagined}} that Hal moved one arm. His teeth chattered worse than ever, and it was <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep from rushing away.|$|R
60|$|We'd a swore it if he'd been a dog; {{and so we}} done it. Well, he couldn't love us {{enough for}} it or be {{grateful}} enough, poor cuss; it was <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep from hugging us.|$|R
5000|$|Raffert was 60 when {{he became}} Executive Chef, and retired in October 1992 just before he turned 65. A confessed [...] "nibbler" [...] as he cooked, Raffert lost 20 lb after retiring. Frank Ruta, a Washington, D.C.-based chef who trained under Raffert at the White House, later said [...] "Hans was a guy that <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it <b>all.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it <b>all,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it <b>all</b> quickly, efficiently, neatly. He was just a walking {{encyclopedia}} of classical cooking." ...|$|R
6000|$|Peter didn't {{know what}} to make of it. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to gaze at Sticky-toes as if he thought Sticky-toes was a ghost. Just then the voice of Sammy Jay, or what sounded for all the world like Sammy's voice, screamed [...] "Thief! thief! thief!" [...] from the very spot where they had just heard the voice of Sticky-toes.|$|E
60|$|He {{was much}} displeased {{with his son}} for leaving her, {{especially}} when he saw how delicate and weak she still looked; and he was much annoyed at being unable to prevent it, without giving Arthur a premium for selfishness; so that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to treat her {{with a sort of}} compassionate affection, increased at each of her unselfish sayings.|$|E
60|$|The {{only thing}} for Whitefoot {{to do was}} to get just as far from that place as he could before Shadow should return. And so poor little Whitefoot started out on a journey that was to take him he knew not where. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to go and go and go until he could find a safe hiding-place.|$|E
60|$|Hour {{after hour}} went slowly by, and still Captain Moore did not return. What {{had become of}} his brother, Joe <b>could</b> not imagine. <b>He</b> feared the worst, and when morning came it was <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to keep back the tears.|$|R
60|$|Again he {{stumbled}} onward, into one passageway after another. Once {{the place was}} so narrow that he became fairly wedged fast and had <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to draw back. Then a sudden chill swept through his body, making his teeth chatter.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to {{keep himself}} from {{screaming}} out, for an agonizing pain shot through his forearm. He nearly fainted at the sudden shock of it; but he bit his lip and clenched his hands to hide his agony.|$|R
