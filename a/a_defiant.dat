5|$|Beginning in the Viking Age, {{personal}} names {{containing the}} theonym Thórr are recorded with great frequency. Prior to the Viking Age, no examples are recorded. Thórr-based names may have flourished during the Viking Age as <b>a</b> <b>defiant</b> response to attempts at Christianization, {{similar to the}} wide scale Viking Age practice of wearing Thor's hammer pendants.|$|E
5|$|England never seriously {{threatened}} {{to reach the}} victory target of 442 runs, which would have comfortably broken the world record for a fourth-innings run chase. Allan Lamb added to his reputation for mastering fast bowling with <b>a</b> <b>defiant</b> 113, but it was sizeable contributions from the tail and extras that took England to a respectable total of 307 – but a bad defeat by 134 runs.|$|E
5|$|Pittsburgh {{citizens}} {{helped to}} defuse the threat by banishing three men whose intercepted letters had given offense to the rebels, and by sending a delegation to Braddock's Field that expressed support for the gathering. Brackenridge prevailed upon the crowd to limit the protest to <b>a</b> <b>defiant</b> march through the town. In Pittsburgh, Major Kirkpatrick's barns were burned, but nothing else.|$|E

5|$|A further {{problem for}} the pair was Jackson's insistence on being around children. Though she never {{believed}} he was a pedophile—"I wouldn't have let him near my kids if I thought that"—she felt her husband was only opening himself up to more rumor and innuendo following the 1993 allegations. One evening at Neverland, Presley confronted the pop star on the issue and was met with <b>a</b> <b>defiant</b> Jackson, resulting in another argument. Upon being called selfish, the male musician pointed to his humanitarian endeavors. Presley countered that his philanthropy was irrelevant, that the issue was about them.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} summer came the Bodyline series, when England toured under Douglas Jardine and targeted the upper bodies of the Australian batsmen with short-pitched bowling, using a close leg side cordon to catch balls fended away from the body. In one of the tour matches before the Tests, Fingleton scored <b>a</b> <b>defiant</b> 119*, carrying his bat for New South Wales against the bumper barrage of Harold Larwood and Gubby Allen, ensuring his selection for the First Test. Despite his unbending resistance, his state fell to an innings defeat. In a warm-up for the Tests, he scored 29 and 53 not out for an Australian XI against the tourists, while most of his teammates struggled. His earlier experience held him in good stead as he scored 26 and 40 as Australia were crushed by ten wickets in the First Test in Sydney. Fingleton stood his ground and was hit several times. He then made <b>a</b> <b>defiant</b> four-hour innings to top-score with 83 in the first innings of Australia's only win of the series in the Second Test in Melbourne, although he did run out his batting partner Leo O'Brien in the process. This helped the Australians to reach 228 and they took a 59-run first innings lead before winning the match despite Fingleton making {{only one in the}} second innings. He appeared as well equipped as any Australian to combat England's strategy.|$|E
5|$|Returning to India, Pathan then {{represented}} {{his country}} {{at the highest level}} {{for the first time on}} home soil. Pathan continued to improve his batting with <b>a</b> <b>defiant</b> 31 and 55 against Australia in October 2004 in the First Test in Bangalore. This was his first half-century in Tests, and was scored after the specialist batsmen had failed. Nevertheless, he managed a total of only 2/100 and India fell to a 217-run loss. Pathan's career was put on hold after he suffered a side strain in the following Test in Chennai, in which he totalled 0/68, causing him to miss the Tests in Nagpur and Mumbai. Australia went on to take the series 2–1 and Pathan ended with two wickets at 84.00 and 100 runs at 33.33. After being overlooked for the First Test with selectors opting for three spinners, he returned in the Second Test against South Africa in Kolkata, aggregating 3/89 and scoring 24 in an eight-wicket win that sealed a 1–0 series win.|$|E

5|$|Voldemort triumphantly announces Harry's {{apparent}} {{death to}} everyone at Hogwarts, and demands {{that they all}} surrender. As Neville gives <b>a</b> <b>defiant</b> response and draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat, Harry reveals he is still alive, causing the Malfoys and many other Death Eaters to abandon Voldemort as they realize he failed to kill Harry again, and any hope of victory for the Dark Lord is now a lost cause. While Harry battles Voldemort throughout the castle, Neville kills Nagini with the sword, leaving Voldemort vulnerable, and Molly Weasley kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall. Harry and Voldemort's battle ends with Voldemort's own Killing Curse rebounding and killing him, once and for all. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that the Elder Wand had recognised him as its true master because he had disarmed Draco, who earlier had disarmed its previous owner — Dumbledore — but, instead of claiming the Elder Wand, Harry breaks and discards it.|$|E
5|$|Ba Cụt {{was born}} circa 1923 in Long Xuyên, a {{regional}} {{town in the}} Mekong Delta, in the far south of Vietnam. He was orphaned {{at an early age}} and adopted by a local peasant family. Ba Cụt was illiterate and was known from childhood as a temperamental and fiery person. The family's rice paddies were confiscated by a prominent landlord, the father of Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ. Ba Cụt's bitter personal experience imbued him with a permanent and fanatical hatred towards landowners. Thơ rose to become a leading politician in the 1950s and {{played a key role in}} Ba Cụt's eventual capture and execution. An aura of mystery surrounded Ba Cụt during his life, and foreign journalists incorrectly reported that he had severed his finger as part of a vow to defeat the French. As Ba Cụt became more fanatical in his religious beliefs and spent increasing time with local religious men, Ba Cụt's father demanded that he work more in the family's rice fields. <b>A</b> <b>defiant</b> Ba Cụt severed his index finger, which was necessary for work in the rice paddies.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc {{objected to}} the use of his troops in the attack on Royan in April 1945. As a result, only part of 2e DB was employed. The {{division}} rejoined Seventh Army, crossing the Rhine on 25 April, and joining the pursuit into Bavaria. Leclerc visited Dachau concentration camp after its liberation by the Americans. In an incident that took place 8 May 1945 at Bad Reichenhall in Bavaria, he was presented with <b>a</b> <b>defiant</b> group of captured Frenchmen of the SS Charlemagne Division. He asked them why they wore a German uniform, to which one of them replied by asking why Leclerc wore an American one. Leclerc told his men to get rid of them. That was taken as a death sentence. The group of French Waffen-SS men was summarily executed by the RMT without any form of military tribunal procedure, and their bodies left where they fell until an American burial team collected them. For his services leading the 2e DB, Leclerc was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour.|$|E

5|$|The Second Test in Bombay was {{the only}} time that Lindwall was to captain Australia in a Test match. Captain Johnson and his deputy Miller were both injured, leaving the bowling depleted. Ron Archer was injured and {{unavailable}} as Australia bowled first in extremely hot conditions. The situation worsened throughout the match as pacemen Alan Davidson and Pat Crawford were hindered by stomach bugs and hip strains respectively during the game. Leg spinner Richie Benaud could not bowl for part of the match after being affected by a fever and left arm orthodox spinner John Wilson pulled a muscle midway through his debut. This left Lindwall and batting all rounder Ken Mackay as the only fully fit bowling options. Australia bowled out India for 251, before a strong batting effort led by Neil Harvey and Jim Burke, both of whom made centuries, saw Australia make 7/523. Lindwall contributed a hard-hitting unbeaten 48 at the end. Australia's depleted bowling told in the home side's second innings, as the visitors were only able to prise out five wickets and match ended in a draw, with Indian captain Polly Umrigar batting for six hours for <b>a</b> <b>defiant</b> 78. Lindwall finished the tour with scores of eight and 28 in the Third Test in Madras. In a low scoring match in which all four innings finished under 190, Lindwall took match figures of 3/41 in a 94 run victory. It was a successful series for Lindwall, taking 12 wickets at 16.58 and scoring 92 runs at 30.66.|$|E
5|$|This was {{followed}} by a low scoring Second Test in Sydney when Australia were 4/77 needing 223 to win on a poor wicket against the lethal pace of Frank Tyson and Brian Statham. The express Tyson was bowling with the help of tailwind and the slips cordon were over 50m behind the bat. Harvey stood firm while Tyson scattered the stumps of his partners, and he farmed the strike ruthlessly, protecting the tailenders and counter-attacking the England fast bowlers, relying on the cut shot and clipping anything on his pads through the leg side. Schoolboys watching the game leaned over the fence to beckon the boundaries towards them. Last man Bill Johnston came in at 9/145 with 78 runs still required, but protected by Harvey he only had to face 16 balls in 40 minutes and they almost produced an unlikely Australian victory. Harvey continued to attack the bowling, and he hooked Tyson over fine leg's head for four. Together, Harvey and Johnston they had added 39 for the last wicket and halved the runs required. At this point, the Australian pair were confident. Harvey and Johnston felt that Tyson was about to run out of energy, and that their prospects would improve when Hutton would have been forced to change bowlers in the near future. However, it was not enough and England won by 38 runs when Johnston gloved a Tyson delivery down the leg side to the wicket-keeper. Harvey had played what many observers thought was the greatest innings of his life, <b>a</b> <b>defiant,</b> unbeaten 92, exactly half of the Australian innings of 184 in which no other batsmen reached 15.|$|E
