The reliability of the agar-gel immunodiffusion test was {{comparable to that of}} the microtitration serum-virus neutralization test commonly used in diagnostic laboratories. One advantage of the agar-gel immunodiffusion test was that severely hemolyzed and <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>serum</b> samples could be tested with confidence.

This <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>serum</b> activity {{correlated with the}} dose of ALP administered and was inhibited {{by the addition of}} a metabolizable lysophospholipid analogue. Human bone marrow cells and concanavalin A-stimulated lymphoblasts were affected to a much lesser degree, whereas cells of the erythroleukemia line K 562 appeared to be relatively resistant. When cells were cultured in postinfusion sera, the cytotoxicity of ALP in vitro was enhanced as much as fifteenfold when compared with the cytotoxicity of ALP when the cells were cultured in normal sera. No change in either relative or absolute distribution of phospholipids in postinfusion sera could be detected...|$|R
40|$|Serum from Mycobacterium bovis BCG-infected mice {{treated with}} {{lipopolysaccharide}} was cytotoxic to tumor cells in vitro. Serum-induced cytotoxicity was estimated by measuring release of [3 H]thymidine into culture supernatants of prelabeled tumor target cells. Serum from BCG-infected mice not treated with lipopolysaccharide or from uninfected mice treated with lipopolysaccharide was inactive. Moreover, although <b>serum</b> <b>cytotoxic</b> activity was evident with 10 syngeneic or allogeneic tumor cell lines, {{little or no}} effect was observed with normal embryonic fibroblast target cells. Maximal titers of <b>serum</b> <b>cytotoxic</b> activity were detected 14 days after BCG infection and 2 h after LPS treatment. Serum of BCT-infected, T-cell-deficient nude mice developed strong cytotoxic activity after LPS treatment; however, lipopolysaccharide-insensitive C 3 H/HeJ mice could produce this cytotoxic activity only after adoptive transfer with lipopolysaccharide-responsive C 3 H/HeN bone marrow. Physicochemical characterization of the <b>serum</b> <b>cytotoxic</b> activity revealed a heat-stable (56 degrees C, 30 min) entity with a molecular weight of about 60, 000 and an isoelectric point at pH 4. 8. Biological and physicochemical characteristics of this <b>serum</b> <b>cytotoxic</b> activity as defined by an in vitro assay were very similar to characteristics of tumor necrosis factor and suggest that this molecule may be a major effector mechanism for the antitumor actions of lipopolysaccharide...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{proposed}} mechanisms of vascular damage in connective tissue disease is the direct action of a <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>serum</b> factor inducing endothelial cell damage. The nature of this serum factor is unclear, but has been suggested to be a lipoprotein. Sera from patients with (1) systemic necrotising arteritis (polyarteritis nodosa, Wegener's granulomatosis, and necrotising arteritis associated with rheumatoid synovitis), (2) systemic or joint restricted rheumatoid disease, and (3) large vessel/giant cell arteritis have been examined for cytotoxicity to human cultured endothelial cells and azide-resistant ferroxidase-like activity (indicative of the oxidised lipoprotein content). Stored sera from patients with necrotising arteritis showed a significantly enhanced tendency to develop oxidised lipoprotein, which correlated closely with human endothelial cell cytotoxicity. Fresh sera also contained this factor, but to a lesser extent. It is argued that the cytotoxic factor detected in previous clinical studies is in part an in-vitro artefact, although its accelerated development in certain patient groups might suggest an excess of pro-oxidants that have developed in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Selye and his {{coworkers}} (I) have reported that the prolonged treatment of normal rats with massive doses of desoxycorticosterone acetate (DCA) and sodium chloride {{gives rise to the}} development of hypertension, nephrosclerosis, periarteritis, enlargement of the heart and kidneys, and other lesions. The degree of response, according to Selye, varies with a number of factors. Thus, an increase in the NaCI supplement of the diet, or preliminary excision of one kidney intensifies the changes described, as does the administration of anterior pitnimry extract or thyroid extract. On the other hand, Selye has shown that the concurrent administration of NI-I, C 1 with NaC 1 and DCA tends to inhibit the development of vascular and renal damage. Masson and Beland (2) state that KCI did not have this effect. Recent studies (3) concerning the effect of comparatively low dosages of certain adrenal steroids upon the course of <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>serum</b> nephritis in rats revealed that DCA (2. 5 rag. daily) intensified the nephritic process.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{number of}} cells capable of responding to Con A, PHA and LPS in the spleen, blood, lymph node and Peyer's patches of CBA mice has been quantified {{by means of a}} cytological analysis technique. No difference has been found between Con A- and PHA-responsive cells in spleen and lymph node. The lymphoid tissues of T cell-deprived mice have a reduced content of PHA responsive cells, but LPS responsiveness is within normal limits. Pretreatment of peripheral lymphocyte populations with high concentrations of anti-O antiserum and complement abolishes the response of the treated cells to PHA, but not to LPS, whereas similar treatment with a <b>cytotoxic</b> anti-immunoglobulin <b>serum,</b> which has no effect on PHA-responsive cells, only partially reduces the response to LPS.

40|$|Normal mouse peritoneal macrophages were {{rendered}} cytotoxic towards target {{cells in}} vitro by incubation with immune C 57 B 1 spleen cells taken early (7 days) and late (21 days) after a single injection of allogeneic DBA/ 2 lymphoma cells (L 5178 Y). This process, termed arming, {{was shown to}} be immunologically specific. X-irradiation of late immune spleen cells reduced their arming potential, but not that of early cells. Late immune spleen cells only were found to release spontaneously a factor which rendered macrophages weakly cytotoxic in vitro, and this release was not affected by irradiation. Both early and late immune spleen cells could be stimulated to release an arming factor by incubating them with irradiated lymphoma cells and this factor rendered macrophages strongly <b>cytotoxic.</b> Allo-immune <b>serum</b> also armed normal macrophages. Peritoneal macrophages harvested at 7 and 21 days from immunized mice were strongly cytotoxic towards the target cells. The results suggest pathways by which macrophages might become specifically cytotoxic in vivo and also integrated into the general immune response seen during rejection of the allogeneic L 5178 Y lymphoma...|$|R

40|$|Mouse peritoneal macrophages {{activated}} for tumor cytotoxicity by any {{of several}} in vivo or in vitro treatments released a soluble cytotoxin into culture fluids only after exposure to small amounts of bacterial lipopolysaccharides. This cytotoxic factor was physicochemically similar to the cytotoxic factor (tumor necrosis factor) in sera of BCG-infected mice injected with lipopolysaccharide. A rabbit antiserum against partially purified <b>serum</b> <b>cytotoxic</b> factor also inhibited the activity of macrophage-derived cytotoxic factor. Of special interest was the observation that rabbit anti-cytotoxic factor inhibited the cytotoxic activity of macrophages both in the presence {{and in the absence}} of exogenously added lipopolysaccharide. Inhibition was not complete but was consistent in all experiments. Thus, cytotoxic factor was implicated as a possible effector molecule in the nonspecific tumoricidal activity of activated macrophages...|$|R
40|$|Cells of {{osteogenic sarcoma}} line 791 T were treated in vitro with a {{selectively}} <b>cytotoxic</b> methotrexate-human <b>serum</b> albumin-monoclonal antibody conjugate at concentrations which were toxic but allowed the "escape" {{of a small}} number of tumour cell colonies (less than 0. 3 % compared with controls). These colonies were propagated as clones in order to test their expression of the monoclonal antibody (791 T / 36) -defined antigen and their resistance to methotrexate (MTX) by comparison with parental cells. Most of the conjugate-treated clones were incapable of prolonged growth and died out, in contrast to untreated 791 T clones which virtually always grow progressively. Only four treated clones grew at rates comparable with the parental line. Flow cytofluorometric analysis indicated that the surviving clones expressed normal or enhanced amounts of 791 T / 36 -defined antigen and clonogenic assays demonstrated that they were sensitive to cytotoxicity by MTX. As could be predicted from these results, further exposure to the conjugate inhibited growth of the clones at doses comparable with those active against parental 791 T cells. It is concluded that tumour cell clones emerging after exposure to a toxic concentration of a drug-antibody conjugate are not necessarily modified resistant clones, but may have severely impaired long-term growth potential or be susceptible to further contact with the same conjugate...|$|R
40|$|A spontaneously {{occurring}} antibody cytotoxic to dissociated {{cells of}} the neonate mouse cerebellum {{was found in the}} sera of some New Zealand (NZ) mice. No significant activity was found in the sera of six non-autoimmune mouse strains. The degree of cytotoxicity was similar towards both allogeneic and syngeneic cells. Absorption of the cytotoxic sera with brain and kidney homogenates removed the reactivity, while liver removed less reactivity. Absorptions with thymocytes and several other tissue homogenates and cells had no effect on the cytotoxicity levels, nor was there a correlation between the levels of thymocytotoxicity and cerebellar cell cytotoxicity. The antibody cytotoxic for cerebellar cells could not be demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of any mice examined, including a mouse with high <b>serum</b> <b>cytotoxic</b> levels.

40|$|Although dietary {{nucleotides}} {{have been}} determined to be required for normal immune function, there is limited direct interventional evidence confirming performance-enhancing effects of sublingual nucleotides in humans. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of sublingual nucleotides (50 mg/day) administered for 14 days in thirty young healthy physically active males, on endurance performance and immune responses. Fasting white blood cell count, natural killer cells (NKC) number, NKC <b>cytotoxic</b> activity, and <b>serum</b> immunoglobulin (IgA, IgM, IgG), and time to exhaustion, peak rate of perceived exertion, peak heart rate, and peak running speed during the exercise test were measured at baseline (day 0) and post-intervention (day 14). Time to exhaustion, as well as serum immunoglobulin A and NKC cytotoxic activity, were significantly higher at day 14 (p < 0. 05) in participants supplemented with nucleotides compared with those who consumed placebo. No significant differences in other parameters were observed between groups at post-intervention. No volunteers withdrew {{before the end of}} the study nor reported any vexatious side effects of supplementation. The results of the present study suggest that sublingual nucleotides may provide pertinent benefit as both an ergogenic and immunostimulatory additive in active males...|$|R
40|$|The {{benefit of}} class II major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) antigen matching to renal allograft survival, {{in the absence of}} immunosuppression, has been studied in partially inbred miniature swine. Permanent (greater than 6 mo) renal allograft survival was found in 30 % of recipients of either class II only or fully matched grafts. Analysis of the survival of the class II-only matched grafts by specific recipient/donor haplotype combinations indicated that survival was regulated by at least three genetic factors, including antigen gene dose, a class I MHC allele-dependent effect, and non-MHC-linked immune response phenomenon. Animals accepting class II-matched kidneys developed spontaneous tolerance to the graft, despite mounting an initial immune response marked by renal damage and the development of <b>serum</b> <b>cytotoxic</b> antibodies directed at the donor MHC antigens. The antibodies were only of the IgM class, suggesting that conversion of the humoral response to IgG was blocked. After acceptance of the kidney, three out of five animals showed specific prolongation of donor skin grafts. At the time of rejection of these skin grafts, no decrease in renal function nor reappearance of anti-donor antibodies was observed...|$|R
40|$|Intrahepatic {{cholestasis}} is {{a serious}} symptom of liver disorders with limited therapies. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of Huangqi decoction (HQD), a two-herb classic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), {{in the treatment of}} alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) -induced intrahepatic cholestasis in mice. HQD treatment ameliorated impaired hepatic function and tissue damage. A metabolomics study revealed that the endogenous metabolites significantly affected by HQD were related to bile acid (BA) biosynthesis and glutathione metabolism pathways. HQD treatment decreased the intrahepatic accumulation of <b>cytotoxic</b> BAs, normalized <b>serum</b> BA levels, and increased biliary and urinary BA excretion. Additionally, HQD restored the hepatic glutathione content and suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cholestatic mice. Protein and gene analysis revealed that HQD increased the expression of the hepatic metabolizing enzymes cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 2 B 10 and UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A 1 (UGT 1 A 1), as well as multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp 2), Mrp 3, and Mrp 4, which play crucial roles in BA homeostasis. Further, HQD increased the protein expression of glutamate-cysteine ligase, which is involved in the synthesis of glutathione. Importantly, HQD increased the nuclear expression of nuclear factor-E 2 -related factor- 2 (Nrf 2). In conclusion, HQD protects against intrahepatic cholestasis by reversing the disordered homeostasis of BAs and glutathione...|$|R
40|$|Homogenized {{tissue from}} the frontal cortex of normal human brains {{obtained}} at postmortem examination {{was used to}} absorb lymphocytotoxic antibody from the serum of six patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Four absorptions {{of all of the}} SLE sera with equal volumes of homogenized brain tissue at 4 degrees C depleted their cytotoxic capacity more than 90 %. Three of the six sera, however, retained some lymphocytotoxicity despite extensive brain absorption. Absorbed lymphocytotoxic antibodies were eluted from brain tissue absorbents at 37 degrees C. Cytotoxicity of the brain eluates was blocked by antibodies to human IgM (mu-chain specific) but not anti-IgG. The unabsorbed SLE sera, brain-absorbed sera, and brain eluates were equally cytotoxic to T (thymus-derived) and B (bone marrow-derived) cells fractionated from normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Thus, the lymphocytotoxic antibodies in SLE serum exhibit no preference for circulating human T cells. An analysis of the clinical records of 40 patients with SLE whose <b>serum</b> <b>cytotoxic</b> capacity had been determined revealed that circulating lymphocytotoxicity is greater in sera of patients with central nervous system (CNS) manifestations than in other SLE patients. This observation suggests a possible role for brain-reactive lymphocytotoxic antibodies in the development of CNS disease in SLE...|$|R

While {{it has been}} demonstrated that hemocyanin from some mollusks can induce potent immune response and is therefore undergoing clinical trials {{to be used in}} anti-tumor immunotherapy, little is currently known about how hemocyanin from arthropods affect tumors. In this study we investigated the anti-tumor activity of hemocyanin from Litopenaeus vannamei on Sarcoma- 180 (S 180) tumor-bearing mice model. Eight days treatment with 4 mg/kg bodyweight of hemocyanin significantly inhibited the growth of S 180 up to 49 % as compared to untreated. Similarly, histopathology analysis showed a significant decrease in tumor cell number and density in the tissues of treated mice. Moreover, there was a significant increase in immune organs index, lymphocyte proliferation, NK cell <b>cytotoxic</b> activity and <b>serum</b> TNF-α level, suggesting that hemocyanin could improve the immunity of the S 180 tumor-bearing mice. Additionally, there was a significant increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and a decrease in the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum and liver, which further suggest that hemocyanin improved the anti-oxidant ability of the S 180 tumor-bearing mice. Collectively, our data demonstrated that L. vannamei hemocyanin had a significant antitumor activity in mice...|$|R
40|$|Concomitant {{resistance}} (CR), {{the phenomenon}} by which tumor-bearing hosts {{are able to}} inhibit secondary implants of the same tumor at distant sites of the body, has been previously observed by us and others in different murine tumor models. Here, we verified the generation of CR in nude mice by tumors induced by SC inoculation of Calu- 6, a human lung carcinoma cell line. Histological analysis of secondary tumors subject to CR did not reveal macrophage infiltration nor <b>cytotoxic</b> signs. Although <b>serum</b> from tumor-bearing mice inhibited in vitro [3 H]thymidine uptake by Calu- 6 cells, {{no significant differences in}} [3 H]thymidine labeling index of tumors implanted in the right flank of mice with and without a primary tumor in the left flank were detected. In our model, the presence of a primary tumor hindered remote tumor angiogenesis, as well as serum from tumor-bearing mice inhibited in vitro proliferation of an endothelial cell line derived from a murine hemangioendothelioma. Conversely, an enhancement of the apoptotic index was observed in secondary tumor implants carried out in tumor-bearing mice. The results reported herein show that human tumor cells are capable of inducing CR, and that this phenomenon would be a consequence of an impaired neovascularization as well as an increased programmed cell death at sites distant from the primary tumor. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{determined}} {{the impact of}} a positive cytotoxic crossmatch on the outcome of liver transplantation. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Liver allografts rarely undergo hyperacute rejection, but transplants performed across a positive cytotoxic crossmatch tend to follow a different clinical course, with higher intraoperative blood use, postoperative graft dysfunction, and, in some cases, graft loss. How this affects overall graft survival has not been determined. METHODS: The authors provide a retrospective analysis of 1520 liver transplants performed between November 1989 and December 1993, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. All cases had a <b>cytotoxic</b> crossmatch using <b>serum</b> pretreated with dithiothreitol. RESULTS: There were 1390 negative crossmatch and 130 positive crossmatch cases. There was no difference in overall graft survival, although early survival rates were lower in the positive crossmatch group, with the maximum difference at 6 months: 0. 76 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 74 - 0. 78) for a negative crossmatch versus 0. 68 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 61 - 0. 77) for a positive crossmatch. These differences become negligible by the 2 -year mark. Using stepwise logistic regression, the authors identified seven variables independently associated with outcome: 1) donor age, 2) donor gender, 3) prior liver transplant, 4) medical urgency status, 5) ischemia time, 6) indication for transplantation, and 7) primary immunosuppressant. CONCLUSIONS: The cytotoxic crossmatch is not statistically associated with overall graft survival after liver transplantation. However, early failure rates are higher in the positive crossmatch cases, a difference that disappears by the second year...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCytotoxic and antitumors {{factors have}} been {{documented}} in the venom of snakes, while little information {{is available on the}} identification of cytotoxic products in the snake serum. In this study, we purified and characterized a new <b>cytotoxic</b> factor from <b>serum</b> of the non venomous Phyton sebae, endowed with antitumor activity. The serum of the P. sebae, termed PSS, exerted a cytotoxic activity and reduced dose dependently the viability of several different tumor cell lines. In a model of human squamous cell carcinoma xenograft (A 431), subcutaneous injection of PSS in proximity of the tumor mass reduced by 20 % tumor volume. Fractionation of PSS by ion-exchange chromatography yielded an active protein fraction, F 5, which significantly reduced tumor cell viability in vitro, and strikingly tumor growth in vivo. F 5 is composed of P 1 and P 2 subunits interacting in a 1 : 1 stoichiometric ratio to form a hetero-tetramer in equilibrium with a hexameric form, which retained the biological activity only when assembled. The two peptides share sequence similarity with type-γ phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) inhibitor (PLI-γ) from P. reticulatus, PIP, existing as a homo-hexamer. More importantly, while PIP inhibits the hydrolytic activity of PLA 2, the anti-PLA 2 function of F 5 is negligible. Using high resolution mass spectrometry, we covered 87 and 97 % sequence of P 1 and P 2. In conclusion, here we have identified and thoroughly characterized a novel protein displaying high sequence similarity with PLI-γ molecule and possessing remarkable cytotoxic and antitumor effects, that can be exploited for potential pharmacological applications...|$|R

40|$|The complex {{syndrome}} {{of cancer}} cachexia (CC) {{that occurs in}} 50 % to 80 % cancer patients {{has been identified as}} an independent predictor of shorter survival and increased risk of treatment failure and toxicity, contributing to the mortality and morbidity in this population. CC is a pathological state including a symptom cluster of loss of muscle (skeletal and visceral) and fat, manifested in the cardinal feature of emaciation, weakness affecting functional status, impaired immune system, and metabolic dysfunction. The most prominent feature of CC is its non-responsiveness to traditional treatment approaches; randomized clinical trials with appetite stimulants, 5 -HT 3 antagonists, nutrient supplementation, and Cox- 2 inhibitors all have failed to demonstrate success in reversing the metabolic abnormalities seen in CC. Interventions based on a clear understanding of the mechanism of CC, using validated markers relevant to the underlying metabolic abnormalities implicated in CC are much needed. Although the etiopathogenesis of CC is poorly understood, studies have proposed that NFkB is upregulated in CC, modulating immune and inflammatory responses induce the cellular breakdown of muscle, resulting in sarcopenia. Several recent laboratory studies have shown that n- 3 fatty acid may attenuate protein degradation, potentially by preventing NFkB accumulation in the nucleus, preventing the degradation of muscle proteins. However, clinical trials to date have produced mixed results potentially attributed to timing of interventions (end stage) and utilizing outcome markers such as weight which is confounded by hydration, <b>cytotoxic</b> therapies, and <b>serum</b> cytokines. We propose that selective targeting of proteasome activity with a standardized dose of omega- 3 -acid ethyl esters, administered to cancer patients diagnosed with early stage CC, in addition to a standard intervention with nutritionally adequate diet and appetite stimulants, will alter metabolic abnormalities by downregulating NFkB, preventing the breakdown of myofibrillar proteins and resulting in increasing serum protein markers, lean body mass, and functional status...|$|R
