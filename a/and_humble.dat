5|$|Bosh {{is noted}} for his leadership. When {{he was the}} leader of the Raptors, he was not known for being vocal on the court, preferring to {{maintain}} his quiet <b>and</b> <b>humble</b> demeanor but expecting his teammates to match his work ethic. However, Bosh was also known to deliver stern rebukes to teammates who make bad calls on the court. Throughout his career, comparisons have been made between him and Kevin Garnett due to their similar style of play and physique.|$|E
5|$|In February 1969, {{before the}} SS Manhattan had even sailed from its East Coast {{starting}} point, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), an unincorporated joint group created by ARCO, British Petroleum, <b>and</b> <b>Humble</b> Oil in October 1968, asked for {{permission from the}} United States Department of the Interior to begin geological and engineering studies of a proposed oil pipeline route from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, across Alaska. Even before the first feasibility studies began, the oil companies had chosen the approximate route of the pipeline. Permission was given, and teams of engineers began drilling core samples and surveying in Alaska.|$|E
5|$|In Jainism, God has no {{role to play}} in an individual's destiny; one's {{personal}} destiny is {{not seen}} as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment, but rather {{as a result of its}} own personal karma. A text from a volume of the ancient Jain canon, Bhagvati sūtra 8.9.9, links specific states of existence to specific karmas. Violent deeds, killing of creatures having five sense organs, eating fish, and so on, lead to rebirth in hell. Deception, fraud and falsehood leads to rebirth in the animal and vegetable world. Kindness, compassion <b>and</b> <b>humble</b> character result in human birth; while austerities and the making and keeping of vows leads to rebirth in heaven.|$|E

5|$|In his post-baseball career, Day {{worked as}} a {{bartender}} in Newark before returning to his hometown in Baltimore in 1970, where he held a position {{as a security guard}} until 1979. Before Day's death in 1995, there were numerous efforts to celebrate his career and induct Day into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, a long-time dream of his. One such effort was made by Mayor Kurt Schmoke who declared January 31, 1992, Leon Day's Day in Baltimore. Governor William Donald Schaefer made a similar proclamation for Annapolis later that same year on May 10. Day's discreet demeanor <b>and</b> <b>humble</b> personality often understated his several accomplishments, most likely leading to him being overlooked by the Baseball Hall of Fame's voting committee. After falling short one vote of being inducted in 1993, Day was elected to the Hall of Fame on March 7, 1995. Six days later, Day died of heart failure while in hospice at St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore; he was 78 years old.|$|E
5|$|It {{seemed to}} the besieged Christians as if arrows were {{shot out of}} the sky to strike <b>and</b> <b>humble</b> the pride of the infidels who rapidly died with marks on their bodies and lumps in their joints and several part, {{followed}} by putrid fever; all advice and help of the doctors being of no avail. Whereupon the Tartars, worn out by this pestilential disease, and falling on all sides as if thunderstruck, and seeing that they were perishing hopelessly, ordered the corpses to be placed upon their engines and thrown into the city of Kaffa. Accordingly were the bodies of the dead hurled over the walls, so that the Christians were not able to hide or protect themselves from this danger, although they carried away as many dead as possible and threw them into the sea. But soon the whole air became infected, and the water poisoned, and such a pestilence grew up that scarcely one out of a thousand was able to escape.|$|E
5|$|On 6 May 1680, Charles married Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark (1656–1693), {{daughter}} of King Frederick III of Denmark (1609–1670). He {{had previously been}} engaged to his cousin, Juliana of Hesse-Eschwege, but the engagement was broken after a scandal. Charles and Ulrika were engaged in 1675 {{in an attempt to}} smooth over longstanding hostilities, but the Scanian War soon broke out. During the war, Ulrika Eleonora gained a reputation for loyalty to her future home country by exhibiting kindness to Swedish prisoners: she pawned her jewelry, even her engagement ring, to care for the Swedish prisoners of war. Her personal merits and continued charitable acts throughout her tenure endeared her to the Swedish people and eased some of the difficulties brought on by her Danish background. In the peace negotiations between Sweden and Denmark in 1679, the marriage between her and Charles XI was on the agenda, and ratified on 26 September 1679. They married in Stockholm on May 6, 1680 in a hasty <b>and</b> <b>humble</b> ceremony.|$|E

5|$|Timber was {{the chief}} {{building}} material in Han architecture. It was used for grand palace halls, multi-story towers, multi-story residential halls, <b>and</b> <b>humble</b> abodes. However, due to wood's rapid decay over time and susceptibility to fire, the oldest wooden buildings found in China (i.e. several temple halls of Mount Wutai) date no earlier than the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). Architectural historian Robert L. Thorp describes the scarcity of Han-era archaeological remains, {{as well as the}} often unreliable Han-era literary and artistic sources used by historians for clues about non-existent Han architecture. What remains of Han-dynasty architecture are ruins of brick and rammed earth walls (including aboveground city walls and underground tomb walls), rammed earth platforms for terraced altars and halls, funerary stone or brick pillar-gates, and scattered ceramic roof tiles that once adorned timber halls. Sections of the Han-era rammed earth Great Wall still exist in Gansu province, along with the Han frontier ruins of thirty beacon towers and two fortified castles with crenellations. Han walls of frontier towns and forts in Inner Mongolia were typically constructed with stamped clay bricks instead of rammed earth.|$|E

25|$|In Sanskrit {{literature}} of Hinduism, {{the virtue of}} humility is explained with many terms, some of which use the root word, neti (sometimes spelled nati, nti, Sanskrit: नति). Related words include veniti (विनति), samniti (संनति, humility towards), and the concept amanitvam, listed as the first virtue in the Bhagwad Gita. Amanitvam is a fusion word for pridelessness and the virtue of humility. Other related concepts are namrata (नम्रता), which means modest <b>and</b> <b>humble</b> behavior.|$|E

But with the assassination of President Wade Hampton V in June 1922 by a Party stalwart, the Freedom Party suffers a sudden and near-total collapse as a political force.|$|E
