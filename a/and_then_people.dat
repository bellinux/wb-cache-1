25|$|Contrary to the mythology, {{the early}} {{moments of the}} March—getting there—was no picnic. People were afraid. We didn't know what we would meet. There was no precedent. Sitting across from me was a black preacher with a white collar. He was an AME preacher. We talked. Every now <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>people</b> on the bus sang 'Oh Freedom' and 'We Shall Overcome,' {{but for the most}} part there wasn't a whole bunch of singing. We were {{secretly}} praying that nothing violent happened.|$|E
500|$|This episode aired {{as part of}} Green Week, an {{initiative}} introduced by NBC's Chief Executive Jeff Zucker which included having every primetime program which aired between November 15 and November 22, 2009, contain some sort of positive environmental theme. Jack McBrayer, who plays NBC page Kenneth Parcell, {{in regards to the}} environmental theme, said [...] "It's something that is relatable and is something {{that a lot of people}} are doing. Everybody is on board with greening up the place and being more environmentally friendly in real life. Every now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>people</b> need to be reminded of things that can be done." [...] "Sun Tea" [...] was filmed on October 23 and November 10, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2017, {{following}} repeated criticisms from Donald Trump, Schwarzenegger {{announced that}} he would not return for another season on the show. Schwarzenegger reacted to Trump’s latest remarks on January 2017: “Hey, Donald, I have a great idea. Why don’t we switch jobs?” he asked in an Instagram clip. “You take over TV because you’re such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>people</b> can finally sleep comfortably again.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his latest}} conference, held in Malatya Association of Entrepreneurs, Dink {{claimed that the}} Kurds were now falling in for the traps that the Armenians fell in the past. He stated that [...] "English, Russian, German, and French are playing the same game again in this land. In the past, the Armenian people trusted them, thought they would rescue them from the cruelity of the Ottoman. But they were wrong, because they {{finished}} their business and they left. And they left brothers of this land as enemies". He claimed that the US is now playing the same game, and this time Kurds are falling for it. He said [...] "That is America. Comes, minds its own business, and when he is done, leaves. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>people</b> here, scuffle within themselves".|$|E
2500|$|... "Listen, {{other people}} will give you their {{versions}} of things, and I can't help that, but I myself am entitled to my own version, and I would say that I did {{the same amount of}} producing on this album as I've done on other albums, just never had my name [...] So, that was basically a really conscious decision for me, to be like, 'You know, I'm not doing anything different here than I have done in the past. Why shouldn't I be known to be doing it? You know, why shouldn't I get the credit for something that I'm actually doing?' So I just basically did it, and I didn't tell anybody, whereas the process before was, I would tell people that I was getting ready to do it, then we would gear up to do it, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>people</b> would get involved, and the credit would go wherever. So I just didn't tell a single soul I was doing it, I just did it in my own studio, and it was great." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Because {{you are not}} {{man enough}} I suppose," [...] said Wallace. [...] "You might be more manly, without being any older, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>people</b> would put more trust in you, {{and you would have}} a great many more pleasures." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not our {{own little}} ones,' said Jane; 'honest Phyl did not {{understand}} the joke, and Ada was thinking of her attitudes; one comfort is, that I shall be confirmed in three weeks' time, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>people</b> cannot treat me as a mere child--little as I am.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He gets indignant now <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> Virtuous <b>people</b> are {{generally}} content to resist temptation, but Wallace {{is apt to}} attack the tempter. I dare say it isn't wise, but that's {{the kind of man}} he is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I {{was told}} by {{a friend of mine}} the other day,--one of your great swells. He said I ought to belong to the Athenaeum, and he would propose me, and the {{committee}} would elect me as a matter of course. They rejected me and selected a bishop. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>people</b> are surprised that the Church is in danger!" ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was a lot}} of shouting, and one man {{was even}} jesting. The idea people seemed to have here was that the Martians were simply {{formidable}} human beings, who might attack and sack the town, to be certainly destroyed in the end.

6000|$|... "My dear, {{what you}} say, {{you say in}} joke; but a great many young women of the present day do, I really believe, {{go up to the}} altar and {{pronounce}} their marriage vows, with the simple idea that as soon as they have done so, they are to have their own way in everything. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>people</b> complain that young men won't marry! Who can wonder at it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{measure would}} not have so much infuriated the devout as did the {{introduction}} of [...] "black prelacy," [...] and the ejection of some 300 adored ministers, chiefly in the south-west, and [...] "the making of a desert first, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>peopling</b> it with owls and satyrs" [...] (the curates), as Archbishop Leighton described the action of 1663. There ensued the finings of all who would not attend the ministrations of [...] "owls and satyrs,"--a grievance which produced two rebellions (1666 and 1679) and a doctrine of anarchism, and was only worn down by eternal and cruel persecutions.|$|R
50|$|He later {{moved to}} video game company Accolade <b>and</b> <b>then</b> Picture <b>People</b> {{until it was}} sold to Hallmark Cards. Harris {{employed}} the entertainment retail strategy there, where photographers would wear spin hats and children could play with a giant camera.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} call a {{constitutional}} convention, {{a majority of the}} state legislators must vote in favor of holding a new convention, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the <b>people</b> of Wisconsin must approve the vote {{to call a}} convention at the next general election.|$|R
60|$|There he did {{get what}} for a time he held to be a point in his favour. The room was large and quiet at first, and he sat back restfully until it {{occurred}} to him that his attitude brought his extremely dusty boots too prominently into the light, so instead he sat up, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>people</b> of the upper and upper middle classes began to come and group themselves about him and have tea likewise, and so revive the class animosities of the previous day.|$|E
6000|$|That was all, but {{everyone}} was satisfied, and everyone fell a-crying, as if hope needed much salty water to strengthen it. That was soon over, however, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>people</b> went about smiling and saying to one another, with handshakes or embraces, [...] "He is better {{no doubt of}} it now!" [...] A general desire to rush away and assure themselves of the truth pervaded the family for some days, and nothing but awful threats from Mac, stern mandates from the doctor, and entreaties from Phebe not to undo her work kept Miss Plenty, Rose, and Aunt Jessie at home.|$|E
6000|$|Grace {{shook her}} head with a serious smile. [...] "Every one in their place, madam. I cannot help knowing that God {{has given me a}} gift: but why, I cannot tell. Certainly not for the same purpose as He gave it to you for,--a simple country girl like me. If He have any use for it, He will use it, as He does all His creatures, without my help. At all events it will not last long; a few years more, perhaps a few months, and it will be food for worms; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>people</b> will care as little about my looks as I care now. I wish, my lady, you would stop the gentleman!" ...|$|E
50|$|The People's Justice Party (PJP) was a {{political}} party in the United Kingdom from 1998 to 2006. It began in 1998 growing out of a protest movement Justice for Kashmir, which first {{gave rise to the}} Justice Party <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the <b>People's</b> Justice Party.|$|R

6000|$|Poor-laws are the {{inevitable}} accompaniments of an extensive commerce and a manufacturing system. In Scotland, they did without them, till Glasgow and Paisley became great manufacturing places, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>people</b> said, [...] "We must subscribe for the poor, or else {{we shall have}} poor-laws." [...] That is to say, they enacted for themselves a poor-law {{in order to avoid}} having a poor-law enacted for them. It is absurd to talk of Queen Elizabeth's act as creating the poor-laws of this country. The poor-rates are the consideration paid by, or on behalf of, capitalists for having labour at demand. It is the price, and nothing else. The hardship consists in the agricultural interest having to pay an undue proportion of the rates; for although, perhaps, in the end, the land becomes more valuable, yet, at the first, the landowners have to bear all the brunt. I think {{there ought to be a}} fixed revolving period for the equalization of rates.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. But do {{you really}} figure to {{yourself}} what a civil war may mean for the empire? Surely {{there are other things}} in the world besides this quarrel between the 'loyalists' of Ulster and the Liberal government; there are other interests in this big empire than party advantages? Yon think you are going to frighten this Home Rule government into some ridiculous sort of collapse that will bring in the Tories at the next election. Well, suppose you don't manage that. Suppose instead that you really do contrive to bring about a civil war. Very few people here or in Ireland want it--I was over there not a month ago--but when men have loaded guns in their hands they sometimes go off. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>people</b> see red. Few people realise what an incurable sore opens when fighting begins. Suppose part of the army revolts and we get some extraordinary and demoralising fighting over there. India watches these things. Bengal may imitate Ireland. At that distance rebellion and treason are rebellion and treason whether they are coloured orange or green. And then suppose the Germans see fit to attack us!" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{might have}} made himself easy, poor little man; Mr. Grimes did not turn into a water-baby, or {{anything}} like one at all. But he did not make himself easy; and a long time he was fearful lest he should meet Grimes suddenly in some deep pool. He could {{not know that the}} fairies had carried him away, and put him, where they put everything which falls into the water, exactly where it ought to be. But, do you know, what had happened to Mr. Grimes had such an effect on him that he never poached salmon any more. And it is quite certain that, when a man becomes a confirmed poacher, the only way to cure him is to put him under water for twenty-four hours, like Grimes. So when you grow to be a big man, do you behave as all honest fellows should; and never touch a fish or a head of game which belongs to another man without his express leave; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>people</b> will call you a gentleman, and treat you like one; and perhaps give you good sport: instead of hitting you into the river, or calling you a poaching snob.|$|E
