40|$|Abstract. Linked Data is {{an active}} {{research}} field currently; new ideas, concepts, and tools keep emerging in quick succession. In contrast, relatively little activity is being seen towards aspects like ease of use and <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools</b> for non-experts to promote Linked Data at SME level. This is a sign for the still developing maturity of said research field, {{and it is the}} motivation and starting point of the LinDA (“Linked DAta”) project. Concepts and components of an integrated framework of tools will be presented, where both Linked Data provision and consumption are covered. It will be shown how these tools can be combined and employed to carry out various activities, whose scopes range from single actions to holistic workflows. The usability of these workflows will be demonstrated along concrete pilot application scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Biomimetics, as the {{transfer}} of strategies from biology to technology, is an emerging research area and has led to significant concepts over the past decades. The development of such concepts is described {{by the process of}} biomimetics, encompassing several steps. In Practice, beneficiaries of the process face challenges. Therefore, to overcome challenges and to facilitate the steps, tools have been developed in various areas, such as engineering, computing and design. However, these tools are not widely used yet. This paper presents an overview and a classification study of more than 40 tools with qualitative criteria. The criteria included, for example, the year of development, the <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools,</b> the facilitated steps of the process or their contribution to sustainability. The classification shows that certain steps of the process and their challenges are well addressed by the tools, while other steps are not. The presented results contribute to the proposal of an improvement {{of the state of the}} art, and they build the foundation for future theoretical and practical analyses. These findings could contribute to increasing the implementation of biomimetics in various disciplines in the long term...|$|E
40|$|Software {{selection}} affects design outcome. Computer applications externalize {{in their}} graphical interface {{and in their}} internal logic a set of assumptions about how objects are constructed and space is represented. <b>Accessibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools</b> is in direct correlation with their rate of use. Depending on how user-friendly particular functions are, their use will appear with higher frequency than those foreign to the technological frames of the user groups for which software is designed. As each software is geared towards the needs of specific communities, it replicates in digital fashion those disciplinary practices already present in the analog world. However, modelling results are bracketed at its inception the very moment a particular 3 D package is chosen from a diverse array of digital offerings. If the application adopted is designed {{to appeal to the}} computer animation industry, the modelling results will bear the imprint of those organic qualities: buildings will appear character-like. Since computer programs have built-in slant meant to aid disciplinary specific users, they yield families of designs with formal commonalities. Unquestionably, proficiency of software use also broadens inventiveness of design. Nevertheless some applications make particular transformations harder to achieve, and as a result will be likely to exclude those modelling options from architectsi imaginary world...|$|E

30|$|We {{used the}} {{criteria}} described {{in each of}} the previous sections to quantify the databases. Regarding availability, the downtime was used as a primary measure, together with relevant studies [5, 27]. Consistency was graded according to two essential criteria: 1) how much the database can provide ACID-semantics consistency and 2) how much can consistency be fine-tuned. Durability was measured according to the use of single or multi version concurrency control schemes, the way that data are persisted to disk (e.g. if data is always asynchronously persisted, this hinders durability), and studies that specifically targeted durability [26]. Regarding maintainability, the criteria were the currently available literature studies of real world experiments, the ease of setup and use, as well as the <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools</b> to interact with the database. For read and write performance, we considered recent studies [27] and the fine-tuning of each database, as noted in the previous sections. Reliability is graded according to the taxonomy presented in [49] and by looking at synchronous propagation modes (databases which do not support them tend to be less reliable, as Domaschka et. al note). Database robustness was assessed with the real world experiments carried by researchers, as well as the available documentation on possible tendency of databases to have problems dealing with crashes or attacks (e.g. being subject to DoS attacks). With respect to scalability, we looked at each database’s elasticity, its increase in performance due to horizontal scaling, and the ease of on-line scalability (i.e. is the live addition of nodes supported?). For recovery time and stabilization time, highly related to availability, we based our classification on the results shown in [27] (implying that our grading of these attributes is mostly limited to their particular study and should be taken with apprpriate care). We looked at the databases described in Section ‘Evaluated NoSQL databases’.|$|E

The Spatial Network Analysis for Multimodal Urban Transport Systems (SNAMUTS) tool is used as a practical example to demonstrate how city planners can find answers as they seek to improve public transport accessibility. Uniquely among the new generation <b>of</b> <b>accessibility</b> <b>tools,</b> SNAMUTS has been designed for multi-city comparisons. A range of indicators are employed in each city including: the effectiveness of the public transport network; the relationship between the transport network and land use activity; who gets access within the city; and how resilient the city will be. The cities selected enable a comparison between cities by old world new world; public transport modes; governance approach; urban development constraints. The book is arranged along six themes that address the different planning challenges cities confront. Richly illustrated with maps and diagrams, this volume acts as a comprehensive sourcebook <b>of</b> <b>accessibility</b> indicators and a snapshot of current policy making around the world in the realm of strategic planning for land use transport integration and the growth of public transport.
