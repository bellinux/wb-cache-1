In September 1883, Thomas Higgins, then 45, became yet {{another member of the}} household to fall mysteriously ill. His stomach pains were severe enough that Doctor Whitford was called; the doctor attributed Higgins's illness to dysentery related to drinking cheap whiskey and prescribed opium and castor oil. Higgins died <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> illness. Days later, the same doctor was contacted and asked to provide a death certificate.

One of Livingston's captains, Jeremy Duggan, had, on September 13, floated two nine-pound guns past St. Jean, and these guns were put to use to that end. Chambly, which was garrisoned by only 82 men, mostly from the 7th Foot, was surrendered on October 18 by its commander, Major Joseph Stopford, <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> bombardment. Most seriously, Stopford failed to destroy supplies that were vitally useful to the Americans, primarily gunpowder, but also winter provisions.

With the British defense weakened, on October 14, 1781 Washington sent two columns to attack the last major remaining British outer defenses. A French column took Redoubt No. 9 and an American column took Redoubt No. 10. With these defenses taken, the allies were able to finish their second parallel. With the American artillery closer and its bombardment more intense than ever, the British position began to deteriorate rapidly and Cornwallis asked for capitulation terms on October 17. <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> negotiation, the surrender ceremony occurred on October 19; Lord Cornwallis was absent from the ceremony.

5|$|After {{purchasing}} a decrepit yacht, the Granma, on 25 November 1956 Castro set sail from Tuxpan, Veracruz, with 81 revolutionaries armed with 90 rifles, 3 machine guns, around 40 pistols and 2 hand-held anti-tank guns. The 1,200 mile crossing to Cuba was harsh, {{and in the}} overcrowded conditions of the ship, many suffered seasickness, and food supplies ran low. At some points they had to bail water caused by a leak, and at another a man fell overboard, delaying their journey. The plan had been for the crossing to take 5 days, and on the ship's scheduled day of arrival, 30 November, MR-26-7 members under Frank Pais led an armed uprising against government buildings in Santiago, Manzanillo and several other towns. However, the Granmas journey ultimately lasted 7 days, and with Castro and his men unable to provide reinforcements, Pais and his militants dispersed <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> intermittent attacks.|$|E
5|$|Although Lochry {{knew that}} he was in hostile territory, he landed his little {{flotilla}} <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> nonstop travel because he needed to feed his men and horses. After landing, the Americans cooked fresh buffalo meat for breakfast and cut grass for their horses, apparently not taking proper security precautions. Concealed in the nearby woods, Brant repositioned his men and then opened fire, taking the Americans completely by surprise. Some Americans fought until their ammunition ran out, although others apparently did not have their weapons ready when the attack began. Some of the Americans attempted to escape by boat, but Brant had anticipated this and had positioned men in canoes to cut off any retreat. Seeing that he was hopelessly trapped, Lochry called for his men to surrender.|$|E

5|$|On 3 August, General Guglielmo Nasi led 35,000 Italian troops, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of them native fighters, across the border into British Somaliland. The invaders were organized into three columns: one on the left advancing north to the coast before swinging east to Berbera, one on the right making the opposite motion on the Burao road, and a main central column, led by Carlo de Simone, containing the bulk of his forces. The central column would force the British positions at Tug Argan and make straight for Berbera, effectively ending the campaign in one fell swoop. Nasi advanced quickly upon Hargeisa, forcing harrying British camel soldiers to withdraw by 5 August. After a few days of rest and rearmament, the march was resumed on 8 August. <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> probing, de Simone reached the Tug Argan gap and prepared for the major assault, scheduled for 11 August.

The shredded roots were submerged in the respective treatments during 3 min (ascorbic acid or citric acid) and stored at 5 ºC and 90 % RH during 10 days. The radish treated with ascorbic acid showed the higher respiratory rate in the first 4 h after the processing during the storage. The content of total soluble solids (TSS) was significantly higher in the treatment with citric acid. There was an increase in the content <b>of</b> ascorbic acid <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> storage in the treatments with this antioxidant. The values of lightness (L*) were decreasing along the storage. Citric acid treatments caused strongly red coloration in the minimally processed roots.

The 2nd Corps re-assembled behind the Prijedor OG 10 and Serbian troops. As the ARBiH approached the two towns, the HV launched Operation Una on 18 September, which involved attempts to cross the Una River at several points near Bosanska Dubica, Bosanska Kostajnica and Novi Grad opposite Dvor.

5|$|Encouraged by {{the news}} of the uprisings, Madero crossed the border back into Mexico in February 1911. He was joined by Pancho Villa and Orozco and in April the army began {{approaching}} Ciudad Juárez. Orozco and Villa led the way with 500 men each, while Madero followed up with 1,500 riders. The city was besieged {{by the end of the}} month, after Madero's army encountered some resistance in the Chihuahuan countryside. Madero asked the commander of the city's garrison to surrender but the latter refused, hoping that the fortifications he had constructed would allow him to defend the city until reinforcements arrived. Concerned also with the possibility that a direct attack on the town would cause artillery shells to cross the border into the United States which could provoke an outside intervention, and faced with a series of peace proposals from Díaz, Madero hesitated in attacking the city. He in fact ordered his commanders to lift the siege. Orozco, however disregarded the order and, joined by Villa, attacked. <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> fighting the city fell to the insurrectionists. Madero intervened personally to spare the life of the city's commander, Gen. Navarro, whom both Orozco and Villa wanted executed for his previous killing of rebel POWs. This, coupled with the fact that both leaders were ignored by Madero in his political appointments, outraged and estranged them from him.|$|E

An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by her doctor and dressers. One of Albert's dressing gowns was placed by her side, with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of John Brown's hair, along with a picture of him, was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers.
