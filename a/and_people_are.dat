Things complicate as the dimension of the Dark World appears <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> being abducted throughout Hyrule. The four Links learn that not only have the knights of Hyrule mysteriously disappeared, but evil versions of them have been creating havoc. Hyrule castle has been taken over and monsters are appearing everywhere. The four Links agree that they will defeat Vaati, and then rescue Zelda to restore peace to Hyrule.|$|E

25|$|Pit latrines {{are often}} {{relocated}} or re-built after some years (when the pit is full {{and if the}} pit is not emptied) and thus need more space than urine-diverting dry toilets for example <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> less willing {{to invest in a}} nice high-quality super-structure as {{it will have to be}} dismantled at some point.|$|E

25|$|The monsoon also complicates {{transportation}} with {{roads and}} trails washing out while unpaved roads and airstrips may become unusable and cloud cover reduces safety margins for aviation.

By this time, the harvest is completed <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> in a festive mood. The two biggest and most important Hindu festivals—Dashain and Tihar (Dipawali)—arrive during this period, about one month apart. The post monsoon season lasts until about December.|$|E

25|$|From about 1500 BC, bronze was {{gradually}} introduced, but {{the use of}} stone implements continued; Norway had few riches to barter for bronze goods, and the few finds consist mostly of elaborate weapons and brooches that only chieftains could afford. Huge burial cairns built close to the sea as far north as Harstad and also inland in the south are characteristic of this period. The motifs of the rock carvings differ from those typical of the Stone Age. Representations of the Sun, animals, trees, weapons, ships, <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> all strongly stylised.|$|E
25|$|Today, many {{commonly}} encountered Taiwanese proper names (places <b>and</b> <b>people)</b> <b>are</b> {{written in}} Wade–Giles (a historic semi-official system), Chinese postal romanization (the system most used by Western academics until the internationalization of Hanyu Pinyin in the 1980s), or Gwoyeu Romatzyh (a system that records tones without tone marks).

25|$|An {{additional}} {{source to}} environmental pollution with pharmaceuticals is improper disposal of unused or expired drug residues. In European countries take-back systems for such residues are usually in place (although not always utilized to full extent) while in e.g. the US only voluntary initiatives {{on a local}} basis exist. Though most of the waste goes to incineration <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> asked to throw unused or expired pharmaceuticals into the household waste investigations in Germany showed that up to 24% of liquid pharmaceuticals and 7% of tablets or ointments are disposed always or at least “rarely” via the toilet or sink. Proper destruction of pharma residues should yield rest products without any pharmaceutical or ecotoxic activity. Furthermore, the residues should not act as components in the environmental formation of new such products. Incineration at a high temperature (>1000 degrees Celsius) is considered to fulfil the requirements, but even following such incineration residual ashes from the incineration should be properly taken care of.|$|E
25|$|After the {{introduction}} come {{the words of}} Kohelet. As king he has experienced everything and done everything, but nothing is ultimately reliable. Death levels all. The only good is to partake {{of life in the}} present, for enjoyment is from the hand of God. Everything is ordered in time <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> subject to time in contrast to God's eternal character. The world is filled with injustice, which only God will adjudicate. God and humans do not belong in the same realm and it is therefore necessary to have a right attitude before God. People should enjoy, but should not be greedy; no-one knows what is good for humanity; righteousness and wisdom escape us. Kohelet reflects on the limits of human power: all people face death, and death is better than life, but we should enjoy life when we can. The world is full of risk: he gives advice on living with risk, both political and economic. Mortals should take pleasure when they can, for a time may come when no one can. Kohelet's words finish with imagery of nature languishing and humanity marching to the grave.|$|E

500|$|Palmer {{felt that}} the {{characters}} of Marston and Williamson represented siblings in their former gang, while Dutch {{was more of a}} parental figure. He stated that Williamson is envious of Marston, despite Marston being his [...] "moral anchor". Palmer also felt that, after Marston left the gang, Williamson's life began to [...] "tailspin" [...] uncontrollably. [...] "s John grew into a man who conquered by achieving, Bill fell into a man who achieved simply by conquering," [...] said Palmer. The character of Edgar Ross was partly inspired by lawyer and political activist Charles Joseph Bonaparte, while the in-game Mexican Revolution of Nuevo Paraíso was somewhat based on the Plan de San Diego. When developing other characters, the team was inspired by various historical figures of the 20th century, including Frank James, Pearl Hart and Tom Horn. In terms of the random non-player character (NPC) dialogue, Houser felt that Redemption sits between Bully, in which NPCs remember the protagonist, and Grand Theft Auto, in which NPCs are unaware of the protagonist's identity. [...] "here are countryside environments <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> to some extent bored so they're looking for thing to talk about so your actions get spoken about <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> aware of you more," [...] said Houser.|$|E
