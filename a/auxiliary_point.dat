In the 1995 it was found, that the most performance for show jumping sport of the ranking top 300 horses are germans warmblood breeds with 6, 25 PPB.

Introducing a haptic device into CMM {{inspection path}} planning leads {{to the development of}} the proposed novel CMM off-line inspection path planning environment called haptic virtual CMM (HVCMM). HVCMM is an accurate e model ofa real CMM, which simulates a CMM's operation and its measurement process in a virtual environment with haptic perception. Due to the force feed back in the operation, the inspection path planning process is more intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly. The inspection path generation procedure is carried out in several steps: first, the measuring points are selected by operators using "point-and-click" method; second, the measuring points are offset according to the surface geometry and the offset points are linked with line segments; third, the linked path is traced by the virtual CMM probe to perform collision detection; fourth, when a collision occurred, an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>point</b> method and a teach pendant method are developed to generate a collision-free path with the aid of haptic constraint plane.
