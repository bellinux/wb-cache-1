One set of balde tips (7 A) was of rectangular shape, the other one (7 AD 1) of swept-back parabolic/anhedral shape. the main objectives of this experimental research were (1) to evaluate noise reduction techniques (conceptionally by variation of rotor speed, dedicated tip shapes and advanced airfoils as well as operationally by identifying low BVI noise decent procedures) and (2) to validate the partners' individual aerodynamic and aeroacoustic codes developed or improved in other tasks of this research programme.

40|$|Raspet, Bass, {{and others}} have carried {{out a number of}} studies of sonic boom {{propagation}} using algorithms that {{can be traced back to}} a 1973 doctoral thesis written by Pestorius at the University of Texas. The algorithm was originally set forth without a formal derivation from a governing set of partial differential equations. Perusal of Pestorius's report and of subsequent reports from the Texas nonlinear <b>accoustics</b> group suggests that such a derivation has not yet appeared in the archival literature. The author and his colleagues, on the other hand, have been working with an explicit set of approximate partial differential equations analogous to Burgers' equation. The present paper traces through the pertinent statements in the Pestorius reports and shows that the derived algorithm, at least in the limit of sufficiently short steps, is equivalent to the numerical solution of a similar (and nearly equivalent) explicit set of partial differential equations. The tying-together of the two approaches is important because it is possible that some of the basic ideas embodied in the Pestorius algorithm may be incorporated in other contexts where more nearly general models of sonic boom propagation through realistic atmospheres are to be solved numerically...|$|R

40|$|André Charrak : Music between {{physics and}} mathematics. Jean-Philippe Rameau' s treatises, which propose the first {{systematic}} formulation of harmonic tonality, are {{also based on}} certain traditional procedures rooted in arithmetical manipulations of the monochord. But they also, for the first time, call on the phenomenon of resonance of sonorous bodies, {{which is at the}} heart of the development of experimental <b>accoustics.</b> Music thus appears as both a physical and a mathematical science. But the reception of these works by Enlightenment philosophers tested this pretension, for Rameau' s experiments were sometimes non-existent, and the manipulation of proportions does not have the rigorous character of a geometrical demonstration. The present study shows, however, that these criticisms, far from remaining purely negative, bring out the gnoseological implications which Rameau did not bother to explain and which are best expressed by Diderot in the principle of the perception of relationships. D'Alembert' s criticisms of Rameau thus correspond to a more serious opposition, between D'Alembert and Euler, whose work provided one of the sources for Diderot's ideas. Charrak André.

40|$|Ecological {{studies of}} the Northeast Atlantic minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), {{initiated}} in 1992, were continued in 1993. The field work {{was carried out in}} spring (15 April- 15 May), summer (15 June- 12 July) and autumn (25 August- 20 September) using four chartered small-type whaling vessels which operated in four selected subareas. To ensure random sampling of whales, stringent sampling procedures, where the vessels searched for whales along predetermined transects within each subarea, was applied. Concurrent with the sampling of minke whales, estimates of potential prey abundance were carried out using <b>accoustics</b> and trawls. A total of 69 whales were shot; 5, 35 and 29 in spring, summer and autumn, respectively. Preliminary results from the stomach analyses indicate a diet where fish play a very prominent role. Diet varied between both periods and areas. Gadoid fish species dominated the spring diet. In summer and autumn the diet in the northmost areas (Spitsbergen and Bear Island) was primarily characterized by the presence of krill, to a much lesser extent by capelin. This is consistent with an increase in krill and severe decrease in capelin availability in these areas in 1993. In the coastal areas of North Norway, herring is the dominant planktivorous fish, and was also the most important food item for the whales both in summer and autumn. To some extent, however, the herring was accompanied by some gadoid species during summer. Whale consumption of 0 -group fish were observed to be rather limited. Along with material necessary for the study of condition and diet, sampling was also carried out for a number of other studies included in the framework of the Norwegian scientific catch program...|$|R
5000|$|Balin's {{reluctance}} to tour {{had kept the}} band off the road for over a year, and Slick's alcoholism increasingly became a problem, which led to two consecutive nights of disastrous concerts in Germany in June 1978. On the first night, the band was scheduled to perform at the Lorelei Amphitheater in Germany, on the bill with Leo Kottke and the Atlanta Rhythm Section, but Grace was too ill to perform. The rest of the band {{was willing to go}} on without Grace, in configurations playing a set not dependent upon her vocals. But to avoid disappointing the audience, Kantner insisted the show be cancelled. “He made his decision; if Grace would not perform, the Starship could not perform. ‘Look, man,’ he said, raising his eyes to the others. ‘We can't play, It would be like the Stones without Jagger. I don't want to fool our audience. Balin and Sears, who were back at the hotel with Kantner and Slick, protested, but Kantner was adamant.” “The three Starship musicians at the gig - Freiberg, Barbata, and Chaquico - discussed the possibility of the three of them performing alone. That was ruled out because there wasn't a singer amongst them.” There was an announcement made to the fans that the band would perform for them on July 2, but the crowd would have none of it. Bottles and stones began flying, and the stage was ransacked and set ablaze. “They had lost virtually everything. The gear they had spent 12 years tuning to perfection. All their guitars; Chaquicos 1959 Les Paul Sunburst, his '57 Gold Top. The Fender Jazz bass Pete Sears had played exclusively for 16 years. Barbata's vintage cymbals. Guitar losses alone totalled five Gibsons, five Fenders, two Rickenbackers, an Ibanez double neck, a custom bass, two Guild <b>accoustics</b> and a pair of Ovation acoustic / electrics. The Starship had brought $160,000 of equipment into Germany. About $15,000 remained, including three mixers heroically saved by the sound engineers.” A shell-shocked band, who had scrambled to find replacement gear, made it to the show in Hamburg the next night. Slick, in a drunken stupor, shocked that audience by swearing and making sexual references throughout most of her songs. She also reminded the audience that their country had lost World War II, repeatedly asking [...] "Who won the war?", and implied that all residents of Germany were responsible for the wartime atrocities.56After the debacle, Kantner asked for Slick's resignation from the band.|$|R

Moreover local flow properties are particularly sensitive towards inclined inflow typically occuring under realistic side-wind conditions.
