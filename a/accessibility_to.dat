5|$|During {{the last}} decade of the 19th century, {{minerals}} such as gold were mined with limited success. The last mine was abandoned in 1907, but panning for gold is still allowed in many areas of the forest, and in most circumstances no permit is required. After the end of the mining era, numerous camps were established by the Civilian Conservation Corps to help combat unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The camps housed groups of unemployed men who were paid by the federal government to build roads, hiking trails, and campgrounds for future travelers to the Yellowstone region. Visitation to national forests like Shoshone increased dramatically after World War II with the advent of better roads and <b>accessibility</b> <b>to</b> the region.|$|E

The Kalahari Meerkat Project noted that the film was not completely accurate but praised it overall and recommended against analyzing it. Several reviewers praised Goldberg's narration, but the script was criticized as being too simplistic for adult viewers.|$|E
5|$|The school runs on {{a shoestring}} budget as a {{tradeoff}} for its financial independence and <b>accessibility</b> <b>to</b> low-income students. Tuition is billed on a sliding scale based on what parents can afford. Revenue from rental properties and fundraising supplements tuition income. The Free School started a high school program in 2006. It later spun off as the Harriet Tubman Democratic High School and enrolls about 20 students in both self-directed and traditional classes. Alumni of the school have attended a variety of colleges. Journalists have noted the school's similarity to unschooling and homeschooling, and its work to that of prefigurative politics. The Albany Free School {{is one of the}} few schools remaining from the 1960s and 1970s free school movement. It inspired the program of the Brooklyn Free School.|$|E
5|$|The trails {{through the}} park, {{including}} one for mountain biking, run almost parallel along the ridge. There is a natural pond with fishes and turtles in the north-west of the park.

5|$|The {{state has}} a large, {{multimodal}} transportation system with the largest road network in the country. The state is well connected to its nine neighbouring states and almost all other parts of India through the national highways (NH). It boasts 42 national highways, with a total length of 4,942km (9.6% of the total NH length in India). The Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation was established in 1972 to provide economical, reliable, and comfortable transportation in the state with connecting services to adjoining states and boasts as being the only State Transport Corporation that runs in profit in the entire nation. All cities are connected to state highways, and all district headquarters are being connected with four lane roads which carry traffic between major centres within the state. One of them is Agra Lucknow Expressway, which is a 302km (188mi) controlled-access highway constructed by Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) to reduce vehicular traffic in previously congested roads. This expressway is country’s largest Greenfield Expressway which reduced the travel time between Lucknow and Agra from 6 hours to 3.30 hours. Other district roads and village roads provide villages <b>accessibility</b> <b>to</b> meet their social needs as also the means to transport agriculture produce from village to nearby markets. Major district roads provide a secondary function of linking between main roads and rural roads. Uttar Pradesh has the highest road density in India, (1,027km per 1000km2) and the largest surfaced urban-road network in the country (50,721km).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} work {{undertaken to}} date {{as part of}} PhD research into the process of Accessibility Planning in the UK and how existing objective measures of <b>accessibility</b> relate <b>to</b> individual perceptions or the "lived experience" of accessibility. Since 1997, Accessibility has been framed in the social exclusion context within UK transport planning and policy, focusing {{on the ability of}} people to participate fully in society, which is seen as being limited by poor accessibility. This approach recognises that factors other than spatial location are important and places importance on barriers <b>to</b> <b>accessibility</b> such as information, cost and, safety and security as well as provision of transport services and journey times (Social Exclusion Unit, 2003). Despite this recognition, accessibility measures and indicators tend to focus on the objective journey time or distance of people to destinations, and do not consider more subjective factors such as convenience, physical mobility, safety and cost. This research critically appraises dominant approaches <b>to</b> <b>accessibility</b> planning, reviewing current approaches based upon their practicality, data requirements and outcomes, before presenting a mixed methods, case study approach to understand how perceived or "lived" accessibility differs from currently used objective measures. Engagement with practitioners has led to a greater understanding of the requirements of policy makers in improving accessibility and how the process of <b>accessibility</b> planning links <b>to</b> desired policy outcomes. Primary fieldwork involves understanding individual perceptions and subjective <b>accessibilities,</b> <b>to</b> form comparison with existing objective measures of accessibility.
