40|$|The {{design of}} the {{excavator}} follows requirements of machines for demolition work. The excavator is equipped with an innovative type of under carriage, which not only increases mobility over the demolition sites but also the visibility from the driver’s cabin. The components of the excavator, that improve the demolition work, are special types of tracks, suspensions and articulated steering. Tracks can change their shape to increase the stability and also {{to adapt to the}} diff erent types of ground. The suspensions with tracks are able to adapt to the terrain thereby they lighten the asperity. Suspension can also tilt or even raise the excavator and thereby increase the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> from the cabin. This function is necessary mainly when taking down higher constructions. Articulated steering is a new function that has never been used for excavators. This steering was chosen due to fl exible movement over demolition sites. The main aim of the project is to create a new {{design of the}} excavator, but more importantly to distinguish the excavator from the excavators already on the market, with regards to its esthetics and under carriage innovation...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{broadening}} the knowledge of aspects of holography by examining three areas of importance, namely: i) qualitative holographic nondestructive testing, as applicable to flaw detection, ii) quantitative holographic interferometry and iii) white-light transfer reflection holography, with particular emphasis on the multiplexing principle. The objects {{used to evaluate the}} viability of qualitative holographic nondestructive testing were various carbon fibre airframe sections, a ceramic tube and a ceramic mould. The real-time and double-exposure holographic techniques were used to investigate the objects. Hot air was employed as the stress application medium. The results obtained clearly show the viability of holography as a nondestructive testing technique for the detection of debonds, delaminations, cracks, etcetera. In {{the second part of the}} study, the zero-order and fringe-counting techniques were applied to a cantilever loading experiment as a means of quantitatively determining the cantilever's displacement. It was determined that displacements with an accuracy of circa 85 % could be obtained by using the abovementioned techniques. In the final part of this study the transfer and multiplexing principles were rigorously examined. As a result, it was found that when reflection holograms were used as masters, excessively dim transfer holograms were produced. Transmission masters produced much brighter transfer holograms and displayed the capability of individually reproducing the images recorded. However, the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> of the individual images produced was found to be unsatisfactory and therefore warrants further investigation...|$|E

The study includes documentation of the low-speed handling qualities {{as well as the}} pilots' evaluations of the landing-approach characteristics. All the pilots who flew the airplane considered it more comfortable to fly at low speeds than any other F- 100 configuration they had flown. The major improvements noted were the reduced stall speed, the improved longitudinal stability at high lift, and the reduction in low-speed buffet. The study has shown the minimum comfortable landing-approach speeds are between 120. 5 and 126. 5 knots compared to 134 for the airplane with a slatted leading edge and the same trailing-edge flap. The limiting factors in the pilots' choices of landing-approach speeds were the limits of ability to control flight-path <b>angle,</b> lack <b>of</b> <b>visibility,</b> trim change with thrust, low static directional stability, and sluggish longitudinal control. Several of these factors were found {{to be associated with the}} high <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack, between 13 deg. and 15 deg., required for the low approach speeds.

40|$|TEM {{analysis}} of mesoporous materials is generally undertaken to give qualitative results. Accurate quantitative analysis is demonstrated in this study. A systematic image {{analysis of}} a powder form of a hexagonal mesoporous material known as KIT- 6 is conducted using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Three types of image contrast typically appear in this material (a hexagonal honeycomb structure, wide and narrow parallel lines). The honeycomb face is used to characterise this material {{in terms of a}} conventional 2 -D hexagonal structure and the d-spacings for the (100) and (110) planes are experimentally measured in varying focus conditions. A tilting experiment is conducted to determine how the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> tilt affects the line spacing and their visibility. Tilting has very little effect on the line spacing, whereas it affects the <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> both the wide and narrow lines by limiting an <b>angle</b> range <b>of</b> <b>visibility.</b> The hexagonal lattice structure parameter determined by TEM method is found to be similar to 7 % lower than that calculated by low-angle X-ray diffraction. Thus we conclude that TEM data can be used to determine the geometry and dimensions of hexagonal mesoporous silica materials, with a small error in the hexagonal lattice parameter.

40|$|Context. Unveiling the {{structure}} of the disks around intermediate-mass pre-main-sequence stars (Herbig Ae/Be stars) is essential for our understanding of the star and planet formation process. In particular, models predict that in the innermost AU around the star, the dust disk forms a “puffed-up ” inner rim, which should result in a strongly asymmetric brightness distribution for disks seen under intermediate inclination. Aims. Our aim is to constrain the sub-AU geometry of the inner disk around the Herbig Ae star R CrA and search for the predicted asymmetries. Methods. Using the VLTI/AMBER long-baseline interferometer, we obtained 24 near-infrared (H- and K-band) spectro-interferometric observations on R CrA. Observing with three telescopes in a linear array configuration, each data set samples three equally spaced points in the visibility function, providing direct information about the radial intensity profile. In addition, the obser-vations cover a wide position angle range (∼ 97 ◦), also probing the position <b>angle</b> dependence <b>of</b> the source brightness distribution. Results. In the derived visibility function, we detect the signatures of an extended (Gaussian FWHM ∼ 25 mas) and a compact component (Gaussian FWHM ∼ 5. 8 mas), with the compact component contributing about two-thirds of the total flux (both in H- and K-band). The brightness distribution is highly asymmetric, as indicated by the strong closure phases (up to ∼ 40 ◦) and the detected position <b>angle</b> dependence <b>of</b> the <b>visibilities</b> and closure phases.

40|$|We {{extend the}} concept of the polygon visible from a source point S in a simple polygon by {{considering}} visibility with two types of reflection, specular and diffuse. In specular reflection a light ray reflects from an edge of the polygon according to the rule: the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> incidence equals the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> reflection. In diffuse reflection a light ray reflects from an edge of the polygon in all inward directions. Several geometric and combinatorial properties <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> polygons under these two types of reflection are described, when at most one reflection is permitted. We show that the visibility polygon Vs(S) under specular reflection may be non-simple, while the visibility polygon Vd(S) under diffuse reflection is always simple. We present a Θ(n 2) worst-case bound on the combinatorial complexity of both Vs(S) and Vd(S) and describe simple O(n 2 log 2 n) time algorithms for constructing the sets. 1 Introduction Visibility problems have a long history [21], with [...] ...|$|R

These systems will use satellites on low earth orbits (LEO) and on medium earth orbits (MEO) in order to provide personal communication from (almost) every point on the earth.
