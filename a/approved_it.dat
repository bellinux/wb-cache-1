5|$|Article One {{came within}} one {{state of the}} number needed to become adopted into the Constitution on two {{occasions}} between 1789 and 1803. Despite coming close to ratification early on, it has never received the approval of enough states {{to become part of}} the Constitution. As Congress did not attach a ratification time limit to the article, it is still technically pending before the states. Since no state has <b>approved</b> <b>it</b> since 1792, ratification by an additional 27 states would now be necessary for the article to be adopted.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlin jealously guarded his position. In late 1943, Chamberlin {{differed}} {{with one}} of his planners, Brigadier General Bonner Fellers, over a proposed landing at Hansa Bay. Fellers thought that Hansa Bay could be bypassed, but Chamberlin felt that this would be too risky. While Fellers was a newcomer to GHQ, he had known MacArthur for many years, and Fellers took his proposal directly to MacArthur, who <b>approved</b> <b>it.</b> A furious Chamberlin had Fellers fired from G-3. MacArthur made him his military secretary.|$|E

The repository concept is similar to the Swedish model, with containers to be clad in copper and buried below the water table beginning in 2020. An underground characterization facility, Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository, was under construction at the site in 2012.|$|E

His work on it gave Jones the foresight to pitch another show he knew the network would want. Initially unsure if {{he was ready to}} pitch AJ's Infinite Summer, the network rejected the pilot the first time he did but <b>approved</b> <b>it</b> on the second, after he had reworked it throughout a few months. Jones contrasted the physical limitations of animating in time and energy to the animation of the pilot itself. He cited having the character of AJ run up a wall in one scene as an example of this.|$|E

5|$|Washington had {{established}} his preeminence {{among the new}} nation's Founding Fathers through his service as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War and {{as president of the}} 1787 Constitutional Convention. Once the Constitution was <b>approved,</b> <b>it</b> was widely expected that Washington would become the first President of the United States, despite his own desire to retire from public life. In his first inaugural address expressed both his reluctance to accept the presidency and his inexperience with the duties of civil administration, but Washington proved an able leader.|$|E

5|$|At 9a.m. on 11 November, Whitlam, {{together}} with {{deputy prime minister}} Frank Crean and Leader of the House Fred Daly, met with the Liberal and Country party leaders. No compromise could be reached. Whitlam informed the Coalition leaders {{that he would be}} advising Kerr to hold a half-Senate election on 13December, and he would not be seeking interim supply for the period before the election. Thinking it unlikely that Kerr would grant the election without supply, Fraser warned Whitlam that the Governor-General might make up his own mind about the matter. Whitlam was dismissive and after the meeting broke, telephoned Kerr to tell him that he needed an appointment to advise him to hold a half-Senate election. Both men were busy in the morning, Kerr with Remembrance Day commemorations, and Whitlam with a caucus meeting and a censure motion in the House which the Opposition had submitted. The two discussed a meeting for 1:00p.m., though Kerr's office later called Whitlam's and confirmed the time as 12:45. Word of this change did not reach the Prime Minister. Whitlam announced the request for a half-Senate election to his caucus, which <b>approved</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bagration {{called for}} the First, Second and Third Belorussian and the First Baltic Fronts to engulf Army Group Center. Bagramyan was tasked with attacking the forces in the pocket, cross the Daugava River and, along with Third Belorussian, clear the {{surrounding}} areas of Vitebsk of German forces. Although he felt {{the plans for the}} Bagration were sound, he worried {{about the possibility of a}} German incursion by Army Group North against his forces from the north. He appealed to his superiors once more, Zhukov and Alexander Vasilevsky, to have the First Baltic Front move westward to help eliminate the Third Panzer Army, thus splitting Army Group North in two. Zhukov and Vasilevsky accepted his argument, introducing it to Stalin in a meeting on 23 May who formally <b>approved</b> <b>it</b> in a directive on 31 May.|$|E

5|$|Barkley and {{his wife}} Dorothy took a {{vacation}} after the convention, returning to Kentucky in August 1928 to find that, in his absence, Barkley had been chosen state chairman of Smith's campaign. He campaigned for Smith, but Herbert Hoover won a landslide victory. After the election, Barkley led a coalition of liberal Democrats and Republicans that opposed Hoover's use of protective tariffs, a debate that took particular urgency following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Barkley opposed the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act, claiming it would cost Americans both jobs and exports, but Congress <b>approved</b> <b>it,</b> and Hoover signed it on June 17, 1930. When Congress adjourned, Barkley accompanied Sherwood Eddy and fellow senators Burton K. Wheeler and Bronson M. Cutting to the Soviet Union in August 1930. He {{was impressed by the}} industrial development brought about by Joseph Stalin's first five-year plan but did not advocate closer diplomatic ties with the Communist nation, as some of his colleagues did.|$|E
5|$|Garfield's {{assassination}} by an office-seeker amplified {{the public}} demand for civil service reform. Both Democratic and Republican leaders {{realized that they}} could attract the votes of reformers by turning against the spoils system, and by 1882 a bipartisan effort began in favor of reform. In the previous Congress, Sherman's fellow Ohio Senator, Democrat George H. Pendleton, had introduced legislation that required selection of civil servants based on merit as determined by an examination, but Congress declined to act on it right away. Republicans lost seats in the 1882 congressional elections, in which Democrats campaigned on the reform issue, and in the lame duck session were more amenable to civil service reform. Sherman spoke in favor of merit selection and against removing employees from office without cause. He was against the idea that civil servants should have unlimited terms of office but believed that efficiency, not political activity, should determine an employee's length of service. Sherman {{voted in favor of}} Pendleton's bill, and the Senate <b>approved</b> <b>it</b> 38–5. The House concurred by a vote of 155–47. Arthur signed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act into law on January16, 1883.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{returned}} to his seat in Congress in the late fall of 1812. Based on his experience, he proposed a plan to defeat the mobile, guerrilla warfare of the Indians. American troops moved slowly, dependent on a supply line. Indians would evade battle and raid supplies until the American forces withdrew or were overrun. Mounted riflemen could move quickly, carry their own supplies, and live off the woods. If they attacked Indian villages in winter, the Indians would be compelled to stand and fight for the supplies they used to wage war, and could be decisively defeated. Johnson submitted this plan to President James Madison and Secretary of War John Armstrong, who <b>approved</b> <b>it</b> in principle. They referred the plan to Harrison, who found winter operations impracticable. Johnson was permitted to try the tactics {{in the summer of}} 1813; later the US conducted Indian wars in winter with his strategy.|$|E

5|$|On July 14, 1969, US-60/US-77/US-177 west of Ponca City {{was moved}} to a new alignment, and a section of {{temporary}} highway linking the new road to the old road continuing west toward Tonkawa had the three U.S. designations applied to it. AASHO received the application for this move on August 25, and it was approved on October 26. Further west, the Oklahoma Department of Highways constructed a section of highway bypassing Tonkawa to the north and east. The Highway Commission approved moving US-60 to this highway and designating the old highway as US-60 Business on August 9, 1971. AASHO received an application for this change on October 8 of that year and <b>approved</b> <b>it</b> on December 4. The section of highway between the Tonkawa bypass and the Ponca City bypass was upgraded next; this road was designated as US-60/US-77/US-177 on November 7, 1974. This change was submitted to AASHO, now renamed to , on April 29, 1975, received on May 1, and approved on June 17.|$|E
5|$|The {{educational}} opportunities for secondary modern pupils were limited compared to those at grammar schools, prompting criticism of the Tripartite system. In 1965, the Labour Government issued Circular 10/65 requesting Local Education Authorities implement comprehensive schooling. In 1971 Sleaford parents voted in favour of comprehensive education, but rejected the Council's proposals. A new plan which envisaged Carre's becoming a sixth form college was supported by parents in a vote (1,199 to 628), albeit with a 50% turnout; the County Council <b>approved</b> <b>it</b> but allowed governors a veto. Following negotiations with governors at Carre's, the scheme was revised so that Carre's would be an 11–18 school and adsorb Sleaford Secondary Modern's Church Lane site. Despite support from most staff and all three headteachers, Lincolnshire County Council voted to return the scheme for consultation in 1975. A new system was proposed which retained all three schools, and when the Government ordered the Council to choose a comprehensive scheme in 1977 it submitted that proposal, which had become popular with parents. The next year the government dismissed it on grounds that the Sixth Forms would be too small, but the council voted against the two-school system once more.|$|E
5|$|The {{information}} available in Romania for the King Carol I Bridge in Cernavodă, {{as well as}} the results of scientists in France, say that the myths are pure fiction. First of all the Romanian government never finalised the construction contract with the company of Gustave Eiffel or with another foreign company, making the decision to build the bridge only with local companies. The Cernavodă Bridge was made entirely by Romanians, fulfilling the design of Anghel Saligny, which was also the supervisor of the site. In these conditions, not knowing if the contract will be <b>approved,</b> <b>it</b> is unlikely that a foreign company would build the whole superstructure of the bridge. On the other hand, in Austria–Hungary {{there was no need to}} construct a low bridge like the Faidherbe because of the trade routes on the Danube River.|$|E
