40|$|Pharmaceutical {{expenditure}} {{is currently}} rising by 16 % per annum in China, greater in recent years. Initiatives to moderate growth include drug pricing regulations, essential medicine lists and encouraging generic prescribing. These are principally concentrated in hospitals, which currently account for over 80 % of total pharmaceutical expenditure. However, no monitoring of prescribing and perverse incentives encouraging physicians and hospitals {{to profit from}} drug procurement encourages irrational prescribing. This includes greater utilisation of originators versus generics as well as injectables when cheaper oral equivalents are available. The objective of the paper is to assess changes in proton pump inhibitor (PPI) utilisation and expenditure in China as more generics become available including injectables. MethodsObservational retrospective study of PPI utilisation and procured expenditure between 2004 and 2013 in the largest teaching hospital in Chongqing District as representative of China. ResultsAppreciable increase in PPI utilisation {{during the study period}} rising 10. 4 fold, with utilisation of generics rising faster than originators. Oral generics reached 84 % of total oral preparations in 2013 (defined daily dose basis), with generic injectables 93 % of total injectables by 2013. Injectables accounted for 42 % of total PPI utilisations in 2008 and 2009 before falling to below 30 %. Procured prices for oral preparations reduced over time (? 34 %). Generic oral omeprazole in 2010 was 87 % below 2004 originator prices, mirroring reductions seen in Western Europe. Injectable prices also decreased over time (? 19 %). However, injectables typically 4. 3 to 6. 8 fold more expensive than equivalent orals - highest for injectable lansoprazole at 13. 4 to 18. 0 fold. High utilisation of more expensive oral forms as well as injectables meant that PPI expenditure increased 10. 1 fold during the study period. Lower use of injectables, and only oral generic omeprazole, would result in accumulated savings of CNY 249. 65 million, reducing total <b>accumulated</b> <b>expenditure</b> by 84 %. ConclusionsEncouraging to see high utilisation of generic PPIs and low prices for oral generics. However, considerable opportunities to enhance prescribing efficiency through greater use of oral generic omeprazole...|$|E
40|$|It is {{the aim of}} {{the present}} study to detect the reasons for these grievances, taking as an example the new Ecological Housing Estate Flintenbreite, and to {{demonstrate}} alternative solutions. For this purpose, different concepts of assessment are employed which meet the requirements of a full life cycle analysis. From the ecological perspective, these are the software tool GaBi of the University of Stuttgart, the MIPS concept of the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment, Energy as well as the software tool GEMIS from the Eco Institute. In order to assess {{the quantity and quality of}} the area consumption, a special calculation method was developed on the basis of “Hemerobiestufen”, which illustrate the degree of naturalness of a surface area. The BKI Kostenplaner of the Baukosteninformationszentrum is used to analyze the economic factors. In order to assess social aspects, a special assessment method on the basis of national and international discussions is developed and applied. Apart from taking into account generally accepted ecological indicators, this study also attempts to develop economic indicators as well as indicators for measuring social sustainability of housing development concepts. By means of a working example the practicability of these indicators is examined. For assessing the degree of sustainability reached at the Ecological Housing Estate Flintenbreite 15 indicators are used. These are: •	The Total Material Requirement (TMR) •	The <b>Accumulated</b> <b>Expenditure</b> of Energy (KEA) •	The Global Warming Potential related to 100 years (GWP 100) •	Area consumption •	Water consumption •	Planning and implementation costs •	Costs of construction and production •	Costs of utilization including maintenance costs •	Costs of pulling down, disposal and restoration •	Average renting costs •	Age composition of the residents •	Income structure of the residents •	Unemployment rate of the residents •	Quota of women employed •	Possibilities of participation of the residents For assessing and visualizing the several indicators, the COMPASS method, developed at the Wuppertal Institute, is applied. Since the process of construction at the Ecological Housing Estate Flintenbreite has been delayed as a result of the insolvencies of two of the developing companies, up to date only 26 of the planned 119 housing units have been completed. Therefore, in order to obtain valuable results the scientific approach had to be reduced in the course of this study. As the central elements of the approach the building above ground and the sewage concept, which has been used on a larger scale for the first time and which is based on a vacuum technique, are focused on. Apart from savings in water (only 1 liter per flush), this trend-setting, integrated sewage concept takes into account the utilization of nutrients and the energy content of excrements and biological waste. For that purpose, the flows grey water (residues without excrements), black water (toilet residues), rainwater and biological waste are dealt with separately within the whole concept. Through the fermentation of biological waste and excrements, biogas is won which is then used for power production in the housing estate’s own cogeneration plant. Three filters (constructed wetlands in the form of sand filters planted with reeds) are used for clearing the grey water. Using hollows on the 4. 9 hectare wide housing development area, rainwater can seep away directly. The liquid manure remaining after anaerobic treatment is collected in a reservoir and used for agricultural means. Thus, nutrient cycles can be completed. Despite partly positive results it must be stated that these building measures, with regard to the building above ground, do not make a valuable contribution as far as more sustainable building is concerned. The sewage concept appears to be more apt to meet this requirement, although optimizing steps have yet to follow. Stakeholders from many different fields can take such steps in their respective discipline but also with regard to the interdisciplinary perspective. The chance to act beyond the boundaries of one’s own discipline, the ability to communicate as a key to joint action as well as the ability to see and open up new paths require new approaches and possibilities of acting. Thus, it is the duty of private persons, functionaries and elected candidates alike to help ensure corresponding education and qualification. Apart from that, on the international level, it is essential to initiate a changed, honest and consistent orientation of the rules of the WTO, the ILO and the UNEP without which a sustainable development will continue to be a utopia. And perhaps we may even have to go one step further and overcome an economy of interest and compound interest that is destroying resources, in order to be able to live the dream of a sustainable economic system...|$|E

However, no monitoring of prescribing and perverse incentives enhances irrational prescribing. Review the influence of recent measures on subsequent utilization and expenditure of high-volume classes in China to provide future guidance. Principally a narrative review of published studies of the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), statins, renin–angiotensin inhibitor drugs and traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) between 2004 and 2013 in the largest teaching hospital group in Chongqing District. Appeciable increase in drug utilisation including TCMs. Generics typically only 30 % to 34 % of total utilisation for the molecule for CV medicines, with decreasing trends in recent years. Greater utilisation of generic PPIs; however, this includes generic injectable preparations with considerably higher prices. Prices decreased over time, with appreciable reductions for some generics. Overall, considerable opportunities to save resources without compromising care. Restricting the formulary to just one statin, angiotensin receptor blocker or PPI based on the cheapest one would have saved 50 - 84 % of total <b>accumulated</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Encouraging to see high utilisation of generic PPIs and low prices for some oral generics. However, real progress will only be made by addressing current perverse financial incentives.

40|$|Health-care {{providers}} {{can play}} an important role in promoting weight loss among their overweight and obese patients by promoting regular physical activity. Regular physical activity, performed at moderate-to-vigorous intensities has substantial health benefits. Physical activity is effective in reducing the risks for complications of obesity, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and diabetes. Regular physical activity is also associated with appetite suppression. The amount of physical activity recommended for promoting health and prevention of disease and early mortality by the Surgeon General 2 ̆ 7 s Report on Physical Activity and Health— 150 kcal/d or 1000 kcal/wk—is equal to a 1. 5 -mile brisk walk (1).

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} an empirical relationship between <b>accumulated</b> R&D <b>expenditures</b> and total factor productivity (TFP), and {{have shown that the}} benefits of R&D can spill across countries through trade. This paper extends these analyses to a sample of 15 OECD countries and six Asian countries, Chinese Taipei, India, Indonesia, Korea, Singapore and Thailand. An empirical model is estimated which relates TFP to domestic and foreign R&D activity, TFP catch-up and business cycle variables. Model estimates show that TFP and domestic R&D capital are positively related, and that domestic R&D has a relatively large impact on TFP growth in the NICs and LICs. Country-specific international R&D spillover elasticities are of mixed sign, and no apparent pattern by country group is evident. While this result does not change the earlier qualitative conclusions, it suggests that estimates of sample average R&D spillover elasticities should be cautiously interpreted. ...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{widespread}} consensus in the literature that, {{as a consequence of}} the demographic transition, the current Spanish pension systemwill become unsustainable in the decades coming. In this article we evaluate the sustainability of the contributory pension sub-system, taking into account the demographic projections by the Spanish Statistical Office (INE). A baseline scenario is projected as well as several reforms are simulated, focusing on: (i) an immigration policy, (ii) changes in the way of adjusting the pensions and (iii) increase of the legal age of retirement up to 68. Themain results are the following. The current systemwill not incur deficits until 2022, fromthis point onwards deficits will begin to be <b>accumulated.</b> The <b>expenditure</b> on pensions in terms of GDP will increased from 8. 3 % in 2009 to 17. 0 % in 2049. An immigration policy –aimed at foreign young people– would help, but would not ensure the long-term sustainability of the current system. A policy that combines pension growth at a pace lower than productivity growth and extends the legal age of retirement up to 68 would give solvency to the system beyond 2028.

40|$|This work {{is devoted}} to characterizing an optimal R&D {{investment}} policy for a growing economy {{taking into account the}} phenomenon of technology spillovers. We focus on the issue of a reasonable balance between domestic technologies and assimilated technology spillovers. Both factors require R&D expenditures inducing increase in production rate in the short run. The efficiency of the utilization of spillover technologies depends on the firm's assimilation capacity. The assimilation capacity {{is a function of the}} level the technology stock and ability to maximize the benefits of a learning exercise and, consequently, of the level of <b>accumulated</b> R&D <b>expenditures.</b> The domestic technology stock supposes high inputs into scientific, technological and production research. In the long run R&D investment leads to increase of sales and production diversity. We also take into account a nonlinear effect of the technology intensity on growth in production rate. The model is applied on a company level. We identify model's parameters using real data series (in particular, for the Sony Corporation). Using dynamic optimality principles the corresponding model is analyzed and the optimal level for the R&D intensity is constructed. The uniqueness of the optimal solution is stated and the properties of optimal regimes are explored...|$|R

40|$|Consumers {{of health}} care {{services}} with insurance plan features such as deductibles, copayments, and coverage ceilings, in which the price {{of health care}} depends upon <b>expenditures</b> <b>accumulated</b> during a single year, should rationally anticipate the impact of current consumption decisions {{on the price of}} health care later in the year. We show that in the absence of wealth effects and risk aversion, a utility-maximizing consumer should base current consumption decisions on the expected end-of-year price of health care. In a specific model with risk aversion and lumpy consumption decisions we show that the expected end-of-year price remains close to the true shadow price of health care for plausible insurance plan and demand parameters. We use this result in an econometric model of the demand for ambulatory mental health services. ...|$|R
40|$|Considering that hyperhomocysteinemia is an {{independent}} risk factor for cardiovascular disease, {{the purpose of this}} study was to determine the kinetics of serum homocysteine (tHcy) and the vitamins involved in its metabolism (folates, B 12, and B 6) in response to acute exercise at different intensities. Eight sedentary males (18 – 27 yr) took part in the study. Subjects were required to complete two isocaloric (400 kcal) acute exercise trials on separate occasions at 40 % (low intensity, LI) and 80 % VO 2 peak (high intensity, HI). Blood samples were drawn at different points before (pre 4 and pre 0 h), during (exer 10, exer 20, exer 30, exer 45, and exer 60 min), and after exercise (post 0, post 3, and post 19 h). Dietary, genetic, and lifestyle factors were controlled. Maximum tHcy occurred during exercise, both at LI (8. 6 (8. 0 – 10. 1) mmol/L, 9. 3 % increase from pre 0) and HI (9. 4 (8. 2 – 10. 6) mmol/L, 25. 7 % increase from pre 0), coinciding with an <b>accumulated</b> energy <b>expenditure</b> independent of the exercise intensity. From this point onwards tHcy declined until the cessation of exercise and continued descending. At post 19, tHcy was not different from pre-exercise values. No values of hyperhomocysteinemia were observed at any sampling point and intensity. In conclusion, acute exercise in sedentary individuals, even at HI, shows no negative effect on tHcy when at least 400 kcal are spent during exercise and the nutritional status for folate, B 12, and B 6 is adequate, since n...|$|R
40|$|Background: Change in body composition, {{specifically}} loss of fat-free {{mass and}} gain in fat mass, in older adults {{is a major}} pathway leading to the onset of functional decline and physical disability. Objective: The objective {{was to determine the}} association of activity-related energy expenditure with change in body mass and composition among older men and women. Design: Total energy expenditure (TEE) was assessed over 2 wk by using the doubly labeled water method in 302 communitydwelling older adults aged 70 - 82 y. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured by using indirect calorimetry, and the thermic effect of meals was estimated at 10 % of TEE. Activity energy expenditure (AEE) was calculated as [TEE(0. 9) 2 RMR]. Total body mass, fat-free mass (FFM), and fat mass (FM) were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry annually over a mean (±SD) of 4. 9 ± 1. 3 y. Results: In multivariate models adjusted for baseline age, smoking status, and race, men and women had a decline (in kg/y) in body mass (men: - 0. 34, 95 % CI: - 0. 71, 0. 02; women: - 0. 45, 95 % CI: - 0. 71, - 0. 19) and FFM (men: - 0. 48, 95 % CI: - 0. 67, - 0. 29; women: - 0. 14, 95 % CI: - 0. 026, - 0. 03). No changes (in kg/y) were observed in FM (men: 0. 14, 95 % CI: - 0. 10, 0. 38; women: - 0. 28, 95 % CI: - 0. 49, - 0. 07). In men and women, higher AEE at baseline was associated with greater FFM. The average change in these outcomes (ie, slope), however, was similar across tertiles of AEE. Conclusions: These data suggest that <b>accumulated</b> energy <b>expenditure</b> from all physical activities is associated with greater FFM, but the effect does not alter the trajectory of FFM change in late life. © 2009 American Society for Nutrition...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{economic}} impact of maternal death on rural Chinese households during the year after maternal death. METHODS: A prospective cohort study matched 183 households who had suffered a maternal death to 346 households that experienced childbirth without maternal death in rural areas of three provinces in China. Surveys were conducted at baseline (1 - 3 months after maternal death or childbirth) and one year after baseline using the quantitative questionnaire. We investigated household income, <b>expenditure,</b> <b>accumulated</b> debts, and self-reported household economic status. Difference-in-Difference (DID), linear regression, and logistic regression analyses were used to compare the economic status between households with and without maternal death. FINDINGS: The households with maternal death had a higher risk of self-reported "household economy became worse" during the follow-up period (adjusted OR =  6. 04, p< 0. 001). During the follow-up period, at the household level, DID estimator of income and expenditure showed that households with maternal death had a significant relative reduction of US$ 869 and US$ 650, compared to those households that experienced childbirth with no adverse event (p< 0. 001). Converted to proportions of change, an average of 32. 0 % reduction of annual income and 24. 9 % reduction of annual expenditure were observed in households with a maternal death. The mean increase of accumulated debts in households with a maternal death was 3. 2 times as high as that in households without maternal death (p =  0. 024). Expenditure pattern of households with maternal death changed, with lower consumption on food (p =  0. 037), clothes and commodity (p =  0. 003), traffic and communication (p =  0. 022) and higher consumption on cigarette or alcohol (p =  0. 014). CONCLUSION: Compared with childbirth, maternal death had adverse impact on household economy, including higher risk of self-reported "household economy became worse", decreased income and expenditure, increased debts and changed expenditure pattern...|$|R
