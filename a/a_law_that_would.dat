5|$|Louisiana {{attempted}} to pass <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> exempt fantasy sports from its anti-online gambling laws, but {{the bill was}} defeated {{as the result of}} lobbying by both the Louisiana Family Forum (which showed concerns that players could develop an addiction to daily fantasy games), and the Louisiana Video Gaming Association (which felt that DFS would cannibalize the legal video poker industry, and needed to be highly regulated).|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 1733, Faulkner advertised {{his future}} {{publication}} of Swift's collected works in four volumes in the Dublin Journal. However, this edition led to controversy, since the London bookseller Benjamin Motte had publication rights, under English copyright law, {{to many of}} the works included in Faulkner's edition. The English, in 1735, attempted to pass <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow a copyright holder to prohibit works that may violate their copyright, but this law failed to pass through Parliament.|$|E
5|$|A senator {{could make}} a brief statement, discuss the matter in detail, or talk about an {{unrelated}} topic. All senators had to speak before a vote could be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator could talk a proposal to death (a filibuster or diem consumere) if they could keep the debate going until nightfall. It is known, for example, that the senator Cato the Younger once filibustered {{in an attempt to}} prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have given land to the veterans of Pompey.|$|E

5|$|On January 18, 1977, the Dade County Commission {{approved}} <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> outlaw {{discrimination on}} the basis of sexual orientation in employment, housing, and public services. Commissioner Ruth Shack proposed the bill on December 7, 1976 at the request of a gay lobbying organization, named the Dade County Coalition for the Humanistic Rights of Gays, that was less than a year old. The group was headed by three gay activists: Jack Campbell, an owner of 40gay bathhouses across the United States, political and gay activist Bob Basker, and Bob Kunst, a local publicist and enthusiast of the Human Potential Movement.|$|E
5|$|The law was {{a second}} attempt by Senator Yee to enact {{restrictions}} for video game sales to minors. Yee's background as a child psychologist led him to assert there was a connection between video games and violence and believed {{that the government had}} strong interest in restricting video game sales to minors as was already done for pornographic works. In 2004, Yee had drafted <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have required mature-rated video games to be stocked separately from other titles. Though the bill ultimately passed as CA Law AB 1793, the bill's language was diluted at its passage, only requiring stores to display the ESRB ratings system and provide information to parents about it.|$|E
5|$|In April 1995, the State Duma {{considered}} {{the first draft}} of <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have established a State Medical Commission with a psychiatrist to certify the competence of the President, the Prime Minister, and high federal political officials to fulfill the responsibilities of their positions. In 2002, Ukrainian psychiatrist Ada Korotenko stated that today the question was raised about the use of psychiatry to settle political accounts and establish psychiatric control over people competing for power in the country. Obviously, one will find supporters of the feasibility of such a filter, she said, though is it worthwhile to substitute experts' medical reports for elections? In 2003, the suggestion of using psychiatry to prevent and dismiss officials from their positions was supported by Alexander Podrabinek, author of the book Punitive Medicine, a 265-page monograph covering political abuses of psychiatry in the Soviet Union. He suggested that people who seek high positions or run for the legislature should bring from the psychiatric dispensary a reference that they are not on the psychiatric registry and should be subjected to psychiatric examination in the event of inappropriate behavior. Concerned about the problem, authorities ruled that the Russian Mental Health Law should not be applied to senior officials and the judiciary on the ground that they are vested with parliamentary or judicial immunity. A psychiatrist who violates this rule can be deprived of his diploma and sentenced to imprisonment. In 2011, Russian psychiatrists again tried to promote the idea that one's marked aspiration in itself for power can be referred to psychopathic symptoms and that there are statistics about 60 percent of current leaders of states suffering from various forms of mental abnormalities.|$|E

5|$|President Carlos Menem {{sought a}} {{constitutional}} amendment to allow his re-election, and Alfonsín opposed it. The victory in the 1993 midterm elections strengthened the PJ, which approved the bill in the Senate. Menem proposed a referendum on the amendment, to force the radical deputies to support it. He also proposed a bill for <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow {{a constitutional amendment}} with a simple majority of the Congress. As a result, Alfonsín made the Pact of Olivos with him. With this agreement, the UCR would support Menem's proposal, but with further amendments that would reduce presidential power. The Council of Magistrates of the Nation reduced the influence of the executive power over the judiciary, the city of Buenos Aires would become an autonomous territory allowed to elect its own mayor, and the presidential term of office would be reduced to four years. The presidential elections would include the two-round system, and the electoral college would be abolished. Alfonsín was elected to the constituent assembly that worked for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. A faction of the UCR, led by Fernando delaRúa, opposed the pact, but the party as a whole supported Alfonsín. The UCR got only 19% of the vote in the elections, attaining third position in the 1995 presidential elections behind the Frepaso, when Menem was re-elected. Alfonsín resigned the presidency of the party in that year.|$|E

Two years later, in 2009, Donnelly supported <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> concealed carry reciprocity across state lines.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, a Quaker {{group in}} the United States drafted <b>a</b> {{prototype}} <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow conscientious objectors to pay their taxes to UNICEF instead of to the U.S. Treasury.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> new <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{bring the}} HSYK {{directly}} {{under the control of}} the Ministry of Justice was passed on 1 February 2014 despite several breakouts of violence between government and opposition MPs.|$|R

25|$|Speaking {{through a}} surrogate, Obama called for Blagojevich's {{resignation}} on December 10. Had Blagojevich resigned or {{been removed from}} office before making the appointment, the duty would have fallen to Illinois Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn, who would succeed Blagojevich as governor. However, Illinois Senate president Emil Jones {{said that he would}} call the Senate back into session to write <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> result in Obama's replacement being determined in a special election.|$|E
25|$|The Argentine Constitution of 1853, in clause 11 {{of article}} 67, {{authorized}} the Argentine National Congress {{to draw up}} the Civil, Commercial, Penal and Mining Codes. With the intent of fulfilling this constitutional mandate, Facundo Zuviría brought before the Senate <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> empower the Executive Branch to appoint a commission to complete those tasks. The law was passed and signed by Urquiza, but for financial reasons the initiative was postponed.|$|E
25|$|During the 20th century, several {{efforts were}} made to declare Florida as a municipality. First, on April 14, 1949, House Representative Francisco Díaz Marchand {{presented}} a project to create a legislative commission that would study the economic and social conditions of the barrio, to determine the suitability of it as an independent municipality. The project was unsuccessful. On 1960, Manuel Frías Morales presented <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> permit the study to establish the municipality but it didn't succeed either.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, the Scottish Parliament debated <b>a</b> similar <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{apply to}} shops in Scotland. The law was enacted in 2007 and it {{contained}} special provisions for New Year's Day retail activities too.|$|R
50|$|Al-Turabi also {{laid out}} his vision for <b>a</b> Sharia <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be applied {{gradually}} instead of forcefully and would apply only to Muslims, who would share power with the Christians in a federal system.|$|R

25|$|In 1965, Williams began {{pressing}} for <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> require a mandatory retirement age of 65 for all elected officials. Though mandatory retirement was never enacted, Williams announced in 1969 {{that he would}} not seek a fifth term in the U.S. Senate. On December 31, 1970, he resigned from the Senate just before the end of his term, allowing his protégé, newly elected Republican William V. Roth, Jr., to gain additional seniority in his new class of U.S. Senators.|$|E
25|$|The major flaw of {{this law}} was {{that it could be}} used only when the {{majority}} of municipal councils in a province petitioned for it. Since landowners usually controlled such councils, no province ever asked that the law be applied. Therefore, Quezon ordered that the act be mandatory in all Central Luzon provinces. However, contracts were good for only one year. By simply refusing to renew their contract, landlords were able to eject tenants. As a result, peasant organizations clamored in vain for <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> make the contract automatically renewable {{for as long as the}} tenants fulfilled their obligations.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Kahane's Kach party again {{ran for the}} Knesset {{during the}} 1981 elections, {{but it did not}} win a seat, {{receiving}} only 5,128 votes. In 1984, the Central Elections Committee banned him from being a candidate on the grounds that Kach was a racist party, but the Supreme Court of Israel overturned the ban on grounds that the committee was not authorized to ban Kahane's candidacy. The Supreme Court suggested that the Knesset pass <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> authorize the exclusion of racist parties from future elections, and the Anti-Racist Law of 1988 was later passed.|$|E
50|$|In January 2015 the 2015 Congolese protests {{broke out}} in the country's capital {{following}} the release of <b>a</b> draft <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> extend the presidential term limits and allow Joseph Kabila to run again for office.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, Deuell co-authored {{legislation}} <b>that</b> <b>would</b> require abortion {{providers to}} abide by the same regulations as ambulatory surgical centers.

50|$|Colorado Referendum I was <b>a</b> {{proposed}} <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{have established}} domestic partnerships in the U.S. state of Colorado.

25|$|On 11 November, the Malaysian {{government}} briefly detained {{de facto}} opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim on Tuesday and arrested {{a human rights}} lawyer and about a dozen opposition leaders, amid growing complaints {{that the government was}} cracking down on dissent. Dozens of policemen blocked the main entrance to the parliament building in Kuala Lumpur to foil an opposition-led rally. The rally was carried out along with the attempt to submit a protest note to Parliament over a government-backed plan to amend <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> extend the tenure of the Election Commission chief, whom the opposition claims is biased.|$|E
25|$|Desperate {{to avoid}} formal {{sanctions}} {{and to get}} off the FATF blacklist, the BSP spearheaded another lobby, this time to legislate <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> criminalize money-laundering and create an anti-money-laundering body, as required by the FATF. The process, however, proved to be more complicated than anticipated. Buenaventura was repeatedly attacked by irate congressmen, who accused the BSP of attempting to amass power that would allow it to poke into the private accounts of individuals it considered suspicious. Legislators did not want the BSP peeking into private accounts, fearing that such power would be used as a political tool to ferret out ill-gotten wealth that was being laundered through banks.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Buenaventura became central bank governor, over fifteen {{percent of the}} total loan {{portfolio}} of the entire banking sector was considered non-performing loans. Within the next year, this peaked at seventeen percent. The need to unload these bad loans before they collapsed the industry spurred the BSP-led lobby for the Special Purpose Vehicles Act, <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow banks to sell their bad loans at a discount to companies that specialized in taking over bad loans and turning them around. Carefully orchestrating the lobby before both houses of Congress, Buenaventura led the efforts for the passage of the law, telling lawmakers that the banking industry needed the flexibility since the government did not have the resources to launch its own rescue efforts.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, {{and again}} in 2007, the SDS-led {{government}} proposed the regulation {{of the status of}} the [...] "erased" [...] by <b>a</b> Constitutional <b>law</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> treat each case individually. On both occasions, this compromise was rejected by the centre-left opposition.|$|R
