In {{its highest}} trim specification, the LS 430 {{included}} Lexus Link telematics, power door and trunk closers, heated and cooled front seats, and power reclining massage rear seats equipped with audio controls, power sunshade, a cooler, and <b>air</b> <b>purifier.</b> Several rear seat features adopted for the LS 430 {{had been previously}} available in Japanese market luxury vehicles. Safety features added to the LS 430 included front and rear side curtain airbags, park sensors, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and electronic brakeforce distribution. The vehicle also gained water repellent windshield and side glass.|$|E
25|$|The updated 2010 model {{also has}} an {{optional}} limited-slip differential and TRD-tuned exhaust system on SE trim. Features include an optional ion <b>air</b> <b>purifier</b> type filtration system. For 2010, a backup camera became optional on the SE and XLE trims. The new 2.5-liter straight-4 engines replace the previous 2.4-liter four-cylinder in non-hybrid models. A more powerful version is exclusive to the Camry SE, and Toyota's Smart Key System is now available for the SE (previously only available to the XLE).|$|E
25|$|<b>Air</b> <b>purifier</b> sales shot {{up during}} the hazy period. Best Denki, an {{electronic}} store, sold S$350,000 worth of air purifiers and related items in 4 days, a 300 percent increase. However, experts from the Institute of Environmental Science & Engineering at the Nanyang Technological University said that only some of these products, like High Efficiency Particulate air filters, would effectively remove small particles from air. Other kinds of air purifiers like ionizing purifiers gave off ozone which could cause symptoms similar to those caused by the haze. The experts recommended regularly cleaning the filter media and opening windows to get some fresh air at night.|$|E

2500|$|In the U.S., air purifiers {{emitting}} {{low levels}} of ozone have been sold. This kind of <b>air</b> <b>purifier</b> is sometimes claimed to imitate nature's way of purifying the air without filters and to sanitize both it and household surfaces. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has declared that there is [...] "evidence to show that at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone is not effective at removing many odor-causing chemicals" [...] or [...] "viruses, bacteria, mold, or other biological pollutants". Furthermore, its report states that [...] "results of some controlled studies show that concentrations of ozone considerably higher than these [...] standards are possible even when a user follows the manufacturer’s operating instructions".|$|E

50|$|As {{with other}} {{health-related}} appliances, there is controversy surrounding {{the claims of}} certain companies, especially involving ionic <b>air</b> <b>purifiers.</b> Many <b>air</b> <b>purifiers</b> generate some ozone, an energetic allotrope of three oxygen atoms, and {{in the presence of}} humidity, small amounts of NOx. Because {{of the nature of the}} ionization process, ionic <b>air</b> <b>purifiers</b> tend to generate the most ozone. This is a serious concern, because ozone is a criteria air pollutant regulated by health-related US federal and state standards. In a controlled experiment, in many cases, ozone concentrations were well in excess of public and/or industrial safety levels established by US Environmental Protection Agency, particularly in poorly ventilated rooms.|$|R

5000|$|Plate {{precipitators}} {{are commonly}} marketed {{to the public}} as <b>air</b> <b>purifier</b> devices or as a permanent replacement for furnace filters, but all have the undesirable attribute of being somewhat messy to clean.
