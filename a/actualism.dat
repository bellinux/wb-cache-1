50|$|Honderich's {{theory of}} {{consciousness}} {{in the long}} book Actual Consciousness and the precis-book Your Being Conscious is What? Where? replaces entirely his philosophy of mind in A Theory of Determinism: The Mind, Neuroscience and Life-Hopes and the precis-book How Free Are You?. The new theory derives from a database {{to the effect that}} being conscious, figuratively speaking, is something's being actual. This issues, by way of (a) speculation that disagreement about consciousness is significantly owed to no adequate initial clarification of the subject matter, and (b) examination of five leading ideas of consciousness and existing theories of consciousness, and (c) a specification of the objective physical world, into the wholly literal theory or analysis of the nature of consciousness called <b>Actualism.</b> It distinguishes three sides of consciousness: (1) perceptual consciousness -- consciousness in perception, (2) cognitive consciousness, and (3) affective consciousness. In each case the theory satisfies the two primary criteria of explaining what is actual, and what its being actual consists in. In the case of perceptual consciousness what is actual is only a subjective physical world out there. I.e. being perceptually conscious is essentially or primarily a state of affairs external to the perceiver. Its being actual is its being subjectively physical, which is specified. In the case of cognitive and affective consciousness, what is actual is representations, internal to the conscious thing, and their being actual is their being subjectively physical, differently so from subjective physical worlds. <b>Actualism</b> argues, further, that it satisfies further criteria better than other existing theories of consciousness including one of subjectivity, individuality or personal identity, and that it is relevant to desires for human standing that are the motivation of beliefs in free will as against determinism. <b>Actualism</b> has been received as a new and arguabletheory by philosophers who have previously declared the urgent need for one. A predecessor of the theory is discussed by 11 others philosophers in Radical Externalism: Honderich's Theory of Consciousness Discussed, ed. Anthony Freeman, Imprint Academic.|$|E

[...] On Lewis's account, the actual world is identified with the physical universe of which we are all a part.

Hence, for Lewis, [...] "merely possible" [...] entities—entities that exist in other possible worlds—exist in exactly the same sense as do we in the actual world; to be actual, from the perspective of any given individual x in any possible world, is simply {{to be part of the}} same world as x.|$|E

5000|$|Jenson {{finally left}} Luther College to spend {{three years as}} Dean and Tutor of Lutheran Studies at Mansfield College, Oxford University. Here {{he was able to}} focus {{for the first time on}} {{teaching}} theology, and he was deeply influenced by his encounters with Anglicanism and with ecumenical worship. The three years at Oxford marked a creative and productive period in Jenson's career. In The Knowledge of Things Hoped For (1969), he sought to integrate the traditions of European hermeneutics and English analytical philosophy, while also drawing on patristic and medieval theologians such as Origen and Thomas Aquinas. And in God after God (1969), he sought to go beyond the [...] "death of God" [...] theology by emphasizing the <b>actualism</b> and futurity of God's being. The proposal advanced in God after God was in many respects parallel to the new [...] "theology of hope" [...] that was being developed at the time in Germany by young scholars like Jürgen Moltmann and Wolfhart Pannenberg. At Oxford, Jenson also supervised the doctoral work of Colin Gunton, who went on to become one of Great Britain's most distinguished and influential systematic theologians.|$|E
5000|$|Therefore, Gentile {{proposed}} {{a form of}} what he called [...] "absolute Immanentism" [...] in which the divine was the present conception of reality in the totality of one's individual thinking as an evolving, growing and dynamic process. Many times accused of solipsism, Gentile maintained his philosophy to be a Humanism that sensed the possibility of nothing beyond what was colligate in perception; the self's human thinking, in order to communicate as immanence is to be human like oneself, made a cohesive empathy of the self-same, without an external division, and therefore not modeled as objects to one's own thinking. Whereas solipsism would feel trapped in realization of its solitude, <b>actualism</b> rejects such a privation and is an expression of the only freedom which is possible within objective contingencies, where the transcendental Self does not even exist as an object, and the dialectical co-substantiation of others necessary to understand the empirical self are felt as true others when found to be the unrelativistic subjectivity of that whole self and essentially unified with the spirit of such higher self in actu, where others can be truly known, rather than thought as windowless monads.|$|E
50|$|The {{issue is}} {{illustrated}} by an example from Smith/Goldman’s later paper “Doing the Best One Can”. A graduate student asks faculty member S for comments on a paper he plans to present at a job interview. If S agrees and comments on the paper, the student will improve the paper substantially, have a highly successful interview, and receive an offer for a three-year job. If S accepts the task but fails {{to comment on the}} paper in time, the student will make no revisions, have a dismal interview, and receive no job offer. If S declines to provide comments, the student will elicit comments from a less expert faculty member, make less helpful revisions on the paper, have a moderately successful interview, and receive a one-year job offer. Clearly S’s accepting the task would enable her to follow the ideal course of action, namely reading and commenting on the paper in a timely way, resulting in the student’s receiving a three-year job. However, in reality if S accepted the task, she would actually fail to comment on the paper in time, either because she would misunderstand the deadline, or because she of her time-consuming administrative chores. In this case the student would receive no job offer. Possibilism recommends that S agree to comment, that would support her intent to follow the best course of action. <b>Actualism</b> takes a more realistic stance: it recommends that S decline since that would lead to a better outcome. Smith argues this case requires the same reasoning as a prudential decision, such as deciding to drive carefully to avoid a crash.|$|E
40|$|Uniformitarian geology {{has opposed}} biblical history {{for over two}} centuries. Most creationist critiques focus on {{contrary}} empirical evidence, but this series pursues a logical and axiomatic critique of the “four-definition ” formulation of uniformitarianism. Three of these facets—stasis, gradualism, and generic uniformity—fail to support the concept. The remaining “uniformity of process, ” also called <b>actualism,</b> seems on the surface to work well, but can be addressed by seeking justification of its use as an axiom of natural history. <b>Actualism</b> rests on uniformity, and uniformity in turn on causal continuity. These concepts can be evaluated relative to the worldviews of Christianity and Naturalism by the truth test of coherence. Naturalism fails that test, but Christianity passes because causal continuity is coherent with—and only with—Christianity’s God. As a theological issue, uniformity and <b>actualism</b> are best understood as physical expressions of divine providence.

Though often confused with uniformity and uniformitarianism due to secular obfuscation, <b>actualism,</b> at root, is a method of geology that limits historical processes and events to observed present-day causes. <b>Actualism</b> fails as an absolute explanation of historical causality: it cannot be precisely defined, it surreptitiously assumes unjustified metaphysical positions, and its secular formulations fail logical and empirical truth tests. Only when justified as a contingent manifestation of providence does it avoid these problems.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the technical implications of a certain view connecting existence to predication. This is the view that in no possible world is there a genuine relation among the nonexistents of that world or between the nonexistents and the existents! The meaning of the term ‘genuine ’ here may be variously explained. On an extreme interpretation, all relations are ‘genuine’, so that none of them are to relate non-existents. On a milder interpretation, the genuine relations are those that are simple or primitive in some absolute sense. But even without appeal to an absolute concept of simplicity, we can require that all relations should be analyzable in terms of some suitable set of relations, relating only existents to existents. In order to make our results applicable to the thesis, we shall suppose that the primitive non-logical predicates of our language correspond to the genuine relations, whatever they might be taken to be. Thus, the linguistic formulation of the thesis becomes that the primitive predicates of the language should only be true, in each world, of the existents of that world. Of course, the thesis might have been given a linguistic formulation, without any reference to relations, in the first place. The thesis is an instance of what has been called <b>Actualism.</b> This is the ontological doctrine that ascribes a special status to actual or existent objects. Another form of the doctrine, so-called World <b>Actualism,</b> says that the behaviour of nonexistents is supervenient upon the behaviour of the existents, that two possible worlds which agree in the latter respect cannot differ in the former respect. The present thesis, by contrast, might be called Redicate Acrualism. It should be clear that Predicate <b>Actualism</b> implies World <b>Actualism,</b> at least if the predicates used to describe the world are to express ‘genuine ’ relations; for then there are no relationships involving non-existents by which two worlds might be distinguished. On the other hand, World <b>Actualism</b> does not, as it stands, imply Predicate <b>Actualism.</b> For our purposes, it will be useful to distinguish two versions of th...|$|E

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{defend the}} non-contingency of objecthood: whatever is something is necessarily something; whatever {{there could have}} been is actually something. My defence begins by establishing that the non-contingency of objecthood is connected to the Barcan Formulas of first-order modal logic: the latter are valid schemas exactly if objecthood is non-contingent. Furthermore, the Barcan Formulas are themselves theorems of a particularly attractive system of first-order modal logic. Nevertheless, the presence of intuitive inform al counter-examples raises doubts over their form al validity. Since questions of validity are most naturally investigated in the formal semantics, 1 note that although firs t-order modal logic with the Barcan Formulas is correct over an attractively simple class of models, Kripke famously identified models on which they are untrue. Nevertheless, I argue that the existence of such models fails undermine the thought that that Barcan Formulas are valid on their intended interpretations. I diagnose this failure as resulting from the use in Kripke's semantics of a non-modal meta-language in which facts about validity' for modal logic are reduced to non-modal facts. Although this reduction is wholly warranted in terms of advancing the technical study of modal logics. it is inadequate to the ambition of explaining the alleged invalidity of the Barcan Formulas. This motivates the thought that a more homophonic sort of semantics for modal logic might be a better tool to adjudicate the dispute. I develop a natural homophonic semantics for first-order modal logic and argue that it validates the Barcan Fonnulas. A modification to this theory designed to avoid this consequence is found unacceptable. This completes the logical case for the non-contingency of objecthood. In the remainder of the dissertation I consider how the Barcan Formulas interact with some other issues in modal metaphysics. First, I consider whether they are incompatible with <b>Actualism,</b> the much espoused view that everything actually exists. I argue that on the relevant reading of 'exists' <b>Actualism</b> is itself a logical truth, with the result that it offers no constraint on theories in modal metaphysics. Fin ally, I consider Predication <b>Actualism,</b> the view that objects cannot have properties without existing. I argue that only with ad hoc restrictions on the logic of predicate abstraction can one combine this view with the denial of the Barcan Formulas; and that further difficulties for this combination emerge when Predication <b>Actualism</b> is formulated in second order modal logic.
