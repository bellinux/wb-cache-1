5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.holopus. <b>A</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a pinkish color, but has no reaction with the flesh. <b>A</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) has no reaction on the cap surface, and either no reaction or a brownish reaction with the flesh. Application of iron (II) sulphate solution does not have a reaction on the cap surface, and either no reaction to slightly olive coloration on the flesh.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.rugosiceps. <b>A</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a reddish color or is unreactive, and yellow or unreactive on the flesh. <b>A</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) turns the cap surface red, and the flesh yellowish to orangish.

5|$|Chemical {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or morphologically similar species of mushrooms, or, in some cases, as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. Pigments {{present in the}} fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, and the color reactions {{may be used as}} taxonomic characters. When <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide is applied to the cap of B.mirabilis, the tissue turns a fleeting pink color that fades away. If <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> commercial bleach (calcium hypochlorite) is applied, the tissue loses its color and becomes a pale blue.|$|E

5|$|An ideal {{surface is}} flat, rigid, {{perfectly}} smooth, and chemically homogeneous, and has zero contact angle hysteresis. Zero hysteresis implies the advancing and receding contact angles are equal. In other words, only one thermodynamically stable contact angle exists. When <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> liquid {{is placed on}} such a surface, the characteristic contact angle is formed as depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, on an ideal surface, the drop will return to its original shape if it is disturbed. The following derivations apply only to ideal solid surfaces; they are only valid for the state in which the interfaces are not moving and the phase boundary line exists in equilibrium.|$|E

5|$|By 1929, the {{phenomenon}} of beta decay prompted Bohr to again suggest that the law of conservation of energy be abandoned, but Enrico Fermi's hypothetical neutrino and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the neutron provided another explanation.

In this model, the nucleus could be deformed like <b>a</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> liquid. He worked on this with a new collaborator, the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar, who died suddenly in 1938.|$|E
