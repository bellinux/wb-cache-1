40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to investigate possible alternatives to monocropped maize {{for the production of}} biogas. The strategy of double-cropping for the production of biogas substrates is addressed by degradation experiments with maize as the standard crop and the two alternative crops sunflower and sorghum-sudangrass. Biological degradation experiments were made in biogas batch reactors for all three crops in each maturity stage. The remaining material was analysed for different chemical parameters to determine the degree of degradation of and their influence on biogas production. As the second {{objective of}} this thesis the investigation of an <b>alternative</b> <b>farming</b> <b>practice</b> to monoculture of maize was tried out. Mixed crop experiments with maize and climbing beans were conducted at three research sites in over the course of 3 years. One site was managed under organic conditions and two under conventional conditions. In all research sites treatments with different seeding density and seeding time of beans were tested. Additionally different weed regulation methods were tested. In all research sites also the influence of weed coverage on total yield was measured. Moreover the biogas potential of a mixture of climbing bean and maize was measured based on artificially mixed crop-silages. The silages were made with varying proportions of maize and bean. The chemical parameters from all silages were analysed and verified for influences on biogas production potential...|$|E

These activities will allow the hydrological characteristics of the river to be matched to crop-livestock systems of flood recession agriculture that are well suited to the study communities and their organizational and institutional frameworks in order to support sustainable growth of such systems. This detailed study will provide recommendations on the technical, economic, institutional and policy measures needed to achieve sustainable intensification of flood recession agriculture in northern Ghana, while complementing efforts undertaken to promote other types of water management systems. Options for out-scaling of flood recession agriculture beyond the study area to other suitable areas will also be explored. The expectation is that the proposed project will improve food security by enhancing knowledge on effective flood recession practices, enhance rural incomes through expanded dry-season farming with new opportunities for rural employment, and improve adaptation to climate change by building more resilient farming communities. To achieve these expected outcomes, proactive policies that clearly identify flood recession agriculture as an <b>alternative</b> <b>farming</b> <b>practice</b> and provide institutional mandates to irrigation support services to promote it through training, demonstration, and outreach programs will be equally valuable.

40|$|Currently {{alternative}} agricultural systems, like organic farming, {{that are}} less chemical intensive, less exploitative and that can conserve the environment are gaining popularity. Tuber crops, especially aroids, like elephant foot yam, respond well to organic manures and offer scope for organic production. However, lack of package of practices recommendations hinders the promotion of this viable <b>alternative</b> <b>farming</b> <b>practice.</b> Hence, the organic farming technology for elephant foot yam developed at CTCRI was validated through on farm trials under State Horticulture Mission funded programme. Demonstration trials were conducted during 2008 - 2009 in 10 farmers’ sites to cover an area of 5 ha in Kollam and Pathanamthitta districts of Kerala to compare the yield, quality, economics and soil fertility under the organic management practices with the existing farmers’ practice and conventional practice (present package of practices recommendations) in elephant foot yam. Organic farming resulted in higher corm yield (34. 60 t ha- 1) and additional income (Rs. 43, 651 ha- 1) over conventional farming. Organically produced corms had significantly higher dry matter and Mg contents and significantly lower oxalate content. The chemical properties of the soil, especially K, were also seen favoured under organic farming. The organic farming technology standardized for elephant foot yam includes the application of farmyard manure (FYM) @ 36 t ha- 1, green manuring with cowpea to generate 20 - 25 t ha- 1 of green matter in 45 - 60 days, neem cake @ 1 t ha- 1 and ash @ 3 t ha- 1.

The difficulty with “sustainable agriculture” is that there is much disagreement as to what it entails and how to approach it. Thus far, the organic movement has dominated practices and perceptions in the realm of <b>alternative</b> <b>farming</b> <b>practices.</b> Proponents of organic food production claim that it is more beneficial for the environment, as well as the humans and animals that inhabit it. However, some research has shown that organic food production can be more resource intensive and have a larger effect on the environment than conventional methods. At its conception, the organic food movement was associated with a production process that was small scale, environmentally friendly, and socially conscious; but, modern organic food production has been industrialized and now involves many of the same processes as the conventional food production system it set out to oppose. The consensus among the literature is that organic, as it is defined in any regulatory or certification system, is not inherently sustainable. The sustainability of organic depends on factors other than specific processes defined by organic legislation, including regional climate, pre-cultivation soil conditions, distribution techniques, access to fresh water, topography, and other site specific <b>alternative</b> <b>farming</b> <b>practices</b> used in a given organic system (zero tillage, crop diversification, closed nutrient cycling, local sourcing, these are practices not defined or prohibited in organic laws).

However, continuous over-mining {{of natural resources and}} unsustainable <b>farm</b> <b>practices</b> leads to degradation of ecological health resulting in negative externalities primarily soil erosion, flooding, pollution, and silt loading of the water ecosystems. To reverse ecosystem degradation trends, conservation-livelihood enhancement tools like PES have been initiated as an alternative for watershed conservation through incentive mechanisms to farmers (Nyongesa 2011). Nonetheless, farmers are used to traditional <b>farming</b> <b>practices,</b> and to transform to sustainable PES interventions, their understanding of trade-off between current and <b>alternative</b> <b>farm</b> <b>practices,</b> value of ecosystem services, and the expected benefits from alternative practices is imperative. The assumption is that farmers will accept pay to forego unsustainable current traditional <b>farm</b> <b>practices</b> if and only if they are convinced that the new bundle of practices will provide more benefits including increased productivity and income and improved agro-ecosystem condition. Some of the unsustainable <b>farm</b> <b>practices</b> in study sites include farming on high-gradient and riparian areas leading to increased soil erosion, overuse of agro-chemicals causing pollution, slash and burn of vegetation cover, cultivation across contours, and continuous cultivation of same land, reducing nutrient recycling. These practices accelerate degradation of agricultural ecosystem with negative significant impact on ecosystem services (Kitaka et al. 2002).

40|$|Most {{collective}} agroecological {{initiatives in}} Europe today are {{built around a}} plurality of knowledge systems. Going beyond the well-documented instrumental goals of this knowledge-plurality, this paper highlights another, perhaps less obvious objective: the pursuit of recognition and cognitive justice. The subordination of <b>alternative</b> <b>farming</b> <b>practices,</b> such as agroecology, to industrial high-input farming leads to the misrecognition of peasant communities. Challenging industrial agriculture hence requires both equality between different forms of doing farming and an active engagement with different ways of knowing farming. Cognitive justice, a concept originating in decolonial thought, encompasses not only the right of different practices to co-exist, but entails an active engagement across their knowledge-systems. Using an example of participatory maize breeding in France, the paper illustrates how peasant movements in Europe organize an 'agroecology of knowledges', a counter-hegemonic engagement with modern agronomic science, through the recovery and co-production of situational, environment-specific knowledge, and the reskilling of farmers. It aims not only at improving agricultural science, but also at rebuilding collective identities and reclaiming autonomy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Traditional low-yield farming systems, while being promoted by environmental groups, have resulted in massive famine, higher cancer rates, soil erosion, and losses in wildlife habitat. Organic farming and other low-yield systems are land intensive and invade marginal farmland, thereby destroying wildlife habitat and biodiversity. Low-yield farming has not and cannot produce enough food to meet the food needs of the world’s population. By contrast, high-yield farming minimizes land use for food production and increase the availability of land for wildlife habitat and biodiversity. High-yield farming has contributed to economic development and lower birth rates, thereby reducing population growth. The environment risks from high-yield farming are considered low and have been declining. The benefits of high-yield farming can be maximized with agricultural research and free trade in farm products.

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this study was to find out whether changes in social action or social {{practices}} are predicated on, or correspond with changes in ontological assumptions and social normative structures or ethical orientations. Specifically, this study investigated the relationship between a range of <b>farming</b> <b>practices</b> and the two predominant ontological assumptions about human-nature relationship. As well, the study investigated the relationship between the range of <b>farming</b> <b>practices</b> and categories of environmental ethical orientations. The two ontological orientations include the 'externality' assumption, which represent the social understanding that humans interact with nature but are only externally related to nature. The 'internality' assumption, on the other hand, is the understanding that humans are internally related to nature or the physical environment. The study also investigated the role of other structural forces that can shape <b>farming</b> <b>practices.</b> The theoretical orientation that informed this study was Habermas' neo-modernity thesis, which primarily argues that changes in social normative structures, which induces appropriate social action can, and do develop, without changes in ontological assumptions about human-nature relationship. The Habermasian approach thus rejects the reenchantment thesis espoused by constructive postmodernists. In this study Habermas' thesis has been contrasted with the neo-conservative and postmodernist approaches. The study involved two forms of investigation. One aspect of the study involved archival research of Canadian agricultural policy as an overarching background against which contemporary <b>farming</b> <b>practices</b> may be understood. The other aspect of the study involved a survey of farm families living in the south western Saskatchewan section of the Palliser Triangle.

30|$|Many {{studies have}} applied {{willingness}} to pay (WTP) approaches to estimate farmers’ opportunity cost for <b>alternative</b> <b>farm</b> <b>practices</b> to increase productivity (Ulimwengu and Prabuddha 2011), when farmers have knowledge on agricultural products or ecosystem services prices. Our survey however valued ecosystem services based on willingness to accept pay (WTA) estimation approach premised on producer surplus concept. The WTA was modeled as opportunity cost to allow for farm restriction to maintain or increase agricultural productivity and rehabilitate landscapes for provision of ESs by sellers of ecosystem services. The WTA is more applicable to farmers selling the ES as opposed to WTP which would be more relevant for beneficiaries of ecosystem services (buyers of ecosystem services for Naivasha PES case). Likewise, contingent valuation method was applied in this study as non-market valuation technique which estimates benefits derived from ecosystem services (Carson and Groves 2007). Contingent methods utilizes stated preference techniques and are useful in assessment of ecosystem services valuation within total economic value (TEV) framework (DEFRA 2007) including use value (direct and indirect) and non-use value (bequest and altruistic value). The contingent valuation (CV) flexibility and strength to estimate total values allow estimates related to ecosystem services possible (Hanemann 1989, 1994).|$|R

Results suggest that lower application of fertilizer under the low-disturbance seeding-system provides better yields, net benefits, and net carbon fixed than the high-disturbance system for both crops.

Because agroforestry is outside main stream commodity production in US agriculture, {{the purpose is}} to evaluate a framework to understand attitudes. The framework incorporates Pierre Bourdieu's notions of "habitus" and "field" along with individual economic and demographic characteristics of farm operators' traditionally used in adoption studies. Four attitudes are analyzed: disengagers, conservatives, lifestyle, and accumulators. A Logit regression measures the effects of respondents' attitudes, and other internal and external factors to assess interest in each practice. The data used is from a household survey of 364 farm-operators from the Fox Wyaconda watershed in northeast Missouri and Scott County in southeast Missouri gathered in 1999. Findings show that a conservative or a lifestyle attitude, are significant, with high probability of being interested in riparian buffers. Those with an accumulator or a lifestyle attitude have a significant and high probability of being interested in forest farming. Other variables also significant in riparian buffer interest are knowledge of agroforestry, and interest in <b>alternative</b> <b>farming</b> <b>practices,</b> and especially having perceptions of erosion problems.

The ecosystem degradation however threatens sustainability of this potential necessitating {{the need to develop}} market-based conservation-livelihood enhancement PES farm interventions. The PES incentive mechanism strengthens business relationship between local community’s as ecosystem stewards upstream and beneficiaries of ecosystem services downstream through co-investment in good watershed management. Our research underscores WTA estimates and its underlying socio-economic determining factors under PES scheme in Lake Naivasha basin. We argue that the PES scheme has a potential to restore degraded agro-ecosystems and contribute to sustainable socio-economic development. Rehabilitation of landscapes is essential for the provision of ecosystem services, and PES is a potential tool through which economic valuation of ecosystem services can be assessed. We applied contingent valuation to estimate farmers WTA and Logit regression to model socio-economic factors influencing WTA to implement PES practices. Our study results demonstrate that different PES interventions can be applied as <b>alternative</b> sustainable <b>farm</b> <b>practices</b> to mitigate watershed negative externalities. We have shown that most farmers are willing to continue participating in PES scheme and are willing to accept pay as incentive in monetary form to implement PES <b>farm</b> <b>practices</b> relative to the current flat rate pay of Kshs. 1700 (US$ 17) to mitigate degradation on their agricultural lands. We demonstrate that estimation of farmers WTA is a potential tool to attach economic value to ecosystem services as public non-rivalry goods and services to influence adoption of PES conservation <b>farm</b> <b>practices</b> vital for restoration of degraded landscapes. Acceptance of pay further confirms willingness to adopt the PES interventions to reverse the declining farm economic loses and to sustain environmental flows downstream. Significant number of farmers willing to continue participating in PES project implies that PES is a potential alternative policy tool to enhance conservation and livelihoods sustainability. Sustainable provision of ecosystems services is important for socio-economic development benefitting both local communities and private sector. The WTA to implement PES <b>farm</b> <b>practices</b> strengthen business linkages between downstream and upstream stakeholders through co-investment and collective responsibility in watershed management. Nevertheless, farmers are heterogeneous in their tastes and preference, which relates to socio-economic farm characteristics that influence WTA to implement <b>alternative</b> PES <b>farm</b> <b>practices.</b> This study revealed socio-economic factors including education, occupation, acquired skills, land use practice, perception, income, and individual’s interest which significantly determined farmer’s WTA. Findings provide useful information to conservation and development stakeholders to consider socio-economic characteristics when designing similar PES schemes as conservation and livelihood enhancement tools for sustainable adoption in degraded watersheds.|$|R

As a result of these concerns, increased attention has been given to <b>alternative</b> <b>farming</b> <b>practices</b> in order to decrease the use of fossil fuels, to enhance the efficiency of nitrogen fertilization, and to increase the implementation of conservation tillage practices. Farmers are recommended to include pulse crop into their rotation since legumes form symbiotic associations with bacteria that can fix atmospheric N 2 reducing the need of nitrogen fertilizer application and the emission of greenhouse gas (GHG) production. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the economics of greenhouse gas mitigation for different cropping systems and management practices. Data from a 5 -year study of a wheat-pea rotation, under different seeding systems and fertilizer and herbicide rates, was used to examine economic and greenhouse gas performance.

Comparison of actual measured N 2 O emissions to estimations based on IPCC indicated that the measure emission rate was significantly lower than estimated values for the site. Results for low-fertilizer rates, under a low-disturbance system, suggests there is greater net carbon fixed as compared to the high-disturbance practices in both wheat and pea.

40|$|Systems advocating {{alternative}} agriculture {{would appear to}} be handicapped by the amount and the minutiae of human labour required. Is this really a threat to the continuity of farms associated with these systems? We do not believe that this directly hampers the survival of a farm. We advance the theory that continuity is not just down to chance; the farmer at the time chooses to prolong the life of the farm and more especially to look for a successor. We have shown through a study conducted in central France (Auvergne) that the main guarantee of organisational sustainability, that which sustains the business as a viable entity when another person takes over, is when a farmer thinks of his farm as an entity-cum-project supporting a meaningful life plan. A farmer might also see his farm solely as capital or as heritage, but neither of these last two attitudes is sufficient for him to ensure the spirit of his enterprise is passed on. There is a particularly large number of farmers in the first category (entity-cum-project) who adopt <b>alternative</b> <b>farming</b> <b>practices,</b> which are meaningful. It also {{seems to be the case}} that the manner of working is closely linked to the moral principles of farmers who use alternative systems. Moreover, the same objective amount of work that might be thought excessive in a system that puts strong emphasis on high productivity, is regarded as normal in an alternative system. Farmers often approach extension advisors to help reorganise their working conditions. We maintain that alternative systems have peculiarities with regard to work that make this type of advice difficult. Our aim is to help advisors clearly construct the input they give to the various types of farmers. We put forward a typology of possible practices as regards advice on work, according to assessments farmers have made about the amount of work they do and their way of working. The large number of hours devoted to an <b>alternative</b> <b>farming</b> activity and the nature of that activity, whether demanding or linked to practices thought archaic, are not always a handicap to the continuity of an alternative system.

Because the shrimp supply crisis is growing exponentially, it is the job of countries like the United States, who have resources and technology that less economically developed countries do not, to find a sustainable alternative to the current destructive <b>farming</b> <b>practices</b> that are rapidly damaging ecosystems and endangering human health. In order to pursue this goal of an <b>alternative</b> shrimp <b>farming</b> <b>practice,</b> this paper will seek to provide answers to the problem through research, with particular interest in a new method of growing shrimp that uses indoor tanks and recirculating water to make a zero waste operation that produces domestic, healthy, and safe shrimp in the United States, specifically the Midwest. This research will examine environmental concerns of current shrimp production, health concerns with imported shrimp, global and domestic consumption rates, and recent technology developments. At the conclusion of this research, a business plan for a low resource farmer looking to begin an indoor shrimp farm in Kansas, USA will be provided...|$|R
30|$|PES is a market-based scheme whose {{concept is}} {{based on the premise that}} those who provide {{environmental}} services (managers or sellers) by conserving natural ecosystems are compensated or incentivized by those who benefit from the services (the buyers). The term PES is used broadly aiming at ES enhancement through compensatory or rewards arrangement (van Noordwijk and Leimona (2010). However, Wunder (2005) and Engel et al. (2008) define PES as mechanisms which fits five sets of conditions; a voluntary transaction where, a well-defined environmental service (or land use likely to secure that service), is being “bought” by at least one buyer, from an environmental service provider, if, and only if, the environmental service provider secures environmental service provision (conditionality). The voluntary agreement between sellers and buyers of PES schemes is important, and incentives to farmers motivate them to sustainably adopt <b>alternative</b> PES <b>farm</b> <b>practices</b> (Ruto and Garrod 2009). Nevertheless, compensation or reward for environmental services (CRES) envisages efficient, equitable use and conservation of natural resources through contingent contracts between sellers and buyers of ecosystem services (Swallow et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} ecological {{effects of}} commercial oyster mariculture activities on eelgrass beds (Zostera marina) and estuarine tideflat communities {{are the focus}} of regional concern for several natural resource agencies throughout Washington, Oregon, and northern California. In particular, empirical studies are currently underway at several locations throughout the Pacific Northwest to evaluate <b>alternative</b> shellfish <b>farming</b> <b>practices</b> and develop policies designed to minimize degradation to eelgrass beds and still allow for oyster cultivation on a commercial scale that is profitable to the mariculture industry. Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) have been grown in the intertidal zone of Humboldt Bay, CA for over 60 years, and recent management steps have been taken to discontinue the practices of bottom-culture and harvesting with a mechanical dredge in an effort to reduce damage to eelgrass beds. To further understand the potential ecological effects of off-bottom (long-line) oyster culture on eelgrass communities, we worked in cooperation with the Humboldt Bay- Mariculture Monitoring Committee to establish a series of experimental oyster long-line plots and eelgrass reference areas (controls). The experimental design included evaluation of Best Management Practices (BMPs) for th...|$|R
40|$|Just three American {{magazines}} {{were devoted}} to food in 1973. while today the number has grown exponentially to over thirty. In this research project I {{tell the story of}} why this happened at this particular historical juncture. I am also interested in researching a particular locale. Specifically, this dissertation studies Vancouver foodies in the context of globalized consumer society. "Foodies" is a term used by the media and, grudgingly. by foodies themselves. It denotes people whose identity is partly formed by eating "good food" and by regularly consuming a range of products from cooking magazines to kitchen tools. On the basis of semi-structured interviews with twenty Vancouver area foodies as well as "tours" of their pantries and refrigerators, I discuss foodies 2 ̆ 7 cooking. shopping, eating and reading practices. I also discuss their kitchen fantasies. In addition I analyze a typical issue of two favourite food magazines: Saveur and Bon AppPtit. The primary research question, which organizes the dissertation. asks about the structure of this social group? Is it predominantly a lifestyle formation coming together through leisure pursuits and consumption choices? Is it a taste culture stemming from a certain class fraction? Is it a subculture with alternative values? Or is it simply a target market identified by media and advertisers? Foodies tend to be cultural and social specialists who use cultural forms of distinction over socio-economic forms; in Bourdieu 2 ̆ 7 s terms they use "ostentatious simplicity" instead of conspicuous consumption. For example, their consumption of exotic or expensive regional specialties, like pomegranate molasses and. fleur de Camargue salt, displays their cultural capital. At the same time their consumption of local, artisanallyproduced organic food symbolically resists industrial agribusiness and genetic modification (GM) technology. Core foodies, such as upscale restaurant chefs, are moreover explicitly critical of both and may also be politically active in the organic or slow food movements. Foodies use their support of <b>alternative</b> <b>farming</b> <b>practices</b> as another sign of "culinary capital. " Cultural distinction thus works to reproduce consumerist values as well as to resist them. I explore these tensions at the level of everyday lived experience...|$|R
40|$|Since 1992 agri-environmental {{issues have}} gained {{attention}} by {{reforms of the}} CAP. For instance by supporting environmentally friendly land use, such as permanent pastures in less-favoured areas (LFA) that are only marginally suitable for <b>alternative</b> <b>farming</b> <b>practices.</b> In {{the last two decades}} a significant part of agricultural land in Portugal has been converted to permanent pastures. The question is what role the EU agri-environmental measures (AEM) have played in that development. This paper assesses to which extent AEM have been effective in preserving and promoting permanent pastures and extensive animal production. We investigated two AEM in two research areas: Traditional Mixed Farming (TMF) in Centro and Extensive Grassland (EG) in Alentejo for the implementation period 2005 - 2009. Spatial information was analysed to link plot and farm characteristics with performance (result and impact) indicators such as stocking rate and soil cover (assessed through the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI)). These indicators have been recognized as valuable indicators of AEM effects, and are therefore used in this research. A comparison was made between farms with certain AEMs and farms without these AEMs, that would be eligible for these specific AEMs. The results indicate that the participation in TMF and EG in preserving permanent pastures has been rather low in both regions. Nevertheless, these measures contributed to the upkeep of extensive livestock production with about 65 % of participant farms achieving the expected policy result (maintenance or intensification of livestock keeping), although the effect was only significant in Centro. TMF and EG measures were effective in preserving the number of grazing livestock (goats and sheep, in Centro and Alentejo, respectively). These effects on livestock appeared to be associated with increased vegetation cover on participant farms in Centro, and with a tendency towards maintaining the pre-existing vegetation cover in Alentejo. Our results suggest that although AEM were effective in preserving grazing livestock, changes in grazing practices have not led to a significant improvement of the conditions {{to reduce the risk of}} wildfire and soil erosion. This should be taken into account in the design of new AEMs. </p...|$|R
40|$|The rural landscape, as {{result of}} {{interaction}} between environment and human interventions in the rural sector, depends on the farming activity. In Greece, <b>alternative</b> <b>farming</b> <b>practices,</b> such as organic farming {{could be used in}} order to protect the environment and conserve and improve the rural landscape. The aim of this thesis was to explore differences in the agricultural management between organic and conventional farming in the island of Thassos, where the olive tree cultivation dominates the rural landscape, and to analyse the relationships among organic, conventional farming and the rural landscape. The research was carried out using questionnaires that were completed through personal interviews to conventional and organic farmers. Thassos was divided in three zones – regions (North-western, North-eastern, Southern) based mainly on primary production. Categorical regression was applied for data analysis. By the research it seems that the olive orchards dominate the rural landscape of North-western Thassos, where the land surface is covered by productive farms, located in areas with low slope. In the Southern Thassos, the land surface is covered by olive orchards with low production, located in areas with high slope. In the North-eastern Thassos, where wildfires did not occur in the past, the farms are more productive and located in areas with low slope. The results showed that the impact of organic farming on the landscape by comparison with conventional farming do not differ. The applied <b>practices</b> in organic <b>farms</b> by comparison with conventional farms in Thassos differ substantially only for the control of most important pest, the olive fly. However, the organic farmers’ characteristics (age, educational level, employment, frequency of visiting olive orchards) differ from these of conventional farmers. These characteristics can influence the decisions and actions of farmers who shape the landscape. The research focused on the actions of conventional farmers in three zones – regions of island. The results showed that the influence of the farmers 176 of the North – western Thassos on the landscape is the highest followed by that of the farmers of the North – eastern and Southern Thassos. The decisions and actions of North-western Thassos’ farmers who tend to intensify the farming management and of Southern Thassos’ farmers who tend to abandon their farms, are substantial factors in shaping the landscape. The characteristics and attitudes towards environment and <b>alternative</b> <b>farming</b> systems differed between farmers of North – western and Southern Thassos. Moreover, this work showed that even if it could be easier to convert to organic farming in Southern Thassos, the characteristics and the attitudes of farmers prevent it. The farmers of North-western Thassos adopt easier the principles and <b>practices</b> of organic <b>farming</b> than of North-eastern and Southern region. Organic <b>farming</b> and generally <b>alternative</b> <b>farming</b> systems could improve environmental and socio-economic conditions of the island. In order to maintain and expand organic farming that contributes in the sustainable management of rural landscape, policy decisions should be adjusted to faming particularities and activities that ensure satisfactory conditions to residents’ employment should be grown...|$|R
