6000|$|GILBEY. What was <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault?</b> I'm half distracted. I {{dont know}} what has {{happened}} to the boy: hes been lost these fourteen days-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> you beast! You started it. We've got {{two hundred}} lines apiece, and Heffy's lookin' for you. Just {{see what that}} swine Malpas did to my eye!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well; but what's {{to become}} of me?' urged the selfish man, who {{never thought of}} anybody else. 'It's <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault.</b> I'll tell you what--I'll sit by your fire till you come back again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Katharine," [...] said Lady Barbara, {{almost as}} sternly as ever; [...] "I {{had thought that}} with <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>faults</b> you were to be trusted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's <b>all</b> <b>your</b> own <b>fault,</b> archdeacon," [...] {{said the}} latter. [...] "I told {{you from the}} {{beginning}} how it would end, and papa has no one to thank but you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't that you're splendid or I," [...] said Capes. [...] "But we satisfy one another. Heaven alone knows why. So completely! The oddest fitness! What is it made of? Texture of {{skin and}} texture of mind? Complexion and voice. I don't think I've got illusions, nor you.... If I had never met {{anything}} of you at all but a scrap of your skin binding a book, Ann Veronica, I know I would have kept that somewhere near to me.... <b>All</b> <b>your</b> <b>faults</b> are just jolly modelling to make you real and solid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It? what?" [...] said Gerald. [...] "Come, don't be so like a girl! I {{have not}} been doing any thing wrong, I tell you, and it is <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> if I can't get clear." ...|$|E
60|$|BLAYNE. Consequently, we {{are sitting}} here till past one o'clock, talking scandal like a set of Station cats. Anthony, it's <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault.</b> We were {{perfectly}} respectable till you came in Go to bed. I'm off, Good-night all.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> sor!" [...] {{declared}} Major Doyle, {{selecting the}} little millionaire as the safest recipient of his displeasure. [...] "Your foolishness has involved {{us all in}} this dreadful complication. Why on earth couldn't you leave well-enough alone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed, I shall not. You must go and {{get along}} {{as well as you}} can. It is <b>all</b> <b>your</b> own <b>fault.</b> Now, go up stairs and hurry. We shall not find time for prayers this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I ’aven’t got it," [...] says Jimmy, {{stamping}} ’is foot, [...] "that’s why, and it’s <b>all</b> <b>your</b> silly <b>fault.</b> Arter {{you came}} pawing through my pockets {{when you thought}} I was asleep I got frightened and ’id it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Cervantes's own {{preface to}} Don Quixote {{is a perfect}} model of the gentle, every where intelligible, irony in the best essays of the Tatler and the Spectator. Equally natural and easy, Cervantes is more {{spirited}} than Addison; whilst he blends with the terseness of Swift, an exquisite flow and music of style, and above all, contrasts with the latter by the sweet temper of a superior mind, which saw the follies of mankind, and was even at the moment suffering severely under hard mistreatment;[1] and yet seems every where to have but one thought as the undersong-- [...] "Brethren! with <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>faults</b> I love you still!"--or as a mother that chides the child she loves, with one hand holds up the rod, {{and with the other}} wipes off each tear as it drops! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault.</b> Give me a push now, do, {{and send}} me over. I have been {{standing}} here waiting for help. You are the man--of all men. You helped at the beginning; {{you ought to}} have a hand in the end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> you drunken little blackguard!" [...] he said, turning savagely on the Tottie, who, {{now that}} his {{excitement}} had left him, was snivelling and drivelling in an intoxicated fashion, and calling him his preserver and his Baas in maudlin accents.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mrs. March, [...] "I wish I {{had never}} seen them; and it's <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> Basil. Of course, when you played upon my sympathies so about them, I couldn't help feeling {{interested}} in them. We {{are a couple of}} romantic old geese, my dear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was <b>all</b> my <b>fault,</b> <b>your</b> Majesty," [...] said Jack, looking rather foolish, [...] "I {{thought we}} must surely speak {{different}} languages, since {{we came from}} different countries." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty,' Alice {{went on as}} soon as {{they were}} comfortably settled again, 'when I saw all the {{mischief}} you had been doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into the snow! And you'd have deserved it, you little mischievous darling! What have you got to say for yourself? Now don't interrupt me!' she went on, holding up one finger. 'I'm going to tell you <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>faults.</b> Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this morning. Now you can't deny it, Kitty: I heard you! What's that you say?' (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) 'Her paw went into your eye? Well, that's <b>YOUR</b> <b>fault,</b> for keeping <b>your</b> eyes open--if you'd shut them tight up, it wouldn't have happened. Now don't make any more excuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her! What, you were thirsty, were you? How do you know she wasn't thirsty too? Now for number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasn't looking! ...|$|R
60|$|LORD WINDERMERE. [Standing C.] I {{sometimes}} {{wish you}} had. I {{should have been}} spared then the misery, the anxiety, the annoyance {{of the last six}} months. But rather than my wife should know--that the mother whom she was taught to consider as dead, the mother whom she has mourned as dead, is living--a divorced woman, going about under an assumed name, a bad woman preying upon life, as I know you now to be--rather than that, I was ready to supply you with money to pay bill after bill, extravagance after extravagance, to risk what occurred yesterday, the first quarrel I have ever had with my wife. You don't understand what that means to me. How could you? But I tell you that the only bitter words that ever came from those sweet lips of hers were on your account, and I hate to see you next her. You sully the innocence that is in her. [Moves L.C.] And then I used to think that with <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>faults</b> you were frank and honest. You are not.|$|R
6000|$|Gerald {{made a face}} {{of utter}} contempt. The steam whistle was heard; they were stopping. [...] "There is an end of it, then" [...] said he, angrily. [...] "I did not think you had been so ill-natured; it is <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> I tell you. I thought you cared for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> you cowardly dog," [...] said Seneky, almost fiercely, for shame {{had filled}} {{his face with}} blood. [...] "Had you kept on your feet, and not run me down, in your haste to get off, I might have retreated, and got clear {{with the rest of}} them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I well-nigh won to them. The grass {{house is}} my hearth, and the Martha my saddle, and--and {{look at all}} the trees I've planted, {{to say nothing of the}} sweet corn. And it's <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> anyway. I might never have loved you if you hadn't put the idea into my head." ...|$|E
6000|$|Old Granny Fox {{gave him}} a shove. [...] "You go along and do as I say!" [...] she snapped. [...] "If you had minded me, we wouldn't have to move. It's <b>all</b> <b>your</b> own <b>fault.</b> The wonder is that you weren't killed when you poked your head out {{right in front of}} Farmer Brown's boy. Now that he knows where we live, he will give us no peace. Move along lively now! This is the best home I have ever had, and now I've got to leave it. Oh dear! Oh dear!" ...|$|R
50|$|Sir, as I {{had not the}} {{pleasure}} of seeing you since you came to your government of Galway, I hope soon {{to see you in}} the Elysian fields, as I am just going off the stage. And I am sure, if you don't leave that town, you'll lose your life before the 10th of next month. 'Tis <b>all</b> <b>your</b> own <b>fault,</b> for you could not bear the employment which you got, not for your bravery, but for the slaughter you committed on poor people after Culloden fight. You'll be served as Lord Lovat's agent was. God be merciful to your soul.|$|R
5000|$|Examination of {{conscience}} was commanded by the Apostle St. Paul {{to be performed}} by the faithful each time they received Holy Communion: [...] "But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself.... For if we would judge ourselves, {{we should not be}} judged." [...] ( [...] , KJV). And, as the early Christians received Holy Communion very frequently, examination {{of conscience}} became a familiar exercise of their spiritual lives. In many cases, this became a daily practice of the lives of early members of the clergy and those living a monastic life, such as the hermit St. Anthony, who was said to have examined his conscience every night, while St. Basil of Caesarea, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Bernard of Clairvaux, and founders of religious orders generally made the examination of conscience a regular daily exercise of their followers. Lay members of congregations were encouraged to take up the practice as a salutary measure to advance in virtue. St. Bernard had taught: [...] "As a searching investigator of the integrity of your own conduct, submit your life to a daily examination. Consider carefully what progress you have made or what ground you have lost. Strive to know yourself. Place <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>faults</b> before <b>your</b> eyes. Come face to face with yourself, as though you were another person, and then weep for your faults." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{heard what}} she said,' cried Mrs Griffith. 'He's married!' ... She {{looked at her}} husband contemptuously. 'It's all very well for you to carry on like that now. It was you who did it; it was <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault.</b> If she'd been brought up as I wanted her to be, this wouldn't ever have happened.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{doubt she}} will opine {{that it is}} <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> dearest, and that I have behaved admirably. Between you I shall stand exonerated. And now, since it is too cold for walking, since it is late, since it is far to Lyvern and farther to London, I must improvise some {{accommodation}} for you here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{he was not}} a mere boy, I {{should say}} a lover's quarrel was at the bottom of it,' said Eveleen. 'Depend upon it, Laura, it is <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault.</b> You only danced once with him at our ball, and all this week you have played for us, as if it was on purpose to cut him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a word. You {{sometimes}} see it get home, or miss, as {{the case}} may be. Of course, it's never <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> if it misses. It's <b>all</b> <b>your</b> second-in-command." ...|$|R
6000|$|Frank, who {{had been}} looking on with a stupid air at the papers, as they flamed in the old brazier, took out his sword and broke it, holding his head down:--"I go with my cousin," [...] says he, giving Esmond a grasp of the hand. [...] "Marquis or not, by ---, I stand by him any day. I beg your Majesty's pardon for swearing; that is--that is--I'm for the Elector of Hanover. It's <b>all</b> <b>your</b> Majesty's own <b>fault.</b> The Queen's dead most likely by this time. And {{you might have been}} King if you hadn't come {{dangling}} after Trix." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Davidson {{would be}} sure to think she belonged to our family {{when she was in}} our pew," [...] she said bitterly. [...] "Oh, I feel as if I could never get over such a mortification! Peter, I do wish you wouldn't go telling people they ought to go to church. It's <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> that this happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and a fat {{lot of good}} it's done us," [...] said Naughten. [...] "They come in {{here and}} jaw our heads off when we ought to be jawin' them. Beetle talks to us as if we were a lot of blackguards and--and all that. And when they've hung us up to dry, they go out and slam the door like a house-master. <b>All</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> Tulke." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} a letter from Lufton," [...] Mr. Sowerby said to him the next morning. [...] "He {{declares}} that the delay was <b>all</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault.</b> You were to have told Lady Lufton before he did anything, and he was waiting {{to write about it}} till he heard from you. It seems that you never said a word to her ladyship on the subject." ...|$|E
60|$|Almah. It was <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> {{that fire}} seized <b>all</b> <b>your</b> breast; You should have blown up some {{to save the}} rest: But 'tis, at worst, but so {{consumed}} by fire, As cities are, that by their fall rise higher. Build love a nobler temple in my place; You'll find the fire has but enlarged your space.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see why. It's not <b>your</b> <b>fault.</b> Very {{sporting}} of <b>your</b> {{brother and}} <b>all</b> that, of course, though I'm blowed if I'd {{have done it}} myself; but why should you do anything? You're <b>all</b> right. <b>Your</b> brother stood out of the team to let you in it, and here you are, in it. What's he got to grumble about?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should say}} it was <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> Tom," [...] Mrs. Ellison said sharply--"very much <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> if you throw a great stone at a bird without taking care {{to see what it}} may hit. But that is nothing to <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> in letting another boy be punished for what you did. I shall report the matter to the squire, and he will speak to your father about it. You are a wicked, bad boy.|$|R
