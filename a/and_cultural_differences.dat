25|$|There {{are over}} 22 million Han Chinese in Taiwan; they began {{migrating}} from the southeastern coastal provinces of mainland China (especially from Fujian provience)to Taiwan during the 13th to 17th century. At first, these migrants chose {{to settle in}} locations that bore a resemblance to the areas they had left behind in mainland China, {{regardless of whether they}} arrived in the north or south of Taiwan. Hoklo immigrants from Quanzhou settled in coastal regions, and those from Zhangzhou tended to gather on inland plains, while the Hakka inhabited hilly areas. Clashes between these groups over land, water, <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> led to the relocation of some communities, and, as time passed, varying degrees of intermarriage and assimilation took place.|$|E
25|$|The depopulation, {{defended by}} Claudio Sanchez-Albornoz, is doubted today, at least {{concerning}} its magnitude. Two main arguments {{are used to}} refute it. First, the minor toponymy was preserved in multiple districts. Second, there are biological <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> between {{the inhabitants of the}} Cantabrian zone and those of the central Plateau. What is true is that {{in the first half of}} the eighth century there was a process of rural growth that led to the abandonment of urban life and the organization of the population in small communities of shepherds. Several causes explain this process: The definitive breakdown of the production system based on slavery in existence from the time of the late Roman Empire, the continuous propagation of epidemics in the area, and the abandonment of al-Andalus by the Berber regiments after the revolt of 740-741. All this made possible the emergence of a sparsely populated and ill-organized area that isolated the Asturian kingdom from the Moorish assaults and allowed its progressive strengthening.|$|E

25|$|The Baroque era in music, {{between the}} early {{music of the}} Medieval and Renaissance periods and the {{development}} of fully fledged and formalised orchestral classical music {{in the second half of}} the eighteenth century, was characterised by more elaborate musical ornamentation, changes in musical notation, new instrumental playing techniques and the rise of new genres such as opera. Although the term Baroque is conventionally used for European music from about 1600, its full effects were not felt in Britain until after 1660, delayed by native trends and developments in music, religious <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> from many European countries and the disruption to court music caused by the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and Interregnum. Under the restored Stuart monarchy the court became once again a centre of musical patronage, but royal interest in music tended to be less significant as the seventeenth century progressed, to be revived again under the House of Hanover.|$|E
25|$|Baroque {{music of}} the British Isles bridged {{the gap between the}} early {{music of the}} Medieval and Renaissance periods and the {{development}} of fully fledged and formalised orchestral classical music {{in the second half of}} the eighteenth century. It was characterised by more elaborate musical ornamentation, changes in musical notation, new instrumental playing techniques and the rise of new genres such as opera. Although the term Baroque is conventionally used for European music from about 1600, its full effects were not felt in Britain until after 1660, delayed by native trends and developments in music, religious <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> from many European countries and the disruption to court music caused by the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and Interregnum. Under the restored Stuart monarchy the court became once again a centre of musical patronage, but royal interest in music tended to be less significant as the seventeenth century progressed, to be revived again under the House of Hanover. The Baroque era in British music can be seen as one of an interaction of national and international trends, sometimes absorbing continental fashions and practices and sometimes attempting, as in the creation of ballad opera, to produce an indigenous tradition. However, arguably the most significant British composer of the era, George Frideric Handel, was a naturalised German, who helped integrate British and continental music and define the future of the classical music of the United Kingdom that would be officially formed in 1801.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a conceptualisation {{of the impact}} of culture <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>difference</b> on the mediation process. The argument is structured according to Jacob Bercovitch's (1984, 1992, 1996) 'Contingency Model' of mediation which views mediation outcomes as contingent on the interaction between the dispute context (nature of the parties, issues, and mediator) and the mediation process. The conception of culture presented here is sourced {{from a wide variety of}} disciplines with special emphasis placed on ideas put forth by Kevin Avruch (1998) and Raymond Cohen (1990, 1993, 1996). Building on these conceptions, this thesis {{presents a}} more sophisticated and nuanced conceptualisation of culture as a phenomenon. This conception is then applied to each of the variables in Bercovitch's 'Contingency Model' to create a thorough and systematic understanding of the impact culture <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>difference</b> has on the mediation process. This approach is then tested for validity by its application to a case study: the Iranian - United States hostage crisis, 1979 - 1981 arid the successful Algerian mediation that occurred from November 1980 until the eventual release of the hostages on January 20 th 1981. The conclusions drawn support the arguments advanced in the first part of the thesis, This thesis concludes by noting how it is a conceptualisation {{of the impact of}} culture <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>difference</b> on the mediation process, rather than a recipe for mediating between different cultures. Mediators are considered to require a comprehensive understanding of the actual cultures involved in the dispute; this thesis seeks to explain how those cultures may influence the context, process and outcome of mediation...|$|R

500|$|Finally, the German {{tradition}} {{of local and}} regional autonomy created structural <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> in the Holy Roman Empire, compared to the increasingly centralized authority of such other European states as France, England, and Spain. The unabashed intervention of Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, English and Scots mercenaries in the war, {{as well as the}} influence of papal gold, changed the dynamic of internal German confessional and dynastic disputes. The great [...] "players" [...] of the Early Modern European political stage realized that they could enhance their own positions vis-a-vis one another by assisting, promoting or undermining local and regional competition among the German princes, {{as they did in the}} feud between Gebhard and Ernst. Conversely, German princes, dukes, and counts realized that they could acquire an edge over their competitors by promoting the interests of powerful neighbors.|$|E

[...] In 1810, the country had gained independence from the Spanish Empire, but Sarmiento complains that Argentina had yet to cohere as a unified entity. [...] The country's chief political division saw the Unitarists (or Unitarians, with whom Sarmiento sided), who favored centralization, counterposed against the Federalists, who believed that the regions should maintain a good measure of autonomy. This division was in part a split between {{the city and the}} countryside. [...] Then as now, Buenos Aires was the country’s largest and wealthiest city {{as a result of its}} access to river trade routes and the South Atlantic. Buenos Aires was exposed not only to trade but to fresh ideas and European culture. These economic <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> caused tension between Buenos Aires and the land-locked regions of the country.
