25|$|With {{religious}} <b>approval</b> <b>granted,</b> Saudi forces launched frontal {{assaults on}} {{three of the}} main gates. Again the assaulting force was repulsed as {{they were unable to}} break through the insurgents' defenses. Snipers continued to pick off soldiers who revealed themselves. The insurgents aired their demands from the mosque's loudspeakers throughout the streets of Mecca, calling for the cut-off of oil exports to the United States and the expulsion of all foreign civilian and military experts from the Arabian Peninsula. In Beirut an opposition organization (the Arab Socialist Action Party – Arabian Peninsula) issued a statement on 25 November, alleging to clarify the demands of the insurgents. The party, however, denied any involvement in the seizure of the Grand Mosque.|$|E

25|$|Ondansetron (marketed {{under the}} brand name Zofran) was {{developed}} in the mid-1980s by GlaxoSmithKline in London. It was granted US patent protection in September 1987, received a use patent June 1988, and was approved by the US FDA in January 1991. It was granted another divisional patent in November 1996. Finally, owing to GlaxoSmithKline's research on pediatric use, ondansetron's patent protection was extended until December 2006. By this final year of its patent (2006), Zofran had become the 20th highest-selling brand-name drug in the United States, with sales of US$1.3 billion in the first 9 months of 2006 (80% from the US). The first generic versions were approved by the US FDA in December 2006, with marketing <b>approval</b> <b>granted</b> to Teva Pharmaceuticals USA and SICOR Pharmaceuticals.|$|E
25|$|Stories of heavenly ascents {{were fairly}} {{common in the}} time of Jesus, {{signifying}} the means whereby a prophet could attain access to divine secrets, or divine <b>approval</b> <b>granted</b> to an exceptionally righteous individual, or the deification of an exceptional man. Figures familiar to Jews would have included Enoch (from the Book of Genesis and a popular non-Biblical work called 1 Enoch); the 5th century sage Ezra; Baruch the companion of the prophet Jeremiah (from a work called 2 Baruch, in which Baruch is promised he will ascend to heaven after 40 days); Levi the ancestor of priests; the Teacher of Righteousness from the Qumran community; the prophet Elijah (from 2 Kings); Moses, who was deified on entering heaven; and the children of Job, who according to the Testament of Job ascended heaven following their resurrection from the dead. Non-Jewish readers would have been familiar with the case of the emperor Augustus, whose ascent was witnessed by Senators; Romulus the founder of Rome, who, like Jesus, was taken to heaven in a cloud; the Greek hero Heracles (Hercules); and others.|$|E
60|$|But we {{must stop}} short in these considerations, which would {{lead us to}} {{boundless}} lengths. We {{had something to say}} on the public moral character of Burns; but this also we must forbear. We are far from regarding him as guilty before the world, as guiltier than the average; nay, from doubting that he is less guilty than one of ten thousand. Tried at a tribunal far more rigid than that where the Plebiscita of common civic reputations are pronounced, he has seemed to us even there less worthy of blame than of pity and wonder. But the world is habitually unjust in its judgments of such men; unjust on many grounds, of which this one may be stated as the substance: it decides, like a court of law, by dead statutes; and not positively but negatively; less on what is done right, than on what is, or is not, done wrong. Not the few inches of reflection from the mathematical orbit, which are so easily measured, but the ratio of these to the whole diameter, constitutes the real aberration. This orbit may be a planet's, its diameter the breadth of the solar system; or it may be a city hippodrome; nay, the circle of a ginhorse, its diameter a score of feet or paces. But the inches of deflection only are measured; and it is assumed that the diameter of the ginhorse, and that of the planet, will yield the same ratio when compared with them. Here lies the root of many a blind, cruel condemnation of Burnses, Swifts, Rousseaus, which one never listens to with <b>approval.</b> <b>Granted,</b> the ship comes into harbor with shrouds and tackle damaged; and the pilot is therefore blameworthy; for he has not been all-wise and all-powerful; but to know how blameworthy, tell us first whether his voyage has been round the Globe, or only to Ramsgate and the Isle of Dogs.|$|E

40|$|To meet {{healthcare}} {{demands and}} costs, Tanzania {{depends largely on}} imports and financial aid from foreign countries. Current research analyses the impact of market competition on the cost and availability of medicine in Tanzania. Product <b>approvals</b> <b>granted</b> by Tanzanian drug regulatory authority were analyzed {{on the basis of}} exporting countries, molecules and therapeutic categories. The market competition among various countries was analyzed using UN trade statistics database ‘Comtrade’. Our analysis revealed that India offers large number of competing vendors per molecule and has the highest average share in the product <b>approvals</b> <b>granted</b> in all major therapeutic categories. The analysis also reveals that most of the currently used second line therapy molecules that are essential for Tanzania are protected by patents and the country needs to consider utilization of TRIPS flexibilities to improve accessibility and affordability of medicine.
