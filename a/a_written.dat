5|$|All {{of these}} {{decisions}} were ratified in the Accord of Winchester that year, witnessed by the King and the papal legate, or {{representative of the}} pope, {{as well as many}} bishops and abbots. Thomas then made <b>a</b> <b>written</b> profession of obedience, some time after late May. Lanfranc wrote to AlexanderII, attempting to get <b>a</b> <b>written</b> papal privilege of Canterbury's primacy, but Alexander replied that Lanfranc must personally resubmit the case to the papal court before a papal privilege could be issued. Alexander died in 1073. His successor, Pope GregoryVII, was opposed to the idea of primacies, and the matter of the papal privilege for Canterbury went nowhere. In 1073, with the help of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester and Peter, Bishop of Chester, Thomas consecrated Radulf as Bishop of Orkney in an attempt to increase York's authority in Scotland. Wulfstan often performed episcopal functions in parts of the diocese of York during the 1070s for Thomas, especially in areas that were still in turmoil after the conquest.|$|E

5|$|In Mississippi Republican Executive Opinion v. Brooks (1984), the Supreme Court summarily affirmed, without <b>a</b> <b>written</b> opinion, a lower court's {{decision}} that 1982 amendment to Section 2 is constitutional.

In later cases, the Supreme Court {{is more likely to}} disregard one of its previous judgments that lacks <b>a</b> <b>written</b> opinion, but lower courts must respect the Supreme Court's unwritten summary affirmances as being as equally binding on them as Supreme Court judgments with written opinions. Partially due to Brooks, the constitutionality of the Section 2 results test has since been unanimously upheld by lower courts.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} outline of the Modular Theory of Writing Systems by {{answering}} the question: {{what are the elements}} or modules that are necessary for <b>a</b> <b>writing</b> system to work? <b>A</b> <b>writing</b> system is <b>a</b> notational system for a natural language. Based on this characterization, it is obvious that a necessary component of <b>a</b> <b>writing</b> system is <b>a</b> specific language system. What eventually constitutes <b>a</b> <b>writing</b> system in addition to this language system is a device that, put simply, relates units of a language system to units of a script. This component is termed ‘graphematics’ in the present framework and is regarded as a necessary module of <b>a</b> <b>writing</b> system. Above that, another typical component of writing systems, namely ‘systematic orthography’, applies to the ‘graphematic solution space’ and restricts the spelling possibilities of specific words in accordance to their belonging to a specific level of the vocabulary of the language. Supplemented by reflections on the status of scripts as well as of IPA as <b>a</b> <b>writing</b> system, <b>an</b> answer is finally given to the pertinent question how spoken language and written language are related to each other. The answer is that this relation is of a considerably indirect nature...|$|R
