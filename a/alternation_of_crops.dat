60|$|Various {{ideas were}} entertained {{as to the}} {{magnitude}} of this blissful region. As Adam and all his progeny were to have lived there, had he not sinned, and as {{there would have been no}} such thing as death to thin the number of mankind, it was inferred that the terrestrial paradise must be of great extent to contain them. Some gave it a size equal to Europe or Africa; others gave it the whole southern hemisphere. St. Augustine supposed that as mankind multiplied, numbers would be translated without death to heaven; the parents, perhaps, when their children had arrived at mature age; or portions of the human race at the end of certain periods, and when the population of the terrestrial paradise had attained a certain amount. [398] Others supposed that mankind, remaining in a state of primitive innocence, would not have required so much space as at present. Having no need of rearing animals for subsistence, no land would have been required for pasturage; and the earth not being cursed with sterility, there would have been no need of extensive tracts of country to permit of fallow land and the <b>alternation</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> required in husbandry. The spontaneous and never-failing fruits of the garden would have been abundant for the simple wants of man. Still, that the human race might not be crowded, but might have ample space for recreation and enjoyment, and the charms of variety and change, some allowed at least a hundred leagues of circumference to the garden.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Ethnoecological {{knowledge}} may {{be understood}} as spontaneous knowledge, culturally referenced of any society's members, learned and transmitted through social interactions and that are targeted at resolution of daily routine situations. The traditional knowledge in small scale economy societies {{as well as the}} non-academic knowledge in urban-industrial societies might be included in this concept. An ethnoecological approach study was performed here on people living at the communities of Alvinho, Almeida, Chã do Marinho, Floriano, and Chã de Oiti, all located in the municipality of Lagoa Seca, Paraíba state, Northeast Brazil. The general objective pursued here was to study the knowledge that peasant farmers have on management of plant species utilized for pest control. For this, the methodological instruments employed here to investigate the ethnoecological knowledge were: direct observation, structured and semi-structured interviews, and tours conducted by local peasant farmers. We analyzed the data obtained under an emic/etic view and also by comparing the local knowledge with those obtained from the literature. The results showed that people in those communities utilize management alternatives for controlling pests, which are mainly: (i) fallowing; (ii) crop rotation; (iii) destruction <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> remains and fruits attacked by pests; (iv) <b>alternations</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> with repellent plants; and/or (v) mixed cropping; (vi) insect's larvae covered with soil; (vii) crops irrigated abundantly; and (viii) soil preparation. The recovery and comprehension we get about this knowledge as well as the farmers' savoir faire, are extremely important to the revival of ancient agricultural practices, which have been forgotten due to advances in modern agriculture. The data obtained here showed that a huge body of knowledge the farmers have on many forms or strategies of management are generally compatible with scientific knowledge. </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{intervene}} {{on urban}} development, {{with the aim}} of finding an alternative model that has emerged in the last century, a sustainable approach is necessary so as to establish the territory as a pattern in which {{it is not possible to}} detect the boundaries between the natural and artificial environments and in which each process is controlled so that its impact and, consequently, the irreversible degradation induced is the minimum possible in relation to the constraints of the process itself. The urban context should be seen as an organism with a dynamic balance achieved through the technological control of complex functions. With the aim of achieving these objectives, the role of open urban spaces is particularly important, since they constitute nodal elements capable of performing the delicate function of linking the urban systems with the surrounding natural ones, while assuming a strategic role in the transformation of anthropized areas. In this context urban farming can make a valuable contribution as an effective instrument for the renewal of urban open space because offers significant possibilities from an environmental, economic and social perspective (Franchino, 2015). The drawing of a territory offers a contribution into the phases of a local context analysis and architectural design communication. In the specific field of urban farming and about the project introduced in this abstract,the study of the area has been the preparatory analysis phase for the knowledge of the local resources,founding premise of a proper planning process. The analysis of the agricultural vocation of the area emerged also through the map comparative study, both diachronic and synchronic. This study, simultaneous to the study of urban farming models, has allowed the development of the project idea. The representation and communication of the project took place through different methods and tools. The articulation of the interior and open spaces occurred through plan and front views, the communication of the project is rather occurred through render views that illustrated both changes through day and night views, but also the landscape modifies through the evolution and the <b>alternations</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> over the seasons. In order to obtain an applicative definition of these concepts, is presented a structured case study related to the requalification of a degraded urban area in the South of Italy...|$|R
40|$|Shifting cultivation" - the <b>alternation</b> <b>of</b> periods <b>of</b> <b>cropping</b> with {{relatively}} {{long periods of}} fallow-encompasses many indigenous agricultural systems, developed in a remarkable diversity of environments throughout the tropics. When the fallow includes woody perennials, shifting cultivation is an agroforestry practice with temporal sequencing <b>of</b> agricultural <b>crops</b> and trees. The cultural, edaphic, ecological, and agronomic features of shifting cultivation systems have been studied in great detail (Conklin 1957, 1963; Nye and Greenland, Unesco, de Schlippe, Allan, Fresco). It has been established that in any agroecosystem the length <b>of</b> the <b>cropping</b> period and length of fallow period are key components of long-run stability. Although the pivotal role of labor for clearing and weeding in regulating the cycles of shifting cultivation has been repeatedly remarked (Conklin 1957, de Schlippe, Nye and Greenland, Jurion and Henry, Dabasi-Schweng), {{the relationship between the}} labor economy of shifting cultivation and the cropping and fallow cycles has been neglected. Labor is the primary input {{in the vast majority of}} west African farming systems, and clearing and weeding operations account for most agricultural labor in almost all cases (Baldwin; Fresco; Guyer 1972, 1984). Clearing and weeding operations are central to the decision to mechanize (Pingali, Bigot, and Binswanger). Nevertheless, economists have looked elsewhere for explanations of land-use intensity in fallow-based systems (Stryker). In the present paper, a model of shifting cultivation is proposed based on the hypothesis that labor required for clearing and weeding are major determinants of the age of fallow to clear and length <b>of</b> time to <b>crop.</b> The model provides the economic complement to the cultural and biophysical mechanisms regulating allocation of human and natural resources in shifting and bushfallow agriculture. Most of the examples in this paper will be drawn from fallows with predominantly woody climax vegetation in humid and subhumid, lowland, tropical areas, mainly in west and central Africa...|$|R
