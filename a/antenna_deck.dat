50|$|H端nenburg Telecommunication Tower has 40 metres {{above ground}} an {{equipment}} {{room with a}} volume of 2500 cubic metres. On it, there is in a height of 49.6 metres a deck with directional antennas. A second smaller <b>antenna</b> <b>deck</b> is situated 55 metres above ground. Further smaller decks for antennas with directional antennas are situated 89 and 123.5 metres above ground. Between a height of 123.5 and 146.25 metres there are on the red-white painted antenna mast the FM-broadcasting antennas fixed. The pinnacle above 146.5 metres carries a glass fibre cylinder with the UHF-TV-broadcasting antennas.|$|E
5000|$|The Avco AN/FPS-26 Radar was an Air Defense Command {{height finder radar}} {{developed}} in the Frequency Diversity Program with a tunable 3-cavity power klystron for electronic counter-countermeasures (e.g. to counter jamming). Accepted by the Rome Air Development Center on 20 January 1960 for use at SAGE radar stations, the AN/FPS-26 processed height-finder requests (e.g., from Air Defense Direction Centers) by positioning to the azimuth of a target aircraft using a high-pressure hydraulic drive, then [...] "nodding" [...] in either a default automatic mode or by operator command. The inflatable radome required a minimum pressure to prevent contact with the antenna which would result in damage to both (technicians accessed the <b>antenna</b> <b>deck</b> via an air lock.) To maintain high dielectric strength, the waveguide was pressurized with sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), which technicians were warned would produce deadly fluorine if the waveguide arcing occurred.|$|E
50|$|It {{was built}} in 1972 as {{replacement}} for a smaller telecommunication tower, built in 1952. After {{the construction of the}} H端nenburg Telecommunication Tower, the old telecommunication tower was rebuilt into an observation tower, whereby the <b>antenna</b> <b>decks</b> were removed and some intermediate ceilings were installed. Today, it is called the H端nenburg Observation Tower and houses a museum with its history and the history of H端nenburg Telecommunication Tower and a restaurant.|$|R

50|$|With {{regard to}} the {{transmitting}} <b>antenna</b> above <b>decks,</b> {{it is essential that}} all aboard are aware when the transceiver is in use and transmissions are likely to be made. Anybody holding on to the relevant stay or touching the antenna feed wire could suffer severe HF burns if the transmitter is keyed.|$|R
25|$|On {{the centre}} of the mound where Fort de Kock used to be is a 20-metre height, white-green painted {{maintenance}} building of a radio <b>antenna.</b> A <b>deck</b> on top of the building provide vantage point of the city of Bukittinggi. There is little remaining of the original building on the fort but parts of the moats and 19th-century cannons which are now installed on top of the building.|$|R
50|$|Tests {{aboard a}} ship showed {{aircraft}} detection at 60 km and reliable measurement starting at 40 km. The mean errors {{were no more}} than 120-m in range and 0.8-degrees in azimuth and elevation angles. The time for determining the angular coordinates never exceeded 7 seconds, and the dead zone was down to 500 m. Similar accuracies were found for detecting all types of surface vessels, but with the Rubin <b>antenna</b> at <b>deck</b> level, the detection range was understandably much less than that for aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|As of 2013, One World Trade Center in New York City was {{considered}} to be the tallest skyscraper in the United States. Its spire brings the structure to a symbolic height of , connoting the year The Declaration of Independence was signed, though the tip of the structure actually is measured at [...] However, using the more common criterion for the height of a building (the [...] roof, not <b>antenna)</b> the observation <b>deck</b> elevation and highest occupied floor of the One World Trade Center are surpassed by Chicago's Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) and 432 Park Ave.|$|R
