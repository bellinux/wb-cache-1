5|$|During the Second World War, gun {{batteries}} {{were built}} on the island.

5|$|In the event, Titanics heading changed {{just in time}} {{to avoid}} a head-on collision, but the change in {{direction}} caused the ship to strike the iceberg with a glancing blow. <b>An</b> <b>underwater</b> spur of ice scraped along the starboard side of the ship for about seven seconds; chunks of ice dislodged from upper parts of the berg fell onto her forward decks. A few minutes later, all of Titanics engines were stopped, leaving the ship facing north and drifting in the Labrador Current.|$|E

5|$|After the six 735kV wires {{split up}} {{into two groups}} of three power lines each, the HVDC line follows the eastern group, and the western set diverges away. The line remains {{overhead}} until it reaches {{the north shore of}} the Saint Lawrence River near Grondines, where the 450kV HVDC line descends into <b>an</b> <b>underwater</b> tunnel traversing the river. The power line surfaces on the south shore near Lotbinière substation. After the river crossing, the line enters into the Nicolet terminal near Sainte-Eulalie, northeast of Drummondville. South of the terminal, the line heads south and after a relatively short distance, it enters the Des Cantons close to Sherbrooke.|$|E
5|$|An {{accident}} occurred aboard K-152 Nerpa at 8:30 PM {{local time}} on 8 November 2008, during <b>an</b> <b>underwater</b> test {{run in the}} Pacific Ocean. A total of 208 people – 81 military personnel and 127 civilians – were on board {{at the time of}} the accident. At least 20 people were killed by asphyxiation and at least 21 more were injured, making it the worst Russian submarine disaster since Kursk sank in 2000. Three of the dead were military personnel and the rest were civilians from the Vostok, Zvezda, Era and Amur shipbuilding yards who were members of the acceptance team.|$|E

5|$|Bond and Leiter {{alert the}} Thunderball war room of their suspicions of Largo {{and join the}} crew of the American nuclear {{submarine}} Manta as the ransom deadline nears. The Manta chases the Disco Volante to capture it and recover the bombs en route to the first target. An undersea battle ensues between the crews, while Bond fights Largo. Bond, now very weak from his efforts to disable the bombs, tries to get away, but Largo corners him in <b>an</b> <b>underwater</b> cave and easily overpowers him. Before Largo can finish Bond off Domino shoots him with a spear gun. The bombs are recovered and Bond is sent to hospital with Domino.|$|E

As the song wraps, the fairy taps on the girl and causes her to yawn. She falls asleep again and her toys go back to being as they were.

5|$|During {{her career}} Danton {{was sent to}} Great Britain to honor the {{coronation}} of George V, and later served in World War I as an escort for supply ships and troop transports, guarding them from elements of the German Navy. While en route to aid a blockade, she was torpedoed and sunk on 19 March 1917 by a German U-boat, leaving 296 men dead. The location of the wreck remained a mystery until <b>an</b> <b>underwater</b> survey team inadvertently discovered the battleship in December 2007. In February 2009, the wreck was confirmed to be Danton. The ship is in remarkably good shape for her age. Danton rests upright on the ocean floor, {{and most of the}} original equipment is reported to be intact.|$|E

5|$|Germany's {{refusal to}} give the Dutch access to plans {{detailing}} {{the design of the}} Scharnhorsts below the waterline was a major problem. Inexperienced in designing <b>an</b> <b>underwater</b> protection scheme for a ship of this size, the Dutch were forced to turn to Italy for assistance, which allowed a delegation of engineers and naval officers to enter the country in February 1940. Although the Dutch delegation was barred from viewing technical drawings or the battleship , then under construction, possibly to ensure that the details of their Pugliese system remained a secret, they were allowed to visit , toured several shipyards, interviewed the Chief Constructor of the Italian Navy, and received additional information on the Scharnhorsts, the ItaliansGermany's allyknowing some details of the ships.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with their expected mission, the boats could transport up to six naval commandos armed with 612 M-66 or M-71 limpet mines. Also at their disposal were four large AIM-70/71 bottom mines mounted {{on the outside of}} the submarines. Four R-1 swimmer delivery vehicles could be carried in place of the AIM-70/71 mines. With a full crew of six members the boats had <b>an</b> <b>underwater</b> endurance of 160 hours which was reduced to 96 hours if the complement numbered ten personnel (four crew members and six naval commandos).|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{underwater}} scenes, especially involving close-ups of Bond and Melina, were actually faked on a dry soundstage. A combination of lighting effects, slow-motion photography, wind, and bubbles added in post-production, gave {{the illusion of}} the actors being underwater. Actress Carole Bouquet reportedly had a pre-existing health condition that prevented her from performing actual underwater stunt work. Actual aquatic scenes were done by {{a team led by}} Al Giddings, who had previously worked on The Deep, and filmed in either Pinewood's tank on the 007 Stage or <b>an</b> <b>underwater</b> set built in the Bahamas. Production designer Peter Lamont and his team developed two working props for the submarine Neptune, as well as a mock-up with a fake bottom.|$|E
