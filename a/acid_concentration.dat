5|$|Because the {{reactions}} involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of {{moisture in the}} air {{in order for them to}} take place, keeping the air somewhat dry, i.e. keeping the environmental relative humidity under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring of the relative humidity (using instruments such as a hygrometer), and applying dehumidifiers when necessary; sometimes, simple air conditioning systems may suffice. Extremely low humidity can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a relative humidity maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate. Applying sorbents containing a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide, inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. Copy paper or KOH-impregnated filter paper are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These strong bases have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall <b>acid</b> <b>concentration</b> inside the enclosed space.|$|E

40|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of pre-eclampsia is contested, but one hypothesis {{indicates that}} it is a heterogeneous condition in which only a subset of affected women bear small-for-gestational age (SGA) babies. In intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) infants, placental transport of amino acids is diminished and the resulting decrease in cord-blood amino <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations</b> is thought to contribute to their stunted growth. In contrast, the metabolic syn-drome (dyslipidaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia, hypertension and obesity) which is associated with high amino <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations</b> is more prevalent in women with pre-eclampsia. The focus {{of this study was to}} compare maternal and fetal serum amino <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations</b> during normal pregnancy and pre-eclampsia and to evaluate the associations between the amino <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations</b> and fetal growth. The results indicate that maternal and cord-blood amino <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations</b> were significantly higher in women with pre-eclampsia compared with normal pregnant women and the concentrations were inversely associated with measures of infant growth. Maternal and cord-blood amino <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations</b> were also significantly higher in pre-eclamptic mothers with SGA infants compared with pre-eclamptic mothers whose babies were not SGA. These data indicate that, in contrast to IUGR, pre-eclampsia is associated with enhanced placental amino acid transport or reduced fetal amino acid utilization. Furthermore, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that pre-eclampsia is a heterogeneous disease associated with the metabolic syndrome...|$|R

25|$|Boric acid {{is used in}} some {{nuclear power}} plants as a neutron poison. The boron in boric acid reduces the {{probability}} of thermal fission by absorbing some thermal neutrons. Fission chain reactions are generally driven by the probability that free neutrons will result in fission and {{is determined by the}} material and geometric properties of the reactor. Natural boron consists of approximately 20% boron-10 and 80% boron-11 isotopes. Boron-10 has a high cross-section for absorption of low energy (thermal) neutrons. By increasing boric <b>acid</b> <b>concentration</b> in the reactor coolant, the probability that a neutron will cause fission is reduced. Changes in boric <b>acid</b> <b>concentration</b> can effectively regulate the rate of fission taking place in the reactor. Boric acid is used only in pressurized water reactors (PWRs) whereas boiling water reactors (BWRs) employ control rod pattern and coolant flow for power control. BWRs use an aqueous solution of boric acid and borax or Sodium Pentaborate for an emergency shut down system. Boric acid may be dissolved in spent fuel pools used to store spent fuel elements. The concentration is high enough to keep neutron multiplication at a minimum. Boric acid was dumped over Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant after its meltdown to prevent another reaction from occurring.|$|E
25|$|While Ka {{measures}} {{the strength of}} an acidic molecule, the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by pH, which {{is a function of}} the concentration of hydronium ions in solution. The pH of a simple solution of an acid in water is determined by both Ka and the <b>acid</b> <b>concentration.</b> For weak acid solutions, it depends on the degree of dissociation, which may be determined by an equilibrium calculation. For concentrated solutions of strong acids with a pH less than about zero, the Hammett acidity function is a better measure of acidity than the pH.|$|E

This study was carried out to investigate the effect of whey protein supplementation on plasma essential amino <b>acids</b> <b>concentrations,</b> after resistance exercise in healthy athletes. In this clinical trial, changes of plasma essential amino <b>acids</b> <b>concentrations</b> were studied after 1 h exercise training and whey protein supplementation in 32 healthy volunteers (16 in each of supplement and placebo groups). Each day, whey protein supplement (20 g) and placebo (the same amount of starch) were consumed after training. Participants exercised with 80 % 1 RM, basically on stationary circuit principal, for 1 h. Blood specimens were taken in fasting state, immediately after exercise and 1 h after supplement consumption. Essential amino <b>acids</b> <b>concentrations</b> were analyzed by HPLC. Statistical analysis were carried out using Student t-test and paired t-test. Treonine concentration increased significantly after exercise (p< 0. 05), but {{there was no difference between}} the two study groups.

Treonine, arginine, methionine, valine, isoleucine and leucine concentrations increased significantly and phenylalanine concentration increased nonsignificantly in the supplement group. Treonine, methionine, valine, phenylalanine, isoleucine and leucine concentrations decreased significantly, but downward trend of arginine was not significant. Differences between the two groups were significant.

Formic and acetic <b>acids</b> <b>concentrations</b> measured in marine air upwind of the Los Angeles area over an 8 -month period average 1. 4 and 0. 6 ppb, respectively, while concentrations within the Los Angeles urban area average 2. 7 − 5. 8 ppb formic acid and 2. 9 − 4. 2 ppb acetic acid. Average formic and acetic <b>acids</b> <b>concentrations</b> exceed average HNO_ 3 and HCl concentra tions, making them the most abundant gas phase acids in the southern California atmosphere throughout the year.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, {{play a role}} in {{scavenging}} {{free radicals}} to protect against oxidative endothelial damage. Excess fat may promote fatty acid oxidation and increase free radical concentrations, which could result in increased antioxidant use. Whether plasma ascorbic <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations</b> are associated with fat distribution remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine the association between abdominal obesity, as measured by the waist-to-hip ratio, and plasma ascorbic <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the general population. DESIGN: We examined the cross-sectional relation between anthropometric measurements of fat distribution and plasma ascorbic <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations</b> in 19 068 men and women aged 45 - 79 y without known chronic illness. Dietary ascorbic acid intake was estimated for a subgroup of 8178 men and women who kept 7 -d food diaries coded for nutrient intake. RESULTS: The waist-to-hip ratio was inversely related to plasma ascorbic <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations</b> in both men and women. This association was independent of body mass index, age, vitamin supplement use, cigarette smoking, and socioeconomic group. Waist and hip circumferences showed separate and opposite associations with plasma ascorbic <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations,</b> independent of body mass index and other covariates. Dietary ascorbic acid intake only partly explained the observed associations. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma ascorbic acid was associated with fat distribution independent of body mass index. Differences in dietary intake and lifestyle habits, underlying systemic oxidative stress, or both may explain the inverse relation between fat distribution and plasma ascorbic <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Additional studies are needed to determine the underlying explanation of these observations...|$|R
25|$|The high {{temperature}} water coolant with boric acid dissolved in it is corrosive to carbon steel (but not stainless steel); this can cause radioactive corrosion products to circulate in the primary coolant loop.

METHODS: We investigated associations between serum polyunsaturated fatty <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations</b> and p 53 expression in normal skin, as a biomarker of early UV-induced carcinogenesis, in an unselected sample of Australian adults. Participants in the Nambour Skin Cancer Prevention Trial provided a dorsal hand punch biopsy which was used for immunohistochemical assessment of p 53 immunoreactivity. Cross-sectional associations with serum fatty <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations</b> were analyzed in 139 participants, adjusting for confounding variables including skin phenotype, past sun exposure, and smoking status. RESULTS: There was an inverse association, showing a dose-response relationship, between total n- 3 fatty <b>acid</b> serum <b>concentrations</b> and p 53 immunoreactivity in the whole epidermis and the basal layer. This was particularly due to eicosapentanoic acid and docosahexanoic <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations.</b> There was no evidence for increased p 53 immunoreactivity in participants with relatively high serum n- 6 fatty <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The ratio of n- 3 to n- 6 fatty <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations</b> was not associated with p 53 immunoreactivity.

Gastric juice ascorbic <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations</b> in 19 H pylori positive patients were significantly lower (median 2. 8, range 0 - 28. 8 micrograms/ml) than those in 10 H pylori negative controls (median 17. 8, range 5. 6 - 155. 4 micrograms/ml) (p < 0. 0005) despite similar plasma ascorbic <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations</b> in both groups. The median gastric juice:plasma ascorbic acid ratio in the H pylori positive patients was only 1. 16 (range 0. 02 - 6. 67), compared with a median ratio of 4. 87 (range 0. 76 - 21. 33) in H pylori negative controls (p < 0. 01). In the patients with H pylori infection {{there was a significant}} negative correlation between the severity of the antral polymorphonuclear infiltrate and gastric juice ascorbic <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations</b> (correlation coefficient - 0. 52, p = 0. 02). After eradication of H pylori in 11 patients, gastric juice ascorbic <b>acid</b> <b>concentrations</b> rose from 2. 4 (0 - 12. 8 micrograms/ml) to 11. 2 (0 - 50 micrograms/ml) (p = 0. 01).
