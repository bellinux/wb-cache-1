40|$|The {{globalization}} hazard hypothesis {{maintains that}} the current account reversals and asset price collapses observed during 'Sudden Stops' are caused by global capital market frictions. A policy implication of this view is that Sudden Stops can be prevented by offering global investors price guarantees on emerging markets <b>assets.</b> These <b>guarantees,</b> however, introduce a moral hazard incentive for global investors, thus creating a tradeoff by which price guarantees weaken globalization hazard but strengthen international moral hazard. This paper studies the quantitative implications of this tradeoff using a dynamic stochastic equilibrium asset-pricing model. Without guarantees, distortions induced by margin calls and trading costs cause Sudden Stops driven by Fisher's debt-deflation mechanism. Price guarantees prevent this deflation by introducing a distortion that props up foreign demand for <b>assets.</b> Non-state-contingent <b>guarantees</b> contain Sudden Stops but they are executed often and induce persistent <b>asset</b> overvaluation. <b>Guarantees</b> offered only in high-debt states are executed rarely and prevent Sudden Stops without persistent asset overvaluation. If the elasticity of foreign asset demand is low, price guarantees can still contain Sudden Stops but domestic agents obtain smaller welfare gains at Sudden Stop states and suffer welfare losses on average in the stochastic steady state. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{differences}} between traditional financial intermediaries (commercial banks, saving banks and credit cooperatives) and ethical banks that focus on positive social and ethical values. The credit crisis {{calls into question the}} functionality and good performance of traditional banks. The full incorporation of ethical values and principles by traditional financial intermediaries might be a form to solve their misleading financial situation. We have analyzed four factors that theoretically mean ethical differences: information transparency, placement of <b>assets,</b> <b>guarantees</b> and participation. These four factors are grouped in an index called Radical Affinity Index (RAI). The paper is focused on the study of RAI using a sample of 119 European banks. The evidence shows, that transparency of information and placement of assets are factors that differentiate ethical banks and the rest of financial intermediaries. The guarantees and participation, which seemed to be useful factors to differentiate ethical aspects of banks, do not support clear evidence to the analysis. In sum, RAI is a functional and useful index to show the ethical policy of financial intermediaries...|$|R
40|$|We formalize the {{taxpayer}} burden implied by various bank restructuring plans. Even assuming minimal frictions, in spirit of Modigliani and Miller (1958), when debt contracts cannot be changed, transfers from {{the taxpayer}} (in a Net Present Value sense) are necessary. Debt holders {{benefit from a}} lower default probability and a higher recovery given default. Absent government transfers, their gains imply a decrease in equity value. Shareholders will therefore oppose the restructuring unless they receive transfers from taxpayers. The taxpayer burden consists of the NPV of inflows and outflows of cash needed to persuade shareholders (or bank managers) to accept a change in capital structure. The government’s intervention aims at preventing systemic effects from a default of an important bank, and thus targets a default rate. Due to different implied recovery rates given default, the required transfer amounts vary across restructuring plans that achieve the same target default rate. In this regard, asset sales require more transfers than recapitalization or <b>asset</b> <b>guarantees,</b> because <b>asset</b> sales support a higher recovery rate.

40|$|When {{financial}} investors’ portfolio holdings are unconstrained, financial {{economies are}} assumed, w. l. o. g., {{to have no}} redundant assets. Indeed, eliminating redundant assets allows to replace the initial financial structure by an equivalent one, i. e., one that has the same consumption equilibria. Moreover, {{at the end of}} the process, absence of redundant <b>assets</b> <b>guarantees</b> that the set of admissible portfolio allocations is bounded, a fundamental property for the existence of equilibria. In the presence of institutional (exogenous) portfolio constraints, eliminating redundant assets is not innocuous anymore since bounded arbitrage may persist at equilibrium, the law of one price does not hold, and some zero-income portfolios may not be free. The goal of the paper is to replace the elimination of redundant assets by the elimination of useless portfolios, a process that eliminates in particular Werner useless portfolios, but needs to go beyond to obtain the boundedness of the set of admissible portfolio allocations {{at the end of the}} purification process. Moreover, the elimination process is carried out without affecting the set of consumption equilibria, hence replacing at each step the financial structure by an equivalent one...|$|R

To resist {{in a world in}} recession, the bank business requires a mix of new technical, financial and managerial skills and many sacrifices, costs and profits reductions, unheard a decade ago.
