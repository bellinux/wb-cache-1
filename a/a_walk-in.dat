5|$|Hersh's U.S. and Pakistani {{intelligence}} sources {{stated that the}} U.S. had learned of bin Laden's location through a Pakistani walk-in seeking the $25 million reward, and not through tracking a courier. NBC News and Agence France-Presse subsequently reported that their sources indicated <b>a</b> <b>walk-in</b> was an extremely valuable asset, though the sources disputed that the walk-in knew the location of bin Laden. Pakistan-based journalist Amir Mir in the News International reported the walk-in's identity to be Usman Khalid, though that allegation was denied by Khalid's family. The White House denied Hersh's report.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mulder's mother Teena {{is found}} dead in her home. It is found she overdosed on {{sleeping}} pills after she burned all her pictures of Samantha and placed tape around her baseboards and turned the gas in the oven on. Mulder believes she was murdered and has Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) do an autopsy. Later, Mulder visits the mother who was convicted twelve years prior. She tells him that Samantha is <b>a</b> <b>walk-in,</b> a kind spirit who takes children {{so that they may}} be shielded from potential harm in their life. The mother tells Mulder that the children are safe, but she has no idea where they are. After hearing this, Mulder believes his mother probably also wrote a note after his sister's disappearance. He begins to think that the alien abduction never happened, and that his mother figured this out, which is why she was murdered. However, after performing the autopsy, Scully tells Mulder that it was definitely suicide, because she was ill with Paget's carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Tawau has one public hospital, four {{public health}} clinics, three {{maternal}} {{and child health}} clinics, seven village clinics, one mobile clinic and two 1Malaysia clinics. Tawau Hospital, on Tanjung Batu Street, is the town's main hospital and an important healthcare facility for patients from Semporna, Lahad Datu, Kunak, and Sandakan. Indonesian patients near the border area also frequently visit the hospital. Tawau Specialist Polyclinics (TSPC) is <b>a</b> <b>walk-in</b> healthcare clinic that sees patients from Tawau and surrounding areas as well as patients from neighbouring Philippines and Indonesia. TSPC has a range of medical specialists, a medical laboratory and radiology services. The hospital has undergone a series of modernisations since 1990 with the construction of specialist clinics, Central Sterile Services Department (CSSD), new wards and operation theatres. Tawau Specialist Hospital is the only private hospital in the town. The Tawau Regional Library is one of three regional libraries in Sabah, the others are at Keningau and Sandakan. These libraries are operated by the Sabah State Library department. Some schools, colleges, or universities have private libraries.|$|E

5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, <b>a</b> <b>walk-in</b> larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E

40|$|Enabling {{patients}} {{to walk in}} for their diagnostic examination without an appointment has considerable potential in terms of quality of care, patient service, and system efficiency. We present a model to evaluate the effect of implementing <b>a</b> combined <b>walk-in</b> and appointment system, offering appointments to all patients preferring or strictly requiring these, while enabling all other {{patients to}} walk in. In a combined system, appointments can be scheduled in periods with low walk-in demand to counterbalance the possible high variability in walk-in arrival rates. We develop a discrete event simulation model, combined with an intelligent algorithmic methodology for appointment schedule optimization, for evaluating the implementation of <b>a</b> combined <b>walk-in</b> and appointment system for diagnostic examinations. Our simulation model is reusable: its component-based structure and generic underlying logic enable it to automatically represent any type of diagnostic facility, for which it can then evaluate the effect of implementing <b>a</b> combined <b>walk-in</b> and appointment system. Applying this approach, we quantitatively investigate the impact of implementing <b>a</b> combined <b>walk-in</b> and appointment system for CT-scans, performing a case study at the Academic Medical Center (AMC) Amsterdam. Inspired by the results, the AMC CT-facility has implemented <b>a</b> combined <b>walk-in</b> and appointment system, thereby shortening patients' diagnostic trajectories, and decreasing the number of required hospital visits for many patients.

25|$|Costco has a {{wide variety}} of {{changing}} inventory and is known for carrying products for a time, then discontinuing them or using them as seasonal products. Over the years, Costco has gradually expanded its range of products and services.

It now sells many other products that are more difficult to handle, such as art, books, caskets, clothing, computer software, fine wine, furniture home appliances, home electronics, hot tubs, jewelry, perishable items (such as dairy, fresh baked goods, flowers, fresh produce, meat, seafood), solar panels, tires, and vacuums.
