25|$|Between 17 and 18 April, Pope Benedict made an Apostolic Journey to the Republic of Malta. Following {{meetings}} with various dignitaries {{on his first}} day on the island, 50,000 people gathered in <b>a</b> <b>drizzle</b> for Papal Mass on the granaries in Floriana. The Pope also met with the Maltese youth at the Valletta Waterfront, where an estimated 10,000 young people turned up to greet him. During his visit the Pope was moved to tears while expressing his shame at cases of abuse on the island during a 20-minute meeting with victims.|$|E
25|$|Duchamp {{participated in}} the design of the 1938 International Surrealist Exhibition, which was held at the Galerie des Beaux-arts, Paris. The show {{featured}} more than 60 artists from different countries, including approximately 300 paintings, objects, collages, photographs, and installations. The surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act, and André Breton named Duchamp, Wolfgang Paalen, Man Ray, Salvador Dali, and Max Ernst to help him. At the exhibition's entrance he placed Salvador Dalí's Rainy Taxi, a work consisting of a taxicab rigged to produce <b>a</b> <b>drizzle</b> of water down the inside of its windows, with a shark-headed creature in the driver's seat, and a blond mannequin covered with live snails in the back. In this way Duchamp confronted guests entering the exhibition, who were in full evening dress.|$|E
500|$|... "The plane {{broke in}} two" [...] said one {{survivor}} [...] "and a dense black smoke invaded the cabin. I jumped out through {{an opening in}} the window. Six other passengers followed me. We fled, {{with the help of the}} inhabitants of the nearby village". Television footage from shortly after the crash showed the remains of the aircraft on fire and lying on its belly with smoke rising from the wreckage. The minister also stated that weather conditions were normal with a visibility of , and said wind conditions were calm and there was no rain at the time of the crash. <b>A</b> <b>drizzle</b> started only after the accident.|$|E

500|$|Gonzalo {{generated}} hurricane-force winds across Bermuda over {{a period}} of about six hours, at their strongest from the northwest on the backside of the storm. Tropical storm conditions persisted for up to 24hours. Elevated weather stations observed the highest winds; Commissioner's Point recorded 10-minute sustained winds of , and St. David's measured gusts as high as [...] Gusts reached [...] at the Causeway, closer to sea level. The airport recorded [...] of rain, but due to the strong winds, this was most likely an underestimation of what actually fell. The passage of the hurricane's eye was marked by diminished winds and a lack of rain, but <b>a</b> <b>drizzle</b> of ocean mist reportedly fell over the island. As Gonzalo struck at low tide, the effects of storm surge were minimal. At Esso Pier {{on the north side of}} the island, storm tides peaked at [...] above normal.|$|E
500|$|<b>A</b> <b>drizzle</b> {{started by}} mid-afternoon on 10 December and {{continued}} throughout the artillery bombardment, which was delivered by 24 field guns, four howitzers, and a 4.7-inch naval gun. In {{preparation for the}} attack, the soldiers bivouacked in the rain [...] from the Boer lines. Instead of [...] "softening" [...] the Boer positions, the explosions of lyddite shells against the facing slopes above their trenches merely alerted the Boers to the impending attack. As midnight approached, the rain increased to a downpour and the leading elements of the Highland Brigade commenced their advance towards their objective {{at the southern end}} of Magersfontein ridge. Wauchope had made a similar night march in his advance on Omdurman in 1898, but this time he was faced not by flat desert terrain and clear skies, but rather by torrential rain, rocky outcrops, and thorn scrub, which caused delays and annoyance. The thunderstorm and the high iron ore content of the surrounding hills played havoc with compasses and navigation.|$|E

5000|$|Oregon State {{entered the}} game on a four-game winning streak; Colorado State entered {{the game on}} a 24-game losing streak, the nation's longest major college losing streak. <b>A</b> <b>drizzling</b> rain soaked the field. Many reporters called the field [...] "sloppy." ...|$|R
2500|$|Many {{restaurants}} run by Mizrahi Jews and Arab {{citizens of}} Israel {{are dedicated to}} warm hummus, which may be served as chick peas softened with baking soda along with garlic, olive oil, cumin and tahini.

2500|$|For years hence, it was {{traditional}} {{to designate}} [...] "a greatest home game" [...] each season. In 1914, it was Georgia—a [...] "Rally 'Round the Rotunda" [...] won by UVA, 28–0, in <b>a</b> <b>drizzle,</b> as Robert Kent Gooch [...] "general-led his men with rare ability," [...] the Alumni News gushed. Betting was heavy on Yale for a 1915 game that ranked {{as the biggest}} all-time win at that stage of Virginia's history. No Southern team had ever defeated the Ivy League power until Virginia—led by quarterback Norborne Berkeley and Buck Mayer—won 10–0 in New Haven. Headlines in the Charlottesville Daily Progress read, [...] "Yale Bowl a Soup Tureen—Virginia Eleven Serves Dish of Bulldog Stew!" [...] The 1915 Virginia team was also the only team to beat the [...] "point-a-minute" [...] Commodores. The season's only loss was 9–0 on the road at Harvard. Harvard's only loss was to national champion Cornell. halfback Eugene N. [...] "Buck" [...] Mayer was the South's first consensus All-American.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{attack was}} made on Ennetières at [...] and repulsed but on the extreme right of the brigade, five platoons were spread across [...] to the {{junction}} with the 16th Brigade. The platoons had good observation to their fronts but were not in view {{of each other and}} in <b>a</b> <b>drizzle</b> of rain, the Germans attacked again at [...] The German attack was repulsed with reinforcements and German artillery began a bombardment of the Brigade positions from the north-east until dark, then sent about three battalions of the 52nd Infantry Brigade of the 25th Reserve Division forward in the dark, to rush the British positions. The German attack broke through and two companies of Reserve Infantry Regiment 125 entered Ennetières from the west; four companies of Reserve Infantry Regiment 122 and a battalion of Reserve Infantry Regiment 125 broke in from the south and [...] the British platoons were surrounded and captured. Another attack from the east, led to the British infantry east of the village retiring to {{the west side of the}} village, where they were surprised and captured by German troops advancing from La Vallée, which had fallen after [...] and who had been thought to be British reinforcements; some of the surrounded troops fought on until [...] next morning. The German infantry did not exploit the success and British troops on the northern flank were able to withdraw to a line [...] west of Prémesques, between La Vallée and Chateau d'Hancardry.|$|E

6000|$|... 'When last I saw him,' said Barnet, 'he was {{standing}} under the signpost {{at the crest}} of the hill, gazing wistfully, yet it seemed to me a little doubtfully, now towards Paris, and altogether heedless of <b>a</b> <b>drizzling</b> rain that was wetting him through and through....' ...|$|R
60|$|The Statutes fair, however, came in November, at Bestwood. It {{happened}} that Annie had the Monday night off. It was <b>a</b> <b>drizzling</b> ugly night, yet she dressed herself {{up and went}} to the fair ground. She was alone, but she expected soon to find a pal of some sort.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{from your}} son," [...] said the traveller. And as {{the rain was}} now much more than <b>a</b> <b>drizzle,</b> and as the wind was cold, he made his tale as short as possible.|$|E
60|$|Outside, {{the mist}} had become <b>a</b> <b>drizzle,</b> {{and as they}} went down the walk {{together}} beside the driveway she slipped her arm into his, pressing close to his side. Her intuition was perfect, the courage of her love sublime.|$|E

60|$|The {{following}} December, {{a day or}} {{two before}} Christmas, Mrs. Fellmer and her son were walking up and down the broad gravel path which bordered the east front of the house.

6000|$|<b>A</b> <b>drizzling,</b> cold Texas {{rain had}} begun to fall--an endless, lazy, unintermittent {{downfall}} that lowered the spirits of men and raised a reluctant steam from the warm stones of the streets and houses. Thus comes the [...] "norther" [...] dousing gentle spring and amiable autumn with the chilling salutes and adieux of coming and departing winter.|$|R
50|$|On Plant Field in <b>a</b> <b>drizzling</b> rain, Florida {{defeated}} the Wake Forest Demon Deacons 34-0, a surprising score. Fullback Tiny Chaplin {{was the star}} of the day; as well as the forward passes of captain Ark Newton, Edgar C. Jones on punt returns, and Cy Williams in the line. Bill Middlekauff was kept out of the lineup due to injures sustained versus Tech.|$|R
60|$|But as for Danby, {{the miserable}} Yankee grows sour on good cheer, and dries up the thinner for {{every drop of}} fat ale he imbibes. It is plain and demonstrable, that much ale {{is not good for}} Yankees, and {{operates}} differently upon them from what it does upon a Briton: ale must be drank in a fog and <b>a</b> <b>drizzle.</b>|$|E
60|$|That {{night was}} moonlight, cold, starry, {{with a silver}} sheen on the {{spectral}} spruces. During the night there came a change; it rained--first <b>a</b> <b>drizzle,</b> then a heavy downpour, and at five-thirty a roar of hail on the tent. This music did not last long. At seven o'clock the thermometer registered thirty-four degrees, {{but there was no}} frost. The morning was somewhat cloudy or foggy, with promise of clearing.|$|E
60|$|The Monday morning came. It {{was the end}} of September, and <b>a</b> <b>drizzle</b> of fine rain like veils round her, {{making her}} seem intimate, a world to herself. She walked forward to the new land. The old was blotted out. The veil would be rent that hid the new world.

60|$|On {{the evening}} {{preceding}} their removal {{it was getting}} dark betimes by reason of <b>a</b> <b>drizzling</b> rain which blurred the sky.

5|$|With {{four players}} out due to injury, the Commodores {{still managed to}} defeat the Cumberland Bulldogs 60–0 in <b>a</b> <b>drizzling</b> rain. Ray again scored four touchdowns.

5000|$|During {{the greater}} part of October, the {{squadron}} brought [...] "great discomfort" [...] to the enemy in many ways, and broke up the organization of his retreat towards the German frontier in spite of low clouds and <b>a</b> <b>drizzling</b> rain on many days. The squadron reported much materiel to British Intelligence which made it possible for ground units to attack in his weakest spots.|$|R
60|$|But he {{was very}} much in love. The next morning {{appeared}} in <b>a</b> <b>drizzle</b> of rain that followed the beautiful warmth of the day before. He had the coach all to himself, and in the damp and leathery solitude he drew out the little oval picture from beneath his shirt frill and looked long and fixedly with a fond and foolish joy at the innocent face, the blue eyes, the red, smiling lips depicted upon the satinlike, ivory surface.|$|E
60|$|Perfectly {{happy in}} this work, I {{believed}} {{my wife to}} be equally content, for she bravely declared that to tumble off a pullman {{in the middle of}} a moonless night, and help me set up a tent on the prairie grass was fun. She pretended to enjoy cooking our food at a smoking camp fire in <b>a</b> <b>drizzle</b> of rain; but I now know that she was longing for the comforts, the conveniences, the repose of West Salem.|$|E
60|$|The {{infantry}} halted {{about three}} thousand {{yards from the}} enemy's position, and the artillery, which numbered fourteen guns, trotted forward and came into action. All these movements, which had been very deliberately made, had taken a long time, and it was now nearly five o'clock. Dark thunder-clouds and <b>a</b> <b>drizzle</b> of rain descended on the silent Boer position, {{and the range of}} hills along which it stretched lay in deep shadow as if under the frown of Heaven. Our batteries also were ranged in this gloomy zone, but with the reserves and on the hill whence we were watching there was bright sunlight.|$|E
50|$|Rather than {{presenting}} {{only the}} cake {{itself in a}} ramekin or on a plate, the baker may choose {{to make it more}} appealing. Fresh raspberries, <b>a</b> <b>drizzling</b> of raspberry and/or chocolate sauce, and dustings of powdered sugar may be added to enhance flavor, or a sprig of mint may look more appealing as well. For a more intense chocolate taste, the baker may also add a tablespoon of strong coffee.|$|R
60|$|Paul {{had sunk}} into a sweet sleep, and dreamed {{that he was}} walking {{hand in hand with}} Florence through {{beautiful}} gardens, when they came to a large sunflower which suddenly expanded itself into a gong, and began to sound.

60|$|They congratulated {{themselves}} {{upon the}} precaution taken, {{before they had}} gone very far, for there was no moon, the sky was overcast, and <b>a</b> <b>drizzling</b> rain had begun to come down. They could hardly see their horses' heads, and had proceeded but a short distance, when it became necessary for their guide to light a torch. It took them, therefore, over two hours to reach the mountain farm.|$|R
