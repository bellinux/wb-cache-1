500|$|I was {{listening}} to the radio and heard 'Genius of Love', and I hadn't heard it in a long time. It reminded me of growing up and listening to the radio and that feeling the song gave me seemed to go with the melody and basic idea I had for [...] "Fantasy." [...] I initially told Dave about the idea, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> We called up the Tom Tom Club and they were really into it.|$|E
500|$|... "Medusa" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz and directed by Richard Compton. Reportedly, because {{of the scope of}} the episode, a [...] "huge budget" [...] was allotted for the entry. Because the episode was written to take place in a subway system, a set meeting the requirements of the script had to be created. The eventual set was designed to mirror the actual Boston subway, a system that serves more than 700,000 people a day. According to star Robert Patrick, [...] "They got us in there, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> and they built a huge subway tunnel set on a soundstage." [...] Patrick later described the set as [...] "the biggest damned thing I'd ever seen in my life." [...] In real life, the Boston subway system is [...] "fondly" [...] called the T, short for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. In [...] "Medusa", the [...] "T", was changed to an [...] "M" [...] "for fictional purposes".|$|E
500|$|Brown {{said the}} song was {{given to him by}} DJ Frank E {{while he was in the}} studio writing songs for other artists and himself. [...] "I heard the track and I was like man this is incredible. It kind of gave me the 'Forever' feeling so I wanted to do more of a song for my pop {{audience}}. I’ve been doing a lot of mix-tape stuff, a lot of urban records...the pop audience didn’t really have anything to gauge from so I really wanted to give them this and I feel like 'Yeah 3x' is something different, something new and it’s just [...] positive record. It’s not anything too over the top; it’s just right where it needs to be." [...] During a chat with fans on Ustream.tv on September 27, 2010, Brown said that {{the song was}} written in 15minutes; [...] "We actually got the beat <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> in no time. It was effortless. It was fun. It was sort of like when we wrote 'Forever', so I hope you guys like that record. It's more of a pop record, in the club record." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jones competed at the 2013 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials {{where she}} managed to qualify as the top seed through the round robin play which meant the team went {{directly}} to the finals. There she defeated Sherry Middaugh eight to four and won the right to represent Canada at the Olympics for the first time. [...] She skipped the Canadian women's team at the 2014 Winter Olympics to a Gold medal. [...] Jones is the first ever female skip in Olympic history to be undefeated throughout the tournament. The only male skip to achieve it being fellow Canadian Kevin Martin in 2010. After the win she said that [...] "We're Olympic gold medallists. It's something that you dream of for your entire life. It's what every athlete wants to do <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> today. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> in a way where we played so consistent all week.

2500|$|On October 15, 1965, Brian went to {{the studio}} with a 43-piece {{orchestra}} to record an instrumental piece entitled [...] "Three Blind Mice", which bore no musical connection to the nursery rhyme of the same name. Another instrumental, called [...] "Trombone Dixie", was recorded. According to Brian, [...] "I was just foolin' around one day, fuckin' around with the musicians, and I took that arrangement out of my briefcase <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> in 20 minutes.

2500|$|In 2013, Jesse Katz, {{a former}} Los Angeles Times reporter, {{said of the}} LA Times coverage: [...] "As an L.A. Times reporter, we saw this series in the San Jose Mercury News and kind of wonder how legit it was and kind of put it under a microscope, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> {{in a way that}} most of us who were {{involved}} in it, I think, would look back on that and say it was overkill. We had this huge team of people at the L.A. Times and kind of piled on to one lone muckraker up in Northern California." [...] And [...] "we really didn't do anything to advance his work or illuminate much to the story, and it was a really kind of tawdry exercise. ... And it ruined that reporter's career." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the sound of}} R.E.M.'s previous two records, the music of Monster consisted of distorted guitar tones, minimal overdubs, and touches of 1970s glam rock. Peter Buck described Monster as [...] "a 'rock' record, with the rock in quotation marks." [...] He explained, [...] "That's not what we started out to make, but that's certainly how it turned out to be. There's a nudge, nudge, wink, wink feel to the whole record. Like, it's a rock record, but is it really?" [...] Mike Mills told Time, [...] "On past albums we had been exploring acoustic instruments, trying to use the piano and mandolin, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> about all we wanted to do it. And you come back to the fact that playing loud electric-guitar music is about as fun as music can be." [...] Stipe's vocals were pushed back in the mix. Buck's guitar work on the album was inspired by the tremolo-heavy guitar playing of Glen Johansson from Echobelly, who supported R.E.M. for some of the Monster Tour.|$|E
2500|$|Zaghba (born 1995 in Fez, Morocco) was at {{the time}} of the attack living in east London where he worked in a fast food outlet. He also worked at an Islamic {{television}} channel in London. Zaghba was born to a Moroccan Muslim father and an Italian Catholic Christian mother who had converted to Islam to marry. Zaghba had dual Moroccan and Italian nationality. When his parents divorced, he went to Italy with his mother. In 2016, Zaghba was stopped at Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport by Italian officers who found ISIS-related materials on his mobile phone; he was stopped from continuing his journey to Istanbul. Italian authorities said Zaghba was monitored continuously while in Italy and that the UK was informed about him. Giuseppe Amato, an Italian prosecutor, said [...] "We did our best. We could just monitor and surveil... and send a note to British authorities, that's all we could do <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> Since he moved to London, he came back to Italy once in a while for a total of 10 days. And during those 10 days we never let him out of our sight." ...|$|E

"I know {{something}} of that," [...] returned Cheenbuk; [...] "we have no falls in our great salt lake, {{but we have}} plenty big lumps of ice, and when these are like to crush together we have {{to jump out of}} our kayaks and lift them out of the water--ho! <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> quick too, sometimes, or we get squeezed flat.

2500|$|... "Linda was {{a joy to}} work with. I {{remember}} we were doing a tracking shot, a camera car on tracks running about one hundred yards down this field. Linda and I were on this horse with no saddle, no reins, just the mane. If anybody fell, that camera truck is there to roll under. It was a very dodgey scene. You're galloping through gopher holes, etc. And they got the mares down at the far end. The stallion {{getting ready to go}} is smelling the mares and he's running like a bat out of hell and Linda's behind me saying, 'I'm very nervous about this horse.' And I said, 'Join the club. Just hang on and if you feel you can't do it, just don't do it. It's risky. There's no question about it, it's not a safe shot. What a horse is going to do, no one can tell.' But she was courageous, foolhardy or not, maybe me, too. She went ahead <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> I recall afterwards Loren Janes, my stunt man, came up and said,'You're crazy. I wouldn't have done that. It's too dangerous.' And he's probably right. I thought it was very foolish to have done it. Anyway, Linda was a gutsy little gal and she did it. So she was very pleasant to work with and very nice." ...|$|E
