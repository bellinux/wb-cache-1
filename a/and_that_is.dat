While the meeting time {{approaches}} ("Heaven's Cove"), Faythe decides {{that she wants to}} use the power of her royal status to change the world for good ("Begin Again"). At the amphitheater, Arhys changes his mind on the deal, and when Daryus shows up, they start a fight. Daryus overpowers Arhys and kills him ("The Path That Divides"), unaware that Xander followed them and saw the whole scene. As Xander runs to his father's dead body, Daryus sees the silhouette of someone approaching him. Assuming it to be Gabriel, he attempts to kill him, realising too late that it is actually Faythe ("The Walking Shadow"). Gabriel arrives at the scene and sees his dead brother and the dying Faythe. Covering Xander's ears, he unleashes a scream that causes Daryus to go deaf <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> heard by Nafaryus, Arabelle, and the entire town ("My Last Farewell").|$|E

There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E

5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E
5|$|In {{computational}} complexity theory, 2-satisfiability {{provides an}} example of an NL-complete problem, one that can be solved non-deterministically using a logarithmic amount of storage <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> among the hardest of the problems solvable in this resource bound. The set of all solutions to a 2-satisfiability instance can be given the structure of a median graph, but counting these solutions is #P-complete and therefore not expected to have a polynomial-time solution. Random instances undergo a sharp phase transition from solvable to unsolvable instances as the ratio of constraints to variables increases past 1, a phenomenon conjectured but unproven for more complicated forms of the satisfiability problem. A computationally difficult variation of 2-satisfiability, finding a truth assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied constraints, has an approximation algorithm whose optimality depends on the unique games conjecture, and another difficult variation, finding a satisfying assignment minimizing the number of true variables, is an important test case for parameterized complexity.|$|E

Deputy Mayor Svenn Kristiansen (Progress Party) speculated that normal hill ski jumping would be replaced with ski flying on the Olympic program and that it therefore {{would be necessary to}} build a ski flying hill in Oslo. In November 2004, a Norwegian Ski Federation committee concluded that a new hill in Rødkleiva should be prioritized <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> would cost between NOK300 and 400 million. The following month Minister of Culture Valgerd Svarstad Haugland (Christian Democratic Party) criticized the federation for allowing Bertil Pålsrud and Steinar Johannesen to hold key roles in the decision process, while both owned a 13.3-percent stake in Rødkleiva Skiflyging.|$|E

The rich could never change from their {{absentee}} landlord mentality that has stripped Ireland of its economic independence, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> why Swift spends {{the majority of his}} sermon discussing the poor. Swift proposes a remedy of sorts that would help the poor; they should be educated and the free travel of beggars should be restricted. These ideas were intended to limit the amount that the poor consumed in society, which, combined with a proposal for the poor to act more virtuously, should correct many of the problems that plague Ireland, but these ideas were never put into effect.|$|E
5|$|The 1962 {{edition of}} the Roman Missal, {{published}} {{a few months before}} the Second Vatican Council opened, was the last that presented the Mass as standardised in 1570 by Pope Pius V {{at the request of the}} Council of Trent <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> therefore known as the Tridentine Mass. Pope Pius V's Roman Missal was subjected to minor revisions by Pope Clement VIII in 1604, Pope Urban VIII in 1634, Pope Pius X in 1911, Pope Pius XII in 1955, and Pope John XXIII in 1962. Each successive edition was the ordinary form of the Roman Rite Mass until superseded by a later edition. When the 1962 edition was superseded by that of Paul VI, promulgated in 1969, its continued use at first required permission from bishops; but Pope Benedict XVI's 2007 motu proprio Summorum Pontificum allowed free use of it for Mass celebrated without a congregation and authorised parish priests to permit, under certain conditions, its use even at public Masses. Except for the scriptural readings, which Pope Benedict allowed to be proclaimed in the vernacular language, it is celebrated exclusively in liturgical Latin.|$|E

Contemptuously, Naritsugu announces that both {{the people and the}} samurai have only one purpose <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> to serve their lords. Shinzaemon counters by telling Naritsugu that lords cannot live without the support of the people and that, if a lord abuses his power, the people will always rise against him.

As the lord crawls away in mud crying and experiencing fear and pain for the first time, he thanks Shinzaemon for showing him excitement before Shinzaemon chops his head off.|$|E
