5|$|Another {{attraction}} is the Gomantong Caves, which {{is home to}} hundreds of thousands of swifts who build their nests high on cave walls and roofs. Other than swifts, the caves are also inhabited by millions of bats. Furthermore, the Sandakan Orchid House has a collection of rare orchids. Along the Labuk Road from Sandakan, there is <b>a</b> <b>crocodile</b> farm which houses about 1,000 crocodiles of various sizes.|$|E
5|$|Ampelosaurus atacis {{is known}} from a {{specimen}} from the Marnes Rouges Inférieures Formation. More specifically, {{it is known}} from the Bellevue layer, which has produced many vertebrate fossils. Even though it produced many vertebrates, the formation only has a few elements of plants and invertebrates. The vertebrates consist of numerous remains of Ampelosaurus, scales of Lepisosteus, shell fragments of an indeterminate turtle, cranial fragments and teeth of <b>a</b> <b>crocodile,</b> isolated theropod teeth, classified as Dromaeosauridae indet., an indeterminate ankylosaur, and a dentary and many postcranial elements of Rhabdodon priscus. The bird Gargantuavis philoinos, and dinosaur eggs have also been recovered.|$|E
5|$|Banjo and Kazooie are {{occasionally}} {{aided by}} their friend Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman who can use magical powers to transform them into several creatures like a termite, a pumpkin, a bee, a walrus, and <b>a</b> <b>crocodile.</b> These transformations {{have their own}} special features and allow the player to access areas that were previously inaccessible. For instance, the walrus can resist the effects of icy-cold water. Mumbo Tokens that are scattered throughout the game allow the transformation process. The game also includes cheats that the player can unlock by finding Gruntilda's spellbook, Cheato.|$|E

50|$|Duuz is a vegetarian, {{and does}} not like seafood. In regards to his appearance, he has {{different}} coloring for his scales and his eyes, and a tail more like <b>a</b> <b>crocodile's</b> rather than the short stub he had in Outlaw Star.|$|R
5|$|Belgian {{reporter}} Tintin {{and his dog}} Snowy {{travel to}} the Belgian Congo, where a cheering crowd of native Congolese greet them. Tintin hires a native boy, Coco, to assist him in his travels, and shortly after, Tintin rescues Snowy from <b>a</b> <b>crocodile.</b> A criminal stowaway attempts to kill Tintin, but monkeys throw coconuts at the stowaway that knock him unconscious. A monkey kidnaps Snowy, but Tintin saves him by disguising himself as another monkey.|$|E
5|$|Ford and Martin (2010) {{proposed}} that Psittacosaurus was semi-aquatic, swimming with its tail like <b>a</b> <b>crocodile,</b> and paddling and kicking. They based their interpretation on evidence including: the lacustrine (lake) depositional setting of many specimens; {{the position of}} the nostrils and eyes; interpretations of the motions of the arms and legs; tails with long chevrons (and with the bristles on the tail interpreted as possibly skin-covered, forming a fin), providing a propulsive surface; and the presence of gastroliths, interpreted as ballast. They further suggested that some species of Psittacosaurus were more terrestrial than others.|$|E
5|$|Look, I'm sorry you're dead OK? I do care. But to be {{perfectly}} honest with you, I don't care a lot. You had a choice, you took the drugs, you died. Are you seriously claiming no one warned you it was dangerous?... I mean, have you had a look at the world lately?... There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in <b>a</b> <b>crocodile</b> you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E
5000|$|Chompa Tong, a {{daughter}} of a king received two pets which one was a kitten and another was <b>a</b> <b>crocodile's</b> egg but she dropped the egg into the water where it grew into <b>a</b> powerful <b>crocodile</b> who {{could turn into a}} man and killed many women for food and fun. One day, Chompa Tong, was kidnapped and a young prince called Jak Jan, swam into the water to save her. Can Jak Jan save the princess from the terrible crocodile? ...|$|R
50|$|Sometime later, Nathan, {{is taking}} a group of {{tourists}} around the lake, telling them of the crocodiles that {{are believed to be}} extinct.

50|$|In Kraimbit, New Guinea, Dodwell was {{initiated}} into manhood by the crocodile {{people of the}} New Guinea lowlands. Her shoulder was scarred with a scaly pattern imitating one found on <b>a</b> <b>crocodile's</b> forehead. In Kenya, she was paralysed for ten days by the bite of a hunting spider.|$|R
5|$|The {{brain was}} {{slightly}} sigmoidal (S-shaped), without much {{expansion of the}} cerebral hemispheres, more like <b>a</b> <b>crocodile</b> than a bird. This {{is in keeping with}} the overall conservatism of non-coelurosaurian theropod brains. Acrocanthosaurus had large and bulbous olfactory bulbs, indicating a good sense of smell. Reconstructing the semicircular canals of the ear, which control balance, shows that the head was held at a 25° angle below horizontal. This was determined by orienting the endocast so that the lateral semicircular canal was parallel to the ground, as it usually is when an animal is in an alert posture.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The teeth of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more visible than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The teeth on the lower jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper teeth are visible when the mouth is closed. The teeth on the lower jaw of <b>a</b> <b>crocodile</b> fit into grooves {{on the outside of the}} top jaw making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E
5|$|How {{were such}} effects produced, {{and how did}} they look? The {{crocodile}} etc. obviously used the floor trap, but was it an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or a man in <b>a</b> <b>crocodile</b> suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Irwin {{appeared}} in a cameo role in the Eddie Murphy film Dr. Dolittle 2, in which an alligator warns Dolittle that he knows Irwin is going to grab him and is prepared to attack when he does, but Dolittle fails to warn Irwin in time. Irwin's only starring feature film role was in 2002's , which was released to mixed reviews. In the film Irwin (who portrayed himself and performed numerous stunts) mistakes some CIA agents for poachers. He sets out {{to stop them from}} capturing <b>a</b> <b>crocodile,</b> which, unknown to him, has actually swallowed a tracking transmitter. The film won the Best Family Feature Film award for a comedy film at the Young Artist Awards. The film was produced on a budget of about US$12million, and has grossed $33million. To promote the film, Irwin was featured in an animated short produced by Animax Entertainment for Intermix.|$|E
5|$|Ramudu meets a Nepali sorcerer {{during the}} latter's magic {{show in a}} street. The sorcerer, who is ordered by Goddess Pathala Bhairavi during his prayers to {{sacrifice}} an intelligent and brave young man before her to be granted a statuette which grants any wish, feels that Ramudu is suitable for the sacrifice. While taking a holy bath in the nearby pond, Ramudu kills <b>a</b> <b>crocodile</b> that immediately transforms into a woman after being killed. The woman informs Ramudu that he had freed her from a hermit's curse and also reveals the sorcerer's intentions. Just before the sacrifice, Ramudu sacrifices the sorcerer and wins the statuette, consequently amassing the wealth {{equal to that of}} the king. In return, the king lives up to his promise and accepts Indu's wishes to marry Ramudu.|$|E
5|$|Ambulocetus natans, which lived about 49 {{million years}} ago, was {{discovered}} in Pakistan in 1994. It was probably amphibious, and looked like <b>a</b> <b>crocodile.</b> In the Eocene, ambulocetids inhabited the bays and estuaries of the Tethys Ocean in northern Pakistan. The fossils of ambulocetids are always found in near-shore shallow marine deposits associated with abundant marine plant fossils and littoral molluscs. Although they are found only in marine deposits, their oxygen isotope values indicate that they consumed water {{with a range of}} degrees of salinity, some specimens showing no evidence of sea water consumption and others none of fresh water consumption at the time when their teeth were fossilized. It is clear that ambulocetids tolerated a wide range of salt concentrations. Their diet probably included land animals that approached water for drinking, or freshwater aquatic organisms that lived in the river. Hence, ambulocetids represent the transition phase of cetacean ancestors between freshwater and marine habitat.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by <b>a</b> <b>crocodile</b> when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E
5|$|Carte's London {{house was}} at the Adelphi, {{not far from the}} Savoy. Passionate about the visual arts as well as the {{performing}} arts, Carte invited his friend, the artist James McNeill Whistler, to decorate the house. Whistler had the entire billiard room painted the colour of the billiard cloth, and elsewhere painted his favourite yellow with his own hand. Equally enthusiastic for technological innovation, Carte installed a lift, the first in a private house in England. Around 1890, he bought a small island in the River Thames, between Weybridge and Shepperton, called Folly Eyot, which he renamed D'Oyly Carte Island. He wanted to use the island as an annex to his new Savoy Hotel, but the local authorities refused to grant him a drinks licence for the property. Instead, he built Eyot House, a large house and garden on the island, that he used as a residence. In later years, Carte displayed his macabre sense of humour by keeping <b>a</b> <b>crocodile</b> on the island.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched New Guinea {{crocodiles}} feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, freshwater snails, frogs, {{fish and}} small mammals. As they grow, {{so does the}} size of their prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they still will eat anything of a worthwhile size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely fish, caught by sweeping the snout sideways and snapping at the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. <b>A</b> <b>crocodile</b> catches its prey by stealth with a flick of its head, impaling it with its sharp teeth and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move sideways to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the prey {{to the back of the}} mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile is surprisingly agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also probe into the mud at the bottom of a river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and molluscs.|$|E
