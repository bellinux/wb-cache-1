25|$|Carburizing is {{a process}} used to case-harden steel with a carbon content between 0.1 and 0.3 wt% C. In this process steel is {{introduced}} to a carbon rich environment and elevated temperatures for {{a certain amount of}} time, and then quenched so that the carbon is locked in the structure; one of the simpler procedures is repeatedly to heat a part with an <b>acetylene</b> <b>torch</b> set with a fuel-rich flame and quench it in a carbon-rich fluid such as oil.|$|E
500|$|On September 20, 1967, two Bureau of Forestry {{employees}} {{attempted to}} remove a metal ladder from a [...] metal storage tank for jet fuel at the northern jet engine test cell. Both were killed in an explosion when the <b>acetylene</b> <b>torch</b> cut through the tank wall and ignited fumes inside it. A tract within the Elk State Forest at {{the northern edge of}} the wild area is known as Noble-Chambers Memorial Forest in their memory. Although Fergus reports entering a bunker in his 2002 book, and Young describes a bunker's slit windows in his 2008 book, as of 2010 the southern bunker was covered with earth, and the northern bunker is still completely intact and can be entered.|$|E

50|$|Actinic {{conjunctivitis}} is an {{inflammation of}} the eye contracted from prolonged exposure to actinic (ultraviolet) rays. Symptoms are redness and swelling of the eyes. Most often the condition is caused by prolonged exposure to Klieg lights, therapeutic lamps, or <b>acetylene</b> <b>torches.</b> Other names for the condition include Klieg conjunctivitis, eyeburn, arc-flash, welder's conjunctivitis, flash keratoconjunctivitis, actinic ray ophthalmia, x-ray ophthalmia, and ultraviolet ray ophthalmia.|$|R
50|$|The Pittsburgh {{gasometer}} explosion, or Equitable Gas explosion, was {{an accident}} {{that took place in}} Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on the morning of November 14, 1927. A huge cylindrical gasometer, the largest in the world at that time at , developed a leak, and repairmen were sent to fix it. The exact cause of the explosion is not known, but some of those repairing the leak were using <b>acetylene</b> <b>torches.</b>|$|R
50|$|In modern times, much modern wrought {{work is done}} {{using the}} air hammer and the <b>acetylene</b> <b>torch.</b> A number of modern sculptors have worked in iron {{including}} Pablo Picasso, Julio González and David Smith.|$|E
50|$|In 1938 Ernest {{was working}} for Anderton's Welding Works. An apprentice, John Holsted, was working with an <b>acetylene</b> <b>torch</b> under a car when it caught fire. Ernest went to his rescue, {{suffering}} severe burns as a result.|$|E
50|$|The Minneapolis Fire Department quickly {{determined}} {{the cause of}} the fire as arson. Shortly thereafter, two juveniles were arrested and later convicted of setting the fire, using an <b>acetylene</b> <b>torch</b> found at the partially demolished Donaldson's site.|$|E
5000|$|Back at the facility, the Colonel has summoned men to {{burn through}} the lab door with <b>acetylene</b> <b>torches.</b> Philpot ignores her threats from outside and turns from {{repairing}} The Hoop to fixing the Z-29, an early {{prototype of the}} X-54. The Colonel mentions that if Philpot is trying to rescue Rip and company, he won't make it in time. Philpot replies that [...] "time is the operative word!" ...|$|R
50|$|Other {{methods of}} {{cracking}} a safe generally involve damaging the safe {{so that it}} is no longer functional. These methods may involve explosives or other devices to inflict severe force and damage the safe so it may be opened. Examples of penetration tools include <b>acetylene</b> <b>torches,</b> drills and thermic lances. This method requires care as the contents of the safe may be damaged. Safe-crackers can use what are known as jam shots to blow off the safe's doors.|$|R
50|$|Since their introduction, {{portable}} cut-off saws {{have made}} many building site jobs easier. With these saws, lightweight steel fabrication previously performed in workshops using stationary power bandsaws or cold saws {{can be done}} on-site. Abrasive saws have replaced more expensive and hazardous <b>acetylene</b> <b>torches</b> in many applications, such as cutting rebar. In addition, these saws allow construction workers to cut through concrete, asphalt, and pipe on job sites in a more precise manner than is possible with heavy equipment.|$|R
5000|$|On 28 December 2008, {{members of}} Voina welded shut the {{entrance}} {{doors of the}} restaurant Oprichnik, using an <b>acetylene</b> <b>torch</b> and metal sheets.

5000|$|Fred Wilson, an African-American sculptor, {{displayed}} {{an installation}} at the 2003 Venice Biennale that incorporated blackamoors. Wilson placed wooden blackamoors carrying <b>acetylene</b> <b>torches</b> and fire extinguishers. Wilson noted that such figures are so common in Venice {{that few people}} notice them. He said, [...] "They are in hotels everywhere in Venice ... which is great, because {{all of a sudden}} you see them everywhere. I wanted it to be visible, this whole world which sort of just blew up for me." ...|$|R
25|$|Materials used in vaults and vault doors {{have changed}} as well. The earlier vaults had steel doors, but because these {{could easily be}} cut by torches, {{different}} materials were tried. Massive cast iron doors had more resistance to <b>acetylene</b> <b>torches</b> than steel. The modern preferred vault door material is the same concrete as used in the vault wall panels. It is usually clad in steel for cosmetic reasons.The vault is a storage to store money and many valuable materials submitted {{by the members of}} bank.|$|R
5000|$|On 30 November 1952, {{while in}} Sasebo for an availability, Ashtabula was damaged by twin explosions caused by <b>acetylene</b> <b>torches</b> which ignited {{gasoline}} fumes in her forward hold ( [...] deck log of 11/30/1952). Three sailors were killed, and the forward well deck was seriously damaged, the weather deck curling {{back towards the}} superstructure and the port hull blown open to the sea. After three months of work at Sasebo, the ship sailed to Long Beach for further alterations. In September 1953, {{she returned to the}} western Pacific (WestPac) and resumed replenishment duties.|$|R
50|$|Following {{shakedown}} {{training off}} the California coast, the escort carrier entered the repair base at San Diego, California. There, on 4 January 1944, gasoline was inadvertently {{dumped into the}} water around the forward part of the ship, on the starboard side. <b>Acetylene</b> <b>torch</b> sparks ignited the volatile mixture, and flames quickly spread from the bow to frame 82, engulfing the forward galley walkway and the island superstructure. Yardcraft and the ship's crew battled the flames and soon had the fire under control, but not before two men had died.|$|E
50|$|The method {{does not}} require the use of {{non-volatile}} materials such as chrome, possibly reducing contamination problems in some applications. The ability to control the etching direction and speed with an applied voltage or electrode configuration, as with electrochemical machining, gives additional capabilities not available with isotropic chemical-only approaches. Dry processing methods such as hot oxygen or plasmas can also burn off the graphite faster than the diamond, as can a simple <b>acetylene</b> <b>torch.</b> These require higher temperatures and {{do not have the same}} high selectivity that can be achieved with the electrochemical approach.|$|E
5000|$|A keeper {{managed the}} light and {{occupied}} the building's two rooms. As the islands of Culebra and Vieques became both military posts and tourists destinations, the lighthouse {{played a role in}} safeguarding the increasing number of trips across the passage. Traveler's accounts refer to its beauty and powerful light over the waters. In 1937, as part of the changes that Gustaf Dalén affected in the gas and lighthouse technologies, the authorities installed an automated <b>acetylene</b> <b>torch.</b> Six years later, the building was closed and boarded. In 1965 the light was replaced with a range light called [...] "Vieques Southwest Channel Range Front Light". The original structure was destroyed in 1966.|$|E
50|$|On October 24, 2006, scrap dealers were {{cutting up}} a boiler in the {{basement}} for salvage with <b>acetylene</b> <b>torches</b> that sparked a large fire. The fire was allowed {{to get out of}} control and gutted the building. At its peak, the fire, which started {{in the basement}} at around 3 pm, was a five-alarm fire, the Chicago Fire Department's highest level of alert, with over 250 firefighters responding. Following the fire, the surviving shell of the building was too unstable to save and was demolished. At the time of the fire there was no insurance on the building.|$|R
50|$|Some {{newspapers}} ran {{a photograph}} taken {{soon after the}} accident, which showed a view into the street where emergency vehicles and police were gathering; it had been transmitted over the telephone to the NEA Service in San Francisco. Approximately 50 doctors used the station platform to render first aid, and the wreckage was then cleared using <b>acetylene</b> <b>torches</b> and hand carts while three blocks of Seventh Avenue were blocked off to enable removal of the debris. Full service on the subway was restored about 12 hours after the accident, but a section of 40th Street west of Broadway remained closed because the crash had damaged its underpinnings.|$|R
25|$|More {{remains were}} found {{the day after}} the ship's bell was rediscovered. These {{represented}} six or seven crewmen, and were found among the wreckage of the central portion of the ship near the conning tower. The bones were found in a confused mass, scorched by fire, and many were incomplete or fractured. Some were skulls which had portions missing, and many were small fragments. Workers reported that additional remains were wedged tightly in twisted masses of steel, and could not be easily removed without the use of <b>acetylene</b> <b>torches.</b> The remains of another three to four men were found on the central superstructure on July 24. Again, some showed the action of fire.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Porcupine {{designed a}} suit of battle armor for himself composed of steel and advanced plastics that enhanced his strength and durability. The armor {{is equipped with a}} wide variety of offensive and defensive weapons built in. The outer surface of the armor is covered with razor-tipped metal quill-like projections which can be fired at opponents. The armor's other capabilities include laser beams, concussive bombs, small rockets, tear gas, sleeping gas, smoke screens, <b>acetylene</b> <b>torch</b> flames, liquid cement, wheels giving off hypnotic lights, and high voltage blasts of electricity. The battle-suit included belt jets which allowed him to fly for short distances. Gentry was a skilled automotive mechanic, and had a master's degree in engineering.|$|E

5000|$|Atomic {{hydrogen}} welding (AHW) is an {{arc welding}} process that uses an arc between two tungsten electrodes in a shielding atmosphere of hydrogen. The process {{was invented by}} Irving Langmuir {{in the course of}} his studies of atomic hydrogen. The electric arc efficiently breaks up the hydrogen molecules, which later recombine with tremendous release of heat, reaching temperatures from 3400 to 4000 °C. Without the arc, an oxyhydrogen torch can only reach 2800 °C. [...] This is the third-hottest flame after dicyanoacetylene at 4987 °C and cyanogen at 4525 °C. An <b>acetylene</b> <b>torch</b> merely reaches 3300 °C. This device may be called an atomic hydrogen torch, nascent hydrogen torch or Langmuir torch. The process was also known as arc-atom welding.|$|E
5000|$|For example, for his {{installation}} at the 2003 Venice Biennale he {{employed a}} tourist {{to pretend to}} be an African street vendor selling fake designer bags — in fact his own designs. He also incorporated [...] "blackamoors", sculptures of black people in the role of servants, into the show. Such figures were often used as stands for lights. Wilson placed his wooden blackamoors carrying <b>acetylene</b> <b>torches</b> and fire extinguishers.

60|$|The fair {{was in full}} swing. The {{noise was}} deafening. Steam bands thundered out the popular tunes of the moment, and to their din merry-go-rounds were turning. At the door of booths men vociferously importuned the passers-by to enter. From the {{shooting}} saloons came a continual spatter of toy rifles. Linking up these sounds, were {{the voices of the}} serried crowd that surged along the central avenue, and the shuffle of their myriad feet. The night was lurid with <b>acetylene</b> <b>torches,</b> which flamed with a dull unceasing roar. It was a curious sight, half gay, half sordid. The throng seemed bent with a kind of savagery upon amusement, as though, resentful of the weary round of daily labour, it sought by a desperate effort to be merry.|$|R
5000|$|Helenite, {{also known}} as Mount St. Helens obsidian, emerald obsidianite, and ruby obsidianite, is an {{artificial}} glass made from the fused volcanic rock dust from Mount St. Helens and marketed as a gemstone. Helenite was first created accidentally after the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980. Workers from the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company were attempting to salvage equipment damaged after the volcanic eruption. Using <b>acetylene</b> <b>torches,</b> they noticed that the intense heat was melting the nearby volcanic ash and rock and turning it a greenish color. The silica, aluminium, iron, and trace amounts of chromium and copper present in the rocks and ash in the area, combined with {{the heat of the}} torches, transformed the volcanic particles into a compound that would be later commercially replicated as helenite.|$|R
5000|$|They Stooge to Conga {{has been}} {{consistently}} ranked as the most violent Stooge film of the Curly Howard era (1934-1947). DVD Talk critic Stuart Galbraith IV writes that, in its brief 15½ minutes, the film [...] "offers several startling moments, none more gleefully sadistic as when Curly, scaling an electrical pole, within a few seconds manages to puncture the top of Moe's head, an eye, and an ear with a climbing spike, all with cringe-inducing 'ker-CHUNK' sound effects." [...] Moe also gets pulled through lath and plaster, with a real wooden pillar unintentionally landing on his neck. Curly gets his share of abuse, via electrocution, falling off a telephone pole, severe nose twisting, and getting singed via an <b>acetylene</b> <b>torch.</b>|$|E
50|$|Patrick Leonard was an Irish politician, {{businessman}} and landowner. He owned three farms near Dublin and {{was involved in}} moving cattle between the west of Ireland and Dublin. In 1915 he was elected President of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. Leonard was an early pioneer of the car in Ireland. He suffered a serious accident in 1910 when he was injured by an explosion in an <b>acetylene</b> <b>torch</b> which he was using at his home. He was also injured in another accident at home while using explosives to remove a tree trunk in the grounds of his house. During the Easter Rising of 1916, Leonard, travelling with his son Mark, was told to stop at a road-block by rebels. He refused {{to do so and}} was shot at, leading to his son's arm being injured.|$|E

2500|$|The {{removal from}} {{power of the}} Ngô family was greeted with {{widespread}} joy by the public of South Vietnam. Large and spontaneous street demonstrations occurred and {{the offices of the}} Times of Vietnam, the propaganda mouthpiece of Nhu and his wife, were burned. Young men wielding <b>acetylene</b> <b>torches</b> cut off the feet of the statues of the Trưng Sisters before the statues were hauled down with a cable around their necks. The Trưng Sisters were a 3rd-century AD pair who are venerated in Vietnam for their role in driving Chinese occupiers from the country, but Madame Nhu had modeled their features on her own as she fancied herself as a modern-day reincarnation. Elsewhere, crowds smashed windows and pulled down government flags from buildings and ransacked any building associated with Nhu. The tension released by the downfall of the regime sparked off celebrations rivaled only by Tết New Year celebrations.|$|R
50|$|Early {{one morning}} in 1981, other {{visitors}} to Palmyra, sailors Robert and Sharon Jordan, from Durban, South Africa, found Muff Graham's skull and other skeletal remains in the surf near a large metal container.
