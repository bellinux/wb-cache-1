5|$|The Allied Expeditionary Air Force (AEAF) {{undertook}} over 3,200 photo reconnaissance sorties from April 1944 {{until the}} start of the invasion. Photos of the coastline were taken at extremely low altitude to show the invaders the terrain, obstacles on the beach, and defensive structures such as bunkers and gun emplacements. Inland terrain, bridges, troop emplacements, and buildings were also photographed, in many cases from several angles, to give the Allies <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> as possible. Members of Combined Operations Pilotage Parties clandestinely prepared detailed harbour maps, including depth soundings. At Gold, frogmen discovered the shore between Asnelles and La Rivière was soft and could not support the weight of tanks. Twelve Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVREs) were fitted with bobbins to overcome this problem by deploying a roll of matting over the soft surface. The material would then be left in place to create a route for more conventional tanks.|$|E

5|$|When Obsidian were {{preparing}} to present Knights of the Old Republic II at E3 2004, they tried to fit <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> as they could, saying that it {{would need to be}} a duration of 30 minutes as it was the only E3 event it would be showcased at; however, due to the limited time frame, they would have to cut it down to a five- to ten-minute presentation. During this time, none of the levels Obsidian designed were ready to be shown, so they picked three levels, and put them through a schedule to finish them on time. The demo was finished {{a few days before the}} event, and the game was presented in May 2004. The first trailer for Knights of the Old Republic II was later unveiled in July 2004, and the official website was launched in October.|$|E
40|$|To gather <b>as</b> <b>much</b> {{necessary}} <b>information</b> <b>as</b> possible of {{the visual}} world, and neglect <b>as</b> <b>much</b> unnecessary <b>information</b> <b>as</b> possible, the visual system has undergone an impressive optimization {{in the course of}} evolution which is fascinating, in each detail that is examined. A few aspects will be described in this chapter. Similar limitations may exist in machine vision, and comparisons to the solutions developed in the visual system in the course of 5 billion years of evolution might provide some insights...|$|R

5|$|By {{the evening}} of 4 June, the Allied {{meteorological}} team, headed by Group Captain James Stagg of the Royal Air Force, predicted that the weather would improve sufficiently so that the invasion could go ahead on 6 June. He met Eisenhower and other senior commanders at their headquarters at Southwick House in Hampshire to discuss the situation. General Montgomery and Major General Walter Bedell Smith, Eisenhower's chief of staff, were eager to launch the invasion. Admiral Bertram Ramsay was prepared to commit his ships, while Air Chief Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory {{expressed concern that the}} conditions would be unfavourable for Allied aircraft. After much discussion, Eisenhower decided that the invasion should go ahead. Allied control of the Atlantic meant that German meteorologists did not have access to <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> as the Allies on incoming weather patterns. As the Luftwaffe meteorological centre in Paris predicted two weeks of stormy weather, many Wehrmacht commanders left their posts to attend war games in Rennes, and men in many units were given leave. Marshal Erwin Rommel returned to Germany for his wife's birthday and to meet Hitler to try to get more Panzers.|$|E

25|$|BITS {{includes}} a built-in mechanism for error handling and recovery attempts. Errors {{can be either}} fatal or transient; either moves a job to the respective state. A transient error is a temporary error that resolves itself after some time. For a transient error, BITS waits {{for some time and}} then retries. For fatal errors, BITS transfers control of the job to the creating application, with <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> regarding the error as it can provide.|$|E
25|$|When visible GPS {{satellites}} {{are close}} {{together in the}} sky (i.e., small angular separation), the DOP values are high; when far apart, the DOP values are low. Conceptually, satellites that are close together cannot provide <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> as satellites that are widely separated. Low DOP values represent a better GPS positional accuracy due to the wider angular separation between the satellites used to calculate GPS receiver position. HDOP, VDOP, PDOP and TDOP are respectively Horizontal, Vertical, Position (3-D) and Time Dilution of Precision.|$|E
25|$|Voyager 2s closest {{approach}} to Neptune occurred on August 25, 1989. Because {{this was the}} last planet of the Solar System that Voyager 2 could visit, the Chief Project Scientist, his staff members, and the flight controllers decided to also perform a close fly-by of Triton, the larger of Neptune's two originally known moons, so as to gather <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> on Neptune and Triton as possible, regardless of Voyager 2's departure angle from the planet. This was just like the case of Voyager 1's encounters with Saturn and its massive moon Titan.|$|E

However, the Up Next feature does not include features that used to be found in iTunes DJ, such as the ability for guests to request songs, does not provide <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> as the playlist view, and requires juggling multiple windows and floating dialogs to perform similar tasks.|$|E
25|$|The soundtrack for Lord of the Rings Online has {{received}} much praise for its quality and variety. It features compositions from Turbine composer Stephen Digregorio {{as well as}} original songs from acclaimed video game composer Chance Thomas. Other composers include Geoff Scott, Brad Spears, and Egan Budd. According to Thomas, all references that {{were made to the}} music of the peoples of Middle-earth in the books were used to extrapolate <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> as possible about the instruments and styles that each race would have used to create their music. This information was then used as the base for creating the score. Additionally, 61 songs from the game were made available for free in mp3 format using a download manager released by Turbine.|$|E
25|$|Silicon Dreams can {{be played}} as three {{separate}} games, but to obtain a maximum score the games must be completed in order, carrying the score from one adventure to the next. Points are not scored for collecting treasures, but rather for doing specific tasks helping to satisfy {{the goal of the}} individual game. For Snowball the goal is to get to the main control room and prevent the starship Snowball 9 from crashing into a star. For Return to Eden the goal is to get into the city of Enoch and stop the robots from destroying Snowball 9. And for Worm in Paradise the goal is to find <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> about the city as possible, obtain money, and then {{become a member of the}} governing party of Eden, saving the planet in the process.|$|E

25|$|This {{challenge}} {{was an early}} start for the 4 remaining finalists Bill, Sophie, Fenton and David. It began at the fish markets in Sydney's Chinatown where Ben explained the art of finding a fresh fish. Each finalist asked around to find out <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> as they could about a fish they had never cooked before. Fenton {{was so impressed with}} the filleting of the salmon that he wanted to meet the man responsible. Turned out it was the No. 1 salmon filleter in NSW. At the docks, 4 BBQ's were set up and each contestant was given 60 seconds to look down the barrel of the camera and talk about how they would prepare this fish, as though they were hosting a show. This was a test to see how much of the information they could retain and deliver to an audience in a simple to understand language. A Teppanyaki Chef came out and gave the finalists a crash course in the ancient Japanese technique. For the final challenge the remaining 4 were taken to a Teppanyaki restaurant and asked to cook a meal for the judges using the technique. Each contestant was judged on the ability to talk and cook at the same time while using techniques that they were all unfamiliar with. The judges then decided they would send one home who they thought was 'throwing' the contest.|$|E
500|$|To protect <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> {{concerning}} the episode as possible, {{the final scene}} of [...] "Army of Ghosts" [...] was withheld. The BBC website's Fear Forecasters, a panel who rate the episodes, {{were not allowed to}} see [...] "Doomsday" [...] before its airing, and access to copies was restricted; the website thus does not have a Fear Forecast for the episode. Despite this, the Dalek Sec prop, which had been previously unused in the series, had invaded the stage at the 2006 BAFTA Television Awards while the production team were collecting an award. A similar moratorium would be placed on the following series' finale, [...] "Last of the Time Lords".|$|E
500|$|John {{watches as}} his father is crowned Henry IV of England and Harry is made Prince of Wales, but remains sceptical that his family has a more {{immediate}} claim to the crown than others in their family. The new king's supporters insist Henry kill Richard and others who oppose him, but Henry resists the calls for violence. Henry deals with opposition to his rule {{in the form of}} rebellions, imposters, and men who expected him to right every wrong in the kingdom. Amidst these events, John grows up under the fostership of various households. John is a talented student, but is more interested in the problems of the realm than mere writings of long dead men. He {{is the only one of}} Henry IV's sons interested in crown finances, and acquires <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> on the running of government as possible.|$|E

[...] One side of the debate holds, with the longstanding opinion of 20th-century scholarship, that in Papias' day written statements were held at a lower value than oral statements. [...] The other side observes that [...] "living voice" [...] was a topos, an established phrase referring to personal instruction and apprenticeship, and thus Papias indicates his preference for personal instruction over isolated book learning.|$|R
