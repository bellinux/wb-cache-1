25|$|The {{human form}} of OSM was {{originally}} isolated in 1986 from the growth media of PMA treated U-937 histiocytic lymphoma cells by {{its ability to}} inhibit the growth of cell lines established from melanomas and other solid tumours. A robust protein, OSM is stable between pH2 and 11 and resistant to heating for one hour at 56°C. A partial amino acid sequence allowed the isolation of human OSM cDNA and subsequently genomic clones. The full cDNA clone of hOSM encodes a 252 amino <b>acid</b> <b>precursor,</b> the first 25 amino acids of which functions as a secretory signal peptide, which on removal yields the soluble 227 amino acid pro-OSM. Cleavage of the C-terminal most 31 residues at a trypsin like cleavage site yields the fully active 196 residue form. Two potential N-glycosylation sites are present in hOSM {{both of which are}} retained in the mature form.|$|E

40|$|The organic haze of {{aerosols}} that shrouds the Saturnian moon Titan {{has previously}} been studied by both observations and laboratory simulation experiments. Here we report the abiotic formation of amino <b>acid</b> <b>precursors</b> in complex organic molecules during experimental simulation of the environment near Titan’s surface with proton irradiation. Pyrolysis of the organic molecules formed in the simulated Titan atmosphere by proton irradiation at 600 °C yielded compounds that contained HCN and NH 3 (m/z = 27 and 17). These experimental {{results are consistent with}} the molecular information obtained by pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (pyrolysis GC/MS) of samples collected by the Huygens probe to Titan. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and three-dimensional atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the irradiation products reveal nanometer-scale filaments and globules in complex amorphous structures (approximately 1000 Da). Isotope probing experiments by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) show that oxygen atoms were incorporated into the racemic amino acids by hydrolysis of 18 O-labeled water. We suggest that the amino <b>acid</b> <b>precursors</b> possibly formed after water hydrolysis, as suggested in a previous observational study (C. A. Griffith, T. Owen, T. R. Geballe, J.
