5|$|As {{a result}} of the dry climate, timber—a main {{component}} in building earthquake-resistant homes—is scarce in Qayen; homes are instead constructed of adobe. The inhabitants of the poverty-stricken region rely on subsistence farming, raising livestock and crops such as wheat and saffron. When the earthquake struck, much of the population was <b>already</b> <b>working</b> in the fields; for the most part, these people survived. Many of those treated for injuries were found to be undernourished.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1929–1930, Maybeck's Wyntoon {{masterpiece}} burned down, possibly from a kitchen fire. Time magazine reported Hearst's losses at $300,000 to $500,000, including portions of his art collection. In early 1930, Hearst contracted to have Morgan design an even larger castle as replacement. Morgan was <b>already</b> <b>working</b> for Hearst on Hearst Castle in San Simeon and nearly finished with The Hacienda near King City.|$|E
5|$|The Haitian {{government}} did not request international assistance, although The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Haitian Red-Cross, which were <b>already</b> <b>working</b> in Haiti, took on some supporting roles. In response to local flooding, the Jacmel Regional branch of the Red Cross distributed an additional 400 water purification tablets, 11 boxes of high-energy biscuits, and 10 boxes of body soap.|$|E

5|$|All Star Pro-Wrestling was {{announced}} in January 1999 as part of Square's desire to expand into more diverse game genres on the PlayStation 2 than their usual role-playing games. While DreamFactory developed most of Square's previous fighting games (namely Tobal No. 1, Tobal 2, and Ehrgeiz), Square decided to develop a wrestling game internally as Dream Factory was <b>already</b> <b>working</b> on The Bouncer, another Square title. The game was produced by Yusuke Hirata of Parasite Eve 2 fame, head of Square's Osaka-based fifth production team. The score, which was never released in album form, consists mostly of rock music and was composed by Tsuyoshi Sekito, Kenichiro Fukui, and Kumi Tanioka.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Winton {{cancelled}} {{a trip to}} a Swiss {{holiday resort}} to go to Prague, having heard of a growing refugee crisis resulting from the German occupation of Czechoslovakia from a friend. His friend was working in the British embassy for the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia, which was <b>already</b> <b>working</b> to help adults escape from Czechoslovakia. When Winton learned that refugee children could not leave unless accompanied, he decided to arrange their evacuation to Britain. While the Winton evacuations later became known by the collective label of the children's Kindertransports, which were officially being organised elsewhere in other countries, no official Kindertransports had been arranged in Prague at that time.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, after a one-month {{university}} trip to Tours, France, Ebner {{began studying}} Romance languages, German philology, and translation at the University of Vienna. At {{this time he}} was <b>already</b> <b>working</b> for a literary circle and Viennese literature magazine. After graduation in 1988 and 1989 he concentrated on various professional careers, such as translation, foreign language teaching and IT projects. In the 1990s, Ebner published articles and books on software and networking topics; while these books were written in German, he also wrote some articles in English. In 1999, he spent six weeks in North Carolina, and was the co-author of a book in English about PC servers.|$|E

5|$|Monsanto was <b>already</b> <b>working</b> on a key {{component}} of the device. In April 1943, Robert Serber had proposed that instead of relying on spontaneous fission, the chain reaction inside the bomb should be triggered by a neutron initiator. The best-known neutron sources were radium-beryllium and polonium-beryllium. The later was chosen as it had a 140-day half life, which made it intense enough to be useful but long-lived enough to be stockpiled. Thomas brought in Monsanto to work on the development of techniques to industrially refine polonium for use with beryllium in the urchin detonators.|$|E
5|$|Steven Soderbergh {{had been}} {{interested}} in making a film about the drug wars for some time but {{did not want to}} make one about addicts. Producer Laura Bickford obtained the rights to the United Kingdom mini-series Traffik (1989) and liked its structure. Soderbergh, who had seen the mini-series in 1990, started looking for a screenwriter to adapt it into a film. They read a script by Stephen Gaghan called Havoc, about upper-class white kids in Palisades High School doing drugs and getting involved with gangs. Soderbergh approached Gaghan to work on his film, but found he was <b>already</b> <b>working</b> for producer/director Edward Zwick. Bickford and Soderbergh approached Zwick, who agreed to merge the two projects and come aboard as a producer.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} The Beginning or the End {{originated}} in October 1945 with actress Donna Reed, and {{her high school}} science teacher, Edward R. Tompkins, a chemist at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. According to The Hollywood Reporter issues of December 1945 and January 1946, MGM, Paramount and 20th Century-Fox were all interested in making a film about the Manhattan Project. Paramount's Hal B. Wallis was <b>already</b> <b>working</b> on his own version, titled Top Secret, but agreed to merge his project with MGM's and hand over his story and research, offering {{to serve as an}} adviser on the MGM treatment in return for a fixed fee and a percentage of the box office gross.|$|E

5|$|Tolman and Conant, {{in their}} role as the project's {{scientific}} advisers, drew {{up a list of}} candidate scientists and had them rated by scientists <b>already</b> <b>working</b> on the project. Groves then sent a personal letter to the head of their university or company asking for them to be released for essential war work. At the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Stanislaw Ulam gave one of his students, Joan Hinton, an exam early, so she could leave to do war work. A few weeks later, Ulam received a letter from Hans Bethe, inviting him to join the project. Conant personally persuaded Kistiakowsky to join the project.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{offices on}} the West Coast {{had been more}} {{directly}} involved in addressing the tide of anti-Japanese prejudice from the start, as they were geographically closer to the issue, and were <b>already</b> <b>working</b> on cases challenging the exclusion by this time. The Seattle office, assisting in Gordon Hirabayashi's lawsuit, created an unaffiliated committee to continue the work the ACLU had started, while in Los Angeles, attorney A.L. Wirin continued to represent Ernest Kinzo Wakayama but without addressing the case's constitutional questions. (Wirin would lose private clients because of his defense of Wakayama and other Japanese Americans.) However, the San Francisco branch, led by Ernest Besig, refused to discontinue its support for Fred Korematsu, whose case had been taken on prior to the June 22 directive, and attorney Wayne Collins, with Besig's full support, centered his defense on the illegality of Korematsu's exclusion.|$|E
5|$|The {{action is}} {{compressed}} and truncated, beginning in medias res with Pandarus <b>already</b> <b>working</b> for Troilus and praising his virtues to Cressida over {{those of the}} other knights they see returning from battle, but comically mistaking him for Deiphobus. The Trojan lovers are together only one night before the hostage exchange takes place. They exchange a glove and a sleeve as love tokens, but the next night Ulysses takes Troilus to Calchas' tent, significantly near Menelaus' tent. There they witness Diomedes successfully seducing Cressida after taking Troilus' sleeve from her. The young Trojan struggles with what his eyes and ears tell him, wishing not to believe it. Having previously considered abandoning the senselessness of war in favour of his role of lover and having then sought to reconcile love and knightly conduct, he is now left with war as his only role.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} {{team for}} Unreal Tournament consisted of around 16 people. Most team members {{had worked on}} Unreal, though Epic hired {{a number of new}} developers to reinforce the team. Programmer Brandon Reinhart was one such hire, joining Epic in August 1998 to help with the support of Unreal and the development of Unreal Tournament. In December 1998, Reinhart discovered an Unreal mod called UBrowser, which provided a new user interface for finding multiplayer matches. After showing it to James Schmalz, the lead designer at Digital Extremes, Schmalz decided to hire the mod's author, Jack Porter. After only a few weeks Porter was <b>already</b> <b>working</b> with the team, replacing the game's existing menu system with his new interface. Epic founder Tim Sweeney worked on improving the networking code along with Steve Polge, who also wrote the original AI code and focused on player physics and general gameplay. Erik de Neve was responsible for the LOD character rendering, and various extra optimizations.|$|E
5|$|Economists became {{interested}} in hysteresis when unemployment levels spiked with the 1979 oil shock and early 1980s recessions but {{did not return to}} the lower levels that had been considered the natural rate. Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers (1986) explained hysteresis in unemployment with insider-outsider models, which were also proposed by of Assar Lindbeck and Dennis Snower in a series of papers and then a book. Insiders, employees <b>already</b> <b>working</b> at a firm, are only concerned about their own welfare. They would rather keep their wages high than cut pay and expand employment. The unemployed, outsiders, do not have any voice in the wage bargaining process, so their interests are not represented. When unemployment increases, the number of outsiders increases as well. Even after the economy has recovered, outsiders continue to be disenfranchised from the bargaining process. The larger pool of outsiders created by periods of economic retraction can lead to persistently higher levels of unemployment. The presence of hysteresis in the labor market also raises the importance of monetary and fiscal policy. If temporary downturns in the economy can create long term increases in unemployment, stabilization policies do more than provide temporary relief; they prevent short term shocks from becoming long term increases in unemployment.|$|E
5|$|The British public {{first saw}} the Spitfire at the RAF Hendon air-display on Saturday 27 June 1936. Although {{full-scale}} production was supposed to begin immediately, there were numerous problems {{that could not be}} overcome for some time, and the first production Spitfire, K9787, did not roll off the Woolston, Southampton assembly line until mid-1938. The first and most immediate problem was that the main Supermarine factory at Woolston was <b>already</b> <b>working</b> at full capacity fulfilling orders for Walrus and Stranraer flying boats. Although outside contractors were supposed to be involved in manufacturing many important Spitfire components, especially the wings, Vickers-Armstrong (the parent company) was reluctant to see the Spitfire being manufactured by outside concerns, and was slow to release the necessary blueprints and subcomponents. As a result of the delays in getting the Spitfire into full production, the Air Ministry put forward a plan that production of the Spitfire be stopped after the initial order for 310, after which Supermarine would build Bristol Beaufighters. The managements of Supermarine and Vickers were able to convince the Air Ministry that the problems could be overcome, and further orders were placed for 200 Spitfires on 24 March 1938. The two orders covered the K, L and N prefix serial numbers.|$|E
