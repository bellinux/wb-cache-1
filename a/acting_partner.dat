2500|$|In 1900, {{although}} {{he was not a}} competent businessman, Dresser became an <b>acting</b> <b>partner</b> in his publishing business, which was renamed [...] "Haviland, Howley, and Dresser". His partners hoped Dresser's name would help spur more business, but the enterprise was not a success. Haviland left the partnership in 1903.

Determined to continue as a music publisher, Dresser established the [...] "Paul Dresser Company" [...] with money borrowed from his brother, Ed, but this venture failed as well.|$|E

40|$|The limited {{liability}} act of 1856 has placed {{the law of}} joint-stock companies in a satisfactory state, so far as regards {{the position of the}} shareholders. They can obtain a charter of incorporation by simply ^plying for it, and the liability of shareholders is limited to the amount of the shares. But if the principle I have stated is sound ? that mercantile liability for the consequences of a man 2 ̆ 7 s own actions ought to be unlimited ? it follows, that in every concern the <b>acting</b> <b>partners</b> ought to be under un{{limited liability}}. The <b>acting</b> <b>partners</b> of a joint-stock company are the directors; and yet the law does not recognise their unlimited liability. This ought to be changed...|$|R
2500|$|While Lucas was filming in London, where {{additional}} casting took place, Baker, {{performing a}} musical comedy act with his <b>acting</b> <b>partner</b> Jack Purvis, {{learned that the}} film crew {{was looking for a}} small person to fit inside a robot suit and maneuver it; Baker, who was [...] tall, was cast immediately after meeting George Lucas. He said, [...] "He saw me come in and said 'He'll do' because I was the smallest guy they'd seen up until then." [...] He initially turned down the role three times, hesitant to appear in a film where his face would not be shown and hoping to continue the success of his comedy act, which had recently started to be televised. R2-D2's recognizable beeps and squeaks were made by sound designer Ben Burtt and Lucas imitating [...] "baby noises", recording these voices as they were heard on an intercom, and creating the final mix using a synthesizer.|$|E

Nay, wait 'til I have finished, {{but it would not}} have been the same. I had never a soft side for the beaten weakling, and I'm glad I bided. Now, when you've proved {{yourself}} what Tom's son should be, this is what I offer thee. There's the mill; I'm old and done, and while there's one of the old stock forward I would not turn it over to be moiled and muddled by a limited company. Saving, starving, scheming, I built it bit by bit, and to-day there's no cotton spun in Lancashire to beat the Orb brand. There'll be plenty of good men under thee, and I'm waiting to make thee <b>acting</b> <b>partner.</b> Ay, it's old and done I'm growing, and, Ralph Lorimer, I'm telling thee what none but her ever guessed before--I would have sold my soul for a kind word from thy mother." ...|$|E

60|$|The third day's post {{brought me}} a most impertinent letter from a person with whom I was totally unacquainted. He {{described}} himself as the <b>acting</b> <b>partner</b> of our man of business--our dear, pig-headed old Gilmore--and he informed {{me that he had}} lately received, by the post, a letter addressed to him in Miss Halcombe's handwriting. On opening the envelope, he had discovered, to his astonishment, that it contained nothing but a blank sheet of note-paper. This circumstance appeared to him so suspicious (as suggesting to his restless legal mind that the letter had been tampered with) that he had at once written to Miss Halcombe, and had received no answer by return of post. In this difficulty, instead of acting like a sensible man and letting things take their proper course, his next absurd proceeding, on his own showing, was to pester me by writing to inquire if I knew anything about it. What the deuce should I know about it? Why alarm me as well as himself? I wrote back to that effect. It was one of my keenest letters. I have produced nothing with a sharper epistolary edge to it since I tendered his dismissal in writing to that extremely troublesome person, Mr. Walter Hartright.|$|E
60|$|The next {{letter was}} from the <b>acting</b> <b>partner</b> of a large {{manufacturing}} house to which I had advanced quite half the capital, in order {{to enter into a}} sympathetic communion with the cotton-spinners. The writer complained heavily of the import duty on the raw material, made some poignant allusions to the increasing competition on the continent and in America, and pretty clearly intimated that the lord of the manor of Householder ought to make himself felt by the administration in a question of so much magnitude to the nation. On this hint I spake. I sat down on the spot and wrote a long letter to my friend Lord Pledge, in which I pointed out to him the danger that threatened our political economy; that we were imitating the false theories of the Americans (the countrymen of Captain Poke), that trade was clearly never so prosperous as when it was the most successful, that success depended on effort, and effort was the most efficient when the least encumbered, and in short that as it was self-evident a man would jump farther without being in foot-irons, or strike harder without being hand-cuffed, so it was equally apparent that a merchant would make a better bargain for himself when he could have things all his own way than when his enterprise and industry were shackled by the impertinent and selfish interposition of the interests of others. In conclusion there was an eloquent description of the demoralizing consequences of smuggling, and a pungent attack on the tendencies of taxation in general. I have written and said some good things in my time, as several of my dependents have sworn to me in a way that even my natural modesty cannot repudiate; but I shall be excused for the weakness if I now add that I believe this letter to Lord Pledge contained some as clever points as anything I remember in their way; the last paragraph in particular being positively the neatest and the best turned moral I ever produced.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Controllability {{for service}} models {{is a similar}} {{criterion}} as soundness for workflow models: it establishes {{a necessary condition for}} correct behavior of a given service model. Technically, controllability is the problem to decide, for a given service, whether it can interact correctly with at least one other service. Parameters to the problem are the established correctness criterion (e. g. deadlock freedom, livelock freedom, quasi-liveness), the shape of partners (centralized <b>partners</b> versus independently <b>acting</b> <b>partners),</b> or the shape of communication (asynchronous versus synchronous). In this article, we survey and partly extend various recent results concerning the verification of controllability for Petri net based service models. Significant extensions include the study of livelock freedom as correctness criterion as well as the new results on autonomous multi-port controllability. ...|$|R
