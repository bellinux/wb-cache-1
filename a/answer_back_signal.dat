40|$|Type III Neuregulin 1 (Nrg 1) isoforms are membrane-tethered {{proteins}} {{capable of}} participating in bidirectional juxtacrine signaling. Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which can modulate {{the release of a}} rich array of neurotransmitters, are differentially targeted to presynaptic sites. We demonstrate that Type III Nrg 1 <b>back</b> <b>signaling</b> regulates the surface expression of α 7 nAChRs along axons of sensory neurons. Stimulation of Type III Nrg 1 <b>back</b> <b>signaling</b> induces an increase in axonal surface α 7 nAChRs, which results from a redistribution of preexisting intracellular pools of α 7 rather than from increased protein synthesis. We also demonstrate that Type III Nrg 1 <b>back</b> <b>signaling</b> activates a phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase signaling pathway and that activation of this pathway is required for the insertion of preexisting α 7 nAChRs into the axonal plasma membrane. These findings, in conjunction with prior results establishing that Type III Nrg 1 <b>back</b> <b>signaling</b> controls gene transcription, demonstrate that Type III Nrg 1 <b>back</b> <b>signaling</b> can regulate both short-and long-term changes in neuronal function...|$|R
