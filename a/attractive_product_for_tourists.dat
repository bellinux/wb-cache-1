40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to conduct {{a study of the}} history of the girls’ magazine Cordelia (1881 – 1942), founded in Florence by Angelo De Gubernatis. The analysis mainly focuses on the years 1881 – 1917; however, the latter period is also briefly treated. The theoretical framework consists of sociology of literature and gender history; the dissertation belongs to the field of history of publishing, which is integrated with a gender historical perspective. The methodological challenges faced when dealing with periodicals as research objects are also considered. In order to achieve bibliographic control and examine Cordelia’s contents and contributors, all issues of the magazine’s first 36 years were indexed. The study examines the commercial strategies of the magazine’s publishers, as well as the contributions of the chief editors and writers involved in the making of the magazine. Attention is drawn to the personal relationships between the individuals in these groups. As is shown, the magazine was not very successful in its first three years of publication, during the editorship of De Gubernatis. The two editors who followed, Ida Baccini and Jolanda (pseudonym for Maria Maiocchi Plattis), did succeed, however, in creating a familiar and <b>attractive</b> <b>product</b> <b>for</b> the young female public and to involve them in their magazine. Quantitative surveys of the contributors and contents have shown, for instance, that Baccini and Jolanda relied on regular contributions from relatively few writers and also published serial fiction to arouse the readers’ interest.

40|$|Introduction. Among {{the citrus}} species, C. sinensis {{has been the}} most studied given its {{importance}} in terms of production and its industrial application in juices. Some of orange juice's organoleptic and functional properties, which make it an <b>attractive</b> <b>product</b> <b>for</b> the consumer, are due to its carotenoid composition. Xanthophylls can be found in either their free form (as the carotenes are found) or in a more stable fatty acid esterified form in the case of mono and polyhydroxylated xanthophylls. Detection of adulteration of orange juices is of concern to consumers, regulatory agencies and citrus processing industries, and the study of carotenoid ester composition has been proposed to evaluate fruit products' authenticity. In this study, we report on the native (carotenoid esters and free carotenoids) carotenoid profile of orange juices of eight different varieties. Materials and methods. Monovarietal fresh orange juices were obtained from squeezing mid-season oranges (Citrus sinensis varieties: Bionda, Brasiliana, Moro, Ovale, Sanguinello, Tarocco, Valenc e and Washington) cultivated and supplied by a local producer. After the extraction of the carotenoids from the samples, the analyses were carried out by HPLC-DAD-APCI-MS. Results and discussion. The results showed that, in the juices st udied, the xanthophylls were mostly esterified (93 % of the total carotenoid mean content). The different varieties investigated showed variations in their carotenoid contents. The total carotenoid contents ranged from 2. 42 μg·g – 1 in the Washington variety to 15. 8 μg·g – 1 in the Valencia variety. Among the monoesters, the Valencia variety showed the highest violaxanthin ester amounts (61 %), the Brasiliana variety showed the highest  -cryptoxanthin ester content (86. 9 %) and the Tarocco variety had the highest luteoxanthin ester amount (75. 7 %). Moreover, in general, in the Brasiliana, Ovale, Sanguinello, Valencia and Washington varieties, the monoester contents were higher than the diesters, whereas in the Bionda, Moro and Tarocco varieties the opposite was determined. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that this analytical approach has been applied to characterising, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the whole carotenoid pattern (carotenoid esters and free carotenoids) in orange juices from the Bionda, Bras iliana, Moro, Ovale, Sanguinello, Tarocco, Valence and Washington varieties. This contribution could also be used to establish authenticity markers among orange varieties that could potentially be used to prevent adulteration. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

The demand for seafood is still growing and implies a risk of overexploitation. However, there are still underexploited resources as low-value fish, fish waste/by-products and discards, sometimes up to 40 to 50 % of the catch. These are often unmarketable due to various reasons such as for example unpleasant taste, presence of bones, size, etc. Use of these resources is still a great challenge for the sector requiring innovative technological strategies. Analyzing the composition of specific fish fractions such as skin, bones, head, viscera has shown the presence of n- 3 fatty acids in certain non-fatty fish fractions.

The challenge offered by Contextile 2016 was to collaborate with Oficina embroiderers to learn, then use traditional Guimarães embroidery, and, then exhibit the work at Residências Artistícas at Casa da Memória [House of Memory] in the Contextile 2016 triennial. 3 During a period in the late nineteenth century a desire for the creation of national identity existed and the documentation of Guimarães embroidery began to ensure it gained visibility. 4 The embroidery arose from a range of other factors including human will, sensibility, and dexterity to create a united unique style. Traditionally, rural women’s waistcoats were richly embroidered, such as one included in the University of Aberdeen Needlework Development Scheme collection. 5 Now, Guimarães embroidery is mostly used to adorn home ware <b>products</b> <b>for</b> the <b>tourist</b> market...|$|R
40|$|Hypertension is {{a common}} {{disorder}} of multifactorial origin that constitutes a major risk factor for cardiovascular events such as stroke and myocardial infarction. The subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins are <b>attractive</b> candidate gene <b>products</b> <b>for</b> susceptibility to hypertension, obesity and insulin resistance syndrome. A polymorphism (825 C/T) in exon 10 of the GNB 3 gene, encoding for the Gβ 3 subunit, has been described. The 825 T allele is associated with alternative splicing of the gene and formation of a truncated but functionally active β 3 subunit. Many studies have investigated whether carriers of the 825 T allele {{are at increased risk}} for hypertension, obesity, insulin-resistance and left ventricular hypertrophy with apparently conflicting results. The present review demonstrates that GNB 3 825 T allele is a useful genetic marker for better defining the risk profile of hypertensive patients, as it is associated with increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in longitudinal studies in Caucasians...|$|R
