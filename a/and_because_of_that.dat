The Spanish sportspaper Marca immediately linked him together with Dutch side Feyenoord. This was at first denied by Tomasson as pure speculation. The speculations, however soon turned out to be true. In July 2008, he left Villarreal on a free transfer, and returned to Feyenoord on a new three-year contract. Here he got off to a great start with four goals in three games. But unfortunately this was followed by a long time injury from the end of September until the end of January. <b>And</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> he could only play a total of 14 games for Feyenoord in 2008–09.|$|E
