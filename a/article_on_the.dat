5|$|Before Glöckner's 2003 <b>article</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{origin of}} the Magnificat, and for some authors still after that, it was {{generally}} assumed that Bach had composed his Magnificat in the quiet time of Advent 1723 for a first performance at the Christmas vespers. For that performance Bach composed four laudes, songs of praise partly in German, partly in Latin to be inserted at certain points in the E-flat major version of the Magnificat. The E-flat major version of the Magnificat including these interpolations is known as BWV 243a.|$|E
5|$|David {{follows the}} janitor to the victims' house, frees the {{children}} and finds their mother raped and killed, but the janitor ambushes him and pushes him off a balcony into a swimming pool. David nearly drowns (since he cannot swim), but the children rescue him. He then attacks the janitor from behind and strangles him to death while once more remaining uninjured. That night, he and Audrey reconcile. The following morning, he secretly shows a newspaper <b>article</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> anonymous heroic act, featuring a sketch of David in his hooded rain poncho, to his son, who recognizes the hero as his father.|$|E

In it Bean demanded that outside authorities, not those in LaSalle Parish, deal with the case, and that no incarceration of the defendants occur. Britain's The Observer also featured an <b>article</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> case on May 20.|$|E

500|$|Each of {{the early}} issues {{contained}} what Volin later described as [...] "clear and definite <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{way in which the}} Anarcho-Syndicalists conceived the constructive tasks of the Revolution to come", citing as examples [...] "a series of <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> role of <b>the</b> factory committees; <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tasks of the Soviets, and others on how to resolve <b>the</b> agrarian problem, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> new organization of production, and on exchange". It published copious <b>articles</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> general strike as well as <b>on</b> <b>the</b> French bourses du travail and syndicats. The paper shifted to daily publication for three months after the October Revolution of that same year. In a series of articles, it proclaimed the necessity of immediately abandoning the vanguardist Bolshevik dictatorship of the proletariat, and of allowing the workers freedom of association and action.|$|R

5|$|The quarks {{are held}} {{together}} by the strong interaction (or strong force), which is mediated by gluons.

The gluon is a member of the family of gauge bosons, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.|$|E
5|$|There is {{relatively}} little published on {{or in the}} Nafaanra language. The first linguistic publication to mention Nafaanra is Delafosse (1904), containing some notes on the Nafana people and a fairly extensive comparative Senufo word list, though it lacked any proper tonal marking. Rapp (1933) is an appendix to an <b>article</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Kulango language containing a German-Nafaanra (Nafana-Sprache) word list of around 100 items, gathered during a stay of four hours at Sampa. Rapp notes in passing that special {{attention was paid to}} the marking of the tones.|$|E
5|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} from Ceylon by English naturalist Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1847; soon after (1852), specimens {{were collected from}} South Carolina USA. Later, the fungus was described {{under a variety of}} names: Lentinus chrysopeplus from Cuba; Agaricus sabriusculus and Agaricus lacunosa from New York; Collybia lacunosa from Michigan; and Omphalia scabriuscula in Connecticut. As Canadian mycologists Redhead and Ginns explain in a 1980 <b>article</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> species, since its original 1847 description, C.asprata has been given 28 names, and placed in 14 different genera.|$|E

5|$|Trollope leapt {{into the}} fray {{somewhat}} belatedly, {{in the pages of}} Saint Paul's in October 1869, with an <b>article</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Formosa controversy that can be read as a defence of and an advertisement for The Vicar. He took exception to several of the arguments in The Times: young women of the 1860s, he wrote, were not unaware of the existence of prostitution; and attempting to keep them in ignorance would not conduce to virtue. Rather than promoting vice, an accurate depiction of the squalid and miserable life of a woman of the streets would arm young people to resist temptation.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} his death at Stamford Bridge, Harald's body was moved to Norway and buried at the Mary Church in Nidaros (Trondheim). About a hundred years after his burial, his body was reinterred at the Helgeseter Priory, which was {{demolished}} in the 17th century. On 25 September 2006, the 940th anniversary of Harald's death, the newspaper Aftenposten published an <b>article</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> poor state of Norway's ancient royal burial sites, including that of Harald, which is reportedly located underneath a road built across the monastery site. In a follow-up article on 26 September, the Municipality of Trondheim revealed they would be examining the possibility of exhuming the king and reinterring him in Nidaros Cathedral, currently the burial place of nine Norwegian kings, among them Magnus the Good and Magnus Haraldsson, Harald's predecessor and successor respectively. A month later {{it was reported that}} the proposal to exhume the king had been scrapped.|$|E
5|$|According to an <b>article</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Conversation {{written by}} Robert Merkel, Heartbleed {{revealed}} a massive failure of risk analysis. Merkel thinks OpenSSL gives more importance to performance than to security, which no longer makes sense in his opinion. But Merkel considers that OpenSSL {{should not be}} blamed as much as OpenSSL users, who chose to use OpenSSL, without funding better auditing and testing. Merkel explains that two aspects determine the risk that more similar bugs will cause vulnerabilities. One, the library's source code influences the risk of writing bugs with such an impact. Secondly, OpenSSL's processes affect the chances of catching bugs quickly. On the first aspect, Merkel mentions {{the use of the}} C programming language as one risk factor which favored Heartbleed's appearance, echoing Wheeler's analysis.|$|E
