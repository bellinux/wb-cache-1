5|$|Around this time, Himmler {{joined the}} Artaman League, a Völkisch youth group. There he met Rudolf Höss, who was later commandant of <b>Auschwitz</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>camp,</b> and Walther Darré, whose book, The Peasantry as the Life Source of the Nordic Race, caught Hitler's attention, leading to his later {{appointment}} as Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture. Darré was {{a firm believer}} in the superiority of the Nordic race, and his philosophy was a major influence on Himmler.|$|E

5|$|As the Allies {{prepared}} for the liberation of Europe, the mass deportations began {{at a rate of}} four trains a day from Hungary to the <b>Auschwitz</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>camp</b> in Nazi-occupied Poland, each train carrying around 3,000 people. Between 15 May and 8 July 1944, 437,402 Hungarian Jews are recorded as having been sent there on 147 trains, most gassed on arrival. The transports comprised most of the Jewish population outside Budapest, the Hungarian capital.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, Gröning {{was charged}} by German {{prosecutors}} as {{an accessory to}} murder, in 300,000 cases, for his role at the <b>Auschwitz</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>camp.</b> His trial began in April 2015, after the court had ruled that, {{at the age of}} 93, he was still fit to stand trial. The trial was held in Lüneburg, Germany. On 15 July 2015, he was found guilty of facilitating mass murder and sentenced to four years' imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, {{encouraged}} by von Verschuer, Mengele applied {{to transfer to}} the concentration camp service, where he foresaw the opportunity to undertake genetic research on human subjects. His application was accepted, and he was posted to <b>Auschwitz</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>camp.</b> He was appointed by SS-Standortarzt Eduard Wirths, chief medical officer at Auschwitz, {{to the position of}} chief physician of the Zigeunerfamilienlager (Romani family camp), located in the sub-camp at Birkenau.|$|E
50|$|He went on {{to become}} a member of the Russian Duma in 1906 and the Sejm from 1919 until 1935. During World War II, he was a {{prisoner}} of Nazi Germany, and was interred at both the Buchenwald and <b>Auschwitz</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>camps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Edvardson {{was born}} in Munich, Germany, in 1929. She was raised Catholic.

5|$|The first prisoners (30 German {{criminal}} prisoners {{from the}} Sachsenhausen concentration camp) arrived in May 1940, intended {{to act as}} functionaries within the prison system. The first mass transport to <b>Auschwitz</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>camp,</b> which included Catholic prisoners, suspected members of the resistance, and 20 Jews, arrived from the prison in Tarnów, Poland, on 14 June 1940. They were interned in the former building of the Polish Tobacco Monopoly, adjacent to the site, until the camp was ready.|$|E

5|$|On 3 September 1944, {{the group}} was {{deported}} on {{what would be the}} last transport from Westerbork to the <b>Auschwitz</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>camp</b> and arrived after a three-day journey. On the same train was Bloeme Evers-Emden, an Amsterdam native who had befriended Margot and Anne in the Jewish Lyceum in 1941. Bloeme saw Anne, Margot, and their mother regularly in Auschwitz, and was interviewed for her remembrances of the Frank women in Auschwitz in the television documentary The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank (1988) by Dutch filmmaker Willy Lindwer and the BBC documentary Anne Frank Remembered (1995).|$|E
5|$|Rudolf Vrba (11 September 1924– 27 March 2006) was a Slovak-Jewish {{biochemist}} who, as {{a teenager}} in 1942, was deported to the <b>Auschwitz</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>camp</b> in German-occupied Poland. He became known for having escaped from the camp in April 1944, {{at the height of the}} Holocaust, and for co-writing a detailed report about the mass murder that was taking place there. Distribution of the report is credited with having halted the mass deportation of Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz in July 1944, saving over 200,000 lives. After the war Vrba became a noted biochemist in England and Canada.|$|E
5|$|In Greece, the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS {{encountered}} {{resistance from}} the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and Greek Army. The fighting was intensified by the mountainous terrain, with its heavily defended narrow passes. The LSSAH was {{at the forefront of}} the German push. The BEF evacuated by sea to Crete, but had to flee again in late May when the Germans arrived. Like Yugoslavia, the conquest of Greece brought its Jews into danger, as the Nazis immediately took a variety of measures against them. Initially confined in ghettos, most were transported to <b>Auschwitz</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>camp</b> in March 1943, where they were killed in the gas chambers on arrival. Of Greece's 80,000 Jews, only 20 percent survived the war.|$|E
50|$|The term Lagerführer was {{distinct}} and {{separate from the}} position of Kommandant. Lagerführers were typically employed in camp complexes, where a main camp would be divided into one or more smaller camps. The most recognizable example of this was the Auschwitz command and control system, in which a single Kommandant oversaw the activities of three subordinate Lagerführers, each in charge of one of three main <b>Auschwitz</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>camps.</b>|$|R

5|$|Oskar Gröning (sometimes transliterated as Oscar Groening in English; born 10 June 1921) is a German former SS junior squad {{leader who}} was {{stationed}} at <b>Auschwitz</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>camp.</b> His responsibilities included counting and sorting the money taken from prisoners, {{and he was}} in charge of the personal property prisoners had arrived with. On a few occasions he witnessed the procedures of mass-killing in the camp. After being transferred from Auschwitz to a combat unit in October 1944, Gröning was captured by the British on 10 June 1945 when his unit surrendered. He was eventually transferred to Britain as a prisoner of war and worked as a forced labourer.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 1943, in {{addition}} to his duties at Płaszów, Göth was the officer in charge of the liquidation of the ghetto at Tarnów, which had been home to 25,000 Jews (about 45 per cent of the city's population) at the start of World War II. By the time the ghetto was liquidated, 8,000 Jews remained. They were loaded on a train to <b>Auschwitz</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>camp,</b> but less than half survived the journey. Most of the survivors were deemed unsuitable for forced labour and were murdered immediately on their arrival at Auschwitz. According to testimony of several witnesses as recorded in his 1946 indictment for war crimes, Göth personally shot between 30 and 90 women and children during the liquidation of the ghetto.|$|E
5|$|Josef Mengele was {{a medical}} officer {{assigned}} to <b>Auschwitz</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>camp</b> from 1943 {{until the end}} of the war. As well as making most of the selections of inmates as they arrived by train from all over Europe, he performed unscientific and usually deadly experiments on the inmates. He left the camp in January 1945 as the Red Army approached and was briefly in American custody in Weiden in der Oberpfalz, but was released. He took work as a farm hand in rural Germany, remaining until 1949, when he decided to flee the country; he acquired a Red Cross passport and left for Argentina; he set up a business in Buenos Aires in 1951. Acting on information received from Wiesenthal, West German authorities tried to extradite Mengele in 1960, but he could not be found; he had in fact moved to Paraguay in 1958. He moved to Brazil in 1961 and lived there until his death in 1979.|$|E

5|$|Somewhere {{around the}} time of the failed {{offensive}} against Moscow in December 1941, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately. Plans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe—eleven million people—were formalised at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942. Some would be worked to death and the rest would be killed in the implementation of Die Endlösung der Judenfrage (the Final Solution of the Jewish question). Initially the victims were killed with gas vans or by Einsatzgruppen firing squads, but these methods proved impracticable for an operation of this scale. By 1941, killing centres at <b>Auschwitz</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>camp,</b> Sobibor, Treblinka and other Nazi extermination camps replaced Einsatzgruppen as the primary method of mass killing. The total number of Jews murdered during the war is estimated at 5.5 to six million people, including over a million children. Twelve million people were put into forced labour.|$|E
5|$|Inmates were {{at times}} able to {{distribute}} {{information from the}} camp {{to the outside world}} via messages used in shortwave radio transmissions. The Polish government-in-exile in London first reported the gassing of prisoners on 21 July 1942. However, these reports were for a long time disregarded as exaggerated or unreliable by the Allied Powers, Germany's opponents in the West. Information regarding Auschwitz was also available to the Allies during the years 1940–43 by the accurate and frequent reports of Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa) Captain Witold Pilecki. Pilecki was the only known person to volunteer to be imprisoned at <b>Auschwitz</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>camp,</b> spending 945 days there. He gathered evidence of genocide and organized resistance structures known as Związek Organizacji Wojskowej (ZOW) at the camp. His first report was smuggled to the outside world in November 1940, through an inmate who was released from the camp. He eventually escaped on 27 April 1943, but his personal report of mass killings was dismissed as exaggeration by the Allies, as were his previous reports.|$|E
