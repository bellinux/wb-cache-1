5000|$|In {{the near}} future, a Japanese {{scientist}} creates a powerful high-tech exoskeleton called [...] "Infinite Stratos" [...] (IS). Possessing technology and combat capabilities far surpassing {{that of any}} other arms system, the IS threatens to destabilize the world. Faced with such an overpowered weapon, the world's nations enact the [...] "Alaska Treaty", stating that IS shall never be used for military combat purposes, and that the existing IS technology must be equally distributed to all nations, to prevent any one nation from dominating the others. However, sometime <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>IS</b> was introduced, the society undergone a drastic change. As IS can only be operated by women, there is a shift in the power balance between men and women, where women now dominate society over men.|$|E
50|$|Ten years <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>IS</b> was {{initially}} introduced, {{the world has}} entered a new age of peace. However, a 15-year old male Japanese teenager named Ichika Orimura changes everything. During an accidental run-in with a hibernating IS suit, it is revealed that he possesses the innate ability to operate an IS - the only male in the world capable of doing so. Seeing his potential, the Japanese government forcibly enrolls the bewildered young man to attend the prestigious Infinite Stratos Academy, a multicultural academy where IS pilots {{from all over the}} world are trained. Thus, he starts a busy high school life surrounded by girls training to become expert IS pilots. While they seem to be enjoying their thrilling school life, the danger of looming threats and enemies is never too far away.|$|E

In this paper, we examine the current IS curricula of over 130 AACSB-accredited business programs to determine how closely they are modeled <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>IS</b> 2002 Model Curriculum.

40|$|We {{develop and}} {{evaluate}} receiver algorithms {{for the detection}} of signals transmitted via the downlink of a cellular system modeled <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>IS</b> 95 standard for code-division multiple-access (CDMA) communications. Multiuser detectors on board airborne and terrestrial mobile signal monitors attempt the simultaneous detection, in a single receiver, of all communication signals transmitted by the base station of interest. Due to the detrimental effects of transmitter, receiver and channel nonlinearities, very fast multipath fading, Doppler spread, additive white Gaussian noise, and intercell multiple-access interference, the user signals are de-orthogonalized. This leads to performance degradation in conventional receivers that is too severe, especially when the powers of some of the interfering users are dominant. In order to improve upon the performance of conventional matched filter receivers, this article focuses on the development and evaluation of relatively simple successive interfer [...] ...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} importance of studies that link sex to stress coping processes. Re-cently, we reported that male and female Wistar rats responded differently to prenatal stress (PS) under basal conditions. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the influence of sex on be-haviour and coping strategies, as an effect of gestational adversity in rats that were exposed to an uncontrollable stressor. Once the animals reached adulthood, the offspring from stressed/non-stressed dams were subjected or not to antidepressant treatment with Sertraline. After that, they were exposed to a single inescapable shock (IS) session, in which the rats were further tested for escape behaviour along 10 days, as a model of learned helplessness (LH). In prenatally stressed animals <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>IS,</b> behavioural differences appeared in a sex specific manner. Males proved to b...|$|E
40|$|Whereas {{the most}} {{vulnerable}} and error-prone part of the development cycle is the requirements elicitation and analysis stage, the methods offered in this area {{have been criticized for}} either being too soft for engineering an IS, or too hard, neglecting social, organizational, human and other non-technical aspects of the IS’s environment. A holistic approach is necessary to combine the advantages of both approaches. The paper’s proposal is to enrich and validate the IS requirements produced by any structured/’hard ’ IS development methodology by means of examining the IS’s business context with a view to ensure the compliance of the IS characteristics with its business environment. To this end, the business state model is proposed, which is a collaborative work for constructing a common view both of the organization’s current state and the desired outcome <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>IS</b> introduction, by synthesizing the personal perceptions of all involved parties. The proposed model is not a method as such. It provides the rational and the philosophy for holistic requirements and, thus, {{can be used as a}} conceptual model for eliciting and analyzing IS requirements. 1...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{companies}} face continuous changes. Every {{change a}} firm face {{has to be}} carefully addressed by everyone in the organization but especially by leaders and the managerial team. However these changes not always produce monetary benefits. A change on the IS might increase productivity in one business area but it might not represent profit to the whole company. There are several change studies {{which can be used}} as guide by leaders when im-plementing a change. However none of these theories consider the possibility to improve efficiency {{as a result of the}} change. Neither to assure that <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>IS</b> change implementation the company‟s profitability increases. The theory of con-straints (TOC) is a useful tool which covers both of the issues mentioned before. This paper will combine several change theories with the theory of constraints. With this mixture of ideas we want to show leaders a new procedure on which they can relay on when dealing with the process of an IS change. This procedure should assure an increment on the productivity produce after the change. But also consider an addition to the company profitability. We studied three change related theories. We then revised the TOC and we com-pared all this recollected information with the way six leaders handled IS changes in their companies. These five companies were Dell, Cisco Systems, Desca, Ericsson, and Nortel. At the end we were able to identify critical success factors which any leader should consider when facing an IS change. These factors cover from the beginning of the IS change, the implementation of it and finally the way to make this change maximize the business performance...|$|E
40|$|Information systems (IS) {{are widely}} {{acknowledged}} to be central for contemporary organizations. Along {{with the increasing}} importance of new IS in organizations, a school of thought has developed {{over the last few}} years that claims that IS and organizations mutually shape each other. While new IS shape organizational structure and behavior, the actual role and importance of IS in organizations is largely dependent on the organizational setting. However, questions of how IS and organizations mutually shape each other have remained largely unexplored.    The purpose of this thesis is to create better understanding of the design and use of IS in an organizational context. Actor-network theory (ANT) is used as a theoretical perspective to gain an understanding of how IS and organization influence each other. An interpretive case study approach was used for data collection. The case study was conducted in the municipal organization of Umeå, Sweden, over a period 36 months that covered the design process and use of a new IS. Semi-structured interviews, participant observations and document analysis were used as data collection techniques.    The findings indicate that the municipal organization became intertwined with technology by mobilizing a significant amount of allies in the IS adaption process. It was also found that the character of the IS in the organization was multi-faceted, and there were different versions of the application available for different actors. A new organizational behavior was established as a result of the design and use of the IS. While the new IS contributed to making more available the complicated financial aspects of the municipality, it also contributed in reinforcing a certain view on decision-making that was focused on organizational resources rather than on organizational objectives. The organizational changes that took place were of a constant nature, and there was no closure of the change processes as new issues continuously surfaced that needed attention.    The concept of evolving multi-purpose networks is coined to describe and analyze the character of the technology dependent organization. The concept of negotiation loop is coined to describe and analyze the processes of IS adaption, where the role and meaning of the IS changes as new actors are enrolled to the network. An evolving multipurpose network is changeful as negotiation loops continue <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>IS</b> is established in the organization. The notation of evolving multipurpose networks is meant to stimulate reflection both for researchers and practitioners, underscoring the negotiated character of IS in organizations. It is meant to allow a better understanding for how the design and use of IS in an organizational context is a process of mutual influence between the IS and organization. digitalisering@um...|$|E
