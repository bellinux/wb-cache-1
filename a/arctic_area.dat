5|$|Z38 was a Type 1936A (Mob) {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Kriegsmarine during World War II. She was laid down in 1941, and completed two years later. Her anti-aircraft armament was modified heavily under Project Barbara. She served with the 4th Destroyer Flotilla her entire time under German service, and {{spent much of her}} life escorting escorting task forces, patrolling areas of sea, laying mines, or bombarding land forces. She served in the Baltic briefly in 1943, before being reassigned to the <b>Arctic</b> <b>area</b> around Norway from 1943 to 1945, and then serving in the Baltic again in 1945.|$|E
25|$|The Arctic is {{comparatively}} clean, {{although there}} are certain ecologically difficult localized pollution problems that present {{a serious threat to}} people's health living around these pollution sources. Due to the prevailing worldwide sea and air currents, the <b>Arctic</b> <b>area</b> is the fallout region for long-range transport pollutants, and in some places the concentrations exceed the levels of densely populated urban areas. An example of this is the phenomenon of Arctic haze, which is commonly blamed on long-range pollutants. Another example is with the bioaccumulation of PCB's (polychlorinated biphenyls) in Arctic wildlife and people.|$|E

25|$|The North Slope {{is mostly}} tundra {{peppered}} with small villages. The area {{is known for}} its massive reserves of crude oil, and contains both the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska and the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field. Barrow, the northernmost city in the United States, is located here. The Northwest <b>Arctic</b> <b>area,</b> anchored by Kotzebue and also containing the Kobuk River valley, is often regarded as being part of this region. However, the respective Inupiat of the North Slope and of the Northwest Arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people.|$|E

60|$|The {{observations}} {{which have}} been detailed leave {{no doubt that the}} Antarctic sea bottom, from a little to the south of the fiftieth parallel, as far as 80° S., is being covered by a fine deposit of silicious mud, more or less mixed, in some parts, with the ice-borne débris of polar lands and with the ejections of volcanoes. The silicious particles which constitute this mud, are derived, in part, from the diatomaceous plants and radiolarian animals which throng the surface, and, in part, from the spicula of sponges which live at the bottom. The evidence respecting the corresponding <b>Arctic</b> <b>area</b> is less complete, but it is sufficient to justify the conclusion that an essentially similar silicious cap is being formed around the northern pole.|$|E

40|$|With {{oil and gas}} {{production}} reaching its tail end on many fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, the industry is looking towards the Arctic to start exploration and production. It is estimated that 14 % of the worlds remaining oil and natural gas reserves are found in <b>Arctic</b> <b>areas,</b> most of these offshore. The harsh Arctic conditions concerning climate, lack of infrastructure and long distances generate challenges in respect to keeping risk low and regularity high on oil and gas producing installations in this area. The research presented in this thesis highlights the challenges concerning operation and maintenance of offshore production installations in <b>Arctic</b> <b>areas.</b> Challenges to Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Supportability (RAMS) in <b>Arctic</b> <b>areas</b> are identified. The case study conducted as a part of this study indicates that maintenance will be essential in keeping regularity high on an offshore oil and {{gas production}} facility in the Arctic. Harsh operating conditions can cause increases in failure frequencies, failure modes and failure mechanisms resulting in a need for different and more frequent preventive maintenance. Many maintenance tasks and corrective repairs can be expected to be more time consuming in the Arctic than in temperate areas. Furthermore, the economic model gives an overview of the increase in man-hours and costs when the activities are planned to be conducted in <b>arctic</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
