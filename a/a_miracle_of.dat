When they came to the nearby stream of Kusha to take the horses across, it {{appeared}} to them like an enormous river. They moved away from it in fear, but when they looked back from a distance, the stream appeared small. As they approached it again, the Kusha again became huge and impassable. After several such attempts to cross the stream, the thieves realized that this was <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> <b>of</b> the saint, so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.|$|E
5|$|Following {{two decades}} of uneasy peace, Britain and France {{declared}} war against one another in 1689. Despite the 1669 Treaty of Whitehall, in which European forces agreed that Continental conflicts would not disrupt colonial peace and neutrality, the war was fought primarily by proxy in New France and New England. The British of New York prompted local Iroquois warriors to attack New France's undefended settlements. While the British were preparing to engage in acts of warfare, the inhabitants of New France were ill-prepared to defend against the Indian attacks” due to {{the isolation of the}} farms and villages. Denonville was quoted as saying “If we have a war, nothing can save the country but <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> <b>of</b> God,”.|$|E

25|$|The {{ending of}} the Chronicle of Hydatius, in 469, marks the {{beginning}} of a period of obscurity {{in the history of the}} Sueves, who don’t re-emerge into historical light until the mid-sixth century, when we have plenty of sources. Among these, the most notable are the works of the Pannonian Martin of Braga, sometimes called the apostle of the Sueves, as well as the accounts of Gregory of Tours. In the Miracles of Saint Martin, Gregory narrated, and attributed to <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> <b>of</b> Saint Martin of Tours, the conversion of king Chararic to Catholicism, while in the History of the Franks he dedicated several chapters to the relations of Sueves, Visigoths and Franks, and to the end of the independence of the Suevi, annexed by the Visigoths in 585. On the other hand, Martin of Braga, a monk who arrived in Galicia circa 550, became a true transformative power: as founder of monasteries and as bishop and abbot of Dume he promoted the conversion of the Sueves, and later as archbishop of Braga and maximum religious authority of the kingdom he participated in the reformation of the Church and of the local administration. Several of his works have been preserved, among them a Formula for an Honest life dedicated to King Miro; a treatise against the superstitions of the country inhabitants; and several other minor treatises. He was also present in the Councils of Braga, with the deliberations of the second one being led by him, as archbishop of the capital, Braga. The acts of these Councils, together with the Divisio Theodemiri, are the most precious sources on the inner political and religious life of the kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Kent's {{career began}} as a sign and coach painter who was {{encouraged}} to study art, design and architecture by his employer. A group of Yorkshire gentlemen sent Kent {{for a period of}} study in Rome, and he set sail on 22 July 1709 from Deal, Kent, arriving at Livorno on 15 October. By 18 November he was in Florence, staying there until April 1710 before finally setting off for Rome. In 1713 he was awarded the second medal in the second class for painting in the annual competition run by the Accademia di San Luca for his painting of <b>A</b> <b>Miracle</b> <b>of</b> S. Andrea Avellino. He also met several important figures including Thomas Coke, later 1st Earl of Leicester, with whom he toured Northern Italy in the summer of 1714 (a tour that led Kent to an appreciation of the architectural style of Andrea Palladio's palaces in Vicenza), and Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni in Rome, for whom he apparently painted some pictures, though no records survive. During his stay in Rome, he painted the ceiling of the church of San Giuliano dei Fiamminghi (Church of St. Julian of the Flemings) with the Apotheosis of St. Julian. The most significant meeting was between Kent and Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington. Kent left Rome for the last time in the autumn of 1719, met Lord Burlington briefly at Genoa, Kent journeying on to Paris, where Lord Burlington later joined him for the final journey back to England {{before the end of the}} year. As a painter, he displaced Sir James Thornhill in decorating the new staterooms at Kensington Palace, London; for Burlington, he helped to decorate Chiswick House, especially the painted ceilings, and Burlington House.|$|E

The design and production, Porter reported, were [...] "brilliant", while Mackerras commanded his disparate forces masterfully. Several critics remarked favourably on {{the sound of the}} handbells. The Timess critic noted the effectiveness of Britten's setting of the mystery play: [...] "It is Britten's triumph that in this musically slender piece he has brought to new life the mentality of another century by wholly modern means.

[...] In The Times H C Colles said that the LPO was [...] "as fine an instrument as could be wished for"; Neville Cardus wrote in The Manchester Guardian, [...] "nothing more sumptuous and daring in orchestral playing could be heard in more than three other cities between New York and Vienna"; and W J Turner, of The Illustrated London News, praised {{the orchestra}}'s [...] "youthful dash and virtuosity... at last we have an independent orchestra which rivals the BBC Symphony Orchestra".|$|E

A later Guardian critic, Peter Bradshaw, named it the best comedy film of all time, commenting that [...] "this wonderfully funny, unbearably sad film is <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> <b>of</b> comic writing and inspired film-making". John Marriott of the Radio Times believed that Annie Hall was the film where Allen [...] "found his own singular voice, a voice that echoes across events with a mixture of exuberance and introspection", referring to the [...] "comic delight" [...] derived from the [...] "spirited playing of Diane Keaton as the kooky innocent from the Midwest, and Woody himself as the fumbling New York neurotic". Empire magazine rated the movie five out of five stars, calling it a [...] "classic". At Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 65 reviews, with an average rating of 8.9 out of 10. The site's consensus reads [...] "Filled with poignant performances and devastating humor, Annie Hall represents a quantum leap for Woody Allen and remains an American classic".|$|E

2500|$|In some legends, samekh {{is said to}} {{have been}} <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> <b>of</b> the Ten Commandments. [...] records that the tablets [...] "were written on both their sides."

The Babylonian Talmud (tractate Shabbat 104a), on the other hand, attributes this instead to samekh, but samekh did not have such a hollow form in the sacred Paleo-Hebrew alphabet that would presumably have been used for the tablets.
