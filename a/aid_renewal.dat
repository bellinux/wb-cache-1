40|$|Grant {{support has}} been well used by the University of Florida as host {{institution}} to support various educational institutions {{in the use of}} the reactor and associated facilities as indicated in the proposal. These various educational institutions are located primarily within Florida. However, when the 600 -mile distance from Pensacola to Miami is considered, it is obvious that this Grant provides access to reactor utilization for a broad geographical region and a diverse set of user institutions serving over twelve million inhabitants throughout the State of Florida and still others throughout the nation. All users and uses were carefully screened to assure the usage was for educational institutions eligible for participation in the Reactor Sharing Program; where research activities were involved, care was taken to assure the research activities were not funded by grants for contract funding from outside sources. In some cases external grant funding is limited or is used up, in which case the Reactor Sharing Grant and frequent cost sharing by the UFTR facility and the University of Florida provide the necessary support to complete a project or to provide more results to make a complete project even better. In some cases this latter usage has <b>aided</b> <b>renewal</b> of external funding. The role of the Reactor Sharing Program, though relatively small in dollars, has been the single most important occurrence in assuring the rebirth and continued high utilization of the UFTR in a time when many better equipped and better placed facilities have ceased operations. Through dedicated and effective advertising efforts, the UFTR has seen nearly every four-year college and university in Florida make substantive use of the facility under the Reactor Sharing Program with many now regular users. Some have even been able to support usage from outside grants where the Reactor Sharing Grant has served as seed money; still others have been assisted when external grants were depleted...|$|R

40|$|Phase diagram {{based on}} the mean square {{displacement}} (MSD) {{and the distribution of}} diffusion coefficients of the time-averaged MSD for the stored-energy-driven Lévy flight (SEDLF) is presented. In the SEDLF, a random walker cannot move while storing energy, and it jumps by the stored energy. The SEDLF shows a whole spectrum of anomalous diffusions including subdiffusion and superdiffusion, depending on the coupling parameter between storing time (trapping time) and stored energy. This stochastic process can be investigated analytically with the <b>aid</b> of <b>renewal</b> theory. Here, we consider two different renewal processes, i. e., ordinary renewal process and equilibrium renewal process, when the mean trapping time does not diverge. We analytically show the phase diagram according to the coupling parameter and the power exponent in the trapping-time distribution. In particular, we find that distributional behavior of time-averaged MSD intrinsically appears in superdiffusive as well as normal diffusive regime even when the mean trapping time does not diverge.

40|$|Over {{the second}} half of the 20 th Century and the {{beginning}} part of the 21 st Century, major change has occurred in the worship practice of many churches. Within this time frame enormous change has occurred in the social, economic, political, technological, scientific and religious framework of British society. Worship practice has been influenced by these changes. This doctoral dissertation sets out to explore how British Methodist worship has changed over the same time period. The focus of this dissertation is on change in the practice of non-Eucharistic worship in British Methodism. This is the form of worship practiced most frequently in the British Methodist Church. It examines the form, content, style and ordering of worship and explores how the very ethos of worship has altered. In this time period there has been expressed discontent about worship. This thesis examines what the Liturgical Movement has promoted as a way toward renewal of worship, and explores how British Methodism might appropriate from the Liturgical Movement ideas and lessons that would <b>aid</b> the <b>renewal</b> of worship in the Methodist Church. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{the time}} of war and {{military}} occupation, {{it is possible for}} planning to articulate an ethics of disavowal and refusal. However, when empire involves much more than war, when empire also involves reconstruction, <b>renewal,</b> <b>aid,</b> and democracy, then it is much more difficult for planning to opt out of this liberal moral order. Situated at the heart of empire, that is, in America, this article explores some of these dilemmas of praxis and thereby the limits of liberalism. Drawing upon Marxist theory, cultural studies, and postcolonial critique, it makes a case for an ethics of ‘doubleness’, one where benevolence can be recognized as Othering but also where complicity can be transformed into subversion...|$|R

Creswin drew up a second proposal, where the same 30,000-40,000-seat stadium would be built instead in south Point Douglas. This new plan, they said, would greatly <b>aid</b> in urban <b>renewal</b> in what is the poorest neighborhood in Winnipeg. There was also a state-of-the-art water park & hotel, commercial buildings, and several other new buildings in the multimillion-dollar proposal. However, there was controversy here as well since south Point Douglas is an avid art community; many of the residents didn't want their character buildings to be destroyed, or suffer the loss of their homes.A letter of intent was signed on September 13, 2009 between Asper's Creswin Properties and the University of Manitoba, allowing planning to continue for a stadium at the intersection of Chancellor Matheson Drive and University Crescent. The site is adjacent to the current University Stadium, which was built for the 1967 Pan American Games. The new proposal includes the construction of a 33,422-seat stadium, renovation of the existing stadium, and a world-class fitness facility. Inflatable 'bubbles' covering the playing field will also be made available in both stadiums during the winter months. The cost of the new stadium, was projected to be $115 million.|$|R
40|$|Many {{people who}} receive exposure-based {{treatments}} for anxiety disorders exhibit {{a return of}} fear and avoidance which {{is often referred to}} as renewal or relapse. Human and nonhuman research on fear conditioning and renewal has been instrumental in helping understand relapse in anxiety disorders. The purpose of this investigation was to examine renewal of human avoidance and assess whether avoidance may <b>aid</b> in sustaining <b>renewal</b> of fear responses. We adopted a multimodal measurement approach consisting of an approach-avoidance task along with ratings of perceived threat and fear and measures of skin-conductance, a widely used physiological measure of fear. A traditional, single-subject research design was used with six healthy adults. All tasks employed a discrete trial procedure. Experimental conditions included Pavlovian fear conditioning in which increased probability of money loss was paired with a “threat” meter in Context A and later followed extinction in Context B. Fear and avoidance increased to higher threat levels in Context A but not Context B. Renewal testing involved presenting the threat meter on a return to Context A to determine if it evoked fear and avoidance (i. e., relapse). As predicted, renewal testing in Context A showed that increased threat was associated with increased avoidance, ratings of perceived threat and fear, and higher skin-conductance. Moreover, results showed that renewal maintained over six blocks of trials. This is the first investigation of renewal of threat and avoidance in humans that highlights avoidance as a mechanism that may contribute to maintaining fear in anxiety pathology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Commercialization of {{products}} {{is an essential}} process for a firm {{in the course of}} value delivery. It is sometimes seen as a yardstick used in measuring the performance of the firm in the market as well as the revenue generating capacity of a firm. Premised on this, it is pertinent to ask how a successful commercialization strategy is being planned and executed by a firm. So, this research is hinged on the role of business model (innovation) in the commercialization strategies in SMEs. The present study is then focused on how business model innovation contributes to the successful commercialization {{of products}} in SMEs and for this reason, a framework is introduced that explains the roles of open innovation, the business environment and product reconfiguration as inherent in the path to success in the market by SMEs. Hence, the framework is further anchored on the use of both inflows and outflows of knowledge or technologies by SMEs in product reconfiguration with the basic aim of commercialization of same successfully in the market. It should be borne in mind that a business model describes the rational a firm will use to make revenue in the process of value delivery and when the business model seems to be ineffective, a replacement comes in. In this wise, business model innovation is the replacement of an existing business model of a firm. Business model innovation will consequently evolve the means of product reconfiguration for a firm in the attempt to re-create and re-deliver value to its customers. It follows therefore that business model innovation will <b>aid</b> the <b>renewal</b> of an existing product through reconfiguration in order to re-create, re-capture and re-deliver value in the market. In this line, the commercialization of products in the open market requires business model innovation to succeed. The open innovation environment therefore serves as the harbinger through which the innovation of a business model may take place by availing the firm the opportunity to collaborate and share ideas or technologies with others as opposed to the closed innovation attempt. This study, which is done empirically, aims at contributing theoretically and managerially to helping firms understand the nature of their business model and recognize lapses inherent therein for renewal. More so, it will also serve as an avenue for managers to be more equipped in understanding their existing business model and to detect and benefit from the use of new and incipient technologies. The study has been carried out based on the use of empirical data collected from two case companies in Finland and Nigeria thereby producing a reliable result on the role of business model innovation in the commercialization strategies in SMEs and also demonstrating the importance of business model innovation in the internationalization exertion of SMEs...|$|R
40|$|This fictionalized {{history is}} the {{screenplay}} for a feature length motion picture. The setting for the story is St. Cecilia Parish in Detroit, the year prior to and {{the week of the}} riot of 1967. Fr. Ray Ellis has been appointed pastor to succeed Monsignor Hebert, an old man overcome by the social and religious changes of the 1960 's. The new pastor initiates a liturgical <b>renewal,</b> <b>aided</b> by Morgan Grant, and a community revitalization sparked by his own warmth and sensitivity. Conservatives, led by J. B. Fisher, discontinue their contributions. The ensuing financial crisis causes the parish to close its high school, generating both black and white displeasure. Within the community, a black Muslim leader, Malachi X, brands Ellis as a zealous white missionary come to save the heathen blacks. He himself preaches a volatile brand of social revolution. Over the objections of his bishop, Ellis covers the ceiling of the church with a mural of a black Christ and heroes of the American black movement, such as Malcolm X. He strives to provide black ownership of the businesses of the community, but in this he is greatly hampered by Fisher. Criticism grows and the bishop advises that he resign. He has this on his mind when the riot breaks out. Ellis becomes involved in a protective look-out operation from the church tower. Suspected of being a sniper, he becomes the target in a police shooting gallery, and in the melee Grant is arrested. Fisher charges that the priest's presence in the community has been inflammatory to riot. Uncertain of himself, Ellis tours the area, torn by days of burning and looting. The situation is discouraging, and Ellis has to draw upon the full measure of his Faith, in God and in his fellowman. He writes a letter of resignation, but conditions it upon the appointment of a black priest to replace him. Until that happens, he pledges to his people his continued service as their pastor...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{role and}} {{function}} of downtowns have changed over time. Traditionally, downtowns were {{the social and economic}} hubs of a city. Downtown decline has been attributed to many interrelated factors including the construction of suburban areas, increased automobile use, and suburban shopping malls. Since the 1950 s, several strategies have been used in North American cities in order to try and reverse downtown decline. Hamilton, Ontario, like many other North American mid-size cities, has attempted several revitalization projects in an attempt to renew the core. The purpose of this research is {{to gain a better understanding}} of factors that have historically prevented the successful revitalization of a downtown area within a mid-size city. This is explored through a case study of Hamilton, Ontario from the time period of 1955 to 2005. To address this question, a qualitative approach was used. This involved a literature review, the use of archival data, and key expert interviews on revitalization in downtown Hamilton. Firstly, this study identifies and reviews the history and trends of urban renewal in downtown Hamilton. Secondly, this study reviews whether there has been a gap between planning proposals and their implementation and if a gap exists, if it can be bridged. During the second half of the 20 th century the character of downtown Hamilton was influenced by a series of plans and proposals aimed at core area renewal. The findings of this study indicate that large scale projects to demolish and rebuild tracts of the downtown, compete with suburban areas, or accommodate the automobile rather than pedestrians were not successful in the long-term at revitalizing the core area. Efforts that <b>aided</b> in downtown <b>renewal</b> included: public-private partnerships, private development, brownfield development, and creating a framework for future plans and renewal efforts through the Downtown Secondary Plan. Previous efforts failed because they relied too heavily on government funding, they were too large scale, they did not involve true public participation, and there was no solid framework backing the planning process. This research also indicates that there is a gap between planning proposals and their implementation and that there is room for this gap to be narrowed. The conclusion that this gap cannot be bridged is clear, however, working towards narrowing this gap is important. Narrowing this gap would involve a less reactionary approach to planning and continuing with small scale incremental changes that build confidence in the downtown area and encourage a sense of place. These initiatives should be part of a larger vision and should continue to include public participation...|$|R
