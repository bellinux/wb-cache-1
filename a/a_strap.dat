5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) {{defended the}} NWA World Tag Team Championship against Team Canada (Eric Young and Petey Williams), who were {{accompanied}} by A-1, in a Six Sides of Steel Strap match next. It lasted 14 minutes even. In <b>a</b> <b>strap</b> match, wrestlers are attached by <b>a</b> <b>strap</b> {{for the duration of}} the match, but they mainly used it as a weapon. AMW retained the titles after forcing Williams into the mat by performing their signature maneuver, the Death Sentence.|$|E
5|$|Robert Roode, who was {{accompanied}} by Payton Banks, fought Booker T, who {{was accompanied}} by Traci Brooks, in a Stand By Your Man Strap match. The duration of the contest was seven minutes and fifty-six seconds. In a Stand By Your Man Strap match, both competitors are connected with a ten-foot-long strap, with the match won by either pinfall or submission. Roode gained the pinfall after punching Booker T {{with a pair of}} handcuffs. After the match, Banks got to lash Brooks with <b>a</b> <b>strap</b> ten times, until Sharmell made her return attacking Roode and Banks with <b>a</b> <b>strap.</b>|$|E
5|$|Armigers, like clan {{chiefs and}} chieftains, may wear their own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their own motto or slogan. Armigers are permitted to wear one silver eagle feather behind the circlet (or on certain occasions a real eagle feather). If an Armiger {{is a member of}} the British Peerage or a feudal baron they are permitted to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge. If an Armiger is a member of a Scottish clan he or she may wear the crest badge of their chief, however it must be encircled by <b>a</b> <b>strap</b> and buckle (see Un-armigerous clan members below).|$|E

5|$|Crest badges {{consist of}} a crest and a motto/slogan. These {{elements}} are heraldic property and protected by law in Scotland. Crest badges may be worn by anyone; however, {{those who are not}} entitled to the heraldic elements within, wear a crest badge surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>strap</b> and buckle. Those who own the heraldic elements within, may wear a crest badge surrounded by a plain circlet. The strap and buckle represents that the wearer is a follower of the individual who owns the crest and motto.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} WWF, McIntyre {{continued}} to wrestle sporadically on the independent circuit. At that time, {{there were not}} many opportunities for females in the business. She competed in the Women's Pro Wrestling organization in the early 1990s. In November 1993, she won the Canadian Wrestling Alliance's Women's Championship from Iron Maiden, but lost it to Iron Maiden again in January 1994. They continued to feud into 1996, when the two women joined Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling, where the two traded the Women's Championship, which McIntyre held for two months. In September, they competed in <b>a</b> <b>strap</b> match—a match where the wrestlers must compete while connected via a leather strap—in which McIntyre was victorious.|$|E
5|$|At Destination X, Robert Roode fought Booker T in a Stand By Your Man Strap match. Cornette {{announced}} on the February 14 episode of Impact!, that Booker T and Roode would {{face in a}}nother match at Destination X. On the March 6, 2008, episode of Impact!, Cornette announced that Booker T and Roode would face in a Stand By Your Man Strap match, in which if Booker T won then Traci Brooks {{would be allowed to}} beat Payton Banks with <b>a</b> <b>strap</b> ten times and vice versa. Roode won the bout at Destination X. After the contest, Sharmell returned from injury attacking Roode and Banks. This resulted in an Intergender Tag Team Six Sides of Steel Cage match at TNA's Lockdown PPV event on April 13, 2008 pitting Roode and Banks against Booker T and Sharmell, which the later team won.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on <b>a</b> <b>strap.</b> Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E
5|$|Robert Roode versus Booker T in a Stand By Your Man Strap {{match was}} another highly {{promoted}} match {{heading into the}} event. The feud regarding this contest began at Final Resolution, where Roode accidentally punched Booker T's wife Sharmell, fracturing her jaw in the storyline, after a Mixed Tag Team match pitting Roode and his then-manager Ms. Brooks against Booker T and Sharmell. Booker T and Roode then fought at Against All Odds to a double count-out. Cornette announced on the February 14 episode of Impact! that Booker T and Roode would face in another match at Destination X. On the February 28, 2008, episode of Impact!, Roode handcuffed Booker T to the ring ropes and beat him with a belt, until Roode's former manager Ms. Brooks, now Traci Brooks, came to Booker T's defense. However, Roode and his new manager Payton Banks ended up attacking both with belts. On the March 6 episode of Impact!, Cornette announced that Booker T and Roode would face in a Stand By Your Man Strap match, in which if Booker T won then Brooks {{would be allowed to}} beat Banks with <b>a</b> <b>strap</b> ten times and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, Sarita {{entered a}} feud with Velvet Sky, scoring back-to-back pinfall victories over {{her on the}} October 28 and the November 4 episodes of Impact!, first in a six-woman tag team match {{and then in a}} singles match. Sarita and Taylor Wilde had their third match at the November 9 tapings of Xplosion, with Sarita once again coming out victorious. Despite wrestling on the November 25 episode of Impact! as a face, when she answered the challenge of TNA Women's Knockout Champion Madison Rayne and then defeated her in a non-title match, Sarita resumed her status as a heel and her feud with Sky on the December 9 episode of Impact! when, despite losing to her and Love in the first round match of a tournament for the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship, Sarita claimed that Sky was a loser, and {{would never be able to}} beat her. On the December 23 episode of Impact!, Sky was set to wrestle for the Knockouts Tag Team Championship, but was forced to miss the match, after being attacked backstage by Sarita. The following week, Sarita defeated Sky in <b>a</b> <b>Strap</b> match. On the February 10 episode of Impact!, Sarita's on-screen cousin, Rosita, made her TNA debut in an eight-woman tag team match, where the duo teamed with Madison Rayne and Tara and defeated Angelina Love, Mickie James, Velvet Sky and Winter. The following week, Sarita and Rosita aligned themselves with Hernandez, who had returned from working in Mexico the previous week and had begun expressing anti-American views. Later in the evening, Sarita and Rosita defeated Angelina Love and Velvet Sky in a tag team match. Afterwards, Sky challenged Sarita to a one-on-one match, where she agreed to put her career on the line. On the March 3 episode of Impact!, Sky was able to defeat Sarita in a singles match, salvaging her career in the process.|$|E
