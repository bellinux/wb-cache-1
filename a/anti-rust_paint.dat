40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first results concerning tests {{carried out to}} evaluate the atmospheric corrosion in Brazilian Legal Amazon, {{as part of the}} SIVAM â€“ Amazon Surveillance System. The aim of the present work is to determine and select materials as well as <b>anti-rust</b> <b>paints,</b> which will be employed to protect metallic structures of radar towers, equipment and buildings. Five <b>anti-rust</b> <b>paints</b> on mild and galvanised steels were tested. Field tests are supported by accelerated laboratory results in wet and drying cycles in electrolytes simulating different microclimates. These solutions were prepared in laboratory based on pH, conductivity and chloride content values of locally collected rainwater...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the corrosion protection and control of reinforcing steels in concrete is reported. The reinforcing steels were coated with local coating materials (i) bitumen, (ii) enamel paint, and (iii) local <b>anti-rust</b> <b>paint.</b> The reinforced concrete samples were immersed in a 0. 05 M NaCl solution. The study reveals the protection offered by these coatings in the sodium chloride solution. The study also reveals that the coatings used on the reinforcing steels have good corrosion protection within {{the period of the}} {{experimental study}} but this cannot be guaranteed at longer periods of time. The results indicated that the enamel paint coating has the best protection against corrosion in NaCl solution, followed by the bitumen coating, and finally local <b>anti-rust</b> <b>paint</b> coating. The potentials and resistances of the coated reinforcing steels at the end of six weeks of the experiment are as follows: 1. - 300 mV and 38. 4 kilo-ohm for control sample, 2. - 210 mV and 29. 8 kilo-ohm for sample with bitumen coating, 3. - 200 mV and 28. 1 kilo-ohm for sample with enamel paint coating, and 4. - 250 mV and 34. 8 kilo-ohm for sample with local <b>anti-rust</b> <b>paint</b> coating...|$|E
