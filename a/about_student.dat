5|$|Kayibanda {{presided over}} a Hutu {{republic}} for the next decade, ruling in a top down manner similar to the pre-revolution feudal monarchy. In 1973, Hutu army officer Juvénal Habyarimana toppled Kayibanda in a coup. Anti-Tutsi discrimination continued under Habyarimana, but the country enjoyed greater economic prosperity and reduced anti-Tutsi violence. A coffee price collapse in the late 1980s caused a loss of income for Rwanda's wealthy elite, precipitating a political fight for power and access to foreign aid receipts. The family of first lady Agathe Habyarimana, known as the akazu, were the principal winners in this fight. The family had a more respected lineage {{than that of the}} president, having ruled one of the independent states near Gisenyi in the nineteenth century. Habyarimana therefore relied on them in controlling the population of the north-west. The akazu exploited this to their advantage, with Habyarimana increasingly unable to rule without them. The economic crisis forced Habyarimana to heavily reduce the national budget; to quell civil unrest, he declared a commitment to multi-party politics, but did not take any action to bring this <b>about.</b> <b>Student</b> protests followed, and by late 1990 the country was in crisis.|$|E

2500|$|In 2014 NIST {{partnered with}} Yokohama International School and Zurich International School in {{offering}} the Global Citizen Diploma (GCD), an optional, additive certificate that reflects graduates' leadership, service and community engagement.

2500|$|Each {{publication}} {{presents and}} elaborates {{a set of}} standards {{for use in a}} variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing and improving the identified form of evaluation. Each of the standards has been placed in one of four fundamental categories to promote educational evaluations that are proper, useful, feasible, and accurate. [...] In these sets of standards, validity and reliability considerations are covered under the accuracy topic. [...] For example, the student accuracy standards help ensure that student evaluations will provide sound, accurate, and credible information <b>about</b> <b>student</b> learning and performance.|$|E
2500|$|In Tinker, {{the school}} {{principal}} had punished students for wearing black anti-war armbands based on his [...] "undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance" [...] or [...] "mere desire to avoid ... discomfort and unpleasantness". Here, however, the concern <b>about</b> <b>student</b> drug abuse [...] "extends well beyond an abstract desire to avoid controversy". Principal Morse's failure to act against the banner [...] "would send a powerful message to the students in her charge, including Frederick, about how serious the school was {{about the dangers of}} illegal drug use". The First Amendment, concluded the opinion, [...] "does not require schools to tolerate at school events student expression that contributes to those dangers".|$|E

2500|$|In modern-day Georgetown, actress Chris MacNeil {{is living}} on {{location}} with her 12-year-old daughter Regan, where Chris has just wrapped {{the final scene}} of a film <b>about</b> <b>student</b> activism directed by her friend and associate Burke Dennings. After playing with a Ouija board and contacting a supposedly imaginary friend whom she calls Captain Howdy, Regan begins acting strangely, including making mysterious noises, stealing, constantly using obscene language, and exhibiting abnormal strength. Chris hosts a party, only for Regan to come downstairs unannounced, telling one of the guests, who is an astronaut, [...] "You're gonna die up there", and then urinating on the floor. Later, Regan's bed begins to shake violently, adding further to her mother's horror. Chris consults a number of physicians, but Dr. Klein and his associates find nothing physiologically wrong with her daughter, despite Regan undergoing a battery of diagnostic tests.|$|E
2500|$|The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is {{sponsoring}} a multi-year study of value-added modeling with their Measures of Effective Teaching program. [...] Initial results, released in December 2010, indicate that both value-added modeling and student perception of several key teacher traits, such as {{control of the}} classroom and challenging students with rigorous work, correctly identify effective teachers. [...] The study <b>about</b> <b>student</b> evaluations was done by Ronald Ferguson. [...] The study also discovered that teachers who teach to the test are much less effective, and have significantly lower value-added modeling scores, than teachers who promote a deep conceptual understanding of the full curriculum. Reanalysis of the MET report’s results conducted by Jesse Rothstein, an economist and professor at University of California, Berkeley, dispute some of these interpretations, however. Rothstein argues that the analyses in the report do not support the conclusions, and that [...] "interpreted correctly... undermine rather than validate value-added-based approaches to teacher evaluation.” [...] More recent work from the MET project, however, validates the use of value added approaches.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{conflicting}} views <b>about</b> <b>student</b> {{participation in}} extracurricular activities. A predominant {{position is that}} colleges were after [...] "well-rounded bodies of individual specialists", suggesting {{that it is better}} for a student to be deeply involved in one or two activities rather than nine or ten superficially, such as a [...] "violin-playing quarterback" [...] or a [...] "math-medalist poet," [...] and that students should not [...] "overdo it" [...] and that parents should not become overconcerned about their child's extracurricular activities. Applicants who achieve a leadership position in an extracurricular activity are regarded more highly than applicants who merely participate in a bunch of activities. Advisors recommend that a student should choose which extracurricular activities they genuinely care about, pursue them with [...] "gusto" [...] and [...] "joyful commitment" [...] that demonstrates integrity and commitment. And, consistent with this view, is that too many extracurricular activities may look suspect to admissions officers, particularly if it seems unreasonable that any person could be as active and succeed scholastically at the same time. Jobs are generally viewed favorably by admissions committees, including even part-time service jobs such as flipping hamburgers, since it suggests that a student has learned to handle time management, to accept responsibility, and develop people skills. A less dominant position was that it is helpful to be involved in a [...] "variety of activities", including jobs, internships, and community service. Some universities, such as the University of California, have formal programs for spot-checking applications for accuracy, such as sending a follow-up letter to the student asking for proof about an extracurricular activity or summer job. Advisors recommend that extracurricular activities should never interfere with a student's overall academic performance. A student with many extracurricular activities in twelfth grade, but few in preceding years, particularly when the essays focus on the extracurricular activities, is suspect; this suggests an applicant is being coached, and may reflect negatively on an application. Advisors warn against [...] "overscheduling" [...] students with too many activities or courses.|$|E

40|$|This study {{surveyed}} Australian preservice {{primary and}} secondary teachers to investigate their understandings and expectations <b>about</b> <b>students</b> with learning disabilities. Results show that preservice teachers form a negative attribution cycle <b>about</b> <b>students</b> with a learning disability in comparison to a positive attribution cycle formed <b>about</b> <b>students</b> without a learning disability. Furthermore, preservice teachers view students with a learning disability more from a medical model viewpoint that emphasises deficits. Thus, they are generally more positive towards students with a learning disability, less frustrated, more sympathetic, and have lower expectations of their future performances. Philosophically, their educational view towards students with a learning disability is driven by ability, rather than effort, which {{is in contrast to}} their view towards students without a learning disability. Implications for future practice and recommendations for future research will be presented...|$|R
