These patches are compositionally {{similar to other}} crystalline silicic rocks from oceanic spreading centers and differ from rarer abyssal silicic glasses. Crystalline varieties with SiO 2 > 60 wt. % generally have Na/K > 10, whereas silicic glasses have Na/K in the range 3 - 6. While crystal fractionation readily accounts for the Na 2 O and K 2 O contents of abyssal silicic glasses, both the 417 D granophyres and other crystalline <b>abyssal</b> silicic <b>rocks</b> have much lower K 2 O than that predicted by any reasonable crystal-liquid fractionation model. We propose that high-temperature vapor phase transport is responsible for removal of potassium during late-stage crystallization of these rocks.

These observations and interpretations lead to a more confident assignment of high Na/K silicic rocks of oceanic and ophiolitic environments to a cogenetic origin with basaltic oceanic crust...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe mantle and {{continental}} crust [...] Earth's main silicate reservoirs [...] have a lead isotope composition {{that is too}} radiogenic to {{have evolved}} from primitive Solar System material over 4. 57 [*]billion years 1. To account for this imbalance, {{it has been suggested}} that unradiogenic lead may have partitioned into the metallic core 2, 3, 4 or lower continental crust 5. Alternatively, radiogenic lead could have been added to Earth later by meteorite impacts 6. Unradiogenic lead was discovered in fragments of mantle rocks exhumed in the Horoman massif, Japan, implying that the mantle itself may provide a complementary reservoir of unradiogenic lead 7. However, it is unclear why this unradiogenic component is not sampled by the melting that generates oceanic basalts 8. Here we present double-spike lead isotope data for <b>abyssal</b> peridotite <b>rocks,</b> considered to represent suboceanic mantle, exposed on the Atlantic Ocean floor. We find that sulphides dated at about 1. 83 [*]billion years old and trapped as inclusions in silicate minerals preserve extremely unradiogenic lead isotope compositions. This unradiogenic lead could have been prevented from adding significantly to oceanic basalts if either the silicates shield the sulphide inclusions or if the sulphides reside in refractory mantle rocks that are rarely sampled during melting. We conclude that the lead isotope composition of the silicate Earth could be largely balanced by unradiogenic lead in sulphide in the mantle...|$|R
40|$|Deep-water fold thrust belts (DW-FTBs) are {{actually}} several different structural sub-styles considered together. There {{are at least}} four sub-styles in active and passive margins with very different driving mechanisms, structural and stratigraphic histories, hydrocarbon system characteristics, and therefore very different hydrocarbon potential. Subduction-driven active margin DW-FTBs {{were the first to}} be recognized and are geologically widespread. Active-margin DW-FTBs are accretionary prism created by shearing of sediments of the subducted plate. Though common, absence or dilution of <b>abyssal</b> source <b>rocks,</b> combined with commonly poor reservoir quality caused by volcanogenic sediments have often made them unrewarding exploration targets. On passive margins three types of gravity-driven extensional-compressional linked systems predominate. Among these systems we can further discriminate between salt- and shale-dominated systems. Gravitational collapse of shale-dominated sediment piles (Niger Delta, south Texas, and Amazon fan) produces linked extension-compression “couples, ” with a DW-FTB as the distal margin. Productivity is strongly dependent upon migration from deeply-buried source kitchens landward of the DW-FTB. Source kitchens are in turn dependent upon depth of burial, a problematic issue at the distal edge of a delta slope. Massive salt gliding DW-FTBs (Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic salt basins) possess an added complexity in that they grade continuously updip into a salt-tectonic domain. This assemblage is only now being fully-tested, with encouraging results. Last are true gravitational slumps with a DW-FTB at the downdip margin (Equatorial Guinea, South Atlantic salt basins) which differ in that the detachment cuts through stratigraphy.

40|$|The Monte del Estado massif is {{the largest}} and northernmost serpentinized {{peridotite}} belt in southwest Puerto Rico. It is mainly composed of spinel lherzolite and minor harzburgite with variable clinopyroxene modal abundances. Mineral and whole rock major and trace element compositions of peridotites coincide with those of fertile <b>abyssal</b> mantle <b>rocks</b> from mid ocean ridges. Peridotites lost 2 - 14 wt% of relative MgO and variable amounts of CaO by serpentinization and seafloor weathering. HREE contents in whole rock indicate that the Monte del Estado peridotites are residues after low to moderate degrees (2 - 15 %) of fractional partial melting in the spinel stability field. However, very low LREE/HREE and MREE/HREE in clinopyroxene cannot be explained by melting models of a spinel lherzolite source and support that the Monte del Estado peridotites experienced initial low fractional melting degrees (~ 4 %) in the garnet stability field. The relative enrichment of LREE in whole rock is not due to alteration processes but probably reflects the capture of percolating fluid/melt fractions or the crystallization of sub-percent amounts of hydrous minerals (e. g., amphibole, phlogopite) along grain boundaries or as microinclusions in minerals. We propose that the Monte del Estado peridotite belt represents a section of ancient Proto-Caribbean (Atlantic) lithospheric mantle originated by seafloor spreading between North and South America in the Late Jurassic- Early Cretaceous. This portion of oceanic lithospheric mantle was subsequently trapped in the forearc region of the Greater Antilles paleo-island arc generated by the northward subduction of the Caribbean plate beneath the Proto-Caribbean ocean. Finally, the Monte del Estado peridotites belt was emplaced in the Early Cretaceous probably as result {{of the change in}} subduction polarity of the Greater Antilles paleo-island arc without having been significantly modified by subduction processe...|$|R
40|$|Tectonically emplaced" mantle rocks include subcontinental, suboceanic, and subarc mantle {{rocks that}} were tectonically exhumed {{from the upper}} mantle and occur:(i) as {{dispersed}} ultramafic bodies, a few meters to kilometers in size, in suture zones and mountain belts (i. e., the "alpine," or "orogenic" peridotite massifs - De Roever (1957), Thayer (1960), Den Tex (1969));(ii) as the lower ultramafic section of large (tens of kilometers) ophiolite or island arc complexes, obducted on continental margins (e. g., the Oman Ophiolite and the Kohistan Arc Complex - Coleman (1971), Boudier and Coleman (1981), Burg et al. (1998));(iii) exhumed above the sea level in ocean basins (e. g., Zabargad Island in the Red Sea, St. Paul's islets in the Atlantic and Macquarie Island in the southwestern Pacific - Tilley (1947), Melson et al. (1967), Varne and Rubenach (1972), Bonatti et al. (1981)). The "abyssal peridotites" are samples from the oceanic mantle that were dredged on the ocean floor, or recovered from drill cores (e. g., Bonatti et al., 1974; Prinz et al., 1976; Hamlyn and Bonatti, 1980). Altogether, tectonically emplaced and <b>abyssal</b> mantle <b>rocks</b> provide insights into upper mantle compositions and processes that are complementary to the information conveyed by mantle xenoliths (See Chapter 2. 05). They provide coverage to vast regions of the Earth's upper mantle that are sparsely sampled by mantle xenoliths, particularly in the ocean basins and beneath passive continental margins, back-arc basins, and oceanic island arcs. Compared with mantle xenoliths, a disadvantage of some tectonically emplaced mantle rocks for representing mantle compositions is that their original geodynamic setting is not exactly known and their significance is sometimes a subject of speculation. For instance, the provenance of orogenic lherzolite massifs (subcontinental lithosphere versus upwelling asthenosphere) is still debated (Menzies and Dupuy, 1991, and references herein), as is the original setting of ophiolites (mid-ocean ridges versus supra-subduction settings - e. g., Nicolas, 1989). In addition, the mantle structures and mineralogical compositions of tectonically emplaced mantle rocks may be obscured by deformation and metamorphic recrystallization during shallow upwelling, exhumation, and tectonic emplacement. Metamorphic processes range from high-temperature recrystallization in the stability field of plagioclase peridotites (Rampone et al., 1993) to complete serpentinization (e. g., Burkhard and O'Neill, 1988). Some garnet peridotites record even more complex evolutions. They were first buried to, at least, the stability field of garnet peridotites, and, {{in some cases to}} greater than 150 km depths (Dobrzhinetskaya et al., 1996; Green et al., 1997; Liou, 1999). Then, they were exhumed to the surface, dragged by buoyant crustal rocks (Brueckner and Medaris, 2000). Alternatively, several peridotite massifs are sufficiently well preserved to allow the observation of structural relationships between mantle lithologies that are larger than the sampling scale of mantle xenoliths. It is possible in these massifs to evaluate the scale of mantle heterogeneities and the relative timing of mantle processes such as vein injection, melt-rock reaction, deformation, etc [...] . Detailed studies of orogenic and ophiolitic peridotites on centimeter- to kilometer-scale provide invaluable insights into melt transfer mechanisms, such as melt flow in lithospheric vein conduits and wall-rock reactions (Bodinier et al., 1990), melt extraction from mantle sources via channeled porous flow (Kelemen et al., 1995) or propagation of kilometer-scale melting fronts associated with thermalerosion of lithospheric mantle (Lenoir et al., 2001). In contrast, mantle xenoliths may be used to infer either much smaller- or much larger-scale mantle heterogeneities, such as micro-inclusions in minerals (Schiano and Clocchiatti, 1994) or lateral variations between lithospheric provinces (O'Reilly et al., 2001). The abyssal peridotites are generally strongly affected by oceanic hydrothermal alteration. Most often, their whole-rock compositions are strongly modified and cannot be used straightforwardly to assess mantle compositions (e. g., Baker and Beckett, 1999). However, even in the worst cases the samples generally contain fresh, relic minerals (mainly clinopyroxene) that represent the only available direct information on the oceanic upper mantle in large ocean basins, away from hot-spot volcanic centers. In situ trace-element data on clinopyroxenes from abyssal peridotites provide constraints on melting processes at mid-ocean ridges (Johnson et al., 1990). In this chapter, we review the main inferences on upper mantle composition and heterogeneity that may be drawn from geochemical analyses of the major elements, lithophile trace elements, and Nd-Sr isotopes in tectonically emplaced and <b>abyssal</b> mantle <b>rocks.</b> In addition we emphasize important insights into the mechanisms of melt/fluid transfer that can be deduced from detailed studies of these mantle materials...|$|R

30|$|Magnetic {{anomalies}} occurring {{near the}} seafloor can provide vital information {{for understanding the}} development of hydrothermal systems, such as the location, spatial extent, and mineralization histories of these systems. Because magnetic minerals are created, oxidized, and transformed, during hydrothermal processes, the mineralogical composition of hydrothermal systems provide direct evidence {{of the evolution of}} these systems. Reduced magnetization related to hydrothermal processes has been widely observed in volcanic rock-hosted hydrothermal fields located within arc and back-arc settings as well as at mid-ocean ridges (e.g., Tivey et al. 1993; Caratori-Tontini et al. 2012; Honsho et al. 2013; Fujii et al. 2015; Fujii and Okino 2018). Titanomagnetites are altered into less magnetic minerals such as titanomaghemite, titanohematite, and pyrite by contact with circulating, acidic hydrothermal fluid beneath the vent sites. Early studies into the magnetic properties of basalt from terrestrial lava outcrops (Ade-Hall et al. 1971), the ocean floor (Irving 1970; Watkins and Johnson 1971), ocean crustal drilling sites (Ade-Hall et al. 1973), and laboratory experiments (Johnson and Merrill 1972, 1973) have demonstrated that magnetization is significantly affected by low-temperature oxidation (maghemitization), in which the initial titanomagnetite is altered to titanomaghemite. With more extreme alteration, titanomagnetite pseudo-morphs change into titanohematite grains (Ade-Hall et al. 1971). Clues for understanding the behavior of magnetic minerals relative to hydrothermal activity within oceanic crust were obtained from a massive sulfide body in the Troodos Ophiolite complex in Cyprus. This investigation was {{based on the results of}} a magnetic survey that revealed a strong, low magnetic field over a stockwork zone hosted within in a basaltic sequence (Johnson et al. 1982). Studies by Hall (1992) have also revealed that titanomagnetite in the basaltic basement of this area has been replaced by non-magnetic sulfide minerals, and that the basalt itself has been altered to a clay, silica, and chlorite assemblage within the stockwork up-flow zone. Though reduced magnetization related to hydrothermal processes within basaltic rock is well established and utilized for characterizing hydrothermal systems, studies that use the alteration of magnetic rocks to understand such magnetic lows are limited for mid-ocean ridges. Moreover, the effect of seafloor hydrothermal alteration on <b>abyssal</b> basaltic <b>rocks</b> is still poorly understood because it remains difficult to acquire geological samples from the deep sea. To expand magnetic surveys near the seafloor in the Okinawa Trough and to establish benchmarks for interpreting magnetic data from seafloor basalts, material study of such basalts is essential.|$|R

At Site 183, alkali-olivine basalt was recovered underlying the thick sedimentary sequence of the Aleutian <b>Abyssal</b> Plain. The <b>rocks</b> strongly resemble Hawaiian alkali basalts, have high K, Sr, Zr, and Ba contents, and may be associated with the formation of nearby Derickson Seamount. They are inferred to postdate the basement age estimated from magnetic anomalies and to be extrusive onto oceanic crust. Tholeiitic basalt recovered at Site 191 beneath the sedimentary fill of Kamchatka Basin has low K 2 O, Ba, and Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 values similar to midocean ridge tholeiites, but has higher Rb, Sr, and Zr values which follow patterns established for other inter-arc basin basalts. The basalt is probably part of a regionally developed basaltic basement which may have intruded and enveloped older basin deposits in middle Oligocene time. A series of at least five extrusive alkali basalt flows was recovered from near the crest of Meiji Guyot. The rocks are striking in having potassium feldspar cores in most Plagioclase phenocrysts, and in their coarse grain size, reaching sub-gabbroic textures in some flow interiors. Theoretical and experimental data indicate the almost pure potassium feldspar could not crystallize in equilibrium with associated labradorite. Origin as xenocrysts derived from late-stage plutonic differentiation and later inclusion in basaltic lavas is not possible as glassy rinds containing no potassium feldspar xenocrysts. The mineralogy probably results from secondary replacement of calcic Plagioclase cores by potassium-rich alkaline solutions produced during alteration of the basalts...|$|R

Individual oceanic peridotites from ODP drill cores are characterized by variable absolute and relative PGE abundances, but the average PGE {{concentrations of}} both ODP suites are very similar. This indicates that {{the distribution of the}} noble metals in the mantle is characterized by small-scale heterogeneity and large-scale homogeneity. The mean Ru/Ir and Pt/Ir ratios of all ODP peridotites are within 15 % and 3 %, respectively, of CI-chondritic values. These results are consistent with models that advocate that a late veneer of chondritic material provided the present PGE budget of the silicate Earth. The data are not reconcilable {{with the addition of a}} significant amount of differentiated outer core material to the upper mantle. Furthermore, the results of petrogenetic model calculations indicate that the addition of sulfides derived from percolating magmas may be responsible for the variable and generally suprachondritic Pd/Ir ratios observed in <b>abyssal</b> peridotites. Ultramafic <b>rocks</b> from the Horoman peridotite have PGE signatures distinct from abyssal peridotites: Pt/Ir and Pd/Ir are correlated with lithophile element concentrations such that the most fertile lherzolites are characterized by non-primitive PGE ratios. This indicates that processes more complex than simple in-situ melt extraction are required to produce the geochemical systematics, if the Horoman peridotite formed from asthenospheric mantle with chondritic relative PGE abundances. In this case, the PGE results can be explained by melt depletion accompanied or followed by mixing of depleted residues with sulfides, with or without the addition of basaltic melt...|$|R
