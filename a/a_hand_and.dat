5|$|Although {{repeated}} theft can be {{punishable by}} amputation {{of the right}} hand and aggravated theft by the cross-amputation of <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> a foot, only one instance of judicial amputation was reported between 2007 and 2010. Homosexual acts are punishable by flogging, imprisonment or death. Lashings are a common form of punishment and are often imposed for offences against religion and public morality such as drinking alcohol and neglect of prayer and fasting obligations.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 the New York Times {{published}} {{an article on the}} Global Energy Balance Network, a nonprofit founded in 2014 that advocated for people to focus on increasing exercise rather than reducing calorie intake to avoid obesity and to be healthy.

The surgery lasted {{for more than three}} hours and was performed under regional anesthesia. This procedure was done just thirteen days before he left office. For this reason he had <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> finger bandage the day of his farewell speech and the day of the inauguration of George H. W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{versions of}} the Varaha legend {{are found in the}} Taittiriya Aranyaka and the Shatapatha Brahmana. They narrate that the universe was filled with the primordial waters. The earth was the size of <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> was trapped in it. The god Prajapati (the creator-god Brahma) {{in the form of a}} boar (varaha) plunges into the waters and brings the earth out. He also marries the earth thereafter. The Shatapatha Brahmana calls the boar as Emusha. The epic Ramayana and the Vishnu Purana - considered sometimes as the oldest of the Puranic scriptures - are the first to associate Varaha with Vishnu. Various Puranic scriptures including the Agni Purana, the Bhagavata Purana, the Devi Bhagavata Purana, the Padma Purana, the Varaha Purana, the Vayu Purana and the Vishnu Purana narrate the legend of Varaha with some variations.|$|E

25|$|A heavily built man, Burge was a combative {{player who}} was {{regarded}} as quiet and genial off the field.

In a Shield match against New South Wales in 195859, the ball struck him on the pad and went up in the air. Unconsciously, he put up <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> the ball landed in his palm.|$|E
25|$|In Tepetitán he was proclaimed General Commandant of the Liberation Army and {{he proclaimed}} the famous Declaration of Tepetitán on February 16. In it he ordered drastic punishments for murder (death), {{wounding}} someone (loss of a hand), joining the government forces (as specified by law), robbery (loss of <b>a</b> <b>hand)</b> <b>and</b> vagrancy, among other crimes. The declaration also contained {{a section on}} the protection of married women. Aquino also ended payment of taxes to the government, especially on indigo (the main product of the region), banned aguardiente, and proclaimed the end of forced labor. He prohibited collection of debts contracted before the rebellion, with a punishment of ten years in prison.|$|E

But {{at the foot of}} the pyramid, an old woman raises her head to gaze into the sky, and to her right a baby seeks maternal comfort from a clenched-fisted corpse.

25|$|Tradition has it {{that they}} faced a force {{numbering}} between 1000 and 2000 men, although it was probably several thousand, with significant numbers of knights. Sir Gilbert de Greenlaw died at Harlaw and his tombstone at Kinkell Church gives {{an idea of how}} Mar's knights were equipped. Sir Gilbert carries <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> a half sword and wears an open-faced bascinet helmet with a mail-reinforced arming doublet beneath plate armour. Mar's men also carried spears, maces and battle axes. Tradition {{has it that}} the black armour in the entrance hall of Aberdeen's Town House belonged to Robert Davidson, Provost of Aberdeen, who fell in the battle alongside most of the burgesses with him.|$|E
25|$|From Skwentna, {{the route}} follows the Skwentna River into the {{southern}} part of the Alaska Range to Finger Lake. The stretch from Finger Lake to Rainy Pass on Puntilla Lake becomes more difficult, as teams follow the narrow Happy River Gorge, where the trail balances on the side of a heavily forested incline. Rainy Pass is the most dangerous check point in the Iditarod. In 1985, Jerry Austin broke <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> two of his dogs were injured when the sled went out of control and hit a stand of trees. Many others have suffered from this dangerous checkpoint. Rainy Pass is part of the Historic Iditarod Trail, but until 1976 the pass was inaccessible and route detoured through Ptarmigan Pass, also known as Hellsgate, because of the 1964 Good Friday earthquake.|$|E
25|$|The Fürth {{coat of arms}} {{depicts a}} green trefoil (three-leaved clover) on a white (argent) background. The town colours are green and white. The trefoil first {{appeared}} on a seal of {{the governor of the}} city for the Bamberg Diocese, which depicted a trefoil held by <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> between two crescents. Its origin is unclear, but the trefoil probably represents the three powers responsible for Fürth during the Middle Ages as well as being a symbol of the Trinity. From 1792 onward, there were three trefoils on a triple hill. In 1818, the town acquired a new coat of arms depicting a green trefoil surrounded by an oak branch (acorned). This coat of arms was retained for over 100 years. However, in 1939, the oak branch was removed. At that time, a new flag was introduced; it had two green stripes on a green background and the coat of arms on a green background on the upper part. Later, however, the flag was simplified to the colours white (below) and green (above).|$|E
