Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell introduced the Girl Guides in 1910, a parallel movement for girls, sometimes named Girl Scouts. Agnes Baden-Powell became the first president of the Girl Guides when it was formed in 1910, at the request of the girls who attended the Crystal Palace Rally. In 1914, she started Rosebuds—later renamed Brownies—for younger girls. She stepped down as president of the Girl Guides in 1920 in favor of Robert's wife Olave Baden-Powell, who was named Chief Guide (for England) in 1918 and World Chief Guide in 1930. At that time, girls were expected to remain separate from boys because of societal standards, though co-educational youth groups did exist. By the 1990s, two thirds of the Scout organizations belonging to WOSM had become co-educational.|$|E

Christie acknowledged Mark 14s were running deeper than set, but attributed the failures to poor maintenance and errors on the part of the captain and crew. He was convinced the Mark 6 was satisfactory, and ordered all fleet boats to continue to use it. In November 1942, Christie was ordered to return to Newport as Inspector of Ordnance at the Torpedo Station. Newport had become a bottleneck for torpedo manufacture, and the Bureau of Ordnance wanted to advance development of the Mark 18 electric torpedo.

40|$|In dynamic {{distinct}} counting, we want {{to maintain}} a multi-set S of integers under insertions to answer efficiently the query: how many distinct elements are there in S? In external memory, the problem admits two standard solutions. The first one maintains $S$ in a hash structure, so that the distinct count can be incrementally updated after each insertion using O(1) expected I/Os. A query is answered for free. The second one stores S in a linked list, and thus supports an insertion in O(1 /B) amortized I/Os. A query can be answered in O(N/B log_{M/B} (N/B)) I/Os by sorting, where N=|S|, B is the block size, and M is the memory size. In this paper, we show that the above two naive solutions are already optimal within a polylog factor. Specifically, for any Las Vegas structure using N^{O(1) } blocks, if its expected amortized insertion cost is o(1 /log B}), then it must incur Omega(N/(B log B)) expected I/Os answering a query in the worst case, under the (realistic) condition that N is a polynomial of B.

Considering his size, Will deemed it advisable to have Larry and Muggins standing by ready to hold him if he should prove obstreperous. This was a wise precaution, for, the moment Will began to pull at the obstinate grinder, the gigantic Don began to roar and then to struggle. The tooth was terribly firm. Will did not wonder that the native dentist had failed. The first wrench had no effect on it. The second--a very powerful one--was equally futile, but it caused Don Diego to roar hideously and to kick, so Will gave a nod to his assistants, who unceremoniously seized the big man in their iron gripe and held him fast. Then our hero threw all his strength into a final effort, and the tooth came out with a crash, and, along with it, a terrible yell from Don Diego, who sent Larry and Muggins staggering against the wall!

They were ill-equipped for this type of operation, as they were lacking in indirect fire support weapons such as mortars or artillery; they were armed mainly with rifles and a few Bren light machine guns. By 31 May the evacuation was drawing to a close and the commandos, running low on ammunition, rations, and water, fell back towards Sphakia. In the end, {{the vast majority of the}} commandos were left behind on the island, becoming prisoners of war. About 600 of the 800 commandos that had been sent to Crete were listed as killed, missing, or wounded; only 179 commandos managed to get off the island. In April 1941 men from No. 7 Commando took part in the Bardia raid, but by late July 1941 Layforce had been severely reduced in strength. Reinforcements were unlikely given the circumstances. The operational difficulties that had been exposed during the Bardia raid, combined with the inability of the high command to fully embrace the Commando concept, had largely served to make the force ineffective. The decision was made to disband Layforce.|$|E

The following day, Penfold invited Koroma {{and several of}} his associates, along with representatives of Nigeria, the United States, and the UN, to a meeting at the British high commissioner's residence. He found it remarkable that they all attended, but believed it epitomised the esteem in which the office of British high commissioner was held in Sierra Leone. At the meeting, Koroma agreed to open the country's main airport temporarily the next day, which allowed Penfold to organise the evacuation of several planeloads of foreign nationals. The men agreed to reconvene the following day and the meetings continued throughout the week, though almost all diplomatic missions—including those of the UN and US—closed {{over the course of the}} week, leaving just the British and Nigerians in Freetown. In that time, Penfold believed he had persuaded the coup-makers to stand down and allow Kabbah to return but, unbeknownst to the diplomats, the AFRC had invited the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)—the main rebel group in the civil war—to form a joint government in Freetown.|$|E

His situation indeed was more than commonly joyful. He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart, and raise his spirits.

Then it occurred to her, that some one beside herself might be out from the Hut, and that a friend was near.

At first, her presence was not observed; but, no sooner did the stranger catch a glimpse of her person, than he stopped, raised his hands in surprise, laid his rifle against a tree, and sprang forward; the girl closing her eyes, and sinking on the seat, with bowed head, expecting the blow of the deadly tomahawk.|$|R

ITHACA (Information Technology for Humanitarian Assistance, Cooperation and Action) is a non profit association founded by Politecnico di Torino and SITI (Higher Institute for the Environmental Systems) as a joint project with the WFP (World Food Programme). The collaboration with the WFP drives some projects related to Early Warning Systems (i. e. flood and drought monitoring) and Early Impact Systems (e. g. rapid mapping and assessment through remote sensing systems). The Web GIS team has built and is continuously improving a complex architecture based entirely on Open Source tools. This architecture is composed by three main areas: the database environment, the server side logic and the client side logic. Each of them is implemented respecting the MCV (Model Controller View) pattern which means the separation of the different logic layers (database interaction, business logic and presentation). The MCV architecture allows to easily and fast build a Web GIS application for data viewing and exploration.

40|$|International audienceThe flight {{tendency}} of locusts reared solitarily for several generations has been studied. Locusts were suspended {{for two hours}} every other day from individual roundabouts in isolated enclosures excluding all external stimuli; in darkness, artificial or natural light. The results include all types of locust flights as the best flyers were not selected beforehand. Limited continuous flights only occur during {{the first generation of}} solitary locusts. Series of very short flights following one another in rapid succession can often be observed. These series of flights have been called «linked flights». The most usual form of flight activity is a succession of flights each lasting from one to five minutes, separated by rest periods of about the same lenght. Flight activity in light is very low compared with activity in darkness. Natural light inhibits flight much less than artificial light. Flight activity in light as well as in darkness varies according to the individual locust's flight tendency. For both sexes, flight tendency increases to begin with during the first two weeks then becomes irregular or decreases, according to the individual or it's generation. This tendency then increases again and reaches a maximum generally coinciding with sexual maturity. Activity, for both sexes is formed of successive bursts varying in duration and importance. General flight tendency decreases in both sexes after the period corresponding to the first oviposition. Maximum activity is earlier in females than in males. The former possess a superior flight tendency. However there is a certain simultaneity between both sexes during the increase phase of general activity, and the decrease phase caused by ageing. The effect of isolation reaches <b>almost</b> total inhibition <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the first generation. Females maintain their flight tendency better throughout all successive generations reared solitarily. Nous avons étudié l'évolution de la tendance au vol de criquets élevés isolément au cours de plusieurs générations!

Des vols continus et limités ne s'observent qu'en première génération d'isolement. On observe souvent des séries de très courts vols se succédant très vite. L'expression la plus courante de l'activité de vol est une succession de vols de quelques minutes séparés par des moments de repos de durée voisine. L'activité à la lumière est très faible, comparée à celle exprimée à l'obscurité. Elle varie, comme à l'obscurité, en fonction de la tendance au vol. Chez les deux sexes, celle-ci devient maximum le plus souvent avec la maturité sexuelle. L'activité est plus précoce chez les femelles; elle est aussi supérieure à celle des mâles.
