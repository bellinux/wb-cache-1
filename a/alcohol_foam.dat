Our study demonstrates that wound-implanted foams are mainly infiltrated with granulocytes, but that mononuclear cells, including macrophages and minor populations of T, B and natural killer lymphocytes, are also present. We show that foam-infiltrating T cells, especially CD 4 + T cells, constitute a phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous population influenced by wound-infecting bacteria. Thus, T lymphocytes could play a role in wound cleansing.

40|$|Abstract. Bioactive {{glasses are}} {{materials}} {{that have been}} used for the repair and reconstruction of diseased bone tissues, as they exhibit direct bonding with human bone tissues. However, bioactive glasses have low mechanical properties compared to cortical and cancellous bone. On the other hand, composite materials of biodegradable polymers with inorganic bioactive glasses are of particular interest to engineered scaffolds because they often show an excellent balance between strength and toughness and usually improved characteristics compared to their individual components. Composite bioactive glass-polyvinyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>foams</b> for use as scaffolds in tissue engineering were previously developed using the sol-gel route. The goal of this work was the synthesis of composite foams modified with higher amounts of PVA. Samples were characterized by morphological and chemical analysis. The mechanical behavior of the obtained materials was also investigated. The degree of hydrolysis of PVA, concentration of PVA solution and different PVA-bioactive glass composition ratios affect the synthesis procedure. Foams with up to 80 wt% polymer content were obtained. The hybrid scaffolds obtained exhibited macroporous structure with pore size varying from 50 to 600 µm and improved mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundGlioblastoma can mimic various pathologies, {{including}} arteriovenous malformation, hemorrhage from ischemic stroke, cerebral contusion, metastatic disease, lymphoma, and infection. The {{literature is}} limited regarding diagnostic confusion with meningioma. Herein, we present 2 patients that exhibited imaging, including cerebral angiography during preoperative embolization, which {{was consistent with}} meningioma, but where final surgical diagnosis revealed glioblastoma. Case DescriptionCase 1 was a 57 -year-old woman presenting with headache, ataxia, and memory lapses for the past month. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a heterogeneous-enhancing right temporoparietal mass with broad contact along the right tentorium, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cleft sign, and dural tail sign—consistent with meningioma. Patient underwent angiography with successful polyvinyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>foam</b> (PVA) particle embolization of the petrosquamosal branch of the right middle meningeal artery (MMA) and meningeal branch of the right occipital artery, resulting in significant devascularization of the tumor blush. Subsequently, the patient underwent tumor resection, where pathology revealed glioblastoma. Case 2 was a 60 -year-old man presenting with right hemiparesis. Brain MRI demonstrated a left parasagittal, heterogeneous-enhancing mass abutting the falx with a dural tail sign—consistent with meningioma. Patient underwent angiography with successful PVA particle embolization of the left MMA, resulting in significant devascularization of the tumor blush. Patient underwent a tumor resection where pathology revealed glioblastoma. ConclusionsGlioblastoma can mimic meningioma on MRI with dural tail sign, CSF cleft sign, and broad dural contact.

40|$|Introduction: TASH using {{alcohol is}} {{established}} as a highly effective procedure {{in the treatment of}} patients with HOCM worldwide. However there is often produced a complete heart block with need of permanent pacemaker implantation by the procedure. TASH using polyvinyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>foam</b> particles represents a catheter-based therapeutic option in severely symptomatic patients. Therefore this study sought to determine the outcome of this procedure regarding safety and efficacy. Methods: This is the report of 49 patients with HOCM treated by TASH using PVA foam particles in the department of Internal Medicine/Cardiology (German Heart Institute Berlin) between 1998 and 2009. Our analysis gives a comprehensive overview of interventional data, acute- and long-term results as well as complications, event-free survival and survival rate. Results: During the procedure a total amount of 150 to 250 microns of PVA foam particles was injected on average 1, 8 septal arteries (Contour Emboli; Boston Scientific). On average, post procedural serum CK peaked at 414, 4 U/L and CK-MB to 64, 8 U/L. The resting pressure gradient (invasive assessment) was significantly reduced by 81, 6 % (p < 0, 0001). There was no in-hospital mortality or early mortality (within 30 days). In addition during follow-up time patients had a significant reduction of NYHA functional class, LVOTG and IVS thickness. Furthermore no complete heart block with need of permanent pacemaker implantation occurred. Repeat TASH procedures using PVA foam particles were needed in 10 patients (23, 3 %). The cumulative 1 - and 5 -year survival rate after TASH were 97, 4 %. Conclusion: Our data shows that TASH using PVA foam particles successfully and safety relieves LVOTG and improves symptoms of patients. Interestingly there were no TASH-induced AV-conduction disturbances with need of permanent pacemaker implantation. However to confirm our results prospective randomized trials are necessary to evaluate potential benefits of TASH using PVA foam particles over TASH using alcohol...|$|E

40|$|Surgery for hemangioblastoma is {{complicated}} by the tumor's rich vascularity. Preoperative embolization has been used to decrease intraoperative bleeding for arteriovenous malformations, meningio-mas, glomus tumors, and angiofibromas but not, to our knowledge, for an intraaxial tumor. Case Report The patient is a 14 -year-old boy with a family history of von Hippel-Lindau disease. The boy's father died from intracranial manifestations of the disease. Sixteen months before this admission to the hospital, the patient was found to have two cerebellar hemangioblastomas, and one was removed. Blood loss ' at surgery was 600 ml, and achieving hemostasis was difficult. The remaining tumor was rela-tively small and asymptomatic and was left alone. The patient was well at first, but 13 months after the surgery, he began having increasingly frequent headaches, occasional dizzy spells, and pro-gressive left-sided apraxia. A CT scan showed that the tumor had at least doubled in diameter and that hydrocephalus had developed; repeat surgery was contemplated. Because of the excessive bleeding during the patient's previous operation, the surgeon asked us to embolize the lesion preoperatively, and we agreed to do this. Angiography (Fig. 1 A) showed that the tumor's blood supply was solely from the left superior cerebellar artery. We placed a Tracker- 18 catheter- into this artery (Fig. 1 B) and provoked it with a 40 mg Amy tal (amobarbital). This failed to elicit any significant change in the patient's mild left-sided apraxia. We then embolized the artery with 200 - 300 /Lm of polyvinyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>foam</b> particles t suspended in 10 -hexol * (300 mg I/ml).

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{potential}} role of circulatory disturbances in {{the pathogenesis of}} sesamoiditis was investigated by studying the clinical and histological effects of experimental occlusion of the sesamoidean artery, which is the main nutrient artery of the proximal sesamoid bone (PSB). For this purpose, five adult Dutch Warmblood horses were used in which the sesamoidean artery was occluded with polyvinyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>foam</b> particles. Bone labelling was carried out with oxytetracycline and calcein. All animal were checked clinically {{three times a week}} and radiographically at days 14, 21, 28 and 35. At day 35 the animals were killed and the fetlock was dissected and macroscopically evaluated. The PSBs were isolated and radiographed and the soft tissues adjacent to the abaxial side of the PSBs were histologically examined [routine histology and for the neuropeptides substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ]. The PSBs were divided into bony slices which were radiographed and evaluated histologically (routine, SP, CGRP, fluorescence). All horses showed a slight lameness that gradually diminished. Radiographically enlarged vascular channels were seen in only one horse. Histological data showed that on average 60 % (range 37 - 89 %) of the total area had been deprived of vascularization. In two horses an increase in the extent of the arterial network from the basal side of the PSB was seen. Only in the horse with the greatest extent of occlusion were bone necrosis and a reactively increased uptake of fluorochromes adjacent to the occluded arteries found. Bone density did not change. The distribution of neuropeptides in the surrounding soft tissues was not affected by the occlusion. From this study, it can be concluded that {{a large part of the}} arterial supply to the PSB can be interrupted without provoking histological and/or radiographic changes that are consistent with clinical sesamoiditis. Therefore, it seems very improbable that circulatory disturbances are a primary aetiopathogenic factor in the disease...|$|E

This facilitates the subsequent collection of the motors from water after the treatment. Since the as-developed Janus foam motors can effectively integrate intriguing behaviors of the self-propulsion, efficient oil capture, and spontaneous self-assembly, they hold great promise for practical applications in water treatment...|$|R

40|$|Stricter {{emission}} requirements {{have led to}} ship operation on low flashpoint fuels, such as liquefied natural gas and methanol. These differ in many ways from traditional fuels (e. g. heavy fuel oil and marine gas oil), but requirements and guidelines for fire detection and extinguishment have been sparse. This was addressed in the proFLASH project, first theoretically and then experimentally. This report documents the experimental part of the project, focusing on methanol, and gives technical guidance for fire detection and extinguishing systems. It was for example concluded that methanol flames exhibit similar radiation to ethanol in the IR spectrum, despite limited observability in the visual spectrum. Approved IR flame detectors (tested against ethanol) are thereby likely suitable to detect methanol fire; tested detectors could even detect fully obstructed methanol fire. The design concentration of carbon dioxide gas fire-extinguishing systems should be increased from 40 % to 55 % {{to achieve the same}} safety margin for methanol as for traditional fuels. The primary extinguishing mechanism of a water-based fire-extinguishing system used against methanol is dilution, but almost 90 % water may be necessary for extinguishment. Furthermore, dilution makes the methanol flames increasingly invisible. It is recommended to use <b>alcohol</b> resistant <b>foam</b> injection with fixed water-based extinguishing systems, since this significantly reduces the time required for extinguishment. The effectiveness of the system depends on the foam/water application rate. Hence, a higher discharge rate is more effective and a concealed pool is difficult to extinguish. In different compartment fire test scenarios, water-spray with foam injection was more effective against methanol than water-spray without foam against standardized fuels. High and low pressure water mist performed better than water spray against standardized fuels but worse against methanol (with foam injection). proFLAS...|$|R
40|$|Background: Negative {{pressure}} wound {{treatment is}} increasingly used through a Vacuum-Assisted Closure (VAC) device in complex wound situations. For this purpose, sterile polyurethane (PU) and polyvinyl <b>alcohol</b> (PVA) <b>foam</b> dressings are fitted to the wound size {{and covered with}} an adhesive drape to create an airtight seal. Little information exists about the type and quantity of microorganisms within the foams. Therefore, we investigated VAC foams after removal from the wound using a validated method (sonication) to detect the bacterial bioburden in the foam consisting as microbial biofilms. Methods: We prospectively included VAC foams (PU and PVA, KCI, Rümlamg, Switzerland) without antibacterial additions (e. g. silver), which were removed from wounds in patients with chronic ulcers from January 2007 through December 2008. Excluded were patients with acute wound infection, necrotizing fasciitis, underlying osteomyelitis or implant. Removed foams from regular changes of dressing were aseptically placed in a container with 100 ml sterile Ringer's solution. Within 4 hours after removal, foams were sonicated for 5 min at 40 kHz (as described in NEJM 2007; 357 : 654). The resulting sonication fluid was cultured at 37 °C on aerobic blood agar plates for 5 days. Microbes were quantified as No. of colony-forming units (CFU) /ml sonication fluid and identified to the species level. Results: A total of 68 foams (38 PU and 30 PVA) from 55 patients {{were included in the}} study (median age 71 years; range 33 - 88 years, 57 % were man). Foams were removed from the following anatomic sites: sacrum (n= 29), ischium (n= 18), heel (n= 13), calves (n= 6) and ankle (n= 2). The median duration of being in place was 3 days (range, 1 - 8 days). In all 68 foams, bacteria were found in large quantities (median 105 CFU/ml, range 102 - 7 CFU/ml sonication fluid. No differences were found between PU and PVA foams. One type of organisms was found in 11 (16 %), two in 17 (24 %) and 3 or more in 40 (60 %) foams. Gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were isolated in 70 %, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (20 %), koagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci (8 %), and enterococci (2 %). Conclusion: With sonication, a high density of bacteria present in VAC foams was demonstrated after a median of 3 days.

MethodsThe study included all consecutive patients with Szilagyi III groin infections and exposed prosthetic graft material from 2009 to 2011. After initial wound debridement, VAC was applied using a two-layer combination, consisting of polyvinyl alcohol and polyurethane sponges. Continuous negative pressure was set on a maximum of 50 mm Hg. All patients received complementary antibiotic therapy. The primary end point was defined as complete wound closure. Secondary end points comprised bleeding complications, amputation, and death. ResultsThe study evaluated 15 patients with 17 Szilagyi III groin infections. Mean total length of VAC therapy was 43 days (range, 14 - 76 days). Mean time until complete healing was 51 days (range, 24 - 82 days). Mean length of VAC therapy in the hospital was 21 days (range, 5 - 61 days). Eleven patients received continued VAC treatment at home for a mean length of 22 days (range, 5 - 69 days). Complete healing was achieved in 14 groins (82 %). Three failures due to persisting infection, persisting necrosis, and a pseudomonas infection were noted.

40|$|Summary: Direct {{percutaneous}} puncture for coil placement {{has been}} described for visceral aneurysms, but the proce-dure has not been previously reported for aneurysms {{of the head and}} neck. We report a case in which stent-assisted endovascular treatment was successfully combined with direct puncture for additional coil placement to treat a symptomatic giant aneurysm of the cervical internal ca-rotid artery. Pseudoaneurysms of the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) are uncommon lesions that may be in-duced by trauma, dissection, or rarely, infection or tumor invasion (1 – 4). Open surgery for the treatment of such lesions has been partly replaced by endovas-cular treatment alternatives such as balloon occlu-sion, coil embolization, stent placement, and balloon-or stent-assisted coil embolization (1 – 3, 5 – 8). The last technique has found widespread application in the treatment of wide-necked intra- and extracranial an-eurysms, especially in recent years (1 – 3, 6 – 8). Direct percutaneous puncture and embolization of lesions such as arteriovenous malformations and hy-pervascular tumors {{has been described}} for the head and neck region (9, 10). Absolute alcohol, polyvinyl <b>alcohol</b> particles, gelatin <b>foam</b> pledgets, N-butyl cya-noacrylate, and coils have all been used for percuta-neous and transarterial embolization of these lesions (9, 10).

40|$|Magister Pharmaceuticae - MPharmThis {{study was}} based on Dioxy MP 14 (DMP), a brand of {{stabilized}} chlorine dioxide (SCD). The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of DMP is chlorine dioxide (CD) which is a potent oxidant and biocide. These properties have proved invaluable for various applications. The main goals of this study were: {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of DMP for disinfecting Mycobateria tuberculosis (TB) contaminated medical instruments, devices, floors and surfaces; to investigate the stability of DMP; and to explore possibilities for medical application of DMP. Evaluation of disinfectant activity of DMP on TB was performed using the spectrophotometric method, a modification of the European suspension test, EN 14348. M. bovis BCG was employed as surrogate in this test. Results were as follows: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC₉₀) = 12. 5 ppm; the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) = 15. 4 ppm; the Mycobactericidal Effect (ME) = 8. 8 log reduction; and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC₉₀) x minimum exposure time (CT) = 12. 5 ppm. s. The long term stability study of DMP was performed by monitoring the rate of degradation of DMP stored in the fridge (2 - 8 °C), in the oven (40 °C), and under ambient conditions (15 - 30 °C). Analytical methods of assessing DMP concentration was by Iodometric titration method. The shelf life of DMP stored in a transparent bottle at room temperature was 9. 8 weeks, as opposed to 52. 7 weeks when stored in an amber colored reagent bottle at the same temperature. Both oven samples had an expiry date of about 20 weeks and the fridge samples about 70 weeks. Foam formulations for a vaginal douche (VGD), mouth rinse (MRF), and foot/sit bubble bath (F/SBB) ], were developed in the laboratory. DMP and the formulated concentrate were designed to be mixed just prior to administration. During foam evaluation studies, a mechanical overhead stirrer was used to generate foam. Foamability was assessed by quantifying the amount of foam generated. The stability of foams were assessed by: 1) determining the rate of foam decay and the rate of foam drainage observed concurrently from foam loaded in a measuring cylinder; and 2) determining the life span of single bubbles of each foam system i. e. the bubble breaking time (BBT). The density of each foam system was also determined. Potentiometric acid base titration was used to select suitable adjuster alkali, and to show the benefits of employing a buffer. Concentrate development was initiated by a simple mixture of all the ingredients followed by stirring and observing the deviations from desired quality attributes of the product. The subsequent five processes were improvements designed to circumvent the shortcomings of the initial procedure to arrive at the optimized method E. Prototype formulations were employed to optimize excipient quantities to eventually arrive at an optimized master formula. In foam evaluation, it was found that sodium lauryl sulphate/ammonium lauryl sulphate/cocoamidopropyl betaine/cetostearyl <b>alcohol</b> (SLS/ALS/CAPB/CSA) <b>foam</b> system was the most appropriate to use in the formulation. NaOH was selected as the adjuster solution and KHP as the buffer. The dosage formula (DF) of the VGD and F/SBB was determined to be MDF = 5 ml of 50 ppm DMP + 5 ml concentrate + 40 ml water = 50 ml and that of MRF as MDF = 19 ml diluted concentrate + 1 ml of 50 ppm DMP. In conclusion, DMP was found to be a highly effective disinfectant against Mycobacteria. DMP has reasonable shelf life if stored appropriately. Pharmaceutical formulation from DMP was found to be delicate due to the narrow pH window of DMP stability, but is feasible...|$|R
40|$|The first {{intention}} {{of this research}} is to identify specific CO 2 -philic solids from two candidates, namely sugar acetates and tert-butylated aromatics, which can be used to separate high pressure CO 2 from H 2. In this work, many of these solids were found to melt in the presence of high pressure CO 2 (600 ¨C 1000 psi) and absorb large amounts of CO 2. It was hoped that upon exposure to a 1 : 1 CO 2 /H 2 high pressure gas mixture that was selected to be representative of a shifted gasifier effluent stream, the solid would melt and selectively absorb CO 2. Only one candidate, glucose pentaacetate, was found to melt {{in the presence of the}} gas mixture at 25 oC. The pressure of the system was ~ 6000 psia, which is unrealistically high for the commercial application of this process. Therefore mixed gas solubilities in the molten phase were not determined. In a second project, a strategy for using CO 2 -soluble compounds to decrease the mobility of dense CO 2 in porous media was investigated. It is to inject a CO 2 surfactant solution into the porous media, which contains both brine and oil, thereby generating a low mobility emulsion or foam of CO 2 droplets separated by surfactant-stabilized brine lamellae that bridge pore throats. In this work, the surfactants were screened by assessing their ability to stabilize foams when equal volumes of CO 2 and brine were mixed with the amount of surfactant capable of dissolving in the CO 2 at test conditions (e. g. 25 oC and 1300 psia). Stability was assessed by monitoring the rate of collapse of the foam and the appearance of clear zones of excess water and CO 2. We have established the identity of several non-ionic, hydrocarbon-based, commercially available, inexpensive surfactants that can dissolve in CO 2 at typical EOR reservoirs conditions to a high enough concentration (~ 0. 02 - 0. 20 wt%) to form relatively stable emulsions/foams of liquid or supercritical CO 2 droplets separated by films of brine. Although these surfactants are CO 2 -soluble, they are even more water-soluble, therefore they tend to partition into the low-volume brine phase and stabilize the emulsion form emulsions in which the brine is the low-volume (e. g. 10 vol%) continuous phase, in accordance with Bancroft¡¯s rule. The most effective thickeners were branched alkyl phenol ethoxylates, linear alkyl phenol ethoxylates, and linear alkyl ethoxylates. Linear ethoxylated <b>alcohols</b> was ineffective <b>foam</b> stabilizers...|$|R
