5|$|Sea otters {{spend much}} of their time grooming, which {{consists}} of cleaning the fur, untangling knots, removing loose fur, rubbing the fur to squeeze out water and introduce air, and blowing air into the fur. To casual observers, it <b>appears</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the animals are scratching, but they are not known to have lice or other parasites in the fur. When eating, sea otters roll in the water frequently, apparently to wash food scraps from their fur.|$|E
5|$|Popping as an {{umbrella}} term also includes gliding. Gliding is a lower body dance performed {{with little to}} no movements in the chest or arms. In gliding a dancer <b>appears</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they are drifting across the floor on ice. Opposite from gliding is tutting, an upper body dance that uses the arms, hands, and wrists to form right angles and create geometric box-like shapes. Tutting can be done primarily with the fingers rather than the arms. This method is called finger tutting. In both variations the movements are intricate, linear, and form 90° or 45° angles. In practice, tutting looks like the characters {{on the art of}} ancient Egypt, hence the name—a reference to King Tut.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the caps}} {{are covered by}} a peridium—an outer {{covering}} layer of tissue. After the fruit body matures and begins to dry out, {{the lower part of}} the peridium starts to rip, usually starting from small longitudinal slits near where the peridium attaches to the top of the stem. However, the pattern of tearing is variable; in some instances, the slits may appear higher up on the peridium, in others, the peridium rips more irregularly. The peridium may also rip in such a way that it <b>appears</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> there is a ring at the top of the stem. The torn peridium exposes the internal gleba. The gleba is divided into wavy plates or lamellae, some of which are fused together to form irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, and it becomes tough and brittle as it dries out. The flesh is firm when young, white, and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.|$|E

25|$|A hydropathy {{analysis}} of hexokinase in yeast {{has been created}} by these standards. It <b>appears</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> hexokinase possesses a single potential transmembrane domain located around amino acid 400.

25|$|It <b>appears</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{the scant}} {{differences}} between southern Canadian and western U.S. populations result from genetic drift, {{due to the}} recent reduction in population and range fragmentation.

Balanced Rock is perched atop a cliff alongside Great Trough Creek.

Balanced Rock is made up of a hard type of rock that did not erode like the rock surrounding it. As the mountains eroded away Balanced Rock remained.|$|E
25|$|The film {{covers the}} period of previews leading to the play's opening, and with a brief {{exception}} <b>appears</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> filmed in a single shot, an idea Iñárritu had from the film's conception. Emmanuel Lubezki, who won the Academy Award for his cinematography in Birdman, believed that the recording time necessary for the unique long take approach taken in Birdman {{could not have been}} made with older technology. The film was shot in New York City during the spring of 2013 with a budget of $16.5 million jointly financed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, New Regency Pictures and Worldview Entertainment. It premiered the following year in August where it opened the 71st Venice International Film Festival.|$|E

25|$|In the Story of Sanjan, it <b>appears</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the Zoroastrians {{must have}} had some contact with Gujarat prior to their journey there, which has {{prompted}} suggestions that the Zoroastrians of the story were not in fact the first migrants. Whether these were also asylum seekers is unclear, but Iranian influence and emigrants are discernible in India long before the Parsis of the narrative arrive. The text states the migrants knew in advance that Gujarat was governed by a monarch tolerant towards other (i.e. non-Hindu) religious beliefs, and {{this may have been}} determined through trade with the region (the city near Bushire - where the narrative's Zoroastrians are said to have lived for 15 years before setting sail - had extensive trading connections with the east).|$|E
25|$|Winnicott {{thought that}} one of the {{developmental}} hurdles for an infant to get past is the risk of being traumatised by having to be too aware too soon of how small and helpless she really is. A baby who is too aware of real-world dangers will be too anxious to learn optimally. A good-enough parent is well enough attuned and responsive to protect the baby with an illusion of omnipotence, or being all-powerful. For example, a well-cared-for baby usually doesn't feel hungry for very long before being fed. Winnicott thought the parents' quick response of feeding the baby gives the baby a sense that whenever she's hungry, food <b>appears</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> by magic, as if the baby herself makes food appear just by being hungry. To feel this powerful, Winnicott thought, allowed a baby to feel confident, calm and curious, and able to learn without having to invest a lot of energy into defences.|$|E
25|$|Yuma is {{the main}} protagonist of the story, and is in her second {{year of high school}} along with her best friend Hotaru. When she finds her first boyfriend (Takeda) she is not sure how to react so she asks Hotaru for advice. Yuma is {{surprised}} though when it <b>appears</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> her friend is flirting with her. She cannot explain the good feeling she gets when she French kisses Hotaru or when she gets fondled, and worries that Takeda will catch her in the act. In the second volume he decides that the two should take some space apart, and Yuma comes to terms that she is in fact cheating with Hotaru. Her feelings still remain conflicted though as she does not want to hurt him so she remains as a friend. Yuma finally confesses to Hotaru in the fifth manga volume that she has feelings towards her but is rejected. She then turns to Takeda after feeling like she had been used the entire time by her.|$|E

Vasari tells us that the ceiling is [...] "unfinished", that its unveiling occurred before it could be reworked with gold leaf and vivid blue lapis lazuli as was customary with frescoes and in order to better link the ceiling with the walls below it which were highlighted {{with a great deal of}} gold. But this never took place, in part because Michelangelo was reluctant to set up the scaffolding again, and probably also because the gold and particularly the intense blue would have distracted from his painterly conception.|$|E
500|$|The use of {{satellite}} tracking is teaching scientists {{a great deal}} about the way albatrosses forage across the ocean to find food. They undertake no annual migration, but disperse widely after breeding—Southern Hemisphere species often undertake [...] trips. There is also evidence of separate ranges for different species at sea. A comparison of the foraging niches of two related species that breed on Campbell Island, the Campbell albatross and the grey-headed albatross, showed the Campbell albatross primarily fed over the Campbell Plateau whereas the grey-headed albatross fed in more pelagic, oceanic waters. Wandering albatrosses also react strongly to bathymetry, feeding only in waters deeper than 1000m (3281ft); so rigidly did the satellite plots match this contour that one scientist remarked, [...] "It almost <b>appears</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the birds notice and obey a 'No Entry' sign where the water shallows to less than 1000m". There is also evidence of different ranges for the two sexes of the same species; a study of Tristan albatrosses breeding on Gough Island showed that males foraged to the west of Gough and females to the east.|$|E
