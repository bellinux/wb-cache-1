5|$|Before {{the early}} 17th century, the western Petén had been heavily {{populated}} by Ch'ol and Ch'olti' Maya {{and was an}} important trade route for the Itza. By the mid-17th century, these populations had been devastated by war, disease and the enforced movement of the inhabitants into colonial settlements, negating the economic importance of the region for the Itza. At {{the same time the}} Kejache were becoming important intermediaries between the Itza and Yucatán. The Putun Acalan subgroup of the Kejache had previously traded directly with the Itza but had been relocated by the Spanish. The remaining Kejache, devastated by disease <b>and</b> <b>subject</b> to the intense attentions of Spanish missionaries, were no longer able to supply the Itza directly and became middlemen instead.|$|E
5|$|British rule in Nyasaland radically {{altered the}} local {{indigenous}} power structures. The early colonial period saw some immigration and settlement by white colonists, who bought large swathes of territory from local chiefs, often for token payments in beads or guns. Most {{of the land}} acquired, particularly in the Shire Highlands, was converted into white-owned plantations where tea, coffee, cotton and tobacco were grown. The enforcement of colonial institutions, such as the Hut Tax, compelled many indigenous people to find paid work {{and the demand for}} labour created by the plantations, led to their becoming a major employer. Once employed on the plantations, black workers found that they were frequently beaten <b>and</b> <b>subject</b> to racial discrimination. Increasingly, the plantations were also forced to rely on a system of forced labour or corvée, known locally at the thangata.|$|E
