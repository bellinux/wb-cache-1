Marie High School's 1913 state {{championship}} football team. The Sault Ste. Marie “Blue Devils” were a football powerhouse with Weston. In a 1972 interview with his home town newspaper, Weston recalled the 1913 championship team: “We were an awful bunch of roughnecks – there was no football team in the state tougher than we were that year. We blasted all of them and loved doing it.” Weston was asked about a 1913 newspaper report {{that he had been}} tackled by an irate woman during a 24-7 win over Alpena. He recalled the incident:”The game was played there, and the fans hated us. We were too rough to suit them. I was running around the left end toward the Alpena side of the field. There was nobody near me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> the end, and all of a sudden, this woman dives from the sideline and drops me for no gain. Well, I was so surprised I couldn’t get up at first.” ...|$|E
60|$|So he {{kept talking}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran,</b> neither expecting nor {{receiving}} any answer.|$|E

"Don't feel nothing, Major," [...] he answered, [...] "best cork mattress, 25/3 at Stores, {{very good}} for {{poisoned}} arrow, but leave him behind now, because perhaps points work through <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>run,</b> one scratch do trick," [...] and as he spoke Jeekie untied a string or several strings, letting the little mattress fall to the ground.|$|R
5000|$|The proof {{proceeds}} as follows. Let N be {{an infinite}} hyperinteger. Consider a partition of a,b into N intervals of equal length, with partition points xi <b>as</b> <b>i</b> <b>runs</b> from 0 to N. Consider the collection I of indices such that f(xi)>0. Let i0 {{be the least}} element in I (such an element exists by the transfer principle, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> is a hyperfinite set). Then the real number ...|$|R
60|$|Then it was I {{called for}} the Minute Boys to follow me, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> at the best pace {{possible}} in that direction, for there was our post of duty.|$|E
6000|$|Cotton {{glanced over}} his shoulder, then {{gathered}} up his bridle, while, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> towards him, Sally's heart must have failed her, for she called out: [...] "Don't! I'll pay forfeit!" ...|$|E
60|$|I thought Joseph looked {{confused}} {{when he opened}} the house-door to me. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> upstairs, he followed me, saying something. I was in too great a hurry to pay any attention to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{hear the}} {{conductor}} calling 'all aboard' <b>as</b> <b>I</b> enter the depot, my heart first stops, then palpitates, and my legs {{respond to the}} air-waves falling on my tympanum by quickening their movements. If <b>I</b> stumble <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>run,</b> the sensation of falling provokes a movement of the hands towards {{the direction of the}} fall, the effect of which is to shield the body from too sudden a shock. If a cinder enter my eye, its lids close forcibly and a copious flow of tears tends to wash it out.|$|R
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>ran,</b> Sir, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{had never}} <b>run</b> before; the beads of {{perspiration}} poured down from my forehead; the breath came stertorous and hot from my heaving breast.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{strikes me}} <b>as</b> fortunate. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> through the bank account last night, and there's {{no doubt that}} you have {{spent a good deal}} of money. It {{confirms}} my opinion that you have mighty expensive friends." ...|$|R
60|$|My brain grew clearer, and I turned <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> {{and looked}} at the man who was holding me up. He it was who had dragged me out and saved me. He noticed my movement.|$|E
60|$|Without replying, I hurried away; {{the old man}} chasing me, and {{shouting}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran,</b> until I gained the village. Here I dodged him, and made my way home, resolved never to disclose so inglorious an adventure.|$|E
6000|$|... "Weel, I did {{not pass}} quite close to them, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> up here for my horse on hearin' the news," [...] replied Duncan; [...] "but I am pretty sure that I saw her sittin' beside Louise." ...|$|E
5000|$|The first line, {{designated}} <b>as</b> line <b>I,</b> <b>ran</b> {{from the}} Bärengraben (bear pits), {{which was also}} {{the location of the}} depot, to the Bremgartenfriedhof, via Bern railway station. [...] At each terminus, there was a turntable to turn the vehicles.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was a man}} {{in white}} on horseback," [...] said Edie, [...] "for the soft grund that wadna bear the beast, flung him about, I wot that weel; but I didna think my auld legs could have brought me aff <b>as</b> fast; <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> amaist <b>as</b> fast <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> had been at Prestonpans."* ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can <b>run</b> up a {{new house}} at the embarcadero," [...] said Harkutt peevishly, [...] "and that's got to be done mighty quick if I {{want to make a}} show to the company and be in possession." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have run}} repeatedly, but never <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> that day. At night I {{went out of}} town, and there was my own {{particular}} fire, quite distinct from the other, and burning as I thought with even greater vigour.|$|E
6000|$|I {{laughed and}} made my escape, still {{laughing}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> upstairs. [...] "A good idea!" [...] I thought with glee. [...] "I see I have the means of fretting {{him out of his}} melancholy for some time to come." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> {{forward toward}} Perry I fired four more shots, {{dropping}} {{three of our}} antagonists. Then at last the remaining seven wavered. It {{was too much for}} them, this roaring death that leaped, invisible, upon them from a great distance.|$|E
6000|$|... "The letter {{which was}} written to me about you was sent to me in Belgium, at Brussels, where I have been living--a town near {{the place where the}} famous Battle of Waterloo was fought; and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>run</b> away from Waterloo it {{followed}} me to England.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't do it!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I've never 'backed water' in my life, and I won't do it now. I'm not beaten yet. We've {{had three}} bad years in succession--we'll surely have a crop next year. I won't {{surrender}} so long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can <b>run</b> a team." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{probability}} that Bn is any particular partition {{of the set}} { 1, ..., n } {{is the product of}} these probabilities <b>as</b> <b>i</b> <b>runs</b> from 1 to n. Now consider the size of block b: it increases by 1 each time we add one element into it. When the last element in block b is to be added in, the block size is (|b| &minus; 1). For example, consider this sequence of choices: (generate a new block b)(join b)(join b)(join b). In the end, block b has 4 elements and the product of the numerators in the above equation gets θ · 1 · 2 · 3. Following this logic, we obtain Pr(Bn = B) as above.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have a turban. I have been, lately, in {{the dress}} of a peasant. The cloth I wore lies fifty yards away; I dropped it <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran.</b> It {{will be useful}} to cover me at night, if for nothing else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{pretty sure}} she started {{off in a}} diff'rent direction," [...] {{declared}} Trot. [...] "I looked over my shoulder, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran,</b> to see how close the witches were, and I'm sure I saw Gloria walking slowly away toward the north." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was quick}} enough; but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> through the {{shrubbery}} I wondered how one extricates the subaltern {{of the present}} day from a sack without hurting his feelings. Anciently, one slit the end open, taking off his boots first, and then fled.|$|E
60|$|The excited voice went clamouring {{along the}} staircase; and I wrapped myself in my clothes <b>as</b> quickly <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could, and <b>ran</b> into the street.|$|R

60|$|It {{all came}} upon me when I was close upon {{seventeen}} like the bursting of a shell. Somnambulistic country-girls, {{when it is}} upon them, throw plates about or pull them with long hairs in simulation of the polter-geist, or become mediums for some genuine spirit-mischief, surrendering to their desire of the marvellous. As I look backward, I seem to discover that my passions, my loves and my despairs, instead of being my enemies, a disturbance and an attack, became so beautiful that I must be constantly alone to give them my whole attention. I notice that, {{for the first time}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> through my memory, what I saw when alone is more vivid than what I did or saw in company.|$|R
6000|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> out to {{the tennis}} court a few moments later, I had to pass the open boudoir window, {{and was unable to}} help overhearing the {{following}} scrap of dialogue. Mary Cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman desperately controlling herself: ...|$|E
60|$|How many {{thoughts}} {{came into}} my brain <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> along that river road! If that wretched boarder had not taken the rudder for an ironing table he might have steered in shore! Again and again I confounded--as far as mental ejaculations could do it--his suggestions.|$|E
60|$|Nor was {{the night}} blacker than his face, and he took no heed of me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> after him, {{thinking}} selfishly of the sweetmeats he had promised to bring me--but I thought no more of them when I got {{to the door of}} the Red Room.|$|E
50|$|Funding for the TECL {{programme}} was {{sourced by}} the International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) of the International Labour Organization (ILO), from the US Department of Labor.

6000|$|Harry was {{standing}} near, {{and heard the}} words. He {{was close to the}} helm at the time, and watched with intense anxiety as the Chasse Marée ran rapidly down to them. It was clear that {{what had to be done}} must be done quickly, for another flash came up from the cruiser; and although in the din of the wind and the toss of the waves it could not be seen where her shot had fallen, the brightness of the flash showed that she had come up since the last shot was discharged. The Chasse Marée ran down, and as she came her captain stood upon the bulwarks and shouted at the top of his voice [...] "Keep her steady, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> past <b>I</b> will throw a rope." ...|$|R
60|$|Alon. Then, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> told you, <b>run</b> {{quickly to}} the corrigidor, and desire him to come hither in person to examine a malefactor. [WILDBLOOD sneezes within.] Hark! what noise is that within? I think one sneezes.|$|R
