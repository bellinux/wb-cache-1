5|$|At the July 1945 general {{election}} Dunglass lost his Parliamentary {{seat in the}} landslide Labour victory.

Dunglass was appointed <b>a</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bank of Scotland in 1946, and although he never considered banking as a long-term occupation he gained valuable first-hand experience in commerce and finance.
