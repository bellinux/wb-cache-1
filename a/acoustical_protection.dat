40|$|This review {{summarizes}} {{the current status}} of the research and development of natural ventilation-enabling noise control devices for use on the facades of high-rise residential buildings in congested cities. These devices are important for a sustainable urbanized city, as they are supposed to offer good <b>acoustical</b> <b>protection</b> to citizens, allowing for an acceptable level of natural ventilation inside residential units; energy for mechanical ventilation can then be saved. From the information presented in the existing literature, it is concluded that protrusive devices, such as lintels and balconies, are not effective noise screening devices, even if they are installed with sound absorbers and/or reflectors, under the effect of city reverberation. On the contrary, plenum windows and similar structures, which are plenum structures with a staggered air inlet and outlet, are interesting alternatives that are worth rigorous considerations.

As the noise level keeps on increasing, opening windows for natural ventilation has become nearly not possible, especially in urbanized residential areas. Plenum window is the modification of a partially opened double glazing window system to the staggered inlet and outlet window openings which can provide better sound protection to the building {{and at the same}} time can allow certain degree of natural ventilation across it. A series of full-scale laboratory measurements were carried out in order find out the relationship between the important parameters and the acoustical performance of plenum window. From the measurement results, plenum window can attenuated at least 10 dBA traffic noise without treatment inside the window system. It is found that window opening sizes and overlapping width have significant effects on the <b>acoustical</b> <b>protection</b> of plenum window...|$|E
