Although the flies are sluggish, the crabs {{on which they}} reside <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but.</b> Chasing after crabs through a pitch-black jungle (growing on a razor sharp labyrinthine limestone ground), while trying to aspirate flies from their carapaces is not trivial. Obtaining large amounts of flies {{in this way is}} simply a nightmare.|$|E
25|$|Preparations for Saša's and Branka's wedding <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> {{smooth as}} the in-laws {{are unable to}} agree on who picks up the tab. Finally, {{everything}} is ironed out and the civil ceremony takes place {{in front of the}} two sets of families, including Giga and Ema, Viki and Baron (now an official item), and drunken Boba. However, there's a scandal when Branka sees Koka who unknowingly got brought along to the wedding party by her half-sister who is visiting from Switzerland and knows Branka's father.|$|E
500|$|In {{the view}} of John T. Hamilton, writing in The Classical Tradition in 2010, [...] "Our {{knowledge}} of ancient and early medieval thought owes an enormous amount to this encyclopedia, a reflective catalogue of received wisdom, which {{the authors of the}} only complete translation into English introduce as [...] "arguably the most influential book, after the Bible, in the learned world of the Latin West for nearly a thousand years" [...] These days, of course, Isidore and his Etymologies <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> household names... but the Vatican is reportedly considering naming Isidore the patron saint of the Internet, which should make him and his greatest scholarly achievement known, if but dimly, to pretty much everyone." ...|$|E

500|$|Finally, {{there is}} what Francia writes {{himself in his}} [...] "Private Notebook," [...] which is mostly an account of his own life, {{attempts}} to write fiction, diatribes against Patiño and his kind, philosophical musings and ramblings, and other sundry exercises. All of these texts have been edited, for one finds in them, besides the footnotes, indications in italics and within brackets such as [...] "on the margin it is written," [...] "there is {{a hole in the}} paper here," [...] etc. So that while they do not compose a homogeneous text, held together by the rhetorical power of a narrative voice, and in fact <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> homogeneous, these texts bear the presence of the editor in these discrete marks and indications.|$|E
500|$|Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), {{director}} of rival glee club Aural Intensity, seeks out former New Directions member and current Dalton Academy Warbler Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) {{to tell him}} and his friend Blaine (Darren Criss), the Warblers' lead singer, that New Directions is planning a sexually provocative routine for the upcoming Regionals competition, having heard that the judges {{will be looking for}} same. Blaine responds by having the Warblers work up a [...] "sexified" [...] performance of [...] "Animal", with Kurt joining him on lead, but Kurt's [...] "sexy" [...] faces and moves <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but.</b> Kurt insists on remaining ignorant of sexual matters, which Blaine feels is dangerous at their age, so he visits Kurt's father, Burt (Mike O'Malley), and prompts him to give Kurt [...] "the talk" [...] about sex.|$|E
500|$|Science {{fiction writer}} Jerry Pournelle named Starflight his {{game of the}} month for January 1987, stating that it was [...] "as much {{a career as a}} game" [...] and [...] "fascinating". Fellow writer Orson Scott Card wrote, [...] "Starflight is the first science fiction {{computer}} game that actually gives you something of the experience of roaming through the galaxy. ... I have found this game obsessively fascinating—and the graphics and player interface are superb". He called it the [...] "Star Wars of science fiction games. Brilliantly designed and programmed ... the standard against which all other space-exploration games must be measured". Compute! listed it in May 1988 as one of [...] "Our Favorite Games", stating that [...] "Starflight captures the feel of a certain type of science fiction ... the game can take hundreds of hours to play fully, yet those hours <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> boring".|$|E

500|$|Rosas's {{authority}} and influence spread {{far beyond the}} House of Representatives. He exercised tight control over the bureaucracy {{as well as his}} cabinet, stating: [...] "Do not imagine that my Ministers <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> my Secretaries. I put them in their offices to listen and report, and nothing more." [...] His supporters were rewarded with positions within the state apparatus, and anyone he deemed a threat was purged. Opposition newspapers were burned in public squares. Rosas created an elaborate cult of personality, presenting himself as an almighty and fatherlike figure who protected the people. His portraits were carried in street demonstrations and placed on church altars to be venerated. Rosismo was no longer a mere faction within the Federalist ranks; it had become a political movement. As early as 1829, Rosas had confided to an Uruguayan diplomatic envoy: [...] "I tell you I am not a Federalist, and I have never belonged to that party." [...] During his governorship, he still claimed to have favoured Federalism against Unitarianism, although in practice Federalism had by that time been subsumed into the Rosismo movement.|$|E
2500|$|A direct {{response}} from Secretary of State for Defence Michael Fallon, that [...] "Our Armed Forces <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> 'feeble'". Fallon reiterated the government {{position that the}} international aid for law enforcement and women's rights budget should also be taken into account, as he said that [...] "Those who belittle our Armed Forces’ efforts fail to recognise that our national security depends on tackling the causes of instability, not just treating the symptoms." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three-dimensional cakes, off-center cakes, cakes {{with sugar}} shards jutting from them, a {{caramelized}} sugar teeter-totter balancing equal rounds of fruit sorbet and crème fraîche.

[...] "It {{is not my}} tendency to make anything round," [...] she says, and her cakes <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but.</b> Topped with her signature explosion of sugar spirals, pulled sugar ribbons and fruit tuiles, Elizabeth Falkner’s dessert creations have become {{the talk of the}} pastry world.|$|E

2500|$|The Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma are {{the closest}} living {{descendants}} of the Illiniwek Confederacy, having been relocated to Oklahoma in the 19th century. The position of the tribal leadership has evolved over the years. In a television interview with WICD-TV in 1995, Don Giles, then Chief of the Peoria Tribe, said, [...] "To say that we <b>are</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> proud to have these portrayals would be completely wrong. We are proud. We're proud that the University of Illinois, the flagship university of the state, a seat of learning, is drawing on that background of our having been there.
