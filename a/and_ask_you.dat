2500|$|On one {{occasion}} Humph {{announced that they}} had a very distinguished actor as a guest who would join in the game of Mornington Crescent. When the game started, after great ceremony, the penultimate player, the last of the panellists, won on his first move, thus denying the distinguished guest the opportunity to make a single move.

2500|$|One of {{the oldest}} and least {{complicated}} DRM protection methods for computer and Nintendo NES games was when the game would pause <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to look up a certain page in the booklet that came with the game, if you did not have the book or entered the key wrong you could not continue. A product key, a typically alphanumerical serial number used to represent a license to a particular piece of software. During the installation process or launch for the software, the user is asked to input the key; if the key correctly corresponds to a valid license (typically via internal algorithms), the key is accepted, then the user who bought the game can continue. In modern practice, product keys are typically combined with other DRM practices (such as online [...] "activation"), as the software could be cracked to run without a product key, or [...] "keygen" [...] programs could be developed to generate keys that would be accepted.|$|E
