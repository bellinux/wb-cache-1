The latter, who was high in her father's estimation, put forward a German princess to marry Gian Gastone.

5|$|Cartman's {{involvement}} with the fried chicken black market closely mirrors {{the plot of the}} 1983 crime film Scarface, with Cartman in the role of Tony Montana, and Colonel Sanders in the role of Alejandro Sosa. In the episode, Cartman travels to <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>land</b> to meet a dealer, usurps the illegal operation from his local boss, and is ultimately brought down because he becomes addicted to his own product, plot points that mirror the plot of Scarface. Specific scenes patterned after ones in Scarface, include one in which Cartman watches Tommy being executed by being hanged from a helicopter, and the final scene in which Cartman's compound is attacked by gunmen. The episode also includes references to the 1991 crime film New Jack City.|$|E
30|$|The {{model was}} setup {{in such a}} way that the world economy in autarky converges to a unique steady state, which is {{globally}} stable under rational expectations. In such steady state, a country with a more productive agricultural sector accumulates more capital. Introduction of <b>foreign</b> <b>land</b> ownership rights puts a relatively rich/poor country in a advantageous/disadvantageous situation and creates an upward/downward spiral of high/low wage income, and high/low investment in domestic physical capital. The argument of the paper can be used to dispute the claim made in the World Bank annual report that <b>a</b> large‐scale <b>foreign</b> <b>land</b> acquisition is <b>a</b> way to reduce poverty (see World Bank ([17])). Instead, I argue that <b>a</b> large‐scale <b>foreign</b> <b>land</b> acquisition in some cases can create a “win–win” for rich investors and a “lose–lose” outcome for poor, land selling countries.|$|R

5|$|The García {{family is}} an example of this phenomenon. In How the García Girls Lost Their Accents, Alvarez succeeds in {{altering}} the events of her own life to create fiction. The family is displaced to the United States after living an established, upper-class life in the Dominican Republic, and is forced to face the challenges which come along with being an immigrant family in <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>land.</b> Julia Alvarez herself was not born in the Dominican Republic, but in the United States. After her parents' failed attempt at a life in America, she returned to the Dominican Republic at the age of three months as her parents preferred the dictatorship of Trujillo to the US. Clearly in the novel, this is not the case, however throughout, the reader witnesses the Garcia family assimilate into American society. Although their Hispanic roots are reflected in their personalities, it is evident that the stories which focus on the four daughters depict many problems that normal North American girls do.|$|E

An interesting feature of the book is that the accounts of chapters 2-6 and the visions in chapter 7 are in Aramaic (after the first few lines of chapter 2 in Hebrew).

25|$|In his Notes Jefferson {{wrote of}} a plan he {{supported}} in 1779 in the Virginia legislature that would end slavery through the colonization of freed slaves. This plan was widely popular among the French people in 1785 who lauded Jefferson as a philosopher.

25|$|Jeremiah {{was called}} to prophetic {{ministry}} c. 626BC. Jeremiah was called by YHWH to give prophecy of Jerusalem's destruction that would occur by invaders from the north. This was because Israel had been unfaithful {{to the laws of}} the covenant and had forsaken God by worshiping Baal. The people of Israel had even gone as far as building high altars to Baal in order to burn their children in fire as offerings. This nation had deviated so far from God that they had broken the covenant, causing God to withdraw his blessings. Jeremiah was guided by God to proclaim that the nation of Judah would be faced with famine, plundered and taken captive by foreigners who would exile them to <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mokarzel harbored tacit Lebanese separationist {{aspirations}} {{that he did}} not openly advocate {{until the}} Ottoman defeat in World War I. Before the Ottomans' fall, Mokarzel's rhetoric was more diplomatic; unlike Al-Ayam (The Days), another US-based Arabic newspaper, which was openly hostile toward the Ottoman sultan and authorities, Al-Hoda took a more cautious tone, reminding its Arabic-speaking American readers that they were above all, Ottoman settlers in <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>land.</b> In 1894, Mokarzel attended an event honoring the Ottoman sultan, giving an address in French to the assembled notables among whom was the Ottoman consul-general of New York. In 1899, Mokarzel criticized the newly established Young Syria Party that aimed to overthrow the Ottoman government and sought to recruit a militia for that purpose. At {{the turn of the twentieth}} century, Mokarzel began to openly express his disdain for the Ottoman consul in New York. Mokarzel represented the Lebanon League of Progress in the Arab Congress of 1913 in Paris advocating for the autonomy of Mount Lebanon within the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

25|$|Because of this, after World War II ended, {{workers from}} the British Commonwealth were {{encouraged}} to migrate to Oldham, amongst other similarly industrialised English towns, to fill the shortfall of indigenous employees, and thus benefit from increased economic opportunity; albeit from tough unsociable employment regimes in <b>a</b> distinctly <b>foreign</b> <b>land.</b> These migrant groups, initially male Caribbeans and Pakistanis, but later Bangladeshi (then East Pakistani), Indian, Caribbean, and Pakistani families began to arrive in considerable numbers in the 1960s, settling throughout the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham.

25|$|Although not {{cited by}} these authors, two {{historical}} arguments also {{argue for a}} 49-year cycle. The first is that the Samaritans celebrated a 49-year cycle. Although the Samaritans stopped counting for the Jubilee some hundreds of years ago, {{according to a recent}} report an effort is underway to determine the date when counting ceased in order to resume. The counting will again be according to a 49-year cycle. A second historical argument has been presented to the effect that the two instances of a Jubilee mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud (tractates Arakin 12a and Megillah 14b) appear to be proper historical remembrances, because the known calculation methods of rabbinic scholarship were incapable of correctly calculating the dates of the Jubilees mentioned. Rabbinic (Talmudic) scholarship always assumed non-accession reckoning for kings, whereby the first partial year of a king was double-counted both for him and as the last year of the deceased king. This reckoning would give 47 years from the Jubilee mentioned in the 18th year of Josiah (Megillah 14b) to the Jubilee that took place 14 years after Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians (Arakin 12a), whereas the correct difference was 49 years (623 BC to 574 BC). This has been presented as additional evidence that the cycle was 49 years, and further that the cycles were being measured until the last Jubilee in the days of Ezekiel, when the stipulations of the Jubilee year, long neglected except in the counting of the priests, could no longer be observed because the people were captive in <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) 				 California State University, Los Angeles, 2011 Committee members: Mark Wild, Choi Chatterjee, Francisco Balderrama, Cheryl KoosArchitecture, California, Imperialism, Landscape, Race, TravelCalifornia {{became a}} part of the United States in 1850, but two decades later {{travelers}} to the state were still describing it as <b>an</b> exotic, <b>foreign</b> <b>land.</b> Utilizing the Library of Congress Collection, "California As I Saw It," this study examines first hand accounts by travelers and settlers in southern California from 1870 to 1900. This study looks at impressions of landscape, wealth, race and architecture to determine what travelers described as American or foreign, and what role California played in the American imagination during the late 19 th century. This study reveals that Americans constructed their identity against "the other," and used travel narratives to justify American expansion into California by portraying Americans as strong, industrious and progressive, and "foreigners" as lazy, backwards and uncivilized. This study draws parallels between American expansion into California and later American imperial expansion overseas...|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} American Revolutionary War, the United States {{had already begun}} transpacific {{maritime}} trade with China, first with the commercial port of Canton (Guangzhou). There the Chinese became excited about opportunities and curious about America by their contact with American sailors and merchants. The main trade route between the United States and China then was between Canton and New England, where the first Chinese arrived via Cape Horn (as the Panama Canal did not exist then). These Chinese were mainly merchants, sailors, seamen, and students who wanted to see and acquaint themselves with <b>a</b> strange <b>foreign</b> <b>land</b> they had only heard about. However their presence was mostly temporary {{and only a few}} settled there permanently. American missionaries in China also sent small numbers of Chinese boys to the United States for schooling. From 1818 to 1825, five students stayed at the Foreign Mission School in Cornwall, Connecticut. In 1854 Yung Wing became the first Chinese graduate from an American college, Yale University.|$|R

As an individual, she is able to fight her enemies and reclaim her husband. Ultimately, however, she chooses to return to her polygamous relationship with Abdul Moelan, an affirmation of tradition over modernism. In opposition to Siti Akbari, the trader Safi Oedin refuses to live in accordance with the local customs while he is in <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>land</b> and ultimately dies.

500|$|The most {{important}} written references to Vistulans come from The Life of Saint Methodius, {{also known as}} [...] "The Pannonian Legend", most likely written by disciples of Methodius right {{after his death in}} 885. The fragment speaks of a very powerful pagan prince who resided in the Vistulan country, reviled the Christians and caused them great harm. He was warned by emissaries speaking on behalf of the missionary and advised to reform and voluntarily accept baptism in his own homeland. Otherwise, it was predicted, he would be forced to do so in <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>land.</b> According to the Pannonian Legend, that is exactly what eventually did happen. This passage is widely interpreted as an indication that the Vistulans were invaded and overrun by the army of Great Moravia and their pagan prince captured.
