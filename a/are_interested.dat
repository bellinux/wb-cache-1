The story can only be continued by clearing missions and progressing through the campaign. However, players are given the option to skip a mission if they have failed it five times in a row. This gives those who <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> in the story, but less skilled, the chance to continue on with the story without frustration.|$|E

40|$|In this essay, I offer a {{sympathetic}} {{reading of the}} rhetoric(s) of Augustine’s Confessions. First, as a historian of rhetoric I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in what Augustine’s narrative {{can tell us about}} the theory and practice of rhetoric in the late classical period and the early Christian era. From this perspective, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in exploring what Augustine discloses about the rhetoric he learned in the provincial Roman schools, and taught at Carthage, Rome, and Milan. Second, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in Augustine’s own work on rhetoric, especially his De Doctrina Christiana, most of which he composed during the period right before he began the Confessions. In particular, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in how the rhetorical ethics that emerges from Augustine’s formal treatment of Biblical exegesis and preaching, and which distinguishes Augustine’s rhetoric from that of his classical predecessors, can illuminate our interpretation of the Confessions. Finally, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in exploring how the Confessions itself works as a rhetorical text— that is, as a discourse addressed to an audience for the purpose of influence. In particular, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in exploring the specific pastoral functions served by Augustine’s narrative...|$|R

5|$|The {{fossil record}} of the Malagasy {{hippopotamus}} is extensive. At least seven hippopotamus bones show unequivocal signs of butchery, suggesting that they survived until humans arrived on Madagascar. The evidence of humans butchering the hippos also suggests their extinction may have been, in part, due to humans. Despite the discovery of many fossils, the hippos of Madagascar are not very well studied, perhaps because researchers <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> {{in some of the}} more exotic megafauna of Madagascar, such as the giant lemurs and the elephant birds.|$|E
5|$|The structuralist {{movement}} originated {{primarily from}} the work of Durkheim as interpreted by two European anthropologists. Anthony Giddens' theory of structuration draws on the linguistic theory of Ferdinand de Saussure and the French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. In this context, 'structure' refers not to 'social structure' but to the semiotic understanding of human culture as a system of signs. One may delineate four central tenets of structuralism: First, structure is what determines the structure of a whole. Second, structuralists believe that every system has a structure. Third, structuralists <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> in 'structural' laws that deal with coexistence rather than changes. Finally, structures are the 'real things' beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning.|$|E
