50|$|The in vivo test {{normally}} uses mouse {{bone marrow}} or mouse peripheral blood. When {{a bone marrow}} erythroblast develops into a polychromatic erythrocyte, the main nucleus is extruded; any micronucleus that has been formed may remain behind in the otherwise <b>anucleated</b> <b>cytoplasm.</b> Visualisation of micronuclei is facilitated in these cells because they lack a main nucleus. An increase {{in the frequency of}} micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in treated animals is an indication of induced chromosome damage.Micronuclei were first used to quantify chromosomal damage by H.J. Evans et al., in root tips of the Broad Bean, Vicia faba. Subsequently the in vivo assay was developed independently by W. Schmid and by J.A. Heddle and their colleagues. The mouse peripheral blood assay was developed by J.T. MacGregor and has now been adapted for measurement by flow cytometry by A. Tometsko and colleagues. The first use of micronuclei in cultured cells was by J.A. Heddle and colleagues in human lymphocytes. The assay has been improved by M. Fenech and colleagues for use in lymphocytes and other cells in culture cells.|$|E
