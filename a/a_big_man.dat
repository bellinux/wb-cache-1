5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>man,</b> squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>man.</b> He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, 1905, {{before the}} start of the 1905–06 season, Stuart was {{suspended}} from the league after the western teams complained that he had won too many championships and was too rough for the league. He was reinstated by the league on December 30, and joined the Pittsburgh Professionals. After Pittsburgh finished their season, Stuart joined Calumet for one game so they could try to win the league championship, which they lost to the Portage Lakes Hockey Club. Once again he was named best cover-point in the IPHL as he scored eleven goals. <b>A</b> <b>big</b> <b>man</b> with a fluid skating stride, he was considered the finest defenceman of his era for his outstanding play on both offence and defence.|$|E

25|$|Rolf Krage was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>man</b> in {{body and}} soul and was so generous that no one asked him for {{anything}} twice.

25|$|Hoppen {{enjoyed a}} college rivalry with Creighton center and future NBA player Benoit Benjamin. While McDonald's All-American Benjamin {{was a much}} bigger name in {{national}} recruiting scene, Hoppen had {{some of his best}} games in match-ups against the Omaha school. Though <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>man,</b> Hoppen was known as a finesse player with a deft shooting touch. He employed a jump hook {{and a variety of other}} offensive weapons in the paint.|$|E
25|$|Fondy came to {{the majors}} in the Brooklyn Dodgers {{organization}} as a huge slugging first baseman from Fort Worth. A 1949 New York Times article remarked on his speed for <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>man.</b> In spring training he scored from second on a fly ball to right fielder, Carl Furillo, who possessed a rifle arm. Unfortunately for him his path with the Dodgers was blocked by Gil Hodges, who was a mainstay at first base.|$|E
25|$|The 2001–02 saw {{a change}} in the Eastern conference hierarchy; the Sixers were {{eliminated}} {{in the first round of}} the playoffs, while the New Jersey Nets surged to the top of the standings, making it all the way to the Finals against the Lakers (the Nets were swept). Looking for <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>man</b> to compete with the likes of Shaquille O'Neal and Tim Duncan, the Nets sent Keith Van Horn and Todd MacCulloch to Philadelphia in exchange for Mutombo.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>big</b> <b>man,</b> {{standing}} {{six feet}} three inches or 1.90 metres tall, Eady was an all-rounder: a hard-hitting right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. He made 116 and 112 not out for Tasmania against Victoria in 1895 and was picked {{for the tour}} to England in 1896. But he failed to do himself justice, scoring just 12 runs in the Lord's Test match, though he picked up four fairly cheap wickets. He made one more Test appearance in 1901-2, again with little success.|$|E
25|$|At 170cm (5' 7"), Bradman was not <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>man,</b> {{but he was}} {{athletic}} and very fast on his feet. During his developing years, he played cricket on artificial pitches, made of concrete with coir matting stretched tautly over the top. His short stature shaped his early development, as he {{had to deal with}} the high bounce of the ball on this type of pitch. He found that the horizontal-bat shots (such as the hook, pull and cut) were the most productive for run scoring.|$|E
25|$|At the February 2001 trade deadline, the Hawks traded Mutombo to the Eastern Conference-leading Philadelphia 76ers, {{along with}} Roshown McLeod, in {{exchange}} for Pepe Sánchez, Toni Kukoč, Nazr Mohammed, and injured center Theo Ratliff. One week earlier, Mutombo played in the All-Star game; he led the game with 22 rebounds and 3 blocks. Along with game MVP Allen Iverson and coach Larry Brown, both of the 76ers, the East rallied from a 95–74 fourth quarter deficit to win 111-110 on Mutombo and Iverson's strong performances. After the game, rumors began of a trade sending Mutombo to Philadelphia. With Ratliff out {{for the remainder of}} the year, the Sixers needed <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>man</b> to compete with potential matchups against Western Conference powers Vlade Divac, Tim Duncan, David Robinson or Shaquille O'Neal, should they reach the finals.|$|E

25|$|However, Krause {{also made}} many picks {{that did not}} help the team. In 1986, Krause planned on {{selecting}} a tall forward named Brad Sellers in the NBA Draft. Sellers, Krause reasoned, was too good a pick to pass up, as he handled the ball very well for <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>man,</b> and also had a solid outside jumper. Jordan, on the other hand, pushed management to take a two-way guard from Duke named Johnny Dawkins. It looked as though Krause would take Dawkins even {{as late as the}} morning of the draft; the coaches and players had {{made it clear that they}} wanted him and not Sellers, and Krause did not particularly have a problem with Dawkins' game. The Bulls' head coach at the time, Doug Collins, even told Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski the night before the draft that the team would pick Dawkins. However, Krause ignored everyone and picked Sellers anyway, and spent the summer trying to sell him to Jordan. Jordan went after Sellers mercilessly in practice, and Sellers was traded after three seasons. He played six total seasons in the NBA, averaging 6.3 points per game. Dawkins played for nine seasons in the NBA and averaged 11.1 points per game, though he did suffer from various injuries throughout his career.|$|E

[...] He retained a fondness for theaters, and referred to them as [...] "palaces"; he also likened them to his [...] "living room", where he would privately entertain guests.

One hour ago, I was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>man.</b> I was important out there. Now it's empty. It's all gone." ...|$|E

60|$|Now Idernes and I were smiting at each other. He was a {{taller and}} <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>man</b> than myself, but older {{and one who}} had lived too well.

500|$|By {{contemporary}} accounts, d'Hautpoul was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>man,</b> possibly {{taller than}} Joachim Murat, who was nearly six feet tall. Endowed with {{broad shoulders and}} a big voice. He spoke {{the language of the}} common soldier, and led from the front. Early in the French Revolution, commissioners visited the various regiments to weed out dangerous, and prospectively traitorous nobles; generally, [...] the commissioners cowed the army into submission, but d'Hautpoul's cavalry regiment refused to be intimidated. When the commissioners came for their colonel, a scion of impoverished nobility, his soldiers refused to give him up: [...] "No d'Hautpoul, no 6th Chasseurs." [...] Thus, despite his noble birth, at the exhortations of his soldiers he remained in the French Revolutionary Army.|$|E
500|$|In 1914, {{at the age}} of 22, he {{enrolled}} at Vanderbilt University and {{was a member of the}} football, basketball, baseball, and track and field teams, earning a total of thirteen varsity letters. One source called Cody: [...] "the interference-smashingest, goal-cageingest, home-run knockingest, super-athlete in all Dixie." [...] Nashville Banner sportswriter and Vanderbilt alumnus Fred Russell described Cody: [...] "When I think of Josh in his college days, I get a mental picture of this great big fellow playing catcher in the spring between innings running out beyond the outfield to throw the shot or the discus in his baseball uniform. He was unbelievably skilled and nimble for <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>man</b> in basketball, and in football where he's a legend." ...|$|E
500|$|Daniel Boone was {{the subject}} of a TV series that ran on NBC from 1964 to 1970. In the popular theme song for the series, Boone was {{described}} as a [...] "big man" [...] in a [...] "coonskin cap", and the [...] "rippin'est, roarin'est, fightin'est man the frontier ever knew!" [...] This did not describe the real Daniel Boone, who was not <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>man</b> and did not wear a coonskin cap. Boone was portrayed this way because Fess Parker, the tall actor who played Boone, was essentially reprising his role as Davy Crockett from an earlier TV series. That Boone could be portrayed the same way as Crockett, another American frontiersman with a very different persona, was another example of how Boone's image could be reshaped to suit popular tastes.|$|E
