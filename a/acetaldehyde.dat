5|$|The fungus {{contains}} a cyclopropylglutamine compound called coprine. Its active metabolite, 1-aminocyclopropanol, blocks {{the action of}} an enzyme, <b>acetaldehyde</b> dehydrogenase, which breaks down <b>acetaldehyde</b> in the body. <b>Acetaldehyde</b> is an intermediate metabolite of ethanol and is responsible for most symptoms of a hangover; its effect on autonomic β receptors {{is responsible for the}} vasomotor symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the commercialization}} of the Monsanto process, most acetic acid was {{produced}} by oxidation of <b>acetaldehyde.</b> This remains the second-most-important manufacturing method, although it is usually not competitive with the carbonylation of methanol. The <b>acetaldehyde</b> can be produced by hydration of acetylene. This was the dominant technology in the early 1900s.|$|E
5|$|<b>Acetaldehyde</b> may be {{prepared}} from ethylene via the Wacker process, and then oxidised as above.|$|E
5|$|Disulfiram (Antabuse) {{prevents}} {{the elimination of}} <b>acetaldehyde,</b> a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol. <b>Acetaldehyde</b> itself {{is the cause of}} many hangover symptoms from alcohol use. The overall effect is severe discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely fast-acting and long-lasting uncomfortable hangover. This discourages an alcoholic from drinking in significant amounts while they take the medicine.|$|E
5|$|Under similar {{conditions}} and using similar catalysts as {{are used for}} butane oxidation, the oxygen in air to produce acetic acid can oxidize <b>acetaldehyde.</b>|$|E
5|$|The name {{actinium}} originates {{from the}} Ancient Greek aktis, aktinos (ακτίς, ακτίνος), meaning beam or ray. Its symbol Ac {{is also used}} in abbreviations of other compounds {{that have nothing to}} do with actinium, such as acetyl, acetate and sometimes <b>acetaldehyde.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} of the toxic constituents eluded researchers until 1968, when <b>acetaldehyde</b> N-methyl-N-formylhydrazone, better known as gyromitrin, was isolated. Gyromitrin is a volatile water-soluble hydrazine compound hydrolyzed in the body into monomethylhydrazine (MMH). Other N-methyl-N-formylhydrazone derivatives have been isolated in subsequent research, although they are present in smaller amounts. These other compounds would also produce monomethylhydrazine when hydrolyzed, although it remains unclear how much each contributes to the false morel's toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) {{have been}} known to prolong and enhance the effects of psilocybin. Alcohol {{consumption}} may enhance the effects of psilocybin, because <b>acetaldehyde,</b> one of the primary breakdown metabolites of consumed alcohol, reacts with biogenic amines present in the body to produce MAOIs related to tetrahydroisoquinoline and β-carboline. Tobacco smokers may also experience more powerful effects with psilocybin, because tobacco smoke exposure decreases the activity of MAO in the brain and peripheral organs.|$|E
5|$|Most acetate esters, however, are {{produced}} from <b>acetaldehyde</b> using the Tishchenko reaction. In addition, ether acetates {{are used as}} solvents for nitrocellulose, acrylic lacquers, varnish removers, and wood stains. First, glycol monoethers {{are produced}} from ethylene oxide or propylene oxide with alcohol, which are then esterified with acetic acid. The three major products are {{ethylene glycol monoethyl ether}} acetate (EEA), ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate (EBA), and propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMA, more commonly known as PGMEA in semiconductor manufacturing processes, where it is used as a resist solvent). This application consumes about 15% to 20% of worldwide acetic acid. Ether acetates, for example EEA, {{have been shown to be}} harmful to human reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Silver metal {{is a good}} {{catalyst}} for oxidation reactions; {{in fact it is}} somewhat too good for most purposes, as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of organic substances to carbon dioxide and water, and hence coarser-grained silver tends to be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on α-Al2O3 or silicates is a {{catalyst for}} the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230–270°C. Dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at 600–720°C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone. In the gas phase, glycol yields glyoxal and ethanol yields <b>acetaldehyde,</b> while organic amines are dehydrated to nitriles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acetaldehyde</b> is {{toxic to}} {{peripheral}} nerves. There are {{increased levels of}} <b>acetaldehyde</b> produced during ethanol metabolism. If the <b>acetaldehyde</b> is not metabolized quickly the nerves may {{be affected by the}} accumulation of <b>acetaldehyde</b> to toxic levels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acetaldehyde</b> is a colorless, {{volatile}} substance with a fruity smell. Although it forms naturally in some fruit, {{it can cause}} an off-taste in bottled water. <b>Acetaldehyde</b> forms by degradation of PET through the mishandling of the material. High temperatures (PET decomposes above 300°C or 570°F), high pressures, extruder speeds (excessive shear flow raises temperature), and long barrel residence times all contribute {{to the production of}} <b>acetaldehyde.</b> When <b>acetaldehyde</b> is produced, some of it remains dissolved in the walls of a container and then diffuses into the product stored inside, altering the taste and aroma. This is not such a problem for non-consumables (such as shampoo), for fruit juices (which already contain <b>acetaldehyde),</b> or for strong-tasting drinks like soft drinks. For bottled water, however, low <b>acetaldehyde</b> content is quite important, because, if nothing masks the aroma, even extremely low concentrations (10–20 parts per billion in the water) of <b>acetaldehyde</b> can produce an off-taste.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acetaldehyde</b> {{has been}} found in {{cannabis}} smoke. This finding emerged through the use of new chemical techniques that demonstrated the <b>acetaldehyde</b> present was causing DNA damage in laboratory settings.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acetaldehyde</b> is an {{intermediate}} product of yeast fermentation; however, {{it is more}} commonly associated with ethanol oxidation catalysed by the enzyme ethanol dehydrogenase. <b>Acetaldehyde</b> production is also associated {{with the presence of}} surface film forming yeasts and bacteria, such as acetic acid bacteria, which form the compound by the decarboxylation of pyruvate. The sensory threshold for <b>acetaldehyde</b> is 100-125 mg/L. Beyond this level it imparts a sherry type character to the wine which can also be described as green apple, sour and metallic. <b>Acetaldehyde</b> intoxication is also implicated in hangovers.|$|E
25|$|The moiety CH3CHO* {{represents}} a short-lived (lifetime of 10−8.5 seconds), activated molecule of <b>acetaldehyde.</b> Its excess energy is about 355.6 kJ/mol, which exceeds by 29.3 kJ/mol the binding {{energy of the}} C-C bond in <b>acetaldehyde.</b>|$|E
25|$|Oxidation of {{p-xylene}} with {{acetic acid}} solvent and cobalt catalyst with <b>acetaldehyde</b> activator at 120–140°C with residence time {{greater than or}} equal to 2 hours. Bromine is now being used in place of <b>acetaldehyde.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{also thought}} there {{is perhaps a}} genetic {{predisposition}} for some alcoholics that results in increased frequency of alcoholic polyneuropathy in certain ethnic groups. During the body’s processing of alcohol, ethanol is oxidized to <b>acetaldehyde</b> mainly by alcohol dehydrogenase; <b>acetaldehyde</b> is then oxidized to acetate mainly by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). ALDH2 is an isozyme of ALDH and ALDH2 has a polymorphism (ALDH2*2, Glu487Lys) that makes ADLH2 inactive; this allele is more prevalent among Southeast and East Asians and results in a failure to quickly metabolize <b>acetaldehyde.</b> The neurotoxicity resulting from the accumulation of <b>acetaldehyde</b> {{may play a role}} in the pathogenesis of alcoholic polyneuropathy.|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} 818 heavy {{drinkers}} {{found that those}} exposed to more <b>acetaldehyde</b> than normal through a defect in the gene for <b>acetaldehyde</b> dehydrogenase {{are at greater risk}} of developing cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract and liver.|$|E
25|$|Another {{oxidation}} route {{significant in}} industry is the Wacker process, whereby ethylene is oxidized to <b>acetaldehyde</b> {{in the presence}} of copper and palladium catalysts (<b>acetaldehyde</b> is also produced on a large scale by the hydration of acetylene).|$|E
25|$|China is {{the largest}} {{consumer}} of <b>acetaldehyde</b> in the world, accounting for almost half of global consumption in 2012. Major use has been the production of acetic acid. Other uses such as pyridines and pentaerythritol are expected to grow faster than acetic acid, but the volumes are not large enough to offset the decline in acetic acid. As a consequence, overall <b>acetaldehyde</b> consumption in China may grow slightly at 1.6% per year through 2018. Western Europe is the second-largest consumer of <b>acetaldehyde</b> worldwide, accounting for 20% of world consumption in 2012. As with China, the Western European <b>acetaldehyde</b> market {{is expected to increase}} only very slightly at 1% per year during 2012–2018. However, Japan could emerge as a potential consumer for <b>acetaldehyde</b> in next five years due to newfound use in commercial production of butadiene. The supply of butadiene has been volatile in Japan and the rest of Asia. This should provide the much needed boost to the flat market, as of 2013.|$|E
25|$|In a Strecker reaction, <b>acetaldehyde</b> {{condenses}} with cyanide and ammonia to give, after hydrolysis, {{the amino}} acid alanine. <b>Acetaldehyde</b> can condense with amines to yield imines; for example, with cyclohexylamine to give N-ethylidenecyclohexylamine. These imines {{can be used}} to direct subsequent reactions like an aldol condensation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acetaldehyde</b> (systematic name ethanal) is {{an organic}} {{chemical}} compound with the formula CH3CHO, sometimes abbreviated by chemists as MeCHO (Me = methyl). It {{is one of}} the most important aldehydes, occurring widely in nature and being produced on a large scale in industry. <b>Acetaldehyde</b> occurs naturally in coffee, bread, and ripe fruit, and is produced by plants. It is also produced by the partial oxidation of ethanol by the liver enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and may be a contributing factor to hangovers from alcohol consumption. Pathways of exposure include air, water, land, or groundwater, as well as drink and smoke. Consumption of disulfiram inhibits <b>acetaldehyde</b> dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of <b>acetaldehyde,</b> thereby causing it to build up in the body.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol's {{toxicity}} {{is largely}} caused by its primary metabolite, <b>acetaldehyde</b> (systematically ethanal) and secondary metabolite, acetic acid. Many primary alcohols are metabolized into aldehydes then to carboxylic acids whose toxicities {{are similar to}} <b>acetaldehyde</b> and acetic acid. Metabolite toxicity is reduced in rats fed N-acetylcysteine and thiamine.|$|E
25|$|The {{equilibrium}} constant is 6 at room temperature, thus that the relative {{amount of the}} enol form {{in a sample of}} <b>acetaldehyde</b> is very small. At room temperature, <b>acetaldehyde</b> (CH3CH=O) is more stable than vinyl alcohol (CH2=CHOH) by 42.7 kJ/mol: Overall the keto-enol tautomerization occurs slowly but is catalyzed by acids.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acetaldehyde</b> is {{also created}} by thermal {{degradation}} or ultraviolet photo-degradation of some thermoplastic polymers {{during or after}} manufacture. One common example occurs when {{a bottle of water}} is left in a hot car for a few hours on a hot, sunny day, and one notices its strange sweet taste in the water from the breakdown of the polyethylene terephthalate (PETE) container. The water industry generally recognizes 20–40 ppb as the taste/odor threshold for <b>acetaldehyde.</b> The level at which an average consumer could detect <b>acetaldehyde</b> is still considerably lower than any toxicity.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, some strains of O. oeni {{were shown to}} use <b>acetaldehyde</b> by {{breaking}} it down into ethanol or acetic acid. While this may help for wines with excessive levels of <b>acetaldehyde,</b> for red wines, it can also destabilize {{the color of the}} wine by interfering with acetaldehyde's reaction with anthocyanins to create polymeric pigments that help create a wine's color.|$|E
25|$|This {{method is}} one of the oldest routes for the {{industrial}} of preparation of <b>acetaldehyde.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Acetaldehyde</b> {{may also}} {{influence}} glutathione peroxidase, a key antioxidant enzyme, {{and increases the}} susceptibility to oxidative stress.|$|E
25|$|The {{threshold}} {{limit value}} is 25ppm (STEL/ceiling value) and the MAK (Maximum Workplace Concentration) is 50 ppm. At 50 ppm <b>acetaldehyde,</b> no irritation or local tissue damage in the nasal mucosa is observed. When {{taken up by the}} organism, <b>acetaldehyde</b> is metabolized rapidly in the liver to acetic acid. Only a small proportion is exhaled unchanged. After intravenous injection, the half-life in the blood is approximately 90 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Like alcohol dehydrogenase, {{catalase}} converts ethanol to <b>acetaldehyde,</b> but it {{is unlikely}} that this reaction is physiologically significant.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol is dehydrogenated to <b>acetaldehyde</b> by alcohol dehydrogenase, {{and further}} into acetic acid by <b>acetaldehyde</b> dehydrogenase. During this {{reaction}} 2 NADH are produced. If {{large amounts of}} ethanol are present, then large amounts of NADH are produced, leading to a depletion of NAD+. Thus, the conversion of pyruvate to lactate is increased due to the associated regeneration of NAD+. Therefore, anion-gap metabolic acidosis (lactic acidosis) may ensue in ethanol poisoning.|$|E
25|$|The Chisso Minamata factory {{first started}} <b>acetaldehyde</b> {{production}} in 1932, producing 210tons that year. By 1951, production had jumped to 6,000tons {{per year and}} reached a peak of 45,245 tons in 1960. Throughout, the Chisso factory's output amounted to between a quarter {{and a third of}} Japan's total <b>acetaldehyde</b> production. The chemical reaction used to produce the <b>acetaldehyde</b> used mercury sulfate as a catalyst. Starting August 1951, the co-catalyst was changed from manganese dioxide to ferric sulfide. A side reaction of this catalytic cycle led to the production of a small amount of an organic mercury compound, namely methylmercury. This highly toxic compound was released into Minamata Bay from the change of the co-catalyst in 1951 until 1968, when this production method was discontinued.|$|E
25|$|Cigarette smoking: <b>acetaldehyde</b> {{which is}} absorbed from {{cigarette}} smoking during alcohol consumption {{is regarded as}} a contributor to alcohol hangover symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The drug {{disulfiram}} (Antabuse) {{prevents the}} oxidation of <b>acetaldehyde</b> to acetic acid. Antabuse is sometimes {{used as a}} deterrent for alcoholics wishing to stay sober.|$|E
25|$|In {{absence of}} a catalyst, the thermal {{isomerization}} of ethylene oxide is never selective and apart from <b>acetaldehyde</b> yields significant amount of by-products (see section Thermal decomposition).|$|E
25|$|The {{placenta}} allows {{free entry}} of ethanol and toxic metabolites like <b>acetaldehyde</b> into the fetal compartment. The so-called placental barrier is no barrier {{with respect to}} ethanol.|$|E
