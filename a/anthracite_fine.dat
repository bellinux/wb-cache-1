40|$|Abstract: Stirred pulp-mixing is {{performed}} before coal flotation. In this study, a two-stage stirred pulp-mixing tank was designed {{based on the}} single-stirred process to intensify the mixing effect of pulp and flotation reagents. A tank has a pitched-impeller opening-type turbine. Stirred pulp-mixing and flotation experiments were conducted on a sample of <b>anthracite</b> <b>fine</b> coal (- 0. 5 mm) from the Xuehu Coal Preparation Plant in Henan Province, China. The results of the two-stage stirred pulp-mixing were {{compared with those of}} a single-stage stirred pulp-mixing in terms of flotation performance. Compared with the single-stage stirred pulp-mixing, two mixing areas and double-layer impeller were able to strengthen the energy input to the stirred system, thereby improving the mixing efficiency of flotation reagents and coal particles in the pulp. The two-stage stirred pulp-mixing significantly increased the flotation feed rate of the cyclone-static micro-bubble flotation column and concentrate yield, enhanced the combustible matter recovery effect of coarse particles at a suitable flotation feed rate, and ensured the recovery effect of fine particles at high flotation feed rate...|$|E
40|$|Xstrata has {{modified}} {{and improved}} on the solid state reduction of chromite (SRC) process that was pioneered by Showa Denko in Japan and previously used at Xstrata’s Lydenburg plant. The history of pre-reduction {{is a long}} one, with the SRC process being {{the first and only}} commercially successful one prior to Premus. Krupp developed the chromite direct reduction and the rotary hearth for the pre-reduction of chromite. However, these processes have not been successfully commercialised. The are a number of significant differences between Xstrata’s patented Premus and the original Consoli-dated Metallurgical Industries (CMI) process. These include, the use of lower cost <b>anthracite</b> <b>fines</b> as the reductant source together with the use of unactivated bentonite as the binding agent. In addition the use of oxygen as an energy source is used in Premus but not in the original CMI process. There was a fundamental change in the operational philosophy of the process in that while the original CMI process aimed to maximize metallization of the pellets, the Premus process seeks to maximize the energy output from the kiln while still achieving the required efficiencies and hence increasing furnace output. Premus is designed to reduce elec-trical energy consumption, provide high recoveries of metallic oxides, and utilizes low cost reductant and en-ergy sources such as anthracite and oxygen respectively. Due to the fact that Premus {{is one of the most}} technologically advanced and competitive processes used today in the production of ferrochrome it was the process selected for Xstrata’s new ferrochrome facility, Project Lion, that is due to be commissioned in the third quarter of 2006 in the Steelpoort Valley in Mpumulanga, South Africa. 1...|$|R

40|$|Reducibility of {{iron bearing}} {{material}} {{is an important}} property which represents its suitability of reduction in iron making furnaces. It has direct influence on improving productivity and lowering energy consumption in iron making process. The reducibility of iron ore pellets of a specific chemistry can be improved by the optimization of physical parameters such as induration temperature, improving size distribution of fines, improving apparent porosity etc. In this study, the reference pellet is prepared in a typical plant condition and {{the properties of the}} reference pellet are considered as base value to improve reducibility index (RI) maintaining other properties at the acceptable limit without altering pellet chemistry. Optimization of induration temperature at the 1250 - 1275 ºC shows around 74 % RI, which is 5 points more than the base value of 69. 5 %. Furthermore, on optimizing additives size, such as limestone <b>fines</b> and <b>anthracite</b> coal <b>fines</b> at - 350 mesh and induration temperature of 1250 - 1275 ºC, RI is improved to 77 %, i. e., 8 points improvement is achieved with respect to the base value...|$|R
60|$|And now, {{as the two}} stood {{frozen in}} terror, I saw the author of that fearsome sound {{creeping}} stealthily into view. It was a huge tiger--such as hunted the great Bos through the jungles primeval when the world was young. In contour and markings it was not unlike the noblest of the Bengals of our own world, but as its dimensions were exaggerated to colossal proportions so too were its colorings exaggerated. Its vivid yellows fairly screamed aloud; its whites were as eider down; its blacks glossy as the <b>finest</b> <b>anthracite</b> coal, and its coat long and shaggy as a mountain goat. That {{it is a beautiful}} animal there is no gainsaying, but if its size and colors are magnified here within Pellucidar, so is the ferocity of its disposition. It is not the occasional member of its species that is a man hunter--all are man hunters; but they do not confine their foraging to man alone, for there is no flesh or fish within Pellucidar that they will not eat with relish in the constant efforts which they make to furnish their huge carcasses with sufficient sustenance to maintain their mighty thews.|$|R
40|$|Permeability {{is a key}} {{parameter}} in {{the production}} of coal seam gas (CSG). Laboratory experiments have been carried out extensively to study the coal permeability. Typical approach includes injection of fluids (e. g. water and gas) through coal samples and permeability can be determined from measured pressure drop across the sample and flow rate. Some of these studies have demonstrated coal permeability variation during water/gas flow. These permeability variations have been attributed to physical blockage of flow paths by fines migration and/or coal creep. Investigation of these studies has indicated some limitations: (i) 	Effluent water was not characterized which could include characterization of produced fines, dissolved elements in the effluent water. (ii) 	Coal characterization (coal rank and mineralogy etc.) was not conducted so that a correlation between the permeability variation and coal and fines characteristics could not be investigated. This is an important missing information which can help understand the root causes for the permeability variation. (iii) 	The effect of coal creep was not separated from that of fines migration on the permeability variation. So, it was difficult to analyze and conclusively demonstrate the impact on coal permeability of each mechanism. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate to what degree fines migration is responsible for coal permeability variation during water flow. A systematic physical and analytical modeling approach is proposed for this purpose. The approach includes designed water flow tests, characterization of coal samples, analysis of effluent water and analytical modeling of permeability damage. The results demonstrate that permeability is affected by fines migration during water flow in coal. A good correlation between the permeability variation and fines production is observed. The fines produced from coal are found to be mainly coal and clay. Analytical calculations of the interaction energy between the observed fines and coal surface suggest that clay fines are easier to be mobilized than coal fines. Bituminous coal fines appear to mobilize more easily than <b>anthracite</b> coal <b>fines.</b> The analytical tool predicts reasonably the observed permeability variation...|$|R
50|$|Bricks were {{originally}} made by hand, and that practice continues {{in developing countries}} and a few specialty suppliers.In a large industrial brickworks, clay is taken from the quarry, and then carried by conveyor belt or truck/lorry to the main factory, {{although it may be}} stockpiled outside before entering the machinery. When the clay enters the preparation plant (Clay Prep) it is crushed, and mixed with water and other additives which may include breeze, a very <b>fine</b> <b>anthracite</b> that aids firing. This process, which is also known as pugmilling, improves the consistency, firing qualities, texture, and colour of the brick. From here, the processed clay can be extruded into a continuous strip and cut with wires, or put into moulds or presses (also referred to as forming) to form the clay into its final shape. After the forming or cutting, the bricks must be dried, either in the open air, in drying sheds, or in special drying kilns. When the bricks have been dried, they must then be fired or 'burnt' in a kiln, to give them their final hardness and appearance.The brick manufacturing process was revolutionised in the mid nineteenth century with the development of automated brickmaking machines such as the Bradley & Craven Ltd ‘Stiff-Plastic Brickmaking Machine’.|$|R
