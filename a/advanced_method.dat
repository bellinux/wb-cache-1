The traditional method is Pulverized combustion (PC) which {{is used in the}} older units of oil shale-fired power plants in Estonia, while the more <b>advanced</b> <b>method</b> is Fluidized bed combustion (FBC), which is used in the Holcim cement factory in Dotternhausen, Germany, and was used in the Mishor Rotem power plant in Israel. The main FBC technologies are Bubbling fluidized bed combustion (BFBC) and Circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC).|$|E

25|$|The Iron Age {{brought a}} measure of {{prosperity}} to {{the people living in}} the area of the present-day Netherlands. Iron ore was available throughout the country, including bog iron extracted from the ore in peat bogs (moeras ijzererts) in the north, the natural iron-bearing balls found in the Veluwe and the red iron ore near the rivers in Brabant. Smiths travelled from small settlement to settlement with bronze and iron, fabricating tools on demand, including axes, knives, pins, arrowheads and swords. Some evidence even suggests the making of Damascus steel swords using an <b>advanced</b> <b>method</b> of forging that combined the flexibility of iron with the strength of steel.|$|E

30|$|Rationale: The present {{recommendation}} {{is based on}} post-cardiac arrest patients. A greater efficacy of <b>advanced</b> <b>methods</b> (“servo-controlled”) was constantly found, particularly during the maintenance phase. The benefit of <b>advanced</b> <b>methods</b> during the induction phase of TTM was however variable because it relied upon the initial temperature. The incidence of overcooling/overshooting was variable between <b>advanced</b> and basic <b>methods.</b> Our analysis included 3 randomized studies [165 – 167] and uncontrolled studies [168 – 171]. Regarding the neurological outcome, results were discordant: one study found a trend in favour of <b>advanced</b> <b>methods</b> [165], two studies were either negative [166] or positive (though cerebral performance category score was not reported) [167], and 4 studies gave variable results [168 – 171]. Overall, these <b>advanced</b> <b>methods</b> might help to optimize TTM, but their effect on survival with good neurological outcome was not established [40].|$|R

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 6th century, Pope Gregory I {{dispatched}} a mission under Augustine of Canterbury to convert the Anglo-Saxons, establish new sees and churches throughout their territories, and reassert papal authority over the native church. Gregory intended for Augustine to become the metropolitan bishop over all of southern Britain, including the existing dioceses under Welsh and Cornish control. Augustine met with British bishops in a series of conferencesknown as the Synod of Chesterthat attempted to assert his authority and to compel them to abandon aspects of their service that had fallen out of line with Roman practice. The Northumbrian cleric Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People is the only surviving account of these meetings: according to it, some of the clerics of the nearest British province met Augustine at a site on the border of the Kingdom of Kent that was known thereafter as Augustine's Oak. Augustine focused on seeking assistance for his work among the Saxons and reforming the Britons' obsolete method for calculating Easter; the clerics responded that they would need to confer with their people and await a larger assembly. Bede relates that the bishops particularly consulted a hermit on how to respond. He told them to respond based on Augustine's conduct: were he to rise to greet them, they would know him for a humble servant of Christ and should submit to his authority but, were he to remain seated, they would know him to be arrogant and prideful and should reject him. As it happened, Augustine did keep his seat, provoking outrage. In the negotiations that followed, he offered to allow the Britons to maintain all their native customs but three: they should adopt Rome's more <b>advanced</b> <b>method</b> of calculating the date of Easter, reform their baptismal ritual, and join the missionary efforts among the Saxons. The British clerics rejected all of these, as well as Augustine's authority over them. John Edward Lloyd argues that the primary reason for the British bishops' rejection of Augustine – and especially his call for them to join his missionary effort – was his claim to sovereignty over them, given that his see would be so deeply entwined with Anglo-Saxon Kent.|$|E

The one farthest from the Sun is Voyager 1, {{which is more}} than 100 AU distant and is moving at 3.6 AU per year. In comparison, Proxima Centauri, the closest star other than the Sun, is 267,000 AU distant. It will take Voyager 1 over 74,000 years to reach this distance. Vehicle designs using other techniques, such as nuclear pulse propulsion are {{likely to be able to}} reach the nearest star significantly faster. Another possibility that could allow for human interstellar spaceflight is to make use of time dilation, as this would make it possible for passengers in a fast-moving vehicle to travel further into the future while aging very little, in that their great speed slows down the rate of passage of on-board time. [...] However, attaining such high speeds would still require the use of some new, <b>advanced</b> <b>method</b> of propulsion.|$|E
2500|$|Through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, various {{methods to}} improve the dynamic range of mass-produced records {{involved}} highly advanced disc cutting equipment. These techniques, marketed, to name two, as the CBS DisComputer and Teldec Direct Metal Mastering, were used to reduce inner-groove distortion. RCA Victor introduced another system to reduce dynamic range and achieve a groove with less surface noise under the commercial name of Dynagroove. Two main elements were combined: another disk material with less surface noise in the groove and dynamic compression for masking background noise. Sometimes this was called [...] "diaphragming" [...] the source material and not favoured by some music lovers for its unnatural side effects. Both elements were reflected in the brandname of Dynagroove, described elsewhere in more detail. It also used the earlier <b>advanced</b> <b>method</b> of forward-looking control on groove spacing with respect to volume of sound and position on the disk. Lower recorded volume used closer spacing; higher recorded volume used wider spacing, especially with lower frequencies. Also, the higher track density at lower volumes enabled disk recordings to end {{farther away from the}} disk center than usual, helping to reduce endtrack distortion even further.|$|E

2500|$|The Degnan {{ransom note}} was first {{examined}} by the Chicago Crime Detection Laboratory, but they couldn't find any usable prints on the note. Captain Timothy O'Connor took the note to the FBI crime laboratory in Washington, D.C. on January 18, 1946 {{with the idea of}} enlisting the FBI's more sophisticated technology in finding any latent prints. The FBI subjected the note to the then <b>advanced</b> <b>method</b> of iodine fuming to raise latent prints. The process was similar in execution to today's polycyanoacrylate [...] "super glue" [...] fuming in which Cyanoacrylate is heated to a vapor. This vapor sticks to the skin oils on the friction ridges of a latent fingerprint. The older Ninhydrin method which is a liquid that is sprayed on paper to detect latent prints on paper is similar. The FBI were able to raise two prints which they photographed promptly because, unlike modern polycyanoacrylate, fuming prints revealed by the iodine process fade quickly. Captain O'Connor later testified at Heirens's sentencing hearing that he only saw two prints {{on the front of the}} note and did not mention the existence of any on the back.|$|E
