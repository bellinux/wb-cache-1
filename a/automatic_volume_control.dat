40|$|We study {{feedback}} control over erasure channels with packet-dropouts. To achieve robustness {{with respect to}} packet-dropouts, the controller transmits data packets containing plant input predictions, which minimize a finite horizon cost function. To reduce the data size of packets, we propose to adopt sparsity-promoting optimizations, namely, ell- 1 -ell- 2 and ell- 2 -constrained ell- 0 optimizations, for which efficient algorithms exist. We derive sufficient conditions on design parameters, which guarantee (practical) stability of the resulting {{feedback control}} systems {{when the number of}} consecutive packet-dropouts is bounded.

40|$|We {{provide an}} {{amendment}} to the first theorem of "Control Contraction Metrics: Convex and Intrinsic Criteria for Nonlinear Feedback Design" by Manchester & Slotine {{in the form of an}} additional technical condition required to show integrability of differential control signals. This technical condition is shown to be satisfied under the original assumptions if the input matrix is constant rank, and also if the strong conditions for a CCM hold. However a simple counterexample shows that if the input matrix drops rank, then the weaker conditions of the original theorem may not imply stabilizability of all trajectories. The remaining claims and illustrative examples of the paper are shown to remain valid with the new condition. Comment: Amendment to: I. R. Manchester, J. J. E.

40|$|The {{final version}} of this paper {{appeared}} in IEEE Transactions on <b>Automatic</b> <b>Control,</b> <b>Volume</b> 54, Issue 7, July 2009, pp. 1439 - 1449. This paper presents a new fundamental approach to modal participation analysis of linear time-invariant systems, leading to new insights and new formulas for modal participation factors. Modal participation factors were introduced over a quarter century ago as a way of measuring the relative participation of modes in states, and of states in modes, for linear time-invariant systems. Participation factors have proved their usefulness in the field of electric power systems and in other applications. However, in the current understanding, it is routinely taken for granted that the measure of participation of modes in states is identical to that for participation of states in modes. Here, a new analysis using averaging over an uncertain set of system initial conditions yields the conclusion that these quantities(participation of modes in states and participation of states in modes) should not be viewed as interchangeable. In fact, it is proposed that a new definition and calculation} replace the existing ones for state in mode participation factors, while the previously existing participation factors definition and formula should be retained but viewed only as mode in state participation factors. Examples are used throughout the paper to illustrate the issues addressed and results obtained. National Science Foundation, Office of Naval Research...|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to ARA and SCR-274-N receivers, all AN/ARC-5 receivers have <b>automatic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> and a modified tube complement. The AN/ARC-5 navigation receivers have terminals and a switch to connect a DU-series direction finding loop to the receiver, {{and have a}} special audio line for an MX-19/ARC-5 adapter to allow the receiver {{to serve as an}} LF/MF localizer for the Navy's short-lived AN/ARN-9 Air-Track (related to ZA, ZAX) instrument landing system. These two capabilities were rarely if ever utilized. Otherwise, equivalent receivers of all three systems can interchange as a unit.|$|E

50|$|In 1924 {{he became}} Hazeltine Corporation's first employee, and in 1925 {{created the first}} radio {{receiver}} with a diode <b>automatic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> that maintained a constant sound level while tuning to broadcasts of differing strengths. AM radio receivers incorporating this circuit came into use about 1930, {{and it has been}} included in every set since. He led the Hazeltine laboratory 1930-1939, and during this time received patents for 126 inventions {{on a wide range of}} work including circuits, test equipment, acoustics, antennas, transmission lines, methods of calculation for inductance of coils (included in all relevant textbooks since the mid-1930s), skin effect, coupled circuit theory, television scanning theory, and analysis and design of wide-band TV amplifiers.|$|E
50|$|A plate {{detector}} (or anode-bend detector) is {{a vacuum}} tube detector circuit used in A.M. radios, although {{the term is}} sometimes extended to transistor circuits that similarly rely upon distorted amplification to enhance {{one half of the}} received signal over the other. This circuit employs a tube with an indirectly heated cathode, typically a medium-mu triode, or a tetrode or pentode with a sharp cut-off control grid. Partial rectification of R.F. signals occurs in the plate of the detector tube if it is forced into its non-linear region at roughly the zero crossing point of the input signal. This differs from a grid-leak detector, which achieves rectification in the control grid. It also differs from the diode detector circuit commonly used to provide both R.F. rectification and <b>automatic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> (A.V.C.) bias to the R.F. amplifier tubes.|$|E
50|$|Automatic {{gain control}} (AGC), also called <b>automatic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> (AVC), is a {{closed-loop}} feedback regulating circuit, {{the purpose of}} which is to provide a controlled signal amplitude at its output, despite variation of the amplitude in the input signal. The average or peak output signal level is used to dynamically adjust the input-to-output gain to a suitable value, enabling the circuit to work satisfactorily with a greater range of input signal levels. It is used in most radio receivers to equalise the average volume (loudness) of different radio stations due to differences in received signal strength, as well as variations in a single station's radio signal due to fading. Without AGC the sound emitted from an AM radio receiver would vary to an extreme extent from a weak to a strong signal; the AGC effectively reduces the volume if the signal is strong and raises it when it is weaker.|$|E

The LX and LXE models feature self-cancelling turn signals, automatic rear pneumatic leveling system, rear suspension load pre-tensioner, air-adjustable damping on the front shocks that could be refilled with a standard tire pump connection, electronic cruise control, radio and cassette deck with LCD station display, volume and station selection controls on the handlebars, adjustment knob for the headlight, adjustable passenger floorboards, fore to aft top case adjustment for passenger comfort, adjustable handlebars and adjustable windshield. The radio is in a decorative housing that resembles a standard motorcycle fuel tank. The radio has an <b>automatic</b> <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> that raises and lowers the radio volume based on {{the speed of the}} motorcycle.

The radio antenna could be unscrewed and lowered so as not to interfere with the positioning of the weather cover, which was standard with all models.|$|E
