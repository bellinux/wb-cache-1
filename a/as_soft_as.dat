500|$|After Carey {{finished}} {{writing and}} producing the track alongside Williams, Dogg added his rap verse, and added some ulterior beats and components. Before taking the still-uncompleted song to the studio, Dogg described {{the song and}} beat [...] "The beat was just sick and it was bangin'. I was like, 'All right, give me that, M.C.' I took [...] down to my studio and flipped my style to it." [...] After slightly altering the song, as well as adding his verses, Dogg met with Carey once again for her approval on the song, [...] "When I played [...] for her, she was like, 'Oh, I love it!' I said, 'OK, give me a hug, baby.' She was just <b>as</b> <b>soft</b> <b>as</b> a cotton swab! Lord have mercy! Jesus, M.C.! What I wouldn't ... Let me stop." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the area}} {{northwest}} of Breslau, {{the absence of}} steep hills made observation of an approaching enemy easy, and the relative flatness limited hiding maneuvers. The presence of alluvial soils guaranteed relatively soft ground – not <b>as</b> <b>soft</b> <b>as</b> Frederick would face at Kunersdorf in 1758, but soft enough to provide the occasional natural bogs to bar the passage of troops in some locations, or to muffle the sound of marching and horses' hooves. The area around Leuthen included several hamlets and villages: principally, Nippern, about [...] north; Frobelwitz, also to the north, about halfway between Leuthen and Nippern; Gahla, [...] to the southeast; and Lissa, [...] to the east. A roadway connected the villages of Borna, Leuthen, and Lissa with Breslau, across the Oder river and its tributaries.|$|E

2500|$|The {{demand for}} heavier fabric {{was met by}} a {{domestic}} industry based around Lancashire that produced fustian, a cloth with flax warp and cotton weft. [...] Flax {{was used for the}} warp because wheel-spun cotton did not have sufficient strength, but the resulting blend was not <b>as</b> <b>soft</b> <b>as</b> 100% cotton and was more difficult to sew.|$|E
2500|$|Leather gloves {{have been}} worn by people for {{thousands}} of years. The unique properties of leather allow for both a comfortable fit and useful grip for the wearer. The grain present on the leather and the pores present in the leather gives the gloves the unique ability to assist the wearer as they grip an object. <b>As</b> <b>soft</b> <b>as</b> a leather glove may be, its pores and grain provide a level of friction when [...] "gripped" [...] against an item or surface.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1933, Bush {{was hired}} as {{the manager of the}} Minneapolis Millers, the team he had coached in 1932. [...] He {{remained}} with the Millers from 1934 to 1938 and won pennants in 1934 and 1935. [...] Ted Williams played for the Millers in 1938, saw his batting average jump 75 points over the prior year, and later credited Bush with some of his success. After learning that Bush had died, Williams said: [...] "I've been in the game for 36 years and nobody has any closer affection to my heart than Ownie." [...] He noted that Bush was as [...] "fiery as a man could be...a man who tried to be tough but was <b>as</b> <b>soft</b> <b>as</b> a grape." ...|$|E
50|$|Philippine hanging parrots {{are usually}} {{encountered}} {{alone or in}} pairs, rarely in small groups.

2500|$|Music {{critics were}} {{generally}} harsh in their assessment of his piano playing. Critic Lewis Funke wrote after the Carnegie Hall concert, Liberace's music [...] "must be served {{with all the}} available tricks, as loud as possible, <b>as</b> <b>soft</b> <b>as</b> possible, and as sentimental as possible. It's almost all showmanship topped by whipped cream and cherries." [...] Even worse was his lack of reverence and fealty to the great composers. [...] "Liberace recreates—if that is the word—each composition in his own image. When it is too difficult, he simplifies it. When it is too simple, he complicates it". His sloppy technique included [...] "slackness of rhythms, wrong tempos, distorted phrasing, an excess of prettification and sentimentality, a failure to stick to what the composer has written".|$|E

5|$|The breed {{has many}} {{similarities}} with the Picardy Spaniel {{due to the}} two breeds' recent history. The Blue Spaniel is described <b>as</b> being <b>softer,</b> <b>as</b> well as the obvious difference in coat color. The Picardy has a brown coat whereas the Blue Picardy has a black and grey coat, which was brought into the breed {{by the introduction of}} English Setter blood. Similar in the modern era due to the close similarities of the two different breed standards. In addition, the Blue Picardy is a little faster, and has a slightly finer nose.|$|R

In an operational definition of soft and hard processes one finds that at presently analyzed scales there is an interplay of soft and hard processes.
