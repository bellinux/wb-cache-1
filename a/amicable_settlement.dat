40|$|During {{and since}} the Orange Revolution, {{problems}} of privatization have become unusually acrimonious in Ukraine. The privatization process, which began in 1992, became a foundation for generating the oligarchic big capital that provides political and financial support for the old [preâOrange Revolution] authorities. This article takes a retrospective look at the transformation of privatization from a reform process into a tool for the targeted transfer of state property, at low prices, to the ownership of specific business groups close to the old authoritiesâa practice that {{became one of the}} points of contention in Ukrainian society. After the Orange Revolution, privatization, which was interwoven into the canvas of political struggle, became "shock" reprivatizationâthe forced return of previously privatized assets to state ownership for resale. This reinforced the negative perception of denationalization on the part of society and the new authorities. Development of the state sector became the new authorities' dominant economic policy; privatization acquired a simplified largely fiscal role. Only after the negative consequences of the reprivatization policies pursued after the Orange Revolution were clearly demonstrated did the new authorities start to fundamentally revise their positions. In this light, it is interesting to analyze the positions and actions of key government and political figures in Ukraine during 2005 - 6. In so doing, the new authorities' desire to switch to a policy of <b>amicable</b> <b>settlements,</b> and to set up an efficient privatization process in 2006, are particularly important. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Unlike {{litigation}} and arbitration, mediation {{is a more}} informal way to settle disputes. The process has been considered to be quick, cheap and interest-based and {{it is said to}} promote <b>amicable</b> <b>settlements.</b> Yet mediation is not commonly used as a dispute resolution method in Sweden today. However, mediation as a dispute resolution method is promoted by the EU institutions and the European Parliament and the Council has adopted a directive which will secure that the EU citizens, in some cases, will have the possibility to choose extrajudicial mediation as a dispute resolution method. Until now, it has not been possible for parties to immediately seek enforcement of the content of a Swedish extrajudicial mediation settlement agreement. However, the directive will also ensure that the EU Member States provide the EU citizens with such enforcement possibilities. According to the wording of the directive, the request of enforcement will require all parties' explicit consent. This means, that if such consent is not given, the content of the agreement cannot be made enforceable. The uncertainty whether such consent will begiven in {{the end of the process}} or not may contribute to people waiving to initiate a mediation process because the actual outcome of the process could be difficult to predict. For the mediation process to be considered as an equivalent way to settle disputes to the e. g. litigation proceeding, it is necessary that the parties also experience the results of the processes as equivalent. The requirement of consent is not totally abandoned in the proposed Swedish Mediation Act by which the directive shall be implemented. Instead of choosing the wording of the directive, there are other perspectives on the matter of enforcement which the Swedish legislature perhaps could be inspired by when implementing the directive...|$|R
40|$|This book is {{focussed}} on investigating how {{a proper}} implementation of forensic accounting tools {{could serve as}} a means and channel whereby such techniques as valuations, equitable distribution and evidence could be employed in avoiding unnecessary break ups and emotional breakdowns. Through the exploration of options which are available to marital couples considering separation or divorce during periods of crises, the book aims to emphasise the theme that a break from the relationship may be the step required to avert a break-up. The role of forensic accounting in facilitating an amicable process during such a break - which could result in the possible restoration of relationships involved during such crucial stage also constitutes a recurring theme of the book. It is a well known fact that financial problems constitute the source of break-downs in many relationships. Whilst other factors may contribute to failures in relationships and whilst some couples may have finalised their intentions and require very little assistance in getting through such painstaking processes, others may have their decisions influenced by court procedures, counselling sessions and the proper application of equitable distribution procedures – such equitable distribution procedure being considered a preferred technique in resolving marital asset distributions than the community property concept. Further this book highlights factors which need to be taken into consideration – not only in averting unnecessary break-ups, but also in facilitating harmonious and <b>amicable</b> <b>settlements</b> which may eventually pave the way for reconciliation, as well as restoration of broken down relationships. Whilst planning of marital asset distribution should not constitute the focus of any marriage, planning when the need arises may serve not only as a channel whereby a relationship can be restored eventually, but as a temporary means of weathering the storms during the difficult times in the relationship. ...|$|R

Recover your old ground, and your old tranquillity; try it; I am persuaded the Americans will compromise with you.

60|$|The real {{practical}} {{decision of}} affairs, to whichever {{may be given}} the legal authority, will greatly depend, as it even now does, upon comparative qualifications. The mere {{fact that he is}} usually the eldest, will in most cases give the preponderance to the man; at least until they both attain a time of life at which the difference in their years is of no importance. There will naturally also be a more potential voice on the side, whichever it is, that brings the means of support. Inequality from this source does not depend on the law of marriage, but on the general conditions of human society, as now constituted. The influence of mental superiority, either general or special, and of superior decision of character, will necessarily tell for much. It always does so at present. And this fact shows how little foundation there is for the apprehension that the powers and responsibilities of partners in life (as of partners in business), cannot be satisfactorily apportioned by agreement between themselves. They always are so apportioned, except in cases in which the marriage institution is a failure. Things never come to an issue of downright power on one side, and obedience on the other, except where the connexion altogether has been a mistake, {{and it would be a}} blessing to both parties to be relieved from it. Some may say that the very thing by which an <b>amicable</b> <b>settlement</b> of differences becomes possible, is the power of legal compulsion known to be in reserve; as people submit to an arbitration because there is a court of law in the background, which they know that they can be forced to obey. But to make the cases parallel, we must suppose that the rule of the court of law was, not to try the cause, but to give judgment always for the same side, suppose the defendant. If so, the amenability to it would be a motive with the plaintiff to agree to almost any arbitration, but it would be just the reverse with the defendant. The despotic power which the law gives to the husband may be a reason to make the wife assent to any compromise by which power is practically shared between the two, but it cannot be the reason why the husband does. That there is always among decently conducted people a practical compromise, though one of them at least is under no physical or moral necessity of making it, shows that the natural motives which lead to a voluntary adjustment of the united life of two persons in a manner acceptable to both, do on the whole, except in unfavourable cases, prevail. The matter is certainly not improved by laying down as an ordinance of law, that the superstructure of free government shall be raised upon a legal basis of despotism on one side and subjection on the other, and that every concession which the despot makes may, at his mere pleasure, and without any warning, be recalled. Besides that no freedom is worth much when held on so precarious a tenure, its conditions are not likely to be the most equitable when the law throws so prodigious a weight into one scale; when the adjustment rests between two persons one of whom is declared to be entitled to everything, the other not only entitled to nothing except during the good pleasure of the first, but under the strongest moral and religious obligation not to rebel under any excess of oppression.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the scarce {{diffusion}} of the ADR practice in Europe. Regarding the arbitration, the reason lies in {{the high costs of}} this procedure, while respect to the other out-of-Court procedures, like mediation, there is a large mistrust among lawyers, due to lack of training to cooperation and dialogue. Recently a EU Directive has pushed towards mediation in civil and commercial lawsuits, where cross-border cases are particularly complex due to different national laws and practical matters like costs or language. National legislators have used this occasion to introduce a general discipline of mediation, applicable to domestic disputes as well. So most lawyers are called to abandon their adversarial approach in order to prepare for a cooperative negotiation. The author examines the numerous aspects on which a lawyer can play his role in every step of a mediation proceeding, and bring the client to an <b>amicable</b> satisfactory <b>settlement...</b>|$|R

How can courts curb contingency costs of matrimonial litigation when a closely held company is involved? – particularly where such closely held companies' profits can be steered towards greater profits if these companies are encouraged to continue to run (as well as alleviate financial problems which may initially have contributed to financial and marital problems). Given recent statistics which indicate a 50 : 50 success rate in marriages, should courts not have a role in assisting to alleviate and reduce tax burdens which are peculiar to companies run by couples – where it can easily be proven that these were the sources of financial and eventually, marital tensions? What role could forensic accountants also play in providing financial, valuation and business advice to couples experiencing such business difficulties – and who lack the required access to funds or expertise aimed at restoring the viabililty of their businesses. Would such expertise and advice restore their businesses – and eventully their relationships? It is a well known fact that financial problems constitute the source of break-downs in many relationships.

Theoretical tools are applied in the thesis to scrutinize the prospects of Gwadar as a hub port, arguing its geopolitical environment, its technical aspects and how it would channel Chinese trade yielding benefits to the economy of Pakistan. China is the main supporter of this mega project, increasing energy demand in china, its oil policies, and strategies for the development of its western part and its growing economy is discussed in order to find out the importance of Gwadar port for china and the expected Chinese trade flow through this port. The port is compared for transshipment, transit trade, infrastructure, facilities provided etc with the other ports of the region. Each of the port is discussed individually first and then the comparison of these ports is presented. The interests in the region surrounding Gwadar port by various regional players along with the super powers are discussed to find out the geo-strategic imperatives surrounding and affecting Gwadar port. The focus is on the identification of these interests in terms of security or economic compulsions. This interrelation is then used to suggest policy guidelines for Islamabad. To test the hypothesis both primary and secondary data is used. Each chapter is comprised of two parts. The first part is based on secondary data while the second part is based on the main findings from primary data. Primary data is collected from civil servants and businesspeople to reach to the depth of the problem and suggest the solutions for it. A self administered questionnaire is used to collect primary data. The cross tab, chi square and tabulation techniques under the SPSS programme are used for the analysis of primary data. The study finds that Gwadar Port can generate necessary resources for developing required infrastructure which is pre requisite for fully functional and successful port and which would in turn be a catalyst for the economic revival of Pakistan provided a stable, congenial and secured environment is in place, and that is only possible through regional co-operation and <b>amicable</b> <b>settlements</b> of all domestic and international political and diplomatic issues...|$|R
