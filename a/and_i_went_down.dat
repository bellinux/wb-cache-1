6000|$|... "They did, Jack. First Codfish tried it, {{and then}} Brown {{put out his}} foot <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down,</b> and Martell at once pounced on me." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{got through}} {{the early part of}} the season better than we feared, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> in great elation to spend Christmas on the goose-green.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{my father}} {{recovered}} from his wound, {{and so did}} the soldier who saved me, and as soon as my father was able to travel, he <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to the coast and came home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So we {{decides to}} pull out, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> to Mrs. Trotter's hotel {{to pay her}} last week's salary and say {{farewell}} and get her check for the $2,000.|$|R
60|$|When Lankin <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> {{stairs to}} breakfast, we find, {{if not the}} best, at least the most {{conspicuous}} places in occupation of Lady Kicklebury's party, and the hulking London footman making a darkness in the cabin, as he stoops through it bearing cups and plates to his employers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Like to {{make you}} acquainted with Jedge Abner Parkinson, Mr. Wetherell, and Jim Irving. Jim's the sheriff of Truro County, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> guess the jedge don't need any {{recommendation}} as a lawyer from me. You won't mind stayin' awhile with the jedge while Jim <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> town with the team? You're both literary folks." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{separated}} a {{few moments}} later, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to my state-room. I found Guest busy writing in a pocket-book, seated {{on the edge of}} his bunk. I told him of my conversation with Mr. de Valentin.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay. My venture was South. Farther South {{than any}} man has fared, Hugh <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> with Witta and his heathen.' He jerked the tall sword forward, and leaned on it with both hands; but his eyes looked long past them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, I predict," [...] I replied calmly. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> {{the steps}} {{and out of the}} gate, he looking after me. Before I had turned the corner of Freshwater Lane, he was in the seat, and fanning himself with his hat.|$|E
6000|$|To {{have to say}} no to my betters is one of {{the hardest}} duties I have, but I'm sure we must not publish your verses, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> on my knees before cutting my victim's head off, and say, 'Madam, you know how <b>I</b> respect <b>and</b> regard you, Browning's wife and Penini's mother; <b>and</b> for what <b>I</b> am going to do I most humbly ask your pardon.' ...|$|R
60|$|She hastily {{returned}} to her room, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> on <b>down</b> stairs. In the hall, the servant was waiting for me, with a letter in his hand.|$|R
60|$|Now I {{had been}} {{thinking}} all the afternoon that he was better, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had <b>gone</b> <b>down</b> to dinner cheered. I turned into the doorway, and told Fulk to come and see.|$|R
60|$|At {{last the}} day came for them to arrive, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to the train to meet them with papa and Polly. I {{proposed}} this myself, as it was much less embarrassing to meet in all that bustle and confusion than in the quiet of our hall.|$|E
60|$|But now I made {{a second}} dive, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> beautifully. I made a grab {{at the first}} thing my hand touched. It was a purple knob of coral. But it stuck tight to its mother-rock, and I {{was ready to go}} up before it was ready to come loose, and so I went up without it.|$|E
6000|$|The noise not leavin off, I {{laid down}} my pipe, and I {{took up a}} candle, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> and opened the door. I looked out into the street; but nothin could I see, and nothin was I aware of, until I turned round quick, because some creetur run between my legs into the passage. There was Mr. Chops! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some number sixes, I suppose," [...] said Mr. Amethyst, {{taking a}} couple from {{the apex of}} a small pyramid that lay piled on the shelf. [...] "These are {{about the size of}} the Duchess of Billingsgate's, but they are in finer condition. The fact is, her Grace permits her two children, the Marquis of Smithfield and the Duke of St. Giles,--two sweet pretty boys, my lord,--to use them as marbles in their games. Pearls require some attention, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> there {{regularly}} twice a week to clean them. Perhaps your lordship would like some ropes of pearls?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish we were. We {{came back}} last week <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> {{straight}} <b>down</b> to the Cedars--Tom's place at Melton, you know. I don't think I've been warm since I landed in England. Just now I'm nearly frozen to death." ...|$|R
6000|$|Father was {{composed}} but tense. He went about his duties with solemn resignation, and, {{an hour or}} two later, he said to me, [...] "You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> select a burial lot, a place for your mother and me." ...|$|R
60|$|We agreed, {{without any}} more consultation, {{that we would}} both go, and that Dora was a little Impostor, who feigned to be rather unwell, because she liked to be petted. She was greatly pleased, and very merry; and we four, that is to say, my aunt, Mr. Dick, Traddles, <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to Canterbury by the Dover mail that night.|$|E
60|$|With {{the fear}} that we would escape them, the creatures redoubled their efforts to pull me down, and though the ground about me was piled high with their dead and dying comrades, they succeeded at last in {{overwhelming}} me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> beneath them {{for the second time}} that day, and once again felt those awful sucking lips against my flesh.|$|E
6000|$|... "It doesn't grow here, father." [...] Then {{her face}} brightened, and she added: [...] "Yes, it does, though. The {{day that we}} outspanned in this camp mother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> {{to the river and}} walked to that kind of island beyond the dry donga to get some flowers that grow on the wet ground. I saw lots of Cape {{gooseberries}} there, all quite ripe." ...|$|E
60|$|CATHLEEN. Ah, no, not that. A sad resolve wakes in me. I {{have heard}} A sound of wailing in {{unnumbered}} hovels, <b>And</b> <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>down,</b> down--I know not where-- Pray for all {{men and women}} mad from famine; Pray, you good neighbours.|$|R
60|$|AFTER {{taking off}} my riding-habit, and cooling my hot face with eau-de-cologne <b>and</b> water, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> {{to the room}} which we called the morning-room. The piano there was my {{favorite}} instrument <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had the idea of trying what music would do toward helping me to compose myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Cantrip's {{grandmother}} was,--I don't {{quite know}} what she was, but something to us. I know I've got {{a picture of her}} at Popplecourt. Lady Cantrip wanted to ask me something about it, <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down.</b> <b>I</b> was so glad to make acquaintance with your sister." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not she; {{she never}} budged!"--and Mrs. Beale's flush, to Maisie's vision, deepened. [...] "She moped there--she didn't {{so much as}} come out to me; and when I sent to invite her she simply {{declined}} to appear. She said she wanted nothing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> alone. But when I came up, fortunately a little primed"--and Mrs. Beale smiled a fine smile of battle--"she WAS in the field!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I knew no harm of Bonaparte {{and plenty}} of the Squire, [...] And for to fight the Frenchman I did not much desire; [...] But I did bash their baggonets because they came arrayed [...] To {{straighten}} out the crooked road an English drunkard made, [...] Where you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> the lane with ale-mugs in our hands, [...] The night we went to Glastonbury by way of Goodwin Sands.|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} of the next day, my old nurse <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to Gravesend. We found the ship in the river, surrounded by a crowd of boats; a favourable wind blowing; the signal for sailing at her mast-head. I hired a boat directly, and we put off to her; and getting through the little vortex of confusion of which she was the centre, went on board.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} am," [...] replied Piny. [...] "He is my {{very own}} cousin. I've {{never seen him}} because he never ventures up where <b>I</b> live <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>go</b> <b>down</b> where he spends the winter, but {{all members of the}} Grosbeak family are cousins." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who will <b>go</b> <b>down</b> over Lewthwaite Crag, {{and see if}} {{that boy}} is alive? Oh that I were twenty years younger, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would <b>go</b> <b>down</b> myself!" [...] And so he would have done, {{as well as any}} sweep in the county. Then he said - ...|$|R
6000|$|Ah, no, not that. [...] But I {{have come}} to a strange thought. I have heard [...] A sound of wailing in {{unnumbered}} hovels, [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>down,</b> down--I know not where-- [...] Pray for all men and women mad from famine; [...] Pray, you good neighbours.|$|R
60|$|So we did--with hands which shook so, that {{we hardly}} {{knew what we}} were about. The lot fell to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down.</b> The water was so muddy I could not see anything, but I felt around among the hoop poles, and {{presently}} grasped a limp wrist which gave me no response--and if it had I should not have known it, I let it go with such a frightened suddenness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't dadda the foxiest old thing!" [...] said Billie delightedly. [...] "Imagine him {{standing}} {{there that day}} in the garden, kidding us along like that! I tell you, when they brought me his card last night after the first act <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to take a slant at this Lord Marshmoreton and found dadda hanging round the stage door, you could have knocked me over with a whisk-broom." ...|$|E
6000|$|In operas and romances {{one goes}} {{from such a}} parting in a splendid dignity of gloom. But I am no hero, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> the big {{staircase}} of Tarvrille's house the empty shuck of an abandoned desire. I was acutely ashamed of my recent tears. In {{the centre of the}} hall was a marble figure swathed about with yellow muslin. [...] "On account of the flies," [...] I said, breaking our silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] Hilda said decidedly, [...] "then I shall {{take the}} matter {{into my own}} hands, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>go</b> <b>down</b> to Rochester to-morrow and see if these people have a barge ready built. I don't know whether they are the sort of things people keep in stock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{knows you}} are here," [...] said he to Madame de Lescure, [...] "and {{you are to}} go into him alone. Marie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>go</b> <b>down</b> stairs until he sends for us. Be {{tranquil}} as you can, while you are with him; you will find him as calm as ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, except Lapham himself, now <b>and</b> then. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> once {{or twice}} to see him. He hasn't given himself any {{vacation}} this summer; he has such a passion for his business that I fancy he finds it hard being away from it at any time, and he's made his new house an excuse for staying." ...|$|R
