5|$|Balcer and Wolf {{conceived}} Law & Order: Criminal Intent as {{a police}} procedural crime drama that follows a distinct division of the New York City Police Department: the 'Major Case Squad', and its investigations in to high-profile murder cases, such as those involving VIPs, local government officials and employees, and people working in the financial industry and the arts and entertainment world. Unlike the other series in the Law & Order franchise, Law & Order: Criminal Intent gives significant attention to the actions <b>and</b> <b>motives</b> of the criminals, rather than primarily focusing on the police investigation and trial prosecution. Episodes do not contain trials, and end in confessions rather than plea bargains or verdicts.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} contemporary, or near-contemporary, {{sources of information}} about the reign of Richard III. These include the Croyland Chronicle, Commines' Mémoires, the report of Dominic Mancini, the Paston Letters, the Chronicles of Robert Fabyan and numerous court and official records, including a few letters by Richard himself. However, the debate about Richard's true character <b>and</b> <b>motives</b> continues, both because of the subjectivity of many of the written sources, reflecting the generally partisan nature of writers of this period, and {{because of the fact that}} none was written by men with an intimate knowledge of Richard, even if they had met him in person.|$|E

5|$|The {{story is}} set in Persia during the 9th century AD, and begins with the Prince narrating to an unseen {{listener}} about his adventures. The Prince and the army of his father Shahraman are passing through India to visit the Sultan of Azad. The Vizier of a local Maharaja, wanting to prevent his death using a substance known as the Sands of Time, entices them into attacking the Maharaja's palace, where the Sands are stored. During the fight, the Prince loots an artefact called the Dagger of Time, and the Maharaja's daughter Farah is taken {{as a gift for}} the Sultan of Azad. Visiting Azad, the Vizier tricks the Prince into releasing the Sands, turning everyone but the Prince, the Vizier and Farah (protected by the Dagger, a staff and an amulet respectively) into sand creatures. The Vizier attempts to seize the Dagger from the Prince, but he escapes and eventually allies with Farah to undo the damage he has caused and prevent the Sands from covering the world, even though he has doubts about her loyalties <b>and</b> <b>motives.</b>|$|E

40|$|An updated {{literature}} review was conducted and a meta-analysis {{was performed to}} investigate the relationship between age <b>and</b> work-related <b>motives.</b> Building on theorizing in life span psychology, we hypothesized the existence of age-related differences in work-related motives. Specifically, we proposed an age-related increase in the strength of security <b>and</b> social <b>motives,</b> <b>and</b> an age-related decrease in the strength of growth motives. To investigate life span developmental theory predictions about age-related differences in control strategies, we also {{examined the relationship between}} age and intrinsic <b>and</b> extrinsic <b>motives.</b> Consistent with our predictions, meta-analytic results showed a significant positive relationship between age <b>and</b> intrinsic <b>motives,</b> <b>and</b> a significant negative relationship between age and strength of growth <b>and</b> extrinsic <b>motives.</b> The predicted positive relation between age and strength of social <b>and</b> security <b>motives</b> was only found among certain subgroups.

The paper integrates different factors used in the sponsorship literature and other academic articles in the field of marketing into a conceptual model.

The model attempts to explain the relationship between fit <b>and</b> <b>motive</b> articulation <b>and</b> sponsorship response. The results of the conducted research suggest that the relationship between fit <b>and</b> <b>motive</b> articulation <b>and</b> sponsorship response is moderated by self-congruence and frequency of use and mediated by corporate ability, corporate social responsibility and sponsorship attitude...|$|R

An example is Isaac Asimov's The Caves of Steel and its sequels, set in a world thousands of years in the future and presenting the Robot detective R. Daneel Olivaw. An allied genre is the Fantasy Mystery, a detective mystery set in a world of fantasy - such as the Lord Darcy mysteries taking place in a world where magic works, or The Idylls of the Queen set in the mythical King Arthur's court.|$|E
