While competitive sets used {{nut and bolt}} fasteners, the Lionel set employed round-head aircraft rivets retained with rubber grommets, {{eliminating the need for}} tools. The structural elements were hollow beams of square cross section made from folded and quite thin sheet aluminum, as a consequence subject to destruction if stepped upon. A more substantial folded <b>aluminum</b> <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> was used to form the foundation of most constructions, and additional circular plates could be used to construct larger wheels or pivots.

While innovative, the lack of general purpose beam members with lots of holes limited the adaptability of the set to complex constructions.

Angled optical fiber tips {{are used in}} applications such as optical sensing and remote laser surgery, {{where they can be}} used to control the angle of light leaving the fiber or direct it to the side. This allows for greater control and allows areas to be reached that otherwise could not. Optical fibers were produced with tip angles of 45 deg using a Perspex mounting block with an <b>aluminum</b> <b>base</b> <b>plate.</b> The dispersion of light leaving the tip was tested using a blue (470 nm) LED. The angle imposed an angular shift on the light diffracting out of the tip of approximately 30 deg. Additionally, some light reflected from the tip surface to diffract at 90 deg through the side of the fiber. These observations are consistent with theory and those seen by other studies, validating the method. The method was simple to perform and does not require advanced manufacturing tools. The method is suitable for producing small quantities of angle-tipped optical fibers for research applications...|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the General Support Technology Program of the European Space Agency (ESA), a compact dedicated confocal laser scanning microscope has been developed for 3 D fluorescence imaging of biological samples. The microscope permits normal confocal mode operation with excitation at 488 nm and fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) with excitation at 630 nm and a time resolution of 200 ps. Each fluorescence signal is detected by a dedicated photomultiplier tube. Proper optical signal separation and filtering is performed by a set of optical filters and dichroics. The software and hardware further include the specific imaging modes allowing for fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP). In addition to this dual wavelength fluorescence imaging mode, the microscope includes transmission imaging capabilities via differential imaging contrast (DIC). Both fluorescence and DIC imaging can be acquired simultaneously. The source for the DIC is a near infrared LED. This choice permits the decoupling of DIC and fluorescence signals by a dichroic cold mirror. The opto-mechanical assembly is constructed on the two sides of a rigid 16 mm thick <b>aluminum</b> <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> of dimensions 389 mm by 575. 5 mm.

40|$|Laboratory {{apparatus}} {{is depicted}} {{that is a}} chamber for aerosol deposition of bioparticles on surfaces of test coupons. It is designed for primary use in inoculating both flat and three-dimensional objects with approximately reproducible, uniform dispersions of bacterial spores of the genus Bacillus so that the objects {{could be used as}} standards for removal of the spores by quantitative surface sampling and/or cleaning processes. The apparatus is also designed for deposition of particles other than bacterial spores, including fungal spores, viruses, bacteriophages, and standard micron-sized beads. The novelty of the apparatus lies in the combination of a controllable nebulization system with a settling chamber large enough to contain a significant number of test coupons. Several companies market other nebulizer systems, but none are known to include chambers for deposition of bioparticles to mimic the natural fallout of bioparticles. The nebulization system is an expanded and improved version of commercially available aerosol generators that include nebulizers and drying columns. In comparison with a typical commercial aerosol generator, this system includes additional, higher-resolution flowmeters and an additional pressure regulator. Also, unlike a typical commercial aerosol generator, it includes stopcocks for separately controlling flows of gases to the nebulizer and drying column. To maximize the degree of uniformity of dispersion of bioaerosol, the chamber is shaped as an axisymmetrical cylinder and the aerosol generator is positioned centrally within the chamber and aimed upward like a fountain. In order to minimize electric charge associated with the aerosol particles, the drying column is made of aluminum, the drying column is in direct contact with an <b>aluminum</b> <b>base</b> <b>plate,</b> and three equally spaced Po- 210 antistatic strips are located at the exit end of the drying column. The sides and top of the chamber are made of an acrylic polymer; to prevent accumulation of electric charge on them, they are spray-coated with an anti-static material. During use, the base plate and the sides and top of the chamber are grounded as a further measure to minimize the buildup of electric charge...|$|E

Cellular structure materials, and particularly open-cell metal foams, have been proposed as possible substitutes for traditional finned surfaces in electronics cooling applications. This article presents the heat transfer and pressure drops measurements obtained during air flow through an aluminum foam, which has 40 pores per inch with 0. 63 mm pore diameter. The specimen has been inserted in a new open-circuit type wind channel with a rectangular cross-section that has recently been built at the Department of Fisica Tecnica of the University of Padova.

Laser impact welding (LIW) {{is a novel}} welding {{technique}} which uses laser induced shock waves to obtain the solid-state and metallurgical bonding between flyer and <b>base</b> <b>plates,</b> and can be applied in welding of dissimilar metal plates in micron level. In this paper, experimental study is conducted with titanium as the flyer plate and <b>aluminum</b> as the <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> under different laser energies and laser spot diameters. Besides, the microstructure and mechanical properties of the welding joints are also investigated. The wavy interface is observed by metallographic investigation {{which is similar to}} explosive welding and electromagnetic pulse welding. Moreover, the micro-hardness taken from the interface region shows an obvious improvement compared with the base metal. It is also found that laser shock welding results in fine grained structure of titanium on the weld interface. In conclusion, laser shock welding can not only improve the material microstructure of weld interface, but also avoid the heat affected zone and formation of intermetallic phase during dissimilar metal welding.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{setup is}} designed to simulate the heat dissipated by electronic devices and to test the effects of nanostructured plates in enhancing the heat removal performance of jet impingement systems in such cooling applications under boiling conditions. Prior experiments conducted in single phase have shown that such different surface morphologies are effective in enhancing the heat transfer performance of jet impingement cooling applications. In this paper, results of the most recent experiments conducted using multiphase jet impingement cooling system will be presented. Distilled water is propelled into four microtubes of diameter 500 µm that provide the impinging jets to the surface. Simulation of the heat generated by miniature electronic devices is simulated through four aluminum cartridge heaters of 6. 25 mm in diameter and 31. 75 mm in length placed inside an <b>aluminum</b> <b>base.</b> Nanostructured <b>plates</b> of size 35 mmx 30 mm and different surface morphologies are placed {{on the surface of the}} base and two thermocouples are placed to the surface of the heating base and the base is submerged into deionized water.

Effects of nanostructured plates of different surface morphologies on boiling heat transfer performance of the system are studied. Three nanostructured plates featuring Si nanowires of diameter 850 nm and of three different lengths, 900 nm, 1800 nm and 3200 nm respectively, which are etched through single crystal p-type silicon wafers using metal assisted chemical etching (MaCE), are utilized to enhance the pool boiling heat transfer. A plain surface Si plate is used as the control sample. C onstant heat flux is provided to the liquid within the pool {{on the surface of}} the <b>aluminum</b> <b>base</b> through the <b>plate</b> by boiling heat transfer. Existence of wall superheat gave rise to forming of vapor bubbles near the boiling temperature of the fluid, namely DI-Water. Bubbles emerged from the nanostructured plate along with the phase change. Nucleate boiling {{on the surface of the}} plate, bubble formation and bubble motion inside the pool created a heat removal mechanism from the heated surface to the liquid pool. The surface temperature at boiling inception is found to be 104 ºC for plain surface Si control sample, whereas it decreased to near 100 ºC for all the cases where a nanostructured plate was present. Due the enhancement in boiling heat transfer coefficients, this study proves the ability of nanostructure d plates in improving the performance of the cooling system...|$|R

However, it {{is related to the}} characteristics of Lamb waves that selecting mode of guided waves and estimating the detecting range. Therefore, this paper studies the propagation characteristics of Lamb waves, including directivity of sound field, multi-mode and dispersion. This paper mainly studied on the Lamb wave characteristics of the 1 mm-thick <b>aluminum</b> <b>plate</b> <b>based</b> on the finite element method. Results show that: A 0 and S 0 modes, which are only detected in the plate, have a strong directivity of sound field when the excitation frequency is in the range of 0. 08 MHz to 1 MHz. There is only A 0 mode in aluminum plate when the excitation frequency is lesser than 0. 188 MHz. When the excitation frequency is in the range of 0. 45 MHz to 0. 64 MHz, the displacement amplitude of the S 0 mode is gradually increasing. The displacement amplitude of the A 0 mode is minimum, while it is larger in the S 0 mode when the excitation frequency is 0. 64 MHz. The results of this paper provide a basis for selecting the best excitation frequency and mode of guided waves, which have the promising application prospect in quickly and accurately nondestructive testing.
