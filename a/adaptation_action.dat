40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the success of}} small-scale farming livelihoods in adapting to climate variability and change. We represent <b>adaptation</b> <b>actions</b> as choices within a response space that includes coping but also longer-term <b>adaptation</b> <b>actions,</b> and define success as those actions which promote system resilience, promote legitimate institutional change, and hence generate and sustain collective action. We explore data on social responses from four regions across South Africa and Mozambique facing a variety of climate risks. The analysis suggests that some collective <b>adaptation</b> <b>actions</b> enhance livelihood resilience to climate change and variability but others have negative spillover effects to other scales. Any assessment of successful adaptation is, however, constrained by the scale of analysis {{in terms of the}} temporal and spatial boundaries on the system being investigated. In addition, the diversity of mechanisms by which rural communities in southern Africa adapt to risks suggests that external interventions to assist adaptation will need {{to be sensitive to the}} location-specific nature of adaptation...|$|R

Dynamic software adaptation involves both {{the integration of}} new, previously unanticipated features and the update of existing features without requiring system downtime. Software adaptations must often be time-bounded, e. g., due to mobility constraints. Inconsistent or inaccurate behaviour may result from an adaptation that does not complete within specified time constraints. Service providers must therefore take time constraints into account when scheduling <b>adaptation</b> <b>actions.</b> This paper describes an algorithm for time-bounded scheduling of <b>adaptation</b> <b>actions</b> and demonstrates the validity of its results. ...|$|R

40|$|Transformative {{actions are}} {{increasingly}} being required to address changes in climate. As an aid to understanding and supporting informed decision-making regarding transformative change, we draw on theories from both the resilience and vulnerability literature to produce the <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Action</b> Cycles concept and applied framework. The resulting <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Action</b> Cycles provides a novel conceptualisation of incremental and transformative adaptation as a continuous process depicted by two concentric and distinct, yet linked, action learning cycles. Each cycle represents four stages in the decision-making process, which {{are considered to be}} undertaken over relatively short timeframes. The concept is translated into an applied framework by adopting a contextual, actor-focused suite of questions at each of the four stages. This approach compliments existing theories of transition and transformation by operationalising assessments at the individual and enterprise level. Empirical validation of the concept was conducted by collaborating with members of the Australian wine industry to assess their decisions and actions taken in response to climate change. The contiguous stages represented in the <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Action</b> Cycles aptly reflected the diverse range of decision-making and action pathways taken in recent years by those interviewed. Results suggest that incremental adaptation decision-making processes have distinct characteristics, compared with those used in transformative adaptation. We provide empirical data to support past propositions suggesting dependent relationships operate between incremental and transformative scales of adaptation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{challenges}} prevent {{climate change adaptation}} activities from contributing to vulnerability reduction. Some of these relate to the nature and quality of vulnerability assessments, while others concern how well assessments link with <b>adaptation</b> <b>actions.</b> By highlighting four persistent assumptions {{about the role of}} vulnerability assessments in adaptation, this paper seeks to identify ways in which the practice of vulnerability assessment can better support progressive <b>adaptation</b> <b>actions.</b> This paper argues that, for <b>adaptation</b> <b>actions</b> identified within vulnerability assessments to be successful, {{there is a need for}} assessment to: (i) engage with marginalized perspectives; (ii) draw upon diverse knowledge domains; (iii) integrate scales of analysis with appropriate scales of action; and (iv) build political will. This requires vulnerability assessment to be considered as more than just a method for information generation on who is most vulnerable to climate change, where they are located and the underlying reasons for their vulnerability. In addition, improving the rigor and transparency of assessments and engagement with stakeholders during the assessment process can better facilitate vulnerability-focused adaptation. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With the {{emergence}} of large-scale complex systems, the boundary between humans and software becomes increasingly blurry. Adaptation mechanisms thus {{need to consider the}} interaction structure amongst users to derive appropriate <b>adaptation</b> <b>actions.</b> Most existing systems, however, lack such collaboration awareness and thus cannot deliver the required flexibility that large-scale collaboration need to remain operational. In this paper, we analyze the flexibility of the underlying collaboration structures based on behavior, asynchrony, state, and execution context. The evaluation of three collaboration patterns and exemplary real world systems demonstrates that collaboration pattern awareness is of uttermost importance for apprehending a system’s adaptation constraints and subsequently enacting appropriate <b>adaptation</b> <b>actions.</b> Keywords—collaboration patterns, software architecture, evaluation framework, adaptation flexibility I...|$|R

40|$|Computing {{devices are}} {{becoming}} computing platforms. Not {{the operating system}} and hardware characteristics will determine the footprint of an application, but the resources that are available at runtime. To function well in both high and low resource availability situations, applications have to adapt themselves at runtime. This paper presents a light-weight mechanism for specifying timing driven adaptation at the architectural level. A key contribution is the introduction of architectural quality reflection and adaptation points. Reflection points encapsulate end- 2 -end monitoring of timing constraints. Adaptation points offer run-time adaptation based on component and component group reconfigurations. Because of the clear separation of reflection and adaptation, the logic that links constraint violations to <b>adaptation</b> <b>actions</b> can work on two different levels. Constraint violations can be explicitly linked to <b>adaptation</b> <b>actions</b> for inter-application <b>adaptation,</b> or they can trigger <b>adaptation</b> <b>actions</b> of other applications to free up resources.

40|$|Problem, {{research}} strategy, and findings: Many global {{cities are}} making good progress on climate adaptation. There is less information, however, on climate adaptation among smaller cities and towns: Are their approaches similar when undertaking adaptation? Do the barriers they face mirror those of large cities? In this study, we undertake fine-grained empirical {{research on the}} perceptions of 18 municipal planners in 14 coastal cities and towns in Massachusetts; our fi ndings are thus limited to planners’ perceptions of efforts and barriers in one region of the United States. These communities are {{very early in the}} uptake of climate adaptation policies and use a range of approaches when they do begin adaptation, including planning, mainstreaming, or addressing current hazards. The planners interviewed reported that barriers to adaptation actions tend to be interconnected; for example, the strength of private property interests often limits local political leadership on the issue. Without such leadership, it is diffi cult for planners to allocate time and/or money to adaptation activities. It is also challenging to gain support from local residents for climate <b>adaptation</b> <b>action,</b> while a lack of accepted technical data complicates efforts. Takeaway for practice: In coastal Massachusetts, and perhaps elsewhere, local residents, planners, and their municipal bodies, as well as the states, must act in multiple ways to encourage the development of meaningful climate <b>adaptation</b> <b>action</b> in smaller cities and towns.

To address these challenges, implementing adaptation measures is inevitable. The paper provides insights into climate change related risks, opportunities and adaptation actions based on responses by 40 European cities to the 2014 CDP Cities Information Request. The analysis shows that 92. 5 % of the responding European cities report that they face physical risks arising from climate change and that they identify more intense rainfall as the most relevant physical risk. Furthermore, {{more than half of the}} participants indicate that they are facing social risks due to climate change with increased risk to already vulnerable populations being the most important one. However, 72. 5 % of the cities report that they see economic opportunities arising from climate change.

City governments show great awareness, interest and knowledge in addressing climate change issues, yet there is still demand for information and guidance. Moreover, the variety of answers shows that there is no "one-size fits all solution" for cities to adapt to climate change. Thus, the findings can also serve as an innovative starting point for further research as well as the practical implementation of adaptation measures...|$|E
40|$|The Netherlands is {{particularly}} vulnerable for {{the impacts of}} climate change on the water system. Regional water authorities, or water boards, are given {{an important role to}} design and implement specific adaptation policies and measures to manage these impacts. From the early 2000 s onwards water boards are starting to adapt to climate change impacts, yet no systematic assessments exist to assess whether or not progress is being made and what explains similarities and differences across water boards. This paper aims to address these critical questions by analyzing the progress of all Dutch water boards for the period 2005 – 2016. We systematically collected and analyzed three consecutive water management plans for all 23 water boards in the Netherlands. We use content analysis methods to analyze progress by looking into their vulnerability and three levels of adaptation: recognition, groundwork and <b>adaptation</b> <b>action.</b> The results show that over time the number of reported climate change adaptation initiatives by the water boards is increasing, but most climate change adaptation is still at the recognition or groundwork level. Our findings reveal a diversity of efforts to adapt to climate change among Dutch water boards. We conclude that while (inter) national water and climate change adaptation policies have called for more <b>adaptation</b> <b>action</b> at regional levels, the unequal progress across the Netherlands suggests that existing ‘soft’ policy measures to push for adaptation might not be sufficient to ensure progress on adaptation across all water boards. </p...|$|E

GRaBS stands for Green and Blue Space Adaptation for Urban Areas and Eco Towns. The main ideas of the project were the exchange of experiences among the 14 partners from 8 european countries and to produce an <b>adaptation</b> <b>action</b> plan concerning climate change. Due to scientific researches there are existing a lot of evidences that the climate is changing. The atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are at their highest level for 3 million years and temperatures are increasing.

The actions in these six plans are analysed for their adaptive response categories: Emphasising Nature, Emphasising Development and Managed Nature (Vasey-Ellis 2009), along with Council Governance of climate change, and Emphasising Community. Climate change planning and infrastructure responses by Queensland coastal councils mainly focus on protecting coastal development from erosion and other climate hazards, and building community resilience, supplemented by ‘soft’ environmental actions protecting nature.

40|$|Climate change {{currently}} {{represents one}} of the major global environmental problems. In order to respond to these changes, <b>adaptation</b> <b>actions</b> at all levels, from national to local, need to be undertaken (European Commission 2013). Moreover, perceptions of climate change are an important element affecting actual attitudes towards <b>adaptation</b> <b>actions</b> and influencing policy and communication regarding climate change (Lorenzoni et al. 2005). This paper presents the results of a survey on perceptions of climate change, including beliefs about climate change and attitudes towards adaptation, conducted among 1, 024 Czech citizens in October 2014. Survey results show that the majority of respondents (78 %) agreed with the statement that global climate change is happening. Positive responses about perceptions of climate change were found especially among younger people (18 to 34 years of age). In terms of adaptation measures, 51 % of respondents had adopted a variety of individual actions (ranging from water savings to property insurance), discussed in the paper in further detail. Older people (≥ 45 years of age) with higher education preferred rather technical adaptation measures (e. g. flood protection for property, installation of rainwater reservoirs, etc.). The survey represents unique insights into attitudes towards climate change within the Czech Republic which had not previously been investigated to this extent. The results provided can support decision-making regarding adaptation policy, individual <b>adaptation</b> <b>actions,</b> and communication of climate change issues towards general public.
