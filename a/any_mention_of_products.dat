Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is charged by Congress with protecting the Nation’s land, air, and water resources. Under a mandate of national environmental laws, the Agency strives to formulate and implement actions leading to a compatible balance between human activities and the ability of natural systems to support and nurture life. To meet this mandate, EPA’s research program is providing data and technical support for solving environmental problems today and building a science knowledge base necessary to manage our ecological resources wisely, understand how pollutants affect our health, and prevent or reduce environmental risks in the future...|$|E

This document was prepared for U. S. EPA’s Office of Research and Development in support of EPA’s Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS). The objective is to summarize available data used to update emissions factors for quantifying landfill gas emissions and combustion by-products using more up-to-date and representative data for U. S. municipal landfills. This document provides background information used in developing a draft of the AP- 42 section 2. 4 which provides guidance for developing estimates of landfill gas emissions for national, regional, and state emission inventories. EPA OAQPS will be conducting the review of Section 2. 4. Once comments are addressed, the AP- 42 section will be updated and available through EPA’s Technology Transfer Network (TTN) Clearinghouse for Inventories & Emission...|$|E

40|$|Series Editor’s Note: This {{series of}} {{articles}} is dedicated to Prof. Peter K. Stein, {{in honor of his}} distinguished 40 -year career as the leading educator in the engineering of measurement systems for test and evaluation. The authors are privileged to be students of Prof. Stein more years and more data channels ago than they care to remember! The basic assumption for this series is that thereader has at least a cursory familiarity with mea-surement systems for strain, under laboratory con-ditions, with both foil and wire bonded resistance strain gages. This basic familiarity includes adhesive, ce-ramic and flame spray bonding techniques; standard wiring methods; and standard signal conditioning approaches. Fur-ther, the authors assume some familiarity with system fre-quency responses. We focus, here, on foil and wire strain gages for the measurement of dynamic strain and the real problems associated with the generation of demonstrably valid dynamic strain data. Piezoresistive and semiconductor strain gages are not discussed here due to their properly infrequent use in structural dynamics testing. <b>Any</b> <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> commercial <b>products</b> in this series implies neither an endorsement nor recommendation by the authors. Products are mentioned to support explanation of funda-mental measurement principles that must be understood if valid dynamic strain data is to be acquired...|$|R

50|$|In the book, Trudeau {{claims that}} there are all-natural cures for serious {{illnesses}} including cancer, herpes, arthritis, AIDS, acid reflux disease, various phobias, depression, obesity, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, attention deficit disorder, muscular dystrophy, and that these are being deliberately hidden and suppressed from the public by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Federal Trade Commission, and the major food and drug companies, {{in an effort to}} protect the profits of these industries and the authority of the governmental agencies. Trudeau claims that the source of illness are toxins from processed food, nutritional deficiencies, and other environmental sources; and that eliminating these factors will facilitate a cure for most diseases. Trudeau claims that his lack of medical training or expertise is what makes him most qualified to investigate alternative medicine, and reports his opinions in his self-published book. The first edition of the book lacked <b>any</b> <b>mention</b> <b>of</b> specific, brand-name <b>products</b> for any illnesses within its pages, as Trudeau claims the FDA and FTC censored this information and prohibited him from publishing it in the book. Instead, the book contained references to Trudeau's subscription-based website where the actual 'cures' were supposedly posted and accessible for a monthly fee.|$|R
