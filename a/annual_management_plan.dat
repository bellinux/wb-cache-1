40|$|The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) {{which oversees}} the Tiger reserve network in the country has clearly {{articulated}} guidelines for regulated tourism of wildlife, especially related to the impact on tiger populations that adheres to the carrying capacity of the Tiger reserve. Guidelines on management and regulation of pilgrimages by religious tourists to temples within such reserves have not received proper attention in the past. Active pilgrimage sites are found {{in a number of}} Tiger reserves, the most notable being the Lord Ayyappa temple in Periyar Tiger Reserve. NTCA Guidelines indicate every Tiger reserve to draw a plan of action to manage and regulate religious tourism within 3 years of notification of the NTCA guidelines. Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve in the State of Rajasthan, has an ancient Trinethra Ganesha temple which is visited regularly i. e., daily, weekly, monthly and during the annual Ganesh Chaturthi festival by local, regional and national pilgrims. It is estimated to attract not less 8 - 10 lakh people annually 2. A project to meet the clause on Religious tourism indicated by NTCA guidelines was perceived and jointly implemented by ATREE and ARC in association with the Forest Department for Ranthambhore Tiger reserve along with local conservation and community NGO partners, -Tiger Watch and Prakratik Society. The model comprised co-management of regulating the festival impact. It involved multiple stakeholders including the Forest department (assisted by local district administration, wherever necessary), Trinethra Ganesh Temple Trust, Conservation organizations such as Tiger Watch, World Wildlife Fund, Ranthambhore Foundation and community NGOs under the flagship of Prakratik Society, namely Bhu Premi Parivaar, Kids for Tigers, Ranthambhore Art & Wildlife Conservation Society (RAWCS), Dalit Vikas Sahayata Samithi, etc. (see Appendix- 2 for list of participating stakeholders). The Outreach component had some of these multiple stakeholders formulating various components of a Green Ganesha-Clean Ganesha (GG-CG) campaign to target various audiences. A popular theme song of the campaign announcing the ban on plastics and associated penalty was composed in the local dialect; a mobile tableau with the theme song, banners, posters and pamphlets espousing religious beliefs supporting nature conservation spread the message in Sawai Madhopur town and many nearby villages. Awareness and education banners, posters, signature campaigns, appeals by the Temple trust, talks with educational institutions/community organizations were undertaken a month prior to the festival. A major intervention component this year was frisking and replacement of polythene bags by cloth bags, by community volunteers with the help from the Ranthambhore Forest Department. The cloth bags were tailored by under privileged women groups which emerged as a social spin off to the entire effort. The model had a monitoring component of which assessment of pilgrim flow, garbage generation, pre and post festival impact on water quality tests of water bodies and road kills was a part. Social surveys of pilgrim perception and attitude to assess their willingness to reduce impact was done prior to, during and post-festival. Use of religious beliefs supporting conservation was also assessed. The project effectively brought conservation groups, community groups and religious institutions together. More engagement by the District Administration and Panchayats in this program can further reduce the negative environment impacts drastically. Additionally, monitoring should extend to biodiversity aspects in the pilgrimage area related to the flora, fauna and their ecosystems, to serve as an important feedback for further action/intervention by forest managers. Community outreach can also be fined tuned as many "place of origin of pilgrims' (see Appendix 6 and 7) have been identified through surveys. We propose this effort {{to become a part of}} the <b>annual</b> <b>management</b> <b>plan</b> of forest department to be implemented every year...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} understand how wetlands maintain a water supply in the Bear River Basin, where water is generally scarce. Research was conducted through semi-structured interviews with wetland and water experts in the basin and archival research of historical documents and water rights. The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages three refuges on the Bear River, and has obtained water rights portfolios for each. Holding water rights does not ensure {{that there will be}} water available for refuge wetlands. Instead, position in relation to other powerful water users is {{the most important factor in}} determining the security of a refuge 2 ̆ 7 s water supply and the threats faced from drought. All refuges must manage their water because the human-hydrology of the river is complex and variable; this requires a combination of infrastructure and planning. Maintaining relationships with other water users is another important adaptation to the human-hydrology of the river, because all water users along the river are interconnected. Recognizing that they face the same threats to their water supply allows wetland managers and irrigators to cooperate in order to maintain the water supply for their region of the river and increases adaptability as the region faces climate change. The Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge is the oldest refuge on the river and has the least secure water supply, despite having the largest water rights portfolio. Because it is chronically short of water during the summer, refuge staff have developed an adaptive management strategy to effectively utilize the water they do receive. Management involves predicting water supplies each year, setting water level targets accordingly, actively diverting water to priority wetlands, and allowing non-priority wetland to dry. This is followed by extensive monitoring of habitat conditions and bird use, the results of which are shared in <b>annual</b> <b>management</b> <b>plans.</b> This strategy maintains the most wildlife habitat possible and offers important institutional adaptations. Most importantly, it demonstrates the refuge 2 ̆ 7 s water rights are being put to beneficial use. Sharing knowledge gained through management also builds trust and adaptive capacity among water users facing the complex human-hydrology at the end of the Bear River...|$|R

The authors use the APEV scale to generate a scorecard of performance in exporting (the PERFEX scorecard) to assess export performance at the corporate level while comparatively evaluating all export ventures of the firm.

The purpose of the environmental analysis (EA) is to recommend <b>annual</b> <b>management</b> measures for fishing year 2004 to ensure that the annual fishing targets specified in the Fishery <b>Management</b> <b>Plan</b> for this species are attained. The management alternatives analyzed in this document address the allocation of the TAL into a commercial quota and a recreational harvest limit. Measures being specified for 2004 are specified to achieve a fishing mortality rate of 0. 184. Projection results indicate that the bluefish stock will increase from an estimated biomass of 129. 367 million lb in 2003 to 165. 853 million lb in 2004. This biomass can produce a total allowable catch (TAC) of 34. 215 million lb in 2004 at F= 0. 184. The TAL for 2004 is derived from this value by subtracting estimated discards from the TAC. Discards in 2004 are estimated to be 2. 365 million lb, equal to the average recreational discards for 1998 - 2002. This results in a TAL for 2004 of 31. 850 million lb. In their final deliberations, the Council and Commission considered all the alternatives and comments and adopted the TAL recommendation of 31. 850 million lb. Under Alternative 1 (Preferred Measures) the TAL is further allocated into a 10. 401 million lb adjusted commercial quota and a 21. 150 million lb adjuste...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEffective natural {{resource}} management relies on accurate and timely {{information on the}} natural environment, which may be obtained by formal (“scientific”) or informal (“local” or “traditional”) methods. Formal monitoring methods are well documented and widely accepted among the rangeland science community, yet adoption by U. S. ranchers is inconsistent. In contrast, informal monitoring appears to be widely used by ranchers, but its practice and importance have rarely been documented or assessed. By interviewing ranchers and government agency personnel, we evaluated informal monitoring {{in and around the}} Altar Valley, Arizona, United States. Informal monitoring techniques included qualitative visual appraisals of forage quantity, indicator species and erosion, and incorporated local environmental history. The environmental knowledge embedded in informal monitoring was generally compatible with natural science. Informal monitoring was conducted continuously throughout the year and provided near real-time assessments that integrated observations of most land in individual pastures and ranches. In contrast, formal monitoring was generally performed only once per year, in a limited number of areas and with a delay of a few months between observation and completion of analysis. Thus informal monitoring had higher spatial coverage and temporal resolution and provided assessments faster than formal monitoring. Consequently, ranchers generally considered informal monitoring to be more relevant than formal monitoring to formulating yearly grazing plans and responding rapidly to unpredictable changes in the natural environment. Ranchers incorporated informal monitoring into assessments of rangeland trends and outcomes of conservation measures and thereby into choices of grazing system and <b>planning</b> of brush <b>management</b> and erosion control. Thus informal monitoring was foundational to long-term conservation, <b>annual</b> rangeland <b>management</b> <b>planning,</b> and adaptive {{natural resource}} management on subyearly timescales. If informal monitoring is of comparable utility in other rural communities, it would appear advantageous to document and evaluate informal approaches and to incorporate them into formal conservation planning...|$|R
