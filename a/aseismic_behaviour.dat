30|$|The slip {{behaviour}} on {{subduction zone}} megathrusts is generally characterized by predominantly aseismic slip in the shallow, up-dip region at temperatures below approximately 150 °C, a seismogenic zone at intermediate depths and temperatures (10 to 40  km or 150 °C to 350 °C) where most large interplate earthquakes originate, and <b>aseismic</b> <b>behaviour</b> at greater depths down-dip (e.g. Hyndman et al. 1997). Drilling investigations and studies of exhumed megathrusts {{indicate that the}} plate boundary is commonly localized within marine (meta)sediments subducted at the trench (e.g. Moore 1989; Saffer et al. 2012; Shipboard Scientific Party 2001, 2003). When these sediments are predominantly pelitic in composition, {{as is often the}} case (for example at Nankai or Barbados; e.g. Underwood 2007), it is reasonable to expect that the observed transitions in seismogenic behaviour may be related to changes with depth and/or temperature in the frictional properties of the subducted (meta)pelites.|$|E
30|$|The aseismic {{parts of}} shear systems at mid-to deep crustal levels can localise {{the supply of}} deeply-sourced, high {{pressure}} fluids into the shallower level parts of these systems in the seismogenic regime. Even during deformation at elevated temperatures in mid-to deep crustal shear zones, high pore fluid factors promote grain-scale to macroscopic fracture growth and permeability enhancement. The evolution of permeability is governed by dynamic competition between crack growth and crack sealing/healing processes. Steady state creep below the seismic-aseismic transition leads to steady state permeability and continuous fluid flow. In contrast, within and near {{the base of the}} seismogenic regime, large cyclic changes in permeability can lead to episodic fluid flow and fluctuations in fluid pressure. At mid-crustal depths, temporal and spatial variations in pore fluid pressure and shear stress within shear networks influence rupture nucleation via cyclic changes in shear strength. Fluid pressure and shear stress cycling can also drive repeated transitions between interseismic creep and rapid, co-seismic slip. Reaction-weakening and reaction-strengthening, during hydrothermal alteration in fluid-active shear systems, can also drive transitions between seismic and <b>aseismic</b> <b>behaviour</b> on longer time-scales.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} and meet CO 2 emission regulations, long-term CO 2 storage in hydrocarbon reservoirs {{is one of}} the most attractive large-scale options. To ensure save anthropogenic storage, it is important to maintain the sealing integrity of potential storage complexes. It is therefore particularly important to preserve the sealing integrity of any (pre-) existing faults present in these complexes, as these might start to leak due to fault re-activation upon any physical or chemical perturbation resulting from CO 2 injection or exposure. In addition, reactivation of such faults might also lead to induced seismicity. Potential storage complexes may consist of quartz-rich sandstones capped by clay-rich seals. Therefore, in order to gain a better insight in the seismic risk and the risk of leakage due to geological CO 2 storage, a quantitative understanding of the coupling between the chemical-mechanical effects of CO 2 injection and exposure on the frictional strength and stability as well as the transport properties of faults intersecting quartz-rich sandstones and/or clay-rich caprocks is needed. In this study, the coupled chemical-mechanical effects of long-term CO 2 -fluid-rock interactions on the frictional and transport properties of simulated fault gouges composed of sandstone reservoir rock and carbonate-bearing clay-rich caprocks are tested. In order to do that, friction experiments are conducted at conditions similar to those of potential CO 2 storage reservoirs at a depth of ~ 2 - 4 km depth. The experimental results show that simulated fault gouges derived from natural sandstones with small amounts of reactive minerals are hardly affected by long-term CO 2 -exposure and as a result, the frictional behaviour and transport properties of these gouges will not be affected significantly. On the other hand, the presence of > 40 % of carbonates in a sandstone fault gouge, e. g. occurring naturally or via precipitation due to CO 2 leakage along the fault, may result in a small increase in the frictional strength and transport properties. However, this carbonate increase may also make the fault gouge become more prone to (micro) seismicity when at an in-situ temperature > 100 °C. When testing systematically the effect of CO 2 exposure or leakage by gradually increasing the calcite concentration in simulated quartz-calcite, clay-calcite and clay-quartz-calcite mixtures a similar increase in frictional strength with increasing calcite content is observed. Moreover, these mixtures also start to become more prone to (micro) seismicity for calcite concentrations > 90 % in clay(-quartz) -calcite mixtures and ~ 50 % in quartz-calcite mixtures and at in-situ temperatures of 150 °C. More complex CO 2 -fluid-rock interactions in clay-quartz-calcite mixtures are predicted when using geochemical modelling. Friction results for multiple CO 2 exposure scenarios show that the frictional strength increases with respect to the unexposed composition, while the gouges exhibited stable (<b>aseismic)</b> <b>behaviour</b> at in-situ temperature of 100 °C. At a temperature of 150 °C, however, the compositions may become prone to unstable (seismogenic) behaviour. Shear experiments testing the leakage potential of a simulated, naturally derived clay-quartz-calcite fault gouge composition show that the potential for CO 2 leakage along a fault is higher than across a fault, but that the leakage potential decreases with increasing shear displacement of the fault (maturity) and increasing effective normal stress (depth) ...|$|E
