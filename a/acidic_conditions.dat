5|$|The Fischer indole {{synthesis}} is {{a chemical}} reaction {{that produces the}} aromatic heterocycle indole from a (substituted) phenylhydrazine and an aldehyde or ketone under <b>acidic</b> <b>conditions.</b> The reaction was discovered in 1883 by Hermann Emil Fischer.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is an {{oxidizing}} agent. Depending on the reaction, {{this may}} be due to the Pb2+(aq) ion, which has a standard reduction potential (E0) of −0.125V, or the nitrate ion, which under <b>acidic</b> <b>conditions</b> has an E0 of +0.956V. The nitrate would function at high temperatures or in an acidic condition, while the lead(II) works best in a neutral aqueous solution.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin (O-phosphoryl-4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, 4-PO-Psilocin, or 4-PO-HO-DMT) is a prodrug that is {{converted}} into the pharmacologically active compound psilocin {{in the body}} by a dephosphorylation reaction. This chemical reaction takes place under strongly <b>acidic</b> <b>conditions,</b> or under physiological conditions in the body, through the action of enzymes called alkaline phosphatases.|$|E
50|$|This purine {{is highly}} {{hydrophilic}} and thermostable, {{it is not}} destroyed by cooking. Moreover, is very stable in usual storage, specially in <b>acidic</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|R
50|$|In a weakly <b>acidic</b> <b>condition,</b> fairly {{concentrated}} (35%) H2O2 solution {{undergoes a}} rapid oxidative reaction with no competitive reduction reaction of HClO2 to form HOCl.|$|R

5|$|Acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid, {{and very}} little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell {{membrane}} in the <b>acidic</b> <b>conditions</b> of the stomach. The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionised. Owing {{to the formation of}} concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the sites}} {{are located in the}} Highlands and Islands. This may be because of the {{relatively}} sparse modern populations and consequent lack of disturbance. Much of the area also has a thick covering of peat that preserves stone fragments, although the associated <b>acidic</b> <b>conditions</b> tend to dissolve organic materials. There are also numerous important remains in the Orkney archipelago, where sand and arable land predominate. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures that may have helped to preserve their integrity.|$|E
5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes fairly quickly, {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times {{as well as the}} other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 if there are no carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with goethite, ferric oxide colloids, and several clays including kaolinite and smectite. Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly <b>acidic</b> <b>conditions</b> as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) in a relatively short period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by humic acid if it is present on the surface of goethite, hematite, and magnetite. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, granodiorite, and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly <b>acidic</b> <b>conditions.</b> It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E
40|$|Hydrothermal {{alteration}} experiments of olivine powder {{with several}} Fe/Mg ratios {{were carried out}} under <b>acidic</b> and neutral <b>conditions,</b> and transition electron microscopy (TEM) observations were made on the run products. Well-developed tubular crystals of serpentine (chrysotile) were synthesized from Fo 100 under both <b>acidic</b> and neutral <b>conditions,</b> and from Fo 92 and Fo 80 under <b>acidic</b> <b>condition.</b> Abundance and size of chrysotile apparenlty dependent on the Fe contents of olivine, i. e. with increasing Fe contents, less and smaller chrysotile was formed. Acidity of the solution {{plays an important role}} for the formation of chrysotile. Platy and fibrous crystals of phyllosilicate, probably serpentine, were obtained from Fo 50 and Fo 20 treated under <b>acidic</b> <b>condition,</b> which are most similar to the phyllosilicates in the CI and CM chondrites. Framboidal aggregates of Fe-rich grains (presumably Fe-hydroxide) were formed from Fa 100 and Fo 20, but no phyllosilicate was formed from Fa 100...|$|R
40|$|A {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) method was developed for the separation of lovastatin (LT) and its derivatives. The conversion of LT and its derivatives in alkaline or acidic solution in different storage times was also investigated by HPLC. The results showed that LT was present in different forms: as a lactone, as lovastatin acid (LA), and as its methyl ester (LM) under <b>acidic</b> <b>condition.</b> Well-resolved peaks of three forms compounds of lovastatin were separated on a Symmetry C 18 column (4. 6 × 250 mm i. d., particle size 5 µm) using acetonitrile–water (77 : 23, v/v) as the mobile phase at pH 3. 0. The retention time of LA, LT, LM was 6. 41 ± 0. 25 min, 8. 89 ± 0. 25 min, 9. 73 ± 0. 25 min, respectively. LT only converted to LA when LT was treated with 0. 1 M NaOH. Under the <b>acidic</b> <b>condition,</b> {{with the increase of}} storage time, LT converted to LA, following LA would be transformed to LT and LM. Apparently, containing high concentrations of methanol in acidic methanol solutions might facilitate the conversion of LA to LM, and conversion of LT, LA, and LM would almost reach equilibrium after 60 h. The concentration of methanol and the storage time would also change the form of the LT when LA, LT, and LM were extracted by methanol–water in <b>acidic</b> <b>condition.</b> So the determination and separation of LA and LT should possibly exclude methanol in <b>acidic</b> <b>condition...</b>|$|R
50|$|Chief cells {{release the}} zymogen (enzyme precursor) pepsinogen when stimulated {{by a variety}} of factors {{including}} cholinergic activity from the vagus nerve and <b>acidic</b> <b>condition</b> in the stomach. Gastrin and secretin may also act as secretagogues.|$|R
5|$|Poliovirus uses two key {{mechanisms}} {{to evade the}} immune system. First, {{it is capable of}} surviving the highly <b>acidic</b> <b>conditions</b> of the stomach, allowing the virus to infect the host and spread throughout the body via the lymphatic system. Second, because it can replicate very quickly, the virus overwhelms the host organs before an immune response can be mounted. If detail is given at the attachment phase; poliovirus with canyons on the virion surface have virus attachment sites located in pockets at the canyon bases. The canyons are too narrow for access by antibodies, so the virus attachment sites are protected from the host’s immune surveillance, while the remainder of the virion surface can mutate to avoid the host’s immune response.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} usually {{occurs in}} the complete absence of a base or the presence of only a weak base (<b>acidic</b> <b>conditions</b> and high temperature).|$|E
25|$|Dextrins can be {{produced}} from starch using enzymes like amylases, as during digestion {{in the human body}} and during malting and mashing, or by applying dry heat under <b>acidic</b> <b>conditions</b> (pyrolysis or roasting). The latter process is used industrially, and also occurs on the surface of bread during the baking process, contributing to flavor, color and crispness. Dextrins produced by heat are also known as pyrodextrins. The starch hydrolyses during roasting under <b>acidic</b> <b>conditions,</b> and short-chained starch parts partially rebranch with α-(1,6) bonds to the degraded starch molecule. See also Maillard Reaction.|$|E
30|$|Viscose fabric was dyed {{with three}} {{different}} natural dyes (walnut, turmeric, and henna) under different conditions. The antibacterial activity of dyed samples against E. coli were compared with treated samples containing silver nanoparticles. The results indicated that treated fabrics with these natural dyes had excellent antibacterial activity {{as well as those}} treated with Ag nanoparticles before and after wash. The dyed fabric with turmeric powder under alkaline condition created a greater effect in reducing bacteria concentration as compared to that under <b>acidic</b> <b>condition.</b> The dyed fabric with potassium bichromate mordant had good reduction of bacteria concentration in alkaline and <b>acidic</b> <b>condition.</b> Dyed sample with turmeric under neutral condition did not have good antibacterial activity.|$|R
40|$|Although {{biotrickling}} filters (BTFs) applied under <b>acidic</b> <b>condition</b> {{to remove}} H 2 S from waste gases have been reported, the removal {{behavior of the}} acidic BTF under transient condition which was normal in most industry processes, and corresponding bacterial community have not been thoroughly studied. In the present study, two BTFs were run under neutral (BTFn) and <b>acidic</b> (BTFa) <b>conditions,</b> respectively. The results revealed that the removal performance of BTFa under transient condition was superior to that of BTFn; the maximum H 2 S eliminating capacities (ECs) achieved by BTFa and BTFn were 489. 9 g/m 3 h and 443. 6 g/m 3 h, respectively. High-throughput sequencing suggested that pH was the critical factor and several other factors including nutrient and the inlet loadings also had roles in shaping bacterial community structure. Acidithiobacillus was the most abundant bacterial group. The results indicated that BTF acclimation under <b>acidic</b> <b>condition</b> may facilitate generating microbial community with high H 2 S-degrading capability...|$|R
25|$|The lactone ring in CPT {{is highly}} {{susceptible}} to hydrolysis. The open ring form is inactive {{and it must}} therefore be closed to inhibit topo I. The closed form is favored in <b>acidic</b> <b>condition,</b> {{as it is in}} many cancer cells microenvironment.|$|R

40|$|A {{sensitive}} {{spectrophotometric method}} for {{the determination of}} iodine species like iodide, iodine, iodate and periodate is described. The method involves the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite with iodate under <b>acidic</b> <b>condition.</b> The formed nitrite is determined based on the diazo coupling reaction between p-nitroaniline and N-(1 -naphthyl) ethylenediammine dihydrochloride [NEDA]. The method obeys Beer’s law in the concentration range 1 - 15 µg of iodate in an overall aqueous volume of 10 mL at 545 nm and the color is stable for 3 h. The relative standard deviation is 1. 7 % (n= 10) at 12 g of iodate. The molar absorptivity is calculated to be 8. 33 x 104 L mol- 1 cm- 1 with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9998. The developed method {{can be applied to}} samples containing iodine and iodide by oxidation to iodate using bromine solution under <b>acidic</b> <b>condition.</b> Periodate is determined by prereduction to iodate using ethylene glycol under <b>acidic</b> <b>condition.</b> The optimum experimental reaction conditions are evaluated. The effect of interfering ions on the determination of iodate is described. The proposed method has been successfully applied to the determination of iodide and iodate in salt samples, iodine in pharmaceutical preparations and added periodate in sea water sample.

30|$|At normal condition, without {{addition}} of any acid or base, pH of the aquadest sol was around 5 – 6 {{and it had}} very low level stability (0.4 %), indicating {{that almost all of}} the catalyst particles sank. On the other hand, at <b>acidic</b> <b>condition</b> (pH 2 – 3), the stability level of the aquadest sol went up to 89 %. These occasion might be ascribed to the protonation of titania particles at <b>acidic</b> <b>condition,</b> which would make the surface of titania particles become positively charged. Similar charge between particles of titania would cause the particles to repel each other, thus avoiding agglomeration of the particles [36]. This phenomenon would lead to the breakdown of TiO 2 particles into smaller particles and as the result the sol became relatively more stable [25].|$|R
30|$|The above results {{indicate}} that during the polymerization of aniline in presence of GO under <b>acidic</b> <b>condition,</b> the polar epoxy and carboxyl groups of GO interact with the radical cations of the NH groups of PANI, which results in polyaniline salt containing GO as dopant along with sulphuric acid (Scheme  2).|$|R
25|$|Class IId cover single-peptide bacteriocins, {{which are}} not post-translationally {{modified}} and do not show the pediocin-like signature.
