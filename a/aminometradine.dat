40|$|The oral {{diuretic}} amisometradine (rolicton) is an isomer of <b>aminometradine</b> (mictine) but {{is relatively}} free from toxic effects {{while maintaining a}} reasonable diuretic potency (Belle, 1957; Settel, 1957; Jose and Wood, 1958). The present {{study was designed to}} assess the usefulness of amisometradine in the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure and to compare the excre-tion of water and electrolytes produced by it with that elicited by mersalyl. MATERIAL AND METHODS Seventeen patients suffering from untreated congestive heart failure of moderate severity were treated with amisometradine. Patients whose condition made immediate therapy with diuretics imperative were excluded from the trial. Twelve of the patients were suffering from pulmonary heart failure, two from mitral stenosis, and one each from pernicious anemia and ischlemic and hypertensive heart disease. Each patient was weighed daily and received a diet containing a constant amount of sodium chloride (either 500 mg. or 2 g.) and fluid (1000 or 1200 ml.) each day. Twenty-four hour collections of urine were made from 16 patients throughout the study. One to six control days preceded the administration of a diuretic. Patients who had a spontaneous diuresis during this period wer...|$|E
