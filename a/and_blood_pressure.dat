40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> {{measurements}} {{taken at}} home by physicians, nurses, and patients with office <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement, ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring <b>and</b> home <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement. METHODS: A total of 44 patients seen by a home care program were studied. Protocol 1 a) <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> {{was measured by the}} patient, a physician and a nurse during a regular home visit (Home 1); b) home <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement was measured for 4 days (HBPM 1); c) office <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement was measured by a physician, a nurse, and the patient; and by 24 -hour ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring.

Echocardiography, guided by a two-dimensional echocardiograph, was performed. RESULTS: Protocol 1 : a) office <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement <b>and</b> Home 1 were significantly higher than ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring, except for systolic <b>and</b> diastolic office <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement taken by the patient or a family member, systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> taken by a nurse, <b>and</b> diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> taken by a physician. b) ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring <b>and</b> HBPM 1 were similar. Protocol 2 : a) HBPM 2 and Home 2 were similar. b) Home 2 was significantly lower than Home 1, except for diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> taken by a nurse or the patient. There were significant relationships between: a) diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measured by the patient and the thickness of the interventricular septum, posterior wall, and left ventricular mass; and b) ambulatory and HBPM 2 diastolic <b>and</b> systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> taken by a physician (home 2) and left ventricular mass.

50|$|There are no {{absolute}} contraindications {{to the use}} of dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine has a biphasic {{effect on}} <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> with decreased <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> observed at lower concentrations <b>and</b> elevated <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> at higher concentrations. Rapid IV administration or bolus has been associated with slow heart rate (bradycardia) <b>and</b> low <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (hypotension) due to peripheral α2-receptor stimulation.|$|R
5|$|Its effects, {{depending}} on dosage, include {{an increase in}} sodium excretion by the kidneys, an increase in urine output, an increase in heart rate, {{and an increase in}} blood pressure. At low doses it acts through the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart muscle contraction force and heart rate, thereby increasing cardiac output <b>and</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> Higher doses also cause vasoconstriction that further increases blood pressure. Older literature also describes very low doses thought to improve kidney function without other consequences, but recent reviews have concluded that doses at such low levels are not effective and may sometimes be harmful. While some effects result from stimulation of dopamine receptors, the prominent cardiovascular effects result from dopamine acting at α1, β1, and β2 adrenergic receptors.|$|E

Neelix (Ethan Phillips) and Kes agonize over whether to have children and the ramifications of becoming parents. After discussing children and family with Lieutenant Tuvok (Tim Russ), Neelix decides he's ready to be a father, while Kes has instead decided against it.

40|$|Background: <b>Blood</b> <b>pressure</b> varies between populations due {{to ethnic}} and {{environmental}} factors. Therefore, normal <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> values should be determined for different populations. Aims: The {{aim of this}} survey was to produce <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> nomograms for Lebanese children {{in order to establish}} distribution curves of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> by age <b>and</b> sex. Subjects and Methods: We conducted a survey of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in 5710 Lebanese schoolchildren aged 5 to 15 years (2918 boys and 2792 girls), and studied the distribution of systolic <b>and</b> diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in these children <b>and</b> adolescents. <b>Blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer using a standardized technique. Results: Both systolic <b>and</b> diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> had a positive correlation with weight, height, age, and body mass index (r= 0. 648, 0. 643, 0. 582, and 0. 44, respectively) (P <. 001). There {{was no significant difference in}} the systolic <b>and</b> diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in boys compared to girls of corresponding ages. However, the average annual increase in systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was 2. 86 mm Hg in boys and 2. 63 mm Hg in girls, whereas the annual increase in diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was 1. 72 mm Hg in boys and 1. 48 mm Hg in girls.

OBJECTIVES This study was conducted to investigate the association between serum lipids <b>and</b> level of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in type 2 diabetic patients (T 2 D). PATIENTS AND METHODS A prospective analytical study was carried out in 60 patients with T 2 D of both genders. None of the patients had a history of hypertension, and none was treated with antihypertensive drugs. Resting systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>and</b> fifth phase diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> were measured three times while the subjects were seated, and the results were averaged second and third measurements. Sixty patients with T 2 D were enrolled to the study. None of the patients who had a history of gout, was treated with allopurinol or treated with antihypertensive drugs previously. RESULTS Of 60 participants, mean of serum creatinine was 0. 98 ± 0. 22 mg/dL. Mean of systolic <b>and</b> diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was 133 ± 13 mmHg and 84 ± 7. 4 mmHg respectively. In this study, a significant positive correlation of serum cholesterol with systolic (r= 0. 598, p= 0. 001) <b>and</b> diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (r= 0. 584, p= 0. 001) was seen. Also the associations of serum LDL-C with systolic <b>and</b> diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> were as follow (r = 0. 335, p< 0. 001) and (0. 491, p< 0. 001) respectively.

Recent {{studies indicate that}} discrepancies in performance between these devices may differ between healthy and diabetic subjects. Arterial stiffness in diabetics could be the underlying factor explaining these differences. We studied differences between a Dinamap oscillometric <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitor <b>and</b> a random-zero sphygmomanometer in relation to arterial stiffness in 1808 healthy elderly subjects. The study was conducted within the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort study of subjects aged 55 years and older. Systolic <b>and</b> diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> differences between a Dinamap and a random-zero sphygmomanometer were related to arterial stiffness, as measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. Increased arterial stiffness was associated with higher systolic <b>and</b> diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> readings by the Dinamap compared with the random-zero sphygmomanometer, independent of age, gender, <b>and</b> average mean <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> level of both devices. The beta-coefficient (95 % CI) was 0. 25 (0. 00 to 0. 50) mm Hg/(m/s) for the systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> difference <b>and</b> 0. 35 (0. 20 to 0. 50) mm Hg/(m/s) for the diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> difference.
