40|$|Reverse {{mortgages}} {{have continued}} to increase in popularity in Australia, with many seniors agreeing to mortgage their home. However, since the largest asset for many ageing households is their primary place of residence, consideration {{should be given to}} the level of risk that seniors may be exposed to. At the same time, there have been demographic changes that have placed pressure on the regular income of retirees, many of whom have no superannuation fund. For example, life expectancy rates continue to rise and there are an increasing proportion of single person households in society. This has placed additional pressure on financial resources of retirees, especially those with a substantial investment in their family home and a relatively small pension. This paper focuses on the potential for reverse mortgages to be both successfully used and also misunderstood by Australian seniors. It considers the recent growth in reverse mortgages in Australia and discusses some preliminary findings.

40|$|Patients with rheumatic {{diseases}} {{are at high}} risk of infections. As quantification and characterization of infections in daily practice is a crucial exercise to delineate strategies to overcome this problem, we aimed to describe the prevalence of infections in an inpatient rheumatology unit. A cross-sectional analysis of all patients admitted at the São João Hospital Centre Rheumatology Unit between January 1 st 2012 and December 31 st 2013 was performed. We found a 31. 7 % (n= 79) period prevalence of infection and a total number of infections of 97 (1. 23 infections per patient). They were the admission reason in 17. 6 % (n= 44) and hospital acquired in 19. 0 % (n= 15) of the cases. The urinary tract was the most commonly affected (32. 0 %; n= 31) and Escherichia coli (17. 5 %; n= 17) the most frequently identified infectious agent. Infection prolonged the hospital length of stay in 34. 2 % (n= 27) of the cases but any death occurred as a direct consequence of it. Patients with infection were older, had longer rheumatic disease duration and longer hospital length of stay than those without infection.

40|$|Apoptosis {{has been}} defined as "gene-directed {{cellular}} self-destruction" and is an active process that is tightly regulated by a number of gene products, which promote or block cell death. Apoptotic death can be triggered by a wide variety of stimuli <b>and,</b> <b>importantly,</b> <b>not</b> all cells necessarily undergo apoptosis in response to the same stimulus. Abnormal regulation of apoptosis has been implicated {{in a wide range of}} diseases and approaches to modifying apoptosis represent important future therapeutic strategies. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and relentless disease involving scarring of the lung, which has been recognised as the most lethal interstitial lung disease. In the lungs of IPF patients, increased epithelial apoptosis, together with decreased apoptosis of myofibroblasts, represents persistent findings (particularly in areas of collagen deposition) supporting an interaction between altered apoptosis and the pathogenesis of the disease. Data from human tissues and animal models are refining current knowledge of the processes involved in this pathogenesis. This has challenged the dogma that IPF is purely a disease of unresolved inflammation by emphasising the central roles played by the alveolar epithelial cell and myofibroblasts and, as part of that role, the importance of altered apoptosis. Evidence suggests blockade of epithelial cell apoptosis can prevent subsequent collagen deposition, and induction of myofibroblast apoptosis, at least theoretically, would be expected to resolve ongoing fibrosis. These two concepts raise the prospect of therapeutic intervention aimed at modifying apoptosis and, thus, fibrosis in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis...|$|E

40|$|Chlamydial disease {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the main factors threatening the long-term survival of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). Despite this, large epidemiological studies of chlamydial infection and disease in wild koala populations are lacking. A better understanding of the prevalence, transmission and pathogenesis is needed to improve control measures, such as the development of vaccines. We investigated the prevalence of Chlamydia pecorum infection and disease in 160 koalas in a peri-urban wild population in Queensland, Australia and found that 31 % of koalas were Chlamydia PCR positive and 28 % had clinically detectable chlamydial disease. Most infections were at the urogenital site (27 %; both males and females) with only 14 % at the ocular site. Interestingly, we found that 27 % (4 / 15) of koalas considered to be sexually immature (9 - 13 months) were already infected with C. pecorum, suggesting that a significant percentage of animals are infected directly from their mother. Ocular infection levels were less prevalent with increasing age (8 % in koalas older than 4 years), whereas the prevalence of urogenital tract infections remained high into older age (26 % in koalas older than 4 years), suggesting that, after mother-to-young transmission, C. pecorum is predominantly a sexually transmitted infection. While 28 % of koalas in this population had clinically detectable chlamydial disease (primarily urogenital tract disease), many PCR positive koalas had no detectable disease <b>and</b> <b>importantly,</b> <b>not</b> all diseased animals were PCR positive. We also observed higher chlamydial loads in koalas who were C. pecorum infected without clinical disease than in koalas who were C. pecorum infected with clinical disease.

40|$|PurposeCarotid artery stenting is a {{relatively}} new intervention for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis, and the long-term outcomes and complications are therefore yet to be determined. In one surgeon's practice, it was found that a stent fracture was the etiological factor for recurrent stenosis. A retrospective study was therefore performed with the hypothesis that carotid stent fractures are common. The aims were to determine prevalence of fractures in this surgeon's series, risk factors, and most importantly, clinical relevance. MethodsPatients from one surgeon's private practice who had carotid stenosis deemed suitable for intervention (> 80 % asymptomatic, > 70 % symptomatic, 50 % to 70 % if an ulcerated lesion) and had suitable aortic and carotid morphology for carotid stenting between March 2004 and December 2006 were included. To enhance the quality of the measurement, two vascular surgeons and one radiologist examined the films independently to determine if there was a fracture present. Given that this was a retrospective study, there was no preconceived sample size determined. ResultsFracture prevalence was found to be 29. 2 % or 14 out of 48 stents. Restenosis occurred in 21 % of those stents with a detected fracture, after an average follow-up of 15 months. Several anetiological factors are proposed, with a finding in this series, of a strong and significant association between the presence of calcified vessels and the presence of fractures (odds ratio 7. 7; standard error 5. 6; 95 % confidence interval 1. 9 - 32. 0, P =. 003). ConclusionsAlthough this is a small study, it demonstrates that carotid stent fractures do exist, <b>and</b> <b>importantly,</b> <b>not</b> all of them are benign. Therefore, the authors recommend regular surveillance with plain radiography in addition to duplex ultrasonography to enable early detection of fracturing. Following detection, institution of increased surveillance frequency and/or any appropriate intervention can be implemented, to aid in the prevention of complications resulting from restenosis should it become apparent...|$|E
40|$|Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed in {{prostate}} cancer (PCa) and a promising target for molecular imaging and therapy. Nanobodies (single domain antibodies, VHH) are the smallest antibody-based fragments possessing ideal molecular imaging properties, {{such as high}} target specificity and rapid background clearance. We developed a novel anti-PSMA nanobody (JVZ- 007) for targeted imaging and therapy of PCa. Here, {{we report on the}} application of the (111) In-radiolabeled nanobody for SPECT/CT imaging of PCa. A nanobody library was generated by immunization of a llama with four human PCa cell lines. Anti-PSMA nanobodies were captured by biopanning on PSMA overexpressing cells. JVZ- 007 was selected for evaluation as imaging probe. JVZ- 007 was initially produced with a c-myc-hexahistidine (his) tag allowing purification and detection. The c-myc-his tag was subsequently replaced by a single cysteine at the C-terminus, allowing site-specific conjugation of chelates for radiolabeling. JVZ- 007 -c-myc-his was conjugated to p-SCN-DTPA via the lysines, while JVZ- 007 -cys was conjugated to maleimide-DTPA via the C-terminal cysteine. PSMA-targeting was analyzed in vitro by cell binding experiments using flow cytometry, autoradiography and internalization assays using various PCa cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Targeting properties of radiolabeled nanobodies were evaluated in vivo in biodistribution and SPECT/CT imaging experiments, using nude mice bearing PSMA-positive PC- 310 and PSMA-negative PC- 3 tumors. JVZ- 007 was successfully conjugated to DTPA for radiolabeling with (111) In at room temperature. (111) In-JVZ 007 -c-myc-his and (111) In-JVZ 007 -cys internalized in LNCaP cells, and bound to PSMA-expressing PDXs, <b>and</b> <b>importantly</b> <b>not</b> to PSMA-negative PDXs and human kidneys. Good tumor targeting and fast blood clearance were observed for (111) In-JVZ- 007 -c-myc-his and (111) In-JVZ- 007 -cys. Renal uptake of (111) In-JVZ- 007 -c-myc-his was initially high, but was efficiently reduced by co-injection of gelofusine and lysine. The replacement of the c-myc-his tag by the cysteine contributed to further reduction of renal uptake without loss of targeting. PC- 310 tumors were clearly visualized by SPECT/CT with both tracers, with very low renal uptake (< 4 %ID/g) for (111) In-JVZ- 007 -cys already at 3 h after injection. We developed an (111) In-radiolabeled anti-PSMA nanobody, showing very good tumor targeting, low uptake in non-target tissues, and low renal retention, allowing excellent SPECT/CT imaging of PCa within a few hours after injection...|$|E

40|$|Experimenting {{with minor}} {{delinquency}} and rule-breaking {{is common in}} adolescence {{to the extent that}} it has been considered by some to be typical or even adaptive adolescent behaviour. While much research has been dedicated to understanding why experimenting with delinquency is so prevalent during adolescence, this dissertation argues that in order to better understand the nature of adolescent delinquency, we need to know more about adolescents who do not engage in any delinquency or rule-breaking whatsoever (i. e., delinquency abstainers). Indeed, the results of this dissertation suggest that most adolescents do engage in at least one act of delinquency or rule-breaking (between 75 – 90 %). Furthermore, 28 % of young people engaged in minor deviancy when given a 5 -minute window of opportunity to do so. However, despite its prevalence, findings from this dissertation suggest that minor delinquency may not be an adaptive response to the challenges of adolescence. First, we found that minor delinquency and rule-breaking are related to problems with identity formation, a key developmental task during adolescence. Second, we found that delinquency abstainers scored highly on the positive personal characteristics of conscientiousness, conformity, and honesty. And while some abstainers do appear to be more socially anxious than other adolescents and social anxiety was related to less time spent with peers, non-clinical levels of social anxiety seem to be more protective than problematic. Because, and third, during adolescence, most abstainers report having a best friend, spending time with their (less delinquent) peers, and having good quality relationships with their parents. In this dissertation, we also found that even a brief exposure to a previously unknown deviant peer can increase the amount of cheating behaviour. Therefore, our results suggest that deviant peer influence can play a role in own delinquency and rule-breaking, even if best friends are not likely to be delinquent. More research needs to be conducted to understand how these positive personal characteristics reported by abstaining adolescents may help them to avoid delinquent influence during a life-stage in which at least some exposure to delinquency and rule-breaking can be expected. However, fifth <b>and</b> <b>importantly,</b> <b>not</b> all abstainers reported positive personal characteristics. We also identified a smaller subgroup of maladaptive abstainers that had poorer primary school achievement and were unpopular in childhood. Following up these two subgroups of abstainers showed that the adaptive abstainers, with positive personal characteristics, were the most successful group in later adulthood. These adolescents reported the highest amount of satisfactory achievement of what we consider to be the main developmental tasks in life (i. e., satisfactory employment, accommodation, intimate relationships, and mental health) compared to all other adolescents. In conclusion, while this dissertation provides new evidence for a subgroup of adolescents that is not delinquent but likely has psychosocial problems that negatively affect their long-term well-being, the results also suggest that, for most adolescents, despite its high prevalence, experimenting with minor delinquency is not likely to be more adaptive than delinquency abstention...|$|E
