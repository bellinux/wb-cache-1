5|$|In {{contrast}} to Matheson's {{opinion about the}} name Ljótr, the 20th-century historian A. Morrison was {{of the opinion that}} the name may not be as rare <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> have thought. Morrison noted that the 19th century antiquary F.W.L. Thomas considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr, who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time. Morrison considered it possible that Leod's name could have ultimately originated from that of Ljótólfr's; however, while he considered it possible that Ljótólfr could have been an ancestor of Leod, he did not think it could have been in the male-line.|$|E
5|$|The {{floating}} {{stage on}} which Jarre and his musicians performed {{was built on}} top of four large barges. Large purpose-built display screens were built, {{and one of the}} buildings {{to be used as a}} backdrop was painted white. One large mirror ball being transported to the event fell onto the roadside, causing a degree of confusion <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> mistook it for a fallen satellite. World War II searchlights were installed, to illuminate the sky and surrounding architecture. Along with thousands in the surrounding streets and parks, 200,000people watched Jarre and guests such as guitarist Hank Marvin perform in less than ideal conditions. Inclement weather had threatened to break the stage from its moorings, putting paid to the original plan to float the stage across the Royal Victoria Dock. Wind speeds were so high that television cameras were blown over. On the second evening the audience, which included Diana, Princess of Wales, was soaked by rain and wind.|$|E

25|$|As {{the brain}} {{receives}} its plentiful supply of afferent {{information relating to}} ventilation, {{it is able to}} compare it to the current level of respiration as determined by the efferent signals. If the level of respiration is inappropriate for the body's status then dyspnea might occur.

25|$|From the 1990s, African-American {{activists in}} Charleston {{proposed}} erecting {{a memorial to}} Denmark Vesey, to honor his effort to overturn slavery in the city. The proposal was controversial, <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> {{did not want to}} memorialize a man they considered a terrorist; others believed a memorial would not only acknowledge his leadership but would express the slaves' desire for freedom. In 2014, a statue representing Vesey as a carpenter, holding a Bible, was erected in Hampton Park, at some distance from the main tourist areas.|$|E

25|$|Through {{the thyroid}} clinic, Campos {{likewise}} pursued research on {{whether there was}} a genetic factor that contributed to endemic goiter. His findings, as contained in a paper that he published in 1961, proposed that the iodine intake deficiency thought to be the main cause of goiter {{was just one of the}} triggering factors of the disease, and that physiology and anatomy proved to be more important considerations <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> were born without the enzyme necessary to take in trace elements such as iodine even if it were present in food and water.|$|E
25|$|The {{criterion}} for assessing a belief system for Hume {{is based on}} the balance of probability whether something is more likely than not to have occurred. Since the weight of empirical experience contradicts the notion for the existence of miracles, such accounts should be treated with scepticism. Further, the myriad of accounts of miracles contradict one another, <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> who receive miracles will aim to prove the authority of Jesus, whereas others will aim to prove the authority of Muhammad or some other religious prophet or deity. These various differing accounts weaken the overall evidential power of miracles.|$|E

25|$|William Ruddiman has {{proposed}} the early anthropocene hypothesis, {{according to which}} the anthropocene era, <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> call the most recent period in the earth's history when {{the activities of the}} human species first began to have a significant global impact on the earth's climate and ecosystems, did not begin in the 18th century {{with the advent of the}} Industrial Era, but dates back to 8,000 years ago, due to intense farming activities of our early agrarian ancestors. It was at that time that atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations stopped following the periodic pattern of the Milankovitch cycles. In his overdue-glaciation hypothesis Ruddiman states that an incipient glacial would probably have begun several thousand years ago, but the arrival of that scheduled glacial was forestalled by the activities of early farmers.|$|E
25|$|There's {{a special}} case of former Soviet {{citizens}} (currently Russian Federation nationals). With {{the collapse of the}} Soviet Union, Russian Federation declared itself a continuation of the Soviet Union and even took the USSR's seat at the UN Security Council. Accordingly, 1991 Nationality Law recognised all former Soviet citizens permanently resident in the Russian Federation as Russian citizens. However, people born in Russia who weren't on the Russian territory when the law came into force, as well <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> born in the Soviet Union who lived in Russia but weren't formally domiciled there weren't granted Russian citizenship. When at December 31, 2003 former Soviet passports became invalid, those people overnight become foreigners, although many of them considered Russia their home. The majority were deprived their de-facto status of Russian Federation nationals, they lost their right to remain in Russian Federation, they were even deprived of retirement benefits and medical assistance. Their morale has also been seriously affected since they feel rejected.|$|E
25|$|In {{the state}} sector, {{children}} start {{school in the}} school year in which they turn five. They stay at primary school for seven years (although this varies even within the county, <b>as</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> have previously gone {{for four years and}} then spent another four years at a 'middle school') until they are eleven. Warwickshire {{is one of the few}} local authorities in England to still maintain the grammar school system in two districts: Stratford-on-Avon and Rugby, although Southam claims to have a comprehensive school. In the final year of primary school, children are given the opportunity of sitting the 11-plus exam to compete for a place at one of the grammar schools, with two in Stratford and Rugby and one in Alcester; these are: Stratford-upon-Avon Grammar School for Girls; King Edward VI School, a boys' school; Lawrence Sheriff Grammar School for Boys, in Rugby, as well as, Rugby High School for Girls and Alcester Grammar School (mixed). The exam is sat on three different days and consists of two verbal reasoning and mathematics papers and one extended writing paper. To maintain standards, there is a bank of papers that are used in rotation. In 2006, it was revealed in a local newspaper, the Stratford Herald, that some private 11-plus tutors had copies of the exam papers and that they were using them as practice papers for their pupils. This meant that, in some cases, pupils sitting the exam had seen the paper in advance.|$|E
