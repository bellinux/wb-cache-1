5|$|Chekhov had {{at first}} written stories only for {{financial}} gain, but as his artistic ambition grew, he made formal innovations which {{have influenced the}} evolution of the modern short story. He made no apologies for the difficulties this posed to readers, insisting that the role of an artist was to ask questions, not to <b>answer</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ramakrishna's primary biographers {{describe}} him as talkative. According to the biographers, Ramakrishna would reminisce for hours about his own eventful spiritual life, tell tales, explain Vedantic doctrines with extremely mundane illustrations, raise questions and <b>answer</b> <b>them</b> himself, crack jokes, sing songs, and mimic the ways {{of all types of}} worldly people, keeping the visitors enthralled.|$|E

Hurwitz said that If I Were You was partially inspired by the NPR show Car Talk, in that their audience listens for the banter between the two hosts, not necessarily the questions themselves.|$|E

The answers are written down, then the person signs and dates his interrogation and that's the game over.|$|E
25|$|Transcortical {{sensory aphasia}} (TSA) {{is a kind}} of aphasia that {{involves}} damage to specific areas of the temporal lobe of the brain, resulting in symptoms such as poor auditory comprehension, relatively intact repetition, and fluent speech with semantic paraphasias present. TSA is a fluent aphasia similar to Wernicke's aphasia, {{with the exception of a}} strong ability to repeat words and phrases. The person may repeat questions rather than <b>answer</b> <b>them</b> ("echolalia").|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the rule requiring a fair hearing is broad enough to include the rule against bias since a fair hearing must be an unbiased hearing. However, the rules are often treated separately. It is fundamental to fair procedure that both sides should be heard. The right to a fair hearing requires that individuals are not penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the cases against them, a fair opportunity to <b>answer</b> <b>them,</b> and the opportunity to present their own cases.|$|E

25|$|Two {{members of}} the winning family play Fast Money {{for a chance to}} win a cash bonus. One {{contestant}} is onstage with the host, while the other is sequestered backstage so that he/she cannot hear the first portion of the round. The first contestant is asked five rapid-fire survey questions and has a set time limit in which to <b>answer</b> <b>them</b> (originally 15 seconds, extended to 20 in 1994). The clock begins to run only after the first question is asked, and the first contestant may pass on a question and return to it after all five have been asked, if time remains.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} from Australia, Cowdrey decided {{to drop out of}} Oxford so he could {{concentrate}} on his career with Kent and England. No longer an undergraduate he was called up for national service, but discharged after two weeks in the Royal Air Force due to a hereditary disability of rigid toes on which he previously had an operation. This caused some controversy as he promptly made 44, 101, 5, 139, 48, 44, 115 not out and 103 not out, hardly the scores of an invalid. The press suggested that strings had been pulled on his behalf and questions were asked in the House of Commons by Gerald Nabarro MP, though he apologised after the true facts became known. Cowdrey received hate mail from the parents of national servicemen, and took great care to <b>answer</b> <b>them</b> personally. He was called up for the Third Test against South Africa, but was battered by the fast bowlers Peter Heine and Neil Adcock making 1 and 50, which he considered to be the worse bruising of his career and Cowdrey pulled out of the series rather than add to his injuries.|$|E

500|$|The MTA is also testing smaller {{ideas on}} some services. In late 2015, the F, 6, and 7 trains started having 100 [...] "station {{platform}} controllers" [...] deployed {{to manage the}} flow of passengers on and off crowded trains for maximum ridership during morning rush hours, {{for a total of}} 129 such employees; these workers also answer passengers' questions about subway directions, rather than having conductors <b>answer</b> <b>them</b> and thus delaying the trains. In early 2017, the test was expanded to the afternoon peak period with an increase of 35 platform conductors. In November of the same year, 140 platform controllers and 90 conductors gained iPhone 6S devices so they could receive notifications of, and tell riders about, subway disruptions. Subway guards, the predecessors to the platform controllers, were first used during the Great Depression and World War II.|$|E
500|$|Critic Darcy Sullivan saw {{the book}} as {{presenting}} how Brown's Playboy obsession affects his ability to relate to women. [...] Sullivan called The Playboy stories [...] "he most honest sex in comics" [...] of the early 1990s, [...] "and the most damning exposé of pornography" [...] as it deals [...] "with nothing more than Brown's relationship with Playboy". [...] He praises how quickly Brown matured as a storyteller {{over the course of}} The Playboy, and for the believability of scenes {{which may or may not}} have happened as Brown depicted them. [...] While seeming to acknowledge feminist concerns, Brown depicts himself as [...] "a victim of his urges", and that [...] "Playboy has kept him mentally separate". [...] Sullivan asserts the book shows that pornography does not merely satisfy a need, but fosters an addiction. [...] Brown's comics raise questions, rather than trying to <b>answer</b> <b>them,</b> an approach Sullivan compared favourably to that of Joe Matt's less subtle body of work, which also details a pornography obsession: he wrote that Matt's comics analyze and rationalize his obsession, while Brown's reveal.|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics of}} Lukashenko, {{including}} the opposition group Zubr, {{use the term}} Lukashism {{to refer to the}} political and economic system Lukashenko has implemented in Belarus. The term is also used more broadly to refer to an authoritarian ideology based on a cult of his personality and nostalgia for Soviet times among certain groups in Belarus. [...] The US Congress sought to aid the opposition groups by passing the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 to introduce sanctions against Lukashenko's government and provide financial and other support to the opposition. Lukashenko supporters argue that his rule spared Belarus the turmoil that beset many other former Soviet countries. Lukashenko commented on the criticism of him by saying: [...] "I've been hearing these accusations for over 10years and we have got used to it. We are not going to <b>answer</b> <b>them.</b> I want to come from the premise that the elections in Belarus are held for ourselves. I am sure that it is the Belarusian people who are the masters in our state." ...|$|E

500|$|The Gravemind {{makes his}} first {{appearance}} halfway through Halo 2s campaign. Using his tentacles to save the Master Chief and Arbiter from perishing, Gravemind brings them face to face in a chasm on Delta Halo. Gravemind reveals to the Arbiter that the ring's architects, the Forerunners, died when they activated the installation {{in order to stop}} the threat of the Flood; the Master Chief verifies what the creature says, having stopped the firing of another ring in [...] Though the Arbiter does not accept the truth immediately, Gravemind sends the Master Chief to the Covenant city High Charity and the Arbiter to the Halo's control room in order to stop the deluded Covenant from killing all sentient life a second time. Though he promises an alliance, Gravemind has ulterior motives. His Flood infest the human ship In Amber Clad and makes a slipspace jump into High Charity itself, in an effort to use the station to escape the confines of Halo. Having taken over the city, Gravemind questions the A.I. Cortana, who was left behind to destroy High Charity if Halo was activated. Gravemind says that he has questions that he will ask, and Cortana agrees to <b>answer</b> <b>them.</b> A short story in the 2009 Halo: Evolutions anthology details the conversations that follow.|$|E
500|$|The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy {{called the}} film's visuals vivid, stunning, and {{magnificent}} on a technical level, and praised {{the performances of}} Fassbender, Rapace, and Theron, but wrote that the film [...] "caters too much to imagined audience expectations when a little more adventurous thought might have taken it to some excitingly unsuspected destinations." [...] Time Out Londons Tom Huddleston wrote that [...] "the photography is pleasingly crisp and the design is stunning", but that, [...] "he script feels flat... the dialogue is lazy, while the plot, though crammed with striking concepts, simply fails to coalesce. After an enjoyable setup, the central act is baggy, confusing and, in places, slightly boring, while the climax has flash and fireworks but no real momentum." [...] Emanuel Levy wrote that the writing was his only complaint about the film, which, he said, [...] "is not only uneven, but promises more original ideas and thematic provocations than it can possibly deliver." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, labeling it a [...] "seamless blend of story, special effects and pitch-perfect casting, filmed in sane, effective 3-D that doesn't distract." [...] Ebert wrote that Rapace's performance [...] "continues here the tradition of awesome feminine strength begun by Sigourney Weaver in Alien", but considered that Elba's Janek has the most interesting character evolution. Ebert thought that the plot raises questions and does not <b>answer</b> <b>them,</b> which made the film intriguing and parallel to the [...] "classic tradition of golden age sci-fi". He later went on to name {{it as one of}} the best films of 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{example of}} barbarism perpetrated by the Yorkists is {{the abuse of}} Clifford's body in Act 2, Scene 6, where Edward, Richard, Clarence and Warwick all speak to the corpse in derision, sardonically {{wondering}} why it doesn't <b>answer</b> <b>them.</b> Richard's treatment of Henry's body in the final scene {{is another example of}} the lack of reverence for the dead; after Henry's death, Richard stabs the corpse, proclaiming [...] "Down, down to hell, and say I sent thee hither" [...] (5.6.67).|$|E
2500|$|Likewise, Perutz saw [...] "no harm" [...] {{in showing}} an MRC report {{containing}} {{the conclusions of}} Franklin and Gosling's X-ray data analysis to Crick, since {{it had not been}} marked as confidential, although [...] "The report was not expected to reach outside eyes". Indeed, after the publication of Watson's The Double Helix exposed Perutz's act, he received so many letters questioning his judgment that he felt the need to both <b>answer</b> <b>them</b> all and to post a general statement in Science excusing himself on the basis of being [...] "inexperienced and casual in administrative matters".|$|E
