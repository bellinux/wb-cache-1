5|$|To {{identify}} the optimal {{spatial and temporal}} distribution of radiation sources within the applicators of the implanted tissue or cavity, the treatment planning software allows virtual radiation sources to be placed within the virtual patient. The software shows a graphical representation {{of the distribution of}} the irradiation. This serves as a guide for the brachytherapy team to refine the distribution of the sources and provide a treatment plan that is optimally tailored to the anatomy of each patient before <b>actual</b> <b>delivery</b> of the irradiation begins. This approach is sometimes called ‘dose-painting’.|$|E
5|$|At Auschwitz, the <b>actual</b> <b>delivery</b> of gas to {{the victims}} was always handled by the SS, {{on the order of}} the supervising SS doctor. Many of the SS doctors also {{conducted}} inhumane medical experiments on camp prisoners. The most infamous SS doctor, Josef Mengele, served as a medical officer at Auschwitz under the command of Eduard Wirths of the camp's medical corps. Mengele undertook selections even when he was not assigned {{to do so in the}} hope of finding subjects for his experiments. He was particularly interested in locating sets of twins. In contrast to most of the doctors, who viewed undertaking selections as one of their most stressful and horrible duties, Mengele undertook the task with a flamboyant air, often smiling or whistling a tune. After the war, many SS doctors were charged with war crimes for their inhumane medical experiments and for their role in gas chamber selections.|$|E
50|$|COTS must be {{distinguished}} from the related Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) program. COTS relates {{to the development of}} the vehicles, CRS to the <b>actual</b> <b>deliveries.</b> COTS involves a number of Space Act Agreements, with NASA providing milestone-based payments.|$|R
50|$|There is the {{difficulty}} inherent for any periodic monitoring of synchronizing data timing: <b>actual</b> <b>deliveries,</b> <b>actual</b> invoicing, {{and the date}} the EVM analysis is done are all independent, so that some items have arrived but their invoicing has not {{and by the time}} analysis is delivered the data will likely be weeks behind events.

5|$|SS {{officers}} {{told the}} victims {{they were to}} take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The <b>actual</b> <b>delivery</b> of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could still be heard over the engines.|$|E

25|$|The human OFC {{is among}} the least-understood regions of the human brain; {{but it has been}} {{proposed}} that the OFC is involved in sensory integration, in representing the affective value of reinforcers, and in decision-making and expectation. In particular, the OFC seems to be important in signaling the expected rewards/punishments of an action given the particular details of a situation. In doing this, the brain is capable of comparing the expected reward/punishment with the <b>actual</b> <b>delivery</b> of reward/punishment, thus, making the OFC critical for adaptive learning. This is supported by research in humans, non-human primates, and rodents. Human research has focused on neuroimaging research in healthy participants and neuropsychology research in patients with damage to discrete parts of the OFC. Research at the University of Leipzig shows that the human OFC is activated during intuitive coherence judgements.|$|E

2500|$|The pre-series {{vehicles}} get {{the company}} designation Modèle 1928 or M 28 after {{the year they}} were delivered; the production vehicles are likewise named Modèle 1929 or M 29, though the <b>actual</b> <b>delivery</b> was in 1930 and 1931. The official name however, assigned in 1931, is the AMC Schneider P 16. The P 16 was thus accepted as conforming to the specifications for a wheeled AMC, or an AMC N°1, as stated [...] by the Supreme Command on 12 April 1923, although the vehicle was not specifically designed to meet them, and partially fulfilling the requirements of an AMC N°2 stated in August 1924, which asked for a tracked vehicle — as a half-track it was indeed in between. [...] "AMC" [...] stands for Automitrailleuse de Combat. Although automitrailleuse is today a synonym for [...] "armoured car", in those days it was the codename for any Cavalry armoured vehicle as the Cavalry was in 1922 forbidden by law to employ tanks. In fact their rôle was pretty much that of a main battle tank as the Cavalry would not acquire real modern guntanks until 1935; in the twenties fully tracked vehicles were, {{given the state of}} technological development, considered by the Cavalry as being either to slow or not reliable enough. [...] "P 16" [...] refers to the Panhard 16 engine. Confusingly, the pre-series vehicles only were fitted with it, while the production vehicles have the Panhard 17. In total 96 vehicles of the main series were produced, serial numbers from the range 37002 - 37168, resulting in a total of 100 vehicles.|$|E

Among others, the memory of Pope Sylvester II, was blackened with the charge of having thus bargained away his soul. All learning fell under suspicion, till at length the very grammar itself (the last volume in the world, one would say, to conjure with) gave to English the word gramary (enchantment), and in French became a book of magic, under the alias of Grimoire. It is not at all unlikely that, in an age when the boundary between actual and possible was not very well defined, there were scholars who made experiments in this direction, and signed contracts, though they {{never had a chance to}} complete their bargain by an <b>actual</b> <b>delivery.</b> I do not recall any case of witchcraft in which such a document was produced in court as evidence against the accused. Such a one, it is true, was ascribed to Grandier, but was not brought forward at his trial. It should seem that Grandier had been shrewd enough to take a bond to secure the fulfilment of the contract on the other side; for we have the document in fac-simile, signed and sealed by Lucifer, Beelzebub, Satan, Elimi, Leviathan, and Astaroth, duly witnessed by Baalberith, Secretary of the Grand Council of Demons. Fancy the competition such a state paper as this would arouse at a sale of autographs! Commonly no security appears to have been given by the other party to these arrangements but the bare word of the Devil, which was considered, no doubt, every whit as good as his bond. In most cases, indeed, he was the loser, and showed a want of capacity for affairs equal to that of an average giant of romance. Never was comedy acted over and over with such sameness of repetition as [...] "The Devil is an Ass." [...] How often must he have exclaimed (laughing in his sleeve):-- ...|$|E

The weight of the component at the central location is supported on a horizontal mounting plate that fits onto the main frame using the same fixtures. This generation of the family is also referred to as the TRAXX2E platform, the type designations themselves didn't change.

40|$|Different {{allocation}} {{and delivery}} performance ratios {{are used to}} assess operations performance {{in a large scale}} public irrigation system in Indonesia. Results from this analysis indicate that field management practices deviate substantially from the official operating procedures. The lack of application of a single, standardized procedure for planning water allocations is a serious constraint to effective monitoring and evaluating system performance. Underestimated and unrealistic planned allocations becomes the justification for overdiversion of water, and undermines the resolve of managers to reconcile actual and planned flows. Miscalculating planned allocations, poor matches between planned flows and <b>actual</b> <b>deliveries,</b> overdiversion and misreporting have economic consequences. For example, strict adherence to the standard operating rule during the second dry season of 1987 would have resulted in 19 [*] 070 [*] 000 m³ less water diverted into the irrigation system from the Brantas River or, at a conservative estimate of $ 1. 78 per 100 m³ water, a saving of $ 339 [*] 500.

Also, some howitzers were captured in April 1941 from Kingdom of Yugoslavia and designated 22 cm Mörser 538(j). Finally, 7 howitzers were captured by Soviet Union from Poland and were re-used against Finland during the Winter War. Army of Czechoslovakia has also considered adopting gun, but the plans were abandoned.
