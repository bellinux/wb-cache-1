50|$|Boodles {{is known}} for its {{distinctive}} floral nose and lingering juniper flavor, with a clean finish. It contains a blend of nine botanicals: juniper, coriander seed, angelica root, <b>angelica</b> <b>seed,</b> cassia bark, caraway seed, nutmeg, rosemary and sage. It is made in a vacuum still, a process that allows the gin to retain more of the flavors of its botanicals. It is the only gin to contain nutmeg, rosemary and sage among its botanicals. Unlike other London Dry gins, Boodles contains no citrus ingredients.|$|E
40|$|Current {{monitoring}} {{methods for}} walnut husk flies (WHFs), Rhagoletis completa Cresson, (Diptera: Tephritidae), a major pest of commercial walnuts, are ineffective at predicting {{the onset of}} damage, since the initiation of oviposition is determined by walnut phenology, and not fly population levels. The {{purpose of this study}} was to initiate the development of a new monitoring lure for WHFs by identifying walnut leaf volatiles that are kairomonally attractive to WHFs. One laboratory and three field experiments were undertaken to test the hypothesis that walnut volatiles are selectively attractive to the flies. Laboratory electroantennogram (EAG) experiments were performed to record WHF responses to three groups of volatile compounds: seven monoterpenes and four sesquiterpenes found in walnut leaves and husks, and nine aliphatic green leaf volatiles. The aliphatic compounds elicited the largest EAG responses, with 8 of 9 of the aliphatics ranked in the top 10 of 21 compounds tested. The monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes elicited weaker absolute EAG responses, but in relation to their lower volatility, they were assessed as strong EAG stimulants. Our interpretation of the EAG results suggested that monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes should be included in field attractancy tests. A blend of monoterpenes and a blend of sesquiterpenes, similar in proportions to walnut leaf headspace concentrations, were field tested, with both blends being significantly more attractive than the control. The second field experiment was conducted to elucidate which components of a previously suggested male WHF attractant, <b>angelica</b> <b>seed</b> oil (ASOil) (Angelica archangelica), are attractive. Distilled fractions of ASOil, along with crude ASOil were tested. Only one fraction was significantly attractive, a fraction composed predominantly of sesquiterpenes high in both alphacopaene (a known medfly, Ceratitis capitata, attractant) and caryophyllene, a sesquiterpene found in walnut headspace. The final set of field experiments tested individual walnut headspace sesquiterpenes (caryophyllene, beta-farnesene, alpha-farnesene and germacrene D) and the one attractive ASOil fraction. Caryophyllene, a common plant volatile, was more attractive than any other test lure, including germacrene D, a more walnut-specific volatile. This is the first report of a host-plant based volatile attractant for WHFs. The attractant, caryophyllene, captured primarily male WHFs (approximately 3 : 1, male:female). The impact of these studies may lead to a new WHF monitoring tool that might be predictive of the onset of walnut damage by ovipositing females. The lead-time provided by a predictive lure will help walnut growers reduce WHF damage by accurately timing their spray applications, thus treating their orchards less often, and with less adverse environmental impact...|$|E
50|$|After {{the almost}} instant {{success of the}} gin, it was soon made the James Burrough Company’s {{flagship}} product. The original Beefeater recipe book dated 1895, specifies that nine botanicals are essential (juniper, <b>angelica</b> root, <b>angelica</b> <b>seeds,</b> coriander seeds, liquorice, almonds, orris root, seville oranges and lemon peel) to create the full-bodied and robust flavour so distinct in this gin.|$|R
50|$|According to the Beefeater website, Beefeater Gin {{contains}} {{nine different}} botanicals: juniper, <b>angelica</b> root, <b>angelica</b> <b>seeds,</b> coriander seeds, liquorice, almonds, orris root, seville oranges, and lemon peel. Unique to Beefeater’s production is the steeping of the peel of lemons and Seville oranges, whole juniper berries {{and other natural}} botanicals for a full 24 hours prior to distillation. This long process allows for a full extraction of flavour from the botanicals, capturing {{a wide range of}} volatile oils. The distillation itself takes around eight hours to complete, overseen by master distiller Desmond Payne - with the spirit then taken to Scotland where it is blended and bottled at 40% ABV.|$|R

40|$|Warburg’s Tincture was a {{blockbuster}} antifever remedy in the 19 th century. It {{was invented by}} Dr Carl Warburg to treat {{a broad range of}} fevers, achieving widespread usage in the British Empire, the Austrian Empire, and also in the United States. Many renowned physicians prescribed it, but others were envious of Warburg’s success and not too happy {{about the fact that he}} kept its formulation secret. In 1870, Warburg finally revealed the secret ingredients and gave permission to Professor W. C.

40|$|Background: The {{number of}} {{antiviral}} studies using plant extracts {{has increased in}} the last decades, and the results have shown that plants are potential sources of compounds {{that are able to}} inhibit and/or decrease viral infections. The selection of these plants by ethnopharmacological criteria increases the probability of finding new substances with significant pharmacological and biological activities. Hence, Brazil has an advantage in this area due to its extensive biodiversity and ethnological diversity. Guettarda angelica is a plant from the Brazilian Caatinga region the roots of which are popularly used for various therapeutic purposes, including veterinary use. The aim of this work was to investigate the in vitro antiviral activity of extracts of plant parts from G. angelica against three animal herpesviruses: bovine (BoHV- 1), suid (SuHV- 1) and equine (EHV- 1) herpesviruses type 1. Materials, Methods & Results: The extracts of roots, leaves and <b>seeds</b> of G. <b>angelica</b> were initially screened for in vitro antiviral activity against these herpesviruses using the virus yield reduction assay. The MDBK cells were used in assays with BoHV- 1 and SuHV- 1, and the Vero cells with EHV- 1. For these assays, the cells previously treated with the extracts in non-cytotoxic concentrations were inoculated with logarithmic dilutions of each virus, The viral inhibitory activity of extracts was calculated by difference of virus titer between treated infected cells and non-treated infected cells. Only the aqueous extract from seeds (AEs) showed a significant antiviral activity (P < 0. 01, ANOVA followed by Tukey test) against all herpesviruses leading continuous studies, Thus, the selectivity index (SI) of this extract was determined by MTT [3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide] colorimetric assay by calculating the ratio CC(50) over IC 50. The 50 % cytotoxic concentration (CC 50) was defined as the extract concentration that reduced the cell viability by 50 % when compared to untreated controls; the 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) was defined as the concentration of the extract that inhibited 50 % of viral replication when compared to the virus control. The CC 50 and IC 50 obtained from nonlinear regression analysis of concentration-effect curves by the GraphPad Prism 5 Demo program and represented the means +/- standard deviation of three independent experiments. The CC 5 (0) for Vero cells was 400. 60 +/- 0. 20 mu g/mL, while the CC 50 for MDBK cells was 920. 50 +/- 0. 19 mu g/mL. The IC 50 values of the AEs on the BoHV- 1, SuHV- 1 and EHV- 1 were 22. 79 mu g/mL, 91. 30 mu g/mL and 19. 95 mu g/mL, respectively. The SI values of this extract for each virus obtained from these data were 40. 39, 10. 08 and 20. 08 for BoHV- 1, SuHV- 1, and EHV- 1, respectively. Discussion: To ensure the antiviral activity of a plant extract and consequently its future use as antiviral agent is crucial the obtainment of its selectivity index or safety index. It is guarantee of a true antiviral effect and not the result of cytotoxicity of the extract on cells, and that could be confused with an antiviral activity. Other important point are the extract IC 50 values less than 100 mu g/mL. The results of the AEs of G. angelica are in accordance with these considerations indicating that the Go <b>angelica</b> <b>seeds</b> may be a potential source of antiviral compounds insurance and encouraging further investigation of them...|$|R
40|$|The first {{triangular}} browning umbels {{caused by}} Diaporthe <b>angelicae</b> on carrot <b>seed</b> crops {{were observed in}} France in 2007. This fungal phytopathogen negatively impacted carrot seed production. Little is known about this fungus. In order to control it in carrot seed production, {{a better understanding of}} its life cycle and its epidemiology is required. So, this is the reason why a three-years research project named DIAPOCAR was initiated in 2012. It appears that flower is the main sensitive organ and flowering the most sensitive stage of the umbel. In the field, contaminations are particularly observed during flowering of the umbels of order I and II if the weather is favourable to disease. Field fungicide trials show significant efficacy differences between fungicides and only three of them are efficient against carrot phomopsis. Finally, model simulations with the sunflower phomopsis model are promising and this tool to aid decision-making can be used to apply fungicides only when the weather is favourable to the disease. It should help carrot seed growers to determine the best timing for fungicide applications. Thus, a greater understanding of the biology of this fungus has led to a better control of phomopsis on carrot seed crops...|$|R
50|$|Items {{are placed}} on this spread: a Mirror (of fate), two Candelabras (representing {{the bride and groom}} and their bright future), a tray of seven multi-colored herbs and spices (including poppy <b>seeds,</b> wild rice, <b>angelica,</b> salt, nigella <b>seeds,</b> black tea, and frankincense). These herbs and spices play {{specific}} roles ranging from breaking spells and witchcraft, to blinding the evil eye, to burning evil spirits. In addition to these herbs/spices, a special baked and decorated flatbread, a basket of decorated eggs, decorated almonds, walnuts and hazelnuts (in their shell to represent fertility), a basket of pomegranates/apples (for a joyous future as these fruits are considered divine), a cup of rose water (from special Persian roses)—which helps perfume the air, a bowl made out of sugar (apparently to sweeten life for the newlywed couple), and a brazier holding burning coals and sprinkled with wild rue (as a way to keep the evil eye away and to purify the wedding ritual) {{are placed on}} the spread as well. Finally, there are additional items that must be placed on the spread, including a bowl of gold coins (to represent wealth and prosperity), a scarf/shawl made of silk/fine fabric (to be held over the bride and groom’s head at certain points in the ceremony), two sugar cones—which are ground above the bride and groom's head, thus symbolizing sweetness/happiness, a cup of honey (to sweeten life), a needle and seven strands of colored thread (the shawl that is held above the bride and groom’s head is sewn together with the string throughout the ceremony), and a copy of the couple’s Holy Book (other religions require different texts); but all of these books symbolize God's blessing for the couple.An early age in marriage—especially for brides—is a long documented feature of marriage in Iran. While the people of Iran have been trying to legally change this practice by implementing a higher minimum in marriage, there have been countless blocks to such an attempt. Although the average age of women being married has increased by about five years in the past couple decades, young girls being married is still common feature of marriage in Iran—even though there is an article in the Iranian Civil Code that forbid the marriage of women younger than 15 years of age and males younger than 18 years of age.|$|R
