5|$|A common {{justification}} for the need for astronomy {{is the need to}} develop an accurate calendar for agricultural reasons. Ancient texts like Hesiod's Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this. Instead astronomical observations are used in combination with ecological signs, such as bird migrations to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical work with the Mursi of Ethiopia shows that haphazard astronomy continued until recent times {{in some parts of the}} world. All the same, calendars <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} time in Spain, in April 1616 Hasekura met again with the King, who {{declined}} to sign a trade agreement, on the ground that the Japanese Embassy did not <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> official embassy from the ruler of Japan Tokugawa Ieyasu, who, on the contrary, had promulgated an edict in January 1614 ordering the expulsion of all missionaries from Japan, and started the persecution of the Christian faith in Japan.|$|E

After rehearsals and the shooting, Mizoguchi lit a {{cigarette}} for Mori, indicating his rare degree of satisfaction with the scene. Eitaro Ozawa, who played Tōbei, said the actors frequently rehearsed alone, or with the cinematographer, while Mizoguchi was willingly absent during these preparations.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} {{view of the}} A. C. Burrage {{residence in}} Redlands, ca. 1900. This large light-colored, mission revival-style residence, at center, has two large bell towers, at least five chimneys, a row of arches framing what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> wrap-around porch, and glass gazebo to the far right. In the foreground dozens of trees obscure what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> driveway leading <b>to</b> the residence.

5|$|The {{position}} of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the European or American robins but <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> early offshoot of the Passerida group of songbirds. The flame robin is predominantly insectivorous, pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A territorial bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by BirdLife International as Near Threatened, the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to European or American robins but <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> early offshoot of the songbird infraorder Passerida. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird and its prey consists of insects and spiders. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} rodent are monogamous, {{with an adult}} male and female forming a lasting pair bond. Monogamy can come in two forms; obligate and facultative. In obligate monogamy, both parents care for the {{offspring}} and play {{an important part in}} their survival. This occurs in species such as California mice, oldfield mice, Malagasy giant rats and beavers. In these species, males usually mate only with their partners. In addition to increased care for young, obligate monogamy can also be beneficial to the adult male as it decreases the chances of never finding a mate or mating with an infertile female. In facultative monogamy, the males do not provide direct parental care and stay with one female because they cannot access others due to being spatially dispersed. Prairie voles <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> example of this form of monogamy, with males guarding and defending females within their vicinity.|$|E

5|$|While {{the cause}} of Crohn's disease is unknown it is {{believed}} to be due to a combination of environmental, immune and bacterial factors in genetically susceptible individuals. It results in a chronic inflammatory disorder, in which the body's immune system attacks the gastrointestinal tract possibly directed at microbial antigens. While Crohn's is an immune related disease, it does not <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> autoimmune disease (in that the immune system is not being triggered by the body itself). The exact underlying immune problem is not clear; however, it may be an immunodeficiency state. About half of the overall risk is related to genetics with more than 70 genes found to be involved.|$|E

25|$|Poor health {{outcomes}} <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> effect of economic inequality across a population. Nations and regions with greater economic inequality show poorer outcomes in life expectancy, mental health, drug abuse, obesity, educational performance, teenage birthrates, and ill health due to violence. On an international level, {{there is a}} positive correlation between developed countries with high economic equality and longevity. This is unrelated to average income per capita in wealthy nations. Economic gain only impacts life expectancy to a great degree in countries in which the mean per capita annual income is less than approximately $25,000.|$|E
25|$|Based on DNA {{sequences}} {{from the}} nuclear ribosomal {{internal and external}} transcribed spacers, Danish botanist Nina Rønsted and colleagues rejected previous subdivisions of the Malvanthera. Instead, they divided section Malvanthera into three subsections—Malvantherae, Platypodeae and Hesperidiiformes. In this system, the Moreton Bay fig is in the new subsection Malvantherae, along with F. pleurocarpa. The Malvantherae <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> early offshoot and basal to the group. Both forms are native to Australia, with form columnaris of macrophylla having colonised Lord Howe Island. Ronsted and colleagues suggest this last form {{might be the most}} ancient of the three taxa. The section Malvanthera itself is thought to have evolved 41 million years ago and radiated from 35 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Short gamma-ray bursts <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> exception. Until 2007, only {{a handful}} of these events have been {{localized}} to a definite galactic host. However, those that have been localized appear to show significant differences from the long-burst population. While at least one short burst has been found in the star-forming central region of a galaxy, several others have been associated with the outer regions and even the outer halo of large elliptical galaxies in which star formation has nearly ceased. All the hosts identified so far have also been at low redshift. Furthermore, despite the relatively nearby distances and detailed follow-up study for these events, no supernova has been associated with any short GRB.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{physiological}} role of calpains is still poorly understood, {{they have been}} shown to be active participants in processes such as cell mobility and cell cycle progression, as well as cell-type specific functions such as long-term potentiation in neurons and cell fusion in myoblasts. Under these physiological conditions, a transient and localized influx of calcium into the cell activates a small local population of calpains (for example, those close to Ca2+ channels), which then advance the signal transduction pathway by catalyzing the controlled proteolysis of its target proteins. Other reported roles of calpains are in cell function, helping to regulate clotting and the diameter of blood vessels, and playing a role in memory. Calpains have been implicated in apoptotic cell death, and <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> essential component of necrosis. Detergent fractionation revealed the cytosolic localization of calpain.|$|E
25|$|Rodriguez {{played his}} first rehab {{assignment}} game on July 2, 2013 with the Yankees Class-A Low affiliate, the Charleston RiverDogs. He continued his rehabilitation and {{played for the}} Yankees Triple-A team, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders on July 18. Two days prior to his scheduled promotion to the major league roster, Rodriguez sustained a new injury, as an MRI later revealed a Grade 1 quad strain, delaying his return and forcing him to continue rehabilitating in the minor leagues. Rodriguez independently sought a second opinion on his quad strain on July 24 with a doctor who stated that there did not <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> injury; the Yankees were incensed by his decision, saying that he violated league rules for seeking a second opinion without the team's permission. He completed his rehabilitation program with the Yankees' Double-A affiliate Trenton Thunder.|$|E
25|$|Of this material, {{only the}} {{quadrate}} and orbital roof, {{in addition to}} limited portions of the braincase are preserved with enough fidelity to permit any definitive interpretation. The quadrates of TTU P 9200 and TTU P 9201 are not particularly alike; a fact not easily explained away if the material is conspecific, as Chatterjee insists. There does not <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> orbital process present on either bone, and the modifications of the proximal condyle permitting wide range of motion against the squamosal, are not readily apparent. Furthermore, the quadratojugal and jugal appear far more robust in the Protoavis specimens themselves, than represented by Chatterjee. The size {{and development of the}} quadratojugal seems to contradict Chatterjee's assertion that this bone contacted the quadrate via a highly mobile pin joint. These data render the assertion of prokinesis in the skull of Protoavis questionable at best, and it seems most parsimonious to conclude that the specimen displays a conventional opisthostylic quadrate.|$|E

25|$|According to the Khalimpur {{copper plate}} inscription, the first Pala king Gopala {{was the son}} of a warrior named Vapyata. The Ramacharitam attests that Varendra (North Bengal) was the {{fatherland}} (Janakabhu) of the Palas. The ethnic origins of the dynasty are unknown, although the later records claim that Gopala was a Kshatriya belonging to the legendary solar dynasty. The Ballala-Carita states that the Palas were Kshatriyas, a claim reiterated by Taranatha in his History of Buddhism in India as well as Ghanaram Chakrabarty in his Dharmamangala (both written in the 16th century CE). The Ramacharitam also attests the fifteenth Pala emperor, Ramapala, as a Kshatriya. Claims of belonging to the mythical solar dynasty are unreliable and clearly <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> attempt to cover up the humble origins of the dynasty. The Pala dynasty has also been branded as Śudra in some sources such as Manjushri-Mulakalpa; this might be because of their Buddhist leanings. According to Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak (in Ain-i-Akbari), the Palas were Kayasthas. There are even accounts that claim Gopala may have been from a Brahmin lineage.|$|E
25|$|So proto-insects had to {{specialize}} and focus their whole existence on improving a single lifestyle {{in a particular}} niche. The older the species and the single individuals became, the more would they differ from their original form as they adapted to their new lifestyles better than the generations before. The final body-structure was no longer achieved while still inside the egg, but continued to develop for most of a lifetime, causing a bigger difference between the youngest and oldest individuals. Assuming that mature individuals most likely mastered their new element better than did the nymphs who had the same lifestyle, it would <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> advantage if the immature members of the species reached adult shape and form as soon as possible. This may explain why they evolved fewer but more intense instars and a stronger focus on the adult body, and with greater differences between the adults and the first instars, instead of just gradually growing bigger as earlier generations had done. This evolutionary trend explains how they went from ametabolous to hemimetabolous insects.|$|E
25|$|Lynne contributed many {{songs to}} the Move's last two albums while formulating, with Roy Wood and Bev Bevan, a band {{built around a}} fusion of rock and {{classical}} music, with the original idea of both bands existing in tandem. This project would eventually become the highly successful Electric Light Orchestra (ELO). Problems led to Wood's departure in 1972, after the band's eponymous first album, leaving Lynne as the band's dominant creative force. Thereafter followed a succession of band personnel changes and increasingly popular albums: 1973's ELO 2 and On the Third Day, 1974's Eldorado and 1975's Face the Music. By 1976's A New World Record, Lynne had almost developed {{the roots of the}} group into a more complex and unique pop-rock sound mixed with studio strings, layered vocals, and tight, catchy pop singles. Lynne's now almost complete creative dominance as producer, songwriter, arranger, lead singer and guitarist could make ELO <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> almost solo effort. However, the ELO sound and the focus of Lynne's writing was also shaped by Louis Clark's and Richard Tandy's co-arranging, under Lynne's direction (notably the large string sections), Bev Bevan's drumming, and Richard Tandy's integration of the Moog, harmonium, and Mellotron, with more novel keyboard technology, gave Lynne's songs a more symphonic sound. Kelly Groucutt's distinctive voice mixed with Lynne's to produce the classic ELO harmonic vocal sound.|$|E
