The songs are <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>forgotten.</b> While I {{have no regrets}} regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate {{the idea of doing}} things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E
5|$|Steinbeck {{was right}} about the lack of popular appeal, however: the unusual mixture of taxonomic data and travelogue meant the book {{struggled}} to find an audience. Few copies were printed and it was soon <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>forgotten.</b> The country's entry into the war and plummeting book sales also had an effect. Ricketts' share of the revenues from sales did not even provide him with the money to pay back Steinbeck for financing the journey.|$|E

5|$|Clarke {{composed}} no {{large scale}} {{works such as}} symphonies. Her total output of compositions comprises 52 songs, 11 choral works, 21 chamber pieces, the Piano Trio, and the Viola Sonata. Her work was <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>forgotten</b> {{for a long period}} of time, but interest in it was revived in 1976 following a radio broadcast in celebration of her ninetieth birthday. Over half of Clarke's compositions remain unpublished and in the personal possession of her heirs, along with most of her writings. However, in the early 2000s more of her works were printed and recorded. Examples of recent publications include two string quartets and Morpheus, published in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Several {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} rongorongo {{may have been an}} invention inspired by this visit and the signing of the treaty of annexation. As circumstantial evidence, they note that no explorer reported the script prior to Eugène Eyraud in 1864, and are of the opinion that the marks with which the chiefs signed the Spanish treaty do not resemble rongorongo. The hypothesis of these researchers is not that rongorongo was itself a copy of the Latin alphabet, or of any other form of writing, but that the concept of writing had been conveyed in a process anthropologists term trans-cultural diffusion, which then inspired the islanders to invent their own system of writing. If this is the case, then rongorongo emerged, flourished, fell into oblivion, and was <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>forgotten</b> within a span of less than a hundred years.|$|E

Many apprentices and journeymen exposed to this distinctive style by serving {{a stint in}} the Phyfe shop or by copying the master cabinetmaker's designs helped to create and sustain this local school of cabinetmaking. Demand for Phyfe's work reached its peak between 1805 and 1820, although he remained a dominant figure in the trade until 1847, when he retired at the age of seventy-seven. Within the short span of a single generation, however, the work of the master was <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>forgotten</b> until the revival in the 1920s, when different furniture companies replicated his designs for several decades.|$|E

It was not until November 12, 1982 that Claude Dubois who was considered one of the driving forces of the family’s crime empire was convicted of the 1973 murder of Cotroni’s brother-in-law and was locked away for 25 years basically resulting in the fall of the Dubois Brothers. By the mid 1980s the Brothers had lost their empire and were split up with some behind bars and some laying low.

5000|$|On September 22, 1964, Mostel opened as Tevye in the {{original}} Broadway production of Fiddler on the Roof.

Unlike the majority of the townsfolk, Startsev does not take this acme of the local cultural life seriously, yet Kotik, full of charm, naivety and youthful spirits, easily conquers his heart.

They discover {{a great deal of}} food stolen by the men and large cages when the local keekees are being bred for coursing. The rat catchers return and lock up the humans, taking away the rat leader Hamnpork who had met up with them. Maurice hides and feels a voice trying to enter his mind, inciting a great sense of fear. The rats of the Clan feel it too, and many become so afraid that they <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>forget</b> how to think and reason. Dangerous Beans, the rats' spiritual leader, is crushed by the realization that the rats are just mindless animals at heart, and leaves with his assistant Peaches. Darktan, the rats' trap expert, leads a group to rescue Hamnpork, and succeeds after nearly dying in a trap. Hamnpork dies of injuries sustained while fighting in the rat coursing pit, and Darktan reluctantly assumes control of the Clan.|$|R

Before converting to Islam in the seventh or eighth century, the Malagasy clans that later intermarried with Arabs to found the Antemoro dynasty were monotheists who believed in a creator god and numerous spirits that served as intermediaries between living beings and the creator. By the time of conversion to Islam, the creator god had been <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>forgotten,</b> with much greater focus placed on the spirits, who had been raised {{to the level of}} deities.
