5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse <b>and</b> <b>addiction.</b> Drug use <b>and</b> <b>addiction</b> also {{increased significantly}} following {{the invention of the}} hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous drug users.|$|E

The authors use social construction theory to analyze the social problems of HIV/AIDS <b>and</b> <b>addictions</b> <b>and</b> make recommendations for macro-level interventions that may help curtail the dual problems of HIV <b>and</b> <b>addictions...</b>|$|R
5|$|LTP was {{discovered}} in the rabbit hippocampus by Terje Lømo in 1966 and has remained a popular subject of research since. Many modern LTP studies seek to better understand its basic biology, while others aim to draw a causal link between LTP and behavioral learning. Still others try to develop methods, pharmacologic or otherwise, of enhancing LTP to improve learning and memory. LTP is also a subject of clinical research, for example, {{in the areas of}} Alzheimer's disease <b>and</b> <b>addiction</b> medicine.|$|E
5|$|Following the reconciliation, a USA Today story {{detailed}} White's situation. Although White endured 20 flights {{for travel}} during his season at Iowa State, the Rockets' NBA schedule called for 98 flights. White {{had attempted to}} cope with travel in college through use of Benadryl and Xanax, but found both reduced his energy level, although it never showed in his statistical output. White cited that his concern for the increased number of flights and long term use {{of these types of}} medication could lead to dependence <b>and</b> <b>addiction</b> (which is common concern and a point of consensus concern regarding benzodiazepines in the medical community. White likened mental health conditions to a day-to-day physical injury in which symptoms can be dynamic and unclear, but support and policy should be adequately proactive).|$|E

40|$|Aims: Although {{relationships}} between <b>addiction</b> <b>and</b> personality have previously been explored, no study has ever simultaneously investigated the inter{{relationships between}} several behavioral <b>addictions,</b> <b>and</b> related these {{to the main}} dimensions of the five-factor model of personality. Methods: In this study, 218 university students completed questionnaires assessing seven different behavioral addictions (i. e., Facebook addiction, video game addiction, Internet addiction, exercise addiction, mobile phone <b>addiction,</b> compulsive buying, <b>and</b> study <b>addiction)</b> {{as well as an}} instrument assessing the main dimensions of the five-factor model of personality. Results: Of the 21 bivariate intercorrelations between the seven behavioral addictions, all were positive (and nine significantly). The results also showed that Neuroticism was positively associated with Internet addiction, exercise <b>addiction,</b> compulsive buying, <b>and</b> study <b>addiction,</b> Extroversion was positively associated with Facebook addiction, exercise addiction, mobile phone <b>addiction,</b> <b>and</b> compulsive buying, Openness to experience was negatively associated with Facebook <b>addiction</b> <b>and</b> mobile phone <b>addiction,</b> Agreeableness was negatively associated with Internet addiction, exercise addiction, mobile phone <b>addiction,</b> <b>and</b> compulsive buying, and Conscientiousness was negatively associated with Facebook addiction, video game <b>addiction,</b> Internet <b>addiction,</b> <b>and</b> compulsive buying and positively associated with exercise <b>addiction</b> <b>and</b> study <b>addiction.</b> Conclusions: The positive associations between the seven behavioral addictions suggest one or several underlying pathological factors.

40|$|A {{wealth of}} {{research}} indicates that cue reactivity is critical to understanding the neurobiology of nicotine <b>and</b> alcohol <b>addiction</b> <b>and</b> developing treatments. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalograph (EEG) studies have shown abnormal cue reactivity in various conditions between nicotine or alcohol addicts and the healthy. Although the causes of these abnormalities are still unclear, cultural effect can not be ignored. We conduct an review of fMRI and EEG studies about the cue reactivity in nicotine <b>and</b> alcohol <b>addiction</b> <b>and</b> highlight the cultural perspective. We suggest that cultural cue reactivity is a field worth of exploring which may {{has an effect on}} addictive behavior through emotion and attention. The cultural role of nicotine <b>and</b> alcohol <b>addiction</b> would provide new insight into understanding the mechanisms of nicotine <b>and</b> alcohol <b>addiction</b> <b>and</b> developing culture-specific therapies. We consider that culture as a context may be a kind of factor that causes confusing outcomes in the research on nicotine <b>and</b> alcohol <b>addiction</b> which makes it possible to control the cultural influences and further contribute to the more consistent results...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{examines}} (1) the associations between multiple types of child maltreatment <b>and</b> Internet <b>addiction,</b> <b>and</b> (2) the mediating effects of {{post-traumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD) on these associations. We collected data from a national proportionately stratified random sample of 6233 fourth-grade students in Taiwan in 2014. We conducted bivariate correlations and sets of multiple regression analyses to examine the associations between multiple types of maltreatment (5 types in total) <b>and</b> Internet <b>addiction,</b> <b>and</b> to identify the mediating role of PTSD. The results reveal that being male and experiencing abuse (psychological neglect, physical neglect, paternal physical violence, sexual violence) were associated with increased risk among children of developing PTSD <b>and</b> Internet <b>addiction.</b> Moreover, PTSD mediated the associations between multiple types of maltreatment (except maternal physical violence) <b>and</b> Internet <b>addiction.</b> This study demonstrates (1) the effects of multiple types of maltreatment on the PTSD <b>and</b> Internet <b>addiction</b> of children <b>and</b> (2) the importance of early prevention and intervention in addressing related public-health concerns...|$|R
