This is <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> high-pressure plasma or atmospheric-pressure plasmas are not usually used in favor of low-pressure systems.At pressures greater than 1 torr, oligomers are formed on the electrode surface, and the monomers also on the surface can dissolve them to get a low degree of polymerization forming an oily substance. At low pressures, the reactive surfaces are low in monomer and facilitate growing high molecular weight polymers.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> is a {{lot more}} {{plausible}} is the lack of solidarity from the city's Greek Christian population. Rabbi Molho spoke {{of only a handful of}} Greek Christians who saved Jews in Thessaloniki. It is reported than just 10 Jewish families found shelter in the city. This attitude of the local population, which included the Church, the city authorities and the professional associations, has been noted by several historians in the recent years. The resistance was also not very well developed at the time, and few Jews could realistically make the journey to the mountains.|$|E
25|$|The temple {{also started}} {{to develop a}} social {{dimension}} in its activities. For example, it started promoting blood donations. The temple also organized training programs for both {{the private and public}} sector, emphasizing peace and stability in society by training government officers to be more reliable. The temple also became active in promoting Buddhist scholarship and educational reform in the Sangha (monastic community), producing a CD with searchable texts of the Pali Canon in 1984, in cooperation with the Pali Text Society, Mahidol University and the University of California in Berkeley. In 1990, the temple also organized its first academic seminar Buddhism into the Year 2000, with over a hundred international scholars joining. On a more local level, the temple started to organize a yearly congratulation ceremony for Pali graduates at the highest level, and offered funds to temples that excelled at teaching Pali. The temple was known to have wide support from the Thai Sangha and was tolerated by the government, though at times the government asked the temple to limit its mass assemblies. In 1985, the Department of Religious Affairs, Ministry of Education, prohibited the building of a meditation center in the province, citing as <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> it was not accessible enough for people to visit. Fuengfusakul concludes that during this period the government was afraid of the temple's ability to gather a large number of people.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> {{our galaxy}} is {{considered}} rare by Rare Earth {{is because it}} appears to have suffered fewer collisions with other galaxies over the last 10 billion years, and its peaceful history may have made it more hospitable to complex life than galaxies which have suffered more collisions, and consequently more supernovae and other disturbances. The level of activity of the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way may also be important: {{too much or too little}} and the conditions for life may be even rarer. The Milky Way black hole appears to be just right. The orbit of the Sun around the center of the Milky Way is indeed almost perfectly circular, with a period of 226 Ma (1 Ma=1 million years), one closely matching the rotational period of the galaxy. However, the majority of stars in barred spiral galaxies populate the spiral arms rather than the halo and tend to move in gravitationally aligned orbits, so there is little that is unusual about the Sun's orbit. While the Rare Earth hypothesis predicts that the Sun should rarely, if ever, have passed through a spiral arm since its formation, astronomer Karen Masters has calculated that the orbit of the Sun takes it through a major spiral arm approximately every 100 million years. Some researchers have suggested that several mass extinctions do correspond with previous crossings of the spiral arms.|$|E

500|$|Jean-Jacques Rousseau's {{philosophical}} {{treatise on}} education, [...] (1762), {{is one of}} the major literary influences on Mary. A few months before starting the work, Wollstonecraft wrote to her sister Everina: [...] "I am now reading Rousseau's Emile, and love his paradoxes ... however he rambles into that chimerical world in which I have too often wandered ... He was a strange inconsistent unhappy clever creature—yet he possessed an uncommon portion of sensibility and penetration" [...] (emphasis Wollstonecraft's). Rousseau, she notes, [...] "chuses [...] a common capacity to educate—and gives as <b>a</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>that</b> a genius will educate itself" [...] (emphasis Wollstonecraft's). When Mary was published, the title page included a quotation from Rousseau: [...] "L'exercice des plus sublimes vertus éleve et nourrit le génie" [...] ("the exercise of the most sublime virtues raises and nourishes genius"). The novel is therefore, in many ways, an early bildungsroman, or novel of education.|$|E

The whole scenario is bathed in red and violet lights, coming from {{the windows of the}} buildings and alleyways as steam billows out from the drains. When the first verse of the song begins, Gaga emerges from the window of an apartment onto the fire escape. A long take follows, of Gaga strutting through the red-lit district singing the line [...] "I got <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> you should take me home tonight", and a shock of black hair falls in her eyes. Gaga does not remove it and the shot spans to her walking backside, gesturing the viewer to follow. The video consists mostly of interchanging shots of Gaga dancing and singing on the street, on the fire escape, and on the steps in front of the apartment building with Clemons. Near the end of the video, after Clemons' saxophone solo, Gaga crouches in front of the building's steps and kisses the sidewalk. The video concludes with a close-up of Gaga's face, before she re-enters through the window into her smokey apartment.|$|E
