5|$|Ten years later, Rohan (Hrithik Roshan) {{returns home}} from {{boarding}} school and accidentally overhears a conversation from his grandmothers (Achala Sachdev and Sushma Seth) concerned Rahul's adoption <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> Rahul left home, whereupon Rohan vows to reunite the family. He learns that Rahul, Anjali, {{and her younger}} sister Pooja (with whom he shared a playful relationship during his childhood) moved to London, and tells his parents that he wishes to pursue further studies in London. Yash is skeptical at first, but once Rohan emphasizes that he is following the family traditions, his parents agree to let him go. In London, Rahul and Anjali now have their own son, Krish. Pooja (Kareena Kapoor), now a popular fashion-obsessed diva, is a student at King's College London, where Rohan enrolls. He and Pooja meet again and he tells her that {{he has come to}} London to bring his brother and sister-in-law back home. Pooja tells Rahul that Rohan is her friend's brother who currently has nowhere to stay. After some persuasion, Rahul agrees to let Rohan stay as Rohan uses the name 'Yash' to hide his real identity. Right before the family attends Krish's school functin, Sayeeda and Anjali find out his real identity, though they promise to keep quiet. At Krish's school function, Krish leads his class in singing Jana Gana Mana (Indian national anthem), and later recites advice which Rohan had given him. Rahul, having given Rohan this advice ten years ago, now realizes that Rohan is his brother.|$|E

Gay, Straight, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reason</b> <b>Why</b> received numerous positive reviews, praising it for LeVay's wide-ranging overview of scientific research on sexual orientation, but the book also received some mixed or negative reviews, criticizing it on grounds such as LeVay's willingness to rely on studies with inadequate sample sizes.

25|$|The {{equality}} {{of men and}} women is a fundamental Bahá'í principle, that is explicit in the writings of Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, and particularly in the writings and discourses of `Abdu'l-Bahá, his son and chosen interpreter. The teaching and its vision of the community is central to Bahá'í community life as is implemented at a practical level. The Bahá'í teachings state that women are not inferior to men, and should not be subordinate to men in aspects of social life. In the Bahá'í view, women have always been equal to men, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> women have so far not achieved this equality is {{due to the lack of}} adequate educational and social opportunities, and because men have used their greater physical strength to prevent women from developing their true potential.|$|E

It is traditionally served with Madeira Sauce. As a lightly smoked, dry-cured ham, York ham is saltier but milder in flavour than other European dry-cured hams.

500|$|The {{historian}} Laurie Guy {{observed that}} Sexual Preference relied on adult recollection of childhood, {{a type of}} evidence that had been criticized by Gagnon and Simon {{as long ago as}} 1973. Guy argued that gay rights organizations in New Zealand over-relied upon the work in the debate that preceded the passage of the Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986, writing that while important, it was only one study, and as such did not support gay rights activist claims that [...] "all evidence" [...] shows that sexual orientation is fixed early in life. The neuroscientist Simon LeVay wrote in Gay, Straight, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reason</b> <b>Why</b> (2010) that statistical studies support Freud′s view that on average gay men are more likely than straight men to describe their relationships with their mothers as close and their relationships with their fathers as distant or hostile; he cited Bell et al. in support of this claim.|$|E
