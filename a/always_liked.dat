With a game, the fourth, fifth, sixth, 80th, 100 millionth time you've seen that joke it becomes not funny, then you lose faith in it, {{and then you}} {{question}} it, and you go round this emotional circle...We've <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> fresh-baked stuff a little better but, with a video game, it doesn't work that way. But the game isn't just a collection of funny South Park scenes, hopefully it's more than that.|$|E

25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I <b>always</b> <b>liked,</b> the kind of comic books I <b>always</b> <b>liked,</b> were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

After they did, he devoted time to Heather, playing with her, reading her stories, and drawing cartoons with her. He sang her to sleep at bedtime.|$|E
25|$|Early {{correspondence}} {{shows that}} he <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> school, and was always seeking meaning—seeking {{to do something with}} his life. In 1876, he had the chance to attend high school in Columbus, Wisconsin, which had opened that year. Like many youth, he struggled with what to do with his life. After attending a year of high school, he began to teach at a Hampden school, while continuing his studies. In 1879, he attended college at the Oshkosh Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh). He left there after only one year due to financial reasons, and took a job teaching in Columbus, Wisconsin. He hoped to earn enough money to go back to college.|$|E

Terk felt she wasn't girly enough for him. He managed to trick Tarzan into coming with him to his family so he could meet his leader. Tarzan then finds out Tublat is his leader. He showed up a few months ago and killed Gubo's original leader. Tublat and Tarzan prepare to battle, but Gubo stands up to him and reminds everyone that there is strength in numbers and the gorillas gang up on Tublat, driving him off. Gubo then steps in to take place as new leader. Terk tries her lady charms, but Gubo tells her that he <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> Terk the way she is. They both end up leaving to throw mud at warthogs.|$|E

500|$|Rock 'n' Roll Circus is a {{rock music}} album which {{includes}} numerous musical elements of electropop, J-pop, rock, pop ballad, and dance music. In {{an interview with}} Japanese magazine S Cawaii, Hamasaki said about the sound of Rock 'n' Roll Circus; [...] "... basically has a feeling of [...] "back-to-basics." [...] A feeling of Ayumi Hamasaki, and less of adventure. More digging down into the foundation. Which isn't to say I'm taking a step backward. It's about expressing my feelings on things I've <b>always</b> <b>liked,</b> but as the person I am now." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} also well-liked by the band. Mick Avory, who noted the song {{as one of}} the songs he was most proud to be {{associated}} with, said [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> 'Lola', I liked the subject. It's not like anything else. I liked it for that. We'd always take a different path". In a 1983 interview, Ray Davies said, [...] "I'm just very pleased I recorded it and more pleased I wrote it". The band revisited the [...] "Lola" [...] character in the lyrics of their 1981 song, [...] "Destroyer", a minor chart hit in America.|$|E

Largely because of Louis' early interpretation of the standards and ethics of the newspaper business, I came to look with interest and confidence on the writing fraternity ... I did receive an intensive education on this trip, and Louis Howe played a great part in this education from that time on.|$|E

500|$|NBC asked Saturday Night Live {{producer}} Lorne Michaels to add The Land of Gorch to {{the program}} to lighten its overall tone. In its initial contract for Saturday Night Live, NBC required producer Lorne Michaels, short films by comedian Albert Brooks, and Jim Henson and the Muppets. Michaels said he was pleased to be working Henson on his new show: [...] "I'd <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> and {{been a fan of}} [...] and Jim's work". He said he thought Henson's idea could support a weekly routine on the program. Henson initially called the segment [...] "Muppet Night Creatures" [...] before settling on its final name. [...] "Jim Henson and the Muppets" [...] were marketed as a regular feature of Saturday Night Live before its first episode was hosted by George Carlin.|$|E
500|$|Of his {{decision}} not to show the heist itself, Tarantino {{has said that the}} reason was initially budgetary but that he had <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> the idea of not showing it and stuck with that idea {{in order to make the}} details of the heist ambiguous. He has said that the technique allows for the realization that the film is [...] "about other things", a similar plot outline that appears in the stage play Glengarry Glen Ross and its film adaptation in which the mentioned robbery is never shown on camera. Tarantino has compared this to the work of a novelist, and has said that he wanted the film to be about something that is not seen and that he wanted it to [...] "play with a real-time clock as opposed to a movie clock ticking".|$|E
500|$|Also in 2004, Beckinsale portrayed Ava Gardner in Martin Scorsese's Howard Hughes biopic The Aviator. Scorsese {{decided to}} cast Beckinsale because, [...] "I’ve <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> her. I’ve seen all her work, and I {{was glad that}} she agreed to audition." [...] Beckinsale's {{performance}} received mixed reviews. Ken Tucker of New York Magazine said she played the part [...] "in full va-va-voom blossom" [...] while LaSalle felt that she manages [...] "to convince us that Ava {{was one of the}} great broads of all time." [...] However, Clark described it as [...] "the one performance that doesn't come off (though Beckinsale has the requisite beauty)" [...] while Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian stated that [...] "Gardner's rich, voluptuous sexiness is completely absent as Beckinsale sleepwalks through the role as if she was advertising perfume." [...] The film grossed over $213million worldwide.|$|E

500|$|The casting of {{the lead}} pair was leaked well before the {{intended}} official announcements. Gowariker cast Harman Baweja after watching the trailer of his debut film, the science fiction romance Love Story 2050 (2008). He asked Harman's father, Harry Baweja, to show him the film's rushes and was impressed with his performance, calling him the best person for the part. Following this, Priyanka Chopra, {{who had worked with}} Baweja in Love Story 2050, was cast to play all twelve of the potential brides, each related to one of the twelve zodiac signs. On casting Chopra, Gowariker said: [...] "I have <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> Priyanka's work, right from [...] She's been fabulous in all her films. So when I thought of somebody doing twelve roles I thought about her, as I thought she had the potential." [...] When Gowariker offered the film to her, Chopra instantly agreed to star in it.|$|E
500|$|Edmondson has {{discussed}} the surprised reaction he encountered upon assuming {{the role of}} Abra, stating: [...] "I'm sure people are surprised I'm in it, but I don't give a toss. I have <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> it. It's like any soap - if you watch it, you get stuck in. I love working on it." [...] He has mentioned {{that he is the}} only cast member to have been a fan of the show since its 1999 conception, that both he and his youngest daughter Freya often watch it together [...] "as a bonding exercise", and going as far as to describe the role as [...] "a dream". Commenting on his decision only ever to reprise the role of Abra on short term contracts, Edmondson has stated that: [...] "I don't think I could handle any longer. The regulars on the show work very, very hard. Basically I don't think I could do what they do and still be alive." ...|$|E
500|$|Composer Ramin Djawadi {{had been}} a fan of the {{character}} Iron Man as a child, saying that he <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> superheroes [...] "that actually don’t have any superpowers". After Favreau's previous collaborator John Debney was unavailable to score the film, Djawadi sought out the role himself. Favreau had a clear vision of heavy metal music and guitars for the project, saying that Tony Stark was more of a rock star than a traditional superhero. Djawadi subsequently composed most of the film's score on guitar, before arranging it for orchestra. Djawadi had help with arrangements and additional cues from Hans Zimmer and Remote Control Productions, [...] and Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, who makes a cameo appearance in the film, contributed guitar performances to the score. The film also features a big band-style arrangement of the Iron Man theme song from the 1966 cartoon The Marvel Super Heroes from frequent Favreau collaborators John O'Brien and Rick Boston. A soundtrack featuring Djawadi's score was released by Lions Gate Records on April 29, 2008.|$|E
