40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{increase in}} <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> {{is a concern}} for public health. The fact that the choice of dose and treatment duration can affect the selection of antibiotic-resistant mutants is becoming more evident, and an increased {{number of studies have}} used pharmacodynamic models to describe the drug exposure and pharmacodynamic breakpoints needed to minimize and predict the development of resistance. However, there remains a lack of sufficient data, and future work is needed to fully characterize these target drug concen-trations. More knowledge is also needed of drug pharmacodynamics versus bacteria with different resistance mutations and susceptibility levels. The dosing regimens should exhibit high efficacy not only against sus-ceptible wild-type bacteria but, preferably, also against mutated bacteria that may exist in low numbers in “susceptible ” populations.

Thirty six pus samples were included in the study. Samples were isolated, identified and antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed as per routine laboratory protocol. The antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of killing of eugenol were studied. Out of 36 pus samples, only 20 isolates were confirmed as S. aureus strains and 6 isolates exhibited vancomycin resistance. Eugenol successfully destroyed the vancomycin-resistant strains via reactive oxygen species generation and membrane damage. The prevalence of vancomycin resistance is increased day by day in different countries, and necessary steps to prevent the spread and emergence of resistance should be taken.

However, recent {{research suggests that the}} effect of antibiotic treatment on plasmid conjugation frequencies, and hence the spread of resistance plasmids, may have been overestimated. We addressed the question by quantifying transfer proteins and conjugation frequencies of a blaCTX−M− 1 encoding IncI 1 resistance plasmid in Escherichia coli MG 1655 in the presence and absence of therapeutically relevant concentrations of cefotaxime (CTX). Analysis of the proteome by iTRAQ labeling and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry revealed that Tra proteins were significantly up-regulated in the presence of CTX. The up-regulation of the transfer machinery was confirmed at the transcriptional level for five selected genes. The CTX treatment did not cause induction of the SOS-response as revealed by absence of significantly regulated SOS associated proteins in the proteome and no significant up-regulation of recA and sfiA genes. The frequency of plasmid conjugation, measured in an antibiotic free environment, increased significantly when the donor was pre-grown in broth containing CTX compared to growth without this drug, regardless of whether blaCTX-M- 1 was located on the plasmid or in trans on the chromosome.

In addition to their use in human healthcare, antibiotics are used in a variety of other contexts; for example, they have been widely used in an agricultural context to treat and prevent disease and promote growth in livestock. Resulting from the increased use of antibiotics is the emergence of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> - the ability of bacteria to survive exposure to <b>antibiotics.</b> <b>Antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>has</b> been described by the World Heath Organization as one of the three greatest threats to human health.

For instance, the use of selection markers that confer <b>resistance</b> to <b>antibiotics</b> in vaccine plasmids may introduce the risk of transforming the patient's microflora and spread resistance genes. Moreover, in recombinant protein production for therapeutic use, the antibiotic must be eliminated from the final product.

40|$|Amdinocillin (mecillinam) is a -lactam {{antibiotic}} {{that is used}} {{mainly for}} the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infec-tions. The objectives of this study were to identify mutations that confer amdinocillin resistance on laboratory-isolated mutants and clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and to determine why amdinocillin resistance remains rare clinically even though resis-tance is easily selected in the laboratory. Under laboratory selection, frequencies of mutation to amdinocillin resistance varied from 8 108 to 2 105 per cell, depending on the concentration of amdinocillin used during selection. Several genes have been demonstrated to give amdinocillin resistance, but here eight novel genes previously unknown to be involved in amdinocil-lin resistance were identified. These genes encode functions involved in the respiratory chain, the ribosome, cysteine biosynthe-sis, tRNA synthesis, and pyrophosphate metabolism. The clinical isolates exhibited significantly greater fitness than the labora-tory-isolated mutants and a different mutation spectrum. The cysB gene was mutated (inactivated) in all of the clinical isolates, in contrast to the laboratory-isolated mutants, where mainly other types of more costly mutations were found. Our results sug-gest that the frequency of mutation to amdinocillin resistance is high because of the large mutational target (at least 38 genes). However, the majority of these resistant mutants have a low growth rate, reducing the probability that they are stably main-tained in the bladder.

40|$|New {{antibiotics}} {{are required}} to treat bacterial infections and counteract the emergence of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance.</b> Pathogen-specific <b>antibiotics</b> <b>have</b> several advantages over broad-spectrum drugs, which include minimal perturbation to the commensal microbiota. We present a strategy for targeting antibiotics to bacterial pathogens that utilises the salmochelin-mediated iron uptake machinery of Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Salmochelins are C-glucosylated derivatives of the siderophore enterobactin. The biosynthesis and utilisation of salmochelins are important for virulence because these siderophores allow pathogens to acquire iron and evade the enterobactin-scavenging host-defense protein lipocalin- 2. Inspired by the salmochelins, we report the design and chemoenzymatic preparation of glucosylated enterobactin–β-lactam conjugates that harbour the antibiotics ampicillin (Amp) and amoxicillin (Amx), hereafter GlcEnt–Amp/Amx. The GlcEnt scaffolds are based on mono- and diglucosylated Ent where one catechol moiety is functionalized at the C 5 position for antibiotic attachment. We demonstrate that GlcEnt–Amp/Amx provide up to 1000 -fold enhanced antimicrobial activity against uropathogenic E. coli relative to the parent β-lactams. Moreover, GlcEnt–Amp/Amx based on a diglucosylated Ent (DGE) platform selectively kill uropathogenic E. coli that express the salmochelin receptor IroN {{in the presence of}} non-pathogenic E. coli and other bacterial strains that include the commensal microbe Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. Moreover, GlcEnt–Amp/Amx evade the host-defense protein lipocalin- 2, and exhibit low toxicity to mammalian cells. Our work establishes that siderophore–antibiotic conjugates provide a strategy for targeting virulence, narrowing the activity spectrum of antibiotics in clinical use, and achieving selective delivery of antibacterial cargos to pathogenic bacteria on the basis of siderophore receptor expression.

40|$|The {{bacterial}} ribosome and {{its associated}} translation factors are frequent targets of <b>antibiotics,</b> and <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> muta-tions <b>have</b> been found {{in a number of}} these components. Suchmutations can potentially interact with one another in unpredict-able ways, including the phenotypic suppression of one mutation by another. These phenotypic interactions can provide evi-dence of long-range functional interactions throughout the ribosome and its functional complexes and potentially give insights into <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> mechanisms. In this study, we used genetics and experimental evolution of the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus to examine the ability of mutations in various components of the protein synthesis apparatus to suppress the streptomycin resistance phenotypes of mutations in ribosomal protein S 12, specifically those located distant from the strep-tomycin binding site. With genetic selections and strain constructions, we identified suppressor mutations in EF-Tu or in ribo-somal protein L 11. Using experimental evolution, we identified amino acid substitutions in EF-Tu or in ribosomal proteins S 4, S 5, L 14, or L 19, some of which were found to also relieve streptomycin resistance. The wide dispersal of these mutations is con-sistent with long-range functional interactions among components of the translational machinery and indicates that streptomy-cin resistance can result from the modulation of long-range conformational signals.

40|$|Antibiotics are {{chemotherapeutic}} agents, {{which have}} been a very powerful tool in the clinical management of bacterial diseases since the 1940 s. However, benefits offered by these magic bullets have been substantially lost in subsequent days following the widespread emergence and dissemination of antibiotic resistant strains. While it is obvious that excessive and imprudent use of antibiotics significantly contributes to the emergence of resistant strains, antibiotic-resistance is also observed in natural bacteria of remote places unlikely to be impacted by human intervention. Both antibiotic biosynthetic genes and resistance-conferring genes have been known to evolve billions of years ago, long before clinical use of antibiotics. Hence it appears that <b>antibiotics</b> and <b>antibiotics</b> <b>resistance</b> determinants <b>have</b> some other roles in nature, which often elude our attention because of overemphasis on the therapeutic importance of antibiotics and the crisis imposed by the antibiotic-resistance in pathogens. In the natural milieu, antibiotics are often found to be present in subinhibitory concentrations acting as signalling molecules supporting quorum sensing and biofilm formation. They also {{play an important role in}} the production of virulence factors and influence host-parasite interactions (e. g., phagocytosis, adherence to the target cell and so on). The evolutionary and ecological aspects of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistance in the naturally occurring microbial community are little understood. Therefore, the actual role of antibiotics in nature warrants in-depth investigations. Studies on such an intriguing behaviour of the microorganisms promise insight into the intricacies of the microbial physiology and are likely to provide some lead in controlling the emergence and subsequent dissemination of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance.</b> This article highlights some of the recent findings on the role of antibiotics and genes that confer <b>resistance</b> to <b>antibiotics</b> in nature...|$|R
40|$|<b>Antibiotics</b> and <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> determinants, natural {{molecules}} {{closely related}} to bacterial physiology and consistent with an ancient origin, are not only present in antibiotic-producing bacteria. Throughput sequencing technologies have revealed an unexpected reservoir of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> in the environment. These data suggest that co-evolution between <b>antibiotic</b> and <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> genes <b>has</b> occurred {{since the beginning of}} time. This evolutionary race has probably been slow because of highly regulated processes and low antibiotic concentrations. Therefore to understand this global problem, a new variable must be introduced, that the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> is a natural event, inherent to life. However, the industrial production of natural and synthetic <b>antibiotics</b> <b>has</b> dramatically accelerated this race, selecting some of the many resistance genes present in nature and contributing to their diversification. One of the best models available to understand the biological impact of selection and diversification are β-lactamases. They constitute the most widespread mechanism of resistance, at least among pathogenic bacteria, with more than 1000 enzymes identified in the literature. In the last years, there has been growing concern about the description, spread, and diversification of β-lactamases with carbapenemase activity and AmpC-type in plasmids. Phylogenies of these enzymes help the understanding of the evolutionary forces driving their selection. Moreover, understanding the adaptive potential of β-lactamases contribute to exploration the evolutionary antagonists trajectories through the design of more efficient synthetic molecules. In this review, we attempt to analyze the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>resistance</b> problem from intrinsic and environmental resistomes to the adaptive potential of resistance genes and the driving forces involved in their diversification, in order to provide a global perspective of the resistance problem.
