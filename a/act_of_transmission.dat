40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} poetics and semiotics of the Bavli (Babylonian Talmud) [...] how the Bavli, through a complex network of linguistic signs, acts on its implied reader's {{attempt to find}} meaning in the text. In doing so, I advance {{a new understanding of}} how the Bavli was composed, namely as a book written by its own readers in the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission.</b> In {{the latter half of the}} twentieth century, Bavli scholarship focused on the role of the Stam (the collective term for those people responsible for the anonymous voice of the Bavli) in the construction of individual Bavli passages (sugyot). Stam theory details how sugyot were crafted out of pre-existing sources and how the Stam works to control those sources in the service of a particular worldview. This dissertation locates a different force at work in the construction of the Bavli as a single unified book, an authorship that is above and against the work of the Stam [...] a Superstam. 	By examining the effect of the Bavli's use of rare and ambiguous terminology, I expand the unit of inquiry from the individual Bavli passage (sugya) to the Bavli in its entirety. I argue that, for the Bavli's implied reader, meaning is not found in the work of the Stam. While the Stam conveys meaning for a local reader, the global reader I explore does not artificially divide the Bavli into its constituent parts. For this reader, the Superstam acts to subvert the controlling work of the Stam through the placement of key words throughout the book. These words, when rare or ambiguous, direct the reader to other sugyot in which they appear. These sugyot, when read simultaneously, work to convey, for the reader, an expression of ambivalence on the part of the Superstam toward those moments of Stammaitic certainty. I conclude that Super-stammaitic activity itself is the result and product of readers who are trained how to read by the Bavli's own expectations. In this way, the Bavli is a text authored by its own readers who, in transmitting the text, become writers again and again. &# 8195...|$|E

40|$|My {{focus is}} on {{assessment}} criteria of language proficiency in community college education. To demand clear writing is an application of scientism; it seeks to keep separate the fact/value distinction of positivism. This dangerously undermines the democratizing possibilities of education, since clear writing, taken to its extreme, is ultimately anonymous and dehumanizing. The active student-as-citizen is, therefore, subsumed under the neoliberal dictate of the passive student-as-consumer. The process of language acquisition is reduced to a fictitious <b>act</b> <b>of</b> knowledge <b>transmission</b> and regurgitation, and, therefore, those subversive aspects of language learning, such as creativity and critical inquiry, are undermined.

40|$|Background: Considerable {{efforts are}} made to prevent {{nosocomial}} <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> Staphylococcus aureus. Healthcare-workers (HCWs) have been implicated in outbreaks but lack of evidence from non-outbreak situations means that routine HCW screening and S. aureus eradication are controversial. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study to determine how often S. aureus is transmitted from HCWs or the environment to patients on an intensive care/high dependency unit (ICU/HDU) where standard infection control measures were in place. Over fourteen months we systematically sampled HCWs, the environment and patients. Whole-genome sequencing data were used to define subtypes (≤ 40 single nucleotide variants (SNVs)) and infer recent transmission. Findings: 198 HCWs, 39 environmental locations and 1854 patients were sampled and 1819 isolates sequenced. S. aureus was detected in 29 · 5 - 39 · 7 % HCWs at single four-weekly time-points and in 58 · 1 % at least once. Monthly environmental sampling identified S. aureus in 7 · 7 - 50 · 0 % of samples. During the study, 605 genetically distinct subtypes were identified (median SNV difference 273 (IQR 162 - 399)) {{at a rate of}} 38 (range 34 - 42) per month. Only 25 instances <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> to patients were detected; seven from HCWs, two from the environment, 16 from other patients. Interpretation: In the presence of standard infection control measures HCWs infrequently <b>act</b> as sources <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> to patients. S. aureus epidemiology in ICU/HDU is characterised by continuous ingress of distinct subtypes rather than <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> genetically-related strains...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Artemisinin {{combination}} therapies (ACT), {{which are}} increasingly being introduced for treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, are more effective against sexual stage parasites (gametocytes) than previous first-line antimalarials and therefore {{have the potential to}} reduce parasite <b>transmission.</b> The size <b>of</b> this effect is estimated in symptomatic P. falciparum infections. METHODS: Data on 3, 174 patients were pooled from six antimalarial trials conducted in The Gambia and Kenya. Multivariable regression was used to investigate the role <b>of</b> <b>ACT</b> versus non-artemisinin antimalarial treatment, treatment failure, presence of pre-treatment gametocytes and submicroscopic gametocytaemia on transmission to mosquitoes and the area under the curve (AUC) of gametocyte density during the 28 days of follow up. RESULTS: ACT treatment was associated with a significant reduction in the probability of being gametocytaemic on the day <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> experiments (OR 0. 20 95 % CI 0. 16 - 0. 26), transmission to mosquitoes by slide-positive gametocyte carriers (OR mosquito infection 0. 49 95 % CI 0. 33 - 0. 73) and AUC of gametocyte density (ratio of means 0. 35 95 % CI 0. 31 - 0. 41). Parasitological treatment failure did not account for the difference between ACT and non-artemisinin impact. The presence of slide-positive gametocytaemia prior to treatment significantly reduced ACT impact on gametocytaemia (p < 0. 001). Taking account of submicroscopic gametocytaemia reduced estimates <b>of</b> <b>ACT</b> impact in a high transmission setting in Kenya, but not in a lower transmission setting in the Gambia.
