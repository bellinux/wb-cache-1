40|$|In many languages, the {{construction}} of a complex sentence can be achieved through different structural means: in particular coordinating, subordinating words, discourse markers. It may be reasonably assumed that each type of markers defines different relations between two sequences, on the semantic and pragmatic level, even though the criterion and tests used do not always clearly make out those three types and appear to differ according to the authors ([1]; [2]) In this paper, the question {{of the nature of the}} relations between two parts of a complex sentence is approached in reference to Russian data. In a series of cases, the relation between sequences p and q lies on the use of two markers coming under two different types. For example, the subordinating word raz ([3]) means that a clause p defines the scope of validation of a clause q, at first introduced as problematical. This relation between p and q can go trough a new qualification, resorting to:- a discourse marker such as tak, zna?it, stalo byt’([4]) aiming at q: (1) Nu, <b>a</b> <b>raz</b> emu ne nravitsja, stalo byt’p’eska ne pojdet (Bulgakov) (2) Raz doždja net, zna?it možno idti dal’še Removing stalo byt’in (1) and zna?it in (2) leads to an ill-formed sentence.

40|$|Objectives: Implant {{materials}} {{are used for}} a variety of reconstructive surgeries in urology including cystocoele, rectocoele, uterine prolapse, enterocoele and vault prolapse. We review the use of natural and synthetic implant materials in reconstructive urology and examine how these new biomaterials may behave in the management of those patients with surgical complications. We describe our experience with a new collagen biomaterial (Pelvicol™ Implant) in reconstructive urology and present a new technique for the surgical repair of cystocoele using a modified Raz surgical procedure for cystocoele grade III repair. Methods: Patients underwent either <b>a</b> <b>Raz</b> classical repair using polyglactin mesh (n= 30) or a modified Raz technique using Pelvicol™ Implant as a plug of overlay material (n= 28). Results: Preliminary results are presented with a mean follow-up of 9. 3 months. There were no recurrences in the Pelvicol™ Implant group compared with three recurrences in the control group. Furthermore, there were no erosions or infections in the Pelvicol™ Implant group. The modified Raz technique prolonged the operation time by only 10 minutes. Conclusions: In vaginal reconstruction surgery, the ultimate goal is not only to mend damaged tissue, but also to replace or regenerate the tissue by sustaining it on some form of matrix. The second generation of biomaterials currently being evaluated provide great potential to achieve this objective. status: publishe...|$|E

Este trabajo plantea un modelo animal basado en el uso de Ciclofosfamida (CF). Para este fin se utilizaron 41 ratas Sprague Dawley de 3 semanas de edad divididas en 4 grupos: Control(CC; n= 3 D 12), Control Ciclofosfamida (CCF n= 3 D 9), Control T. cruzi (TC; n= 3 D 6) y Experimental Ciclofosfamida - T. cruzi (CFTC n= 3 D 14).

The causes of CCM are not well known and currently there are not specific treatment for this disease, nor animal models to sustain research dealing with the pathogenesis. The present paper propose an animal model based {{in the use of}} Ciclophosphamide (CP). To achieve these goal, 41 Sprague Dawley of 3 weeks old were divided in 4 groups: Control (CC; n= 3 D 12), Control Ciclophosphamide (CCP n= 3 D 9), Control T. cruzi (TC; n= 3 D 6) and Experimental Ciclophosphamide - T. cruzi (CPTC; n= 3 D 14). The groups TC and CPTC were inoculated with 1000 parasite/gr of YBM strain trypomastigotes. CP y CPTC were treated with CP 20 mg/kg, 2 times a week per 5 times. Blood parasites counting was done using an hemocitometer, from the first to eighth week. Cardiac function and the integrity of the autonomic nervous system were evaluated by means of electrocardiografic studies done under pentobarbital anesthesia and under phenylephrine (1 mg/kg) effect. Results shown that CPTC group displayed {{an increase in the number}} of blood parasite, increase in cardiac abnormalities as extrasystole, low voltage of the QRS wave, variable RR interval, absence of S wave, and prolonged PR and QT interval.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the bispyribac-sodium mechanisms of resistance in accessions of I. rugosum and its pattern of cross-resistance with others ALS-inhibiting herbicides. Three experiments were established: (1) Bioassays on synergism between bispyribac-sodium and malathion, (2) ALS activity and (3) Cross-resistance patterns bioassays. The first experiment corresponded to dose response bioassays, using the resistant (R) accessions: IR 90 G, IR 269 P and IR 301 CO, exposed to increasing doses of bispyribac-sodium alone and 1000 g 7 ha- 1 a. i. of malathion applied 24 hours before (0; 5; 10; 20; 40; 80; 160 and 320 g 7 ha- 1 a. i.) and the susceptible (S) accession IR 143 G (0; 0. 312; 0. 625; 1. 25; 2. 5; 5; 10 and 20 g 7 ha- 1 a. i.). In the second experiment, plant tissue extracts from both R and S accessions were incubated with concentrations of 0, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 nM of bispyribac sodium, and in the third one were applied the recommended dosages indicated in the labels of the following herbicides; bispyribac-sodium (PTB), imazethapyr + imazapyr (IMI); nicosulfuron (SU) and penoxsulam (TP) at 40; 154; 30 and 60 g 7 ha- 1 a. i., respectively. The results showed that the IR 269 P accession has two bispyribac sodium resistance mechanisms; by the alteration of the herbicide active site and a mechanism outside the site of action, a metabolic degradation mediated by the enzyme P 450. It was determined that the bispyribac-sodium resistance displayed by the accessions IR 90 G and IR 301 CO is due to the alteration of the site of action of ALS.

40|$|A noninvasive, {{sensitive}} {{method of}} diagnosing certain pathological {{conditions of the}} human heart involves computational processing of digitized electrocardiographic (ECG) signals acquired from a patient at all 12 conventional ECG electrode positions. In the processing, attention is focused on low-amplitude, high-frequency components of those portions of the ECG signals known in the art as QRS complexes. The unique contribution of this method lies in the utilization of signal features and combinations of signal features from various combinations of electrode positions, not reported previously, that {{have been found to be}} helpful in diagnosing coronary artery disease and such related pathological conditions as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure. The electronic hardware and software used to acquire the QRS complexes and perform some preliminary analyses of their high-frequency components were summarized in Real-Time, High-Frequency QRS Electrocardiograph (MSC- 23154), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 27, No. 7 (July 2003), pp. 26 - 28. To recapitulate, signals from standard electrocardiograph electrodes are preamplified, then digitized at a sampling rate of 1, 000 Hz, then analyzed by the software that detects R waves and QRS complexes and analyzes them from several perspectives. The software includes provisions for averaging signals over multiple beats and for special-purpose nonrecursive digital filters with specific low- and high-frequency cutoffs. These filters, applied to the averaged signal, effect a band-pass operation in the frequency range from 150 to 250 Hz. The output of the bandpass filter is the desired high-frequency QRS signal. Further processing is then performed in real time to obtain the beat-to-beat root mean square (RMS) voltage amplitude of the filtered signal, certain variations of the RMS voltage, and such standard measures as the heart rate and R-R interval at any given time. A key signal feature analyzed in the present method is the presence versus the absence of reduced-amplitude zones (RAZs). In terms that must be simplified for the sake of brevity, <b>an</b> <b>RAZ</b> comprises several cycles of a high-frequency QRS signal during which the amplitude of the high-frequency oscillation in a portion of the signal is abnormally low (see figure). A given signal sample exhibiting an interval of reduced amplitude may or may not be classified as <b>an</b> <b>RAZ,</b> depending on quantitative criteria regarding peaks and troughs within the reduced-amplitude portion of the high-frequency QRS signal. This analysis is performed in all 12 leads in real time...|$|R
