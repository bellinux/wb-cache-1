500|$|Formby was <b>always</b> <b>worried</b> {{that his}} son George would watch him on stage, as he did not wish the boy to become a comic, saying [...] "one fool in the family is enough". Nevertheless, {{although}} he had sent George away to train as a jockey, in 1915 he allowed his son to appear on screen, taking the lead part of a stable boy in By the Shortest of Heads, a thriller directed by Bert Haldane. After the filming, Formby sent his son to Ireland, to continue his jockey training, and also sent the five horses Formby had purchased that year, which joined others he had previously bought.|$|E
500|$|... "Welcome to the Family" [...] {{features}} {{a recording of}} Andrew Wade's heart beat {{towards the end of}} the track. The title track, [...] "Homesick", was written as one piece, before being split into two songs, which the band thought didn't work well and changed it back to one song. McKinnon said he was [...] "proud" [...] of the track: [...] "My parents were really happy when they first heard it: My dad is <b>always</b> <b>worried</b> about me and my mom really did ask me to write her some soft songs. I finally did." [...] "Holdin' It Down for the Underground" [...] came about after McKinnon lost two family members and writing the song helped him relieve the pain.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by film-maker Brett Ratner in Los Angeles, and features a cameo appearance from 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer. Prior to filming the video, or releasing the single, Carey had toned her body, and lost a reported twenty pounds. Due to her slim-down, she and Ratner wanted to flaunt Carey's new figure {{as much as possible}} throughout the video: [...] "Mariah looks better than she has ever looked. It's ridiculous. Mariah has an incredible body, but she was always kind of very voluptuous. Now she's just like, fit. And we were like, we've got to show this body." [...] As the pair came up with the video's plot, Ratner contacted McBrayer to play a male leading role, alongside Carey. After receiving the call, McBrayer claimed he was so shocked by the proposal, that he didn't believe it at first. He only met with the producers after Ratner personally called him and assured him the authenticity of the offer. In an interview with MTV News, McBrayer joked [...] "I'm <b>always</b> <b>worried</b> now that somebody is pranking me, so at first I was very leery. But when I heard it was legit, and then later on we {{got a phone call from}} Brett Ratner, who directed it. I was like, 'This is either a very elaborate prank, or this is the real deal.'" [...] In the fantasy-themed story, he recalled what he considered the video's most memorable scene, in which he and Carey, dressed in medieval attire, were walking with a unicorn. Additionally, he described the filming process as very simple, as they were given very loose directions and pointers. McBrayer claimed that during one take, they were meant to play Frisbee on the mansion lawn, and he accidentally threw it at Carey's face, jokingly adding [...] "by the time she spins back around — bonk, right in her face. I threw a Frisbee in Mariah Carey's face! I'm like, I'm fired!." [...] When questioned by critics regarding the song and video, Carey responded [...] "Have you seen the 'Touch My Body' video? C'mon. Clearly you must see the humour in that. Even the lyrics, 'I will hunt you down'. If anyone doesn't get the joke by this time then they are an idiot." [...] In an interview with Reuters, Carey described working with Ratner, and her experience filming the video: ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{suspected}} {{abuses of}} the USA PATRIOT Act were brought to light in June 2013 with articles about collection of American call records by the NSA and the PRISM program (see 2013 mass surveillance disclosures), Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, who introduced the Patriot Act in 2001, said that the National Security Agency overstepped its bounds. He released a statement saying “While I believe the Patriot Act appropriately balanced national security concerns and civil rights, I have <b>always</b> <b>worried</b> about potential abuses.” He added: “Seizing phone records of millions of innocent people is excessive and un-American.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Along {{with many}} other slaves, Vesey had belonged to the Second Presbyterian church, and chafed against its {{restrictions}} on black members. In 1818 he was among founders of a congregation on what {{was known as the}} [...] "Bethel circuit" [...] of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME Church). This had been organized in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1816 as the first independent black denomination in the United States. The AME Church in Charleston was supported by leading white clergy. In 1818 white authorities briefly ordered the church closed, for violating slave code rules that prohibited black congregations from holding worship services after sunset. The church attracted 1848 members, making it the second largest AME church in the nation. City officials <b>always</b> <b>worried</b> about slaves in groups; they closed the church again for a time in 1821, as the City Council warned that its classes were becoming a [...] "school for slaves" [...] (under the slave code, slaves were prohibited from being taught to read). Vesey was reported as a leader in the congregation, drawing from the Bible to project hope for freedom.|$|E

60|$|Joan went to {{the seat}} by the tree, near the camp-fire. A purple {{twilight}} was shadowing the canon. Far above, on the bold peak the last warmth of the afterglow was fading. There was no wind, no sound, no movement. Joan wondered where Jim Cleve was then. They had often sat in the twilight. She felt an unreasonable resentment toward him, knowing she was to blame, but blaming him for her plight. Then suddenly {{she thought of her}} uncle, of home, of her kindly old aunt who <b>always</b> <b>worried</b> so about her. Indeed, there was cause to worry. She felt sorrier for them than for herself. And that broke her spirit momentarily. Forlorn, and with a wave of sudden sorrow and dread and hopelessness, she dropped her head upon her knees and covered her face. Tears were a relief. She forgot Kells and the part she must play. But she remembered swiftly--at the rude touch of his hand.|$|E

60|$|Now the cowherd didn't {{like walking}} in the evening, because, he said, he had been out grazing the cattle all day, and was glad to sit down when night came; but the {{goldsmith}} <b>always</b> <b>worried</b> him so that the poor man had to go against his will. This at last so annoyed him {{that he tried to}} think how he could pick a quarrel with the goldsmith, so that he should not beg him to walk with him any more. He asked another cowherd for advice, and he said the best thing he could do was to go across and kill the goldsmith's wife, for then the goldsmith would be sure to regard him as an enemy; so, being a foolish person, and there being no laws in that country by which a man would be certainly punished for such a crime, the cowherd one evening took a big stick and went across to the goldsmith's house when only Mrs. Goldsmith was at home, and banged her on the head so hard that she died then and there.|$|E
