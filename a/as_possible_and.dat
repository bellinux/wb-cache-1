5|$|An {{important}} {{lesson from the}} Tunisia Campaign was that neuropsychiatric casualties had {{to be treated as}} soon <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>and</b> not evacuated from the combat zone. This was not done {{in the early stages of}} the Sicilian Campaign, and large numbers of neuropsychiatric casualties were evacuated to North Africa, with the result that treatment became complicated and only 15 percent of them were returned to duty. As the campaign wore on, the system became better organized and nearly 50 percent were restored to combat duty.|$|E
5|$|Croatia has {{implemented}} a mine-awareness educational programme {{aimed at reducing}} the frequency of mine-related accidents through an ongoing information campaign. The programme is conducted by the Croatian Red Cross, the Ministry of Science, Education and Sports {{and a number of}} NGOs in cooperation with the Croatian Mine Action Centre. The Croatian Mine Action Centre actively supports NGOs to develop as many programmes <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>and</b> attract new NGOs to mine-awareness and educational activities. It maintains an accessible online database with cartographic information on the location of mine-suspected areas in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Frogs such as Physalaemus nattereri, Physalaemus deimaticus, and Pleurodema brachyops have {{a warning}} display behaviour. These animals inflate {{themselves}} with air {{and raise their}} hind parts to appear as large <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> <b>and</b> display brightly coloured markings and eyespots to intimidate predators. Seven species of frogs in the genus Pleurodema have lumbar glands (making the animals distasteful, so in their case the display is likely aposematic); these glands are usually boldly contrasted in black as a further warning.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to a massive disparity between the East and West Divisions, it decided {{in the middle of}} the season to grant the fourth place Western team a playoff berth.

5|$|Once war was declared, Voorhis {{supported}} the internment of Japanese-Americans, though {{he suggested that}} the evacuations be done in as voluntary a manner <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>and</b> that officials be appointed to administer their property to avoid forced sales at bargain prices. During the war, Voorhis advocated more efficiently taxing higher incomes and war profits, planning against postwar unemployment, and planning for the nutritional needs of Americans. Voorhis also opposed dominance of big business in the war effort. Congress, for the most part, ignored Voorhis's pleas.|$|E
5|$|The British First Army {{commander}} General Henry Horne {{ordered the}} Canadian Corps to relieve I Corps from their position opposite {{the city of}} Lens on 10 July 1917 and directed Canadian Corps commander Arthur Currie {{to develop a plan}} for capturing the town by the end of July 1917.

5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat as much <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>and</b> store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E

5|$|According to Larousse Gastronomique, the durian {{fruit is}} ready to eat when its husk begins to crack. However, the ideal stage of {{ripeness}} to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of D. zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in northern Thailand, the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers prefer the fruit to be as ripe and pungent in aroma <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>and</b> may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic, the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} {{they are}} short of money, {{a group of}} four robbers decide to execute a bank heist. The four create a plan and hire an unwitting chauffeur to drive them to their location. As soon as they reach an isolated road, the robbers force the chauffeur out of the car, gag him, and throw him into a ditch. The robbers then drive {{the car to the}} bank. After entering, they kill a security guard and use explosives to force the bank vault open. The thieves steal as much money <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> <b>and</b> make a quick retreat to their car. Back in the park, a young couple on a walk discover the unconscious body of the chauffeur, and the man calls the police.|$|E
