25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E
500|$|In an 18 August 2006 Science Friday interview, Mike Brown {{expressed}} {{doubt that}} a scientific definition was even necessary. He stated, [...] "The analogy that I <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> use {{is the word}} [...] "continent". You know, the word [...] "continent" [...] has no scientific definition ... they're just cultural definitions, and I think the geologists are wise to leave that one alone and not try to redefine things so that the word [...] "continent" [...] has a big, strict definition." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} verse, Ross' lyrics are {{somewhat}} different, [...] "Red bottom Bawse house big as Baltimore" [...] and [...] "With a blonde bombshell trying {{to bond with}} your boy." [...] Additionally, he makes reference to strippers, as well as driving with a suspended drivers' license. Throughout the bridge, Carey sings about achieving despite surrounding odds: [...] "In spite of the chains that bind you/ You can see the mountain top/ It’s not too far." [...] Additionally, towards the last chorus, the singer releases a series of her [...] "signature" [...] high notes. During an August 2, conference call, Carey described how she felt working with the duo, and how she felt Ross' voice blended well with her own: [...] "Working with Ross and Meek on the same record was incredible. Obviously Ross is a star and everybody loves him. I'm a fan of his music," [...] said Carey on the collaboration. [...] "I really, really {{wanted to work with}} him. I love the tone of his voice. I think the contrast of his voice and mine would be something special. I <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> do collaborations that people might think are different." ...|$|E

500|$|Jude Law {{stars as}} Joseph [...] "Joe" [...] Sullivan, a.k.a. Sky Captain: He {{commands}} a private air force {{known as the}} Flying Legion. His personal aircraft is a modified Curtiss P-40. In 2002, producer Jon Avnet showed Law the teaser trailer and the actor was very impressed by what he saw. He remembers, [...] "All I got at that early stage was that he'd used pretty advanced and unused technology to create a very retrospective look." [...] Avnet gave him the script to read and some preliminary artwork to look at. Law: [...] "What was clear was also that at the center was a really great cinematic relationship, which you could put into any genre and it would work. You know, the kind of bickering [...] I <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> call it The African Queen meets Buck Rogers." [...] Avnet {{wanted to work with}} Law because he knew that the actor had [...] "worked both period, who worked both having theatrical experience, who worked on blue screen, who hadn't hit yet as a major action star." [...] The actor had just finished filming Cold Mountain (2003) and was intrigued at going from filming on real locations to working on a movie done completely on a soundstage. [...] Sky Captain would be one of three Jude Law films released by Paramount Pictures in 2004, along with the remake of Alfie (2004) and [...] Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004). It also was one of six overall Jude Law films released that year.|$|E
500|$|A {{focus of}} Tang's {{art is the}} theme of {{national}} and cultural identities, I Was Born Japanese (1995) being an example. Tang notes that he has had four nationalities. He was issued with a Japanese birth certificate as he was born during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. He became a British national after World War II, a Malaysian citizen when Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, and a Singaporean citizen when Singapore gained full independence in 1965. While living in the UK he was conscious of his Chinese identity, but later on he took the view that he might not be fully Chinese since China had been occupied by the Mongols and Manchurians: [...] "I'm not sure if I'm 100% Chinese blood. I'm sure my ancestor has got mixture of Mongolian and even Thai and Miao people [...] We are all mixed, and this is true. But I <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> think {{that there is only one}} race in the world. We are all one human race." [...] Another of Tang's performances, Jantung Pisang – Heart of a Tree, Heart of a People, centres around the banana tree. He was inspired by the fact that the banana is used widely in Southeast Asia as an offering to bring blessings, but is also feared as it is associated with ghosts and spirits. He also sees banana trees as a reminder of the lack of democracy in certain parts of the world: [...] "Democracy in many Asian countries and Third World countries is as shallow as the roots of a banana tree. We need to deepen [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|During an interview, Tempah {{commented on}} his second album: [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> work with {{different}} people on each project I do, just {{so you get a}} different sound and angle. I will be working with some of the same people I did for the first album, {{you know what they say}} ‘if it ain't broke then don’t try and fix it’." [...] Tempah hoped to collaborate with other artists: [...] "I really want to collaborate with Toronto's very own Drake. I think he's amazing at what he does. I'd also like to collaborate with Adele, Sleigh Bells, Lykke Li, The Script, Dev, James Blake ― those are the few that I'd really like to work with." [...] Tempah asked a number of artists to appear on the album, including Gary Barlow, Chris Martin, Dizzee Rascal, and The Script. At the 2012 BRIT Awards, Tempah announced his second album would be called Demonstration. On 24 June 2012, Tempah performed on the main stage at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, performing two of his newest songs: [...] "Mosh Pit" [...] and [...] "Drinking from the Bottle", the latter of which he features on with Calvin Harris as the lead artist, and features on Harris' 2012 album 18 Months. In interviews, other artists announced that they were working on his album such as Labrinth, Dizzee Rascal, Big Sean and Emeli Sandé. Previous collaborators Naughty Boy and Labrinth have produced multiple tracks for the album, following their appearances on Disc-Overy. Chase & Status were on additional production duties for [...] "Mosh Pit". They had previously worked with Tinie on their album No More Idols for the single [...] "Hitz". Tempah's vocals from the song are also sampled on the hidden track [...] "5 Minutes".|$|E

500|$|Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian {{said that}} before Guetta's collaborations with Kelis ("Acapella") and Rowland, she felt [...] " [...] was ruining R by turning all of my {{favorite}} ladies into Euro cheesemongers". However [...] "Acapella" [...] changed Nicholson's mind and she said, [...] "'Commander' is further evidence of this". Whilst Fraser McAlpine awarded the song four stars, his review was neither positive nor negative. He said [...] "Singers <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> sing about how brilliantly attractive and astonishing (and bossy) they are. Even if the words have a double meaning, which hints that they are merely mouthing the self-regard of a rampant egomaniac, who is laughing and rubbing his hands every time they start to sing, they don't mind. Why would they? The song mentions hair, and being {{better than the other}} ladies. That's what singers live for. [...] one extra star for the stoopid grammar switcheroo ... because of the chorus, which rules." [...] Gavin Martin of The Mirror made similar comments neither praising nor criticizing the song, instead saying it will put her [...] "firmly in control of the dance floor". Entertainment Weekly named it [...] "the number one summer jam of the year" [...] whilst music station KISS 100 called it fabulous and made it their song of the week for the week beginning May 24, 2010. A reviewer from the network said, [...] "Commander is another smash ... Kelly's taking command! With glamour set to max and drama cranked up to full power 'Commander' is proof that Kelly means business!" [...] In Fitness magazine's 100best workout songs, [...] "Commander" [...] was named one of the ten best dance workout songs for its bouncy 125beats per minute composition.|$|E

I just decided to make her lighter, prettier [...] I kept the humor; I <b>always</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> play a little bit of humor. And I was playing her straight [...] at first !
