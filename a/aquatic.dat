5|$|A {{large number}} of insects live either part or the whole of their lives underwater. In {{many of the more}} {{primitive}} orders of insect, the immature stages are spent in an <b>aquatic</b> environment. Some groups of insects, like certain water beetles, have <b>aquatic</b> adults as well.|$|E
5|$|A {{study on}} the fully <b>aquatic</b> Archegosaurus shows that it's heat balance, gas exchange, osmoregulation, and {{digestion}} were more {{similar to those of}} fish than those of modern <b>aquatic</b> amphibians like salamanders.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{earliest}} temnospondyls were primarily semiaquatic, {{they had the}} ability to feed on land. Later, eryopoids and dissorophoids, some well adapted to terrestrial life, also fed on land. Some eryopoids became better adapted toward life in water, and shifted their diets toward <b>aquatic</b> organisms. The first primarily <b>aquatic</b> feeders were archegosaurs in the Permian. Trematosaurs and capitosaurs became independently <b>aquatic</b> and also returned to this type of feeding.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 100 {{dead fish}} were {{reported}} in two streams after fire retardant was accidentally dropped on them. Aside from a temporary decrease in a few species of <b>aquatic</b> insects, no long-term impact has been observed on <b>aquatic</b> life in any of Yellowstone's rivers or lakes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aquatic</b> {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} recognized {{as an integral part}} of the river otter's diet. Otters consume more <b>aquatic</b> insects in the summer as the populations increase and specific life stages heighten their susceptibility. Most <b>aquatic</b> invertebrates preyed upon by the otters are from the families Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), Plecoptera (stonefly nymphs), and Coleoptera (adult beetles). Invertebrates discovered within scats or digestive tracts could most likely be a secondary food item, first being consumed by the fish that are subsequently preyed upon by the otters.|$|E

5|$|Cormorants are {{medium to}} large <b>aquatic</b> birds with mainly dark plumage {{and areas of}} {{coloured}} skin on the face. The bill is long, thin and sharply hooked for catching fish and <b>aquatic</b> invertebrates. They nest in colonies, usually by the sea. There are about 39 species worldwide, with two recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Divers are <b>aquatic</b> birds {{the size}} of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. They swim well and fly {{adequately}} but, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body, are clumsy on land. They feed on fish and other <b>aquatic</b> animals.|$|E

5|$|Most {{amphibians}} today remain semiaquatic, {{living the}} first stage of their lives as fish-like tadpoles. Several groups of tetrapods, such as the snakes and cetaceans, have lost some or all of their limbs. In addition, many tetrapods have returned to partially <b>aquatic</b> or fully <b>aquatic</b> lives throughout the history of the group (modern examples of fully <b>aquatic</b> tetrapods include cetaceans and sirenians). The first returns to an <b>aquatic</b> lifestyle may have occurred as early as the Carboniferous Period whereas other returns occurred as recently as the Cenozoic, as in cetaceans, pinnipeds, and several modern amphibians.|$|E

5|$|Threats to otter {{populations in}} North America vary regionally. Otter inhabitation is {{affected}} by type, distribution, and density of <b>aquatic</b> habitats and characteristics of human activities. Preceding the settlement of North America by Europeans, otters were prevalent among <b>aquatic</b> habitats {{throughout most of the}} continent. Trapping, loss or degradation of <b>aquatic</b> habitats through filling of wetlands, and development of coal, oil, gas, tanning, timber, and other industries, resulted in extirpations, or declines, in otter populations in many areas. In 1980, an examination conducted on U.S. river otter populations determined they were extirpated in 11 states, and had experienced drastic lapses in 9 others. The most severe population declines occurred in interior regions where fewer <b>aquatic</b> habitats supported fewer otter populations. Although the distribution became reduced in some regions of southern Canada, the only province-wide extirpation occurred on Prince Edward Island.|$|E
