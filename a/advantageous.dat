5|$|When the allele {{frequency}} is very small, drift can also overpower selection even in large populations. For example, while disadvantageous mutations are usually eliminated quickly in large populations, new <b>advantageous</b> mutations {{are almost as}} vulnerable to loss through genetic drift as are neutral mutations. Not until the {{allele frequency}} for the <b>advantageous</b> mutation reaches a certain threshold will genetic drift have no effect.|$|E
5|$|A feature new to {{the series}} {{involves}} Crash storing a Titan {{in his pocket and}} utilizing it when it is most <b>advantageous.</b> When Crash is riding a Titan, any Mojo collected goes to the Titan. If enough is collected, the Titan's abilities are upgraded rather than Crash's.|$|E
5|$|In general, a rotary broach {{will not}} cut as {{accurately}} as a push or pull broach. However, {{the ability to}} use this type of cutting tool on common machine tools is highly <b>advantageous.</b>|$|E
5|$|The art of measuring, as {{precisely}} as possible, probabilities of things, {{with the goal}} {{that we would be}} able always to choose or follow in our judgments and actions that course, which will have been determined to be better, more satisfactory, safer or more <b>advantageous.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the LWF {{program called}} for a {{structural}} life of 4,000 flight hours, capable of achieving 7.33g with 80% internal fuel; GD's engineers decided to design the F-16's airframe life for 8,000 hours and for 9-g maneuvers on full internal fuel. This proved <b>advantageous</b> when the aircraft's mission changed from solely air-to-air combat to multi-role operations. Changes in operational use and additional systems have increased weight, necessitating multiple structural strengthening programs.|$|E
5|$|However, {{towards the}} end of his reign Manuel's {{achievements}} in the east were compromised by a serious defeat at Myriokephalon, which in large part resulted from his arrogance in attacking a well-defended Seljuk position. Although the Byzantines recovered and Manuel concluded an <b>advantageous</b> peace with Sultan Kilij Arslan II, Myriokephalon proved to be the final, unsuccessful effort by the empire to recover the interior of Anatolia from the Turks.|$|E
5|$|If Gage did not dip {{his hand}} {{unnecessarily}} {{in the public}} till, he did engage in the relatively common practices of nepotism and political favouritism. In addition to securing <b>advantageous</b> positions for several people named Gage or Kemble, he also apparently assisted in the placement {{of some of his}} friends and political supporters, or their children.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{under the}} novel {{conditions}} of attrition warfare, war pigeons in their traditional role as pigeon post saw a renaissance. Neubronner's mobile dovecote {{found its way}} to the Battle of Verdun, where it proved so <b>advantageous</b> that similar facilities were used on a larger scale in the Battle of the Somme. After the war, the War Ministry responded to Neubronner's inquiry to the effect that the use of pigeons in aerial photography had no military value and further experiments were not justified.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, the Grimaldi {{fortunes}} were restored when {{descendants of}} both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely <b>advantageous</b> to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini {{had been the}} heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu joined other National Liberals {{in expressing}} {{opposition}} to the trade convention Catargiu had signed with Austria-Hungary, which was <b>advantageous</b> to the latter's exports, and which, they claimed, was leading Romanian industry to ruin. He accepted it while in office, but looked into adopting European-like patent laws, {{as a measure of}} encouraging local industries. A National Liberal government would repeal the agreement in 1886.|$|E
5|$|STAC {{stated that}} an SST would have {{economic}} performance similar to existing subsonic types. Although they would burn more fuel in cruise, {{they would be}} able to fly more sorties in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route. This would remain economically <b>advantageous</b> as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, as it did at the time.|$|E
5|$|Stealth is a {{significant}} element of the gameplay; frequent gunfire can alert distant guards, and activated alarms can trigger infinitely-respawning enemies. Therefore, to avoid gunfights with numerous opponents, it is <b>advantageous</b> to eliminate soldiers and security cameras before they spot or hear the player. Certain weapons incorporate suppressor or telescopic sight attachments to aid the player in killing enemies discreetly. There are no health-recovery items in the game, although armour vests can be acquired to provide a secondary health bar.|$|E
5|$|The {{alternative}} {{train of}} thought {{is that it was}} simply not <b>advantageous</b> to be large until the appearance of the Ediacarans: the environment favoured the small over the large. Examples of such scenarios today include plankton, whose small size allows them to reproduce rapidly to take advantage of ephemerally abundant nutrients in algal blooms. But for large size never to be favourable, the environment would have to be very different indeed.|$|E
5|$|The fore gut of {{some species}} extends the whole {{length of the}} insect {{and can be used}} to store prey for {{digestion}} later. This may be <b>advantageous</b> in an insect that feeds intermittently. Chinese mantises live longer, grow faster, and produce more young when they are able to eat pollen.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape and}} {{dimensions}} of the proboscis have evolved to give different species a wider and therefore more <b>advantageous</b> diet. There is an allometric scaling relationship between body mass of Lepidoptera and length of proboscis from which an interesting adaptive departure is the unusually long-tongued sphinx moth Xanthopan morganii praedicta. Charles Darwin predicted the existence and proboscis length of this moth before its discovery based on {{his knowledge of the}} long-spurred Madagascan star orchid Angraecum sesquipedale.|$|E
5|$|A {{prerequisite}} for natural selection {{to result in}} adaptive evolution, novel traits and speciation {{is the presence of}} heritable genetic variation that results in fitness differences. Genetic variation is the result of mutations, genetic recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly <b>advantageous</b> or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However, many mutations in non-coding DNA have deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, a majority of mutations in humans are slightly deleterious.|$|E
5|$|Abundant {{evidence}} for the domestication of guinea pigs has been found at Tequendama and Aguazuque where the small rodents formed part of the diet of the people, who consumed mainly white-tailed deer, hunted on the plains surrounding the various lakes and rivers. The diet was greatly expanded when early agriculture was introduced, possibly influenced by migrations from the south; present-day Peru. The main cultivated product was maize in various forms and colours, while tubers formed a significant {{other part of the}} food source. The fertile soils of especially the Bogotá savanna proved <b>advantageous</b> for the development of this agriculture, still evidenced today by the widespread farmfields outside the Colombian capital.|$|E
5|$|According to Ibn Saad, {{opposition}} in Mecca started when Muhammad delivered verses that condemned idol worship and the polytheism {{practiced by the}} Meccan forefathers. However, the Quranic exegesis maintains that it began as Muhammad started public preaching. As his followers increased, Muhammad became {{a threat to the}} local tribes and rulers of the city, whose wealth rested upon the Ka'aba, the focal point of Meccan religious life that Muhammad threatened to overthrow. Muhammad's denunciation of the Meccan traditional religion was especially offensive to his own tribe, the Quraysh, as they were the guardians of the Ka'aba. Powerful merchants attempted to convince Muhammad to abandon his preaching; he was offered admission to the inner circle of merchants, as well as an <b>advantageous</b> marriage. He refused both of these offers.|$|E
5|$|As an {{alternative}} to the time-consuming task of creating a breach, an escalade could be attempted to capture the walls with fighting along the walkways behind the battlements. In this instance, attackers would be vulnerable to arrowfire. A safer option for those assaulting a castle was to use a siege tower, sometimes called a belfry. Once ditches around a castle were partially filled in, these wooden, movable towers could be pushed against the curtain wall. As well as offering some protection for those inside, a siege tower could overlook the interior of a castle, giving bowmen an <b>advantageous</b> position from which to unleash missiles.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} located in a region of the galaxy that is {{chemically}} <b>advantageous</b> {{for the development of}} life, a star must also avoid an excessive number of catastrophic cosmic events with the potential to damage life on its otherwise habitable planets. Nearby supernovae, for example, have the potential to severely harm life on a planet; with excessive frequency, such catastrophic outbursts have the potential to sterilize an entire region of a galaxy for billions of years. The galactic bulge, for example, experienced an initial wave of extremely rapid star formation, triggering a cascade of supernovae that for five billion years left that area almost completely unable to develop life.|$|E
5|$|At around 10:00am, the Israelis renewed the attack, {{moving toward}} Jebel Mariam, Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. The paratroopers at Jebel Mariam became engaged in intense {{fighting}} but, with their <b>advantageous</b> position, {{were able to}} repel the attack by late afternoon. Meanwhile, the Israelis concentrated artillery and mortar fire against the Sa'iqa positions at Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. At noon, advance Israeli elements engaged with a Sa'iqa reconnaissance unit, and the Israelis lost two tanks and a half-track. At 1:00pm, an Israeli paratrooper company attacked Abu 'Atwa without first scouting ahead, and was ambushed and annihilated. The attack ended after paratroopers suffered over fifty casualties and lost four tanks.|$|E
5|$|Bad weather {{prevented}} {{this action}} and on 24 December, Jhangar, a strategically <b>advantageous</b> {{position in the}} Naushahra Sector, was captured by the Pakistanis which gave them control over the communication lines between Mirpur and Poonch and provided a starting point from which attacks could be made on Naushahra. The following month, the Indian Army undertook several operations in the north-west of Naushahra to stop further advances by the Pakistani forces. Brigadier Mohammad Usman, the commanding officer of the 50th Para Brigade, had made necessary arrangements to counter the expected attack. Soldiers were deployed in small groups on possible enemy approaches.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{economic}} background, large-scale systems are presently distributed where the support regimes {{have been the most}} consistent, or the most <b>advantageous.</b> Total capacity of worldwide PV plants above 4 MWAC was assessed by Wiki-Solar as 36 GW in c. 2,300 installations at the end of 2014 and represents about 25 percent of total global PV capacity of 139GW. The countries which had the most capacity, in descending order, were the United States, China, Germany, India, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Canada and South Africa. Activities in the key markets are reviewed individually below.|$|E
5|$|De Grasse {{ordered his}} fleet {{to prepare for}} action, and {{on the morning of}} April29 sailed for Fort Royal with the convoy ships hugging the coast and the armed ships in battle line. Hood's fleet was seen bearing toward them around 08:00 but deGrasse held the weather gauge. At about 09:20, Hood was joined by Prince William, a 64-gun ship that had been at St. Lucia. The two fleets {{continued}} to push for <b>advantageous</b> positions. Hood's leeward position prevented deGrasse from bringing the convoy to the harbour, but the four previously blockaded French ships were able to sail out and strengthen deGrasse's position. Gibraltar, as Drake's flagship, led the British rear division.|$|E
5|$|During {{the siege}} of Amphipolis, the Chalkidian League, led by Olynthos, began to fear Philip's {{territorial}} ambitions (since Amphipolis also controlled access to Chalkidiki), and therefore sought to ally with Athens against him. However, the Athenians still hoped to receive Amphipolis from Philip and so refused. Philip himself feared an alliance of the powerful Chalkidian League and Athens, so he moved to reassure the Olynthians by offering them an alliance on very <b>advantageous</b> terms. As part of the agreement with Olynthos, Philip was to capture the city of Potidea, located in {{the territory of the}} Chalkidian League. Potidea was at that time under the control of Athens, and represented a threat to the stability of the league.|$|E
5|$|Edward's opponents {{began to}} gather around Isabella and Mortimer in Paris, and Edward became {{increasingly}} {{anxious about the}} possibility that Mortimer might invade England. Isabella and Mortimer turned to William, the Count of Hainaut, and proposed a marriage between Prince Edward and William's daughter, Philippa. In return for the <b>advantageous</b> alliance with the English heir to the throne, and a sizeable dower for the bride, William offered 132 transport vessels and 8 warships to assist in the invasion of England. Prince Edward and Philippa were betrothed on 27 August, and Isabella and Mortimer prepared for their campaign.|$|E
5|$|Established {{traits are}} not immutable; traits that have high fitness in one {{environmental}} context {{may be much}} less fit if environmental conditions change. In the absence of natural selection to preserve such a trait, it becomes more variable and deteriorate over time, possibly resulting in a vestigial manifestation of the trait, also called evolutionary baggage. In many circumstances, the apparently vestigial structure may retain a limited functionality, or may be co-opted for other <b>advantageous</b> traits in a phenomenon known as preadaptation. A famous example of a vestigial structure, {{the eye of the}} blind mole-rat, is believed to retain function in photoperiod perception.|$|E
5|$|Evolution {{also does}} not require that organisms become more complex. Although the history of life shows an {{apparent}} trend towards the evolution of biological complexity; {{there is a question}} if this appearance of increased complexity is real, or if it comes from neglecting the fact that the majority of life on Earth has always consisted of prokaryotes. In this view, complexity is not a necessary consequence of evolution, but that specific circumstances of evolution on Earth frequently made greater complexity <b>advantageous</b> and thus naturally selected for. Depending on the situation, organisms' complexity can either increase, decrease, or stay the same, and all three of these trends have been observed in evolution.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of the British and their Indian allies in western Canada, Harrison and Lewis Cass, {{governor}} of the Michigan Territory, were delegated the responsibility for negotiating a peace treaty with the Indians, known as the Treaty of Greenville (1814). In June 1815, at President Madison's request, the U.S. government appointed Harrison to serve as one of the commissioners responsible for negotiating a second postwar treaty with the Indians that became known as the Treaty of Spring Wells (1815). Both treaties were <b>advantageous</b> to the United States. In the Spring Wells treaty the tribes ceded a large tract of land in the west, providing additional land for American purchase and settlement.|$|E
5|$|General Archibald Wavell—the {{commander-in-chief}} of the British Middle East Command—conceived Operation Brevity as a rapid blow in the Sollum area. Wavell {{intended to}} create <b>advantageous</b> conditions {{from which to}} launch Operation Battleaxe, the main offensive that he was planning for June. Operation Brevity's primary objectives were to recapture the Halfaya Pass, to drive the enemy from the Sollum and Capuzzo areas, and to deplete Rommel's forces. A secondary objective was to advance toward Tobruk, although {{only as far as}} supplies would allow, and without risking the force committed to the operation.|$|E
5|$|Goronwy ap Tudur Hen was one {{of three}} sons of Welsh noble Tudur Hen (English: Tudur the Elder) and Anghared fil Ithel Fychan, {{alongside}} Madog ap Tudur Hen and Hywel ap Tudur Hen. Tudor Hen had first been in service to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (also known as Llywelyn the Last), the King of Gwynedd, but retained his titles under the conquest of Wales by King Edward I of England. But during the rebellion of Madog ap Llywelyn, Tudur acted as his steward. After the rebellion failed, Tudur pledged his loyalty to Edward. Utilising the more <b>advantageous</b> property laws of England, Tudur saw to it that his lands were passed seamlessly upon his death in 1311 into the hands of Goronwy.|$|E
5|$|He {{acted as}} an {{official}} representative for the English Royal Family in the Perfeddwlad territories. Tudur used the English property laws, which he found more <b>advantageous</b> in his position than those used by the Welsh, as they allowed for inheritance of lands by a single party. He continued to hold the lands in North Wales and Cardiganshire which he had inherited. Upon his death in 1311, his holdings passed to his son Goronwy ap Tudur Hen. He had two further sons, Madog and Hywel. Tudur Hen was interned in Bangor Priory on 11 October 1311; his son, Goronwy, was also placed there on 11 December 1331 following his death.|$|E
5|$|If White is {{compelled}} to play Nb1–d2, {{it is sometimes}} a minuscule positional concession, as it {{makes it harder for}} this knight to reach its ideal square d5. However, if Black is later {{compelled to}} exchange Bxd2, that is <b>advantageous</b> to White who thereby gains the bishop pair. Besides, in some situations the Bb4 could be as misplaced as the Nd2. Finally, if White has to play Bd2, then Black should exchange the bishops only if White is forced to recapture with the Nb1, as a recapture by the Qd1 would still allow the Nb1 to reach the d5-square through Nb1–c3–d5.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, after {{tensions}} between the NWC and HBC had erupted into violence the NWC was forced to merge into the HBC. As a result, the HBC acquired the Columbia District and its trade with China. At first the system of shipping furs via the American Perkins and Company was continued, but in 1822 the United States Customs Service imposed a heavy ad valorem duty on the proceeds. The HBC stopped using American middlemen and instead tried selling furs through the EIC. In 1824 and 1825 the HBC sold 20,000 beaver and 7,000 land-otter skins in China through the EIC, but the arrangement did not prove <b>advantageous</b> for either firm.|$|E
5|$|In Lillehammer's {{bids for}} the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, Balbergbakken was the {{proposed}} site of ski jumping. Lillehammer {{was awarded the}} 1994 Olympics in 1988, but a year later the plans to use Balbergbanen were abandoned. The venue was regarded as unsuitable; for instance NOK30 million {{would have to be}} spent on building a new access road. In addition, a new water and sewer system, new stands, participant facilities and a normal hill would have to be built. The available space at Balbergbakken was limited, and the organizers saw it as <b>advantageous</b> to have the ski stadium close to the ski jumping hills.|$|E
5|$|In clock-limited sports, games {{often end}} with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than {{competing}} aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most <b>advantageous</b> strategy is some form of aggressive strategy. In contrast, again, the clock comes into play even {{in the case of}} multi-day Test and first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss. Baseball offers no such reward for conservative batting.|$|E
