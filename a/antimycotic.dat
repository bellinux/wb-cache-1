40|$|AbstractAimsThe {{incidence}} of secondary systemic fungal infections has sharply increased in bacterial septic patients. <b>Antimycotics</b> exhibit immunomodulatory properties, yet these effects are incompletely understood in secondary systemic fungal infections following bacterial sepsis. We investigated {{a model of}} systemic inflammation to determine whether <b>antimycotics</b> (liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB), itraconazol (ITC), and anidulafungin (ANI)) modulate the gene and protein expression {{as well as the}} phagocytic activity of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated human monocytes. Main methodsTHP- 1 monocytes were incubated with L-AMB, ITC or ANI and LPS. Gene expression levels of cytokines (TNF-, IL- 1, IL- 6, and IL- 10) were measured after 2 h, 6 h, and 24 h. Cytokine protein levels were evaluated after 24 h and phagocytic activity was determined following co-incubation with Escherichia coli. Key findingsAll <b>antimycotics</b> differentially modulated the gene and protein expression of cytokines in sepsis-like conditions. In the presence of LPS, we identified L-AMB as immunosuppressive, whereas ITC demonstrated pro-inflammatory properties. Both compounds induced remarkably less phagocytosis. SignificanceOur study suggests that <b>antimycotics</b> routinely used in septic patients alter the immune response in sepsis-like conditions by modulating cytokine gene and protein expression levels and phagocytic activity. Future treatment strategies should consider the immune status of the host and apply <b>antimycotics</b> accordingly in bacterial septic patients with secondary fungal infections...|$|R
40|$|Background: Drug {{induced liver injury}} (DILI) is {{the most}} common cause of liver injury and a rare but serious {{clinical}} problem. The hepatotoxicity of many drugs – including the <b>antimycotics</b> – is poorly screened in human models. <b>Antimycotics</b> are involved in approximately 3 % of DILI cases. Primary human hepatocytes and hepatoma cell lines are estimated in vitro model systems for hepatotoxicity studies. Methods: We compared the response of primary human hepatocytes (two donors, 50, 000 cells/ 96 -well, medium, 24 h) and an established in-vitro cytotoxicity assay with a standardized permanent cell line (HepG 2 /C 3 A, 500, 000 cells/ 24 -well, medium, 144 h) incubated with different concentrations of <b>antimycotics</b> (anidulafungin, caspofungin and fluconazole). We determinated the cell viability (XTT, MTT) and CYP 1 A 2 activity (EROD-test). The lowest test concentration of <b>antimycotics</b> was the mean plasma levels after induction of an i. v. therapy (Cmax), as well as the 5 -times and 10 -times concentrations of Cmax were analysed (+ negative control: medium and positive control: acetaminophen). Results: In both models all <b>antimycotics</b> are associated with slightly hepatotoxicity in the Cmax concentration; Anidulafungin showed a stronger hepatotoxicity in higher concentration in the MTT/XTT-test. The activity of the CYP 1 A 2 -enzyme was not affected by anidulafungin; in contrast, fluconazol and caspofungin led to a significantly lower activity in all concentrations in both cell-models. Conclusion: The standardised cytotoxicity assay with the permanent cell line C 3 A showed the similar results in hepatotoxicity-testing of <b>antimycotics</b> as primary human hepatocytes and may represents cost effective tool for hepatotoxicity-testing...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{frequency}} of potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) and adverse drug events (ADEs) associated with <b>antimycotics</b> in hospitalized patients with hematopoietic SCT (HSCT). Of the 120 HSCT recipients evaluated, 36 received <b>antimycotics.</b> A total of 124 ADEs were recorded in 32 of the 36 patients treated, with 54 ADEs being possibly and 9 probably related to <b>antimycotics.</b> Of the treatments with amphotericin B, 93 % were associated with one or more possible and 36 % with probable ADEs. The corresponding figures for lipid-based amphotericin B were 100 % and 7 %, for voriconazole 68 % and 11 % and for caspofungin 70 % and 0 %. A total of 57 potentially severe DDIs associated with <b>antimycotics</b> were detected in 31 of the 36 patients. Of these, 14 DDIs were a possible cause of an ADE and 5 (4 times a combination of voriconazole with CYA and once a combination of CYA with conventional amphotericin B) were probably related. Although the prevalence of pDDIs and ADEs is high in HSCT patients, ADEs related with a high probability to treatment with <b>antimycotics</b> are rare. Regarding the high prevalence of pDDIs, our findings underscore the importance of close monitoring of laboratory and clinical parameters, as well as dose adjustment for critical drugs, in patients with HSCT...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} the human {{immunodeficiency}} virus and the increasing prevalence of immunocompromised individuals in the community {{have resulted in a}} resurgence of opportunistic infections, including oral candidoses.

40|$|Purpose. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is {{the most}} common cause of liver injury and a serious {{clinical}} problem; <b>antimycotics</b> are involved in approximately 3 % of all DILI cases. The hepatotoxicity of many drugs, including the <b>antimycotics,</b> is poorly screened in human models. Methods. In a standardized assay the cytotoxicity on hepatocytes of different concentrations (Cmax, 5 x Cmax, and 10 x Cmax) of the <b>antimycotics</b> used for systemic infections was tested. Anidulafungin (ANI), liposomal amphotericerin B (L-AmB), caspofungin (CASPO), fluconazole (FLUCO), and voriconazole (VORI) were incubated with HepG 2 /C 3 A cells. After incubation, the viability of cells (XTT test, LDH release, trypan blue staining), the synthesis of albumin, the cytochrome 1 A 2 activity, and the cell death (DNA fragmentation) were determined. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann–Whitney tests were used for statistical analyses. Results. L-AmB, ANI, and CASPO showed a mild hepatotoxicity in the Cmax concentrations. Higher concentrations of anidulafungin led to a severe impairment of hepatocyte viability and function. The azoles FLUCO and VORI had a higher hepatotoxic potential in all concentrations. Conclusion. <b>Antimycotics,</b> especially azoles, used for systemic infections should be given with caution in patient with liver insufficiency or liver failure or high risk for this; therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring should be used. Further studies with this approach are encouraged...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although the {{phospholipase}} {{activity is}} considered a potential virulence determinant of the pathogenic Candida species, the effect of <b>antimycotics</b> on this attribute is not known. Hence we evaluated the phospholipase activity in 10 isolates each of Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis, after their exposure to antifungals. METHODS: The impact of <b>antimycotics</b> on phospholipase activity was also assessed after exposure of the isolates to sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations of nystatin, amphotericin B and fluconazole. RESULTS: All Candida isolates investigated exhibited phospholipase activity (Pz). In general C. ALBICANS showed relatively higher P(z) activity than C. tropicalis, and exposure of the isolates to <b>antimycotics</b> led to a significant (p < 0. 05) reduction in the phospholipase activity. Nystatin and amphotericin B, but not fluconazole, significantly reduced the phospholipase activity of both Candida species. CONCLUSION: These observations, while confirming the higher virulence of C. albicans relative to C. tropicalis, demonstrate {{for the first time}} the effect of antifungal agents on extracellular phospholipases of these common opportunistic pathogens.

Therefore, we used an established in-vitro test with a standardised permanent cell line and tested the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen and of systemic <b>antimycotics.</b> Methods: In a standardised mikrotiterplate assay the toxicity of different concentrations of acetaminophen (AM 7. 62 mM | 15. 24 mM) and of the <b>antimycotics</b> Anidulafungin (Ani), Liposomal Amphotericerin B (L-AmB), Fluconazole (Fluco)) were tested with human liver cells (HepG 2 /C 3 A, 500, 000 cells/well; medium). The lowest test concentration of <b>antimycotics</b> was the mean plasma levels after induction of an i. v. therapy (Cmax), as well as the 5 -times and 10 -times concentrations of Cmax were analyzed. As controls served plasma with the different agents and a plasma plus medium control without agents (Control Group = CG). After incubation time of 2 × 3 days the standard parameters of vitality (e. g.

Results: (Median, 25 / 75 percentile) : All <b>antimycotics</b> and AM showed a decreased vitality [%] (L-AmB 73, 66 / 77 | Ani 80, 76 / 82 | Fluco 75, 72 / 79) in the Cmax-concentration compared with the CG (94, 92 / 95) with corresponding increased LDH release [U/l] (L-AmB 70, 63. 5 / 90. 25 | Ani 66, 58. 5 / 82. 5 | Fluco 144, 107. 75 / 182. 25 | CG 70. 5, 54 / 97 | AM 192, 163. 75 / 214. 5). With increasing concentrations of Ani a markedly decrease of cell vitality was seen; in contrast, Fluco und L-AmB showed a slightly increase. Comparing to the CG, AM, Fluco and L-AmB led to a significant lower number of DNA positive cells [%] (L-AmB 0. 6, 0. 2 / 1. 1 | Fluco 4. 9, 4. 5 / 5. 3 | CG 3. 7, 1. 7 / 8. 4 | AM 2. 3, 1. 4 / 17. 4). The number of DNA positive cells increased significantly in the Ani-group (10 × Cmax 58, 48. 1 / 70). Conclusion: All <b>antimycotics</b> showed a slightly hepatotoxic potential in the Cmax concentration; Ani a stronger hepatotoxicity in higher concentrations.
