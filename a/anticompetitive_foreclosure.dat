Vertical relations may have both welfare increasing and welfare reducing effects. In this study, {{we focus on the}} latter, in particular on <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>foreclosure.</b> We distinguish three possible mechanisms that may lead to <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>foreclosure,</b> called respectively 'exclusivity', 'sabotage', and the 'waterbed effect'. We discuss under which conditions they come into play and which policy measures can prevent them. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{papers have}} shown {{conditions}} under which vertical, mergers can result in <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>foreclosure</b> of unintegrated rivals. These models imply that a necessary but not sufficient condition for <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>foreclosure</b> is that unintegrated rivals are less profitable after a vertical merger. We test this hypothesis by examining the stock prices of unintegrated rivals {{at the time of}} a vertical merger announcement and at the time of a government antitrust complaint. We find no evidence to support the foreclosure hypothesis. *Vice President and Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, an...|$|E

40|$|The FCC’s net {{neutrality}} rules sought to limit interference by broadband service providers in markets for Internet-based content and applications. But to do so, the Commission significantly reduced {{the amount of}} innovation possible in the broadband service market. Within limits, broadband providers may offer different plans that vary the quantity of service available to customers, {{as well as the}} quality of that service. But they generally cannot vary the service itself: with limited exceptions, broadband providers must offer customers access to all lawful Internet traffic, or none at all. This Article explores the way in which this all-or-nothing homogenization of the American broadband product differs from innovative experiments taking place in other countries. In various parts of the world, customers are offered several alternatives to the unlimited Internet model, including social media plans, feature phone partnerships, bundled apps, and free premium content. It also examines the positive role that vertical agreements may play when promoting innovation and competition within a market. Undoubtedly, the FCC can and should intervene to stop anticompetitive practices, including <b>anticompetitive</b> vertical <b>foreclosure.</b> But these determinations should be made on a case-by-case basis based on proof of market power and consumer harm. This approach would allow wireless providers to experiment with new and different Internet business models without risking an unnecessary regulatory response...|$|R
40|$|The {{competition}} {{policy in the}} EU should guarantee that the competition is not distorted {{in the way that}} would prevent or create difficulties for the free mobility of goods and services between Member states. It is prohibited for companies to abuse their dominant position according to Article 82, if it affects trade. The essence of Article 82 is control of market power. The perfect competition results when supply and demand appoint the price and quantity of a product. Firms are encouraged to compete then it results in efficiency, quality products and lower prices. Dominance can be assessed only in relation to three essential variables: the product market, the geographical market and the temporal factor. The determination of the relevant product market is crucial. The general approach of the Commission and the Court to the definition of the product market has been to focus upon interchangeability, {{the extent to which the}} product is interchangeable with other products. From the demand side interchangeability requires investigation of cross-elasticities of the product. The existence of high cross-elasticities indicates that the products are part of the same market. There are different types of abuse, for example price discrimination, refusal to supply and predatory pricing. In Tetra Pak the ECJ held that the company that was a world leader in the manufacture of aseptic cartons for liquid and semi-liquid food had abused its dominant position on the market for aseptic cartons. Tetra Pak asserted that only their products could be used in production when using their machines. Their behaviour, according to ECJ, was abusive then they tried to tie-in consumers and customers. This way of behaviour could also be seen in the Hilti-case concerning nail guns. Tying occurs when the supplier makes the sale of one product (the tying product) conditional upon the purchase of another distinct product (the tied product) from the supplier or someone designated by the latter. Tying is common practice that often has no <b>anticompetitive</b> consequences. The <b>foreclosure</b> of the tied market may allow the dominant company to achieve larger profits in the tied market. We can see the importance of case-law, when the definition of Article 82 is broad. For example have the United Brands-case and Akzo-case determined the presumption for market share and dominant position. The case-law will grow larger through the years and we think it will be clearer for companies what is allowed and forbidden. The problem today is that the competition law is rather indistinct...|$|R
40|$|Recently, federal {{regulators}} responsible for enforcing the antitrust laws {{have shown a}} renewed interest in the potential anticompetitive effects of vertical mergers [...] mergers between two independent firms in successive stages of production. This greater activism in vertical merger cases is in striking contrast to the permissive policies that prevailed throughout the 1980 s, which, in turn, were a response to the Justice Department's and the Federal Trade Commission's open hostility to vertical mergers during the 1960 s and 1970 s. > The cyclical antitrust treatment of vertical mergers over the past three and one-half decades has been strongly influenced by the theoretical research of academic economists and lawyers. This article examines the empirical evidence of <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>foreclosure</b> in vertical mergers challenged by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission during the period from 1963 to 1982. The authors find no evidence of anticompetitive market foreclosure for the sample of vertical merger cases challenged by the antitrust agencies during this period. They suggest that a more permissive policy towards vertical mergers be maintained until the theory can spell out more clearly the circumstances when vertical mergers result in <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>foreclosure.</b> Antitrust law; Consolidation and merger of corporations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the nature of}} upstream rivalry in non-linear supply contracts with and without exclusive dealing. We find that foreclosure can occur without exclusive dealing, if economies of scale are sufficiently large, {{as well as with}} exclusive dealing. Surprisingly, however, it is the retailer and not the upstream firms who benefit. This formalizes the view that exclusive dealing will not be initiated by supplier because retailer compensation is too steep. It also implies that <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>foreclosure</b> is more likely to occur when downstream firms have bargaining power...|$|E
40|$|As the European Commission’s {{antitrust}} investigation against Google approaches {{its final}} stages, its contours and likely outcome remain obscure and blurred by {{a plethora of}} non antitrust-related arguments. At the same time, the initial focus on search neutrality as an antitrust principle {{seems to have been}} abandoned by the European Commission, in favour of a more standard allegation of ‘exclusionary abuse’, likely to generate <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>foreclosure</b> of Google’s rivals. This paper discusses search neutrality as an antitrust principle, and then comments on the current investigation based on publicly available information. The paper provides a critical assessment of the likely tests that will be used for the definition of the relevant product market, the criteria for the finding of dominance, the <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>foreclosure</b> test and the possible remedies that the European Commission might choose. Overall, and regardless of the outcome of the Google case, the paper argues that the current treatment of exclusionary abuses in Internet markets is in urgent need of a number of important clarifications, and has been in this condition for more than a decade. The hope is that the European Commission will resist the temptation to imbue the antitrust case with an emphasis and meaning {{that have nothing to do}} with antitrust (from industrial policy motives to privacy, copyright or media law arguments) and that, on the contrary, the Commission will devote its efforts to sharpening its understanding of dynamic competition in cyberspace, and the tools that should be applied in the analysis of these peculiar, fast-changing and often elusive settings...|$|E
40|$|This article aims to {{introduce}} the Guidance Paper’s key features in applying Article 82 EC to abusive exclusionary conduct by dominant undertakings. It will therefore examine the concepts of consumer welfare, <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>foreclosure,</b> consumer harm, the efficiency-based defence and balancing test, and some issues that apply to predation and tying. It will also discuss how the Guidance Paper could be perceived {{from the perspective of}} German competition law and policy and what kind of transitional regime might be required for the effective implementation of its major analytical concepts. The central issue is therefore to answer the questions of how efficient it really is to reform Article 82 by means of a soft-law instrument, and whether the GP presents an efficient means of compliance for Germany...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel method for examining {{the effects of}} vertical integration. The basic idea is to estimate the parameters of a vertical entry game. By carefully specifying firms ’ payoff equations and constructing appropriate tests, {{it is possible to}} use estimates on rival profit effects to make inferences about the existence of vertical foreclosure. I estimate the vertical entry model using data from the US generic pharmaceutical industry. The estimates indicate that vertical integration is unlikely to generate <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>foreclosure</b> effects. On the other hand, significant efficiency effects are found to arise from vertical integration. I use the parameter estimates to simulate a policy that bans vertically integrated entry. The simulation results suggest that such a ban is counterproductive; it is likely to reduce entry into smaller markets...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} from an {{economic}} perspective two alternative views of restrictions of competition by sports associations. The horizontal approach views such restrictions as an agreement among the participants of a sports league with the sports association merely representing an organization executing the horizontal cooperation. In contrast, the vertical approach views the sports association as being a dominant upstream firm enjoying a monopoly position on the market stage for competition organizing services, an important input for the actual product - the sports game. Taking the recent financial fair play (FFP) initiative by UEFA (the Union of European Football Associations) as an example, we demonstrate that the different views lead to different assessments of restrictive effects and, thus, matter for competition policy decisions. The economic story of the potential restrictive effect of FFP on players' and player agents' income may fit more plausibly to the horizontal approach, whereas the potentially <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>foreclosure</b> and deterrence effects of FFP may be economically more soundly reasoned by taking the vertical view...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze and}} {{contrast}} the US and EU antitrust standards on mixed bundling and tying. We apply our analysis to the US and EU cases against Microsoft {{on the issue}} of tying new products (Internet Explorer in the US, and Windows Media Player in the EU) with Windows as well as to cases brought in Europe and in the United States on bundling discounts. We conclude that there are differences between the EC and US antitrust law on the choice of the relevant analogy for bundled rebates (predatory price standard or foreclosure standard) and the implementation of the distinct product and coercion test for tying practices. The second important difference between the two jurisdictions concerns the interpretation of the requirement of <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>foreclosure.</b> It seems to us that in Europe, consumer detriment is found easily and it is not always a requirement for the application of Article 82, or at least that the standard of proof of a consumer detriment for tying cases is lower than in the US. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} and legal view of vertical integration has varied over time, but, a {{constant source of}} concern is the fear that the integrated firm will foreclose competitors from intermediate markets. At the same time, most commentators have considered the economics of vertical contracts, especially exclusive dealing, to be essentially identical to vertical merger. Using the simple model of Comanor and Freeh [Comanor, William S. and Freeh, H. E., III, "The Competitive Effects of Vertical Agreements?" American Economic Review, June 1985, 75, 3, 539 - 46], it is shown that vertical mergers and exclusive dealing contracts are not behaviorally equivalent. In particular, vertical mergers will not lead to foreclosure of rivals for anticompetitive reasons, while ordinary exclusive dealing contracts will lead to such <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>foreclosure.</b> Vertical mergers avoid certain externalities that exclusive dealing contracts create. In this model, vertical mergers can only cause anticompetitive problems through their horizol aspects, by creating a monopoly of distributors. Of course, merger can always be mimicked by a complex enough contract between nominally independent parties. In this model, the contracts that mimic the merger require two parties to agree on the price of a third party's products and are particularly subject to being undermined by price-cutting. Thus, {{it is likely to be}} uncommon. Vertical, Foreclosure, Contracts, Mergers, Restrictions,...|$|E
40|$|Protection of {{business}} competition - Abuse of dominant position The main {{objective of this}} thesis is a comprehensive analysis of the term "abuse. " In a wider complex, thesis deals with {{a question of the}} present aim and prevailing method of application of provision 102 TFEU in order to find out whether and if yes, to what extent is current approach compatible with the modernization process of the application of article 102 TFEU declared by the Commission. Thesis deals with a question whether decisional practise is capable to react on a challenge made by so called new economy sector. Thesis consists of five substantial chapters. The first chapter sums up historical development of the 102 prohibition in Europe and USA law with a particular focus on the objective behind the text of the relevant provisions and decisions and its changes in time. The second chapter zooms to modernization process in relation to Art. 102. The central chapter analyses in detail the features of the general definition of an abuse arising from the decision of Hoffmann-La Roche, namely: i) a special responsibility of the undertaking; ii) the objective nature of the abuse and the effect of conduct on competition; iii) competition on the merits. An analysis of the concept of <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>foreclosure</b> follows. The concept of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of the 1992 Cable Television Act, the FCC set out {{regulations}} intended to encourage competition to established cable operators by insuring that alternative multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs), such as MMDS, SMATV, DBS, and 2 ̆ 2 overbuilt 2 ̆ 2 cable systems have access to programming on the same terms and conditions as established cable operators. The FCC 2 ̆ 7 s specific regulations, however, apply only to program suppliers in which any cable operator has a 5 percent or greater equity interest. These vertically integrated programmers are prohibited from any price discrimination in any market (except for differences the programmer can justify on the basis of costs), or from exclusive contracting with any cable operator unless the program supplier can demonstrate to the FCC that such contracts are in the public interest. The Author argues that whatever the net benefit of program access regulations may be in general, separate treatment of integrated and nonintegrated program suppliers is not justified. The empirical record makes clear that both integrated and nonintegrated suppliers engage in the same potentially <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>foreclosure</b> behavior involving exclusive dealing. Empirical evidence that program suppliers charge consistently higher input prices to alternative MVPDs appears to be unrelated to vertical integration. To the extent that cost factors are not responsible, these differences can be explained, not by vertical foreclosure, but by variation in outcomes of the bilateral input price-setting process between program suppliers and MVPDs having varying degrees of bargaining power in the programming market. The Author concludes that any program access regulations should apply equally to integrated and nonintegrated program suppliers. One result of unequal treatment is likely to be evasion of the regulations by means of vertical divestiture, further undermining the intent of the regulations and sacrificing the benefits of vertical ownership to programming innovation and financial support. Finally, the Author comments briefly on recent FCC program access decisions...|$|E
