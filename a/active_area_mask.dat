40|$|Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) is {{the most}} {{promising}} solution for technology nodes 16 nm (hp) and below. However, several unique EUV mask challenges must be resolved for a successful launch of the technology into the market. Uncontrolled introduction of particles and/or contamination into the EUV scanner significantly increases the risk for device yield loss and potentially scanner down-time. With {{the absence of a}} pellicle to protect the surface of the EUV mask, a zero particle adder regime between final clean and the point-of-exposure is critical for the <b>active</b> <b>areas</b> of the <b>mask.</b> A Dual Pod concept for handling EUV masks had been proposed by the industry as means to minimize the risk of mask contamination during transport and storage. SÜSS-HamaTech introduces MaskTrackPro InSync as a fully automated solution for the handling of EUV masks in and out of this Dual Pod System and therefore constitutes an interface between various tools inside the Fab. The intrinsic cleanliness of each individual handling and storage step of the inner shell (EIP) of this Dual Pod and the EUV mask inside the InSync Tool has been investigated to confirm the capability for minimizing the risk of cross-contamination. An Entegris Dual Pod EUV- 1000 A-A 110 has been used for the qualification. The particle detection for the qualification procedure was executed with the TNO's RapidNano Particle Scanner, qualified for particle sizes down to 50 nm (PSL equivalent). It has been shown that the target specification of < 2 particles @ 60 nm per 25 cycles has been achieved. In case where added particles were measured, the EIP has been identified as a potential root cause for Ni particle generation. Any direct Ni-Al contact has to be avoided to mitigate the risk of material abrasion. © 2011 SPIE...|$|R

In this work, a detailed study of organic photovoltaic devices with active layer based on poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) and 1 -(3 -methoxycarbonyl) -propyl- 1 -phenyl-(6, 6) C 61 (PCBM) is made, evaluating the effect of the change on the <b>active</b> <b>area</b> from 10 − 2 to 4 [*]cm 4. The device structure was kept simple in order to allow the understanding of the physical effects involved. Device figures of merit were extracted from the equivalent circuit using a genetic-based algorithm, and their relationship with the <b>active</b> <b>area</b> was compared. It is observed that the efficiency drops significantly with the <b>active</b> <b>area</b> increase (as the fill factor) while the parallel and series resistance, adjusted to the <b>active</b> <b>area,</b> seems to be relatively constant and increases linearly, respectively. The short circuit current and the generated photocurrent also drop significantly with the <b>active</b> <b>area</b> increase. The open circuit voltage does not show major changes. These results are discussed considering the main influences for the observed efficiency data. Particularly, as the basic circuit model seems to fail to explain the macroscopic results, the behavior can be related with the enlargement of defect interaction...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} {{characterization of the}} <b>active</b> <b>area</b> uniformity of InGaAs/InP Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) from two different design iterations. Nonuniformity of the electric field within the device <b>active</b> <b>area</b> has been measured through 2 -D scans of detection efficiency and timing response to a pulsed laser. Additionally, we measured the near-infrared luminescence emitted by hot carriers during the avalanche. The nonuniformity is stronger at lower excess bias, with much higher and nonuniform electric field {{at the edge of}} the <b>active</b> <b>area</b> than expected, and it is fainter at higher excess bias, due to the saturation of the avalanche triggering efficiency. The main drawbacks are that the detection efficiency is position dependent when the SPAD is not fiber pigtailed and that the temporal response is worse, because of the nonuniform delay in the avalanche build-up across the SPAD <b>active</b> <b>area...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a new {{approach}} of changing the flow field <b>active</b> <b>area</b> with changing operating conditions is analyzed and discussed. In order to change the <b>active</b> <b>area,</b> two special cathode plates with interdigitated and serpentine flow fields were designed and tested. Each flow field is divided into six separate sections, which are connected to valves (open or closed manually). Reducing the <b>active</b> <b>area</b> in the low power region increases the effective current density (hence lower voltage) and increases the effective reactant flow and associated pressure drop. However, the absolute current and flow do not change from the normal situation for the full <b>active</b> <b>area.</b> Thus, improved fuel cell stack performance stability is achieved without increasing the parasitic load significantly. In addition, other direct benefits of this {{new approach}} for future fuel cell designs could include improved cell-to-cell reactant distribution, reduced low current density failure modes, and overall system advantages...|$|R
