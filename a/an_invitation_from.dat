5|$|A further {{cause of}} the Lombard {{migration}} into Italy may have been <b>an</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>from</b> Narses. According to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources, Narses, out of spite for having been removed by Justinian's successor Justin II, called the Lombards to Italy. Often dismissed as an unreliable tradition, it has been studied with attention by modern scholars, in particular Neil Christie, who see in it a possible record of a formal invitation by the Byzantine state to settle in northern Italy as foederati, to help protect the region against the Franks, an arrangement {{that may have been}} disowned by Justin II after Narses' removal.|$|E
5|$|Back in Uppsala, Linnaeus' {{relations}} with Nils Rosén worsened, and thus he gladly accepted <b>an</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>from</b> the student Claes Sohlberg {{to spend the}} Christmas holiday in Falun with Sohlberg's family.

Sohlberg's father suggested to Linnaeus he should bring Sohlberg to the Dutch Republic and continue to tutor him there for an annual salary. At that time, the Dutch Republic {{was one of the}} most revered places to study natural history and a common place for Swedes to take their doctoral degree; Linnaeus, who was interested in both of these, accepted.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, Walton was {{presented}} with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted <b>an</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>from</b> the BBC to compose his first opera.

Two weeks after {{returning}} to Canada, he accepted <b>an</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>from</b> the International Wrestling Association of Japan (IWA Japan). While in Japan, he achieved his dream of wrestling in Tokyo's Korakuen Hall. Three months later, World Championship Wrestling was taping WCW Thunder in Kelowna, British Columbia and recruited Juggernaut and three other local wrestlers for a match. They faced KroniK in a handicap match with a two-minute time limit. KroniK won the match in one minute and forty-nine seconds, pinning Juggernaut after performing the High Times.|$|E
5|$|In May 1919, upon {{receiving}} <b>an</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>from</b> fellow Jewish artist Marc Chagall, Lissitzky {{returned to}} Vitebsk to teach graphic arts, printing, and architecture at {{the newly formed}} People's Art School– a school that Chagall created after being appointed Commissioner of Artistic Affairs for Vitebsk in 1918. Lissitzky was engaged in designing and printing propaganda posters; later, he preferred to keep quiet about this period, probably because one of main subjects of these posters was the exile Leon Trotsky. The quantity of these posters is sufficient to regard them as a separate genre in the artist's output.|$|E

5|$|Isabelle Wilhelmine Marie Eberhardt (17 February 1877– 21 October 1904) was a Swiss {{explorer}} and writer.

She dressed as a man and converted to Islam, eventually adopting the name Si Mahmoud Saadi. Eberhardt's unorthodox behaviour made her an outcast among European settlers in Algeria and the French administration.|$|E
