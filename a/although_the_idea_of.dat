5|$|In 997, at a royal meeting near Clonfert, Brian Boru, King of Munster, {{met with}} his long-time rival Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill, {{who was at the}} time High King of Ireland. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the high-kingship is {{considered}} mainly an anachronistic invention, it came into vogue in the 10th century to denote a king who had enforced his power over external territories. Máel Sechnaill assumed the Irish high-kingship after the Battle of Tara in 980.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for {{a railway}} between Oslo and Drammen were {{launched}} in 1864 and planning commenced two years later. This involved deciding upon {{the location of}} the stations. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> placing one at the municipal centre of Sandvika was not met with protest, there was not consensus regarding the other and both Østre Stabekk and Lysaker were proposed. The latter was selected by the municipal council because of its vicinity to the Oslofjord and being located next to a waterfall.|$|E
5|$|Music took on {{a pivotal}} and {{permanent}} role in Einstein's life from that period on. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become {{a regular part of}} his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Köchel catalogue of Mozart's work; that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein, who may have been a distant relation.|$|E
50|$|The Every Vote Counts Amendment was shutdown. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ideas</b> <b>of</b> Every Vote Counts Amendment led to H.J Res.36, another {{electoral college}} reform {{proposal}} {{that included a}} direct popular election.

5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal health {{insurance}} coverage to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him {{at the start of}} his term that doing so would be the best way he could help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules of Medicaid funding, threatened to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts if the state did not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of health care services. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money spent by the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{becoming}} a marine zoologist interested him, Franco had always secretly {{wanted to become}} an actor but feared being rejected. He enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as an English major, but dropped out after his first year against his parents' wishes {{to pursue a career}} as an actor, since {{he would have had to}} wait two years to audition for their acting program. Franco instead chose to take acting lessons with Robert Carnegie at the Playhouse West. Around this time, Franco took up a late-night job at McDonald's to support himself because his parents refused to do so. He was a vegetarian until working there. While working at the establishment, he would practice accents on customers, an experience he remembered nostalgically in a 2015 Washington Post editorial ("McDonald’s was there for me when no one else was").|$|E
5|$|In his 1988 book Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, the {{freelance}} dinosaurologist Gregory Paul {{proposed that}} A. fragilis had tall pointed horns and a slender build {{compared to a}} postulated second species A. atrox, and was not a different gender due to rarity. Allosaurus atrox was originally named by Marsh in 1878 as the type species of its own genus, Creosaurus, {{and is based on}} YPM 1890, an assortment of bones including a couple of pieces of the skull, portions of nine tail vertebrae, two hip vertebrae, an illium, and ankle and foot bones. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> two common Morrison allosaur species was followed in some semi-technical and popular works, the 2000 thesis on Allosauridae noted that Charles Gilmore mistakenly reconstructed USNM 4734 as having a shorter skull than the specimens referred by Paul to atrox, refuting supposed differences between USNM 4734 and putative A. atrox specimens like DINO 2560, AMNH 600, and AMNH 666.|$|E
50|$|Fascism in South America was an {{assortment}} of political parties and movements modelled on fascism. Although originating and primarily associated with Europe, the ideology crossed the Atlantic Ocean between the world wars and had an influence on South American politics. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> Falangism probably had the deepest impact in South America, largely due to Hispanidad, more generic fascism was also {{an important factor in}} regional politics.|$|R
25|$|Gary T. Alexander {{has criticized}} the {{relationship}} between transpersonal psychology and <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> William James. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> James are considered central to the transpersonal field, Alexander thought that transpersonal psychology {{did not have a}} clear understanding of the negative dimensions of consciousness (such as evil) expressed in James' philosophy. This serious criticism has been absorbed by later transpersonal theory, which has been more willing to reflect on these important dimensions of human existence.|$|R

5|$|At {{about ten}} years of age, Narayan learned the basics of dhrupad, the oldest genre of Hindustani {{classical}} music, by studying and imitating the practice of sarangi player Uday Lal of Udaipur, a student of dhrupad singers Allabande and Zakiruddin Dagar. After Uday Lal died of old age, Narayan met travelling singer Madhav Prasad, originally of Lucknow, who had performed at the court of Maihar. With Prasad, Narayan enacted the ganda bandhan, a traditional ceremony of acceptance between a teacher and his pupil, in which Narayan swore obedience in exchange for being maintained by Prasad. He served Prasad and was taught in khyal, the predominate genre of Hindustani classical music, but returned to Udaipur after four years to teach music school. Prasad later visited Narayan and convinced him to resign his position and dedicate his time to improvement as a musician, <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> giving up a steady life was not well received by Narayan's family. He stayed with Prasad and travelled to several Indian states until Prasad fell ill and advised him to learn from singer Abdul Wahid Khan in Lahore. Following Prasad's death in Lucknow, Narayan enacted the ganda bandhan with another teacher who gave him lessons, but soon left for Lahore and never performed the ritual again.|$|E
5|$|Minas Geraes was christened by Senhora Regis de Oliveira, {{the wife}} of the Brazilian {{minister}} to Great Britain, and launched at Newcastle-on-Tyne on 10 September 1908. During fitting-out, it was moved to Vickers' Walker Yard, and thousands turned out to see the incomplete ship squeeze barely underneath and through overhead and swing bridges. After completion, Minas Geraes was handed over by Armstrong on 5 January to the Brazilian Commission on behalf of the Brazilian government, while the ship's company was mustered on deck. The British Royal Navy carried out its gunnery trials at the request of Armstrong's and with the agreement of the Brazilian government. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> having superfiring turrets was not new—the American s were also designed and built in this fashion around the same time—the trials attracted interest from a few nations, who sent representatives to observe. They wanted to resolve two major questions: the effect that firing the upper superfiring turrets would have on the crewmen in the lower guns, and whether smoke from the discharge of the lower guns would hinder the targeting capabilities of the upper turret. The tests resolved both questions satisfactorily.|$|E
25|$|<b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> romanizing Urdu {{had been}} {{suggested}} several times, it was General Ayub Khan who most seriously suggested adopting the Roman script for Urdu and all Pakistani languages during his {{rule of the}} country.

40|$|Note {{from the}} Deputy Editor: This article, {{although}} not necessarily directly China-Africa related, gives {{an insight into}} the policy environment in an African state after colonialism. The paper explores the driving mechanisms behind Ghana‟s {{foreign policy in the}} post-colonial era as it “switched between East and West”. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> “the West ” and “the East ” have lost much of their Cold War era logic, some states such as Zimbabwe have also seen a discussion, in the present day, on a “Look East ” policy, in contrast to dependence on Breton Woods institutions...|$|R
50|$|In 1816, Auburn Prison (now the Auburn Correctional Facility) {{was founded}} {{as a model}} for <b>the</b> {{contemporary}} <b>ideas</b> about treating prisoners, known now as the Auburn system. Visitors were charged a fee for viewing the facility and its inmates. On August 6, 1890, the first execution by the electric chair was carried out at Auburn Prison. In 1901 Leon Czolgosz, assassin of President William McKinley, was executed there. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Auburn System have been abandoned, the prison continues to serve as a maximum security facility, {{and is one of the}} most secure prisons in the continental United States.|$|R

25|$|<b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{digging a}} mill race (man-made canal) was put forth in 1835 {{it was not}} until 1843 that a dam and the East and West Races were constructed. The {{construction}} was done by the South Bend Manufacturing Company, incorporated in December 1842 for this very purpose. The South Bend Manufacturing Company thus became owner of the water power rights on the West Race canal, while Samuel L. Cottrell purchased the water rights along the East Race canal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> doing a {{straight}} re-release {{of the game}} initially seemed like {{a straight}}-forward task, the implementation proved somewhat more complicated, due to the different architectures of a PC and a DS. For example, to get the graphics to look identical to their 1996 incarnation, {{they had to be}} completely rewritten for the new device; behind the replication of the original's 2D isometric graphics, a 3D game engine is running, which must convert the graphics in real time.|$|E
25|$|The term {{universal}} grammar (or UG) {{is used for}} the innate biological properties of the human brain, whatever exactly they turn out to be, that are responsible for children's rapid and overwhelmingly successful acquisition of a native language, without any obvious effort, during {{the first few years of}} life. The person most strongly associated with the scientific investigation of UG is Noam Chomsky, <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Universal Grammar has clear historical antecedents at least as far back as the 1600s, in the form of the Port-Royal Grammar.|$|E

40|$|Model driven {{architecture}} (MDA) {{concentrates on}} the use of models during software development. An approach using models as the central development artifact is more abstract, more compact and thus more effective and probably also less error prone. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> MDA exist already for years, there is still much to improve in the development process as well as the underlying techniques and tools. Therefore, this paper is a follow up on [13], reexamining und updating the statements made there.

25|$|Rice {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} a musical based on the subject to Lloyd Webber, but <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> writing a score including tangos, pasos dobles, and similar Latin flavours intrigued him, Lloyd Webber ultimately rejected the idea. He decided instead to collaborate with Alan Ayckbourn on Jeeves, a traditional Rodgers and Hart-style musical based on the P. G. Wodehouse character, which proved to be a critical and commercial failure. After Jeeves, Lloyd Webber returned to Rice, and they began developing Rice's proposed musical.|$|E
25|$|The Permanent Court of International Justice, {{often called}} the World Court, existed from 1922 to 1946. It was an {{international}} court attached to the League of Nations. Created in 1920 (<b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an international court was several centuries old), the Court was initially well-received from states and academics alike, with many cases submitted to it for its first decade of operation.

He encouraged her to let some of her nails grow a little longer before biting them, so that she really could derive the fullest pleasure from the activity. She decided to grow all of her nails long enough that she might really enjoy biting them, and then, after some days, she realised that she didn't want to bite them anyway.|$|E

After the uprising broke down due to internal politics in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, she established in the Rzeczpospolita, a system of government fully controlled by the Russian Empire through a Permanent Council, under the supervision of her ambassadors and envoys.|$|E
25|$|Linda Dugeau and Dot Robinson co-founded Motor Maids with 51 {{members and}} a dream. She took {{interest}} {{in the idea of}} creating a women’s group in the 1930s and took the liberty to reach out to motorcycle dealerships, AMA clubs and fellow riders in search to find women riders who would take part in helping her form a motorcycle organization of females. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> forming a group took ten years before becoming reality it took Dugeau and her old friend Dot Robinson three of the ten years to find willing female participates to be considered as Motor Maid members. Once the organization found its standing legs the organization expanded quickly, and opportunities to showcase themselves at parades and other events approached them quickly because they had a distinctive image. The Motor Maids organization became very popular throughout the United States of America and president Dot Robinson and secretary Linda Dugeau were ecstatic with the movement they were creating.|$|E
