However, {{in the context of}} the MSSM, they predict too low a value of mh, are frequently in conflict with the measured b → sγ branching fraction and the relic density of thermally produced higgsino-like WIMPs falls well below dark matter (DM) measurements. We propose a framework dubbed radiative natural SUSY (RNS) which can be realized within the MSSM (avoiding the addition of extra exotic matter) and which maintains features such as gauge coupling unification and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking. The RNS model can be generated from SUSY GUT type models with non-universal Higgs masses (NUHM).

By means of the screening theorem, it is shown that the same expressions can be used to get directly from a MSM calculation, the leading Higgs mass contribution to these coefficients at each loop order. In a more general framework, we solve the problems concerning the loss of gauge invariance and the inclusion of only gauge invariant operators by proposing a new formulation of the matching conditions at two and higher loop order. As an example of the usefulness of using an electroweak chiral lagrangian to parametrize the MSM, we will give a simple proof of an extra screening for the renormalized photon self-energy in the on-shell scheme at all orders. In addition it is shown the <b>automatic</b> <b>cancellation</b> of the unphysical M 4 H terms in the other gauge boson self-energies at two-loops in this scheme.
