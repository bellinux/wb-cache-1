Given the short durations, very high velocities and high accelerations encountered with a rocket sled track experiment, highly accurate, high-fidelity instrumentation is critical. Moreover, costly track experiments with destructive impact events require reliable {{operation of the}} instruments. A rocket-mounted <b>acceleration</b> <b>switch</b> has been proposed to detect events in a multi-stage rocket sled track test in order to activate instrumentation before impact. When the switch detects a desired acceleration profile, the switch closes to complete a circuit for instrument activation. Preliminary tests on the proposed switch have shown that statistical variations exist due to practical fabrication and assembly tolerances and that the variations {{can lead to a}} switch that does not respond correctly to the desired acceleration. If the switch does not close at the proper time along the track, improper data may be collected, or no data may be collected before destructive impact in the worst case.

40|$|Device {{encapsulation}} {{and packaging}} often constitutes {{a substantial part}} of the fabrication cost of micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) transducers and imaging sensor devices. In this paper, we propose a simple and cost-effective wafer-level capping method that utilizes a limited number of highly standardized process steps as well as low-cost materials. The proposed capping process is based on low-temperature adhesive wafer bonding, which ensures full complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility. All necessary fabrication steps for the wafer bonding, such as cavity formation and deposition of the adhesive, are performed on the capping substrate. The polymer adhesive is deposited by spray-coating on the capping wafer containing the cavities. Thus, no lithographic patterning of the polymer adhesive is needed, and material waste is minimized. Furthermore, this process does not require any additional fabrication steps on the device wafer, which lowers the process complexity and fabrication costs. We demonstrate the proposed capping method by packaging two different MEMS devices. The two MEMS devices include a vibration sensor and an <b>acceleration</b> <b>switch,</b> which employ two different electrical interconnection schemes. The experimental results show wafer-level capping with excellent bond quality due to the re-flow behavior of the polymer adhesive. No impediment to the functionality of the MEMS devices was observed, which indicates that the encapsulation does not introduce significant tensile nor compressive stresses. Thus, we present a highly versatile, robust, and cost-efficient capping method for components such as MEMS and imaging sensors. QC 20161019 </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development of a sensor for measuring acceleration-thresholds in the low-g-range. The unusual characteristic of this sensor consists of the feature to fabricate the sensor on top of a CMOS signal processing circuit. In this context, the additive electroplating technology combines the advantages of monolithic- and hybrid-integrated sensors with respect to the reduction of interconnections, short development cycles, low tooling costs, and high design flexibility. A detailed technical concept for the fabrication of electroplated micromechanical <b>acceleration</b> <b>switches</b> is presented in this work. It comprises the aspects of the interface technology between the ASIC and the sensor structure, the sensor fabrication and the back-end processing to capsulate the dies. The microswitches are fabricated using microforms, which are moulded by an electroplating process, thus resulting in laterally moveable metallic microstructures. Therefore a low temperature ! dry process was developed to remove the sacrificial resist layer in order to eliminate the dangers of stiction. Other technological improvements were done to increase the yield of the processflow. Therefore optimised technologies considering the electroplating process and the coating of the electrical contacts have been developed. The developed packaging technology enables the hermetic sealing of these micromechanical structures and provides a mechanical overload protection. The additive electroplating technology offers an new fabrication method for a variety of further devices such as coils, interdigitated electrodes, springs and others structures which can be used in various different applications.

The transition from the amorphous state back to the gaseous state upon increasing the plate's acceleration is generally subcritical: An external perturbation applied to one bead initiates a propagating front that produces a rapid transition.

In this paper, we propose a novel emergency vehicle dispatching system to reduce emergency response time, which includes automatic emergency resource assignment and driving path planning to reduce unnecessary time delay caused by human misjudgment or the delay caused by traffic jam. As the traffic condition varies from time to time, the traffic information employed in the proposed method needs to trace back to several weeks prior to the dispatching time. Furthermore, we also propose a lane reservation scheme for emergency vehicles to minimize the crash risks. Before an emergency vehicle arrives at each road segment, Road Side Units start to disseminate the warning message at suitable time, so that other drivers could {{have enough time to}} take proper actions such as speed <b>acceleration</b> or <b>switching</b> lanes.

40|$|The thermohaline {{circulation}} (THC) {{of the oceans}} {{plays a crucial role}} in adjusting the global thermal and hydrological budget in the climate system. Knowledge about its stability and change is very important for understanding the evolution of past climates and assessing possible climate changes in the future. In this study, we investigate the transient and long-term behaviour of the THC, particularly the Southern Ocean overturning in the CSIRO climate model, under increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases (as equivalent CO 2, referred to simply as CO 2) following the IPCC/IS 92 a scenario to stabilisation at three times preindustrial CO 2 (3 x CO 2) then continuing at that level of stabilisation. Firstly the CSIRO ocean model is further developed by modifying the surface boundary forcing, for the purpose of ensuring a stable and realistic ocean climate to be used as the initial condition of the ocean for coupled model climate change studies. The new formulation leads to a significantly improved spinup solution and coupled control climate of the ocean. The world ocean water mass properties, in particular the Southern Ocean stratification, the THC, and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) are all in broad agreement with observations. In the following global warming experiment, pronounced changes of the global THC occur during the CO 2 increase period: the North Atlantic Deep Water Formation (NADWF) weakens rapidly and the Antarctic Bottom Water Formation (AABWF) collapses completely before CO 2 triples. During the subsequent period of 1100 years with stabilised 3 x CO 2, the NADWF intensity shows a tendency to recover gradually in {{the upper part of the}} ocean but the AABWF shows no sign of returning and the residual deep overturning dies away. Also evident is the change of ACC transport under CO 2 forcing: it increases along with the CO 2 increase and keeps increasing steadily for a few centuries after CO 2 tripling. While both the surface freshening and heating from above are responsible for the weakening of NADWF, the surface freshening around Antarctica, including the enhancement of precipitation over evaporation (P - E), runoff from continents and reduction in the sea ice formation and outflux, suppresses the deep convection off Antarctica and causes the shutdown of AABWF. The strengthening of the ACC transport is attributable to the enhanced meridional density contrast across the ACC due to the uneven warming in the Southern Ocean, both at the surface and in the interior. This change in density structure leads to an acceleration in the upper layer currents which outweighs the deceleration in the mid-depth layer caused by the weakening and shutoff of the AABWF. Using the Bryan (1984) technique to accelerate the convergence of the deep ocean towards equilibrium under the 3 x CO 2 condition, it is found that the global THC eventually reaches a near-stable state in which the NADWF is fully recovered, the AABWF is also partly re-established and deep ocean ventilation is activated again. The recovery of the THC is attributed to the slow but persistent warming in the deep ocean which gradually destabilizes the water column. After thousands of years, a stratification structure close to the initial state becomes re-built in the high latitude Southern Ocean, which allows deep convection and hence overturning off Antarctica to occur, bringing the system into a new regime. However, this regime needs some more time to further adjust and settle down to a more stable and slightly different normal mode solution. This is verified by an extension to the accelerated run for 500 years with the <b>acceleration</b> <b>switched</b> off. This result shows the development of a possible new quasi-equilibrium for the ocean under long-term global warming induced by the anthropogenic CO 2 increase. Comparison has been made with the results from an earlier version of the coupled model which has a clearly different initial climate for the ocean. We conclude that, for the CSIRO coupled model (mark 2), the oceanic response to global warming is not strongly dependent on the basic state of the ocean. However, some differences in the oceanic behaviour under CO 2 forcing between the two versions are of scientific interest and have been discussed in detail...|$|R

However, deciphering the mechanistic sources of these effects has been problematic {{due to a lack}} of tools to resolve molecular structures on mineral surfaces during growth. Here we report atomic force microscopy investigations using a system designed to maximize resolution while minimizing contact force. By imaging the growth of calcium-oxalate monohydrate under the influence of aspartic-rich peptides at single-molecule resolution, we reveal how the unique interactions of polypeptides with mineral surfaces lead to <b>acceleration,</b> inhibition, and <b>switching</b> of growth between two distinct states. Interaction with the positively charged face of calcium-oxalate monohydrate leads to formation of a peptide film, but the slow adsorption kinetics and gradual relaxation to a well-bound state result in time-dependent effects. These include a positive feedback between peptide adsorption and step inhibition described by a mathematical catastrophe that results in growth hysteresis, characterized by rapid switching from fast to near-zero growth rates for very small reductions in supersaturation. Interactions with the negatively charged face result in formation of peptide clusters that impede step advancement. The result is a competition between accelerated solute attachment and inhibition due to blocking of the steps by the clusters. The findings have implications for control of pathological mineralization and suggest artificial strategies for directing crystallization...|$|R
40|$|Price {{promotions}} {{are used}} extensively in marketing for one simple reason- consumers respond. The increase in sales of a brand on promotion {{could be due}} to consumers accelerating their purchases (i. e. buying earlier than usual and/or buying more than usual) and/or consumers switching their choice from other brands. Purchase <b>acceleration</b> and brand <b>switching</b> relate to the primary demand and secondary demand effects of a promotion. Gupta (1988) captures these effects in a single model and decomposes a brand's total price elasticity into these components. He reports, for the coffee product category, that the main impact of a price promotion is on brand choice (84 %), {{and to a lesser extent}} on purchase incidence (14 %) and stockpiling (2 %). In other words, the majority of the effect of a promotion is at the secondary level (84 %) and there is a relatively small primary demand effect (16 %). This paper reports the decomposition of total price elasticity for 173 brands across 13 different product categories. On average, we find that 25 % of the elasticity is due to primary demand expansion (i. e., purchase acceleration) and 75 % to secondary demand effects or brand switching. Thus, while Gupta's finding that the majority of promotional response stems from brand switching is true, the actual magnitude of the effect is smaller. More important, there is ample evidence that promotions have a significant primary demand effect. The relative emphasis on purchase <b>acceleration</b> and brand <b>switching</b> varies system-atically across categories. The variation in the decomposition of total elasticity is the focus of the second part of the paper. Promotional response is the consumer's reaction to a price promotion. We therefore develop a framework, based on the consumer's perspective of the benefits from a price promotion, for understanding variability in promotional response. These benefits are posited to be a function of: (i) category-specific factors, (ii) brand-specific factors, and (iii) consumer characteristics. The framework is formalized as a generalized least squares meta analysis in which the brand's price elasticity is the dependent variable. Several interesting results emerge from this analysis. - Category-specific factors, brand-specific factors and consumer demographics explain a significant amount of the variance in promotional response for a brand at both the primary and secondary demand levels. - Category-specific factors have greater influence on variability in promotional response and its decomposition than do brand-specific factors. - There are several instances where exogenous variables do not affect total elasticities yet significantly affect individual components of total elasticity. In fact, the lack of a significant relationship between the variables and total elasticity is often due to offsetting effects within two or more of the three behavioral components of elasticity. This is particularly true for brand-specific factors, which typically have no effect on total elasticity, yet have important effects on the individual behaviors. - There is some evidence to suggest that not all promotion-related increases in primary demand are due to forward-buying - in some cases promotions appear to increase consumption. We use these results to illustrate how category- and brand-specific factors work to drive primary and secondary demand elasticities in different directions. In short, the paper offers an empirical generalization of a key finding on promotional response - how elasticities decompose across brand choice, purchase incidence and stockpiling - and new insights into factors that explain variance in promotional response.

40|$|Price {{promotions}} {{are used}} extensively in marketing for one simple reason—consumers respond. The sales increase for a brand on promotion {{could be due}} to consumers accelerating their purchases (i. e., buying earlier than usual and/or buying more than usual) and/or consumers switching their choice from other brands. Purchase <b>acceleration</b> and brand <b>switching</b> relate to the primary demand and secondary demand effects of a promotion. Gupta (1988) captures these effects in a single model and decomposes a brand's total price elasticity into these components. He reports, for the coffee product category, that the main impact of a price promotion is on brand choice (84 %), {{and that there is a}} smaller impact on purchase incidence (14 %) and stockpiling (2 %). In other words, the majority of the effect of a promotion is at the secondary level (84 %) and there is a relatively small primary demand effect (16 %). This paper reports the decomposition of total price elasticity for 173 brands across 13 different product categories. On average, we find that 25 % of the elasticity is due to primary demand expansion (i. e., purchase acceleration) and 75 % to secondary demand effects or brand switching. Thus, while Gupta's finding that the majority of promotional response stems from brand switching is supported, the average magnitude of the effect appears to be smaller than first thought. More important, there is ample evidence that promotions have a significant primary demand effect. The relative emphasis on purchase <b>acceleration</b> and brand <b>switching</b> varies systematically across categories, and the second goal of the paper is to explain this variation as a function of exogeneous covariates. In doing this, we recognize that promotional response is the consumer's reaction to a price promotion, and therefore develop a framework for understanding variability in promotional response that is based on the consumer's perspective of the benefits from a price promotion. These benefits are posited to be a function of: (i) category-specific factors, (ii) brand-specific factors, and (iii) consumer characteristics. The framework is formalized as a generalized least squares meta-analysis in which the brand's price elasticity is the dependent variable.
