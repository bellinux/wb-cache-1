5|$|Operation Paravane was a British {{air raid}} of World War II that inflicted heavy {{damage on the}} German {{battleship}} Tirpitz. The attack was conducted on 15 September 1944 by 21 Royal Air Force heavy bombers, which flew from an airfield {{in the north of}} the Soviet Union. The battleship was struck by one bomb, and further damaged by several near misses. This damage rendered Tirpitz unfit for combat, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be repaired as it was no longer possible for the Germans to sail her to a major port.|$|E
5|$|Zenobia: {{the wife}} of Odaenathus was accused by the Augustan History of having {{formerly}} conspired with Maeonius, as Hairan I was her stepson <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> accept {{that he was the}} heir to her husband instead of her own children. However, there is no suggestion in the Augustan History that Zenobia was involved in the event that saw her husband's murder; the act is attributed to Maeonius' degeneracy and jealousy. Those accounts by the Augustan History can be dismissed as fiction. The hints in modern scholarship that Zenobia had a hand in the assassination out of her desire to rule the empire and dismay with her husband's pro-Roman policy can be dismissed as there was no reversal of that policy during the first years following Odaenathus' death.|$|E

Five years later, Sufia married Kamaluddin Ahmed.|$|E
25|$|Galla Placidia, as Augusta, {{mother of}} the Emperor, and his {{guardian}} until 437, could maintain a dominant position in court, but women in Ancient Rome did not exercise military power <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> herself become a general. She tried for some years to avoid reliance on a single dominant military figure, maintaining {{a balance of power}} between her three senior officers, Aetius (magister militum in Gaul), Count Boniface governor in the Diocese of Africa, and Flavius Felix magister militum praesentalis in Italy. Meanwhile, the Empire deteriorated seriously. Apart from the losses in the Diocese of Africa, Hispania was slipping out of central control and into the hands of local rulers and Suevic bandits. In Gaul the Rhine frontier had collapsed, the Visigoths in Aquitaine may have launched further attacks on Narbo and Arelate, and the Franks, increasingly powerful although disunited, were the major power in the north-east. Aremorica was controlled by Bagaudae, local leaders not under the authority of the Empire. Aetius at least campaigned vigorously and mostly victoriously, defeating aggressive Visigoths, Franks, fresh Germanic invaders, Bagaudae in Aremorica, and a rebellion in Noricum. Not {{for the first time in}} Rome's history, a triumvirate of mutually distrustful rulers proved unstable. In 427 Felix tried to recall Boniface from Africa; he refused, and overcame Felix's invading force. Boniface probably recruited some Vandal troops among others.|$|E

There, Mary stayed with her daughter for long periods almost every summer. It was here, too, in 1711, that Queen Mary found out that, {{as part of the}} embryonic Treaty of Utrecht, James Francis Edward was to lose Louis XIV's explicit recognition and be forced to leave France. The next year, when James Francis Edward was expelled and Louise Mary died of smallpox, Mary was very upset; according to Mary's close friend Madame de Maintenon, Mary was [...] "a model of desolation". Deprived of the company of her family, Queen Mary lived out the rest of her days at Chaillot and Saint-Germain in virtual poverty, unable to travel by her own means because all her horses had died <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford to replace them.|$|E

500|$|A {{couple of}} months later, Natasha discovers Andrew is {{cheating}} on her with Summer. Natasha is hurt and angry and she lies to Andrew about being pregnant. Of Natasha's rash decision, Novakovic explained [...] "She is hurt and the whole cheating thing has really crushed her. She feels like the fool, no one goes behind her back. And she feels they are pitying her because of her injury [...] and [...] really hates that." [...] Natasha wants Andrew and Summer to feel guilty about betraying her and she wants Andrew for herself. Andrew believes Natasha is pregnant and instead of being with Summer, he decides to stick by Natasha and their baby. Novakovic said that the new storyline is [...] "very exciting" [...] <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> wait to discover the new developments. Novakovic insisted that Natasha is making the plan up as she goes along. She has not thought it out or how the whole situation might end. Her main goal is to keep Andrew and Summer apart because they betrayed and hurt her. Natasha and Andrew attend a pre-natal class together and they get on quite well. During an interview with Digital Spy, Novakovic explained that Natasha is reminded of why she fell for Andrew in the first place, especially when she sees his gentle side. Because Natasha is getting along well Andrew, {{there are times when}} she feels guilty for what she is doing. Natasha does not have any sort of plan to admit the truth as she knows Andrew will be angry.|$|E

500|$|A big storyline {{occurred}} {{for the character}} in 2008, when Phoebe is killed after the car her boyfriend Rick Forrester (Kyle Lowder) was driving crashes. Her death left Steffy [...] "despondent and nearly suicidal". Wood recalled filming the storyline as being tough: [...] "Being a newbie, I was {{up most of the}} night trying to memorize all those monologues." [...] Speaking of emotional scenes where Steffy visited her sister's body in the morgue, the actress noted [...] "She was so tiny and innocent, and to see this beautiful young girl in the morgue, I had to keep my emotions in check. It was challenging. It was such a sad story." [...] Months later, Steffy becomes romantically involved with Rick, who was also previously in a relationship with her mother, Taylor. Reflecting on her initial reaction to the storyline, Wood revealed [...] "Sometimes when you read a script, you're like, 'How am I going [...] do this? How is Steffy going {{to fall in love with}} Rick after he had sex with her sister and their mom?'" [...] She also noted that [...] "I had to play that my fraternal twin is gone, and maybe I am doing this to live her life as well as have fun. She had to fill that void, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> talk to anyone. She lost a part of herself. I have to stress that to the viewers." [...] Wood was [...] "completely shocked" [...] with the speed at which the couple were moving, and said that the romance happened through Phoebe's death because of Steffy's raw feelings. However, she still felt that Steffy was in love with Rick and wanted to give herself to him. Lowder said the couple came together at the [...] "height of their emotions when Phoebe died". While describing the romance as [...] "complete honesty and no games", Wood said Steffy felt if she was close to Rick she could be close to Phoebe.|$|E

Lucy Duff-Gordon noted that for the rest of her husband's life he was brokenhearted over the negative coverage by the [...] "yellow press", during his cross-examination at the inquiry.

2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{characters}} that Madonna developed for the film was a Russian immigrant living in Brooklyn and working in Manhattan, called Evgeni. The character was inspired by Eugene H√ºtz, who played the lead role in Filth and Wisdom. Another motivation behind the project was the celebrity aspect of Edward and Simpson, who {{became the subject of}} intense media scrutiny and public vilification and were ostracised by the Royal Family. Madonna, being interested in the cult of celebrity, found that many of the rumors surrounding Simpson's life are untrue <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> find any empirical evidence supporting them. Hence she wanted to portray Simpson as a human being with flaws, imperfections and a vulnerable side. [...] "The message of the film is to realise that in the end happiness lies in your own head and that we are in fact in charge of our destiny," [...] she said.|$|E
2500|$|In late May 2002, Chr√©tien {{tried to}} curtail Martin's by-then open {{campaign}} for {{the leadership of the}} party by delivering a lecture to Cabinet to stop raising money for leadership bids within the Liberal Party. At what was described as a [...] "stormy" [...] Cabinet meeting on May 30, 2002, Chr√©tien stated that he intended to serve out his entire term, and ordered the end of all leadership fundraising. Martin left his cabinet on June 2, 2002. Martin claimed that Chr√©tien dismissed him from Cabinet, while Chr√©tien said that Martin had resigned. In his memoirs, Chr√©tien wrote that he regretted not having fired Martin a few years earlier. In the aftermath of Martin's departure from the Cabinet, there occurred an angry caucus meeting on June 5, 2002, where much of the caucus came out in support of Martin; demanded that he fire his much hated communications director Fran√ßoise Ducros, who many MPs claimed was impossible to work with, leading to a chorus of MPs chanting [...] "Bring back Peter, bring back Peter" [...] (a reference to Ducros's predecessor Peter Donolo); and several pro-Martin M.Ps asked forthright for Chr√©tien to resign. Liberal MP Dan McTeague told Chr√©tien that [...] "You made a decision for Paul Martin. You should make the same decision for yourself". Many of the MPs accused the PMO of riding roughshod over them, and accused the prime minister of being a bully. Liberal MP Carolyn Parrish recalled about that caucus meeting that she could not believe that [...] "these ungrateful sons of bitches", as she called the pro-Martin MPs, would attack Chr√©tien at a caucus meeting so openly. For Chr√©tien's reaction, Parrish stated: [...] "His face was evil. His eyes were like a shark's eyes", <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> understand why he didn't walk out, saying [...] "Any other person would have, especially knowing that most of those assholes telling you this couldn't get elected dog catcher if they weren't on a Liberal ticket riding on your coattails".|$|E

2500|$|Finally, authors {{with strong}} {{political}} or philosophical points to make {{would no longer}} turn to the stage as their first hope of making a living. Prior to 1737, plays were de rigueur for authors who were not journalists. This {{had to do with}} the economics of booksellers. A bookseller would purchase a book from an author, whether that book was Gulliver's Travels or Collected Sermons, and would calculate his chances of making money off of sales. He would pay the author according to the money he expected to make. [...] (For example, Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield was famously sold to pay a single rent installment, whereas John Gay had been paid 1,000 pounds for his Poems on Various Occasions, which was more than seven years of salary for his government job). That would be the only money an author would see from the book, and therefore he or she would need to produce a new version, new book, or a serial publication of the next work to have hopes of more income. Prior to 1737, novelists had come from the ranks of satirists (Jonathan Swift) and journalists (Daniel Defoe), but these novels had in common wide changes of scenery, long plots, and often impossible things (such as talking horses)‚Äîall features that made the works unsuitable for the stage. The exception was Aphra Behn, who was a dramatist first and a novelist second. Her Oroonoko seems to have been written as a novel simply because there was no time for staging, as it was a political commentary on ongoing events, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have another play on the boards at the time. Her Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister, like Gulliver's Travels and Moll Flanders, was inappropriate for the stage. [...] However, after 1737, novels began to have dramatic structures involving only normal human beings, as the stage was closed off for serious authors.|$|E
