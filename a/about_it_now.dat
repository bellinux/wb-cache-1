500|$|... one {{of things}} that strikes me most about the Thirties scene when I think <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>now</b> is the trilby hat, the {{universal}} headgear of the middle classes... ometime early in the century, {{it must have been}} a wild gesture of freedom and informality... By the thirties it had certainly become degenerate... It was a hat which had lost all aspiration: it had become a mingy hat...".|$|E
500|$|From 1995 he {{also spent}} three years at Talk Radio UK, {{presenting}} Starkey on Saturday, later Starkey on Sunday. [...] An interview with Denis Healey proved {{to be one of}} his most embarrassing moments: [...] "I mistakenly thought that he had become an amiable old buffer who would engage in amusing conversation, and he tore me limb from limb. I laugh <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>now,</b> but I didn't feel like laughing about it at the time." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{his early}} {{schooling}} life, {{he was interested}} in art, and has detailed that he would draw popular video game characters such as Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog. During high school, he would skip classes to play video games at an Internet cafe with friends; on this topic, PewDiePie has commented, [...] "Sweden has a great culture around gaming." [...] In 2008, he graduated from Göteborgs Högre Samskola. He then went on to pursue a degree in industrial economics and technology management at Chalmers University of Technology, but left the university in 2011. On his decision, PewDiePie has stated, [...] "Thinking <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>now,</b> it was utterly absurd. To get into Chalmers for industrial economics you need straight A's, but somehow I was happier selling hot dogs and making my own gaming-videos." [...] While his reason for leaving Chalmers has often been reported as a want to focus on his YouTube career, in 2017, PewDiePie clarified, [...] "Why does everyone get this story wrong? [...] I dropped out of university because I didn't like it. To drop out of university to pursue YouTube, that'd just be fucking stupid." [...] He added that [...] "industrial management and economics [...] boring as hell [...] I couldn't relate to fucking anyone." ...|$|E
500|$|Jacob Acaye, {{the former}} child soldier {{featured}} in the film, supported the video and defended its makers. In response to Ugandans saying that the film was out-of-date, Jacob stated that, [...] "It is not too late, because all this fighting and suffering {{is still going on}} elsewhere. Until now, the war that was going on has been a silent war. People did not really know <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Now</b> what was happening in Gulu is still going on elsewhere in the Central African Republic and in Congo. What about the people who are suffering over there? They are going through what we were going through." [...] It was noted by Los Angeles Times journalists Lindsay Branham and Jocelyn Kelly that a number of people living in the areas where the LRA is currently active have previously called for attention and advocacy to be directed at the issue. Julien Marneffe, a worker for Catholic Relief Services in Goma said [...] "it's been an undeniable success -- and one all humanitarian organizations working in this area can be happy about," [...] but added to [...] "be careful not to oversimplify the issue" [...] and worried that the interest might be short lived when [...] "another crisis or another video will be the next online trend, and I fear that most people will forget about the problems of the LRA." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the album}} Untouchables leaking onto the Internet, Take a Look in the Mirror was {{released}} on a Friday, November 21, 2003 – four days earlier than its original release date. The album therefore received a weekend's worth of sales, {{which resulted in a}} poor showing on the Billboard 200.

It is the first album self-produced by Korn. The band explained that they wanted fans to hear the music as it should be. The album presented different styles and themes compared to previous albums. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis related: [...] "The whole album is about love, hate and my hate of people and just losing my mind. The previous albums I did, I think the last three, I was coming from a place of hurt. And I just finally {{got to the point where}} I'm done hurting and I'm just pissed off <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>now.</b> It's turned back to just sheer hate and anger. And it definitely comes across on the album." [...] MTV News said that Davis convinced his fans that they [...] "will be shocked, particularly with the album's second track, 'Break Some Off,' which he called 'brutal'." [...] Korn released the single [...] "Did My Time" [...] on July 22, 2003, which was used to promote the film but did not appear on the soundtrack to [...] due to unspecified legal issues. The single debuted and peaked at number thirty-eight on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Korn's first and only top-forty hit in the United States. [...] "Did My Time" [...] gave Korn another Grammy nomination in the Best Metal Performance category.|$|E

2500|$|In April {{that year}} they had signed to Murmur, a {{subsidiary}} label of Sony Music, {{on the basis}} of their live performances. They followed with a national tour alongside Snout, and Automatic. In 2004 Daymon recalled [...] "our very first EP came out through Murmur. Right from the very start we never really self-financed any of our early material ... Thinking <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>now,</b> over the years, a lot of being in a band – for us – is touring and playing the shows; that's always done independently anyway".

It appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart in the top100.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the seventh}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Laban {{answered}} Jacob {{that they were}} his daughters, his children, and his flocks, but asked {{what he could do}} <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>now.</b> Instead, Laban proposed that they make a covenant, and Jacob set up a stone pillar and with his kin heaped stones, and they ate a meal by the heap. Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. Laban called the heap as a witness between him and Jacob, and invoked God to watch, when they were apart, if Jacob would afflict Laban's daughters and take other wives. And Laban designated the heap and the pillar as a boundary between him and Jacob; Laban would not pass over it to Jacob, and Jacob would not pass over it to Laban, to do harm. Laban invoked the God of Abraham, the God of Nahor, and the God of Terah, and Jacob swore by the Fear of Isaac and offered a sacrifice.|$|E

I can talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>now</b> at 65 because it's sort of, dispassionate about it, and I've seen worse things since, but that gave me a bit of a turn, yes, I didn't enjoy that.

2500|$|In December 2003, EastEnders made {{headlines}} in the UK press after they screened a kiss between Kelly and Zoe. The storyline was featured in a New Year's Eve episode that was filmed on-location in Scotland. In the storyline, a group of teenagers travel from London to Scotland for New Year's Eve, but their minibus crashes, leaving them stranded and injured on the freezing cold Scottish moors. While stranded, Kelly cares for an injured Zoe, they become over-emotional, and kiss. Kinsella explained the reasons behind the kiss: [...] "They're stuck in the hills, thinking they're going to die—it's {{a way of saying}} goodbye and also of showing how much they love each other as friends. Which is quite sweet really." [...] She claimed that the kiss was made easier {{due to the fact that}} she was kissing her off-screen best friend: [...] "That made it so much easier. We thought we were just going to be laughing and giggling the whole way through, but we were very professional. It was so cold that we just wanted to get it over with. We were shaking from cold—not from nerves—and it was raining, so we just thought, 'Let's do it and get it done with'. [...] We laugh <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>now.</b> When it came down to it, the truth was that it was just like any other screen kiss." [...] The episode featuring their kiss attracted [...] 9.5million viewers, and the precise moment that they kissed was watched by 44% of the available viewing audience.|$|E
