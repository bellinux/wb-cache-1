500|$|An <b>aphtha</b> (plural aphthae) is a non {{specific}} term {{that refers to}} an ulcer of the mouth. The word {{is derived from the}} Greek word <b>aphtha</b> meaning [...] "eruption" [...] or [...] "ulcer". The lesions of several other oral conditions are sometimes described as aphthae, including Bednar's aphthae (infected, traumatic ulcers on the hard palate in infants), oral candidiasis, and foot-and-mouth disease. When used without qualification, aphthae commonly refers to lesions of recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Since the word <b>aphtha</b> is often taken to be synonymous with ulcer, {{it has been suggested that}} the term [...] "aphthous ulcer" [...] is redundant, but it remains in common use. Stomatitis is also a non-specific term referring to any inflammatory process in the mouth, with or without oral ulceration. It may describe many different conditions apart from aphthous stomatitis such as angular stomatitis.|$|E

The pretense they made for this strange attempt was an ancient practice, while they said that of old it was determined by lot; but in truth, it was no better than a dissolution of an undeniable law, and a cunning contrivance to seize upon the government, derived from those that presumed to appoint governors as they themselves pleased. Hereupon they sent for one of the pontifical tribes, which is called Eniachin, and cast lots which of it should be the high priest. By fortune the lot so fell as to demonstrate their iniquity after the plainest manner, for it fell upon one whose name was Phannias, the son of Samuel, of the village <b>Aphtha.</b> He was a man not only unworthy of the high priesthood, but that did not well know what the high priesthood was, such a mere rustic was he! Yet did they hail this man, without his own consent, out of the country, as if they were acting a play upon the stage, and adorned him with a counterfeit thee; they also put upon him the sacred garments, and upon every occasion instructed him what he was to do. This horrid piece of wickedness was sport and pastime with them, but occasioned the other priests, who at a distance saw their law made a jest of, to shed tears, and sorely lament the dissolution of such a sacred dignity.|$|E

MethodsIn {{the present study}} adult patients from the Vedado's University Polyclinic (Cuba) diagnosed with RAS, from September 2009 to May 2010, were examined. Clinical classification, site, associated predisposing factors and clinical evolution of <b>aphthae</b> were evaluated. All patients were reevaluated at 10 and 14 days after the diagnosis to analyze the healing process. ResultsMinor <b>aphthae</b> was the more frequent clinical variant of RAS (88. 4 %) followed by Major (8. 4 %) and Herpetiform (3. 2 %) <b>aphthae.</b> Females were more affected (67. 4 %) than males (22, 6 %). Major <b>aphthae</b> was more common in patients aged between 35 and 59 years old, however Minor and Herpetiform <b>aphthae</b> were more common in individuals aged between 19 and 34 years old.

40|$|SUMMARY Fifty {{patients}} presenting sequentially with {{a history}} of recurrent <b>aphthae</b> were investi-gated for evidence of nutritional deficiencies and coeliac disease. In the group, two patients were found to have coeliac disease and their recurrent <b>aphthae</b> cleared soon after starting a gluten free diet. This study confirms the presence of an increased prevalence of nutritional deficiency and of coeliac disease in aphthous patients. However, it is recommended that jejunal biopsy be carried out in these cases only where there is evidence of malabsorption. Recurrent <b>aphthae</b> is a disorder which may have a multifactorial aetiology. Although various forms of <b>aphthae</b> have been described in relation to their size, distribution on the oral mucosa and duration of ulceration, these clinical criteria have not been useful in determining the aetiological factors.

40|$|Background and aims. Recurrent aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{a condition}} comprised of oral painful ulcers appearing at intervals in different intraoral sites, triggered {{by a variety of}} causative agents in certain subgroups of patients. Since there are no studies on the subject in Northwest Iran, the aims of the present study were to evaluate the prevalence of aphthous ulcer and to assess the association of some influencing factors on minor <b>aphtha.</b> &# 13; Materials and methods. Of all patients examined during a two-year period, 33 patients were diagnosed with aphthous lesions. A questionnaire was used to collect the data including age, gender, familial history, smoking habit, and food allergy of the patients. Chi-square test was used to assess the association of variables. &# 13; Results. The prevalence of aphthous lesions was found to be 0. 3 %, and was significantly higher in females compared with males (23 females and 10 males, respectively; P = 0. 024). Familial involvement of aphthous ulcer was reported in 42. 4 % of the patients (P = 0. 411). The aphthous ulcer was seen less frequently in smokers compared with non-smokers (P = 0. 024). &# 13; Conclusion. A relatively low prevalence of minor <b>aphtha</b> was found in the studied population. Higher prevalence in females and non-smokers were observed...|$|E

40|$|Behcet’s disease (BD) is {{characterized}} by recurrent attacks of uveitis, oral <b>aphtha,</b> genital ulcers and skin lesions. The etiology and pathogenesis of BD are largely unknown. It {{has been reported that}} excessive Th 1 cell function is involved in the pathogenesis of BD. Previously, we found that Txk, a member of the Tec family of tyrosine kinases, acts as a Th 1 cell-specific transcription factor that is involved in the effector function of Th 1 cells. Thus, we studied Th 1 cytokine production and Txk expression of T-lymphocytes in patients with BD. Peripheral blood lymphocytes produced excessive Th 1 -associated cytokines including interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin (IL) - 12 in patients with BD. Circulating CD 3 + and purified CD 4 + T cells expressed excessive Txk protein. The extent of IFN-γ production by the lymphocytes correlated with the expression of Txk protein in the immunoblotting analysis. The majority of cells infiltrating into the skin lesions of patients with BD expressed IFN-γ. IL- 12 and IL- 18 were found in the mononuclear cell aggregates in the skin and intestinal lesions of those with BD. Lymphocytes accumulating in the skin and intestinal lesions expressed higher levels of Txk as compared with other Th 2 -associated diseases. IFN-γ, IL- 18 and IL- 12 detected in skin lesions may induce preferential development of Th 1 cells in patients with BD. Collectively, Th 1 cells expressing Txk and Th 1 -associated cytokines may {{play a critical role in}} the development of skin and intestinal lesions in patients with BD. This review may serve as a reminder of the importance of excessive Th 1 cell function in the pathogenesis of BD and may contribute to the discovery of new molecular targets for the development of a specific therapeutic strategy for BD...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper an autopsy case report of Neuro-Behçet's {{syndrome}} has been made and patho-histological studies of the brain of the 8 autopsy cases reported previously {{as well as those}} of the present case have been conducted. The present case was a 47 -years old man. In the ninth years after the onset of symptoms in the oral cavity and in the genitalia he was troubled repeatedly with diplopia. Gradually there appeared such symptoms as the disturbance of his gait, forced laughing, disturbance of speech, ataxia, and the inflammation at the sites of injection. He had remission and aggravation of these symptoms. However, he died of respiratory paralysis 17 years after the onset of oral <b>aphtha</b> and 8 years after the onset of diplopia. In the patho-histological observation of this case there were seen perivascular cell infiltration covering the entire cerebral parenchyma as well as a portion of meninges, revealing a picture of chronic disseminated panmeningoencephalitis and cerebral abscess of medulla oblongata. In addition, there were fibrinoid degeneration of the blood vessel wall and such degenerative changes in the blood vessels as fibrosis and proliferation of collagen fibers; and also circumscribed foci of glia cell proliferation, softening cavities and abnomal proliferation of consumptive pigments. These pathlogical changes were recognized in the entire brain, but they were especially prominent in brain-stem. There were no pathologica changes in the optic nerves and in the spinal cord. In the investigations of the patho-histological picture of the brain in our case as well as in the cases reported in literature, the common findings in Neuro-Behçet's syndrome are extensive disseminated perivascular cell infiltration of the brain, softning accompanied by a moderate proliferation of microglia cells and degenerative changes of the blood vessel wall. while these pathological changes are especially marked in the brain-stem, to a greater degree in the white matter than in the grey matter. Neuro-Behçet's syndrome has been found to resemble periarteritis nodosa and clinically it shows many common pathologic changes as found in collagene disease. Hence, it is assumed that Behçet's syndrome belongs to the collagene disease...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Bednar <b>aphthae</b> are {{infected}} wounds caused by trauma, localized {{to the hard}} palate in infants. They do not require specific treatment because they regress spontaneously in a few days. They often remain undiagnosed; other times, because of the pain they caused, they may worsen the nursing. CASE REPORT: We describe the clinical case of a healthy infant of 2 months, fed with formula, who has 2 aphthous lesions in the oral cavity associated with irritability and inconsolable crying during feeding. We excluded the influence of infectious factors or underlying diseases. The hypothesis of a traumatic factor {{was supported by the}} anatomical features of <b>aphthae</b> and then confirmed by the gradual resolution of lesions after some advices on breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: Our intent is to provide a photographic record of Bednar <b>aphthae,</b> which are quite common but often misdiagnosed also because of lacking of photographic material. Improved knowledge of this condition helps physicians in the differential diagnosis of a traumatic condition that is not as unusual as it seems in newborns...|$|R
