5|$|The entire metro {{system and}} the trains are run by a fully {{automated}} computer system, located at the Control and Maintenance Center south of Vestamager Station. The <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> control (ATC) consists of three subsystems: <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> protection (ATP), <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> operation (ATO) and <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> supervisory (ATS). The ATP is responsible for keeping the trains' speed, ensuring that doors are closed before departure and switches are correctly set. The system uses fixed block signaling, except around stations, where moving block signaling is used.|$|E
5|$|During normal {{passenger}} {{operation on}} revenue tracks, trains {{are designed to}} be controlled by an integrated <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> Operation (ATO) and <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> Control (ATC) system that accelerates and brakes trains automatically without operator intervention. All trains are still manned with train operators who open and close the doors, make station announcements, and supervise their trains. The system was designed so that an operator could manually operate a train when necessary.|$|E
5|$|According {{to transit}} {{advocate}} Steve Munro, the SSE {{will be built}} to use only <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> control. This would preclude the operation of T1 subway cars on the extension {{as it would be}} too expensive to convert T1 cars to ATC.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Proper {{design of}} {{experiments}} for <b>automatic</b> <b>training</b> phase for application performance prediction is important for accuracy, and robustness of the predictions. Diversity, sizes of different factors affecting the application performance, and the dynamic nature of the Grid aggravate {{the complexity of the}} <b>automatic</b> <b>training</b> phase in the environment. To remedy this we present a novel {{design of experiments}}. Our approach is supported by two intra- and inter-platform performance sharing and translation mechanisms. Experiments from prototype implementation are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. ...|$|R
5|$|In 2000 and 2001, Flytoget {{experienced}} three derailments {{with empty}} trains at Gardermoen; one {{caused by the}} engineer falling asleep and two by the train passing a red light. No more such accidents occurred after <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> Control was installed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The system {{currently}} uses Automatic Block Signaling with fixed wayside {{signals and}} <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> stops {{in order to}} provide safe train operation across the whole system. The New York City Subway system has, for the most part, used block signalling since its 1904 opening, and many portions of the signaling system were installed between the 1930s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|At present, all Singapore lines {{run with}} fixed length trains {{between three and}} six cars, with the future Thomson-East Coast Line using four cars. Since the system's {{conception}} in 1987, all train lines have been powered by the 750 volt DC third rail, {{with the exception of}} the North East Line which is powered by 1500 volt DC overhead lines.

5|$|In 1954, the Oslo City Council {{decided to}} build a four-line metro to the new suburbs {{to the east of}} the city center. The plans would lead to the system opening in 1966, after the {{conversion}} of the Østensjø and the Lambertseter Line of the Oslo Tramway to metro standard, and supplemented with the new Furuset and Grorud Line. The system would feature higher and longer platforms, allowing step-free access to six-car trains, <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> protection and third rail power supply. This would make the metro incompatible with the existing tramways.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2007, the Staten Island Railway used Baltimore & Ohio Railroad style color {{position}} light signals that dated {{back to when}} it was a B line. In 2007, a $72 million project to replace the old signal system was completed. The system was replaced with an FRA-compliant 100Hz, track circuit based, <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> Control (ATC) signal system. As part of the project, forty R44 subway cars and four locomotives were modified with on board cab signaling equipment for ATC bi-directional movement. A new rail control center and back-up control center was constructed as part of this contract.|$|E
5|$|The AirTrain JFK {{portion of}} this station has two tracks and one island {{platform}} on the upper level of the station complex. The eastern end of the AirTrain platform leads to Parking Area C. Unlike the New York City Subway platforms, the AirTrain JFK platforms are entirely enclosed and feature platform screen doors, which help the station maintain a constant temperature and prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. An array of sensors detect a train's position on the track, and only when it is properly aligned will the train's doors open. This enables the AirTrain to use <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> operation without drivers.|$|E

40|$|Most page {{segmentation}} algorithms have userspecifiable free parameters. However, algorithm designers {{typically do}} not provide a quantitative/rigorous method for choosing values for these parameters. The free parameter values can affect the segmentation result quite drastically and are very dependent on the particular dataset that the algorithm is being used on. In this paper, we present an <b>automatic</b> <b>training</b> method for choosing free parameters of page segmentation algorithms. The <b>automatic</b> <b>training</b> problem is posed as a multivariate non-smooth function optimization problem. An efficient direct search method [...] - simplex method [...] - is used to solve this optimization problem. This training method is then applied to the training of Kise's page segmentation algorithm. It is found that a set of optimal parameter values and their corresponding performance index can be found using relatively few function evaluations.

5|$|Together {{with the}} {{introduction}} of S Stock trains, the track, electrical supply and signalling systems are being upgraded in a programme planned to increase peak-hour capacity on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines by 65 per cent by the end of 2018. A single control room for the sub-surface railway is to be established in Hammersmith and an <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> control (ATC) system will replace signalling equipment installed from the 1940s. The cross-London Crossrail line, planned to open in 2018, is expected to reduce crowding between Paddington and Whitechapel.|$|E
5|$|Two tender {{locomotives}} {{were used}} to demonstrate the Angus <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> control equipment; they had originally been West Midland Railway 2-4-0s numbers 103 and 104. They were on the WSMR from 17 December 1911 and used for a demonstration on 5 July 1912. On 4 November 1917 they were moved to Taunton, where they were stored until 1919. After being sold to the Bute Works Supply Company in 1920 they were sold on to the Cambrian Railways in 1921 as their numbers 10 and 1. They were absorbed into the Great Western Railway as 1328 and 1329.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, {{the city}} decided {{to connect the}} four {{suburban}} lines west of the city center with the Oslo Metro. The Sognsvann Line {{was selected as the}} first line to be upgraded, so the two systems would become compatible. The line was upgraded to metro standard by replacing the overhead wire with a third-rail power supply and installing <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> protection. All the stations were rebuilt, with platforms lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains, and the platform height increased. The third rail required all level crossings to be removed, resulting in the line being rebuilt several places to allow the road to underpass or overpass. The light rail permitted passengers to cross the lines at the stations, but this was made impossible with metro standard. Because of this, underpasses or overpasses were built at the stations.|$|E

40|$|A rat cyborg system {{refers to}} a {{biological}} rat implanted with microelectrodes in its brain, via which the outer electrical stimuli can be delivered into the brain in vivo to control its behaviors. Rat cyborgs have various applications in emergency, such as search and rescue in disasters. Prior to a rat cyborg becoming controllable, {{a lot of effort}} is required to train it to adapt to the electrical stimuli. In this paper, we build a vision-based <b>automatic</b> <b>training</b> system for rat cyborgs to replace the time-consuming manual training procedure. A hierarchical framework is proposed to facilitate the colearning between rats and machines. In the framework, the behavioral states of a rat cyborg are visually sensed by a camera, a parameterized state machine is employed to model the training action transitions triggered by rat’s behavioral states, and an adaptive adjustment policy is developed to adaptively adjust the stimulation intensity. The experimental results of three rat cyborgs prove the effectiveness of our system. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to tackle <b>automatic</b> <b>training</b> of animal cyborgs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{framework}} {{of this paper}} is the robotics nav-igation inside buildings using WiFi signal strength measure. This navigation is achieved using a Partially Observable Markov Decission Process (POMDP). In the localization phase we used WiFi signal strength and Ultrasound measures as observations. The localization system works in two stages: map construction and localization stage. The map construction stage usually requires a great effort, therefore in this paper we address the problem of minimizing this calibration effort using an <b>automatic</b> <b>training</b> method. We describe the method based on Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) techniques and in a robust local navigation task. This automatic method is compared with a manual method to obtain a deterministic map. Also we demonstrate that using this one in a on-line training stage the system is able to adapt the WiFi map to the variations of the WiFi signal measure. Additionally, we analyze the optimal parameters for this <b>automatic</b> <b>training</b> system. The system has been tested in a real environment using two commercial robotic platforms. Some experimental results and the conclusions are presented. I...|$|R

5|$|The NTSB {{found that}} Train 214 {{had come to}} a stop entirely within the faulty circuit B2-304, making it {{effectively}} invisible to the <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> control system. Other trains had received speed commands of 0 when traveling through this circuit but had enough forward momentum {{to make it to the}} next circuit and resume detection and receipt of speed commands from the ATC system. Train 214 was going slower than normal because it was being driven in manual mode by its operator, and it came to a stop while remaining on circuit B2-304 and was therefore invisible. Train 112 behind it was given full speed commands by the ATC to proceed on the track. The investigation found that the emergency brakes had been applied by the operator of train 112 when train 214 came into view but it was too late to avert the collision.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} found {{that after a}} June 17 replacement of a track circuit component at what became {{the site of the}} June 22 collision, the track circuit had been suffering from parasitic oscillations which left it unable to reliably report when that stretch of track was occupied by a train. The struck train came to a stop because of traffic ahead. Because the entire train was within the faulty circuit, it became invisible to the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> Control (ATC) system. The train behind it was therefore commanded to proceed at 55mph. The operator of the striking train applied the emergency brake after the stopped train came into full view but there was not enough time to prevent the collision, which occurred at approximately 44mph.|$|E
5|$|The first idea {{to launch}} a citywide rapid transit was {{launched}} in 1912 {{with the construction of}} the Ekeberg Line; constructed with the same width profile as the Holmenkollen Line, the plan was to build a tunnel under the city center and run through trains, but large cost expenditures on the first section of the Common Tunnel ceased the plans. As part of the rebuilding after World War II a planning office for a T-bane was established in 1949, with the first plans launched in 1951; in 1954, the city council decided to build the T-bane network in Eastern Oslo with four branches.
