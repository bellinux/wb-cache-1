25|$|The Delaware River {{is used by}} American shad {{during their}} {{spawning}} run. The fish are the largest members of the herring family. They are an <b>anadromous</b> <b>species,</b> which means they are born and spawn in fresh water but spend {{the majority of their}} lives in salt water (of the Atlantic Ocean). After spending three to six years at sea, the shad return to the waters of their birth to spawn. Unlike salmon, not all shad die after spawning; some survive and return to the ocean.|$|E
25|$|The North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) was {{established}} by the Convention for the Conservation of Anadromous Stocks in the North Pacific Ocean. On 11 February 1992, the Convention was signed by Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, and the United States of America, and took effect on 16 February 1993. The Republic of Korea later acceded to the Convention on 27 May 2003. As indicated in the Convention, the main objective of the NPAFC is to promote the conservation of anadromous stocks in the North Pacific Ocean. The NPAFC provides a framework for international cooperation on the scientific research of <b>anadromous</b> <b>species</b> and enforcement of fisheries regulations in the Convention Area. The Convention prohibits directed catch of anadromous fish in the Convention Area, but allows for some fishing of these species for scientific purposes under national and joint research programs with prior approval of the NPAFC. The Convention also includes measures to reduce incidental catch of anadromous fish in other high seas fisheries and prohibits the retention of these species on board fishing vessels in the Convention Area.|$|E

2500|$|Lotic systems {{typically}} {{connect to}} each other, forming {{a path to}} the ocean (spring → stream → river → ocean), and many fishes have life cycles that require stages in both fresh and salt water. [...] Salmon, for example, are <b>anadromous</b> <b>species</b> that are born in freshwater but {{spend most of their}} adult life in the ocean, returning to fresh water only to spawn. Eels are catadromous species that do the opposite, living in freshwater as adults but migrating to the ocean to spawn.|$|E
2500|$|Fish {{populations are}} {{hindered}} by two storm water detention systems: the M-1 Dam (or [...] "Boeing Creek Detention Facility"), an in-stream retention device {{on the main}} fork, and the Retention-Detention Ponds, an off-channel system in Boeing Creek Park. Three other structures influence stream ecology: Hidden Lake and its associated dam; an artificial waterfall, about ten feet high, constructed from concrete, just downstream from Innis Arden Way; and the [...] "Seattle Country Club Golf Course Dam", a metal dam and pump station about 200 meters downstream of Innis Arden Way, which forms of reservoir that supplies the Seattle Country Club golf course with irrigation water. None of the dams provide fish passage and therefore present a total barrier, limiting stream use by <b>anadromous</b> <b>species</b> to the lower third of the creek.|$|E

5000|$|Occithrissops {{skulls and}} spines shared {{similarities}} to modern day osteoglossiformes. It had a thick skull and cleft pectoral fins, a body shape built towards fast pursuit in marine environments {{as opposed to}} the living osteoglossiforms which have elongated fins more suited to maneuvering in heavily obstructed rivers. They were a <b>anadromous</b> <b>species,</b> a term which comes from the Greek anadromos, meaning [...] "running upward". They would migrate into fresh-water to spawn, albeit not as successfully as other <b>anadromous</b> <b>species,</b> as Occithrissops and other open-ocean osteoglossiformes did not survive the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event, while other members retreated to Gondwana rivers before the continent broke up.|$|E
50|$|The {{blueback herring}} or blueback shad (Alosa aestivalis) is an <b>anadromous</b> <b>species</b> of herring {{from the east}} coast of North America, with a range from Nova Scotia to Florida.

50|$|It {{is a major}} {{component}} of the American River Watershed. During the summer months, water is released to prevent Salt Water Intrusion in the San Joaquin Delta. These water releases maintain water quality and keep ideal water temperatures for <b>anadromous</b> fish <b>species</b> such as Chinook-Salmon, Steelhead and American Shad. Several of these species are of primary concern due to their decline in numbers and spawning habitat destruction.|$|R
50|$|Some dams in the Pacific Northwest and California block {{passage for}} <b>anadromous</b> fish <b>species</b> such as Pacific Salmon and steelhead.

50|$|Hickory shad (Alosa mediocris) is {{a member}} of the herring family Clupeidae, ranging along the East Coast of the United States from Florida to the Gulf of Maine. It is an <b>anadromous</b> fish <b>species,</b> meaning that it spawns in {{freshwater}} portions of rivers but spends most of its life at sea. It is subject to fishing, both historic and current, but it is often confused with or simply grouped together with catch statistics for American shad (Alosa sapidissima).|$|R
50|$|In September 2007, the DFG again {{attempted}} to eradicate northern pike {{by lowering the}} water level and treating the remaining water with rotenone. DFG feared that pike might escape the lake and enter the Sacramento River system, potentially harming native <b>anadromous</b> fish <b>species</b> such as steelhead and salmon. The effort was controversial because pike are popular gamefish and considerable effort had already been spent on unsuccessful attempts to rid the lake of pike using explosives, nets, shocking, and poison.|$|R
50|$|Two {{hundred and}} five species of {{vertebrates}} {{have been identified}} within the Bully Creek watershed. Large mammals such as Rocky Mountain elk and mule deer, bobcats, beavers, otters, and raccoons inhabit the region. Twenty one species of fish have been spotted, {{but there are no}} <b>anadromous</b> <b>species.</b> The threatened bald eagle lives in the watershed during the winter.|$|E
50|$|The adult Arctic lamprey spawns in {{the gravel}} of riffles. The ammocoetes, as the lamprey larvae are known, are found in muddy {{freshwater}} habitats where they burrow {{in the mud and}} feed on detritus. It is generally an <b>anadromous</b> <b>species,</b> living in the ocean before migrating to fresh water to spawn, but some populations are permanent residents of fresh water.|$|E
50|$|Hickory shad {{ranges from}} {{northern}} Florida to the Gulf of Maine. The largest populations occur in Chesapeake Bay and coastal North Carolina (Munroe 2002). It is a schooling <b>anadromous</b> <b>species</b> that inhabits marine waters, probably {{never far from}} land. Adults enter estuaries and freshwater tributaries from the St. John's River, Florida, to the Patuxent River, Maryland,to spawn during the spring. Their oceanic movements are poorly documented (Hardy 1978; Cooper 1983; Rulifson 1994).|$|E
50|$|Nominally a {{tributary}} of the Sacramento River, Cache Creek now only reaches it during extremely wet years due to damming and diversion of the stream's water. Degradation of the channel caused by invasive plants, such as Arundo donax and Tamarix spp., as well as gravel mining has left no suitable habitat for Chinook salmon and steelhead to spawn, even if there is enough water. Consequently, there are no longer any <b>anadromous</b> fish <b>species</b> in Cache Creek.|$|R
