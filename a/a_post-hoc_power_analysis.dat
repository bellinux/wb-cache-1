40|$|Abstract Background A {{recent study}} from our {{laboratory}} has demonstrated improved {{range of motion}} in the toes of broiler chickens afflicted with pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis when treated with local antibiotic and corticosteroid injections, without surgical drainage. However, the use of corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment raised peer concern, as steroids {{are thought to have}} deleterious effects on tendon strength. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the tensile strength of the aforementioned steroid treated tendons, to a group of tendons administered with the current standard treatment: systemic antibiotics, surgical drainage and no corticosteroids. Methods Twenty-three tendons’ structural and material properties were investigated (fifteen receiving the standard treatment, eight receiving the steroid treatment).

40|$|Among the {{questions}} that a researcher should ask when planning a study is "How large a sample do I need?" If the sample size is too small, even a well conducted study may fail to answer its research question, may fail to detect important effects or associations, or may estimate those effects or associations too imprecisely. Similarly, if the sample size is too large, the study {{will be more difficult}} and costly, and may even lead to a loss in accuracy. Hence, optimum sample size is an essential component of any research. When the estimated sample size can not be included in <b>a</b> study, <b>post-hoc</b> <b>power</b> <b>analysis</b> should be carried out. Approaches for estimating sample size and performing <b>power</b> <b>analysis</b> depend primarily on the study design and the main outcome measure of the study. There are distinct approaches for calculating sample size for different study designs and different outcome measures.

The hypothesis of the study was that ACP can enhance healing response of injured cartilage. A full-thickness chondral lesion on the weight-bearing area of the medial femoral condyle was performed in 30 sheep. Animals were divided into 2 groups, according to postoperative treatment: in group 1, weekly injections of ACP for five times were performed; in group 2, lesions were left untreated. Animals were sacrificed at 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment. A histological evaluation was performed according to a modified O'Driscoll histological score.

40|$|This body of {{research}} was conducted {{to gain a better}} understanding of the antemortem factors affecting beef off-flavors with particular interest in the liver-like off flavor. The first study examined the effects of varying (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 %) levels of wet distillers grains plus solubles (WDGS) on flavor of beef aged 7 d. No significant treatment effects were reported (P ≥ 0. 07), but USDA Choice steaks had more panelists indicate the presence of metallic off-flavor. The second study tested a selection procedure as a means to obtain more liver-like off flavored samples. Although the two panelists had moderate agreement as indicated by a kappa statistic, <b>a</b> <b>post-hoc</b> <b>power</b> <b>analysis</b> revealed that there were not two distinct flavor populations. Therefore, the efficacy of the selection procedure would needs further testing. Samples generated from the selection procedure were tested by a trained sensory panel and regression equations were derived to predict the incidence of liver-like off flavor. Unsaturated fatty acids and sodium significantly explained 46 % of the variation in the incidence of liver-like off flavor. The final phase of this research evaluated chemical and sensory attributes of source-verified cattle finished on 30 % WDGS enriched with varying levels of alfalfa hay, corn silage, or corn stalks based on NDF. Significant (P ≤ 0. 050) treatment effects were observed for intramuscular amounts of 16 : 0, 18 : 1 (n- 9), 18 : 2 (n- 6), 20 : 4 (n- 6), 22 : 5 (n- 3), MUFA, PUFA, and omega 6 fatty acids. No significant (P ≥ 0. 670) treatment or location effects were noted for liver-like off flavor, so correlation coefficients were derived to explain the relation between the liver-like off flavor and chemical properties. Subcutaneous amounts of 18 : 2 (n- 6 t) (r = − 0. 17) were inversely related the incidence of liver-like off flavor, while 20 : 1 (n- 9) (r = 0. 21), CLA 9 c, 11 t (r = 0. 16) were directly related. Results from this research indicate that unsaturated fatty acids and sodium explain some of the variation in liver-like off flavor.

The {{aim of this}} pilot {{study was to determine}} if there was a relationship between disease severity, measured by right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), and gas exchange, measured by oxygen consumption, during the six-minute walk test (6 MWT) in ten patients with idiopathic PAH. In addition, we sought to determine if there was a relationship between the change in RVSP and the change in gas exchange following several months of therapy with the goal of reducing RVSP. The optimal treatment (medication) was determined by the subjects' doctors and was not recorded for this study. For test 1, we found a negative non-significant relationship between end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO 2) and RVSP (r=- 0. 6, p= 0. 094) and a negative non-significant correlation between PETCO 2 and RVSP (r=- 0. 7, p= 0. 13) for test 2. We also found a positive, non-significant correlation between minute ventilation (VE) relative to carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO 2) assessed at the mouth and RVSP (r= 0. 6, p= 0. 06) for test 1 and a positive non-significant correlation between VE/VCO 2 and RVSP (r= 0. 5, p= 0. 33) for test 2. We found a significant drop in RVSP (p= 0. 049), PETCO 2 (p= 0. 023) and VE/VCO 2 (p= 0. 025) between test 1 and test 2. We found no relationship between the change in RVSP and the change in PETCO 2; we found a moderate, non-significant, relationship between change in RVSP and change in VE/VCO 2 (r= 0. 7, p= 0. 09). Due to the small sample size there was no significant relationship between the change in RVSP and the change in VE/VCO 2; however, the trend towards significance suggests that the assessment of the gas exchange parameter VE/VCO 2 may be sensitive enough to determine changes in disease severity in patients with pulmonary hypertension in a study with a larger sample size.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Levee {{vegetation}} {{management has}} been a challenge in King County due to conflicting federal mandates. Since the early 1990 s King County has been incorporating bioengineering techniques into levee repairs. These techniques entailed the use of vegetation to not only provide bank stability but to also improve conditions for salmon as required under the Endangered Species Act. However, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers required the removal of any vegetation over two inches in diameter to remain eligible for federal emergency funding under Public Law 84 - 99, hypothesizing that it compromised levee stability as well as hindered inspections. While {{there have been many}} studies on vegetation's effect on stability in natural systems, less information is available on the effect of vegetation on the structural stability of levees and revetments This research investigates the effect of vegetation on levee structural integrity on the Green River in King County, Washington State. Initially, the investigation set out to compare levees repaired using bioengineering techniques with levees repaired using traditional rock. However, no digital information was available on bioengineered levee projects on the Green River {{that could be used to}} develop a study plan. The first project task involved organizing files and documenting the institutional knowledge at King County on the levee projects along the Green River. Fifty-four bioengineered repairs on the Green River were visited and geo-referenced. Based on information gleaned from the data mining and mapping exercises, it became clear that comparisons of stability of bioengineered versus non-bioengineered levees could not be made. As such, a retrospective pilot study was undertaken to directly address the issue of the role of vegetation in levee stability. Using a case control method, 12 documented levee sites that incurred damage during November 2006 flooding were matched with undamaged sites on a one to one basis. Basic land cover type (trees, shrubs, grass, bare ground, impervious surfaces) was delineated through aerial photography taken prior to the flooding and percent cover of each type was calculated from these measurements. Study results reveal the paired differences between percent cover of trees, impervious surfaces, and bare ground were not statistically significantly different between damaged and control sites. However, of the paired sites where trees were present on both the case (damaged site) and the control, the control generally had more tree cover than the case. Shrub cover was statistically higher on damaged sites than on control sites. but it was not possible to determine if shrub cover was native or non-native. <b>Post-hoc</b> <b>power</b> <b>analysis</b> indicates that <b>a</b> much larger sample size of at least 54 matched cases and controls would be needed to determine a more scientifically defensible and statistically robust result for the effect of tree cover on levee damage. The steps taken for the pilot study could be duplicated in any larger study. However, it is unlikely that all damages could be satisfactorily matched with bioengineered sites on the Green River given the number of variables to be considered when matching. The results from this study show the complexity of trying to isolate a single factor contributing to levee stability...|$|R

The GH-JRC was determined using the CT-images of the subjects (geometric GH-JRC) and was also estimated using the two IHA and SCoRE methods. The rotation centers determined using the IHA and SCoRE methods were on average 1. 47 ± 0. 62 cm and 2. 07 ± 0. 55 cm away from geometric GH-JRC, respectively.

The performance of students on the SRQs was also compared with two external measures estimating aspects of professionalism in students; peer ratings of professionalism and their Conscientiousness Index, an objective measure of behaviours at medical school. - Methods: Item Response Theory (IRT) was used to analyse both question and student performance for SRQs relating to knowledge of professionalism, pure anatomy and skills. The relative difficulties, discrimination and 'guessabilities' of each theme of question were compared with each other using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Student performance on each topic was compared with the measures of conscientiousness and professionalism using parametric and non-parametric tests as appropriate. <b>A</b> <b>post-hoc</b> <b>analysis</b> of <b>power</b> for the IRT modelling was conducted using a Monte Carlo simulation. - Results: Professionalism items were less difficult compared to the anatomy and skills SRQs, poorer at discriminating between candidates and more erratically answered when compared to anatomy questions. Moreover professionalism item performance was uncorrelated with the standardised Conscientiousness Index scores (rho= 0. 009, p= 0. 90). In contrast there were modest but significant correlations between standardised Conscientiousness Index scores and performance at anatomy items (rho= 0. 20, p= 0. 006) though not skills (rho=. 11, p=. 1). Likewise, students with high peer ratings for professionalism had superior performance on anatomy SRQs but not professionalism themed questions. A trend of borderline significance (p=. 07) was observed for performance on skills SRQs and professionalism nomination status. - Conclusions: SRQs related to professionalism are likely to have relatively poor psychometric properties and lack associations with other constructs associated with undergraduate professional behaviour. The findings suggest that such questions should not be included in undergraduate examinations and may raise issues with the introduction of Situational Judgement Tests into Foundation Years selection...|$|R
