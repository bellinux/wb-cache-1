5|$|In March 2004 an Internet hoax stated rumours about a lost 1956 {{version of}} Moonraker by Orson Welles, and <b>a</b> <b>James</b> Bond web site {{repeated}} it on April Fool's Day in 2004 as a hoax. Supposedly, this recently discovered lost film was 40 minutes of raw footage with Dirk Bogarde as Bond, Welles as Drax, and Peter Lorre as Drax's henchman.|$|E
5|$|It {{is first}} {{recorded}} in local records as Osborne Street in 1877, and given its present name in 1882. According to education historian Alison Wheatley, {{the street is}} possibly named after <b>a</b> <b>James</b> Turner who taught at King Edward's School in Birmingham, and the name may have been suggested by a former pupil, who became a town planner, {{as a way of}} honouring Turner's legacy. However, the Birmingham historian Carl Chinn believes the street was named for a local businessman and partner in the firm Hammond, Turner & Sons, a manufacturer of buttons.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the KGB general {{set up by}} Koskov was to be General Gogol; however, Walter Gotell was {{too sick}} to handle the major role, and the {{character}} of Leonid Pushkin replaced Gogol, who appears briefly {{at the end of}} the film, having transferred to the Soviet diplomatic service. This was Gogol's final appearance in <b>a</b> <b>James</b> Bond film. Morten Harket, the lead vocalist of the Norwegian rock group A-ha (which performed the film's title song), was offered a small role as a villain's henchman in the film, but declined, because of lack of time and because he felt they wanted to cast him due to his popularity rather than his acting.|$|E

5|$|In early 1934, {{the ship}} and her crew were {{featured}} in <b>a</b> <b>James</b> Cagney film for Warner Brothers, Here Comes the Navy, which made extensive use of exterior footage as well as on-board location shots. In the early morning of 26 July, Arizona collided with a fishing trawler, Umatilla, that was under tow by another trawler off Cape Flattery. Two men aboard the Umatilla {{were killed in the}} collision and the Navy convened a Court of Inquiry to investigate the incident. The court recommended that the ship's captain, Captain MacGillivray Milne, be court-martialed. This took place at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, while the ship was participating in that year's Fleet Problem off the East Coast. Milne was judged guilty and replaced several months later by Captain George Baum after the ship returned to the West Coast. In the meantime, Rear Admiral Samuel W. Bryant assumed command of Battleship Division Two on 4 September, with Arizona as his flagship.|$|E
5|$|In mid-May 1940, {{eight months}} after the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Browning, promoted to brigadier, was given command of the 128th (Hampshire) Infantry Brigade (consisting of three battalions, the 1/4th, 2/4th and 5th, of the Hampshire Regiment). Part of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, then commanded by Major-General Robert Pollok, the brigade was a Territorial Army unit that was preparing to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. This was pre-empted by the Dunkirk evacuation and the subsequent fall of France in June, and the division assumed a defensive posture. In February 1941, handing over the brigade to Brigadier M. <b>A.</b> <b>James,</b> Browning took command of the 24th Guards Brigade Group, whose objective was to defend London from an attack from the south.|$|E
5|$|The {{likeness}} of the Captain Scarlet character has, {{since his first}} appearance, been attributed to Francis Matthews, who voiced Scarlet in the series, Cary Grant and Roger Moore. Ed Bishop later claimed that Captain Blue had been modelled on his likeness, but sculptor Terry Curtis states that he made the puppet to resemble himself and simply added a blond wig when he learnt that Bishop was to voice Blue. Curtis, <b>a</b> <b>James</b> Bond fan, based the appearance of Captain Grey on Sean Connery and Destiny Angel on Ursula Andress, Connery's co-star in the 1962 Bond film Dr No. Meanwhile, the character of Lieutenant Green was sculpted on its voice actor, Cy Grant; Rhapsody Angel on model and actress Jean Shrimpton; Melody Angel on singer and actress Eartha Kitt; and Harmony Angel on actress Tsai Chin.|$|E
