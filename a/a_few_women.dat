5|$|One {{chronology}} {{assumes that}} the Aitareya, Taittiriya, Kausitaki, Mundaka, Prasna, and Katha Upanishads has Buddha's influence, and is consequently placed after the 5th century BCE, while another proposal questions this assumption and dates it independent of Buddha's date of birth. After these Principal Upanishads are typically placed the Kena, Mandukya and Isa Upanishads, but other scholars date these differently. Not much {{is known about the}} authors except for those, like Yajnavalkayva and Uddalaka, mentioned in the texts. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>women</b> discussants, such as Gargi and Maitreyi, the wife of Yajnavalkayva, also feature occasionally.|$|E

5|$|After her defeat, Dallas {{worked in}} private {{business}} {{after her husband}} suffered several strokes {{and was forced to}} retire. Initially, she worked as an associate editor at the Philadelphia Daily News. In 1959, she was hired as an investment banker at Dehaven & Townsend, Crouter & Bodine. As in politics, she was one of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>women</b> working in a male-dominated profession. When her husband died, Dallas moved out of their Chestnut Hill home to a retirement community in Delaware County, but continued working until the age of 76. She also remained active on several charitable boards including serving as a commissioner of Valley Forge State Park (now Valley Forge National Historical Park) and in the nonpartisan watchdog group, the Committee of Seventy. She died on January 13, 1983, and was buried alongside her husband in the churchyard of Church of St. James the Less in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Once in the Klondike, {{very few}} women—less than one percent—actually worked as miners. Many {{were married to}} miners; however, their lives as {{partners}} on the gold fields were still hard and often lonely. They had extensive domestic duties, including thawing ice and snow for water, breaking up frozen food, chopping wood and collecting wild foods. In Dawson and other towns, some women took in laundry to make money. This was a physically demanding job, but could be relatively easily combined with child care duties. Others took jobs in the service industry, for example as waitresses or seamstresses, which could pay well, but were often punctuated by periods of unemployment. Both men and women opened roadhouses, but women {{were considered to be}} better at running them. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>women</b> worked in the packing trade, carrying goods on their backs, or became domestic servants.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 25/26 June, SAO Krajina forces {{took control of the}} police station in Dvor and {{attacked}} the police station in Glina. The rebels managed to capture the police station in Glina for less than an hour before they were pushed back by the Lučko Anti-Terrorist Unit and police reinforcements deployed from Sisak. Croatian police casualties amounted to one killed and six wounded. Even though the attack in Glina did not leave SAO Krajina in control of the police station in Glina, 16 Croatian policemen were captured and held hostage. The prisoners were taken to the Knin camp and a detention facility in Golubić. In response to the fighting, the JNA deployed its troops to the two towns. New fighting erupted the same day near Hrvatska Kostajnica. In the final days of June, many Serb civilians, especially from Dvor, fled to the area of Bosanski Novi for safety. By 28 June, only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>women,</b> children and the elderly remained in Glina. The town's shops were closed and its streets were patrolled by JNA armoured vehicles. After the fighting, the JNA positioned its troops around the police station, while the Croatian Serb rebels controlled the rest of the town.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from the}} 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when {{manpower}} shortages saw many Palmach and IDF women taking {{active part in}} land battles, women were historically barred from battle in the IDF, serving {{in a variety of}} technical and administrative support roles. Soon after the establishment of the IDF, the removal of all women from front-line positions was decreed. Decisive for this decision was the very real possibility of falling into enemy hands as prisoners of war. It was fair and equitable to demand from women equal sacrifice and risk, it was argued, but the risk for women prisoners of rape and sexual molestation was infinitely greater than the same risk for men. A majority of women serving in the IDF then were secretaries. The rest served primarily as instructors, nurses, clerks and telephone operators. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>women</b> flew transport missions in the 1950s and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>women</b> were accepted into flight training in the 1970s, but did not complete the program before it was closed to women.|$|E

25|$|During the Yom Kippur War, due to {{a growing}} need for ground forces, women were needed in roles in the field. According to Rina Bar-Tal, chair of the Israel Women's Network, roles for women beyond {{technical}} and secretarial support only started to open up in the late 1970s and early '80s, because of manpower shortages. Since then, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>women</b> have earned ranks higher than colonel. In 1986, Amira Dotan, then head of the Women's Corps, became the first female brigadier-general.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} why several nations with few female workers {{have such a}} high {{percentage}} of salaried women. One possible explanation is that so few women are active in the labor market because the demand for female employment is restricted to a few higher-paying, low-labor-intensive industries. If only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>women</b> are needed but they need to have above-average skills, then these laborers' marginal value may necessitate salary as opposed to simple wages.

It was split into squads, {{each of which}} was led by a Senior NCO who {{had served in the}} Special Air Service (SAS), Special Boat Service (SBS), the Royal Marines or the Parachute Regiment.

25|$|During the {{construction}} of the Panama Canal by the Americans (1904-1914), the West Indian migrations to Panama constituted a demographic tidal wave, the largest yet in Caribbean history. Officially, canal authorities brought over 31,000 West Indian men and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>women.</b> But in fact, contemporaries estimated that between 150,000 and 200,000 men and women must have migrated during the decade 1904-1914. Most did not plan to stay in Panama. Eventually though, tens of thousands remained on the isthmus because the islands offered few opportunities that could compete with the pay and benefits available in Panama. The West Indians settled, married, had children, and became the largest immigrant group in the sparsely populated country. The descendants of these immigrants are known today as Afro-Panamanians.|$|E
25|$|The {{music of}} the cycle is thick and richly textured, and grows in {{complexity}} as the cycle proceeds. Wagner wrote for an orchestra of gargantuan proportions, including a greatly enlarged brass section with new instruments such as the Wagner tuba, bass trumpet and contrabass trombone. Remarkably, he uses a chorus only relatively briefly, in acts 2 and 3 of Götterdämmerung, and then mostly of men with just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>women.</b> He eventually had a purpose-built theatre constructed, the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, in which to perform this work. The theatre has a special stage that blends the huge orchestra with the singers' voices, allowing them to sing at a natural volume. The result was that the singers {{did not have to}} strain themselves vocally during the long performances.|$|E
