5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century German horticulturalists devoted many {{efforts to develop}} new Riesling hybrids that would create a more flexible, less temperamental grape that could still retain some of the elegant {{characteristics}} of Riesling. The most notable is the Müller-Thurgau developed in the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute in 1882, which is a cross of Riesling and Madeleine Royale (although long believed to be Riesling x Silvaner). Other Riesling/Silvaner crosses include the Palatinate regional favorite Scheurebe and Rieslaner.

5|$|Monastic reform {{became an}} {{important}} issue during the 11th century, as elites began to worry that monks were not adhering to the rules binding them to a strictly religious life. Cluny Abbey, founded in the Mâcon region of France in 909, was established {{as part of the}} Cluniac Reforms, a larger movement of monastic reform in response to this fear. Cluny quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigour. It sought to maintain <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> of spiritual life by placing itself under the protection of the papacy and by electing its own abbot without interference from laymen, thus maintaining economic and political independence from local lords.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} also {{considered}} {{a sign of}} the arrival of the Jet age, the Il-10, which had been considered <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> and effective conventional aircraft in World War II had been easily outmatched by the F-80 and its jet engine. The engagement was a rare example of an air-to-air battle at the early phase of the war, and North Korean forces became much more cautious when deploying their aircraft in battle, knowing they were easily outnumbered and outmatched by UN forces. For the next several months, the UN forces enjoyed air supremacy, operating their air forces in support of ground combat virtually unopposed. The public perception of the F-80s, which had to this point been cautious, improved with news of the victories.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{objects in}} the collection display <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> of craftsmanship such that scholars doubt an indigenous origin. Taylor (1879), {{in one of the}} earliest works discussing the find, speculates that the objects could represent a part of the plunder acquired by Goths in the raids made on the Roman provinces of Moesia and Thrace (238 - 251). Another early theory, probably first proposed by Odobescu (1889) and picked up again by Giurascu (1976), identifies Athanaric, pagan king of the Gothic Thervingi, as the likely owner of the hoard, presumably acquired through the conflict with the Roman Emperor Valens in 369. The Goldhelm catalogue (1994) suggests that the objects could also be viewed as having been gifts made by Roman leaders to allied Germanic princes.|$|E

5|$|Wilson {{began playing}} with the Melbourne Cricket Club in the 1890–91 season. He played two premiership matches early in the season, against Port Melbourne and Richmond, but scored only 13 runs in two innings and was not called upon to bowl. He did not play in another senior premiership game until the next season. In a match against Wesley College in March 1891, he played <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> innings, scoring 121 runs. Several weeks later, while playing for MCC's seconds against South Melbourne's seconds, he took 13 wickets for 61 runs. The Tasmanian noted that it was pity he had not played that well earlier in the season, or he {{probably}} would have secured a permanent place in the first XI.|$|E
5|$|A {{tradition}} of cottage spinning and weaving and improvements to spinning technology by local inventors, Richard Arkwright and Samuel Crompton, led to {{rapid growth of}} the textile industry in the 19th century. Crompton, whilst living at Hall i' th' Wood, invented the ] in 1779. Streams draining the surrounding moorland into the River Croal provided the water necessary for the bleach works that were a feature of this area. Bleaching using chlorine {{was introduced in the}} 1790s by the Ainsworths at Halliwell Bleachworks. Bolton and the surrounding villages had more than thirty bleachworks including the Lever Bank Bleach Works in the Irwell Valley. The mule revolutionised cotton spinning by combining the roller drafting of Arkwright's water frame with the carriage drafting and spindle tip twisting of James Hargreaves's spinning jenny, producing <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> yarn. Self-acting mules were used in Bolton mills until the 1960s producing fine yarn. The earliest mills were situated by the streams and river as at Barrow Bridge, but steam power led to the construction of the large multi-storey mills and their chimneys that dominated Bolton's skyline, some of which survive today.|$|E

5|$|After the {{religious}} and political upheavals of the seventeenth century, the universities recovered with a lecture-based curriculum that embraced economics and science, offering <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> liberal education to {{the sons of the}} nobility and gentry. It helped them to become major centres of medical education and to put Scotland at the forefront of Enlightenment thinking. Key figures in the Scottish Enlightenment who had made their mark before the mid-eighteenth century included Francis Hutcheson (1694–1746), who was professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow. He was an important link between the ideas of Shaftesbury and the later school of Scottish Common Sense Realism. Colin Maclaurin (1698–1746) was chair of mathematics by the age of 19 at Marischal College, University of Aberdeen and the leading British mathematician of his era. Perhaps the most significant intellectual figure of this era in Scotland was David Hume (1711–76) whose Treatise on Human Nature (1738) and Essays, Moral and Political (1741) helped outline the parameters of philosophical empiricism and scepticism. and he would be a major influence of later Enlightenment figures including Adam Smith, Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the kakapo's {{breeding}} system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely {{be able to produce}} eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.|$|E

In the final, O'Sullivan played Mark Selby. In the first session after O'Sullivan went 2–1 up, Selby took advantage of errors by O'Sullivan to win 5 straight frames. However, in <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> second session, O'Sullivan fought back to close to within one frame at 7–8, but Selby prevailed winning the next two frames and the title 7–10. In the last six frames of the match, a total of 5 century breaks were made, 2 by O'Sullivan of 134 and 130.
