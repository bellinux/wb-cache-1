Oil palm solid waste, rice husk, coconut shell and sawdust from wood are being disposed in an uncontrolled manner presently. Alternatively, this biomass {{can be used to}} produce energy by controlled combustion system or gasification process. This process produces producer gas that could generate electrical or mechanical energy. Pressurized induced flow was utilized in a downdraft gasifier with low emission burner. In this research, downdraft gasifier was coupled together with an <b>air</b> <b>ejector,</b> orifice cylinder and gas burner. Palm oil (Elaeis guineensis) shell and coal were used as feed. The solid feeds were combusted at a controlled condition inside the gasifier. Primary compressed air was supplied to assist the process. The process produced producer gas, which was consisted of methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Producer gas flowed out from the gasifier to the orifice cylinder and gas burner to re-burn again. Secondary compressed air was supplied to the gas burner through an <b>air</b> <b>ejector</b> to assist the burning process. This ejector also acted as an induced flow. High pressure and high velocity air streaming through the ejector caused pressure inside of the gas burner to drop. This situation allowed producer gas inside of gasifier, which was at a higher pressure to flow into the gas burner. The orifice cylinderâ€™s function was to enhance the air-fuel ratio mixture before it was being burnt. <b>Air</b> <b>ejector</b> configuration was carried out using computer simulation software, FLUENT 5. 3.
