5|$|The {{count of}} dorsal scales, from <b>axilla</b> (armpit) to groin, averages 32 {{with a range}} of 30 to 35. The ventral count from <b>axilla</b> to groin along the midventral line averages 28 scales and ranges from 26 to 29. The scales around the midbody average {{approximately}} 52 and range from 50 to 55. There are two postnasals and one to three (usually two) internasal scales. There are two to three (usually three) scales from the upper lip to the eye (upper labials). On the fourth toe of the right foot, there are eight or nine (usually eight) lamellae, or plate-like scales that provide traction for geckos. The escutcheons (scales around the genital region) are relatively small and only slightly extend onto the thighs, varying from three to five scales in length and 11 to 13 scales in width.|$|E
25|$|Vascularized {{lymph node}} {{transfers}} (VLNT) {{can be an}} effective treatment of the arm and upper extremity. Lymph nodes are harvested from the groin area with their supporting artery and vein and moved to the <b>axilla</b> (armpit). Microsurgery techniques connect the artery and vein to blood vessels in the <b>axilla</b> to provide support to the lymph nodes while they develop their own blood supply over the first few weeks after surgery.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is {{indicated}} for {{axillary lymph node}} metastasis-negative cases (N 0), but clarification of the indication may increase treatment efficiency. Fluorine- 18 -labeled 2 -fluoro- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) may have a high positive predictive value in diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis. Methods: Ninety-two breasts/axillae were analyzed retrospectively in 90 patients (median age 54. 6 -year old, median primary tumor 1. 7 cm). FDG-PET/computed tomography was used to indicate SNB in N 0 cases. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed in cases that were axillary lymph node metastasis-positive (PET Nþ) on FDG-PET/CT. Results: Seventy-four (80. 4 %) and 18 (19. 6 %) of the 92 <b>axillae</b> were diagnosed as metasta-sis-negative (PET N 0) and PET Nþ, respectively, by FDG-PET/CT. SNB was performed in 51 of the 74 PET N 0 <b>axillae.</b> ALND was performed in 23 PET N 0 <b>axillae</b> (at the patients’ request) and in all 18 PET Nþ <b>axillae.</b> Of the 74 PET N 0 <b>axillae,</b> 14 were metastasis-positive (pNþ) and 60 were pN 0 pathologically, and of the 18 PET Nþ <b>axillae,</b> 13 were pNþ and five were pN 0. The sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET/CT for diagnosis of axillary metastasis were 48. 1 and 92. 3 %, respectively, and {{the positive and negative}} predictive values were 72. ...|$|R

25|$|There {{are several}} {{techniques}} for blocking the nerves of the brachial plexus. These techniques are classified by {{the level at}} which the needle or catheter is inserted for injecting the local anesthetic — interscalene block on the neck, supraclavicular block immediately above the clavicle, infraclavicular block below the clavicle and axillary block in the <b>axilla</b> (armpit).|$|E
25|$|Disadvantages of the {{axillary}} block include inadequate anesthesia in {{the distribution}} of the musculocutaneous nerve. This nerve supplies motor function to the biceps, brachialis, and coracobrachialis muscles and one of its branches supplies sensation to the skin of the forearm. If the musculocutaneous nerve is missed, {{it may be necessary to}} block this nerve separately. This can be accomplished by using a peripheral nerve stimulator to identify the location of the nerve as it passes through the coracobrachialis muscle. The intercostobrachial nerves (which are branches of the second and third intercostal nerves) are also frequently missed with the axillary block. Because these nerves supply sensation to the skin of the medial and posterior aspects of the arm and <b>axilla,</b> a tourniquet on the arm may be poorly tolerated in such cases. Subcutaneous injection of local anesthetic over the medial aspect of the arm in the <b>axilla</b> helps patients tolerate an arm tourniquet by blocking these nerves.|$|E
25|$|Transaxillary: an {{incision}} {{made to the}} <b>axilla</b> (armpit), {{from which}} the dissection tunnels medially, to emplace the implants, either bluntly or with an endoscope (illuminated video microcamera), without producing visible scars on the breast proper; yet, it is likelier to produce inferior asymmetry of the implant-device position. Therefore, surgical revision of transaxillary emplaced breast implants usually requires either an IMF incision or a periareolar incision.|$|E

25|$|Suspensory ligaments. The {{subcutaneous}} {{layer of}} adipose {{tissue in the}} breast is traversed with thin suspensory ligaments (Cooper's ligaments) that extend obliquely to the skin surface, and from the skin to the deep pectoral fascia. The structural stability provided by the Cooper's ligaments derives from its closely packed bundles of collagen fibers oriented in parallel; the principal, ligament-component cell is the fibroblast, interspersed throughout the parallel collagen-fiber bundles of the shoulder, <b>axilla,</b> and thorax ligaments.|$|E
25|$|The {{brachial plexus}} is {{formed by the}} ventral rami of C5-C6-C7-C8-T1, {{occasionally}} with small contributions by C4 and T2.

25|$|The TUG flap (also the TMG flap) {{consists}} of the gracilis muscle and a transversely-oriented island of skin and fat on the superior inner thigh. Sacrifice of the gracilis muscle does not result in functional impairment. The TUG flap is nourished by the ascending branch of the medial circumflex femoral artery with two venae comitantes, which come from the profunda femoris vessels. The vessels are routinely anastomosed to the internal mammary vessels, instead of to the thoraco-dorsal vessels in the <b>axilla,</b> because the blood vessels of the TUG flap are relatively short.|$|E

The back is brown, and the underparts, arms and legs are whitish-yellow. The rump and inner thighs and upper tail are reddish-orange. The fur is distributed with varying densities throughout the body: the genital region (scrotum and pubic zone), <b>axilla,</b> and the base of the tail have lower densities, while the forward region is much higher. Many individuals have stripes or whorls of fur of striking coloration on their throats. The cotton-top also has whiskers on its forehead and around its mouth.|$|E
25|$|The first {{percutaneous}} supraclavicular {{block was}} performed in 1911 by German surgeon Diedrich Kulenkampff (18801967). Just as his older colleague August Bier (18611949) had done with spinal anesthesia in 1898, Kulenkampff subjected himself to the supraclavicular block. Later that year, Georg Hirschel (18751963) described a percutaneous approach to the brachial plexus from the <b>axilla.</b> In 1928, Kulenkampff and Persky published their experiences with a thousand blocks without apparent major complications. They described their technique with the patient in the sitting position or in the supine position with a pillow between the shoulders. The needle was inserted above {{the midpoint of the}} clavicle where the pulse of the subclavian artery could be felt and it was directed medially toward the second or third thoracic spinous process.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the accuracy of ultrasonog-raphy alone and in combination with fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) for detection of axillary metastases of nonpalpable lymph nodes in breast cancer patients. Ultrasonography was carried out in 150 <b>axillas</b> of 148 patients (mean age 57 years, range 30 – 80 years); and in 93 <b>axillas</b> lymph nodes were detected. Nodes were described according to their dimension and echo patterns and were compared with histopathologic results. FNAB was carried out in 81 <b>axillas</b> (122 nodes). The sensitivity of ultrasonography was highest (87 %) when size (length> 5 mm) was used as criterion for malignancy, but the specificity was rather low (56 %). When nodes with a malignant pattern (echo-poor or inhomogeneous) were visualized, specificity was 95 %. Ultrasound-guided FNAB had a sensitivity of 80 % and a specificity of 100 % and detected metastases in 63 % of node-positive patients. It is concluded that FNAB is an easy, reliable, inexpensive method for identifying patients with positive nodes...|$|R

25|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, {{clinical}} experience with brachial plexus block in both peacetime and wartime surgery was extensive, and {{new approaches to}} this technique began to be described. For example, In 1946, F. Paul Ansbro {{was the first to}} describe a continuous brachial plexus block technique. He secured a needle in the supraclavicular fossa and attached tubing connected to a syringe through which he could inject incremental doses of local anesthetic. The subclavian perivascular block was first described by Winnie and Collins in 1964. This approach became popular due to its lower risk of pneumothorax compared to the traditional Kulenkampff approach. The infraclavicular approach was first developed by Raj. In 1977, Selander described a technique for continuous brachial plexus block using an intravenous catheter secured in the <b>axilla.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{axillary}} {{block is}} particularly useful in providing anesthesia and postoperative analgesia for surgery to the elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand. The axillary block {{is also the}} safest of the four main approaches to the brachial plexus, as it does not risk paresis of the phrenic nerve, nor does it {{have the potential to}} cause pneumothorax. In the <b>axilla,</b> the nerves of the brachial plexus and the axillary artery are enclosed together in a fibrous sheath which is a continuation of the deep cervical fascia. The easily palpated axillary artery thus serves as a reliable anatomical landmark for this block, and the injection of local anesthetic close to this artery frequently leads to a good block of the brachial plexus. The axillary block is commonly performed due to its ease of performance and relatively high success rate.|$|E
25|$|In women, {{the breasts}} overlay the pectoralis major muscles and usually extend from {{the level of}} the second rib to {{the level of the}} sixth rib in the front of the human rib cage; thus, the breasts cover much of the chest area and the chest walls. At the front of the chest, the breast tissue can extend from the {{clavicle}} (collarbone) to the middle of the sternum (breastbone). At the sides of the chest, the breast tissue can extend into the <b>axilla</b> (armpit), and can reach as far to the back as the latissimus dorsi muscle, extending from the lower back to the humerus bone (the longest bone of the upper arm). As a mammary gland, the breast is composed of differing layers of tissue, predominantly two types: adipose tissue; and glandular tissue, which affects the lactation functions of the breasts.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effects of a}} skin protectant solution (dimethicone 2 %) on clinical signs and skin barrier function in canine atopic dermatitis (AD). Eighteen dogs with AD were randomly divided into two groups, one received dimethicone and the other received the vehicle (cyclomethicone) on selected areas (pinnae, groin, and <b>axillae)</b> daily for 4 weeks. Owners and investigators were blinded regarding group allocation. Clinical efficacy was evaluated using a scoring system and skin barrier by measuring the transepidermal water loss. Twelve dogs completed the study (50 % drop rate in the vehicle and 20 % in the dimethicone). For clinical signs, analysis of variance showed an effect of time (; day 0 day 28) and region (<b>axillae</b> groin pinnae) but no effect of group or group × time interaction. For transepidermal water loss, analysis of variance showed only a main effect of region (<b>axillae</b> pinnae groin). Pearson found no correlation between transepidermal water loss and clinical scores. In this pilot study dimethicone had no significant effect on clinical signs and transepidermal water loss in canine atopic dermatitis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExtramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) {{is a rare}} intraepidermal {{carcinoma}} and predominantly involves apocrine gland-bearing areas, such as anogenital {{regions and}} <b>axillae.</b> EMPD usually involves a solitary area and, less often, two areas in the same patient (double EMPD).

25|$|During the operation, {{the lymph}} nodes in the <b>axilla</b> are also {{considered}} for removal. In the past, large axillary operations took out 10 to 40 nodes to establish whether cancer had spread. This had the unfortunate side effect of frequently causing lymphedema of the arm on the same side, as the removal of this many lymph nodes affected lymphatic drainage. More recently, the technique of sentinel lymph node (SLN) dissection has become popular, as it requires the removal of far fewer lymph nodes, resulting in fewer side effects while achieving the same 10-year survival as its predecessor. The sentinel lymph node is the first node that drains the tumor, and subsequent SLN mapping can save 65-70% of patients with breast cancer from having a complete lymph node dissection for what {{could turn out to}} be a negative nodal basin. Advances in Sentinel Lymph Node mapping over the past decade have increased the accuracy of detecting Sentinel Lymph Node from 80% using blue dye alone to between 92% and 98% using combined modalities. SLN biopsy is indicated for patients with T1 and T2 lesions (<5nbsp&cm) and carries a number of recommendations for use on patient subgroups. Recent trends continue to favor less radical axillar node resection even in the presence of some metastases in the sentinel node.|$|E

Also, S.nicholsi has only 34 to 42 scales around the midbody compared to 50 to 55 in S.parthenopion, and its ventral scales from <b>axilla</b> to groin range from 21 to 26, which is still less than 26 to 29 in S.parthenopion. S.nicholsi typically has one internasal scale versus the two more commonly seen in S.parthenopion. The escutcheons are also larger in male S.nicholsi, on average. In terms of colouration, both species are very similar, but S.nicholsi usually has a crescent-shaped pattern on its head that touches the postocular stripes, instead of an oval-shaped pattern {{that may or may not}} reach the stripes. Also, its postocular stripes run the length of its body and tail instead of ending on the neck. The dorsolateral stripes of S.nicholsi converge to make a dark-edged U- or Y-shaped pattern in the sacral (pelvic) region.
