Around 1803 he began cooperating with Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, who was now working for the Russian authorities. Around that time, he and Czartoryski authored <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> European federal organization of states intended to prevent armed conflicts and to maintain perpetual peace. Piattoli, through Czartoryski, briefly worked in the diplomatic service and administration of the Russians, too. Like Czartoryski, Piattoli tried to push for a more lenient and friendly attitude towards Poland at the Russian court, but with little success.|$|E

The scheme received little attention and was almost immediately superseded by plans to develop the area as the site of the Festival of Britain. Holden was also architectural and planning consultant to the University of Edinburgh and to the Borough of Tynemouth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1986, the Huntington Development Corporation {{suggested}} that an off-track betting facility be constructed, however, the idea died after Governor Arch Moore vetoed an off-track betting bill that was critical to the project's success. In 1987, the Webb Companies presented <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> $110 million mixed-use complex called RiverCenter that would feature a 20-story office tower, an underground parking garage and a skyway to the Harris Riverfront Park. The project failed when two large tenants {{could not be found}} to anchor the project. In 1988, the city's grant to help develop the project was revoked.|$|E

5|$|No-one had {{questioned}} Calvert's conformity at the time, {{and if he}} {{had been}} secretly Catholic, he had hidden it well. It seems more likely Calvert converted in late 1624. At the time, Simon Stock, a Discalced Carmelite priest reported to the Congregation Propaganda Fide in Rome on 15 November that he had converted two Privy Councillors to Catholicism, one of whom historians are certain was Calvert. Calvert, who had probably met Stock at the Spanish embassy in London, later worked with the priest on <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Catholic mission in his new first Newfoundland Colony (off modern Canada).|$|E
5|$|On 5 February 1942, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George C.

Somervell, now the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-4, and Styer drew up <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new, overarching logistics command initially known as the Services of Supply.

In the 1980s, as school enrollment declined and costs increased, the Grade School building was leased to Pace University and the remaining students in that building (grades six through eight) occupied {{a portion of the}} new High School building. In 1988, <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> larger village and school meeting and performance area was initiated. A new auditorium {{was completed in}} 1998.

5|$|After the war, Gellibrand {{returned}} to Tasmania. He boarded the troopship RMS Kaiser-i-Hind in London on 4 May 1919, and reached Hobart on 30 June, {{after a long}} sea voyage, a rail trip from Fremantle to Melbourne, passage across the Bass Strait, and a week in quarantine on Bruny Island due to the 1918 flu pandemic. As Tasmania's highest-ranking war hero, he was greeted by the Governor of Tasmania, Sir Francis Newdegate. On August 1919 he accepted an offer from the Premier of Tasmania, Walter Lee, of the post of Public Service Commissioner. He investigated {{the conditions of the}} service, and found that public servants were agitating for a 40 per cent pay rise, as no pay rises had been granted since before the war. He came up with <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> temporary reclassification of positions, which would offer some relief, at a cost to the government of £12,000. This was implemented in December. On 19 July 1920, he was formally knighted by the Prince of Wales.|$|E
5|$|COSSAC {{was charged}} with {{planning}} three operations: Operation Cockade, a deception operation to keep German forces pinned to the coast; Operation Rankin, a plan for measures {{to be taken in}} the case of a sudden German collapse; and Operation Overlord, <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> full-scale assault on north western Europe. Morgan and his staff worked on the Overlord plan throughout June and the first half of July 1943. He presented it to the Chiefs of Staff Committee on 15 July. The plan set forth in detail the conditions under which the assault could be made, the area where a landing would be feasible, and the means by which a lodgement on the continent would be developed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{a group of}} St. Louis {{residents}} drew up <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> revitalized downtown, which included a sculpture garden at the same two blocks where Citygarden is located. That plan was not immediately realized, but in 2006, the City of St. Louis asked the Gateway Foundation to prepare a master plan for the entire Gateway Mall strip. In early 2007, the foundation sponsored a competition, soliciting designs for the planned project; Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects, a Charlottesville, Virginia landscape architecture firm, was the winner. The partnership to develop Citygarden was announced in June 2007. The project was initially proposed to the St. Louis Preservation Board in October 2007, while development of the land began in April 2008. Over 250,000 people visited Citygarden before Christmas, 2009, a figure that has since risen to an estimated one million or more. However, because Citygarden has no gates, there is no official visitor count.|$|E
5|$|On July 8, 1758, James Abercromby {{attacked}} Fort Carillon on Lake Champlain, but was repelled {{with heavy}} losses. In August, Montgomery and the 17th foot sailed to Boston, marched {{to join with}} Abercromby's forces in Albany and then moved to Lake George. On November 9, Abercromby was recalled; Amherst replaced him as commander-in-chief. The British high command, for the 1759 campaign, developed <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> three-pronged attack into Canada, in which forces including the 17th foot would assault Fort Carillon and also capture Fort St. Frédéric, near Crown Point, New York. Under Amherst's command, Montgomery and the 17th Foot participated in the capture of Fort Carillon. While the army was gathering prior to the battle, Montgomery's company was on guard duty; he ordered his men to remain vigilant for French and Indian ambush parties. On May 9 his suspicions proved correct when 12 men from the 17th were attacked. Montgomery and the 17th met stiff resistance at first. Montgomery ordered that his men were not to fire at night, fearing they would shoot their comrades. On July 21, the army began its movement toward Fort Carillon; by the 26th they were in position outside the fort's walls, from which the French had already withdrawn most of their forces to Fort St. Frédéric. That night, after some exchange of cannon fire during the day, the French blew up Carillon's powder magazine, and Fort St. Frédéric the next day, and withdrew {{to the far end}} of Lake Champlain.|$|E
