5000|$|Accordingly, Ginastera {{uses his}} {{signature}} guitar chord twice in this piece, a tied thirty second note ascending arpeggiation of E-A-D-G-B-E, representing the open strings of the gaucho’s guitar. This chord, with its intensely Argentine connotations, appears [...] "like sherbet between courses, to cleanse the palate" [...] (Alison Dalton, violinist, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, interview by editor of this article, 1996) throughout Ginastera’s career, in nearly <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genres</b> {{in which he}} composed. Though a similar harmonic resonance is achieved by playing nearly any series of four perfect fourths and a major third, the ubiquitous chord is most frequently spelled as above in Ginastera's compositions, regardless of the tonal center (or lack thereof) of the piece in which the chord appears. Consequently, if [...] "Triste" [...] is to be performed in transposition, the performers must consider the specific sonority of the E-A-D-G-B-E chord and whether it too should be transposed or left as written.|$|E

40|$|The libretti by the Viennese court poet Pietro Metastasio {{dominated}} the Continental and London music scenes {{for much of}} the 18 th century; almost no composer worth his salt failed to set one of his texts at some stage, {{and by the end of}} the century, there were some 300 settings of the 27 operas alone. The smaller entertainments and the oratorios were similarly popular, and works in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genres</b> became part of the London repertoire. The primary aim of this article is to provide a framework for the study of Metastasio on the stage in London, examining in precisely what form they reached the public and how the arias they contain became a resource for those working in the London theatres. It is also concerned with the extent of Metastasio’s influence in the theatre in Great Britain, and shows that Metastasio’s works could be located in nearly every theatre season and could be found in every publishing house and music shop. The picture that emerges is of a poet revered by the British public, and ever-present in the operas they saw and in the texts they read for over eighty years. The catalogue is divided into three main sections - I: Operas, II: Feste, Azioni, Componimenti, and III: Oratorios, and has four appendices. The first two deal entitled ‘Some Lost or Missing 18 th-Century Metastasio printed libretti and texts for London’ and ‘Some Metastasio “London ghosts”’, The third, ‘Metastasio’s works in performance’ details season by season the number of performances of Metastasio’s works in London. The last, ‘Metastasio aria texts used in London in operas other than their original context’, provides a list of Metastasio arias which were re-employed in both other operas by Metastasio, or in works wholly unconnected with their original usage...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{year long}} in-depth, {{longitudinal}} case study of Noa, a six-year-old female in a bilingual first grade class which documents and analyzes her literacy development in a multilingual setting. Data collection for the study includes: written artifacts, anecdotal records, informal interviews with Noa, formal interviews with Noa's teachers, and videotapes. The research questions and their answers are summarized as: (1) What types of written genres does Noa develop? Noa developed 25 different written genres. The genres were categorized according to the distinction between language {{as an end in}} itself and language as a means toward an end, based on Halliday's ideas of learning about language and learning through language. (2) How does Noa use Hebrew, English and Spanish in her writing development? English was Noa's predominant written language. Only 10 % of Noa's writings were written in languages other than English. (3) How does Noa use technology in her literacy development? Noa used the computer for two main reasons: as a stylistic device and as an ownership device. (4) What kind of questions does Noa ask about language learning? Noa wondered aloud about language intensively during the duration of the study. (5) What types of tensions influence Noa's writings? Three types of tensions were documented: Language learning: between invention and convention. The genres categorized as language {{as an end in itself}} did not show any development throughout the year. In the genres categorized as language as a means toward an end, the tension between inventions and conventions were obvious and gave a clear sense of Noa's literacy development. Settings: between home and school. The settings in which Noa wrote impacted her writings. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genres</b> related to language as an end in itself were explored in the school setting only. Important relations between Noa's writing experiences at home and in the school were discussed. Editing: between teacher centered and student centered. Noa's editing provides insight about teacher centered and student centered editing. Noa's assimilation and accommodation of the teacher's editing behaviors and the student centered editing were discussed...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores how nineteenth-century Protestant women negotiated genre {{in order}} to manage more effectively the controversial rhetorical project of defending women's right to preach. After providing a comprehensive overview of the debate of women's preaching in America, this project presents a genre study of a subset of these defenses: those women who do not adhere strictly to their "home" genres, but rather demonstrate a range of generic blending and manipulation in their defenses of women's preaching. This study further reads religion as an integral identity category that was the seat for other activist rhetorics; by extension, then, women's defenses of women's preaching is an important site of activism and rhetorical discourse. Foote, Willard, and Woosley are rhetoricians and theologians; the hybrid form of their books provides them with a textual space for the intersections of their rhetoric and theology. This study examines three books within the tradition of defenses of women's preaching [...] Julia Foote's A Brand Plucked from the Fire (1879), Frances Willard's Woman in the Pulpit (1888), and Louisa Woosley's Shall Woman Preach? (1891) [...] as representative of the journey a genre takes from early adaptation to solidification, what Carolyn Miller calls "typified rhetorical action" (151) and as the containers for an egalitarian theology. Foote adapts the genre of spiritual autobiography to include the oral and textual discourses of letters, sermons, and hymn {{in order to}} present her holiness theology. Willard experiments with the epistolary genre in order to present her Social Gospel theology. Woosley includes <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genres</b> of defenses of women's preaching: sermon, spiritual autobiography, editorial letter, and speech; she also appropriates Masonic rhetoric in order to merge the defense of women's preaching with another kind of defense prevalent at the time: the scriptural defense of women. Significantly, each woman resolves "separate spheres" ideology by suggesting a new religious sphere {{where men and women}} participate equally: Foote's sphere is the sphere of holiness; Willard's is her reconceptualized Kingdom of God; and Woosley's is a world of action, where men and women, after ritualized initiation, are responsible for building the temple of God...|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "progressive rock", which {{appeared}} in <b>the</b> liner notes <b>of</b> Caravan's 1968 self-titled debut LP, came {{to be applied to}} bands that used classical music techniques to expand the styles and concepts available to rock music. The Nice, the Moody Blues, Procol Harum and Pink Floyd <b>all</b> contained elements <b>of</b> what is now called progressive rock, but none represented as complete an example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genre</b> as several bands that formed soon after.
