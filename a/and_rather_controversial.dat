In the ductile medium models, the Tibetan plateau is regarded as a ductile subsurface (England and Houseman 1989), and the crust is thickened {{as a result of the}} huge N–S shortening, which is expected to be accommodated through a continuous deformation of the lithospheric plate. Recent studies suggest the existence of a ‘channel flow’ in the mid- to lower crust of the plateau which might explain the varying and complex deformation of the Tibetan plateau (Bai et al. 2010; Clark and Royden 2000).|$|R

40|$|This article {{provides}} a critical {{reflection on the}} efforts at legal reconstruction initiated in 2001 {{by the international community}} and the Afghan government. Its aim is to highlight some of the more controversial factors that accompany the implementation of a foreign model of justice inspired by the ideology of the rule of law. Following Operation Enduring Freedom and the consequent arrival of various international agencies on Afghan soil, the international community (led by the United States) has attempted to bring political stability and democracy to Afghanistan. This endeavor has evolved into a more extensive, <b>and</b> <b>rather</b> <b>controversial,</b> process of reconstruction, which has called into question the mantra of democratization and modernization used to ideologically justify the US-led coalition control of a pro-Western Afghan government. By introducing a reflection on restorative justice and judicial mediation, I argue that the standardization and global circulation of specific models of justice present a series of problems often hidden behind legalistic interpretations. While in Western countries jurists and legal practitioners promote the industry of ‘alternative dispute resolution’ (ADR) and emphasize the recourse to mediation and conciliation, in Afghanistan governments and international agencies implement the rule of law, thus condemning and marginalizing customary practices in the resolution of disputes. Once taken away from the rules of the judicial order, judicial mediation becomes caught in a logic of compromise and deteriorates...|$|E

Being based on the notion that states have, on one hand, the responsibility to protect their own people and that the international community, on the other hand, has the responsibility to offer that protection in case of failure of individual states to do so, the RtoP has brought into question some of the most important principles of international law, primarily those of state sovereignty and of non-intervention in the internal affairs of foreign states. While there has been a consensus among the majority of states and legal scholars that humanitarian interventions have not become the part of customary law, this paper focuses on examining the effect of the new concept of RtoP on international law. It seeks to explore the notion of RtoP and how it differs from humanitarian intervention, as well as to analyze the attitude of states and international bodies towards it.

The {{combination of these}} symptoms causes a significant risk for the incidence of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a nuclear transcription factor functioning primarily as the master regulator of lipid und glucose metabolism. PPARγ is being studied extensively as a potential target molecule for metabolic therapeutics. Telmisartan is an angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist, but also {{has been shown to}} partially activate PPARγ. Numerous studies could show pleiotropic metabolic effects for Telmisartan. Its underlying mechanism is not yet completely understood <b>and</b> <b>rather</b> remains <b>controversial.</b> According to our hypothesis, Telmisartan’s pleiotropic, metabolic effects are mainly caused through the activation of PPARγ in adipose tissue. By the means of Cre/loxP-technology, we were able to create a functional knockout mouse model (FKO) without any relevant expression of PPARγ in adipose tissue. The following analyses of the PPARγ-deficient mice showed attenuation of the metabolic effects of Telmisartan and Pioglitazone, particularly in regard to glucose metabolism and body weight. The downstream regulation of the GLUT 4 gene by PPARγ impacts significantly the systemic glucose tolerance. Treating FKO mice with Telmisartan did not affect the GLUT 4 -mRNA expression in a significant manner. In summary, the current data of this in vivo mouse study show that the adipose tissue specific PPARγ plays an important role for the metabolic effects of Telmisartan...|$|R

Although the etiology of uterine diseases is mainly ascribed to bacterial infection, they can also be associated with viral infection, such as bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV- 4), which is often a secondary agent following bacteria. Besides microbial infection, many inflamma-tory molecules belonging to the innate immune response orchestrate the outcome of the infection. In the present study, the interaction between BoHV- 4 -infected bovine endometrial stromal cells and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) was investigated. Bovine herpesvirus 4 possesses a special tropism toward endometrial stromal cells. For this reason, a simian virus 40 (SV 40) immortalized endometrial stromal cell line (SV 40 BESC) was established; it was proven that it was stable, it expressed toll-like receptors (TLRs; from 1 to 10) and TNF-alpha receptors I and II, and it was responsive to exogenous TNF-alpha. Further, an increase of BoHV- 4 replication and cytopathic effect was observed in BoHV- 4 -infected and TNF-alpha-treated SV 40 BESCs. This increase of viral replication was associated with BoHV- 4 immediate early 2 (IE 2) gene promoter trans-activation through the interaction of the nuclear factor KB (NFKB) with the putative NFKB-responsive elements found within BoHV- 4 IE 2 gene promoter, and this interaction was abolished when NFKB-responsive elements were deleted. These data shed light on two important <b>and</b> <b>rather</b> <b>controversial</b> issues: the role of TNF-alpha receptor, which is weakly expressed in the stromal layer of the bovine uterus, as well as the possible interactions between proinflammatory molecules, viral replica-tion, and chronic uterine disease. bovine endometrial stromal cells, bovine herpesvirus 4, chemokine, interleukin 8, postpartum metriti...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} issues in the recent {{movement}} known as uritical Buddhism (hihan bukkyo) {{is the question of}} which version of the Shobogenzo represents Dogen authentic philosophical message. Critical Buddhism has rejected the conventional emphasis on the priority of the 75 -fascicle version，which contains the famous philosophical essays on “Buddha-nature ” (Bussho) and “Being-Time ” (Uji). Instead it empha sizes that the 12 -fascicle Shobogenzo, which was written toward the end of Dogen life and contains mainly practical instructions for monks in training, is the real or authentic text because of its critique of original-enlightenment thought and consistent focus on karmic causality. This paper examines the Critical Buddhist view in the light of responses by tra ditional Dogen scholars. The debate is framed and evaluated in the larger context of Buddhist scholasticism and hermeneutics in which scholars try to reinterpret medieval sources from a classical or foundational standpoint and in terms of distinctively modern concerns. The recent methodological movement in Buddhist studies known as Critical Buddhism (hihan bukkyd 批判仏孝文）is characterized by several far-ranging <b>and</b> <b>rather</b> <b>controversial</b> conclusions aimed at undermin ing the status quo in East Asian Buddhist orthodoxy and in the con ventional scholarship on Chinese and Japanese Buddn ism. 1 he Critical Buddhist scholars have soueht to reexamine many of the major developments in East Asian Buddhist thought in terms of their consistency with the fundamental Buddhist philosophy of causality expressed in Pali and early Mahayana Buddhist texts.

Morphology-based analyses were strongly affected by widespread homoplasy, while the molecular-based attempts struggled with the lack of sufficient phylogenetic signal. Despite significant improvements, the higher classification still remains unresolved <b>and</b> <b>rather</b> <b>controversial.</b> However, the use of the fossil record, one of the most valuable sources of information, was mainly limited to calibration of a phylogenetic tree, without a direct inclusion into the analysis. The extinct family Oviparosiphidae has long been considered as the common ancestor of all recent Aphidoidea and it was used as a calibration point in several analyses, but it has been never analyzed in a phylogenetic context. The family has been treated as a monophyletic group purely based on the simultaneous presence of two abdominal structures, ovipositor and siphunculi. However, it has been shown recently that at least one more extinct lineage, present at the same time, was characterized by the same features. For these reasons, we performed a maximum parsimony analysis using morphological data for extinct aphid taxa to prove the monophyly of Oviparosiphidae. Our analysis shows that the presumed ancestor lineage of recent aphids is a polyphyletic group. Our results support the hypothesis of an early Mesozoic rapid radiation of aphids, which led to several different lineages characterized by both ovipositor and siphunculi. The results indicate the necessity of examining the other extinct families, and shows that the diversity of aphids before the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution (KTR) was higher than expected.

40|$|There {{are many}} evidences that {{incidence}} of cancer, especially of oral and lip carcinoma in human increases with age. Notwithstanding considerable variations in types of the spontaneous tumors, experimental animals also demonstrate age-related increase in tumor incidence. The available {{data on a}} number of experiments involving administration of chemical carcinogenic agents to laboratory animals of different ages are inconsistent <b>and</b> <b>rather</b> <b>controversial,</b> because age-related decrease and increase in the sensitivity of cells and tissues to the carcinogen or no effect of age at all are widely observed. Metabolic activation and/or inactivation of a carcinogenic compound is undoubtedly {{one of the most important}} factors modifying the effect of aging on carcinogenesis. In the recent analyses, age-related changes in the activity of enzymes metabolizing carcinogens determine the effective dose of a damaging agent or its active metabolite. Nevertheless, it seems that at present the related data are too scarce to postulate a leading role for the age-related dynamics of carcinogen. It is also discussed in this paper that during normal life, radom heritable changes may occur by accident in many cells. When certain such changes are fully accumulated in a single (or a small number of) particular cell, the result may be proliferation into a recognizable cancer. However, of all the heritable changes that might occur in a cell, the majority will presumably ignoring lethal changes and irrelevant to carcinogenesis. In old age most cells must have suffered many non-lethal heritable changes by the same general mechanisms being involved in carcinogenesis. Many investigators have suggested that this accumulation of somatic changes is the fundamental process of aging. These random heritable changes arised in the particular cells of an organism would presumably affect not only the timespan of aging, but also that of carcinogenesis. If this is true, the age-associated accumulation of a carcinogenic dose acquired for tumor induction in susceptible individuals is a priori an important factor of an increase of frequency of cancer in old ages, even if aging itself does not affect carcinogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Oral {{lichen planus}} (OLP) is a chronic {{inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} oral mucosa and {{also one of the}} more common mucosal conditions mostly affecting middle aged individuals. Even though OLP is well investigated the etiology of this disease is still unknown, even if autoimmunity as a possible etiologic factor has been suggested. WHO classifies OLP as a pre malignant condition but malignant transformation of OLP is a matter of great controversy. The p 53 protein is a tumour suppressor with the potential to induce apoptosis or cell cycle arrest of DNA damaged cells. Another member of the p 53 family, p 63, comprises six different isoforms, and plays {{a crucial role in the}} formation of oral mucosa, salivary glands, teeth and skin. p 63 has also been suggested to be involved in development of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). β-catenin, E-cadherin and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are p 63 related proteins and abnormalities in their expression are suggested to be involved in development of SCCHN. Methods. Using immunohistochemistry and antibodies directed against p 53 and those distinguishing between the p 63 isoforms we analysed biopsies of OLP, SCCHN and normal oral tissue. We also mapped levels of p 63 and p 53 isoforms using RT-PCR technique. Furthermore expression of the p 63 related proteins β-catenin, E-cadherin and EGFR was studied using immunoblot analysis. In an attempt to investigate autoimmunity as a causative factor of OLP we analysed sera from patients diagnosed with OLP and matched control individuals in order to see if there were autoantibodies directed against the p 53 family. Results. When mapping p 53 and p 63 protein status decreased expression of p 63 and increased expression of p 53 was seen in OLP compared to normal tissue. In accordance with these results, levels of p 63 RNA were also lower in OLP lesions compared with normal tissue. Concerning p 53 isoforms, the “original” p 53 isoform was expressed in all OLP lesions and normal control tissue. Of the other isoforms, p 53 β and Δ 133 p 53 were expressed in the majority of samples. Our results regarding p 63 related proteins showed a generally lower expression of these proteins in OLP lesions compared to normal control tissue. When studying sera from patients with OLP we found circulating autoantibodies against all six p 63 and four p 73 isoforms in two patients. Conclusions. The potential for malignant transformation of OLP is still a subject of discussion <b>and</b> <b>rather</b> <b>controversial.</b> While some of our results regarding status of p 53 and p 63 both at protein and RNA levels support this theory, other results concerning for example p 63 related proteins point in the opposite direction. Based on our studies it is thus not possible to either support nor contradict the statement that OLP is a clear-cut premalignant condition. In our effort to understand the etiology of OLP we were the first to demonstrate autoantibodies against p 63 and p 73 in what could be a subgroup of OLP patients. OLP could thus be suggested to be not one distinct disease, but based on our data a disease comprising different subgroups...|$|E
