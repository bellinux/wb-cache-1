5|$|Double Fine {{demonstrated}} an in-progress {{version of the}} remastered game at the 2014 IndieCade event in October 2014; new features included higher-resolution textures and improved resolution for the character models as well as having real-time lighting models, {{and the ability to}} switch back and forth between this presentation and the original graphics <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> control. The remastered game runs in 4:3 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch this to a 16:9 ratio rather than render in a native 16:9 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaff's patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank-like controls, including analogue controls for console versions and point-and-click controls for computer versions. The game's soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fine's Broken Age). The remastered version also includes developer commentary, which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game. The PlayStation version also features cloud saving between the PS4 and Vita versions.|$|E
25|$|With the V70 Bi-Fuel Volvo {{continued}} {{to offer a}} factory CNG powered car. A 95-litre tank installed in the trunk allowed for a claimed range of 250km running on CNG only. Due to the bulky tank rear cargo space was considerably reduced. Drivers could choose whether their car should run on petrol or CNG <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> button. On Bi-Fuel models the temperature gauge in the instrument cluster {{was replaced by a}} level gauge for the gas tank. Several options, such as a trip computer and sports suspension, were not available for Bi-Fuel models.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Tyco Toys created {{a line of}} action figures called The Incredible Crash Dummies based on the {{characters}} from the NHTSA television advertisements. They were intended to fall apart <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> button on their abdomens. Vehicles which could be crashed into walls and broken were also produced. Dummies and vehicles were easily reassembled. They prompted a one-hour television special, The Adventures of the Incredible Crash Dummies. Unique for its time, the cartoon was produced entirely using 3D computer animation techniques. A comic book series and a video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy were produced.|$|E

25|$|The {{advent of}} {{incandescent}} gas lighting in factories, homes {{and in the}} streets, replacing oil lamps and candles with steady clear light, almost matching daylight in its colour, turned night into day for many—making night shift work possible in industries where light was all important—in spinning, weaving and making up garments etc. The social significance of this change is difficult for generations brought up with lighting after dark available <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> switch to appreciate. Not only was industrial production accelerated, but streets were made safe, social intercourse facilitated and reading and writing made more widespread. Gas works were built in almost every town, main streets were brightly illuminated and gas was piped in the streets {{to the majority of}} urban households. The invention of the gas meter and the pre-payment meter in the late 1880s {{played an important role in}} selling town gas to domestic and commercial customers.|$|E
500|$|The GTS has usually used a more {{powerful}} engine and robust drivetrain than other HSV models, however the E-Series 1 GTS shared the 6.0L LS2 V8 engine with 412bhp (307kW) of power and 405lb·ft (550 N·m) of torque, with the cheaper Clubsport and the luxury Senator. The major difference between the E-Series GTS and other HSV models in the range is the Magnetic Ride Control (MRC, or [...] "MagneRide"). MRC utilises magnetorheological dampers to improve the car's handling and dynamics. In the GTS, the MRC can be switched between Performance and Track response modes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> button. MRC is not available on the Clubsport; it is standard equipment of the Senator, but switches between [...] "Luxury" [...] and [...] "Performance", there is no [...] "Track" [...] mode like the GTS has.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 March 2009, the [...] "Boost Specials" [...] pack was released. It {{featured}} two cars: the Carson Extreme Hotrod and the Montgomery Hawker Mech. The Carson {{was described}} as the fastest car {{in the game and}} featured a 'locked' boost; the car continues to boost until it is brought to a stop in any manner. The vehicle dynamics system were rewired so that the Carson performs more realistically than any other car in the game. The Montgomery Hawker Mech also featured a unique boost system, which allows the player to willingly switch between the three different boost types <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> button.|$|E

2500|$|The {{later years}} of this {{generation}} of Toronado saw new features mostly confined to minor styling tweaks to the grille and trim, although in 1977, the XS and XSR models debuted. Both featured a three-sided, hot wire [...] "bent-glass" [...] rear window and, on the XSR, electric t-tops which slid inwards <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> button. However, as built in prototype form, the XSR had no means of channeling water away from the retractable sections, and water would inevitably leak into the cabin. No workable {{solution to the problem}} was found, and as such, the XSR model was scrapped. The XS, which did enter production, was offered with GM's more reliable (and no doubt more leak-resistant) Astroroof sliding sunroof instead. Air conditioning was standard.|$|E
2500|$|To set {{the scene}} for the album's release Virgin {{released}} one of the album tracks immediately {{in advance of the}} album. [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] went to number six in the UK singles chart, confirming the band's popularity. Virgin began heavily advertising the release of the new album, set for the end of October 1981. [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] was accompanied by a futuristic looking promotional video, a rarity at the time. Whilst it was still in the charts, Dare premiered to critical acclaim. It was also condemned by the Musicians' Union, who believed the new technology employed by the Human League was making traditional musicians redundant and a threat to their monopoly. Soon they would begin a [...] "Keep It Live" [...] campaign believing that bands like the Human League would be able to perform concerts <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> button.|$|E

50|$|He {{was known}} to go into trance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> money too. Reportedly, his hand would twitch and he would feel excruciating pain. Once the coin is removed, {{he would return to}} normalcy.|$|R
6000|$|MRS GEORGE [with sudden {{depth of}} feeling] Oh, {{if you could}} restore to this wasted {{exhausted}} heart one ray of the passion that once welled up at the glance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lover! It's you who would scream then, young man. Do you see this face, once fresh and rosy like your own, now scarred and riven by a hundred burnt-out fires? ...|$|E
6000|$|The boy {{was slowly}} {{following}} his mother, {{with his head}} fallen. March overtook him, and he started nervously <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hand on his shoulder, and then looked gratefully up into the man's face. March tried {{to tell him what}} the crime of lese-majesty was, and he said: [...] "Oh, yes. I understood that. But I got to thinking; and I don't want my mother to take any risks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} these {{fascinating}} little volumes will tell us. Kitty, read something to your suffering cousins about Donnacona,--he sounds uncommonly like an Irishman," [...] answered the colonel, establishing himself in an easy-chair; and Kitty picked up a small sketch {{of the history of}} Quebec, and, opening it, fell into the trance which came upon her <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> book, and read on for some pages to herself.|$|E
60|$|MARY. O, yes! {{his mind}} is wellnigh gone. He will sit for hours as you see him, and never speak nor stir but <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> Will's hand or the sound of Will's name.|$|R
60|$|She leaned {{a little}} further across the table. Again her eyes held mine, and I felt my heart beat like a boy's <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> her soft white fingers as she laid her hand on mine.|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him a little. [...] "What woman was EVER safe? She told me," [...] she added--and {{it was as if}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> connexion--"of your {{extraordinary}} meeting in the country. After that a quoi se fier?" ...|$|R
60|$|One is {{reminded}} of those houses {{into which the}} white ants have eaten their way; outwardly still fair and solid, they crumble <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hand. And now you will begin to understand those changes of bearing that so perplexed Lady Harman, that sudden insurgence of flushed half-furtive passion in the garden, through the thin pretences of a liberal friendship. His hollow honour had been gripped and had given way.|$|E
60|$|It is {{a picture}} {{beautiful}} as the opalescent colors of a soap bubble. It is {{the vision of a}} garden of Eden from which the demon has been banished. And the Demon in question is the Private Ownership of the Means of Production. His name is less romantic than those of the wonted demons of legend and folklore. But it is at least suitable for the matter-of-fact age of machinery which he is supposed to haunt and on which he casts his evil spell. Let him be once exorcised and the ills of humanity are gone. And the exorcism, it appears, is of the simplest. Let this demon once feel the contact of state ownership of the means of production and his baneful influence will vanish into thin air as his mediæval predecessors did <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thimbleful of holy water.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, my dear, both {{history and}} {{observation}} teach us that great gifts like yours partake {{of the character}} of an accident in a woman; they are not natural to her, and she does not wear such jewels easily --they put her outside of her sex. It is something as though a man were born into the world with wings. At first he would be very proud of them, and go sailing about in the sky to the admiration of the crowds beneath him; but by-and-by he would grow tired of flying alone, and after all, {{it is not necessary to}} fly to transact the ordinary business of the world. And perhaps at last he would learn to love somebody without wings, somebody who could not fly, and he would always want to be with her down on the homely earth, and not alone up in the heavenly heights. If a woman had all the genius of Plato or all the learning of Solomon, it would be forgotten <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> baby's fingers.|$|E

60|$|The cub snarled {{a little}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand, {{and the hand}} flew back to {{administer}} a clout. Whereupon the cub covered its fangs, and sank down submissively, while the hand, returning, rubbed behind his ears, {{and up and down}} his back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle," [...] said she, wincing {{a little}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> name, {{as a horse}} with a sore back winces <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saddle, [...] "it wasn't about the sheep that I was going to speak to you. I {{want you to do}} me a favour." ...|$|R
6000|$|If, however, your {{children}} are not average children, if you are so happy as to have begotten children of exceptional intelligence, {{it does not follow}} that this fact will save them from conclusions quite parallel to those of the common child. Suppose they do penetrate the pretence that there is no intrinsic difference between the Royal Family {{and the members of the}} peerage on the one hand, and the average person in any other class on the other; suppose they discover that the whole scale of precedence and honour in their land is a stupendous sham;-- what then? Suppose they see quite clearly that all these pretensions of an inviolate superiority of birth and breeding vanish <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Whitaker Wright, soften to a glowing cordiality before the sunny promises of a Hooley. Suppose they perceive that neither King nor lords really believe in their own lordliness, and that at any point in the system one may find men with hands for any man's tip, provided it is only sufficiently large! Even then!--How is that going to react upon our children's social conduct? ...|$|E
60|$|The army of Harar is not imposing. There {{are between}} forty and fifty matchlockmen of Arab origin, long {{settled in the}} place, and {{commanded}} by a veteran Maghrebi. They receive for pay one dollar's worth of holcus per annum, a quantity sufficient to afford five or six loaves a day: the luxuries of life must be provided by the exercise of some peaceful craft. Including slaves, the total of armed men may be two hundred: of these one carries a Somali or Galla spear, another a dagger, and a third a sword, which is generally the old German cavalry blade. Cannon of small calibre {{is supposed to be}} concealed in the palace, but none probably knows their use. The city may contain thirty horses, of which a dozen are royal property: they are miserable ponies, but well trained to the rocks and hills. The Galla Bedouins would oppose an invader with a strong force of spearmen, the approaches to the city are difficult and dangerous, but it is commanded from the north and west, and the walls would crumble <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> six-pounder. Three hundred Arabs and two gallopper guns would take Harar in an hour.|$|E
60|$|To assure himself {{beyond a}} doubt before {{going back to}} report upon so {{important}} a matter, Searing pushed forward across the line of abandoned pits, running from cover to cover in the more open forest, his eyes vigilant to discover possible stragglers. He came {{to the edge of}} a plantation--one of those forlorn, deserted homesteads of the last years of the war, upgrown with brambles, ugly with broken fences and desolate with vacant buildings having blank apertures in place of doors and windows. After a keen reconnoissance from the safe seclusion of a clump of young pines Searing ran lightly across a field and through an orchard to a small structure which stood apart from the other farm buildings, on a slight elevation. This he thought would enable him to overlook a large scope of country in the direction that he supposed the enemy to have taken in withdrawing. This building, which had originally consisted of a single room elevated upon four posts about ten feet high, was now little more than a roof; the floor had fallen away, the joists and planks loosely piled on the ground below or resting on end at various angles, not wholly torn from their fastenings above. The supporting posts were themselves no longer vertical. It looked as if the whole edifice would go down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finger.|$|E

"A pale sun {{broke from}} the driving cloud, [...] And {{flashed in the}} raindrops serenely cool: [...] <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> his finger <b>the</b> forest bowed, [...] As it shimmered and glanced in the ruffled pool, [...] While the {{rustling}} leaves soughed soft and low. [...] Gracioso! ...|$|R
