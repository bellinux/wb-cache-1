40|$|AbstractIt {{was shown}} by S. N. Bernstein that if f is an entire {{function}} <b>of</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>type</b> τ such that |f(x) |⩽M for −∞<x<∞, then |f′(x) |⩽Mτ for −∞<x<∞. If p is a polynomial of degree at most n with |p(z) |⩽M for |z|= 1, then f(z) :=p(eiz) is an entire function <b>of</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>type</b> n with |f(x) |⩽M {{on the real}} axis. Hence, by the just mentioned inequality for functions <b>of</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>type,</b> |p′(z) |⩽Mn for |z|= 1. Lately, many papers have been written on polynomials p that satisfy the condition znp(1 /z) ≡p(z). They do form an intriguing class. If a polynomial p satisfies this condition, then f(z) :=p(eiz) is an entire function <b>of</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>type</b> n that satisfies the condition f(z) ≡einzf(−z). This led Govil [N. K. Govil, Lp inequalities for entire functions <b>of</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>type,</b> Math. Inequal. Appl. 6 (2003) 445 – 452] to consider entire functions f <b>of</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>type</b> satisfying f(z) ≡eiτzf(−z) and find estimates for their derivatives.
