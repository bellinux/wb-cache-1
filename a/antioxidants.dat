5|$|<b>Antioxidants</b> are {{classified}} into two broad divisions, {{depending on whether}} they are soluble in water (hydrophilic) or in lipids (lipophilic). In general, water-soluble <b>antioxidants</b> react with oxidants in the cell cytosol and the blood plasma, while lipid-soluble <b>antioxidants</b> protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidation. These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet. The different <b>antioxidants</b> are present at {{a wide range of}} concentrations in body fluids and tissues, with some such as glutathione or ubiquinone mostly present within cells, while others such as uric acid are more evenly distributed (see table below). Some <b>antioxidants</b> are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in pathogens and can be virulence factors.|$|E
5|$|<b>Antioxidants</b> are {{frequently}} added to industrial products. A common use is as stabilizers in fuels and lubricants to prevent oxidation, and in gasolines {{to prevent the}} polymerization {{that leads to the}} formation of engine-fouling residues. In 2014, the worldwide market for natural and synthetic <b>antioxidants</b> was US $2.25 billion with a forecast of growth to $3.25 billion by 2020.|$|E
5|$|<b>Antioxidants</b> {{are used}} as food {{additives}} to help guard against food deterioration. Exposure to oxygen and sunlight are the two main factors in the oxidation of food, so food is preserved by keeping {{in the dark and}} sealing it in containers or even coating it in wax, as with cucumbers. However, as oxygen is also important for plant respiration, storing plant materials in anaerobic conditions produces unpleasant flavors and unappealing colors. Consequently, packaging of fresh fruits and vegetables contains an ~8% oxygen atmosphere. <b>Antioxidants</b> are an especially important class of preservatives as, unlike bacterial or fungal spoilage, oxidation reactions still occur relatively rapidly in frozen or refrigerated food. These preservatives include natural <b>antioxidants</b> such as ascorbic acid (AA, E300) and tocopherols (E306), as well as synthetic <b>antioxidants</b> such as propyl gallate (PG, E310), tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA, E320) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, E321).|$|E

40|$|The <b>antioxidant</b> {{potential}} of 42 melon (Cucumis melo) lines including six cultivars grown in Turkey {{was assessed by}} measuring total water-soluble <b>antioxidant</b> capacity, phenolic and vitamin C contents. The lines showed significant variability for all three <b>antioxidant</b> parameters with breeding lines having higher <b>antioxidant</b> capacity and phenolic content than some popular cultivars. Different types of melons also showed significantly different <b>antioxidant</b> potentials. Thus, galia and ananas types showed a higher mean <b>antioxidant</b> capacity and phenolic content than the other tested types (yuva, kislik, canary, and charentais).

40|$|In {{order to}} supply new {{information}} on the <b>antioxidant</b> function of selected beverages for nutritionists and the general public, total phenolic contents of 51 kinds of herbal and tea infusions made in China were measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu method, and their <b>antioxidant</b> capacities were evaluated using ferric reducing <b>antioxidant</b> power (FRAP) and Trolox equivalent <b>antioxidant</b> capacity (TEAC) assays. A significant correlation between FRAP and TEAC values suggested that <b>antioxidant</b> components in these beverages were capable of reducing oxidants and scavenging free radicals. The high correlation between <b>antioxidant</b> capacities and total phenolic contents indicated that phenolic compounds {{could be one of}} the main components responsible for <b>antioxidant</b> activities of these beverages. Generally, these beverages had high <b>antioxidant</b> capacities and total phenolic contents, and could be important dietary sources of <b>antioxidant</b> phenolics for prevention of diseases caused by oxidative stress...|$|R
5|$|Early {{research}} {{on the role of}} <b>antioxidants</b> in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fats, which is the cause of rancidity. Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was the identification of vitamins A, C, and E as <b>antioxidants</b> that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of <b>antioxidants</b> in the biochemistry of living organisms. The possible mechanisms of action of <b>antioxidants</b> were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized. Research into how vitamin E prevents the process of lipid peroxidation led to the identification of <b>antioxidants</b> as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by scavenging reactive oxygen species before they can damage cells.|$|E
5|$|Nonpolar <b>antioxidants</b> such as eugenol—a major {{component}} of oil of cloves—have toxicity limits that can be exceeded with the misuse of undiluted essential oils. Toxicity associated with high doses of water-soluble <b>antioxidants</b> such as ascorbic acid are less of a concern, as these compounds can be excreted rapidly in urine. More seriously, very high doses of some <b>antioxidants</b> may have harmful long-term effects. The beta-carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) study of lung cancer patients found that smokers given supplements containing beta-carotene and vitamin A had increased rates of lung cancer. Subsequent studies confirmed these adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|Although dietary <b>antioxidants</b> {{have been}} {{investigated}} for potential effects on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, these studies have been inconclusive.|$|E
30|$|Interestingly, in our results, {{a similar}} trend {{was also found}} for TEAC and SOD-like <b>antioxidant</b> activities. Using TEAC method, the <b>antioxidant</b> {{activity}} TEAC value of UFT was 1.35 [*]±[*] 0.15 mM/g DW TE and it decreased to 0.95 [*]±[*] 0.07 and 0.52 [*]±[*] 0.15 mM/g DW TE for PFT and FFT, respectively (Table  3). In case of SOD-like <b>antioxidant</b> activity, similar finding to DPPH and TEAC was also observed. The gradual lessening of percentage <b>antioxidant</b> activity was demonstrated by using this SOD-like <b>antioxidant</b> activity assay. These decreases in <b>antioxidant</b> activities during tea fermentation could be associated with reduced of <b>antioxidant</b> components in IOSC (Table  3).|$|R
40|$|<b>Antioxidant</b> {{activity}} of various ginger extracts are different. The aims {{of this work}} are to determine the <b>antioxidant</b> {{activity of}} ginger extracts on linoleic acid. The <b>antioxidant</b> activities were tested on linoleic acid supplemented with water and dichloromethane extract of ginger. The <b>antioxidant</b> activity was tested by measuring malonaldehide absorbance. Total phenol and iron content of the extracts were analyzed by spectrometry. This research showed that <b>antioxidant</b> activity of water and dichloromethane extract of ginger was stronger than a-tocopherol, and <b>antioxidant</b> activity of dichloromethane extract is stronger than water extract of ginger. <b>Antioxidant</b> activity of ginger extracts, seems to be correlated with the total phenol and iron content...|$|R
50|$|A {{polyphenol}} <b>antioxidant</b> {{is a type}} of <b>antioxidant</b> {{containing a}} polyphenolic substructure. Numbering over 4,000 distinct species, many of these compounds have <b>antioxidant</b> activity in vitro but are unlikely to have <b>antioxidant</b> roles in vivo. Rather, they may affect cell-to-cell signaling, receptor sensitivity, inflammatory enzyme activity or gene regulation.|$|R
5|$|Cnidaria {{that carry}} {{photosynthetic}} symbionts {{may have the}} opposite problem, an excess of oxygen, which may prove toxic. The animals produce large quantities of <b>antioxidants</b> to neutralize the excess oxygen.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} α-tocopherol form is the most {{important}} lipid-soluble antioxidant, and that it protects membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction. This removes the free radical intermediates and prevents the propagation reaction from continuing. This reaction produces oxidised α-tocopheroxyl radicals that can be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other <b>antioxidants,</b> such as ascorbate, retinol or ubiquinol. This is in line with findings showing that α-tocopherol, but not water-soluble <b>antioxidants,</b> efficiently protects glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)-deficient cells from cell death. GPx4 is the only known enzyme that efficiently reduces lipid-hydroperoxides within biological membranes.|$|E
30|$|Numerous {{methods are}} {{available}} to evaluate of <b>antioxidant</b> activity. For in vitro <b>antioxidant</b> screening, DPPH, ABTS, hydroxyl radical scavenging, hydrogen peroxide scavenging activities and ferric reducing power are most commonly used. However, the total <b>antioxidant</b> activity of an <b>antioxidant</b> cannot be evaluated by using one single method, due to oxidative processes. Therefore, at least two methods should be employed in order to evaluate the total <b>antioxidant</b> activity (Gulcin et al.|$|R
40|$|Ethnobotanical {{evidence}} suggests that herbs such as brahmi (Bacopa monnieri) and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) may possess <b>antioxidant</b> and neuroprotective properties. We compared the <b>antioxidant</b> and neuroprotective effects of supercritical extract of Bacopa monnieri and rosemary <b>antioxidant</b> extract obtained from Rosmarinus officinalis {{as well as their}} combination to examine the effects on human glial (U- 87 MG) and embryonic mouse hypothalamus cells. Bacopa monnieri extract, rosemary <b>antioxidant</b> extract, and their combination (1 : 1) are not cytotoxic in both glial and embryonic mouse hypothalamus cell lines up to 200 mg/mL concentration. The combination of extracts of Bacopa monnieri þ rosemary <b>antioxidant</b> has better <b>antioxidant</b> poten-tial and antilipid peroxidation activity than either agent alone. Although the extract of Bacopa monnieri þ rosemary <b>antioxidant</b> showed almost similar inhibition of phospho tau expression as Bacopa monnieri or rosemary <b>antioxidant</b> extract alone, the com-bination has better inhibitory effect on amyloid precursor protein synthesis and higher brain-derived neurotrophic factor produc-tion in hypothalamus cells than single agents.

40|$|Extracts of 42 {{medicinal}} plants {{used for the}} treatment of anaemia, diabetes, AIDS, malaria and obesity were screened for phytochemical substances and <b>antioxidant</b> potentials. The plant extracts were prepared as hydrolysed (for total <b>antioxidant)</b> and non-hydrolysed (for free <b>antioxidant).</b> Extracts were analysed using three different assay methods for <b>antioxidant</b> analysis: Folin (Folin Ciocalteu reagent), FRAP (Ferric Reducing <b>Antioxidant</b> Power) and DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl). The leaves of Alchornea cordifolia showed the highest <b>antioxidant</b> properties as determined by both Folin and FRAP free <b>antioxidant,</b> followed by Dacryodes edulis and Ocimum basilicum in FRAP and by Dacryodes edulis, Harungana madagascariensis for Folin and DPPH method.

5|$|Melatonin is a {{powerful}} antioxidant. Melatonin easily crosses cell membranes and the blood–brain barrier. Unlike other <b>antioxidants,</b> melatonin does not undergo redox cycling, which {{is the ability of}} a molecule to undergo repeated reduction and oxidation. Redox cycling may allow other <b>antioxidants</b> (such as vitamin C) to act as pro-oxidants and promote free radical formation. Melatonin, once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. Therefore, it has been referred to as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, the {{designed}} antioxidant NXY-059 exhibited efficacy {{in animal}} models, {{but failed to}} improve stroke outcomes in a clinical trial. As of November 2014, other <b>antioxidants</b> are being studied as potential neuroprotectants.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} importance and interactions between these different <b>antioxidants</b> {{is a very}} complex question, with the various metabolites and enzyme systems having synergistic and interdependent effects on one another. The action of one antioxidant may therefore depend on the proper function of other members of the antioxidant system.

5|$|While {{antioxidant}} supplementation {{is widely}} used in attempts to prevent the development of cancer, <b>antioxidants</b> may interfere with cancer treatments, since the environment of cancer cells causes high levels of oxidative stress, making these cells more susceptible to the further oxidative stress induced by treatments. As a result, by reducing the redox stress in cancer cells, antioxidant supplements (and pharmaceuticals) could decrease the effectiveness of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. On the other hand, other reviews have suggested that <b>antioxidants</b> could reduce side effects or increase survival times.|$|E
