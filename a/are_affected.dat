5|$|MS is not {{considered}} a hereditary disease; however, a number of genetic variations {{have been shown to}} increase the risk. Some of these genes appear to have higher levels of expression in microglial cells than expected by chance. The probability of developing the disease is higher in relatives of an affected person, with a greater risk among those more closely related. In identical twins both <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> about 30% of the time, while around 5% for non-identical twins and 2.5% of siblings <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> with a lower percentage of half-siblings. If both parents <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> the risk in their children is 10 times that of the general population. MS is also more common in some ethnic groups than others.|$|E

5|$|The breed {{is prone}} to skin disorders. About a quarter of Westies {{surveyed}} <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> by atopic dermatitis, a heritable chronic allergic skin condition. A higher proportion of males <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> compared to females. An uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition, hyperplastic dermatosis, may affect West Highland White Terriers, both juveniles and adults dogs. Affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and hair loss. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as allergies or less serious forms of dermatitis.|$|E
5|$|This {{species has}} bred in Iceland since about 1999, and was {{widespread}} by 2004, although numbers <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> by hard winters. Breeds occurs intermittently in the Faroes. The goldcrest has occurred as a vagrant in Jordan and Morocco.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax (PSP) tends {{to occur in}} a young adult without underlying lung problems, and usually causes limited symptoms. Chest pain and sometimes mild breathlessness are the usual predominant presenting features. People who <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> by PSPs are often unaware of potential danger and may wait several days before seeking medical attention. PSPs more commonly occur during changes in atmospheric pressure, explaining to some extent why episodes of pneumothorax may happen in clusters. It is rare for PSPs to cause tension pneumothoraces.|$|E

5|$|About 20% <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> by {{symptomatic}} {{digestive tract}} lesions, although {{a higher percentage}} have lesions that do not cause symptoms. These lesions may bleed intermittently, which is rarely significant enough to be noticed (in the form of bloody vomiting or black stool), but can eventually lead to depletion of iron in the body, resulting in iron-deficiency anemia.|$|E
5|$|All {{observation}} involves both {{perception and}} cognition. That is, {{one does not}} make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> by one's underlying understanding {{of the way in}} which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.|$|E
5|$|Although data on Russulaceae {{themselves}} are scarce, more {{is known about}} the habitats they occur in, especially for the ectomycorrhizal species which depend on their host plants: Several of these habitats <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> by loss or degradation, such as peatlands, Mediterranean forests and scrub or tropical African dry woodland. Similarly, dead wood, the habitat of the corticioid Russulaceae, is rare in many exploited forests and needs special management.|$|E

50|$|Each {{child of}} a mother {{affected}} with an X-linked dominant trait has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation and thus being affected with the disorder. If only the father <b>is</b> <b>affected,</b> 100% of the daughters will <b>be</b> <b>affected,</b> since they inherit their father's X-chromosome, and 0% of the sons will <b>be</b> <b>affected,</b> since they inherit their father's Y-chromosome.|$|R
5|$|Although not {{immediately}} threatened, crested and marbled newts suffer from population declines, caused mainly by habitat loss and fragmentation. Both their aquatic breeding sites and the cover-rich, natural landscapes upon which they depend during their terrestrial phase <b>are</b> <b>affected.</b> All species are legally protected in Europe, {{and some of}} their habitats have been designated as special reserves.|$|E
5|$|At {{each level}} of the spinal column, spinal nerves branch off from {{either side of the}} spinal cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to {{innervate}} a specific part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome, and the group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a myotome. The part of the spinal cord that was damaged corresponds to the spinal nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person's level of injury is defined as the lowest level of full sensation and function. Paraplegia occurs when the legs <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> by the spinal cord damage (in thoracic, lumbar, or sacral injuries), and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> (cervical damage).|$|E
5|$|Croup affects about 15% of children, {{and usually}} {{presents}} {{between the ages}} of 6 months and 5–6 years. It accounts for about 5% of hospital admissions in this population. In rare cases, it may occur in children as young as 3 months and as old as 15 years. Males <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> 50% more frequently than are females, and there is an increased prevalence in autumn.|$|E

However, the killing is indiscriminate and other constantly dividing cells and their organs <b>are</b> <b>affected,</b> which causes toxic side effects.

Most standard varieties <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> by the Great Vowel Shift, which changed the pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift and Canadian Shift have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.|$|E
5|$|Even mild or {{subclinical}} hypothyroidism {{leads to}} possible infertility and {{increased risk of}} miscarriage.

Women <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> by hypothyroidism in 0.3–0.5% of pregnancies.
