25|$|On {{a mission}} to rescue half-bloods Bianca and Nico di Angelo; Percy, Annabeth, Thalia and Grover are {{attacked}} by a manticore and rescued by the goddess Artemis and her Hunters. However, Annabeth falls off a cliff whilst trying to fight the manticore and {{is said to be}} captured. Later, Artemis is captured by Luke's army while on the hunt for the Ophiotaurus, a cow-serpent monster that was foretold to bring the downfall of Olympus when its entrails are sacrificed to a fire. Her lieutenant Zoe Nightshade, daughter of Atlas, leads Bianca, Thalia and Grover on a quest to save her. Percy, who was not invited to join the party, follows them on behalf of Nico Di Angelo, promising that he will do his best to protect his sister, Bianca. The others eventually find Percy, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>joins</b> their group. They become the prey of skeletons, who chase them across the country. Bianca is able to kill one, which leaves the others mystified. Bianca later dies as they make their way across a godly junkyard. They find Annabeth with Luke and Artemis, who is holding up the sky. Percy then takes it from Artemis and they trick Atlas into his original position under the sky. Thalia replaces Zoe, who dies, as Artemis' lieutenant. Thalia's induction as a lieutenant of Artemis ensures that she will become immortal, never aging to 16, thus escaping the Great Prophecy and leaving Percy to fulfill it. They return to camp and Percy informs Nico about Bianca's death during the journey. Nico blames Percy for failing to protect her and runs away, only after killing skeletons that invade the camp, so that Percy realizes that Hades is Nico's father.|$|E
500|$|Initially defiant, Christof {{agrees to}} {{accompany}} Ecaterina's servant Wilhem {{on a mission}} to master his new vampiric abilities.

Wilhem and Christof gain the favor of the local Jews and Cappadocians, who devote their member Serena to the Brujah cause. The Ventrue prince Brandl tells the group that in Vienna, the Tremere are abducting humans to turn them into ghouls—servitors addicted and empowered by Vampire blood.

2500|$|Roberto F. Canuto {{was born}} in Asturias, Spain. Since an early age he was curious for moviemaking. He remembered to watch The Jungle Book at a movie theatre {{when he was only}} 5 and {{question}} his family about the process of making a movie. During his childhood he starts music studies and obtains degrees in Piano, Harmony and other relates subjects at the [...] "Royal Conservatory of Music of Asturias" [...] (Spain) <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>joins</b> a short curse on acting at the [...] "Superior Dramatic Art School of Asturias" [...] in 1989. It is during these years when he discovers independent films from US and authors from Europe and, according to the director: [...] "that was probably the moment when I decided that my dream was to follow my storytelling passion".|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the Middle Ages, the Thebaid {{remained}} a popular text, inspiring a 12th-century French romance and works by Boccaccio and Chaucer. Statius' development of allegory helped establish {{the importance of}} that technique in Medieval poetry. In the Renaissance, the Silvae, thanks to Poliziano, helped inspire an entire genre of collections of miscellaneous, occasional poetry called Sylvae which remained popular throughout the period, inspiring works by Hugo Grotius and John Dryden. Dante mentions Statius in De vulgari eloquentia along with Ovid, Virgil, and Lucan {{as one of the}} four regulati poetae (ii, vi, 7). In Divina Commedia, Dante and Virgil are caught up with Statius as they leave the Fifth Terrace (reserved for the avaricious and the prodigal) and enter the Sixth (reserved for the gluttonous). Statius' redemption is heard in Canto XX (the mountain trembles and the penitent souls cry out [...] "Gloria in excelsis Deo") <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>joins</b> Dante and Virgil in Canto XXI. He then ascends Mount Purgatory with them and stays with Dante in the Earthly Paradise at the mountain's summit, after Virgil has returned to Limbo. He is last mentioned in Canto XXXIII, making him one of the longest recurring characters in the comedy, fourth to Dante, Virgil and Beatrice. He is not mentioned in Paradise, though he presumably ascends like Dante. Dante appears to claim that Statius was a secret convert to Christianity {{as a result of his}} reading of Virgil, although his conversion is not attested in any historical source. [...] A 2012 study dedicated to Dante's writing of Statius's relation to Christianity has shown the significance of the fact that Dante does not state that Statius ever converted to Christianity, but that his Neapolitan predecessor let himself be [...] "baptized" [...] by Christians.|$|E

60|$|So it goes on. At length {{the great}} {{audience}} rises {{and begins to}} depart, filing one by one through a certain doorway.

For the moment solitude is dreadful to me, and yet I cannot go into society; I shrink from persons who are mere acquaintances. At Sir James's suggestion, however, one visitor at the hotel {{has been asked to}} dine with us, who claims distinction as no ordinary guest. The physician who first warned me of the critical state of my mother's health is anxious to hear what I can tell him of her last moments. His time is too precious to be wasted in the earlier hours of the day, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>joins</b> us at the dinner-table when his patients leave him free to visit his friends.|$|E
