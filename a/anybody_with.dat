A Crosstalk episode broadcast the previous July, contained a debate about the NATO 2016 Warsaw summit in which {{all members of the}} panel expressed critical views. RT's representatives again stated that they couldn't find <b>anybody</b> <b>with</b> alternative opinions willing to take part, and that captions with pro-NATO comments should have been added before broadcast, but the wrong text was accidentally used.|$|E
500|$|The bleakness of the {{painting}} is informed by the artist's harsh nihilism and existentialist view of life. Bacon was Catholic, but according to his friend and biographer Michael Peppiatt, when he found {{he could no longer}} believe he was [...] "extremely disappointed and furious, and <b>anybody</b> <b>with</b> a scrap of religious belief... he would go for them". [...] Peppiatt makes the observation of Bacon that [...] "if somebody has that intensity, its almost a faith in and of itself".|$|E
500|$|Margaret Wappler from Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} [...] "Beautiful People" [...] sounds {{almost like a}} Kylie Minogue song [...] "with its powdered-sugar synths and dance floor positivity". Jon Caramanica from The New York Times wrote that the song [...] "has the clanging, {{swelling}} synths that are the hallmark of megaclubs." [...] Editors from Idolator wrote [...] "We like the song, though we don't see anything inherently 'Chris Brown' about this track — it really could have been recorded by <b>anybody</b> <b>with</b> similar results." [...] Ed Easton Jr. from WNOW-FM wrote that the song [...] "is a softer and sensitive side of Chris Brown as its lyrics {{are supposed to be}} meant to inspire others." [...] Joanne Dorken from MTV UK wrote that [...] "Brown's vocals are unrecognisable on this Ibiza-dance scene floor filler, which you can’t help but move to." [...] James Montgomery from MTV News praised Benassi's production skills, and wrote [...] "It's not a stretch to call 'Beautiful People' not only one of the year's most unexpected singles, but also one of the best." [...] Robert Copsey from Digital Spy awarded [...] "Beautiful People" [...] five out of five stars, and called it a [...] "dancehall thumper about equality and believing in yourself." ...|$|E

500|$|Guitar Hero III Mobile {{was well}} {{received}} upon its release. IGN considered {{it to be}} a [...] "successful adaptation" [...] of the Guitar Hero games to the cellphone keypad. They commented that while it may be tricky to download the songs for the game, requiring the user to be persistent during the download, the sound quality was excellent and the simplification down to three buttons from five makes the game [...] "accessible to <b>anybody</b> <b>with</b> even a passing curiosity." [...] CNET praised the quality of the sound and animations, as well as the ease of play. Cell Play referred to the game as [...] "the true mobile port of rock," [...] and praised the level of difficulty accomplished with the three button setup. They considered the shortened song length a negligible downside compared to the overall package. 1UPs review criticized the compact layout that led to hand cramps, and that the limited space on the mobile version only allowed two songs to be stored at a time. 1UP also lamented the shorted versions of the songs given the outstanding audio quality achieved on the mobile platform; their review summarized their experience as [...] "As a literal interpretation of the Guitar Hero formula, there was apparently no room to alter the game to emphasize the strengths of the mobile platform." [...] Guitar Hero III Mobile won two awards at the Qualcomm 2008 BREW Developers Conference for [...] "Best Game" [...] and [...] "People's Choice Award". The game has been downloaded by users 2.5 million times, with both Verizon and Hands-On Mobile claiming that over 250,000 songs are played a day on the platform.|$|E

In 2012, the US-based group Defense Distributed disclosed plans to design a working plastic 3D printed firearm [...] "that could be downloaded and reproduced by <b>anybody</b> <b>with</b> a 3D printer."

2500|$|The {{magazine}} proper {{began when}} Usborne learned {{of a new}} printing process, photo-litho offset, which meant that <b>anybody</b> <b>with</b> a typewriter and Letraset could produce a magazine. The publication was initially funded by Osmond and launched in 1961. It was named when Osmond looked for ideas in the well-known recruiting poster of Lord Kitchener (an image of Kitchener pointing with the caption [...] "Wants You") and, in particular, the pointing finger. After the name Finger was rejected, Osmond suggested Private Eye, {{in the sense of}} someone who [...] "fingers" [...] a suspect.|$|E
2500|$|In 1558 the Transylvanian Diet of Turda {{declared}} free {{practice of}} both the Catholic and Lutheran religions, but prohibited Calvinism. In 1568, the Diet extended this freedom, declaring that, [...] "It {{is not allowed to}} anybody to intimidate <b>anybody</b> <b>with</b> captivity or expulsion for his religion". Four religions were declared as accepted (recepta), while Orthodox Christianity was [...] "tolerated" [...] (though the building of stone Orthodox churches was forbidden). When Hungary entered the Thirty Years' War of 1618–48, Royal (Habsburg) Hungary joined the Catholic side, then Transylvania joined the Protestant side.|$|E

2500|$|William Mason, {{another one}} of Harlow's {{students}} who continued conducting deprivation experiments after leaving Wisconsin, has said that Harlow [...] "kept this going {{to the point where}} it was clear to many people that the work was really violating ordinary sensibilities, that <b>anybody</b> <b>with</b> respect for life or people would find this offensive.

2500|$|The {{distributed}} computing project LHC@home was started {{to support the}} construction and calibration of the LHC. The project uses the BOINC platform, enabling <b>anybody</b> <b>with</b> an Internet connection and a computer running Mac OS X, Windows or Linux, to use their computer's idle time to simulate how particles will travel in the beam pipes. With this information, the scientists are able {{to determine how the}} magnets should be calibrated to gain the most stable [...] "orbit" [...] of the beams in the ring. In August 2011, a second application went live (Test4Theory) which performs simulations against which to compare actual test data, to determine confidence levels of the results.|$|E
2500|$|The {{minority}} {{found that}} even if [...] "living together" [...] {{should be considered a}} legitimate aim within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Articles 8 and 9, the ban was still disproportionate. Because very few women wear full-face veil, [...] most people would seldom or never meet <b>anybody</b> <b>with</b> the veil even without a ban. For those few who uses the veil, the consequences of a ban {{was on the other side}} large, as they might have to choose between being confined to their home or violating their own religious convictions or cultural practice. The minority said that even if the fine was small, women who used veils would risk multiple fines, and the cumulative effect for the woman had to be considered.|$|E

2500|$|Streaming {{media is}} the {{real-time}} delivery of digital media {{for the immediate}} consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet [...] "broadcasters" [...] who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, {{can be used to}} access on-line media {{in much the same way}} as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical webcasts to on-demand popular multimedia services. Podcasting is a variation on this theme, where– usually audio– material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a portable media player to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow <b>anybody,</b> <b>with</b> little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|The suspect {{apparently}} posted {{messages from}} his mobile phone to a website [...] "Extreme Exchange, Revised", revealing his intentions through his final message via his mobile phone 20 {{minutes before the}} attack. A police official stated the first message read, [...] "I will kill people in Akihabara." [...] Other messages he {{is alleged to have}} posted include, [...] "If only I had a girlfriend, I wouldn't have quit work," [...] "I would never have become addicted to my mobile phone. <b>Anybody</b> <b>with</b> hope couldn't possibly understand how I feel," [...] and [...] "I don't have a single friend and I won't in the future. I'll be ignored because I'm ugly. I'm lower than trash because at least the trash gets recycled." [...] It also referred to [...] "a stabbing spree in Tsuchiura". Commentators referred to the incident, based on the messages, as another case of the phenomenon of Hikikomori or Internet suicide. Later messages revealed his plan to use a vehicle until it became inoperable, and then to use a knife to continue the attack on foot. He waited for Chūō-dōri to close at noon to vehicular traffic before commencing the attack.|$|E
2500|$|A {{short time}} later, both Mark and Roger are {{simultaneously}} reaching an artistic epiphany, as Roger finds his song in Mimi and Mark finds his film in Angel's memory. Roger returns to New York {{just in time}} for Christmas, and Mark quits his job to work on his own film once more ("What You Own"). The characters' parents leave several worried messages on their phones ("Voice Mail #5"), and on Christmas Eve, exactly one year having passed, Mark prepares to screen his now-completed film to his friends. Roger has written his song, but no one can find Mimi for him to play it to. Benny's wife, discovering Benny's relationship with Mimi, has pulled Benny out of the East Village. The power suddenly blows and Collins enters with handfuls of cash, revealing that he reprogrammed an ATM at a grocery store to provide money to <b>anybody</b> <b>with</b> the code (A-N-G-E-L). Maureen and Joanne abruptly enter carrying Mimi, who has been homeless and is now weak and close to death. She begins to fade, but not before telling Roger that she loves him ("Finale"). Roger tells her to hold on as he plays her the song he wrote for her, which reveals the depths of his feelings for her ("Your Eyes"). Mimi appears to die, but abruptly awakens, claiming to have been heading into a white light, except that a vision of Angel told her to go back. The remaining friends gather together in a final moment of shared happiness and resolve to enjoy whatever time they have left with each other, affirming that there is [...] "no day but today" [...] ("Finale B").|$|E

2500|$|In Germany itself, the Ahnenpass and Nuremberg Laws {{classified}} {{people as}} {{being of the}} Jewish race if they descended from three or four grandparents enrolled in Jewish congregations. A person {{with one or two}} grandparents enrolled in a Jewish congregation could be classified as Mischling, a crossbreed, of [...] "mixed blood", if they were not a member of a Jewish congregation at the time the Nuremberg Laws were enacted. Only people with at least two of their grandparents of [...] "German blood" [...] could be German Reich's citizens, other Germans dropped into the new second class group of citizens, the so-called state citizens. If a person, with grandparents of the same religious combination, was enrolled {{as a member of a}} Jewish congregation in 1935 or would join later, they switched from the discriminatory class of Mischlinge into that of Geltungsjude, [...] "Jew by legal validity", despite of not fulfilling the no less law-defined discriminating criterion of descending from three or four Jewish grandparents. Whereas every Mischling could anytime drop into the class of Geltungsjude by joining a Jewish congregation, the Nuremberg Laws provided for the unchanged classification of any Geltungsjude, regardless if she or he tried to evade harm by seceding from the Jewish congregation after 1935, considering such secessions as being of no effect as to the discrimination. Let alone people with three or four Jewish grandparents who themselves could never alter their law-defined racial categorisation as Jews. Any Mischling with two Jewish grandparents, colloquially called a half-Jew, marrying after 1935 anybody classified as Jew would drop into the discriminatory class of Geltungsjude. Mischlinge with one Jewish grandparent were usually forbidden to marry <b>anybody</b> <b>with</b> any Jewish grandparent. The Mischling Test was introduced to identify Europeans with Jewish blood and consider those tested [...] "Jews of the first or second degree." ...|$|E
