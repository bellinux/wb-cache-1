"Like {{meteorological}} or <b>atmospheric</b> <b>climate,</b> social {{climate is}} relatively distinctive across groups (as the Tropics {{differ from the}} Himalayas); is dynamic or changeable within groups (like the seasons); and can influence behavior (like an individual’s choice of clothing). Social climate research has grown considerably since White and Lippitt’s (1960) early experiments comparing democratic, autocratic, and laissez-faire leadership in small groups of children. The concept and measurement of social climate have since been applied across widely diverse disciplines {{both within and outside}} the field of psychology." ...|$|E

50|$|Warming or cooling of the {{equatorial}} oceans has understandable consequences for <b>atmospheric</b> <b>climate.</b> The equatorial oceans comprise {{a major portion}} of the overall heat budget and, therefore, alter convective regimes near the equator. In the case of the Pacific El Niño, enhanced convection over the central Pacific and reduced convection over the Maritime Continent fundamentally change climate not just in the tropics, but globally. Since the Atlantic Niño is physically similar to ENSO, we might expect climate impacts from it as well. However, given its reduced size both spatially (the Atlantic basin is much smaller than the Pacific basin) and in magnitude, the climate impacts of the Atlantic Niño are best seen in the tropical and subtropical regions nearest to {{the equatorial}} Atlantic.|$|E

5000|$|Seventy {{percent of}} the Earth is covered by water, so {{information}} about the marine environment is vital in understanding how the Earth's surface system works. Nick McCave's research looks at perturbations in the deep oceans, using evidence from micro-fossils combined with carbon dating, to obtain information on pre-historical climate change. It {{is important to understand}} the normal cycles of climate change, in order to assess {{the degree to which the}} global warming we are experiencing now is caused by man, and the likely consequences by analysis of past analogues. One problem is the interaction between <b>atmospheric</b> <b>climate</b> change and the observed changes in the ocean currents. There is a 'chicken and egg' question: are the perturbations seen in atmospheric CO2 concentrations forced by the vigour of the deep ocean currents, or vice versa? ...|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} heat content, {{it is the}} world ocean that dominates <b>atmospheric</b> <b>climate.</b> The oceans store more than 90% of the heat in Earth's climate system and act as a buffer against the effects of climate change. For instance, an average {{temperature}} increase of the entire world ocean by 0.01 °C may seem small, {{but in fact it}} represents a very large increase in heat content. If all the heat associated with this anomaly was instantaneously transferred to the entire global atmosphere it would increase the average temperature of the atmosphere by approximately 10 °C. Thus, a small change in the mean temperature of the ocean represents a very large change in the total heat content of the climate system. Of course, when the ocean gains heat (Figure 6), the water expands and this represents a component of global sea-level rise.|$|E
5000|$|The Atlantic Equatorial Mode or Atlantic Niño is a quasiperiodic interannual climate {{pattern of}} the {{equatorial}} Atlantic Ocean. It is the dominant mode of year-to-year variability that results in alternating warming and cooling episodes of sea surface temperatures accompanied by changes in atmospheric circulation. The term Atlantic Niño comes from its close similarity with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) that dominates the tropical Pacific basin. The Atlantic Niño {{is not the same}} as the Atlantic Meridional (Interhemispheric) Mode that consists of a north-south dipole and operates more on decadal timescales. [...] The equatorial warming and cooling events associated with the Atlantic Niño are known to be strongly related to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>climate</b> anomalies, especially in African countries bordering the Gulf of Guinea. Therefore, understanding of the Atlantic Niño (or lack thereof) has important implications for climate prediction in those regions. Although the Atlantic Niño is an intrinsic mode to the equatorial Atlantic, there may be a tenuous causal relationship between ENSO and the Atlantic Niño in some circumstances.|$|E

40|$|West Antarctic {{climate and}} surface mass balance (SMB) records are sparse. To fill this gap, {{regional}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>climate</b> modelling is useful, providing that such models are employed at sufficiently high horizontal resolution and {{coupled with a}} snow model. Here we present {{the results of a}} high-resolution (5. 5 km) regional <b>atmospheric</b> <b>climate</b> model (RACMO 2) simulation of coastal West Antarctica for the period 1979 – 2015. We evaluate the results with available in situ weather observations, remote-sensing estimates of surface melt, and SMB estimates derived from radar and firn cores. Moreover, results are compared with those from a lower-resolution version, to assess the added value of the resolution. The high-resolution model resolves small-scale climate variability invoked by topography, such as the relatively warm conditions over ice-shelf grounding zones, and local wind speed accelerations. Surface melt and SMB are well reproduced by RACMO 2. This dataset will prove useful for picking ice core locations, converting elevation changes to mass changes, for driving ocean, ice-sheet and coupled models, and for attributing changes in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and shelves to changes in atmospheric forcing...|$|E
40|$|Soil climate, {{the record}} of {{temporal}} patterns of soil moisture and temperature, {{is an important component}} of the structure of U. S. Soil Taxonomy. The U. S. Soil Survey has used the Newhall Simulation Model (NSM) for estimating soil climate from <b>atmospheric</b> <b>climate</b> records at weather stations since the 1970 s. The current soil climate map of the U. S. was published in 1994 by using NSM runs from selected weather stations along with knowledge-based hand-drawn mapping procedures. We developed a revised soil climate mapping methodology using the NSM and digital soil mapping techniques. ^ The new methodology is called Grid Element Newhall Simulation Model (GEN), where a coordinate system is used to divide geographic space into a grid and each element or grid-cell serves as a reference area for querying and organizing model input, and for organizing and displaying model output. The GEN was used to make a soil moisture map of the conterminous U. S. (GEN-CONUS). GEN-CONUS and the 1994 map were compared to each other and to two sets of weather station data from years 1961 to 1990 and years 1971 to 2000 (National climate data center, NCDC). Agreement between GEN-CONUS and the 1994 map was 75. 6 %. GEN-CONUS had higher agreement than the 1994 map with NSM output from NCDC data for 1961 - 1990 and 1971 - 2000 (kappa = 0. 845 and 0. 777). The GEN methodology was also used to generate a map of projected soil climate in the year 2080 for part of the Southern Rocky Mountains, predicting expansion of the Ustic and contraction of the Udic moisture regimes. ^ Soil climate in the conterminous US is expected to change in response to global climate change. Soil moisture and temperature are strongly influenced by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>climate</b> variables. The Grid Element Newhall Simulation Model (GEN), an updated NSM for geographic raster data, was developed and applied in this project to future climate simulations available from International <b>atmospheric</b> <b>climate</b> prediction projects. These included a simulation of 1) current climate conditions, 2) climate in year 2070 under a radiative forcing increase scenario of 2. 6 W m- 2 above pre-industrial levels (a low estimate) and 3) climate in the year 2070 under a radiative forcing scenario increase of 8. 5 W m- 2 (higher estimate). ^ As a driver of soil development and a key factor of soil formation, climate influences physical and chemical properties of soils as they form from geological and biological material. In this study we examine soil climate as simulated by the NSM and its relation to georeferenced point observations of soil properties measured and recorded over many decades by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The goal is to determine the strength and direction of relationships between geographic observations of soil properties that may have been influenced by climate and the simulations of soil climate for the same locations. An additional goal is to determine whether the NSM as a process model contributes substantially to an accounting of the interaction between <b>atmospheric</b> <b>climate</b> and any resulting soil properties, or whether a simpler observational model that does not include simulation of soil moisture and temperature interactions might be sufficient or superior to this simulation approach. The observational model includes the same input directly taken from <b>atmospheric</b> <b>climate</b> datasets as that used to populate the NSM, but does not include simulation of how the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>climate</b> would translate into soil climate through simulation of moisture and temperature dynamics in the soil. ^ We find that the NSM may have some value as a tool to explain a few relationships between climate and soil properties observed in the NCSS dataset, but that direct observation without simulation also shows promise. Severe limitations in the NCSS data include unknown sampling biases, ambiguous geographical precision of observation, inconsistent sampling and analysis protocols, incomplete data records, etc. Limitations of the usefulness of the NSM include high levels of multicollinearity among model output parameters, adherence to moisture modelling behavior that does not account for the complexities of preferential flow, the assumption of free-drainage in all soils modelled, the lack of a ponding routine or a realistic accounting of snow melt dynamics, as well as other limitations. These limitations may restrict the results of this study from providing firm conclusions, but exploratory analysis does indicate some positive correlations between <b>atmospheric</b> <b>climate</b> and soil properties, particularly after atmospheric datasets are applied to simulation of soil climate through the NSM.
