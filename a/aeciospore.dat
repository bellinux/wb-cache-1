5000|$|Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli is an obligate parasite, and as {{with most}} other rust fungi diseases, spruce broom rust {{requires}} two different host plants {{to carry out its}} life cycle and is therefore referred to as heteroecious. [...] The primary or aecial host of the rust is spruce (Picea spp.), and the secondary or telia host of the rust is bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi). The alternative bearberry host is necessary for <b>aeciospore</b> germination, and is therefore essential for the rust’s lifecycle. Spruce broom rust is a macrocyclic rust, meaning that the fungus produces more spore types in addition to teliospores and basidiospores. [...] In midsummer, aecia appear on the epidermis of spruce needles as orange pustules. [...] Eventually, these aecia rupture and release millions of microscopic, orange aeciospores, which are carried to bearberry by wind. [...] These aeciospores are capable of infecting bearberry leaves; however, they are not able to reinfect spruce. [...] Assuming favorable, moist environmental conditions upon the secondary host, these aeciospores germinate and the bearberry’s leaves develop dark purple-brown blotches. [...] Come springtime, these blotches develop waxy telia {{on the bottom of the}} leaves and pierce the bearberry’s epidermis. [...] Teliospores are produced by these telia and germinate to become basidiospores, which infect the primary spruce host when wind carries them to young, developing needles. [...] This infection in the spruce is systemic [...] and perennial, allowing the fungus to live in the brooms from year to year. [...] Upon infection of the developing spruce needles, basidiospores produce haploid mycelia that form spermatia. These spermatia do not infect either host; rather, they serve as male gametes and fertilize receptive hyphae, forming dikaryotic mycelium and in turn dikaryotic aeciospores. [...] From here the disease cycle repeats, and symptoms similar to last season arise on the spruce by midsummer.A feature unique to the Chrysomyxa arctostaphyli disease cycle is the fact that the fungus does not produce urediospores, and thus spruce broom rust is not a truly macrocyclic disease. The lack of urediospores prevents reinfection of the primary host within the same year.|$|E
40|$|Selected {{isolates}} of Cladosporium tenuissimum {{were tested}} {{for their ability}} to inhibit in vitro <b>aeciospore</b> germination of the two-needle pine stem rusts Cronartium flaccidum and Peridermium pini and to suppress disease development in planta. The antagonistic fungus displayed a number of disease-suppressive mechanisms. <b>Aeciospore</b> germination on water agar slides was reduced at 12, 18, and 24 h when a conidial suspension (1. 5 x 10 (7) conidia per ml) of the Cladosporium tenuissimum isolates was added. When the aeciospores were incubated in same-strength conidial suspensions for 1, 11, 21, and 31 days, viability was reduced at 20 and 4 degreesC. Light and scanning electron microscopy showed that rust spores were directly parasitized by Cladosporium tenuissimum and that the antagonist had evolved several strategies to breach the spore wail and gain access to the underlying tissues. Penetration occurred with or without appressoria. The hyperparasite exerted a mechanical force to destroy the spore structures (spinules, cell wall) by direct contact, penetrated the aeciospores and subsequently proliferated within them. However, an enzymatic action could also be involved. This was shown by the dissolution of the host tell wall that comes in contact with the mycelium of the mycoparasite, by the lack of indentation in the host wall at the contact site, and by the minimal swelling at the infecting hyphal tip. Culture filtrates of the hyperparasite inhibited germination of rust propagules. A compound purified from the filtrates was characterized by chemical and spectroscopic analysis as cladosporol, a known beta - 1, 3 -glucan biosynthesis inhibitor. Conidia of Cladosporium tenuissimum reduced rust development on new infected pine seedlings over 2 years under greenhouse conditions. Because the fungus is an aggressive mycoparasite, produces fungicidal metabolites, and can survive and multiply in forest ecosystems without rusts, it seems a promising agent for the biological control of pine stem rusts in Europe...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2009 North American {{cultivation}} of Ribes L. may expand as small fruit growers seek species to diversify horticultural crops. The Ribes industry was suppressed for decades {{out of fear}} that cultivated black currants and gooseberries would intensify the fungal disease white pine blister rust (WPBR) on five-needle pine (Pinus L. section Quinquefoliae) species. These pines were historically vital to the timber industry. Today, plant breeders seek to strengthen the Ribes small fruit industry through production of material suitable for North American conditions. Paramount to this effort is the development of resistance against major pests and diseases. Growers must be able to recognize the attributes of available genotypes prior to field establishment. The objectives of this research were to determine disease resistance and phenological characteristics of Ribes selections at the United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, National Clonal Germplasm Repository (NCGR) in Corvallis, Oregon. Since the early 1930 's, plant breeders have used immune black currant (R. nigrum L.) germplasm as a control tactic against the exotic WPBR, caused by the basidiomycete fungus Cronartium ribicola J. C. Fischer. In 1999, a seedling population was generated at the NCGR from a cross involving susceptible pistillate R. nigrum 'Ben Lomond' and immune staminate parent R. ussuriense Jancz. x R. nigrum 'Consort. ' To test the inheritance of resistance in the F₁ population, <b>aeciospore</b> and urediniospore treatments were applied in 2008 to single-leaf softwood cuttings under controlled conditions in a greenhouse. Resistant F₁ phenotypes segregated in a 1 : 1 ratio consistent with the pattern of simple dominant inheritance of a single gene. Artificial inoculations testing <b>aeciospore</b> and urediniospore infectivity produced equivalent disease severity in the experimental Ribes genotypes. Resistance to the native powdery mildew fungus, Podosphaera mors-uvae (Schwein.) U. Brown and S. Takamatsu, was also evaluated in the F₁ population. Individuals segregated for resistance in a 1 : 3 ratio after exposure to elevated disease pressure in the greenhouse. Fifteen F₁ genotypes were resistant to both fungal pathogens and are candidates for further breeding trials. In a second study, five years of spring phenological survey data were analyzed using a growing degree-day (GDD) model, with the objective to identify cultivars adapted to North American conditions. Ribes section Calobotrya was the earliest group to reach "first bloom," followed sequentially by R. [superscript]xnidigrolaria Bauer hybrid species, section Symphocalyx, section Grossularia, section Ribes, and lastly, section Botrycarpum. Early and late-flowering accessions were identified for each taxon...|$|E
50|$|Pustules develop on {{the leaves}} {{early in the}} season {{appearing}} as small creamy yellow spots. The spores produced in the pustules are <b>aeciospores</b> and spread the disease throughout the plant by wind. When these spores are released they are deposited as yellow powder.

40|$|Interactions between conidia of Botrytis cinerea and aeciospores of Puccinia lagenophorae (rust of {{groundsel}}, Senecio vulgaris) {{were studied}} because rusted groundsel exhibits exceptionally high mortality when additionally infected by B. cinerea. The latter {{acts as a}} secondary invader via rust pustules on leaves and stems. Conidia of B. cinerea, collected dry from parent cultures, failed to germinate on agarose in Petri dishes but did so {{in the presence of}} aeciospores, germination generally increasing as <b>aeciospore</b> concentration increased. Germination on agarose was also stimulated by diffusates from groundsel leaves and by the removal of agarose discs to the surface of groundsel leaves. Germination on such discs was higher over sporulating lesions on rusted leaves than on healthy leaves and decreased with radial distance from the centre of individual lesions. When conidia were sown directly onto the leaf, germination over epidermis {{at the edge of a}} lesion was greater than that within a lesion, but germination in both these positions was greater than that at a distance from the lesion. The promotive effects of rust on the germination of B. cinerea conidia in vivo were quantitative rather than qualitative but they explain in part the synergy between P. lagenophorae and B. cinerea...|$|E

40|$|The {{life history}} of Puccinia striiformis {{remains a mystery}} because the {{alternate}} host has never been identified. Inoculation of grasses using <b>aeciospores</b> from naturally infected Berberis chinensis and B. koreana resulted in infection on Poa pratensis, producing uredinia typical of stripe rust caused by P. striiformis. Analyses using real-time polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequence confirmed the rust fungus as P. striiformis.

50|$|Pine-pine gall rust has {{characteristically}} brown to yellow-orange sori {{visible on}} large globular galls on pines. Gall formation on trunks occurs over 2-4 {{years and is}} stimulated by the pathogen, which causes cells to grow and divide quickly {{at the site of}} initial infection. When mature, the gall splits open and the yellow-orange <b>aeciospores</b> are dispersed and carried to new hosts by wind. Because P. harknessii does not require an alternate host, the <b>aeciospores</b> can infect another pine directly. This typically occurs during moist conditions and rarely infects older shoots. Infection continues on the host shoots and needles until they have reached 90% of their elongation. Gall mortality is associated with squirrel feeding or invasion and inactivation by secondary organisms. The life cycle of E. Harknessii is different from other pine stem rust in that it is autoecious, making large stands of pines ideal hosts for survival and reproduction of the fungus.|$|R
40|$|Freezing {{of healthy}} and rust (Puccinia lagenophorae) {{infected}} leaves of Senecio vulgaris was compared calorimetrically by thermal analysis. In fully expanded leaves the threshold freezing temperature {{was in the}} range − 6. 8 to − 8. 4 °C in controls but − 3. 0 to − 5. 1 °C in leaves with sporulating rust sori. Comparable values in expanding leaves were − 5. 0 to − 8. 9 °C and − 3. 9 to − 6. 7 °C for healthy and rusted tissues, respectively. The bulk tissue freezing point was between − 1. 0 and − 4. 0 °C in both fully expanded and expanding healthy leaves, and was increased by infection by between + 0. 2 and 2. 5 °C. Whereas healthy leaves supercooled by 3. 1 − 5. 8 °C, rusted leaves supercooled by only 1. 8 − 4. 9 °C Supercooling of control leaves was reduced by dusting with <b>aeciospores,</b> particularly when leaves were wounded to simulate the rupture of the surface caused by sporulation, but wounding alone had no significant effect. Supercooling of distilled water was also significantly reduced by <b>aeciospores,</b> suspended at a concentration of 105 spores ml− 1. It is concluded that rust-induced changes in leaf freezing in S. vulgaris grown in controlled environments were due {{to an increase in}} the number of sites for ice nucleation, caused by the presence of the <b>aeciospores,</b> and increased penetration of ice into internal tissues, resulting from damage to the cuticle and epidermis. Although data for frost resistance obtained in the growth-room are similar to previous field observations, the role of the above mechanisms under field conditions remains unproven...|$|R
5000|$|In July and August, spores {{from the}} apple leaves (<b>Aeciospores)</b> are produced. The wind carries the spores back to Eastern Red Cedars, {{completing}} the infectious cycle. The spores land on cedar needle bases or in cracks or crevices of twigs. There, they germinate and produce small, green-brown swellings {{about the size}} of a pea. Galls do not produce spores until the second spring. However, mature galls usually are present every year. This fungus produces four out of five of the spores known to be produced by the class Urediniomycetes during its life cycle. (Teliospores, Basidiospores, Spermatia, and <b>Aeciospores.</b> The type of spore it does not produce is Urediospores.) Rust fungi have a complicated life-cycle with up to five types of spores (each borne on a different type of structure) in its life cycle and often an alternate host, and an [...] "alternate alternate host" [...] as well. Basidiomycetes that have all 5 spore stages and those with less are said to be [...] "macrocyclic" [...] or [...] "microcyclic" [...] respectively.|$|R
50|$|Rust fungi can be {{categorized}} by how many types of spores are produced during the life cycle. Fungi that produce all five spores (sometimes excluding pycniospores) are termed macrocyclic. Fungi that lack pycniospores and <b>aeciospores</b> in their life cycle are termed microcyclic and always have an autoecious life cycle. Demicyclic fungi delete the uredial (repeating) stage from the life cycle. Understanding the life cycles of rust fungi allows for proper disease management.|$|R
50|$|Rust is most {{commonly}} seen as coloured powder, composed of tiny <b>aeciospores</b> which land on vegetation producing pustules, or uredia, that {{form on the}} lower surfaces. During late spring or early summer, yellow orange or brown, hairlike or ligulate structures called telia grow on the leaves or emerge from bark of woody hosts such as Juniperus species. These telia produce teliospores which will germinate into aerial basidiospores, spreading and causing further infection.|$|R
5000|$|The intense odor given {{off from}} the spermogonia on the needles in the spring attract insects, which cross-fertilize the fungus. This {{fertilization}} allows for aecia to form and in turn produce <b>aeciospores.</b> Spruce broom rust is common in the western United States, specifically in the Rocky Mountain Region where it occurs on Colorado blue spruce, and in the boreal forests of Alaska and Canada where it parsitizes both white and black spruce. [...] It was originally thought {{there was not a}} connection between bearberry and spruce as hosts, as bearberry had not been documented at such of altitudes of spruce in the Rocky Mountains; it was even initially postulated that the spores found on bearberry were caused by a microcyclic rust which only infected that host and did not have an alternate. [...] However, it was eventually discovered that bearberry could be located in similar altitudes to spruce, and C. arctostaphyli was even found in bearberry at those altitudes. [...] It was then experimentally proved that when bearberry were inoculated in a moist chamber with <b>aeciospores</b> from spruce brooms, telia would begin to form.|$|R
50|$|Anton de Bary later {{conducted}} {{experiments to}} observe the beliefs of the European farmers regarding {{the relationship between the}} rust and barberry plants, and after successful attempts to connect the basidiospores of the basidia stage to barberry, he also identified that the <b>aeciospores</b> in the aecia stage reinfect the wheat host.

50|$|In the Spring, {{the very}} first spores, spermogonia, arise out of the debris {{on the ground and}} infects the young stem, {{distorting}} them and producing orange postules.

Eventually in late August, the urediniospores and sori become speckled with black fascicles and dark resting spores called teliospores. The teliospores turn into <b>aeciospores</b> which are the spores that adhere to stems and leaves to overwinter.|$|R
40|$|The {{first and}} only one {{recorded}} collection of Aecidium deutziae in Taiwan was collected by Y. Hashioka on Deutzia pulchra in 1933 without taxonomical description. For characterization of this rust fungus, A. deutziae on D. pulchra again collected near Tataka, Nantou, Taiwan in 2015, was studied. The fungus produced amphigenous spermogonia and cupulate, mainly hypophyllous aecia. The peridial cells have smooth outer wall and verrucose inner walls. <b>Aeciospores</b> are pale orange, globose to broadly ellipsoidal, minutely verrucose with granules.

50|$|Asparagus spears {{are usually}} {{harvested}} before severe rust symptoms appear. These symptoms include light green, oval lesions, followed by tan blister spots and black, projecting blisters {{later in the}} season and indicate the presence of <b>aeciospores,</b> urediospores, and teliospores, respectively. Serious rust infections stunt or kill young asparagus shoots, causing foliage to fall prematurely, and reduce the ability of the plant to store food reserves. The orange spores are the key sign for this disease because they are the easiest to spot. Examination of the plant for orange spots or laboratory techniques can sense the presence of this fungus.|$|R
50|$|Symptoms {{usually are}} {{contained}} {{to a single}} year on conifers, shedding the affected needles in fall. To survive the winter Melampsora medusae remain as teliospores on the dead leaves of the host, coming back in the spring to be spread by the wind as basidiospores, and infecting new conifers. After about two weeks, <b>aeciospores</b> are produced on the coniferous needles. Those spores serve as inoculum for an infection in live trembling aspen and other poplar trees in another two weeks. Urediniospores are produced on the poplar leaves, where the infection spreads. Winter then comes, and the cycle begins again.|$|R
50|$|Like many rust diseases, G. sabinae {{requires}} {{two different}} hosts to complete its life cycle {{from year to}} year. Juniper is the winter host and pear {{is the most common}} summer host. Spores (called <b>aeciospores)</b> are produced from the fungal lantern-shaped growths which protrude from the blisters {{on the underside of the}} pear leaf which become airborne and infect junipers. This fungus overwinters in swellings or galls on infected twigs and branches of susceptible juniper plants. In the spring after a rain or heavy dew, the galls on the juniper produce tiny dark horn-like growths that become covered with an orange-brown gelatinous mass called telia. The corresponding stage on the pear trees is known as aecia. The telia and aecia release wind borne resting or hibernating spores (called teliospores and <b>aeciospores)</b> capable of infecting susceptible pear leaves and Juniper respectively. Spores produced from the fungus-induced swellings on juniper stems can be infectious up to 6 km. The disease causes a yellow-orange spot that turns bright red on leaves of pear trees. The disease can be particularly damaging on pear, resulting in complete defoliation and crop loss if not treated. The fungus feeds on the living cells of the host plant and is not capable of surviving on dead plant material, and so must either alternate with a different host or produce resting spores to pass the dormant season. Pear rust is a regulated disease in some countries.|$|R
50|$|The disease {{cycle of}} Puccinia schedonardii does not vary from other rust disease cycles. This {{pathogen}} is heteroecious and exhibits a polycyclic disease cycle. Puccinia schedonnardii overwinters as teliospores that are produced in telia on the alternate host. In the spring, the teliospores germinate to produce basidiospores. The basidospores are then windblown to the cotton host where they enter via stomata. When basidiospores germinate, they produce a mycelium from which flask-shape pycnia {{as well as}} receptive hyphae are formed. From here, nothing happens until the pycniospores produced by the pycnia fertilize receptive hyphae of a different mating type. Over a period of five to ten days the dikaryotic mycelia formed by the joining of the receptive hyphae and the pycniospore grows through the cotton leaf to produce aecia. Aecia are the pustules seen on {{the leaves of the}} cotton. When conditions are right, and adequate moisture is achieved, <b>aeciospores</b> are released from the aecia. These <b>aeciospores</b> land on the alternate grass host and infect it via a germ tube. Eventually, a uredium is formed from this germ tube. The uredospores released by the uredium are then able to do one of two things. As a polycyclic disease, the uredospores present an opportunity for secondary infection in a single season. The spores can either reinfect grasses by spreading uredospores that become uredia which leads to more uredospores and a likely epidemic; or they can become overwintering teliospores, thus preparing for the cycle to begin again in the spring.|$|R
30|$|Ice forming {{activity}} {{occurs in}} various lifeforms including some bacteria, pollen and fungal spores. Such activity {{is associated with}} specific molecules. In some case ice nucleation activity may benefit the organism. For example, the pathogenic rust Puccinia lagenophorae possesses ice nucleation sites on its <b>aeciospores</b> {{and it has been}} shown that leaves artificially infected with this fungus and subjected to frost suffer greater penetration of ice crystals into the plants’ tissues, presumably improving access for the fungus (Paul and Ayres 1991). But sometimes such activity may be an incidental by-product of other selective processes. For example, cellulose promotes ice formation below – 21  °C (Hiranuma et al. 2015).|$|R
50|$|For Puccinia schedonnardii {{the host}} range is {{specific}} to cotton, {{but is not}} specific to a certain cotton species.

First appearing as small yellow pustules on leaves, bolls, and stems, the spots will then transform into larger, orange/red pustules which release <b>aeciospores.</b> Rust lesions can cause leaves or stems to become weak and break or fall off, resulting in decreased photosynthetic ability and extreme difficulty during harvest. Symptoms on the alternate host grasses are small ovular red/brown (rust colored) powdery lesions, which release uredospores.|$|R
