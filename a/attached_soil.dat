40|$|Several {{methods for}} {{dispersion}} of soil were tested for possible use in procedures for extraction of bacteria. Physical cell damage on cells and efficiency in extraction of indigenous cells from soil, were investigated. Cell damage by the dispersion methods was investigated {{by measuring the}} physical cell integrity and viability of pure cultures of Escherichiu coli and Bacillus subtilis, as well as soil bacteria extracted from soil, when dispersed in slurries of y-sterilized soil. Separation of bacteria and soil particles {{on the basis of}} buoyant density was conducted with the nonionic density gradient medium Nycodenz. When slurries of-y-sterilized soil with added pure cultured cells were centrifuged (10000 X g) over cushions of Nycodenz (1. 3 g ml-‘), practically all the added cells were recovered in a layer on top of the cushion. This proves that a reversible attachment and cosedimentation is not an important phenomenon in this procedure. The efficiency of the different dispersion methods for the extraction of indigenous soil bacteria, was assessed after separation of dislodged and <b>attached</b> <b>soil</b> bacteria. This separation was done either on the basis of sedimentation rate by low speed centrifugation, or buoyant density by Nycodenz density gradient centrifugation. The physical dispersion by ultrasonic treatment and chemical dispersion by the use of a chelating agent together with a detergent, were inferior to physical dispersion either by Waring blender (for large volumes) or a rotating rubber pestle treatment (for smaller volumes).

The ratio of the count of fraction A estimated by the plant infection method to that estimated by the dilution plate method increased after 5 days of soil incubation.

40|$|Systematic pre cleaning, {{disinfection}} and sterilization {{of medical}} equipment used in examination {{and treatment of}} patients are very important for safe care of the patients and the staff handling these instruments. Due to the technical properties of stainless steel, its hygienic experience and the sophisticated look of the stainless steel, it has dominated the medical health care environments for decades. The wetting properties of stainless steel surfaces are presumed to be essential for the process of clean ability and {{for a wide variety}} of bio compatibility. In collaboration with the topical company for this thesis, the idea is to find the correlation between the surface properties of various stainless steel in relation to their wetting and spreading ability to enable efficient cleaning of the surface. For a substrate surface to be thoroughly cleaned of any debris or soil, it should be able to allow proper adherence of the liquid across its surface to a certain degree good enough to ensure good wettability of the surface and conversely easy and proper removal of any <b>attached</b> <b>soil</b> on the surface.

30|$|Sodium hazard is also usually {{expressed}} in terms of the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), which is calculated from the ratio of sodium to calcium and magnesium (Todd and Mays 2005; Li et al. 2013 a). The SAR is an important parameter for the determination of the suitability of irrigation water because it is responsible for the sodium hazard (Li et al. 2016 c, d; Todd and Mays 2005). The waters were classified in relation to irrigation based on the ranges of SAR values (Richards 1954). Continued use of water having a high SAR leads to a breakdown in the physical structure of the soil. Sodium is adsorbed and becomes <b>attached</b> to <b>soil</b> particles. The soil then becomes hard and compact when dry and increasingly impervious to water penetration. The degree to which irrigation water tends to enter into cation-exchange reactions in soil can be indicated by the sodium adsorption ratio.
