Tests were performed using internally heated copper cylinders with an outside diameter 30 mm and a vertical separation distance between the cylinders ranging from two to three cylinder diameters. Plume interaction between the heated cylinders was investigated within a Rayleigh number range of 2 x 106 to 6 x 106. Spectral analysis of the associated heat transfer interaction is presented showing that interaction between the cylinders causes oscillation of the thermal plume.

Within this parameter range, it is shown that the screens, but not the freestream turbulence level, are able to produce significant variations in the turbulence structure of the vortex, and that the turbulent structure is determined by the Rossby number and not the vortex Reynolds number. It is noted that the core is dynamic and an organized exchange of momentum takes place between the outer flow and the core region of the vortex.

The flow depth was 125 mm, and the Reynolds number based on the freestream velocity and cylinder thickness was 2925. The results reveal that the mean velocities, turbulence quantities, and wake half-width increase with increasing cylinder inclination and number of cylinder.

40|$|The ensemble-average {{velocity}} and pressure in an unbounded quasi-random suspension of disks (or <b>aligned</b> <b>cylinders)</b> are calculated {{in terms of}} average multipoles allowing {{for the possibility of}} spatial nonuniformities in the system. An expression for the stress due to the suspended particles is deduced from these results. It is found that spatial non-uniformity can induce an antisymmetric component in this stress even when no external couple acts on the particles. This component has the same order of magnitude as the term responsible for the difference between the effective viscosity of the suspension and that of the pure fluid. General considerations and a simple cell model suggest that the antisymmetric component will induce a flow in the presence of gradients of the particle volume fraction or of the relative interphase velocity, for example in a sedimenting suspension with a horizontally non-uniform particle distribution. While the derivation assumes Stokes flow conditions for the local flow around the particles, the Reynolds number of the mean macroscopic flow is unrestricted. In addition to illustrating the general nature of the particle stress, this work is a necessary prerequisite {{for the development of a}} closed suspension model on the basis of direct numerical simulations...|$|R

Numerical {{simulations}} {{are presented}} for flows of inelastic non-Newtonian fluids through periodic arrays of <b>aligned</b> <b>cylinders,</b> for {{cases in which}} fluid inertia can be neglected. The truncated power-law fluid model is used to define {{the relationship between the}} viscous stress and the rate-of-strain tensor. The flow is shown to be dominated by shear effects, not extension. Numerical simulation results are presented for the drag coefficient of the cylinders and the velocity variance components, and are compared against asymptotically valid analytical results. Square and hexagonal arrays are considered, both for crossflow in the plane perpendicular to the alignment vector of the cylinders (flows along the axes of the array as well as off-axis flows), and for flow along the cylinders. It is shown that the observed strong dependence of the drag coefficient on the power-law index (through which the stress tensor is related to the rate-of-strain tensor) can be described at all solid area fractions by scaling the drag on a cylinder with appropriate velocity and length scales. The velocity variance components show only a weak dependence on the power-law index. The results for steady-state drag and velocity variances are used in an approximate theory for flows accelerated from rest.

We study granular packings consisting of macroscopic prolate, oblate and spherical grains and compare their behaviour. X-ray tomography is {{used to determine the}} particle positions and orientations in a cylindrical split bottom shear cell. Packing densities and the arrangements of individual particles in the shear zone are evaluated. For anisometric particles, we observe the competition of two opposite effects. One the one hand, the sheared granulate is dilated, {{but on the other hand}} the particles reorient and align with respect to the streamlines. Even though <b>aligned</b> <b>cylinders</b> in principle may achieve higher packing densities, this alignment compensates for the effect of dilatancy only partially. The complex rearrangements lead to a depression of the surface above the well oriented region while neigbouring parts still show the effect of dilation in the form of heaps. For grains with isotropic shapes, the surface remains rather flat. Perfect monodisperse spheres crystallize in the shear zone, whereby positional order partially overcompensates dilatancy effects. However, already slight deviations from the ideal monodisperse sphere shape inhibit crystallization. Comment: 12 pages, 13 figures, accepted in Soft Matte...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{are presented}} for flows of Bingham fluids through periodic square arrays of <b>aligned</b> <b>cylinders,</b> for {{cases in which}} fluid inertia can be neglected. The aim is to quantify the dependence of the drag coefficient of the cylinders on the Bingham number. The results for large Bingham numbers, and also for dilute arrays of cylinders (low solid area fraction) are shown to approach previous analytical results for a single cylinder. The results for concentrated arrays are shown to agree with a lubrication theory. Although the rheology is strongly nonlinear and significant unyielded regions are shown to develop, the drag coefficient is approximately a linear function of the Bingham number. This is shown {{to be the case}} for flows along a principal axis of the array and also seems to hold for flow at 45 degrees (in the plane perpendicular to the cylinders). It is shown that the drag force on a cylinder in the array immersed in a Bingham fluid is approximately equal to the sum of the drag forces in the corresponding cases of Newtonian and perfectly plastic fluids. This result is used to derive a criterion for the critical pressure gradient, required for flow. Implications for large-scale modeling of flow through fibrous media are discussed.

40|$|The {{topology}} and {{geometry of}} microstructures {{play a crucial}} role in determining their heat transfer performance in passive cooling devices such as heat pipes. It is therefore important to characterize microstructures based on their wicking performance, the thermal conduction resistance of the liquid filling the microstructure, and the thin-film characteristics of the liquid meniscus. In the present study, the free-surface shapes of the static liquid meniscus in common microstructures are modeled using SURFACE EVOLVER for zero Bond number. Four well-defined topologies, viz., surfaces with parallel rectangular ribs, horizontal parallel <b>cylinders,</b> vertically <b>aligned</b> <b>cylinders,</b> and spheres (the latter two in both square and hexagonal packing arrangements), are considered. Nondimensional capillary pressure, average distance of the liquid free-surface from solid walls (a measure of the conduction resistance of the liquid), total exposed area, and thin-film area are computed. These performance parameters are presented as functions of the nondimensional geometrical parameters characterizing the microstructures, the volume of the liquid filling the structure, and the contact angle between the liquid and solid. Based on these performance parameters, hexagonally-packed spheres on a surface are identified to be the most efficient microstructure geometry for wicking and thin-film evaporation. The solid-liquid contact angle and the nondimensional liquid volume that yield the best performance are also identified. The optimum liquid level in the wick pore that yields the highest capillary pressure and heat transfer is obtained by analyzing the variation in capillary pressure and heat transfer with liquid level and using an effective thermal resistance model for the wick...|$|R

Numerical {{simulations}} {{are presented}} for flows of inelastic non-Newtonian fluids through periodic arrays of <b>aligned</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The truncated power-law fluid model {{is used for}} the relationship between the viscous stress and the rate-of-strain tensor. Results for the drag coefficient for creeping flows of such fluids have been presented in a companion paper [1]. In this second part the effects of finite fluid inertia are investigated for flows through square arrays. It is shown that the Reynolds-number dependence of the drag coefficient of a cylinder in the array is of the form Cd ≡ F/(ηU) = k 0 + k 2 Re 2 + [...] for small values of the Reynolds number Re ≡ ρaU/η, where F is the drag force, U is the averaged velocity in the array, η = K(U/a) n− 1 is a viscosity scale with K and n the power-law coefficient and index and a the cylinder radius, and k 0 is the drag coefficient for creeping flows. The proportionality constant k 2 depends on the way the drag coefficient and the Reynolds number are defined. It is shown that the observed strong dependence of k 2 on n can almost be eliminated by using length scales different from a in the viscosity scales η used in the definition of Re and in the definition of the drag coefficient. Numerical simulation results are also presented for the velocity variance components. Results for flows at moderate Reynolds number, of order 100, are also presented; these are qualitatively similar to those for Newtonian fluids. The value of the Reynolds number beyond which the flow becomes unsteady was related to the Newtonian fluid case by rescaling. These results for moderate-Reynolds-number flow are compared against previously published experimental data...|$|R

University of Missouri [...] Columbia 2011. "December 2011 "Optical methods are promising for non-invasive tissue characterization. Biological tissues can be classified into isotropic tissues and anisotropic tissues. The optical properties of isotropic tissues such as adipose tissue are independent of measurement direction. However, optical properties of anisotropic tissues such as tendon are different along different measurement directions. We used Monte Carlo simulation to study light propagation in fibrous tissues such as tendon and cartilage. Fibrous tissues were modeled as a mixture of <b>aligned</b> <b>cylinders</b> and randomly distributed background spherical particles. Both spatial- and time-resolved reflectance measurements were simulated and compared with predictions from anisotropic diffuse theory. Optical scattering and absorption properties of fibrous tissue can be measured by numerically fitting the analytical diffuse solution to time-resolved reflectance. The results indicated that both isotropic and anisotropic diffuse theory can be applied to derive the background optical properties of fibrous tissue. The scattering properties of the fibrous component can also be also determined if the fiber size is known. Experimental studies were also conducted to study time-resolved reflectance in fibrous tissue by using a fiber optics based low-coherence Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The experimental system was validated in tissue phantoms. In tendon samples, the measured time-resolved reflectance was different at different measurement angles, which was satisfactorily explained by using the anisotropic diffuse theory. Both optical absorption and scattering properties can be derived by fitting the time-resolved isotropic diffusion solution to experimental measurements...|$|R
