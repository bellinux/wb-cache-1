5|$|The {{relationship}} between the three domains is of central importance for understanding the origin of life. Most of the metabolic pathways, which are {{the object of the}} majority of an organism's genes, are common between Archaea and Bacteria, while most genes involved in genome expression are common between Archaea and Eukarya. Within prokaryotes, archaeal cell structure is most similar to that of gram-positive bacteria, largely because both have a single lipid bilayer and usually contain a thick sacculus (exoskeleton) of varying chemical composition. In some phylogenetic trees based upon different gene/protein sequences of prokaryotic homologs, the archaeal homologs are more closely related to those of gram-positive bacteria. Archaea and gram-positive bacteria also share conserved indels in a number of important proteins, such as Hsp70 and glutamine synthetaseI; however, the phylogeny of these genes was interpreted to reveal interdomain gene transfer, <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> reflect the organismal relationship(s).|$|E

Imagine highways that alert motorists of a traffic jam before it forms. Or bridges that report when they are at risk of collapse, or an electric grid that fixes itself when blackouts hit.

25|$|The {{same was}} {{generally}} true of other electric folk outfits. The late 1970s and early 1980s were {{a time to}} either abandon the genre or fight a losing struggle for survival. The reason is often said to be punk rock, which reached a peak in 1976-7. It changed the ethos of popular music, overturning certainties about musicianship and songwriting and had no greater target than the old fashioned folk musicians of the preceding generation. All popular music trends have a generational problem as their audiences grow <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be replaced, but for folk rock the discontinuity was very acute. One result was a further hybridisation {{with the development of}} folk punk among younger acts in the later 1970s, some of which, like the Pogues and The Levellers, achieved some mainstream success. The early 1980s were the nadir of electric folk, when, in contrast to the mid-1970s only the Albion Band (with the associated Home Service) and the Oysterband remained as major exponents of the genre and this was perhaps their least productive period.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to {{arguing that the}} rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory {{point out that the}} symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance; and that the DNA results may be flawed <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have been repeated elsewhere, despite extensive samples from other mass graves. Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague—which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups.|$|E
25|$|There are {{problems}} that may hinder the development the modeling of reading behaviours. First, computer models in reading {{tend to make}} assumptions of direct links between lexical properties and saccade attributes (by putting a formula linking the two into the model). These links are descriptive generalizations of existing empirical data and normally do not survive new data. In search for new data to support their models, researcher might have to keep adding and adjusting lexical process assumptions {{and are likely to}} ignore possible parsimonious process that underlies these assumptions. Caution should be taken when adding assumptions of how lexical processes affect saccade programming because reading is not what humans are evolved to do. The modeling of eye-movements in reading should treat reading as special case of visual perception and take into account more basic oculomotor properties(e.g., split fovea, depth perception) before making assumptions about the link between lexical processes and eye movements. Another problem is {{that there has been a}} lack of comparison between models on the same data set. Researcher teams tend to focus on the development of their own model <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be able to fully appreciate the merits of other models due to the technical difficulties in sharing programs. In the future we might see unifying model that both explains complex reading behaviors well and is parsimonious enough to be generalizable to other eye-tracking fields such as visual search, scene viewing.|$|E

25|$|The {{most notable}} feature of Miragaia is its long neck, which was {{composed}} of at least seventeen vertebrae. According to the authors, this represents {{the culmination of a}} trend towards longer necks seen in stegosaurians. The Thyreophora, the larger group they belong to, originally seem to have had nine neck vertebrae and this is also the number shown by the basal stegosaurian Huayangosaurus. Later forms like Stegosaurus or Hesperosaurus had twelve or thirteen. This is the more remarkable that Miragaia had more neck vertebrae than most sauropods, a different group of dinosaurs and one that is famous for its long necks, which contrasts with the traditional view of stegosaurians as low browsers with short necks. Only the Chinese sauropods Euhelopus, Mamenchisaurus and Omeisaurus had as many neck vertebrae as Miragaia, with most sauropods of the Late Jurassic possessing only twelve to fifteen. Mateus and colleagues suggested that the long neck either allowed Miragaia to browse at a level that other herbivores were not exploiting, or that the neck arose due to sexual selection. The possible food gathering function of the neck makes sexual selection a less plausible explanation, but is not in itself entirely convincing: though the contemporary Iberian sauropods Lusotitan, Dinheirosaurus and Turiasaurus were all very large <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have competed with a medium-height browser, the niche partitioning is still problematic because in Iberia stegosaurian remains have been referred to Dacentrurus and Stegosaurus, which would have possessed a feeding envelope or feeding height stratification overlapping that of Miragaia.|$|E

He also said that she would be eligible for parole in 18 to 24 months because the murder weapon was never found. If the murder weapon had been found, Texas law [...] required all individuals convicted in a murder case to serve at least a fourth of their sentence before being eligible for parole.

500|$|Amongst {{individual}} Australian soldiers, {{the news}} of the victory helped to dispel some of the notions about the invincibility of the Japanese soldier that had developed in the psyche of Allied soldiers following the defeats of early 1942, and which had impacted on Allied planning up to that point.
