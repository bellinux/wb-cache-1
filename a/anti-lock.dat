5|$|The BA model {{represented}} a A$500million investment, and 24,000hours of engine and durability testing. Germany's Nürburgring test track {{was used for}} some suspension testing. The <b>anti-lock</b> brakes and electronic stability control were calibrated in Sweden, as well as Australia.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} {{the end of}} the second queue, guests were loaded into test cars. Upon dispatching from the loading dock, the car was brought through an accelerated hill climb. Next, the car's suspension was tested over different types of road surfaces, including German and Belgian blocks & cobblestones. Next, the car's <b>anti-lock</b> braking system was turned off and the car tried to navigate a course of cones, knocking many over in the process. The <b>anti-lock</b> brakes were then turned back on and a similar cone course was navigated easily. Guests were shown a video overlay of the difference. Then, the cars were brought through 3 environmental chambers: a heat chamber, a cold chamber, and a corrosion chamber.|$|E
5|$|A new wider {{front track}} was {{introduced}} to address issues with the previous carried-over VL chassis components. In August 1992, <b>anti-lock</b> brakes were introduced as an option on the Calais and SS trim levels, later becoming optional on all Series II variants. This January 1993 update also included a colour-coded grille for the Executive and alloy wheels for the Commodore S.|$|E
5|$|The chassis was {{manufactured}} from aluminium using Alcan's bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT), {{and had a}} wheelbase of 2845mm. The {{design for}} the chassis featured rear wheel steering and packaged the fuel tank behind the centre bulkhead. Suspension design largely focused on road use, but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable. The concept car was fitted with a four-channel <b>anti-lock</b> braking system.|$|E
5|$|MacPherson struts {{are used}} in the front suspension, and an unusual three-link De Dion tube/Watt's linkage is used in the rear. Front discs with <b>anti-lock</b> braking (ABS) and {{electronic}} brakeforce distribution (EBD) are standard across the range. In common with many other mid- or rear-engined vehicles its fifteen-inch wheels have uneven-sized tires, 145/65 on the fronts and wider 175/55 on the rears, in an effort to minimise the chances of oversteer caused by the rear-biased weight distribution.|$|E
5|$|Passenger safety {{was a key}} design aspect for the Ford engineers. <b>Anti-lock</b> brakes were {{standard}} on all models; electronic brakeforce distribution was also {{standard on}} most variants. The addition of traction control for higher trim levels helped to prevent loss of traction. On top of this, dual front airbags were a standard fitment across the range; side-impact airbags were equipped on higher luxury levels such as the Fairmont. In a crash safety assessment conducted by ANCAP, the BA model scored 27.27 {{out of a possible}} 37 points, giving a rating of four out of five stars.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{played a}} {{substantial}} {{role in the}} development of the VX model. Bosch 5.3 <b>anti-lock</b> brakes were made standard on all variants, a first for an Australian manufactured car; and traction control was made available on vehicles equipped with manual transmission. Extensive research was undertaken to reduce the effects from a side-impact collision through modification of the B-pillars. The risk presented by a side-impact collision in a VX fitted without side airbags is reduced by 50percent when compared to a similarly specified VT model.|$|E
5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. <b>Anti-lock</b> Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
25|$|The <b>anti-lock</b> brake {{controller}} {{is also known}} as the CAB (Controller <b>Anti-lock</b> Brake).|$|E
25|$|Bosch ESP5.7 Electronic Stability Programme, with <b>Anti-lock</b> Braking System (ABS), Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), and Brake Assist (BA) was {{standard}} fitment.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Lincoln {{became one}} of the first {{automobile}} companies to provide standard four-wheel <b>anti-lock</b> brakes on all of their vehicles.|$|E
25|$|ESC {{incorporates}} {{yaw rate}} control into the <b>anti-lock</b> braking system (ABS). Yaw is a rotation around the vertical axis; i.e. spinning left or right. <b>Anti-lock</b> brakes enable ESC to brake individual wheels. Many ESC systems also incorporate a {{traction control system}} (TCS or ASR), which senses drive-wheel slip under acceleration and individually brakes the slipping wheel or wheels and/or reduces excess engine power until control is regained. However, ESC serves a different purpose from that of ABS or Traction Control.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, GM {{produced}} the first rear wheel <b>Anti-lock</b> brake {{system in the}} world for two of their cars: the Toronado and Eldorado.|$|E
25|$|Pontiac {{dropped the}} coupe version (2-door) for 2003 and made <b>anti-lock</b> brakes and {{traction}} control optional instead of standard {{on most of}} the remaining sedans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anti-lock</b> {{braking system}} (ABS) is {{optional}} on all models for 1992, the 2.3L Quad 4 engine was dropped, and the LE sedan gained the SE/STE front lightbar.|$|E
25|$|Every 20,000 kilometres, a 2½ hour {{inspection}} is conducted, called Nachschau. In this inspection, the brakes, the Linienzugbeeinflussung {{systems and}} the <b>anti-lock</b> brakes are checked as well.|$|E
25|$|The upscale LXi {{model was}} {{distinguishable}} {{as it did}} not have a retractable antenna, but a fixed antenna inside the rear passenger-side fender. <b>Anti-lock</b> brakes (ABS) were standard, with traction control optional.|$|E
25|$|As a first example, {{consider}} an <b>anti-lock</b> braking system, directed by a microcontroller chip. The microcontroller {{has to make}} decisions based on brake temperature, speed, and other variables in the system.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, a Royal Enfield Super Meteor {{motorcycle}} {{was used}} by the Road Research Laboratory to test the Maxaret <b>anti-lock</b> brake. The experiments demonstrated that <b>anti-lock</b> brakes can be of great value to motorcycles, for which skidding is involved in a high proportion of accidents. Stopping distances were reduced in most of the tests compared with locked wheel braking, particularly on slippery surfaces, in which the improvement could be as much as 30percent. Enfield's technical director at the time, Tony Wilson-Jones, saw little future in the system, however, and it was not put into production by the company.|$|E
25|$|All models come {{standard}} with side torso airbags, {{side curtain}} airbags, <b>anti-lock</b> braking and electronic brakeforce distribution. For the 2010 model the previously optional Vehicle Stability Control and traction control systems became standard.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anti-lock</b> brakes are {{the subject}} of some {{experiments}} centred around risk compensation theory, which asserts that drivers adapt to the safety benefit of ABS by driving more aggressively. In a Munich study, half a fleet of taxicabs was equipped with <b>anti-lock</b> brakes, while the other half had conventional brake systems. The crash rate was substantially the same for both types of cab, and Wilde concludes this was due to drivers of ABS-equipped cabs taking more risks, assuming that ABS would take care of them, while the non-ABS drivers drove more carefully since ABS would not be there to help in case of a dangerous situation.|$|E
25|$|Standard (US & Canada) {{multi-stage}} front {{driver and}} passenger air bags, front-seat-mounted side air bags, three-row side-curtain air bags, standard four-wheel disc <b>anti-lock</b> brakes (ABS), {{electronic stability program}} (ESP), and electronic roll mitigation, brake assist.|$|E
25|$|In the United States and Canada, all 2005 MY {{and later}} CR-Vs have <b>anti-lock</b> brakes, {{electronic}} brake force distribution, traction control and Vehicle Stability Assist, front seat-mounted side airbags, and side-curtain airbags with rollover sensors for all occupants.|$|E
25|$|The {{new look}} did not stem sagging sales. The 1991 models made remote keyless entry and <b>anti-lock</b> brakes standard, {{increased}} horsepower, and offered an ultrasuede upholstery option. The optional moonroof no longer required bucket seats to be ordered.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anti-lock</b> {{braking systems}} use {{different}} schemes {{depending on the}} type of brakes in use. They can be differentiated by the number of channels: that is, how many valves that are individually controlled—and the number of speed sensors.|$|E
25|$|Other {{features}} {{included a}} drive-by-wire electronic throttle, a five-speed automatic transmission, <b>anti-lock</b> brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist {{as well as}} electronic stability and traction control systems. The fourth-generation Lexus ES was built in Kyūshū and Toyota, Aichi, Japan.|$|E
25|$|The Enhanced Mobility Package (EMP) option adds an uprated suspension, 4-wheel <b>anti-lock</b> brakes, a locking rear differential, {{beadlock}} tires, a {{tire pressure}} monitoring system and other upgrades. About 2,000 LSSV units {{have been sold}} to U.S. and international military and law enforcement organizations.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Harley {{added the}} <b>anti-lock</b> braking {{system as a}} factory {{installed}} option on all VRSC models. Harley also increased the displacement of the stock engine from , which had only previously been available from Screamin' Eagle, and added a slipper clutch as standard equipment.|$|E
25|$|Prior to launch, various {{observers}} {{said the}} Ninja H2-H2R {{could be expected}} to have electronic rider aids including <b>anti-lock</b> braking system (ABS), traction control (KTRC), engine braking control (KEBC), Kawasaki quick shifter (KQS), electronic steering damper (ESD), and launch control (KLCM) which are now confirmed.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{equipment}} on the launch models included dual front and side airbags, pretentioners and load limiters {{for the front}} seatbelts, <b>anti-lock</b> brakes, traction control, power steering, and air conditioning. Satellite navigation was also available, initially using maps on CD, then moving to DVD maps in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Although {{updating}} and revamping continued {{throughout the}} 1990s, the vast change seen during the 1980s did not. The period between 1989 and 1997 {{can best be}} described as one of continuous refinement. <b>Anti-lock</b> brakes, GM's Quad-4 engine, airbags and composite materials all became standard on Pontiacs during this time.|$|E
25|$|The A1 model {{features}} uprated AxleTech 5000 Series axles, an <b>anti-lock</b> braking system with traction control and a Dana central tire inflation system. Armor mode increases tire pressures {{to compensate for}} the added weight of the B-kit armor. The operator can manually increase or decrease differential locking based on conditions.|$|E
25|$|Safety {{features}} {{included a}} driver's SRS airbag and <b>anti-lock</b> brakes. In typical specification, the ES 250 further included 15-inch alloy wheels, a power driver's seat, power moonroof, and CD player. Leather upholstery was common equipment, despite being listed as an option, while some ES 250s were also produced with cloth interiors.|$|E
25|$|The 1991 {{model was}} {{completely}} restyled—It replaced the 1977-based rectilinear design with rounded, more aerodynamic sheetmetal. While {{the body and}} interior were all new, excluding the <b>Anti-Lock</b> Braking System, the chassis and powertrain were carried over from the 1990 model. Several major components (including the floor pan) are entirely interchangeable between 1977 and 1996.|$|E
25|$|The 1991 {{model year}} had little {{news for the}} Premier except for a new <b>anti-lock</b> braking system (ABS) that was also {{available}} on the Canadian-built Dodge Monaco twin. The new safety feature came standard on the ES Limited and was optional on other models. The Limited model received a new front grille and rear tail lamp assemblies.|$|E
25|$|Since initial {{widespread}} use in production cars, <b>anti-lock</b> braking {{systems have been}} improved considerably. Recent versions not only prevent wheel lock under braking, but also electronically control the front-to-rear brake bias. This function, depending on its specific capabilities and implementation, is known as electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD), traction control system, emergency brake assist, or electronic stability control (ESC).|$|E
