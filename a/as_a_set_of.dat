5|$|French Sudan {{originally}} formed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> military outposts as {{an extension}} of the French colony in Senegal. Though the area offered France little economic or strategic gain, the military effectively advocated greater conquest in the region. This was partly due to a fascination with the great empires, such as the Mali Empire and the Songhay Empire that rose to prominence in the area, and partly due to the promotional opportunities that military conquest offered for French military personnel.|$|E
5|$|In a {{broadcast}} system, the central high-powered broadcast tower transmits a high-frequency electromagnetic wave to numerous low-powered receivers. The high-frequency wave {{sent by the}} tower is modulated with a signal containing visual or audio information. The receiver is then tuned so as {{to pick up the}} high-frequency wave and a demodulator is used to retrieve the signal containing the visual or audio information. The broadcast signal can be either analog (signal is varied continuously with respect to the information) or digital (information is encoded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> discrete values).|$|E

5|$|In practice, the MSE is a {{blend of}} empathic {{descriptive}} phenomenology and empirical clinical observation. It has been argued that the term phenomenology has become corrupted in clinical psychiatry: current usage, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> supposedly objective descriptions of a psychiatric patient (a synonym for signs and symptoms), is incompatible with the original meaning which was concerned with comprehending a patient's subjective experience.|$|E
5|$|The Dry Salvages is {{the third}} poem of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets and marks the {{beginning}} of when the series was consciously being formed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> four poems. It was written and published in 1941 during the air-raids on Great Britain, an event that threatened him while giving lectures in the area. The title comes from the name of a rock formation near a town he spent time at as a child, which reflects Eliot's references to his own past throughout the poem.|$|E
5|$|The Maktab Khana ("Clerk's Quarters") {{originally}} {{known as}} Dawlat Khana-e-Jahangir, {{was constructed in}} 1617 {{under the supervision of}} Mamur Khan during the reign of Jahangir <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> cloisters near the Moti Masjid. Designed by Khawaja Jahan Muhammad Dost, it was used as passage to the Audience Hall from the palace buildings to the north. Clerks in the Maktab Khana would also record the entry of guests into the fort. It features iwans in the Persian-Timurid style in each of its four sides. Each iwan is flanked by arches.|$|E
5000|$|A {{decision}} problem is represented <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>A</b> <b>of</b> natural numbers (or strings). An {{instance of the}} problem is an arbitrary natural number (or string).

5|$|The biblical view of {{the late}} Iron Age {{political}} and cultural map describes it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> branching genealogies. Biblical figures three generations forward from Terah are invariably described as the eponymous founders of different tribes and polities that interacted with the Kingdom of Judah between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE. Such {{is the case of}} the Qedarite Arabs, who according to biblical tradition, are the offspring of the Abraham-Ishmael-Kedar genealogical line.|$|E
5|$|Wang tiles are squares {{coloured}} on each edge, {{and placed}} so that abutting edges of adjacent tiles {{have the same}} colour; hence they are sometimes called Wang dominoes. A suitable set of Wang dominoes can tile the plane, but only aperiodically. This is known because any Turing machine can be represented <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> Wang dominoes that tile the plane {{if and only if}} the Turing machine does not halt. Since the halting problem is undecidable, the problem of deciding whether a Wang domino set can tile the plane is also undecidable.|$|E
5|$|Because of this {{beginning}} of the incursion of Europeans into the area, {{the members of the}} Confederacy helped shape the development of North America throughout the 18th century, becoming a centre of trade and culture. Great Britain supported this strengthening of the tribes in the area <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> allies against the French and the Iroqouis. The people of the Three Fires Confederacy, however, sided with the French during the Seven Years' War and only made peace with Great Britain after the Treaty of Fort Niagara in 1764. It also fought {{on the side of the}} British during the War of 1812. The Three Fires Confederacy also broke several treaties with the United States prior to 1815, but finally signed the Treaty of Springwells in September of that year and ceased all hostilities directed at the United States. The Grand Council survived intact until the middle to late 19th century, when more modern political systems began to evolve.|$|E

The 1960 film The Last Voyage was filmed on board the Íle de France, which was used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> floating prop and was scuttled for the occasion. The 1972 film The Poseidon Adventure has become a classic of the genre and has spawned many remakes.|$|R

5|$|Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually {{consisting}} {{of one to}} four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time. DNA testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods. Clans, {{the next level of}} resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans. The final association layer, perhaps more arbitrarily defined than the familial groupings, is called the community, and is defined <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> clans that regularly commingle. Clans within a community do not share vocal patterns.|$|E
5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E
5|$|For his texts, Arcadelt chose poets {{ranging from}} Petrarch (and his setting of a {{complete}} canzone, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> five interrelated madrigals, was the predecessor of the vogue for madrigal cycles), Pietro Bembo, Sannazaro, to Florentines Lorenzino de'Medici, Benedetto Varchi, Filippo Strozzi, and Michelangelo himself, to others such as Luigi Cassola of Piacenza, a now-obscure writer who {{was among the most}} often-set poets of the early madrigalists. Much of the poetry of Arcadelt's madrigals has remained anonymous, just as some of Arcadelt's music is believed to survive anonymously. Another poet he set was the Marquis Alfonso d'Avalos, who wrote the words to his most single famous composition, {{and one of the most}} enduring of the entire 16th century: the four-voice madrigal Il bianco e dolce cigno (The white and gentle swan).|$|E

5|$|Lacombe and Laughlin—along with a {{group of}} United Nations experts—continue to {{investigate}} increasing UFO activity and strange, related occurrences. Witnesses in Dharamshala, India report that the UFOs make distinctive sounds: a five-tone musical phrase in a major scale. Scientists broadcast the phrase to outer space, but are mystified by the response: a seemingly meaningless series of numbers (104 44 30 40 36 10) repeated over and over until Laughlin, with his background in cartography, recognizes it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> geographical coordinates, which point to Devils Tower near Moorcroft, Wyoming. Lacombe and the U.S. military converge on Wyoming. The United States Army evacuates the area, planting false reports in the media that a train wreck has spilled a toxic nerve gas, all the while preparing a secret landing zone for the UFOs and their occupants.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{domestic}} architecture {{had continued}} to develop, with the Normans, having first occupied the older Anglo-Saxon dwellings, rapidly beginning to build larger buildings in stone and timber. The elite preferred houses with large, ground-floor halls but the less wealthy constructed simpler houses with the halls on the first floor; master and servants frequently {{lived in the same}} spaces. Wealthier town-houses were also built using stone, and incorporated business and domestic arrangements into a single functional design. By the 14th century grander houses and castles were sophisticated affairs: expensively tiled, often featuring murals and glass windows, these buildings were often designed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> apartments to allow greater privacy. Fashionable brick began to be used {{in some parts of the}} country, copying French tastes. Architecture that emulated the older defensive designs remained popular. Less is known about the houses of peasants during this period, although many peasants appear to have lived in relatively substantial, timber-framed long-houses; the quality of these houses improved in the prosperous years following the Black Death, often being built by professional craftsmen.|$|E
5|$|Plan 9 {{demonstrated}} that an integral concept of Unix—that every system interface could be represented <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> files—could be successfully implemented {{in a modern}} distributed system. Some features from Plan 9, like the UTF-8 character encoding of Unicode, have been implemented in other operating systems. Unix-like operating systems such as Linux have implemented 9P, Plan 9's file system, and have adopted features of rfork, Plan 9's process creation mechanism. Additionally, in Plan 9 from User Space, several of Plan 9's applications and tools, including the sam and acme editors, have been ported to Unix and Linux systems and have achieved some level of popularity. Several projects seek to replace the GNU operating system programs surrounding the Linux kernel with the Plan 9 operating system programs. The 9wm window manager was inspired by 8½, the older windowing system of Plan 9; wmii is also heavily influenced by Plan 9.|$|E

5|$|Starting in April 2006, Bethesda {{released}} small {{packages of}} additional downloadable content (DLC) {{for the game}} from their website and over the Xbox Live Marketplace. The first update came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> specialized armor for Oblivions ridable horses; released on April 3, 2006. Although gamers generally displayed enthusiasm for the concept of micropayments for downloadable in-game content, many expressed their dissatisfaction at the price they {{had to pay for}} the relatively minor horse-armor package on the Internet and elsewhere. Hines assured the press that Bethesda was not going to respond rashly to customer criticism. New releases continued into late 2006, at lower prices with more substantial content, leading to a better reception in the gaming press. Other small DLC packs include a set of houses themed after the game's factions, a new dungeon, and new spells that were absent in the initial release. Oblivions final content pack was released October 15, 2007.|$|E
