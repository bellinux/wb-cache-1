5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion <b>and</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Army's {{modernization}} {{effort in}} the 1980s corps units introduced new organizations and equipment including the M1 Abrams tank, M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle, AH-64 Apache helicopter, Multiple Launch Rocket System, and Mobile Subscriber Equipment.

During this time, the corps began assisting in the training <b>and</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> active and reserve component units. This support involves training guidance, resources, {{and the maintenance of}} relationships that extend to wartime affiliations.|$|E

Lent flew a number of operational patrols in this conflict until his Staffel relocated again to Rangsdorf on 29 September 1938. After the tension over the occupation of the Sudeten territories eased, Lent's unit began a conversion to the Messerschmitt Bf 108 Taifun. On 1 November 1938 III./JG132 moved to Fürstenwalde, between Berlin and Frankfurt an der Oder, and was renamed II./JG141, and Lent was posted to the 6th Squadron.|$|E

He consequently protected their interests throughout his reign; for example, he passed a law binding serfs to lands owned by aristocrats. From the standpoint of religious jurisdiction, the Treaty of Alba Iulia had another important consequence: it placed all the Eastern Orthodox bishops in Transylvania {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Metropolitan Seat of Târgovişte.|$|E

The compromise was to state that no support could come from Parliamentary funds, but the associations were effectively free to raise money themselves for this purpose.|$|E

5|$|The Junta was {{rejected}} in Montevideo, {{as was the}} exile of Cisneros and the former Audiencia. Moreno reacted immediately, replying to the Montevidean concerns. He supported {{the legitimacy of the}} Primera Junta by criticizing the Regency Council and stating that the overseas Spanish territories were equally capable of creating Juntas, as it was debated during the open cabildo. He also called for unity <b>and</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the metropolis, and that both cities recognize Ferdinand VII as their legitimate monarch. He argued that the Junta treated the exiles initially with moderation, but their obstinacy, particularly on the part of Cisneros, generated popular discontent. Matías Irigoyen told the same thing to the British Lord Strangford in Río de Janeiro.|$|E

The Air Force returned to England {{for the first time}} since World War II when Johnson organized the 3rd Air Division there on 20 August 1948.

5|$|Beginning in the 1950s, Béla H. Bánáthy, Chairman of the Leadership Training Committee of the Monterey Bay Area Council, {{formulated}} {{the idea}} of an experimental leadership training program. He named it White Stag Leadership Development after the white stag of Hungarian mythology, the emblem of the Fourth World Scout Jamboree, which Bela had attended when he was 14 years old. With the active interest <b>and</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the Monterey Bay Area Council executive staff and board, Bela continually improved his experimental program. In 1963 Maury Tripp and Fran Peterson were working closely with Bela. They also served on the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America and brought the White Stag program to their attention. In November 1963, Dr. John W. Larson, a staff researcher for the National Council, observed the program's annual Indaba at the Presidio of Monterey. Impressed with what he witnessed, he recommended that the national office conduct a detailed analysis of the White Stag program.|$|E
5|$|Day of Defeat: Source has {{undergone}} several updates. These updates have consisted of gameplay tweaks, maps and graphical effects. The first new level {{was released on}} November 30, 2005, and was followed on January 25, 2006 by another map, used as a demonstration for the Source engine's abilities in rendering snow and ice. A major update was announced on June 22, 2006, adding the detonation game mode, various gameplay tweaks and two further maps to accommodate the new game mode. The update was released on June 28, 2006. On April 26, 2007, a group of maps produced by the game's community, entitled the Community Assembled Map Pack (CAMP1), was released. Consisting of three maps, the pack was created with the assistance <b>and</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> Valve. This was followed by CAMP2 on July 26, 2007, a pack which consisted of a further five maps. On May 23, 2008, Valve announced another major update to Day of Defeat: Source, this time giving the game support for the company's new Steamworks programmer. The update is open to any owners of Day of Defeat: Source. Along with various gameplay tweaks, the update moves the game to the Source engine version used with The Orange Box, allowing the game to utilize particle effects, as well as adding a map based on a long-standing custom map for Day of Defeat and 54 achievement awards for players completing certain tasks.|$|E

40|$|Research {{indicates}} that people volunteer {{and participate in}} associational life because they are asked to. In other words, the way <b>of</b> addressing <b>and</b> <b>supporting</b> volunteers <b>and</b> participants, determines who is participating, who becomes a volunteer, and which work volunteers do. So mechanism <b>of</b> addressing <b>and</b> <b>supporting</b> are {{at the forefront of}} the discussion about voluntary work and the problems of participation in associational life. Our research ‘participation in associational life’ makes practices <b>of</b> addressing <b>and</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>of</b> associations in socio-cultural work with adults visible. &# 13; The focus is on the policies of the associations and their ‘mechanism’ and on the diversity in forms of participation. The research results indicate that addressing <b>and</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>of</b> participants is based on accidental factors, and less on a thorough analysis of the meaning of associational life and the contribution made by volunteers in society...|$|R
5|$|In January 1915, British {{artillery}} {{arrived in}} Belgrade, further bolstering its defences. On 22 April 1915, a British picket boat {{that had been}} brought overland by rail from Salonika was used to attack the Danube Flotilla anchorage at Zemun, firing two torpedoes without success. Bulgaria joined the Central Powers in September 1915, and the Serbian Army soon faced an overwhelming Austro-Hungarian, German and Bulgarian ground invasion. On 7 October, the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army attacked Belgrade, and Körös, along {{with the majority of}} the flotilla, was heavily engaged in support of the crossings near the Belgrade Fortress and Ada Ciganlija island. During the final river crossing <b>and</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the resulting bridgehead, the ship provided close support, during which her stack was hit and damaged.

5|$|In {{response}} to Godas' emissaries, Justinian detailed Cyril, {{one of the}} officers of the foederati, with 400 men, to accompany the invasion fleet and then sail on to Sardinia. Gelimer reacted to Godas' rebellion by sending the bulk of his fleet, 120 of his best vessels, and 5,000 men under his own brother Tzazon, to suppress it. The Vandal king's decision {{played a crucial role in}} the outcome of the war, for it removed from the scene the Vandal navy, the main obstacle to a Roman landing in Africa, as well as a large part of his army. Gelimer also chose to ignore the revolt in Tripolitania for the moment, as it was both a lesser threat and more remote, while his lack of manpower constrained him to await Tzazon's return from Sardinia before undertaking further campaigns. At the same time, both rulers tried to win over allies: Gelimer contacted the Visigoth king Theudis (r. 531–548) and proposed an alliance, while Justinian secured the benevolent neutrality <b>and</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy, which had strained relations with the Vandals over the ill treatment of the Ostrogoth princess Amalafrida, the wife of Thrasamund. The Ostrogoth court readily agreed to allow the Roman invasion fleet to use the harbour of Syracuse in Sicily and establish a market for the provisioning of the Roman troops there.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2008, amid {{complaints}} {{directed toward}} CIA president Tim Ryan, the school's teachers' union approved {{a vote of}} no confidence, with a vote of 85 to 9.

The largest complaints, {{laid out in a}} thirteen-item list, included outdated technology, poorly-designed uniforms, poor-quality classes and dining hall meals, excessive tuition, students admitted with no chance of succeeding, substandard school-brand kitchen equipment, overcrowded classes and residence halls, complicated schedules, and poor record-keeping. The document described President Ryan as taking an autocratic style, ignoring staff input, and retaliating against criticism. Ryan later met with union representatives and described coming improvements in scheduling and curriculum. Immediately after the faculty's vote of no confidence, the board of trustees unanimously voted to their confidence <b>and</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> Ryan and extended his contract.|$|E
