Knowing that {{the addition of a}} seamless metal edge would revolutionize ski design, Harry called upon Hartvig’s manufacturing skills and together they began working on a prototype. They developed a laminated metal ski, with a continuous steel edge spot-welded to a perforated steel bottom sheet and an <b>aluminum</b> <b>top</b> sheet. After three years of creating and refining, Hartvig, Harry and friend Ed Bjork were ready. In 1955, the first [...] "Hart" [...] metal-edged ski was introduced.|$|E

50|$|The SM465 {{features}} dual {{provisions for}} power take-offs. The 1988-91 versions have an <b>aluminum</b> <b>top</b> with improved shift feel. The 1986 pickup truck versions utilize a hydraulic clutch release, replacing a mechanical linkage in older versions. A common wear {{factor in the}} form of abuse leads to having to manually hold the gear selector in third. There have been three different output shafts for pickup trucks. Early four-wheel drive was a short 10 spline, late 4WD was long 32 spline, and all two-wheel drives were 35 spline. Early 4WDs came mated to New Process 205 transfer cases. The 1981 and later versions came with a New Process 208 if not a 205. New Process 241 was used behind the 465 starting in 1989 when it replaced the New Process 208 in the V-series trucks. The 465 was the only manual transmission available for V-series trucks (1987-1991).|$|E
5000|$|At {{about that}} time the city of Baltimore began taxing {{manufacturing}} inventories and equipment, and so in February 1957 Cheston Eshelman signed a ten-year contract with the Charles D. Briddell Company, makers of cutlery, to build Eshelman cars and other vehicles at its Crisfield, Maryland, facility. A decision was also made to upgrade the cars, and Eshelman introduced several versions of the new and more-streetworthy two-passenger [...] "Sportabout", a 675-pound enclosed model of the Adult Sport Car with a Model 23 Briggs and Stratton 8.4 horsepower single-cylinder engine. The 72-inch-long Eshelman Sportabout had more appurtenances, including electric starting and windshield wiper, reverse gear, directional signals, a 60-inch tall <b>aluminum</b> <b>top,</b> doors, spring suspension, foam upholstery, and a horn. All Sportabouts were painted red with silver doors and were shipped to buyers' addresses in wooden crates. Television star Bob Cummings (The Bob Cummings Show) became {{a spokesman for the}} Eshelman company in newspaper and magazine ads, and often featured Child Sport Cars on his programs. A new battery-powered child's car, the Model 200, was added, and thousands of the company's blue Mailster mail-delivery vehicles were seen on the streets of America, closely resembling the very similar Cushman mail carrier design.|$|E

30|$|To {{examine the}} current {{transport}} {{properties of the}} QDSC, series resistance (R s) of QDSC is estimated from {{the slope of the}} linear region of the dark J–V curve at the forward bias voltages between 0.5 and 1  V. Estimated R s is 1.63  kΩ and such high value of R s limits the fill factor and current output from the device. During J–V measurements, single <b>aluminum</b> <b>top</b> contact having an area of 1  mm 2 was probed resulting in increased R s decreasing the current collection. To confirm the effect of R s, top Al contacts were changed to finger-type Al contact with a total collection area of 14  mm 2. With finger-type contact device, V oc was 0.21  V, J sc was 0.665  mA cm− 2, FF was 31.4  % and R s was 31.25  Ω. After increasing the top Al contact area, value of R s was found decreased, resulting in increase of J sc and FF value for the cell. The relation of top contact area and cell performance describe the role R s played in modifying the J–V curve.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{behavior}} of a hydrogen atom adsorbed on aluminum nanowire based on density functional theory. In this study, we focus on the electronic structure, potential energy surface (PES), and quantum mechanical effects on hydrogen and deuterium atoms. The activation energy of the diffusion of a hydrogen atom to the axis direction is derived as 0. 19 eV from PES calculations. The probability density, which is calculated by including quantum effects, is localized on an <b>aluminum</b> <b>top</b> site in both cases of hydrogen and deuterium atoms of the ground state. In addition, some excited states are distributed between aluminum atoms {{on the surface of the}} nanowire. The energy difference between the ground state and these excited states are below 0. 1 eV, which is much smaller than the activation energy of PES calculations. Thus using these excited states, hydrogen and deuterium atoms may move to the axial direction easily.

[...] The optimal process for the ES 308 plastic container, supplied by Kings Plastic, with a double seemed pull <b>top</b> <b>aluminum</b> lid, {{was found to be}} 130 minutes at 83 °C. This process was developed for a fill weight of 180 g of crab meat and 47 g of 3 % brine. The slowest heating spot within the container was found to occur at a point 3. 0 cm below the <b>aluminum</b> pull <b>top</b> lid. Thermal penetration studies revealed the following heating and cooling parameters for this container and meat: jh = 1. 69 (₌ 0. 04), fh = 34. 74 (₌ 1. 04), jc = 1. 56 (₌ 0. 03), fc = 50. 53 (₌ 1. 73) [...] The 83. 0 °C upper temperature processing limit, for this plastic container, reduced the possible processing times. Reduced processing temperatures, from 83. 0 °C, caused disproportionally great increases in processing times which further resulted in increases of energy expenditure per container produced. The process 130 minutes at 83. 0 °C was found to be optimal from an energy expenditure point of view for this reason. [...] Nutritional quality did not show significant changes apart from some reductions in fatty acid content. The microbial quality from this process was shown to be more than adequate as the shelf life obtained was in excess of 12 months when held consistently at 2. 2 °C.
