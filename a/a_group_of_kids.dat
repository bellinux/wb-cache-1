25|$|Despite expectations, {{prior to}} and during the season a total of sevenUT players were {{suspended}} for various infractions. Brown said “I am extremely disappointed that four of our student-athletes have had issues with the law this summer. That is not reflective of the high standard of class, character and integrity we have established at Texas for many years. It’s a shame that these recent events have generated {{a great deal of}} negative attention, because I do think that overall, this is as good of <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> that I’ve ever coached. I think that will show over time.” The negative publicity was more extensive than in past instances but Mack Brown publicly supported the players while denouncing their actions.|$|E

25|$|The first {{official}} BMX sanctioning body was the National Bicycle Association (NBA) started by Ernie Alexander in 1972. Like Scot Breithaupt, he had motorcycle motocross in his background, and like Scot {{he was a}} promoter but a professional one with his American Cycle Enterprises (ACE). He was also a former Hollywood stunt man who promoted races at the famous Indian Dunes, built and managed by Walt James, where many movies and TV shows were filmed. In 1970 he noticed <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> trying to organize a bicycle race with their Schwinn Sting-Rays. Being familiar with motorcycle racing, he lent the kids a hand. He later opened the Yarnell track, a steep downhill course every bit as treacherous by today's standards as Scot Breithaupt's BUMS track—if not more so. In 1972 he created the National Bicycle Association, modeled on the existing American Motorcycle Association (AMA). It was Mr. Alexander who built a truly nation-spanning professional sanctioning body for BMX.|$|E
500|$|The Sunday page of Winnie Winkle was {{the first}} American comic {{published}} in a Yugoslavian daily newspaper, Jutarnji list from Zagreb.

Andy tells his co-workers that he stepped in when a [...] "gang" [...] harassed Pam, and Pam plays along out of gratitude to Andy. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) arranges a meeting {{in the conference room}} to discuss self-defense. Andy is then humiliated when Tiffany is brought in by her mother (Tig Notaro) and half-apologizes to him and Pam. Kelly asks Toby to demonstrate how to defend oneself when being attacked by a girl, and begins physically harassing him; Andy steps in between the two to break the fight up, resulting in his other eye being blackened. The rest of the office laughs but shuts up when Andy points out he got hit twice because he defended other people who were being attacked. The episode concludes with Andy noting that he took a bunch of pain medication, drank a bottle of wine, and took his pants off, thus greatly improving his feelings as the day ends.|$|E

500|$|According to MTV, {{the initial}} concept {{for the music}} video was to portray Spears {{on the porch of}} a beachfront home {{watching}} <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> having fun, prompting flashbacks about her former boyfriend. The video begins with Spears going to the telescope, and Spears is looking through a telescope. The concept was later changed a man and a dog walk on the beach, portraying the singer as the girl next door, watching her love interest, played by model Chad Cole, from afar. The beach location was kept, and the music video intercuts with scenes of Spears' dancing on the Paradise Cove pier with her dancers dressed all in beach-friendly white attire, then Spears sits near a car. A writer of Rolling Stone noted the video is best known for [...] "purifying the sexy persona Spears introduced in the '... Baby One More Time' video", while describing it as [...] "a virginal Britney in a long, flowing white dress (and other demure outfits) gazes at a clean-cut boy on the beach, then she walks on the balcony with a pink ball, then does some chaste choreography that features her dancers forming a heart while she sings that she only wants to [...] "hold you tight, treat you right." [...] Spears is sitting on a picnic blanket wishing she was there with him. She leaves alone." [...] On February 20, 2012, behind the scenes footage of the music video leaked online.|$|E

2500|$|The Junk Yard Band {{started out}} in 1980 as <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> (as young as nine) from the Barry Farm, Washington, D.C. projects.

2500|$|The scandal devastated {{what had}} {{consistently}} been a top 20-ranked {{team that had}} recently contended for the national championship.

The new team was, as the Associated Press later reported, [...] "scared, almost terrified" [...] to leave the locker room to play number one-ranked Notre Dame on November 11, 1989. They lost that game 59-6, although Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz reportedly went easy on them.

[...] Eventual Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware threw six touchdown passes against SMU in the first half, and David Klingler added four more in the second half even with the game long out of reach.

[...] Thirteen players needed knee surgery after the 1989 season, compared to the normal three or four. Gregg, who left coaching to become SMU's athletic director in 1991, said years later, [...] "I never coached <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> that had more courage.
