50|$|Capripoxviruses infect {{primarily}} sheep, goat, and cattle, but {{strains of}} capripoxviruses {{are difficult to}} distinguish between. Capripoxvirus strains are often recognized by how the main target host responds. They cannot be distinguished using routine laboratory tests such as virus neutralisation test, immunofluorescence test or <b>agar</b> <b>gel</b> <b>immunodiffusion</b> <b>test.</b> They, however, can be isolated by using the HinDill restriction enzymes to separate their DNA. Comparisons of fragmented DNA sequences from different strains showed that all capripoxviruses have a very similar nucleotide sequence homology. Strains were also proven to not all be host-specific. All Capripoxvirus DNA are double-stranded with lengths of around 150 kbp. Strains from goatpox and sheeppox share at least 147 genes; LSDV have an extra 9 genes that are non-functional in GTPV and SPPV. Strains of GTPV, SPPV, and LSDV generally have genome identities similar by at least 96%.|$|E

40|$|Because {{relatively}} few caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) -infected animals exhibit clinical signs of illness, {{efforts to control}} and eradicate this virus will depend heavily on a sensitive diagnostic test {{that can be easily}} carried out. The currently utilized tests are of limited usefulness because of relatively low sensitivity or because of incomplete cross-reactivity of goat sera with heterologous test antigens. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with purified CAEV antigen and biotin-avidin amplification steps was therefore developed and compared with a radioimmunoassay (RIA) against CAEV p 28. Of over 500 sera tested, there was 99 % concordance between the two tests. On the other hand, 23 of 24 sera obtained from animals with clinical signs of disease that were negative by <b>agar</b> <b>gel</b> <b>immunodiffusion</b> <b>test</b> (with ovine progressive pneumonia virus antigen) were positive by ELISA and RIA.
