25|$|The {{foreground}} {{depicts the}} saints' funerals. Bernardino lies on a catafalque, which, {{thanks to its}} oblique perspective, increases {{the depth of the}} scene and the interaction between the characters. Friars, pilgrims and other common people are approaching the corpse to pay homage; on the sides are two richly dressed characters, identified as Riccomanno Bufalini (on the left, with a fur-lined hood and the gloves) and a member of his family. The remaining characters are used to portray a series of miracles attributed to Bernardino during his life: the healing of a blind man(who hints <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes),</b> the resurrection of someone possessed, the healing of a dead newborn, the healing of Lorenzo di Niccol√≤ da Prato, wounded by a bull, and the pacification of the Umbrian families.|$|E
2500|$|Gable did {{not want}} to shed tears for the scene after Rhett {{inadvertently}} causes Scarlett to miscarry their second child. Olivia de Havilland made him cry, later commenting, [...] "...Oh, he would not do it. He would not! Victor (Fleming) tried everything with him. He tried to attack him on a professional level. We had done it without him weeping several times and then we had one last try. I said, 'You can do it, I know you can do it and you will be wonderful...' Well, by heaven, just before the cameras rolled, you could see the tears come up <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and he played the scene unforgettably well. He put his whole heart into it." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{returned}} {{to fight the}} third and last by-election in County Carlow, having lost {{the support of the}} Freeman's Journal when its proprietor Edmund Dwyer-Gray defected to the anti-Parnellites. At one point quicklime was thrown <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> by a hostile crowd in Castlecomer, County Kilkenny. [...] Parnell continued the exhausting campaigning. One loss followed another but he looked to the next general election in 1892 to restore his fortunes. On 27 September, he addressed a crowd in pouring rain at Creggs, subjecting himself to a severe soaking. On the difficult campaign trail, his health continuously deteriorated; furthermore he had kidney disease. [...] Parnell fought on furiously but he was a dying man at age 45.|$|E
60|$|He felt <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> with <b>his</b> trunk; then, uttering {{a scream}} of pain, wheeled round and rushed away.|$|R
6000|$|Hugh gazed for {{a moment}} <b>at</b> <b>his</b> face, on which there was a strange, unearthly smile; and <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> which sparkled brightly; and {{interposing}} {{between him and the}} Ordinary, gruffly whispered to the latter: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I confess I am of Mrs. Waterbrook's opinion,' said Mr. Waterbrook, with <b>his</b> wine-glass <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> 'Other {{things are}} all very well in their way, but give me Blood!' ...|$|R
60|$|Rankine steadied {{himself against}} the rail, with his glasses <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Barnaby looked curiously <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and {{touching}} {{them with his}} fingers, as an inquisitive child might, led him towards the house.|$|E
60|$|He stopped. She {{looked at}} his face, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> now eager and eloquent with the things that never shaped {{themselves}} into words.|$|E
60|$|Noah {{stopped to}} make no reply, but started off <b>at</b> <b>his</b> fullest speed; and very much it {{astonished}} {{the people who were}} out walking, to see a charity-boy tearing through the streets pell-mell, with no cap on his head, and a clasp-knife <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Cutts went {{black in}} the face a'most and stared at Bob Pretty as if 'e was going to eat 'im, and Bob stared back, looking fust at the keeper's nose and then <b>at</b> <b>'is</b> <b>eyes</b> and mouth, and then <b>at</b> <b>'is</b> nose agin.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I don't understand; I don't see my way,' Twemlow stammers, as he falters {{over the}} book with <b>his</b> glass <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> 'How warn her father, and not tell him? Tell him how much? Tell him how little? I--I--am getting lost.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You bet!" [...] {{said the}} blacksmith, with deep reverence. [...] "Look at his nose! look <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes!</b> Intellect? Just {{a battery of}} it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then the doctor--who {{must also}} have known that he was dead--felt his pulse and his heart, and looked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and {{declared}} that he was dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My lord,' John Grueby answered, '{{look at his}} dress, look <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> look at his restless way, {{hear him}} cry [...] "No Popery!" [...] Mad, my lord.' ...|$|E
60|$|Carmina looked <b>at</b> him. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> dropped before her, in {{confusion}} and shame.|$|R
6000|$|On one {{of these}} occasions, when they had both been {{perfectly}} quiet for a long time, and Mr Dombey only knew {{that the child was}} awake by occasionally glancing <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> where the bright fire was sparkling like a jewel, little Paul broke silence thus: ...|$|R
60|$|Mr Bickersdyke, {{except for}} a slight {{deepening}} of the colour of his complexion, gave no sign of having seen them. He puffed away <b>at</b> <b>his</b> cigar, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed on the ceiling.|$|R
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. No. Thank {{you very}} much. No. Nothing. The heat. [He punctuates with sniffs, and dabs with his {{handkerchief}} <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and nose.] Hay fever.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Hardyman {{seems to}} {{understand}} animals," [...] he said. [...] "He lifted the dog's eyelid and looked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{and then he}} told us the bath was useless." ...|$|E
60|$|The Dominie then pressed forward, grinned, chuckled, made a diabolical {{sound in}} {{attempting}} to whistle, and finally, unable to stifle his emotions, ran away to empty the feelings of his heart <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Have {{you brought}} your hatchet, Miss Brougham? If you have, you're {{just in time}} to join in the {{massacre}} of the innocents. Sellers has been smiting my child and cat hip and thigh. Look <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> There! Did you see it flash then? He's on the warpath again.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{lifted his}} head and looked <b>at</b> her, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> dim with tears, his lips quivering.|$|R
60|$|The child obeyed <b>at</b> once. <b>His</b> <b>eyes,</b> however, were longingly fixed {{upon the}} book of engravings.|$|R
60|$|If Mr. Snagsby could {{withstand}} {{his little}} woman's look as it enters <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{the windows of}} his soul, and searches the whole tenement, he were other than the man he is. He cowers and droops.|$|E
6000|$|The girl's face changed. She cast a half frightened, half {{questioning}} glance <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and then}} around the darkening aisle. [...] "If we're going to quarrel, Jack," [...] she said hurriedly, [...] "don't let's do it BEFORE FOLKS." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'It is he, the man himself...' I {{nodded and}} Tomassov {{went on in}} a tone of anguish: 'Yes, he! Brilliant, accomplished, envied by men, loved by that woman--this horror--this miserable thing that cannot die. Look <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> It's terrible.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{therefore}} I {{want you}} to be Oswald's wife;--because I know that you would fight for him. It is not true that he is a--drunkard. Look <b>at</b> <b>his</b> hand, which is as steady as yours. Look <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> Is there a sign of it? He has been drunk, once or twice, perhaps,--and has done fearful things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tain't no religion," [...] said Slocum emphatically; [...] "it's jest pure fas'nation. Did ye look <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye?</b> It's like a rattlesnake's, {{and them}} wimmin are like birds. They're frightened of him--but they hev to do jest what he 'wills' 'em. That's how he skeert the widder the other day." ...|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> me. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> had {{something}} strange in them, so that I felt rather uncomfortable.|$|R
6000|$|... "What was that?" [...] said Mr. Lyddell looking up, and Marian, startled, yet {{glad to have}} {{attracted}} his notice, repeated what she had said. [...] "Did not Wells look <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> last winter?" [...] he said, turning to his wife.|$|E
60|$|Saying this he {{advanced}} to the first guard in the line, and, throwing himself into a vigorously picturesque attitude, pointed with two fingers of the right hand <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> trembling violently the while, {{as though he was}} exerting some tremendous but subtle energy.|$|E
60|$|Kells vouchsafed {{no reply}} to this and, turning away, {{continued}} his tasks. Joan {{had a close}} look <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and again she was startled. They were not like eyes, but just gray spaces, opaque openings, with nothing visible behind, yet with something terrible there.|$|E
60|$|The old gun-man {{looked at}} Jane and then <b>at</b> <b>his</b> clawlike hands and then <b>at</b> Fay. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> lost their shadow {{and began to}} twinkle.|$|R
60|$|The {{prisoner}} looked bewildered, for {{the failing}} of nature rendered that obscure {{which was once}} so evident to his mind. After gazing long <b>at</b> <b>his</b> son, <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> wandered {{between him and the}} wall, and he smiled childishly.|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> her, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{dark and}} swift, {{and he saw}} her revulsion. He did not answer her question.|$|R
