The AFV also drafted many of Diệm's speeches, making sure that there were analogies made between South Vietnam and various events in American history, {{so that he would}} make <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>impression</b> on the American public and decision-makers. For this purpose they employed the services of the political consultancy firm Harold Oram.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the local}} Canton {{officials}} watched the Portuguese and their ships closely, once the provincial authorities arrived at Canton they greeted the Portuguese {{with a warm}} reception, providing them comfortable lodgings and had their trade goods brought ashore. The Chinese became suspicious once again of Andrade, this time for being a spy, when he sent a ship along the Fujian coast to look for further trade prospects, but he left <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>impression</b> when he gave the order that any locals who might be harmed by a Portuguese should seek him for redress. Besides exploring Fujian, Andrade sent one of his captains named Jorge de Mascarenhas to explore the Ryukyu Islands after he heard of their beauty while stationed in Malacca.|$|E
5|$|As {{commander}} of U.S. {{forces in the}} Philippines and Formosa, Radford accompanied President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower on his three-day trip to Korea in December 1952. Eisenhower was looking for an exit strategy for the stalemated and unpopular war, and Radford suggested threatening China with attacks on its Manchurian bases {{and the use of}} nuclear weapons. This view was shared by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and UNC Commander General Mark W. Clark, but had not been acted on when the armistice came in July 1953, {{at a time when the}} Chinese were struggling with domestic unrest. Still, Radford's frankness during the trip and his knowledge of Asia made <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>impression</b> on Eisenhower, who nominated Radford to be his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.|$|E
5|$|By this stage, Yorkshire {{regarded}} Yardley as {{the heir}} to Brian Sellers as captain, and the England Test selectors also began to prepare him to assume the England captaincy. At {{the end of the}} 1938 season, Yardley was chosen to tour South Africa with MCC as vice-captain to Wally Hammond. He made a good start to the tour, scoring centuries in his first two innings, both surpassing his previous highest score. Wisden noted that he made <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>impression</b> on spectators in these early matches. In his fourth match, he captained the MCC in Hammond's absence for the first time. When Len Hutton was injured in a tour match and missed the first Test, Yardey made his debut but scored just seven runs in a total of 422 and did not bat in the second innings. Hutton returned for the second match, and the successes of other batsmen meant that Yardley was not required in the other Tests on the tour. However, he scored a third century when he captained the MCC against Border.|$|E

5|$|Charles met Frederick Kemp, a {{land agent}} newly arrived in Poulton {{from his native}} Essex, and {{introduced}} him to his brother, {{who was on the}} lookout for a steward or agent. Kemp, well-dressed and charming, made <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>impression</b> on Hesketh, who employed him immediately. At the meeting of the railway committee Hesketh put forward a persuasive argument. Despite opposition from the Lytham contingent the committee decided that Rossall Point was the best place for the railway terminus to be built, and the Railway and Port Company was formed. In the early 19th century it was thought that steam locomotives would be unable to negotiate hilly terrain, and that Lake District hills like Shap Fell would prevent the railway from reaching Scotland. The Fylde terminus would have even more importance than Hesketh had hoped, providing a sea link for passengers from London to travel on to Scotland. Initially Hesketh had considered naming his new town New Liverpool or Wyreton, but after changing his name to Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831 he decided to call it Fleetwood. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he readily handed over financial management of the project to his manager, Frederick Kemp.|$|E
5|$|On 4 April 1940, Robertson {{joined the}} Second AIF himself, with {{the rank of}} brigadier, and was {{allocated}} the AIF service number VX20321. He was appointed to command the 19th Infantry Brigade, which was then being formed from units made surplus by {{the reduction of the}} 6th Division from 12 infantry battalions to nine. All three of its battalions, the 2/4th, 2/8th and 2/11th Infantry Battalions, were initially commanded by over-age officers, but the commander of the 2/4th was replaced by Ivan Dougherty in August. Initially, Dougherty received a cool reception from Robertson, who was disappointed at being unable to select his own battalion commanders, but Dougherty soon made such <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>impression</b> that when Robertson went on leave in October 1940 he recommended that Dougherty act as brigade commander, {{despite the fact that he}} was the youngest and most junior of Robertson's battalion chiefs.|$|E
5|$|On June 22, 2010, {{the town}} of Lyndhurst put forward a {{proposal}} to buy the station depots at both Kingsland and Lyndhurst stations. The mayor of Lyndhurst, Richard DiLascio, said that the stations have seen better days and New Jersey Transit {{has no interest in}} renovating both buildings. Design plans for Kingsland station look towards a new coffee shop, after repairing and renovating the building. The station would also be converted from its old subway tile to a newer retro look for the building, paid for by leasing the building. Because an average of 440 to over 1,000 people use the Kingsland station daily, it would look better for {{the town of}} Lyndhurst to make <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>impression</b> on the riders. Asof 2012, the station house was unoccupied. The town of Lyndhurst has requested that NJT lease the building to the municipality so that it might be renovated and brought into use as a way to revitalize the immediate vicinity.|$|E

Pam and Jim are expecting their second child, Phillip, {{at the start of}} the season, to coincide with Fischer's real life pregnancy. Angela is pregnant with her first son, also named Philip, with State Senator Robert Lipton (although it is implied that Dwight Schrute is actually the child's biological father). Darryl starts falling for new warehouse foreman Val. Dwight is tasked with traveling to Tallahassee, Florida in order to assist Sabre Special Projects Manager Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) in launching a chain of retail stores, along with Jim, Ryan, Stanley, Erin, and new office temp Cathy Simms. Cathy is also revealed to have ulterior motives for the trip, as she intends to seduce Jim, but fails. Robert later kills the retail store project, and Erin decides to stay in Florida as an elderly woman's live-in helper. Andy goes to Florida and wins back Erin, but this allows Nellie to claim the manager position as her own. Robert tells Andy that he has been demoted back to a salesman, but he refuses to accept the news, which causes him to be fired. Andy becomes motivated to begin a Dunder Mifflin comeback and joins with former CFO, David Wallace, to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre, putting Sabre completely out of business and giving Andy the manager position once again.|$|E

The two decide to cut a demo with Broadway veteran Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) which Ellis videotapes. He sends the tape to his mother who uploads it online. Julia and Tom grow angry towards this, fearing that theater critic Michael Riedel will write a harsh review of the song. They decide to fire Ellis, until they learn Riedel loved the song and approved {{of the idea of}} a Marilyn Monroe musical. They rehire Ellis and they quickly receive interest from producer Eileen Rand (Anjelica Huston), who brings on director Derek Wills (Jack Davenport), who had a strained relationship with Tom. Derek demands to audition for the main role while Tom wants Ivy to play Marilyn. Meanwhile, a waitress named Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee), who came from a small town in Iowa to make her theatrical dreams a reality hears the original demo song and decides to audition. Karen makes <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>impression</b> on the producers, leading to both Karen and Ivy getting a callback. Later on, Derek calls Karen to have a meeting at his loft late at night.|$|E
5|$|Yardley {{was born}} in Royston, near Barnsley, on 19 March 1915 to a family with no real {{background}} in cricket. He was sent to St Peter's, York, where he made <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>impression</b> as a cricketer, being in the school team for five years from 1930 and captain in his final two years. In 1933, his first season in charge, he scored 973 runs {{at an average of}} 88.45, scoring three centuries in consecutive innings. He headed the bowling averages, with 40 wickets at 11.90 runs per wicket. His form that season saw him selected for the match between Young Amateurs and Young Professionals at Lord's Cricket Ground, in which Yardley scored 189 in his first representative match, playing against his future England team-mate Denis Compton. In 1934, Yardley played in two further representative matches at Lord's, for The Rest against Lord's Schools, and for Public Schools against The Army, making 117, the first century in the fixture for Public Schools, and 63. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack later cited these successes as a demonstration of his ability to perform well on important occasions. While still at school, he {{came to the attention of}} Yorkshire County Cricket Club, playing for the Yorkshire Colts side and receiving coaching from George Hirst. He played for Yorkshire Second XI once in 1932, twice in 1933 and twice in 1934.|$|E
