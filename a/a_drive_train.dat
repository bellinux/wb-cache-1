2500|$|Ontario surpassed Michigan in car production, {{assembling}} 2.696million {{vehicles in}} 2004. Ontario has Chrysler plants in Windsor and Bramalea, two GM plants in Oshawa {{and one in}} Ingersoll, a Honda assembly plant in Alliston, Ford plants in Oakville and St. Thomas and Toyota assembly plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. However, {{as a result of}} steeply declining sales, in 2005, General Motors announced massive layoffs at production facilities across North America including two large GM plants in Oshawa and <b>a</b> <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> facility in St. Catharines resulting in 8,000 job losses in Ontario alone. In 2006, Ford Motor Company announced between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs phased until 2012; Ontario was spared the worst, but job losses were announced for the St Thomas facility and the Windsor Casting plant. However, these losses will be offset by Ford's recent announcement of a hybrid vehicle facility slated to begin production in 2007 at its Oakville plant and GM's re-introduction of the Camaro which will be produced in Oshawa. On December 4, 2008 Toyota announced the grand opening of the RAV4 plant in Woodstock, and Honda also has plans to add an engine plant at its facility in Alliston. Despite these new plants coming online, Ontario has not yet fully recovered following massive layoffs caused by the global recession; its unemployment rate was 7.3% in May 2013, compared to 8.7 percent in January 2010 and approximately 6% in 2007. In September 2013, the Ontario government committed CAD$70.9million to the Ford plant in Oakville, while the federal government committed CAD$71.1mn, to secure 2,800 jobs. The province has lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs in the decade from 2003, and the Bank of Canada noted that [...] "while the energy and mining industries have benefitted from these movements, the pressure on the manufacturing sector has intensified, since many firms in this sector were already dealing with growing competition from low-cost economies such as China." ...|$|E

SNM asked the help of the three universities of technology in the Netherlands to develop a sustainable car for the future. This first phase of the c,mm,n project is called c,mm,n 1. 0 and many aspects of the c,mm,n 1. 0 car became research topics for graduate students. The results of c,mm,n 1. 0 were presented at the 2007 AutoRAI. In November 2007, the c,mm,n 2. 0 project was launched. SNM plans to make a new presentation of c,mm,n 2. 0 on the 2009 edition of the AutoRAI with the desire to show a driveable prototype. To assist SNM in this task, this report presents <b>a</b> new <b>drive</b> <b>train</b> option which is analyzed and compared to the two c,mm,n 1. 0 <b>drive</b> <b>trains.</b> Additionally, the vehicle dynamics of the c,mm,n vehicle are analyzed.
