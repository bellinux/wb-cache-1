In January 2010, when <b>accumulated</b> <b>losses</b> already exceeded NT$70billion, THSRC signed a government-guaranteed refinancing deal in which eight government-dominated banks provided NT$382billion at lower interest rates and longer maturity. The government also approved the company's new variable depreciation charge.|$|E
5|$|The 2014–15 season {{opened with}} the Devils' roster {{suffering}} with injuries, and consequently the team <b>accumulated</b> <b>losses.</b> On December 26, Peter DeBoer {{was fired from}} the head coach position. To replace him, Lamoriello invested in two head coaches, former Devils player Scott Stevens (who had been DeBoer's assistant for two years) and Adam Oates, with Lamoriello himself supervising the team during the first months. The Devils finished the season as the sixth-worst team in the League, 20 points away from a playoff spot and with just one victory in the last 11 games.|$|E
5|$|The new Holden WB {{commercial}} vehicles and the Statesman WB limousines {{were introduced in}} 1980. However, the designs, based on the HQ and updated HJ, HX and HZ models from the 1970s were less competitive than similar models in Ford's lineup. Thus, Holden abandoned those vehicle classes altogether in 1984. Sales of the Commodore also fell, {{with the effects of}} the 1979 energy crisis lessening, {{and for the first time}} the Commodore lost ground to the Ford Falcon. Sales in other segments also suffered when competition from Ford intensified, and other Australian manufacturers: Mitsubishi, Nissan and Toyota gained market share. When released in 1982, the Camira initially generated good sales, which later declined because buyers considered the 1.6-litre engine underpowered, and the car's build and ride quality below-average. The Camira lasted just seven years, and contributed to Holden's <b>accumulated</b> <b>losses</b> of over A$500million by the mid-1980s.|$|E

25|$|By {{the mid-1970s}} Pan Am had racked up $364million of <b>accumulated</b> <b>losses</b> over a 10-year period, and its debts {{approached}} $1billion. This threatened the airline with bankruptcy. Former American Airlines {{vice president of}} operations, William T. Seawell, who had replaced Najeeb Halaby as Pan Am president in 1972, began implementing a turnaround strategy: trimming the network by 25%, slashing the 40,000-strong workforce by 30% and cutting wages, introducing stringent economies and rescheduling debt, and reducing {{the size of the}} fleet. These measures aided by the use of tax-loss credits enabled Pan Am to avert financial collapse and return to profitability in 1977.|$|E

25|$|After the {{departure}} of Kincaid-Smith, the company ceased to manage its estates actively, and by 1948 they were described as having many tenants who produced all its crops, as the owner was merely their broker. Magomero produced 500,000 to 700,000 pounds of tobacco a year, but the company paid badly for this, and many tenants preferred to grow maize to sell in local markets, avoiding sales through the company. In 1945, A L Bruce Estates Ltd announced it wished to sell Magomero. A government survey of the estate showed {{that it had been}} badly managed, deforested, and its soil and grassland abused. Nevertheless, the Governor felt it was necessary to buy the land through negotiation with the company, not by compulsory purchase. Bruce Estates wanted a figure that would wipe out its <b>accumulated</b> <b>losses</b> since 1925, but this was considered excessive, and in 1947 the company provisionally agreed to sell Magomero to a private buyer at a price of £80,000.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new model for the {{dynamics}} of the aggregate credit portfolio loss. The model is Markovian in two dimensions with the state variables being the total <b>accumulated</b> <b>loss</b> Lt and the stochastic default intensity λt. The dynamics of the default intensity are governed by the equation dλt = κ(ρ(Lt, t) − λt) dt + σ √ λtdWt. The function ρ depends both on time t and <b>accumulated</b> <b>loss</b> Lt, providing sufficient freedom to calibrate the model to a generic distribution of loss. We develop a computationally efficient method for model calibration to the market of synthetic single tranche CDOs. The method is based on the Markovian projection technique which reduces the full model to a one-step Markov chain having the same marginal distributions of loss. We show that once the intensity function of the effective Markov chain consistent with the loss distribution implied by the tranches is found, the function ρ can be recovered with a very moderate computational effort. Because our model is Markovian and has low dimensionality, it offers a convenient framework for the pricing of dynamic credit instruments, such as options on indices and tranches, by backward induction. We calibrate the model to a set of recent market quotes on CDX index tranches and apply it to the pricing of tranche options...|$|R
