25|$|India ranks second {{worldwide}} in farm output. Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry, logging and fishing accounted for 17% of the GDP and employed 49% {{of its total}} workforce in 2014. As the Indian economy has diversified and grown, agriculture's contribution to GDP has steadily declined from 1951 to 2011, yet {{it is still the}} country's largest employment source and a significant piece of its overall socio-economic development. Crop-yield-per-unit-area of all crops has grown since 1950, due to the special emphasis placed on agriculture in the five-year plans and steady improvements in irrigation, technology, application of modern agricultural practices and provision of agricultural credit and subsidies since the Green Revolution in India. However, international comparisons reveal the <b>average</b> <b>yield</b> in India is generally 30% to 50% of the highest <b>average</b> <b>yield</b> in the world.

25|$|When {{productivity}} {{declined in}} the low-clay soils of northern Thailand, farmers initially responded by adding organic matter from termite mounds, but this was unsustainable in the long-term. Scientists experimented with adding bentonite, one of the smectite family of clays, to the soil.

Supplementing the farmer's usual practice with a single application of 200kg bentonite per rai (6.26 rai = 1 hectare) resulted in an <b>average</b> <b>yield</b> increase of 73%.

50|$|Normal yield is an {{agricultural}} term {{referring to the}} <b>average</b> historic <b>yield</b> established for a particular farm or area.

2500|$|The Green Revolution popularized {{the use of}} {{conventional}} hybridization to sharply increase yield by creating [...] "high-yielding varieties". For example, <b>average</b> <b>yields</b> of corn (maize) in the US have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001. Similarly, worldwide <b>average</b> wheat <b>yields</b> have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American <b>average</b> wheat <b>yields</b> are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, and Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the <b>average</b> wheat <b>yield</b> {{in countries such as}} France is over 8 t/ha. Variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, growth control to avoid lodging).|$|R

25|$|Even as America's westward {{expansion}} allowed over 400 {{million acres}} (1,600,000km²) of new land {{to be put}} under cultivation, between 1870 and 1910 the number of Americans involved in farming or farm labor dropped by a third. New farming techniques and agricultural mechanization facilitated both processes. Cyrus McCormick's reaper (invented in 1834) allowed farmers to quadruple their harvesting efficiency by replacing hand labor with a mechanical device. John Deere invented the steel plow in 1837, keeping the soil from sticking to the plow and {{making it easier to}} farm in the rich prairies of the Midwest. The harvester, self-binder, and combine allowed even greater efficiencies: wheat farmers in 1866 achieved an <b>average</b> <b>yield</b> of 9.9 bushels per acre but by 1898 yields had increased to 15.3 bushels per acre even as the total area had tripled.|$|E
25|$|There are differing {{views on}} how many schools a student should apply to. Several reports suggest that {{applying}} to too many schools caused unnecessary stress and expense, and hampers a student from targeting applications to a few select schools. But other advisors suggest that applying to more schools increases overall chances for acceptance. Mamlet and VanDeVelde suggest applying to eight to ten schools is best, and that applying to too many schools is counterproductive. There are reports that {{the average number of}} schools that students are applying to has been increasing, perhaps because of greater use of the Common Application. In 2008, applications to Harvard University had increased to a record number at 27,278, a 19% increase from the year before.

25|$|Based on {{the river}} basin water data {{available}} from the year 1934 to 1971 (44 years back data), the tribunal estimated the average water yield in the total river basin as 767 TMC which corresponds to 47% dependability. The live storage capacity available in the river basin is nearly 310 TMC which is 40.5% of the <b>average</b> <b>yield.</b> The water used in the Cauvery delta in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry is nearly 280 TMC which is the tail end water use in the river basin and its regenerated water either goes to sea or outside the Cauvery basin. The total dissolved salt load generated in the basin is nearly 3.5 million metric tons per year. The estimated salinity or total dissolved salts (TDS) for the water available in Cauvery delta is 441 ppm which {{is close to the}} safe maximum permissible 500 ppm. There is no limit imposed by the tribunal for the ground water use in the river basin. The tribunal has also permitted the basin states to use all the excess water available in above normal water years. Moreover, the river basin population has reached 40 million in the year 2015 and the increasing per capita inorganic salts used/consumed in industrial, agriculture and residential sectors are enhancing the salt export requirements. When adequate salt export from the river basin is not taking place to the sea by forcing Cauvery delta to face water shortage, the water quality (salinity, pH, alkalinity, sodicity, etc.) available for Cauvery delta would deteriorate beyond the permissible limits impeding its sustainable productivity and its aquatic ecosystem conservation. Ultimately salt export criteria is the limitation for the water resources development in a river basin.|$|E

500|$|At {{the centre}} of Great Southern's {{operations}} were management investment schemes (referred to as MIS schemes). MIS schemes are a mechanism by which investors' funds are pooled {{to invest in a}} common business enterprise. A [...] "responsible entity" [...] (such as Great Southern) controls the routine administration of the investments. In primary production schemes such as those managed by Great Southern, investors are the growers of products (such as forestry plantations), with an agreement with the company to manage the investment [...] "to plant, establish and maintain the trees until they are harvested at maturity". Investors in Great Southern generally purchased lots (typically of 1 hectare) on land owned or leased by Great Southern. Thus investors owned the plantations, but the land assets belonged to the company. While investors owned individual woodlots, risks and returns were distributed across all investors in individual projects, with growers sharing [...] "the <b>average</b> <b>yield</b> at harvest for the entire Project...rather than the return from their individual woodlot". These were not high rates of return for the length of investment involved. Some of the schemes relied upon the rationale that investors would retire and therefore receive income from the scheme when their marginal tax rate was lower than at the time of initial investment. Based on this premise some schemes were claiming a rate of return after tax of eight to nine percent. Others suggested the schemes were a poor investment likely to achieve only six percent return.|$|E
500|$|We {{can also}} {{estimate}} {{the amount of}} land needed to produce this amount of grain, thanks to Wolfram Eberhard who [...] "estimates the <b>average</b> <b>yield</b> as being 1.0 to 1.5 shih per mu," [...] though Hsu notes that, [...] "Very high yields could reach as much as 6.4 hu per mu." [...] Swann gives 1 shi 石 (which she translates as [...] "picul" [...] with a weight of [...] "64 lbs. 8.8 oz.") as between 1 and 2 hu, {{depending on the type}} of grain. Based only on Eberhard’s yields and Swann’s range of conversion between shi and hu, a farmer would need between about 85 and 254 mu (between about 9.7 and 29 acres) in order to produce the 127 hu of grain Eberhard deems necessary to the subsistence of a family of five. Other scholars give other numbers, however. Hsu claims that 50 mu (about 5.7 acres) was in fact [...] "the acreage needed for subsistence living," [...] while Wang Zhongshu calculates that [...] "there was on the average 24.6 mou per family, or less than 6 mou per person (with each mou equivalent to 456 square m)." [...] Both Li Kui and Chao Cuo claimed that 100 mu was the amount of land required to support a family, though it should be noted that the amount of land denoted by the word mu had changed between Li Kui's time and Chao Cuo's.|$|E
