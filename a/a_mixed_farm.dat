40|$|<b>Mixed</b> <b>farming</b> {{systems have}} {{potential}} agronomic, environmental and socio-economic advantages over specialized farming systems. This paper attempts to quantify these advantages for the Dutch province Flevoland. <b>A</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> system at regional level {{is characterized by}} intensive cooperation between two or more specialized farms, each producing crop or animal products. To test the hypothesis that such <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> system might improve sustainability of agriculture in Flevoland, nutrient balances, labour requirements and labour income were quantified for a specialized arable farm, a specialized dairy farm and both combined into <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> system, exchanging land, labour and machinery. Scope for reduced biocide use in the <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> system was assessed in a qualitative way. In the <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> system, labour income per ha was 25 % higher. Seventy percent of this increase could be explained through higher yields per ha of the profitable crops ware potato (Solanum tuberosum) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris). The remaining 30 % resulted from lower costs, mainly through a better utilization of available labour. Differences between the combined nutrient balance of both specialized farms {{and that of the}} <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> system were small. Indications of reduced biocide use in the <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> system could not be found. It was concluded that in <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> system, it is possible to realize a higher income without increasing environmental pollution. Key factor is the ratio between animal and arable production, determining the extent to which crop rotations can be widened and the relative amounts of slurry that can be applied to grassland...|$|R

50|$|At {{first they}} settled in Kangarilla, but found the land at Willunga more fertile and moved again, {{founding}} <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>farm</b> while breeding sheep, dairy cattle and bullocks. At first the going was hard; their first livestock were expensive (the first 40 head of cattle which they purchased cost them from £16 to £20 each, and their horses from £65 to £95 per head), then recession hit and their progeny were virtually worthless and they were producing more butter than the market could bear, but then copper was found at Burra, and bullocks were in high demand so the brothers prospered. They dissolved their partnership and Thomas, who had received some instruction in architecture and bricklaying in England, built the Bush Inn at Willunga in 1840, and purchased Ashley Farm, {{where he and his}} wife (a daughter of Stephen Bastian) lived the rest of their lives.|$|E
30|$|The {{observed}} {{changes are}} associated with increasing human population and associated livelihood {{of most of the}} rural population that is dependent on <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>farming</b> system of crop production and livestock management.
