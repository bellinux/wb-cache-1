2500|$|Leet {{originated}} within {{bulletin board}} systems (BBS) in the 1980s, where having [...] "elite" [...] status on a BBS allowed a user <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>file</b> folders, games, and special chat rooms. [...] The Cult of the Dead Cow hacker collective has {{been credited with}} the original coining of the term, in their text-files of that era. [...] One theory {{is that it was}} developed to defeat text filters created by BBS or Internet Relay Chat system operators for message boards to discourage the discussion of forbidden topics, like cracking and hacking. Creative misspellings and ASCII-art-derived words were also a way to attempt to indicate one was knowledgeable about the culture of computer users. Once the reserve of hackers, crackers, and script kiddies, leet has since entered the mainstream. It is now also used to mock newbies, or newcomers, on web sites, or in gaming communities. Some consider emoticons and ASCII art, like smiley faces, to be leet, while others maintain that leet consists of only symbolic word encryption. More obscure forms of leet, involving the use of symbol combinations and almost no letters or numbers, continue to be used for its original purpose of encrypted communication. It is also sometimes used as a script language. Variants of leet have been used for censorship purposes for many years; for instance [...] "@$$" [...] (ass) and [...] "$#!+" [...] (shit) are frequently seen to make a word appear censored to the untrained eye but obvious to a person familiar with leet.|$|E

50|$|Others were novel, {{including}} protocols for printer spooling, copying disk packs, page-level remote <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>file</b> servers, name lookup, remote management, etc. (although some {{of these}} capabilities had been seen before, e.g. the ARPANET already made heavy use of remote management for controlling the Interface Message Processors which made it up).|$|E
5000|$|Ransomware — a malware {{program that}} {{prevents}} <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>files</b> and/or computer unless paid.|$|R
50|$|The {{archives}} {{have recently}} announced that they are severely restricting <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>files</b> from October 2008 onwards, {{as part of a}} comprehensive digitalization program that aims <b>to</b> restrict <b>access</b> only <b>to</b> digitized <b>files.</b>|$|R
50|$|NetWare 5 {{and above}} {{supported}} Novell NetStorage for Internet-based <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>files</b> stored within NetWare.|$|R
50|$|NFS/Share was InterCon's {{second most}} popular product and {{provided}} high-performance <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>file</b> servers using the NFS protocol. NFS was used widely in educational environments {{because it was}} the key file sharing system for Sun Microsystems's line of UNIX servers. NFS/Share's adoption mirrored that popularity, finding a home in many educational institutions and pre-press environments.|$|E
50|$|Many sites {{unable to}} link {{directly}} to the Internet created simple gateways for the transfer of electronic mail, the most important application of the time. Sites with only intermittent connections used UUCP or FidoNet and relied on the gateways between these networks and the Internet. Some gateway services went beyond simple mail peering, such as allowing <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>File</b> Transfer Protocol (FTP) sites via UUCP or mail.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} typical cluster filesystems, GPFS {{provides}} concurrent high-speed file access to applications executing on multiple nodes of clusters. It {{can be used}} with AIX 5L clusters, Linux clusters, on Microsoft Windows Server, or a heterogeneous cluster of AIX, Linux and Windows nodes. In addition to providing filesystem storage capabilities, GPFS provides tools for management and administration of the GPFS cluster and allows for shared <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>file</b> systems from remote GPFS clusters.|$|E

50|$|Signon {{and project}} IDs {{are also used}} <b>to</b> control <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>files</b> and <b>to</b> send e-mail.|$|R
50|$|Likewise {{developed}} a CIFS/SMB implementation (versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1 and NFS 3.0) back in 2009 {{that provided a}} multiprotocol, identity-aware platform for network <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>files</b> used in OEM storage products built on Linux/Unix based devices. The platform {{could be used for}} traditional NAS, Cloud Gateway, and Cloud Caching devices for providing secure <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>files</b> across a network. Likewise was purchased by EMC Isilon in 2012.|$|R
50|$|ExtremeZ-IP, an Apple Filing Protocol server from GroupLogic, Inc, (Arlington, Virginia, USA), runs on Windows {{operating}} systems enabling Mac clients to access files via the Apple Filing (AFP 3.3) protocol. Starting with version 8.0, the Network Reshare capability allows an ExtremeZ-IP server to proxy <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>file</b> shares on a secondary file server or NAS device such as NetApp or Isilon. ExtremeZ-IP also {{provides access to}} other Windows services such as printing, searching, file system archiving, distributed file system and volume shadow service.|$|E
50|$|Least {{privilege}} {{is often}} associated with privilege bracketing: that is, assuming necessary privileges at the last possible moment and dismissing them as soon as no longer strictly necessary, therefore ostensibly reducing fallout from erroneous code that unintentionally exploits more privilege than is merited. Least privilege has also been interpreted in the context of distribution of discretionary access control (DAC) permissions, for example asserting that giving user U read/write <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>file</b> F violates least privilege if U can complete his authorized tasks with only read permission.|$|E
5000|$|The {{wireless}} network is after all {{confined to a}} small geographical area. A computer connected to the Internet and having improper configurations or other security problems can be exploited by anyone {{from anywhere in the}} world, while only clients in a small geographical range can exploit an open wireless access point. Thus the exposure is low with an open wireless access point, and the risks with having an open {{wireless network}} are small. However, one should be aware that an open wireless router will give access to the local network, often including <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>file</b> shares and printers.|$|E
5000|$|Distributed {{file system}}, any file {{system that allows}} <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>files</b> from {{multiple}} hosts sharing via a computer network ...|$|R
50|$|For example, the Network File System is transparent, {{because it}} {{introduces}} the <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>files</b> stored remotely {{on the network}} in a way uniform with previous local <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a <b>file</b> system, so the user might even not notice it while using the folder hierarchy. The early File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is considerably less transparent, because it requires each user to learn how <b>to</b> <b>access</b> <b>files</b> through an ftp client.|$|R
5000|$|VMFSDriver: It enables {{read-only}} <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>files</b> and folders on partitions formatted in the Virtual Machine File System (VMFS) by VMware.|$|R
50|$|The {{practice}} of file sharing constitutes {{a breach of}} the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 if it is performed without the permission of a copyright holder. Courts in the UK routinely issue injunctions restricting <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>file</b> sharing information published on the Internet. The British Phonographic Industry represents the interests of British record companies and along with the British Video Association encourages UK governments to regulate and legislate to reduce copyright infringement. As a result, the Digital Economy Act was passed in 2010. Further legislation has been suggested, such as the 2014 proposal for a general law to prevent search engines from returning file-sharing websites as search results.|$|E
5000|$|NWLink IPX/SPX/NetBIOS Compatible Transport is Microsoft's {{implementation}} of the Novell IPX/SPX (Internetwork Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange) protocol stack. The Windows XP {{implementation of}} the IPX/SPX protocol stack adds NetBIOS support.The main function of NWLink is {{to act as a}} transport protocol to route packets through internetworks. By itself, the NWLink protocol does not allow you to access the data across the network. If you want to access NetWare File and Print Services, you must install NWLink and Client Services for NetWare (software that works at the upper layers of the OSI model to allow <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>File</b> and Print services).One advantage of using NWLink is that is easy to install and configure.|$|E
5000|$|A new {{interface}} {{referred to}} as the Backstage view is included in all Office 2010 apps and replaces the Office menu that was introduced in Office 2007. The Backstage view is designed to facilitate <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>file</b> management tasks, including compatibility, metadata, permission, printing, and sharing tasks, and to consolidate them within a single location. The term [...] "backstage" [...] refers to the area behind the stage in a theatre where behind the scenes activities and preparations commence—accordingly, the backstage view in Office is an interface dedicated to document activities and preparations prior to saving or sharing. The Backstage view consists of both a left-hand navigation pane and an adjacent main pane. The navigation pane includes a series of vertically arranged common commands such as commands to open or save files, and tabs that, when opened, expose file management tasks and contextual information within the main pane. A customizable number of recently opened documents can also be displayed within the navigation pane.|$|E
50|$|File servers {{generally}} {{offer some}} form of system security <b>to</b> limit <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>files</b> <b>to</b> specific users or groups. In large organizations, this is a task usually delegated to {{what is known as}} directory services such as openLDAP, Novell's eDirectory or Microsoft's Active Directory.|$|R

5000|$|Office 2010 {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} release, with particular praise {{devoted to the}} modified ribbon and the new Backstage view. Laptop Mag rated the suite 4 out of 5 stars, referring to it as “the best Office suite yet” {{because of the new}} customization options provided by the ribbon, the new multimedia editing capabilities, a new option to share presentations online via PowerPoint, and app response times; Microsoft's decision to include OneNote in all retail versions of Office 2010 also received high praise. PC Magazine also rated the suite 4 out of 5 stars for similar reasons; the inclusion of the ribbon in all apps was viewed favorably because it enhances consistency and usability, and the Backstage view was praised for simplifying <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>file</b> management and printing options. However, PC Magazine expressed dissatisfaction with the [...] "intrusive" [...] default auto formatting options in Word; the lack of an upgrade edition or pricing for users of a previous version of Office; and the stability of Office apps. Nevertheless, Office 2010 was regarded as a [...] "dazzlingly attractive upgrade” that received the magazine's Editors' Choice and Best of the Year 2010 accolades. Office 2010 also received positive reviews from Alphr, PC Advisor, PC World, and TechRadar.|$|E

She began as a courier and progressed to more complicated missions behind enemy lines including reporting on airfield locations, German mines and antiaircraft and camouflaged emplacements along the shores of the Mediterranean. She saved American parachutists from capture at drop zones and helped Jewish families escape to Spain.
