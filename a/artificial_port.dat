25|$|Arriving {{first on}} D-Day itself were the Bombardons {{followed}} {{a day later}} by the first blockship. The first Phoenix was sunk on 9 June and the Gooseberry was finished by 11 June. By 18 June two piers and four pier heads were working. Though this harbour was abandoned in late June (see below), the beach continued {{to be used for}} landing vehicles and stores using Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs). Using this method, the Americans were able to unload a higher tonnage of supplies than at Arromanches. Salvageable parts of the <b>artificial</b> <b>port</b> were sent to Arromanches to repair the Mulberry there.|$|E

25|$|Once German commanders {{assessed}} the Allied assault at Normandy {{as the primary}} invasion, they sought to limit the lodgment while they prepared a counter-offensive. To preserve naval assets, the Cherbourg-based German E-boats were transferred to Saint-Malo. Four destroyers from Brest made for Cherbourg to follow the E-boats, but they were sunk or disabled. By June 14, the Germans were attempting to deny the Allies use of Cherbourg's major port facility by blocking, mining and demolishing its harbor. The violent English Channel storm that thrashed apart the <b>artificial</b> <b>port</b> Mulberry A raged until June 22. Logistic movement ashore was temporarily crippled, and the Allies desperately needed Cherbourg's port in their possession.|$|E

50|$|A {{major issue}} {{was how to}} supply the {{invasion}} army with {{the tens of thousands}} of tons of materiel it would need after it landed. The capture of ports on the European Atlantic coast was a necessity, and the most suitable ones were clear invasion objectives. The capture of these port facilities was deemed crucial, because the lack of supplies would easily strand an invading army. For the initial phase of the battle, large <b>artificial</b> <b>ports</b> (Mulberry Harbors) would be erected on the beaches, but they had limited tonnage unloading capabilities, and were considered as a contingency until real ports could be captured and put into service.|$|R

2500|$|Opening a [...] "Second Front" [...] {{was a top}} {{priority}} of the Allies, and especially of the Soviets to relieve their burden on the Eastern Front. While Italy had been knocked {{out of the war}} in the Italian campaign in September 1943, the easily defensible terrain of the narrow peninsula required only a relatively limited number of German troops to protect and occupy their new puppet state in northern Italy. However, as the Dieppe raid had shown, assaulting the Atlantic Wall was not an endeavour to be taken lightly. It required extensive preparations such as the construction of <b>artificial</b> <b>ports</b> (operation Mulberry) and an underwater pipeline across the English Channel (operation Pluto), intensive bombardment of railways and German logistics in France (the Transportation Plan), and the wide-ranging military deception such as creating entire dummy armies like FUSAG (operation Bodyguard) to make the Germans believe the invasion would take place where the Channel was at its narrowest.|$|R
5|$|The {{decision}} {{to undertake a}} cross-channel invasion in 1944 was taken at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943. General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed commander of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), and General Bernard Montgomery was named as commander of the 21st Army Group, which comprised all the land forces involved in the invasion. The coast of Normandy {{was chosen as the}} site of the invasion, with the Americans assigned to land at sectors codenamed Utah and Omaha, the British at Sword and Gold, and the Canadians at Juno. To meet the conditions expected on the Normandy beachhead, special technology was developed, including two <b>artificial</b> <b>ports</b> called Mulberry harbours and an array of specialised tanks nicknamed Hobart's Funnies. In {{the months leading up to}} the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial military deception, Operation Bodyguard, using both electronic and visual misinformation. This misled the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in charge of developing fortifications all along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an invasion.|$|R

50|$|The Friendship Port (Port de l'Amité) is an <b>artificial</b> {{deepwater}} <b>port</b> {{located in}} Nouakchott, Mauritania. It was built during the 1980s by a Chinese company {{to allow the}} city, capital of Mauritania, to be supplied more cheaply than by overland from Dakar, Senegal. As the location is not a natural harbor, concrete block breakwaters had {{to be used to}} create a safe location for the ships. Plans are being made to increase its capacity.|$|R
500|$|In {{response}} to the lessons learned at the disastrous Dieppe raid, the Allies developed new technologies to help ensure the success of Overlord. To supplement the preliminary offshore bombardment and aerial assaults, some of the landing craft were equipped with artillery and anti-tank guns to provide close supporting fire. The Allies {{had decided not to}} immediately attack any of the heavily protected French <b>ports</b> and two <b>artificial</b> <b>ports,</b> called Mulberry harbours, were designed by COSSAC planners. Each assembly consisted of a floating outer breakwater, inner concrete caissons (called Phoenix breakwaters) and several floating piers. The Mulberry harbours were supplemented by blockship shelters (codenamed [...] "Gooseberries"). With the expectation that fuel would be difficult or impossible to obtain on the continent, the Allies built a [...] "Pipe-Line Under The Ocean" [...] (PLUTO). Specially developed pipes [...] in diameter were to be laid under the Channel from the Isle of Wight to Cherbourg by D-Day plus 18. Technical problems and the delay in capturing Cherbourg meant the pipeline was not operational until 22 September. A second line was laid from Dungeness to Boulogne in late October.|$|R
5000|$|In 1958, the Québec Cartier Mining Company {{constructed}} an {{iron ore}} processing plant and an <b>artificial</b> sea <b>port</b> near Shelter Bay, for shipping the iron ore mined from deposits at Lake Jeannine near Fermont.
