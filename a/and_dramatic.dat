5|$|At {{least partly}} {{explaining}} why both Lamb and Hazlitt felt {{the inadequacy of}} Shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres themselves were huge and gaudy, audiences were noisy and unmannerly, <b>and</b> <b>dramatic</b> presentations {{in the early nineteenth}} century were sensationalistic, laden with artificial and showy props. In addition, unless one sat down in the pit, one could easily miss the subtleties of the actors' facial and vocal expressions.|$|E

5|$|Classical thinkers {{employed}} classification {{as a way}} {{to define}} and assess the quality of poetry. Notably, the existing fragments of Aristotle's Poetics describe three genres of poetry—the epic, the comic, and the tragic—and develop rules to distinguish the highest-quality poetry in each genre, based on the underlying purposes of the genre.

5|$|In the Introduction, Off {{explains}} the animal metaphors. Roméo Dallaire is the 'lion' because he acted courageously with {{an appearance of}} control and confidence. Lewis MacKenzie compared to a 'fox' because while he made a brave <b>and</b> <b>dramatic</b> defense of the airport, and was trusted by outside observers, his actions in recommending against intervention {{were based on the}} cunning logic that all sides were, at least, partly responsible for the conflict.
