The vortex lattice configurations in systems with triangular and square <b>arrays</b> <b>of</b> pinning sites are presented for different magnetic fields. Peaks {{in the critical}} current are observed at matching fields for <b>a</b> triangular <b>array</b> <b>of</b> defects, while "kinks" are formed in the critical-field curves for <b>a</b> square <b>array</b> <b>of</b> defects.

5|$|Later {{research}} {{has managed to}} create convincing models of patterns as diverse as zebra stripes, giraffe blotches, jaguar spots (medium-dark patches surrounded by dark broken rings) and ladybird shell patterns (different geometrical layouts of spots and stripes, see illustrations). Richard Prum's activation-inhibition models, developed from Turing's work, use six variables {{to account for the}} observed range of nine basic within-feather pigmentation patterns, from the simplest, a central pigment patch, via concentric patches, bars, chevrons, eye spot, pair of central spots, rows of paired spots and <b>an</b> <b>array</b> <b>of</b> dots. More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the guineafowl Numida meleagris in which the individual feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to <b>an</b> <b>array</b> <b>of</b> dots at the far (distal) end. These require an oscillation created by two inhibiting signals, with interactions in both space and time.|$|E
