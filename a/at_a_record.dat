5|$|Oil {{production}} was slowed {{as a result}} of Humberto, as at least four refineries—the Valero, ExxonMobil, Total SA and Motiva Enterprises LLC plants in Port Arthur—were halted due to the loss of power.

Natural gas futures rose 8percent ahead of the storm, but lost most of those gains the next day.|$|E

5|$|The 1990–91 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} fairly quiet, {{although}} activity began early {{and the final}} named storm formed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> late date. There were seven named storms classified by the Météo-France office (MFR) on Réunion, as well as three depressions; an additional depression was classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), an unofficial warning agency. The JTWC tracked storms in both September and October, although neither affected land. In late November, another short-lived depression formed in the northeastern portion of the basin. Activity remained minimal until January, when Tropical Storm Alison formed in the eastern portion of the basin. Later in the month, Cyclone Bella became the strongest storm of the season, reaching 10‑minute maximum sustained winds of 155km/h (100mph). It passed near the island of Rodrigues, becoming the worst cyclone there in 20years and killing half {{of the population of}} one endangered species. Bella also likely caused a cargo ship to go missing with 36people on board.|$|E
5|$|Up to January 2011, {{market prices}} for NZ Units were largely {{set by the}} {{international}} price for Certified Emission Reduction (CER) units. In March 2011, European concerns over {{the implications of the}} Fukushima nuclear disaster for their nuclear reactors reduced atomic power generation and increased coal thermal generation. This caused extra demand for CERs in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and CER prices exceeded $NZ25 a tonne, the effective price cap in the NZ ETS. NZ buyers switched from the more expensive CERS to cheaper NZUs which were traded <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> price of more than NZ$21 per tonne. In July 2011, concerns over the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis combined with the high volumes of CERS being issued caused international CER prices to fall to a range between 9 and 10 euros. NZU prices fell to $NZ16.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the case}} in Boston, Lee Smith's first game with St. Louis went poorly as he gave up two runs in his only inning of pitching. He {{recovered}} quickly, registered a 0.00 ERA for the entire month of July, and finished his partial season with St. Louis with a 2.10 ERA and 27 saves. The Cardinals, however, were at a low point in 1990, finishing in last place for the only time since 1918. In 1991, St. Louis righted their ship, and Smith accumulated saves <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> pace. With his salary roughly doubled to nearly $2.8 million, Smith reached 40 saves {{for the first time in}} his career. On September 28, he picked up save number 45 to tie Bruce Sutter's National League record from 1984 (Coincidentally, when Sutter and Smith reached 45 saves in their respective seasons, both were ex-Cubs pitching for St. Louis against the Cubs). Smith claimed the league record for himself three days later and finished the season with a career-high 47 saves. One difference for him in 1991 was walks as he surrendered only 1.60 walks per nine innings, by far the best in his career to that point. Smith won his first Rolaids Relief Award, received the most significant consideration for league MVP in his career, and finished second in Cy Young Award voting behind only Tom Glavine, who had a breakout 20-win season in 1991.|$|E
