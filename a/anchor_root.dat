We report that the indeterminate wild-type Arabidopsis root system {{was transformed into a}} determinate root system in the shr mutant when growing in soil or agar. The root growth behavior of the shr mutant results from its primary root apical meristem failing to initiate cell division following germination. The inability of shr to reactivate mitotic activity in the root apical meristem is associated with the progressive reduction in the abundance of auxin efflux carriers, PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN 1), PIN 2, PIN 3, PIN 4, and PIN 7. The loss of primary root growth in shr is compensated by the activation of <b>anchor</b> <b>root</b> primordia, whose tissues are radially patterned like the wild type.

In addition, SHR is necessary to maintain the indeterminate growth of lateral and anchor roots. We conclude that SHR regulates a wide array of Arabidopsis root-related developmental processes...|$|E

40|$|Glycosyltransferases play diverse {{roles in}} {{cellular}} metabolism by modifying {{the activities of}} regulatory metabolites. Three stress-regulated UDP-glucosyltransferase-encoding genes have been isolated fromthe stigmas of saffron, UGT 85 U 1, UGT 85 U 2 and UGT 85 V 1, which belong to the UGT 85 family that includes members associated with stress responses and cell cycle regulation. Arabidopsis constitutively expressing UGT 85 U 1 exhibited and increased <b>anchor</b> <b>root</b> development. No differences were observed in the timing of root emergence, in leaf, stem and flower morphology or flowering time. However, salt and oxidative stress tolerance was enhanced in these plants. Levels of glycosylated compounds were measured in these plants and showed changes {{in the composition of}} several indole-derivatives. Moreover, auxin levels in the roots were higher compared to wild type. The expression of several key genes related to root development and auxin homeostasis, including CDKB 2. 1, CDKB 2. 2, PIN 2, 3 and 4; TIR 1, SHR, and CYCD 6, were differentially regulated with an increase of expression level of SHR, CYCD 6, CDKB 2. 1 and PIN 2. The obtained results showed that UGT 85 U 1 takes part in root growth regulation via auxin signal alteration and the modified expression of cell cycle-related genes, resulting in significantly improved survival during oxidative and salt stress treatments.

50|$|The storage {{organ of}} the {{cyclamen}} is a round tuber that develops from the hypocotyl (the stem of a seedling).

The tuber may produce roots from the top, sides, or bottom, depending on the species. Cyclamen persicum and Cyclamen coum root from the bottom; Cyclamen hederifolium roots from the top and sides.

Triton X- 100, Na 2 EDTA and several bacterial-inhibitory substances reduced bacterial attachment to both surfaces, although this effect was greater with attachment to polystyrene than to roots.

Manganese-limited cells showed increased <b>anchoring</b> to <b>roots,</b> whereas dead cells adsorbed better to polystyrene. Although the anchoring of A. brasilense Cd to a nonbiological surface can be significantly altered by using several promoting or inhibiting substances to affect the properties of both the surface and the bacterial cell, <b>anchoring</b> to <b>root</b> surfaces is less affected by these substances.

The growth habit is columnar or multi-stemmed and the tree develops large buttress <b>roots.</b> The radiating <b>anchor</b> <b>roots</b> are sometimes exposed and may loop up in places. The bark is silvery-grey to orangeish-brown, smooth with occasional pustular lenticels. The leaves are in opposite pairs, glossy yellowish-green above, obovate with entire margins, up to 6 cm long and 3 cm wide. The flowers are borne singly in the leaf axils; each has a long stalk and a short calyx tube, and parts in fives or sixes. The paired stamens are enclosed in the petals which open explosively when disturbed. The ovoid fruits are up to 3 cm long suspended from the shrunken calyx tube. Brown at first, they change colour as they mature and the hypocotyl emerges. The hypocotyl is long and slender, growing to about 35 cm long, and is ribbed, a characteristic that distinguishes this mangrove from the smooth-fruited yellow mangrove (Ceriops australis).|$|R

Research plots were established at two Nebraska locations in 2009 and 2010 with documented histories of high population densities of these endoparasitic nematode genera.

40|$|The hardy {{whitebark pine}} endures harsh timberline {{conditions}} where other trees often fail. Tipsoo Peak, Mt. Thielsen Wilderness. Photo by Michael Murray. Living in quiet solitude on Oregon’s highest peaks is thewhitebark pine- a tree whose story is as stunning as itstimberline landscape. Virtually ignored by lumbermen, foresters, and scientists for decades, whitebark pine is now gaining widespread attention. At high elevations where conditions are too harsh for other trees to survive, the enduring whitebark pine forms pure stands on sites {{that would otherwise}} be devoid of tree growth. Here, whitebark pine is considered the keystone species in a community of dependent organisms. Now, these systems are threatened by a non-native fungus causing white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola). First described by George Engelmann (1863), whitebark pine has been acknowledged as the only North American representative of the stone pine subsection, Cembrae, within the larger subgenus of white pines—Strobus, 5 -needle pines. Stone pines differ from other white pines by their large wingless seeds borne in cones that remain closed when mature. Not adapted for wind dissemination, seeds are distributed by a genus of specialized birds, nutcrackers (Nucifera), who pry cones open, extract the seeds, and store them in the ground in caches of one to fifteen seeds. Natural History Plant life at timberline is challenged by poorly developed soils, heavy snowfall, a short growing season, ice storms, and ferocious winds. In Oregon, subalpine soils are most commonly well-drained volcanic, sedimentary, or metamorphic, and in the Blue Mountains whitebark pine grow on calcareous substrates. Several physical traits permit whitebark pine to endure a harsh environment – flexible branchlets shed snow, stout stems, and well <b>anchored</b> <b>root</b> systems...|$|R
