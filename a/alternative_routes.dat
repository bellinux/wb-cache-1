40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experiment}} to determine the degree of <b>alternative</b> <b>route</b> selection from a rural freeway that can occur because of implementation of a traffic-responsive variable message signage system in a work zone. The message signs gave real-time estimates of travel time {{to the end of the}} work zone. <b>Alternative</b> <b>route</b> selection was measured through extensive volume counts on the freeway and on parallel arterial streets, both before and after implementation of the signage system. In addition, traffic volumes were measured at a variety of locations where <b>alternative</b> <b>route</b> selection was likely to occur and unlikely to occur. The analysis of peak period data found that <b>alternative</b> <b>route</b> selection rates were between 7 % and 10 % of the freeway traffic, depending upon the location and the day of week...|$|R
5|$|There {{has been}} five <b>alternative</b> <b>routes</b> similar to route X43 {{operated}} in the past. When route X43 was diverted away from Bury in 1978, some journeys continued {{to serve the}} town. These were numbered 743 and were operated by Ribble Motor Services {{with a mixture of}} coaches and buses. Route X43's infrequent extension to Skipton was also transferred onto route 743. The route was withdrawn in 1985 due to a fall in passenger numbers which coincided with the rebranding of the main route as Timesaver.|$|E
5|$|Firearms combat is first-person, with {{character}} points {{assigned to}} the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy {{and how long it}} takes to target an opponent. Melee combat is third-person, with access to weapons such as katanas and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, crossbows and flamethrowers for firearm combat. If a player sneaks up on an opponent, they can perform an instant kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by leaving their character idle. They can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking locks, and hacking computers to locate <b>alternative</b> <b>routes.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, construction of the motorway was further postponed because of onset of the Croatian War of Independence. The decade saw renewed discussion regarding construction of the motorway, including renewed considerations of its route. Soon, the originally devised route running through Bihać was set aside and two new routes were considered: One of them was {{a modified version of the}} original route, bypassing Bihać and running through the Plitvice Lakes region while the other was a completely new route further to the west via Gospić and Zadar, which was eventually accepted for construction. Both of the <b>alternative</b> <b>routes</b> proposed that the Zagreb–Karlovac motorway already completed in 1972 were to be used as the northernmost section of the Zagreb–Split and Zagreb–Rijeka motorways.|$|E

5|$|The {{survival}} horror genre is {{also known}} for other non-combat challenges, such as solving puzzles at certain locations in the game world, and collecting and managing an inventory of items. Areas of the game world will be off limits until the player gains certain items. Occasionally, levels are designed with <b>alternative</b> <b>routes.</b> Levels also challenge players with maze-like environments, which test the player's navigational skills. Levels are often designed as dark and claustrophobic (often making use of dim or shadowy light conditions and camera angles and sightlines which restrict visibility) to challenge the player and provide suspense, although games in the genre also make use of enormous spatial environments.|$|E
5|$|An earlier canal {{had been}} built in the Middle Ages to supply Glastonbury Abbey and the town with stone and produce. In the early 19th century a new canal was {{proposed}} to improve commerce in Glastonbury and help with drainage of the surrounding area of the Somerset Levels. Several <b>alternative</b> <b>routes</b> were considered and costed before obtaining an Act of Parliament and issuing a prospectus to raise funds for the building of the canal. Construction commenced in the 1820s; however it was more expensive than envisaged and further funds had to be raised. It finally opened in 1833 but was only prosperous for a short period. The shortfall in income and engineering problems with water supply and waterlogged peat causing the clay puddling to fracture meant that it was sold to the Bristol and Exeter Railway. They used the canal to transport materials for the construction of the new Somerset Central Railway which opened in 1854.|$|E
5|$|In July 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{expressed}} concerns that construction near the San Diego River crossing {{might result in}} the destruction of the endangered least Bell's vireo habitat. Two of the four <b>alternative</b> <b>routes</b> considered by Caltrans passed through the Carlton Hills golf course, which the public opposed. In April1988, the Sierra Club denounced the Prospect Avenue route; federal negotiators recommended shifting the route from Hollins Lake towards the golf course. Environmental concerns raised in June1988 related to the least Bell's vireo included decrease of insects, a darker environment after overpasses are constructed, and the fragmenting of habitat. Nevertheless, Caltrans still desired the Prospect Avenue route over concerns of a more expensive and less traveled northern route. Upset because of the delays, the Santee City Council wrote to U.S. senators Pete Wilson and Alan Cranston, asking for their assistance. Councilman Jim Bartell alleged that the issue would affect the city council elections.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Study on search {{algorithm}} of passenger {{travel route}} in railway transport network {{is of great}} importance in evaluation on railway operation benefit. Based on features of large-scale network and railway passenger transportation organization, the paper firstly innovatively puts forward the generation method of <b>alternative</b> <b>route</b> set in multiple constraint conditions. K short routes is proposed based on layering network to generate the <b>alternative</b> <b>route</b> set of passenger flow and hybrid genetic algorithm to generate the <b>alternative</b> <b>route</b> set of passenger flow in format of origin-destination matrix in order to overcome the shortage of traditional Dijkstra algorithm. Then reasonable routes of passenger flow are selected from the <b>alternative</b> <b>route</b> set. Finally, the algorithm by MATLAB programming can search reasonable route set of 589 passenger flows within 2 minutes in the railway network constituted by 521 stations which verifies the convergence of the algorithm...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to restricting photography of public art, closing {{a public park}} for a private event has also been controversial. In 2005 and 2006, almost all of Millennium Park was closed for a day for corporate events. On both occasions, {{as one of the}} park's primary attractions, Cloud Gate was the focus of controversy. On September 8, 2005, Toyota Motor Sales USA paid $800,000 to rent most venues in the park including Cloud Gate on AT Plaza from 6a.m. to 11p.m. On August 7, 2006, Allstate paid $700,000 to rent the park. For this price, Allstate acquired the visitation rights to a different set of features and only had exclusive access to Cloud Gate after 4p.m. These corporate closures denied tourists access to Kapoor's public sculpture, and commuters who walk through the park were forced to take <b>alternative</b> <b>routes.</b> City officials stated that the money would help finance free public programs in Millennium Park.|$|E
5|$|The first {{installment}} of the story-based DLC The Knife of Dunwall was praised for its level design, which encouraged exploration to find hidden content and <b>alternative</b> <b>routes</b> through areas. The modifications to certain abilities, particularly Blink were similarly well received for the changes they brought to the gameplay from the main game. The story, however, was generally criticized. Polygon noted that the deadly assassin Daud had no motive for seeking redemption, and allowing him to be played as a non-lethal character created a disconnect with the narrative. IGN considered that it felt like only half of a complete game, lacking any urgency in its story and featuring a disappointing conclusion. The Brigmore Witches story received a mixed response, with Destructoid saying that it offered a more gripping narrative, while Polygon stated that it lacked the same tension as The Knife of Dunwall, and the ending felt rushed and unsatisfying. However, the gameplay was generally considered an improvement, providing more intricate level design and nuanced world building that produced gameplay requiring a more thoughtful approach. PC Gamer appreciated that the levels each had a distinct theme, and adequately provided for both stealth and violent gameplay, while Polygon said that only the last level improved over the preceding DLC, introducing new mechanics that forced changes in stealth players.|$|E
