50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>sparging</b> is {{the process}} of blowing air {{directly}} into the ground water. As the bubbles rise, the contaminants are removed from the groundwater by physical contact with the air (i.e., stripping) and are carried up into the unsaturated zone (i.e., soil). As the contaminants move into the soil, a soil vapor extraction system is usually used to remove vapors.|$|E
40|$|Oxygen and {{air mixing}} with {{spargers}} {{was performed in}} a 30 foot tall by 30 inch diameter column, to investigate mass transfer as <b>air</b> <b>sparged</b> up through the column and removed saturated oxygen from solution. The mixing techniques required to support this research {{are the focus of}} this paper. The fluids tested included water, water with an antifoam agent (AFA), and a high, solids content, Bingham plastic, nuclear waste simulant with AFA, referred to as AZ 01 simulant, which is non-radioactive. Mixing of fluids in the column was performed using a recirculation system and an <b>air</b> <b>sparger.</b> The re-circulation system consisted of the column, a re-circulating pump, and associated piping. The <b>air</b> <b>sparger</b> was fabricated from a two inch diameter pipe concentrically installed in the column and open {{near the bottom of the}} column. The column contents were slowly re-circulated while fluids were mixed with the <b>air</b> <b>sparger.</b> Samples were rheologically tested to ensure effective mixing, as required. Once the fluids were adequately mixed, oxygen was homogeneously added through the re-circulation loop using a sintered metal oxygen sparger followed by a static mixer. Then the <b>air</b> <b>sparger</b> was re-actuated to remove oxygen from solution as air bubbled up through solution. To monitor mixing effectiveness several variables were monitored, which included flow rates, oxygen concentration, differential pressures along the column height, fluid levels, and void fractions, which are defined as the percent of dissolved gas divided by the total volume of gas and liquid. Research showed that mixing was uniform for water and water with AFA, but mixing for the AZ 101 fluid was far more complex. Although mixing of AZ 101 was uniform throughout most of the column, gas entrapment and settling of solids significantly affected test results. The detailed test results presented here provide some insight into the complexities of mixing and void fractions for different fluids and how the mixing process itself affects void fractions in Bingham plastic fluids, which have a measurable yield stress...|$|R
40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} to predict the rate of removal of ammonia (NH{sub 3 }) from solution in a sparged agitated vessel. The model is first-order with respect to liquid-phase concentration of NH{sub 3 }. The rate constant for the first-order equation {{is a function of}} parameters related to the vessel/impeller characteristics, the air/liquid properties as well as the process conditions. However, the vessel/impeller characteristics, the air/liquid properties, and the process conditions reduce the rate constant dependence to only three parameters, namely, the <b>air</b> <b>sparge</b> rate, the liquid volume or batch size, and the Henry's law constant of NH{sub 3 } for the liquid or solution. Thus, the rate of removal is not mass-transfer limited. High <b>air</b> <b>sparge</b> rates, high temperatures, and low liquid volumes or batch sizes increase the rate of removal of NH{sub 3 } from solution. The Henry's law constant effect is somewhat reflected in the temperature since Henry's law constant increases with increasing temperature. Data obtained from actual air stripping operation agree fairly well with the model predictions...|$|R

30|$|The ROI {{estimated}} {{through in}} situ experiments can be exploited {{as an important}} determinant {{in the design of}} IAS and SVE systems. Ways to increase the ROI of the Haejeon site (85.21  cm) can be found in existing experimental methods (Edwards and Jones 1994). In an experiment conducted to increase the ROI through a pneumatic scheme, a top impervious layer of 10  cm depth was prepared on a mixture of bentonite and soils in an unsaturated zone of 3  m depth. Thus, additional treatment employing pneumatic schemes can increase the extent of ROI at the Hajeon site. However, since there can be differences between the generally known design ROI and the ROI measured in this study in terms of the following factors, empirical judgment is also important. Before an IAS system can be utilized, sediment characterization of the site should be conducted. In addition, a sparging well should always be established to determine the appropriate sparge air-injection pressure, screen depth, flow rate, and the effective ROI. The VOC, O 2, and CO 2 concentrations in the SVE wells provided the best indication of the <b>air</b> <b>sparge</b> effectiveness and the <b>air</b> <b>sparge</b> ROI. However, subsurface conditions vary between sites, and all of the pertinent parameters should be measured during a pilot-scale experiment.

50|$|Soil {{contamination}} at {{low levels}} is often within a soil's capacity to treat and assimilate waste material. Soil biota can treat waste by transforming it; soil colloids can adsorb the waste material. Many waste treatment processes rely on this treatment capacity. Exceeding treatment capacity can damage soil biota and limit soil function. Derelict soils occur where industrial contamination or other development activity damages {{the soil to}} such a degree that the land cannot be used safely or productively. Remediation of derelict soil uses principles of geology, physics, chemistry and biology to degrade, attenuate, isolate or remove soil contaminants to restore soil functions and values.

This feature provides the ASH with a high specific capacity, 100 to 600 times greater than the specific capacity of conventional flotation machines. In an effort to develop a more detailed understanding of ASH flotation, multiphase flow characteristics of the <b>air</b> <b>sparged</b> hydrocyclone were studied and the relationship of these characteristics with flotation performance was investigated. This investigation was divided into four phases. In the first phase, the time-averaged multiphase flow characteristics of the ASH during its steady state operation were studied using x-ray computed tomography (x-ray CT). In this regard, a model system, mono-sized quartz flotation with dodecyl amine as collector, using a 2 in. diameter ASH unit (ASH- 2 C), was selected for study. Various flow regimes, namely, the air core, the froth phase, and the swirl layer, were identified and their spatial extent established for different experimental conditions by x-ray CT analysis. In the second phase, a detailed parametric study of flotation response of the ASH for the same system was carried out in order to establish the effect of various operating variables on flotation response. The findings of this phase of investigation were then correlated with the multiphase flow characteristics as revealed by x-ray CT in the first phase. Thus, the impact of various operating variables on the flow regimes, and hence, on flotation response was established...|$|R

The objective {{of this research is}} to design,construct and commission an airlift photobioreactor which will enable the operator to monitor and control mixing and the level of dissolved CO in the medium and as well exposed it to sunlight for the microalgae to undergo photosynthesis. The construction comprises of two stages namely the first stage on the construction of the 2 vertical airlift photobioreactor which will provide the flow,and the second stage on the construction of the horizontal solar receiver photobioreactor which will enable the microalgae to tap on the sunlight for photosynthesis. The work represented in this thesis concern only on the first stage. For this first stage, the most important factor is the mixing. We can manipulate it by varying the flowrate of <b>air</b> <b>sparged</b> through the airlift bioreactor. There were three series of methods that has been done to complete this research that is design, construct and commissioning process. The design photobioreactor has been used to construct the airlift bioreactor and the support structure.

A {{contaminant}} plume, exiting from the southwest corner of the landfill, is contaminating the groundwater downgradient and may affect drinking water wells located there. A two-phase remediation scheme, consisting of an interim overburden <b>air</b> <b>sparging</b> system and a final proposed pump and treat and <b>air</b> <b>sparging</b> system, has been proposed to mitigate the groundwater contaminant plume. This thesis assesses these remediation systems to determine their ability to remediate the contaminants in the groundwater plume. The interim and final proposed <b>air</b> <b>sparging</b> systems were analyzed using existing quarterly reports and a literature review. A MODFLOW groundwater flow model was used to analyze the pump and treat system. These analyses were then compared to the model utilized to design the remediation scheme. Several discrepancies in the design of the remediation scheme were noted as a result of this analysis. First, the presence of till lenses throughout the remediation zone was not addressed.

40|$|The task of {{cleaning}} soil and/or groundwater contaminated by leakage from aging underground gasoline or petrochemical tanks along with surface spills {{of gasoline and}} other hazardous chemicals is of utmost importance for federal and state environmental agencies. Traditional clean up and contaminant removal involves dig-and-treat methods that are costly and impractical for large, contaminated sites. Less disruptive remediation techniques, such as <b>air</b> <b>sparging,</b> have become more attractive in the past decade. <b>Air</b> <b>sparging,</b> bioventing, and other remediation technologies that use air injection into soil can become very effective for non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) removal using volatilization and bioremediation. However, the effectiveness of methods such as <b>air</b> <b>sparging</b> {{is limited by the}} restriction of airflow. The majority of the injected air in <b>air</b> <b>sparging</b> flows through narrow air channels formed in the soil and water matrix, which forms a limited mass transfer zone (MTZ) for contaminant removal. Diffusion of air between these air channels, even though very slow, can help the cleanup. Pulsation of the <b>air</b> <b>sparging</b> pumps is among the only existing methods used to enhance airflow, but it is time-consuming and unable to create a controlled and uniform airflow pattern. In this thesis, use of electromagnetic (EM) stimulation to expedite <b>air</b> <b>sparging</b> is investigated. A relatively high-power electromagnetic field is radiated into the water by utilizing a co-axial antenna connected to an EM source. The alternating electric field emitted into the medium can stimulate different mechanisms in the medium. As a result, the stimulated water molecules enhance diffusion of air and contaminant. This thesis shows {{the first step in the}} study of EM stimulation on air and contaminant flow through saturated soils via an analogous demonstration of the effect of EM waves on diffusion of a non-reactive dye in water. It is successfully demonstrated in this work that the EM stimulation of the water and dye controls and changes the direction and rates of dye transport.

The final two sections of this document provide listings of the key success factors which will be used for evaluating the utility of the Decision Tool and descriptions of potential applications for Decision Tool use...|$|E
40|$|A {{concentration}} cell electrode {{was installed in}} a fritted glass surface and {{was used to measure}} the surface KCl concentration while water was being transpired through the surface into a mixed tank of 0. 1 M KCl. The results from the first Fluorox run made with crude UF/sub 4 / showed that 85. 3 % of the theoretical amount of UF/sub 6 / was accounted for, with 17. 9 % being collected in cold traps and the remainder being consumed in various side reactions. Installation was completed of apparatus to study the electrolytic removal of nickel on an engineering scale from concentrated HRT fuel solution. An extremely low yield stress of 0. 02 lb/sq ft was measured for a thoria-urania slurry containing 2. 5 wt. % Al/sub 2 /O/sub 3 / and spherical particles of 1. 7 micron mean diameter. Preliminary data on the rate of uranium sorption on Dowex 21 K from sulfate solutions were correlated with a simple spherical diffusion model. Laboratory scale studies to determine the effect of reflux time, HNO/sub 3 / concentration, and <b>air</b> <b>sparge</b> on chloride removal from APPR-type Darex dissolver product showed that an <b>air</b> <b>sparge</b> is definitely beneficial in chloride removal. Preliminary cyclic cleaning tests showed that boiling 25 % caustic solution was adequate for cleaning type F (20 micron) porous metal filter elements fouled in the absence of filter aid with siliceous sludge from Darex solvent extraction feed solutions. Sections of unirradiated stainless steel-clad UO/sub 2 /, sheared into lengths of 1 / 2 in., 1 in., 2 in., and 2 3 / 4 in., were leached free of UO/sub 2 / with 10 M HNO/sub 3 / in 30, 45, 60, and 75 min, respectively. The abrasive blade cost for the removal of inert end adapters from selected reactor assemblies ranges from 12 for the Gas-Cooled Reactor to 19 for Consolidated Edison. A zirconium dissolution was carried to completion at 600 ction prod- C in a NaF-LiF salt mixture containing initially 23 mol per cent ZrF/sub 4 / at an average rate of 1. 3 mg/(cm/sup 2 /) (min) with an HF feed rate of 2 lb/hr. The thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity at the center of an 8 -in. diameter cake of Darex waste calcined at about 900 ction prod- C were determined as a function of temperature. (For preceding period see CF- 59 - 3 - 61.) (auth...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{equipment is}} commonly used to mix fluids: mechanical agitators, jets (pumps), shrouded axial impeller mixers (Flygt mixers), spargers, pulsed jet mixers, boiling, static mixers, falling films, liquid sprays, and thermal convection. This discussion will focus on mechanical agitators, jets, shrouded axial impeller mixers, spargers, and pulsed jet mixers, as these devices {{are most likely to}} be employed in Savannah River Site (SRS) Closure Business applications. In addressing mixing problems in the SRS Tank Farm, one must distinguish between different mixing objectives. These objectives include sludge mixing (e. g., Extended Sludge Processing), sludge retrieval (e. g., sludge transfers between tanks), heel retrieval (e. g., Tanks 18 F and 19 F), chemical reactions (e. g., oxalic acid neutralization) and salt dissolution. For example, one should not apply sludge mixing guidelines to heel removal applications. Mixing effectiveness is a function of both the mixing device (e. g., slurry pump, agitator, <b>air</b> <b>sparger)</b> and the properties of the material to be mixed (e. g., yield stress, viscosity, density, and particle size). The objective of this document is to provide background mixing knowledge for the SRS Closure Business Unit personnel and to provide general recommendations for mixing in SRS applications...|$|R
40|$|Adventitious {{roots of}} maize (Zea mays L. cv TX 5855), grown in a well-oxygenated {{nutrient}} solution, were induced to form cortical gas spaces (aerenchyma) by temporarily omitting nitrate and ammonium (-N), or phosphate (-P), from the solution. Previously this response was shown (MC Drew, CJ He, PW Morgan [1989] Plant Physiology 91 : 266 - 271) {{to be associated}} with a slower rate of ethylene biosynthesis, contrasting with the induction of aerenchyma by hypoxia during which ethylene production is strongly stimulated. In the present paper, we show that aerenchyma formation induced by nutrient starvation was blocked, under noninjurious conditions, by addition of low concentrations of Ag+, an inhibitor of ethylene action, or of aminoethoxyvinyl glycine, an inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis. When extending roots were exposed to low concentrations of ethylene in <b>air</b> <b>sparged</b> through the nutrient solution, N or P starvation enhanced the sensitivity to exogenous ethylene at concentrations as low as 0. 05 microliters ethylene per liter air, promoting a more rapid and extensive formation of aerenchyma than in unstarved roots. We conclude that temporary deprivation of N or P enhances the sensitivity of ethylene-responsive cells of the root cortex, leading to cell lysis and aerenchyma...|$|R
