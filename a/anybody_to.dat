5|$|Chabas first {{exhibited}} September Morn in the Paris Salon of April 14 to June 30, 1912. Because he did {{not plan}} to sell it, he gave a price of 50,000 francs ($10,000)– more than he expected <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> pay. For the painting, and his Portrait of Mme. Aston Knight, Chabas won a Medal of Honor, receiving 220 of 359 possible votes. At the Salon, the painting was uncontroversial, and it was soon reprinted in American publications such as Town & Country and The International Studio.|$|E
5|$|More than 300 {{hours of}} footage was {{recorded}} by {{the students and the}} two Iraqi associate producers. It was transcribed, translated and edited into a 90-minute film. Getting the tapes out of Iraq proved difficult for Winter and O'Mahoney, who remained in the UK. They had to rely on journalists from many news agencies, especially those in the BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle the tapes out of Iraq. When curfews were enforced, weeks passed before the producers received new footage because it was impossible for <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> leave their homes or the country.|$|E
25|$|Tongan {{males were}} often heavily tattooed. In Captain Cook's time only the Tui Tonga (king) was not: {{because he was}} too high ranked for <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> touch him. Later it became the habit that a young Tui Tonga went to Samoa to be tattooed there.|$|E

25|$|The lessons {{lasted from}} nine {{o'clock in the}} morning to four o'clock in the {{afternoon}} and then he had to return to the farm. There he remembered not having <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> talk to, as his parents were busy and he had little in common with his brother.|$|E
25|$|One cab from D9008 (55 008) The Green Howards was {{acquired}} when the locomotive was being scrapped at Doncaster Works in August 1982. 55 008 {{is mounted on}} a road trailer and has been fitted out with computer simulation equipment which allow <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> take the controls. In October 2003, the cab was painted to masquerade as British Rail DP2.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} also {{spurred the}} installation of security measures now common in most office buildings. Prior to the attack, {{it was possible for}} <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> enter a building and travel to any floor without question. After the attack, security stations were installed in lobbies, employees were required to carry identification badges that granted them access to their suites, and procedures for vendors and visitors established.|$|E
6000|$|Elspeth plucked {{her by the}} skirt. [...] "There's God, ain't there?" [...] she said, inquiringly, {{and getting}} no answer she flopped upon her knees, to say a babyish prayer that would sound comic <b>to</b> <b>anybody</b> except <b>to</b> Him to whom it was addressed.|$|R

25|$|A model rocket {{is a small}} rocket that is {{commonly}} advertised as {{being able to be}} launched by <b>anybody,</b> <b>to</b> generally low altitudes, usually to around 300–1500 feet, and recovered by a variety of means. Popular among children and amateurs, model rocketry is considered a hobby. In 1954, licensed pyrotechnics expert Orville Carlisle along with his brother Robert, designed the first model rocket and model rocket motor.|$|E
25|$|Krishnamurti {{was also}} {{concerned}} about his legacy, about being unwittingly turned into some personage whose teachings had been handed down to special individuals, rather than the world at large. He did not want <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> pose as an interpreter of the teaching. He warned his associates on several occasions {{that they were not}} to present themselves as spokesmen on his behalf, or as his successors after his death.|$|E
25|$|On 21 August 2006, Janakrani, a 40-year-old woman, {{burned to}} death on the funeral pyre of her husband Prem Narayan in Sagar district; Janakrani had not been forced or {{prompted}} by <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> commit the act. On 11 October 2008 a 75-year-old woman, Lalmati Verma, committed sati by jumping into her 80-year-old husband's funeral pyre at Checher in the Kasdol block of Chhattisgarh's Raipur district; Verma killed herself after mourners had left the cremation site.|$|E

25|$|Piper McLean: A demigod {{daughter}} of Aphrodite and Tristan McLean, a Cherokee movie star. She is Jason Grace's girlfriend {{and has a}} dagger named Katoptris, previously wielded by Helen of Troy. She also has the rare gift of charmspeak, the ability to persuade <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> do anything. She is 15 years old and her eyes change color from green to brown to blue. She has choppy, uneven brown hair that she cuts herself, refusing to make it neat.|$|E
25|$|Failing to find <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> {{accept the}} money to reopen the park, Key West residents, {{under the auspices of}} the satirical micronation Conch Republic, sent a {{flotilla}} of civilian boats and fire department boats to Fort Jefferson in order to reopen the national park. When officials attempted to enter the fort, they were cited. The citation was contested in court the following year, and the resultant case, The United States of America v. Peter Anderson, was quickly dropped.|$|E
25|$|During Savile's lifetime, {{sporadic}} {{allegations of}} child abuse were made against him dating back to 1963, but only became widely publicised after his death. Savile claimed {{the key to his}} success on Jim'll Fix It had been that he disliked children, although he later admitted to saying this to deflect scrutiny of his personal life. He did not own a computer as he did not want <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> think he was downloading child pornography. His autobiography As it Happens (1974, reprinted as Love is an Uphill Thing, 1976) contains admissions of improper sexual conduct which appear to have passed unnoticed during his lifetime.|$|E

25|$|Edwards won {{his second}} {{race of the}} year at Richmond in September, {{assuming}} the lead on a cycle of pit stops and holding off Kurt Busch in the last laps, earning him an additional three points for Chase seeding. Edwards' win however caused controversy as it was discovered that Edwards jumped in front of leader Paul Menard on a restart to take the lead for the final time; an action that NASCAR gave penalties for in the past. Following the controversy, NASCAR changed the rules to permit <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> beat the leader to the start-finish line as long as they accelerate past the restart line first.|$|E
25|$|Meucci {{intended}} {{to develop his}} prototype but {{did not have the}} financial means to keep his company afloat in order to finance his invention. His candle factory went bankrupt and Meucci was forced to unsuccessfully seek funds from rich Italian families. In 1860, he asked his friend Enrico Bandelari to look for Italian capitalists willing to finance his project. However, military expeditions led by Garibaldi in Italy had made the political situation in that country too unstable for <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> invest. Meucci then published his invention in the New York Italian-language newspaper L'Eco d'Italia, although no copy of such reports have ever been located dating back to searches prior to his court case in the 1880s.|$|E
25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E

25|$|These {{reinforcements}} from Italy were ill-disciplined {{and having}} no regular pay resorted to pillaging indiscriminately from both Muslims and Christians before setting out from Acre. According to Runciman they attacked and killed some Muslim merchants around Acre in August 1290 though Michaud's account reports that they instead laid waste {{towns and villages}} all about with pillaging and massacre. In any case if the Sultan Qalawun were {{in need of a}} further pretext for attack he certainly now had one — Qalawun asked for the men guilty of the killing to be remitted to him so that he could apply justice. After discussions of the apparent remitting the Christian criminals from Acre's jails, an idea of Guillaume de Beaujeu, the Council of Acre finally refused to remit <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> Qalawun, and instead tried to argue that the killed Muslims had died because of their own fault.|$|E
25|$|Following Chavo's loss to Eddie at the Royal Rumble, Chavo {{was jealous}} of Rey Mysterio in the storyline because Mysterio had sung the theme song of the {{upcoming}} pay-per-view event, No Way Out, and because Mysterio was Cruiserweight Champion. Guerrero would win the Cruiserweight Championship at No Way Out. A few months later on SmackDown, Chavo Guerrero challenged <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> a match for the Cruiserweight title. Jacqueline accepted the challenge and won the title. At Judgment Day, Chavo regained the Cruiserweight Championship with one arm tied behind his back, however Chavo Classic would win the title by accident on that week's SmackDown in a triple threat match when Spike Dudley knocked him onto Chavo. Chavo Classic {{would go on to}} hold the belt for about a month before he lost it to Rey Mysterio. Chavo Classic would later be fired by WWE for no-showing. He felt he should have been portrayed as a legend rather than a comedy act.|$|E
