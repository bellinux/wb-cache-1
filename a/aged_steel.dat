LSM of the <b>aged</b> stainless <b>steels</b> was carried out using a 2. 5. kW CW Nd:YAG laser. The microstructure of the <b>aged</b> stainless <b>steels</b> after LSM depends on their compositions. After LSM, the <b>aged</b> austenitic stainless <b>steels</b> mainly contain austenite (γ) with some ferrite (δ) as the minor phase, but the carbide phases are completely eliminated. For the <b>aged</b> duplex stainless <b>steels</b> after LSM, δ becomes the major phase and the δ/γ phase balance is disturbed, whereas the sigma (σ) phase is eliminated. The degree of sensitization (DOS) and corrosion morphology of the <b>aged</b> stainless <b>steels</b> before and after LSM were determined by the double loop electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation (DL-EPR) using a potentiostat and SEM observation, respectively. Desensitization of the <b>aged</b> stainless <b>steels</b> has been successfully achieved by LSM and their intergranular corrosion resistance {{is found to be}} significantly enhanced as reflected by the decrease in DOS due to dissolution of the carbides or σ phase, which reduced Cr depletion or the possibility of solute segregation at the grain or phase boundaries, despite the presence of δ and disturbance of δ/γ phase balance.

40|$|Steel slag, an {{abundant}} by-product of the steel-making industry, {{after it is}} aged, has a huge potential for use as an aggregate in road construction. However, the high pH of steel slag seepage (pH≥ 12) is a major impediment in its beneficial use. Analyses on <b>aged</b> <b>steel</b> slag samples demonstrated that the alkalinity producing capacity of <b>aged</b> <b>steel</b> slag samples strongly correlated to Ca(OH) 2 dissolution and that prolonged aging periods have marginal effects on overall alkalinity. Treatment methods that included bitumen-coating, bathing in Al(III) solutions and addition of an alum-based drinking water treatment residual (WTR) were evaluated based on reduction in pH levels and leachate alkalinity. 10 % (wt. /wt.) alum-based drinking water treatment residual (WTR) addition to slag {{was determined to be}} the most successful mitigation method, providing 65 − 70 % reduction in alkalinity both in batch-type and column leach tests, but final leachate pH was only 0. 5 − 1 units lower and leachates were contaminated by dissolved Al(+III) (≥ 3 − 4 mM). Based on the interpretation of calculated saturation indices and SEM and EDX analyses, formation of calcium sulfoaluminate phases (i. e., ettringite and monosulfate) was suggested as the mechanism behind alkalinity mitigation upon WTR-modification. The residual alkalinity in WTR-amended slag leachates was able to be completely eliminated utilizing a biosolids compost with high base neutralization capacity. In column leach tests, effluent pH levels below 7 were maintained for 58 − 74 pore volumes worth of WTR-amended slag leachate using 0. 13 kg compost (dry wt.) per 1 kg WTR-amended slag on average; also, dissolved Al(+III) was strongly retained on the compost...|$|E

Corrosion causes strength deterioration and weakening of <b>aged</b> <b>steel</b> structures. Therefore, it is a vital task to estimate the remaining strength of corroded steel structures in order to assure the public safety.

Therefore, this paper proposes a method of evaluating the residual strength capacities by numerical approach and compares the non-linear FEM analyses results with their respective tensile coupon tests. Further, since {{it is not easy to}} measure several thousands of points, to accurately reproduce the corroded surface by numerical methods and to predict their yield and ultimate behaviors, a simple and reliable analytical model is proposed by measuring the maximum corroded depth (tc,max), in order to estimate the remaining strength capacities of actual corroded members more precisely...|$|E

In order to acquire {{a better understanding of}} embrittlement, we investigate pressure vessel steels in unirradiated, thermally aged and neutron irradiated conditions, using an inverted torsion pendulum. Our studies have revealed a marked effect on the damping due to neutron irradiation, which, according to previous work, is related to interactions between dislocations and neutron induced defects. We also found that the magnitude of this effect depends on the steel type (JRQ, Doel, [...] .). Thermal ageing shows similar effects of hardening. A difference in the damping can also be observed between base and weld metal, giving an indication {{of the importance of the}} chemical composition. At a critical amplitude the behaviour of the damping with vibration amplitude changes considerably. This can be related to the onset of microplasticity. Our measurements have shown that the critical amplitude is higher for thermally <b>aged</b> <b>steel</b> than for unirradiated specimens, indicating an increase in microyield due to thermal ageing.

40|$|A ferritic/austenitic duplex {{stainless}} teel was aged at 450 ~ {{for up to}} 5000 h. Electrochemical behavior of the <b>aged</b> <b>steel</b> was examined in 0. 1 - 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 solution containing 0. 01 M KSCN by electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation and scanning vibrating electrode techniques (SVET). An {{attempt was made to}} relate the electrochemical behavior to the Cr concentration i the Fe-rich region formed by aging, which was determined by a laser atom probe. In the early stage of aging, while neither eactivation nor change in activation behavior is observed, the passivation current increases as aging proceeds. This coincides with the development of Cr concentration fluctuation, possibly caused by spinodal decom-position of the ferrite. As the aging continues, the Cr-rich ~ ' phase precipitates and the Cr concentration i the Fe-rich re-gion decreases. Then the reactivation behavior is observed. The reactivation ratio is obtained by deconvolution of the ac-tive dissolution peaks based on SVET measurement. Thus the obtained reactivation-ratio is closely related to the Cr concentration i the Fe-rich region. Furthermore local variation in the electrochemical behavior is noticed even in the same ferrite grain by SVET. This suggests the dependence of progress of phase decomposition on the microscopic loca-tion in the grain, in addition to the nanometer scale fluctuation typical of spinodal decomposition.

The distribution of local misorientations was found to depend on the imposed plastic strain following a lognormal distribution at true strains 0. 1. At 823 K (550 °C), the distribution of misorientations depended on the applied strain rate. The evolution of lattice misorientations with increasing plastic strain up to 0. 23 was quantified using the metrics kernel average misorientation, average intragrain misorientation, and low angle misorientation fraction. For strain rate down to 10 - 5 s - 1 all metrics were insensitive to deformation temperature, mode (tension vs. compression) and orientation of the measurement plane. The strain sensitivity of the different metrics was found to depend on the misorientation ranges considered in their calculation. A simple new metric, proportion of undeformed grains, is proposed for assessing strain in both aged and unaged material. Lattice misorientations build up with strain faster in <b>aged</b> <b>steel</b> than in un-aged material and most of the metrics were sensitive to the effects of thermal aging.

40|$|Infrastructure plays a {{major role}} in the economy of a country. Bridges are a major {{component}} of any infrastructure and the failure of a bridge will affect the economy of any country. Over the past decades there have been many damage examples of older steel bridge structures due to corrosion around the world. Exposure of a steel structure to the natural environment and inadequate maintenance will cause corrosion and leads to impairment of its operation. Efficient maintenance, repair and rehabilitation of existing bridges require the development of a methodology that allows for an accurate evaluation of load carrying capacity and prediction of remaining life. Therefore, careful evaluation of remaining load-carrying capacities of corroded steel bridge structures is of high importance in transportation and maintenance engineering. Even though there are some published methods to assess the strength reduction due to corrosion of bridges, all of them were developed by using specimens with about 30 mm width. However during the preliminary investigation, it was found that many corrosion pits with more than 30 mm diameters exist in actual severe corroded members. So, the influence of such corroded conditions could have been neglected and hence their actual remaining strengths might be different than those were obtained from those experimental studies. Therefore, this paper investigates the effect of actual corroded conditions on their remaining strength capacities and proposes a simple, efficient and accurate residual strength estimation method by using an enhanced effective thickness parameter with the correlation of maximum corroded depth, which can be used for the maintenance management of <b>aged</b> <b>steel</b> bridge infrastructures...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} tensile pre-strain and aging on the {{brittleness}} of mild steel at typical building service temperatures was investigated. Brittle cleavage modes of fracture were developed at temperatures {{as high as}} 10 and 20 oC in side-grooved CTOD specimens, that had been prepared from steel pre-strained by 9. 8 % or more. The CTOD three-point bend samples, SENB 3, were cut from 25 mm thick flanges of 310 UC 158 Grade 300 Plus steel column sections and were naturally aged for 11 months or more after pre-straining. The effect of natural aging was more pronounced than expected, significantly raising the tensile properties of the pre-strained steel. The fracture properties of the steel were also affected by the combination of pre-strain and aging. Steel that had been pre-strained by 4. 9 % and aged showed the greatest increase in fracture toughness, compared to as-received steel, and failed by ductile fibrous fracture at 10 oC. Steel that had been pre-strained by 9. 8 % and 17. 7 % and then aged, exhibited a smaller increase in fracture toughness. At 10 and 20 oC this more highly pre-strained steel failed by brittle cleavage fracture, while at 30 oC failure was by ductile fibrous fracture. Examination of the fracture surfaces by scanning electron microscope indicated that cleavage fracture in the aged pre-strained steel {{was influenced by the}} density of non-metallic inclusions. The effect of the development of brittle cleavage modes of fracture in the pre-strained and <b>aged</b> <b>steel</b> at typical building service temperatures requires further investigation to assess the implications o...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCorrosion {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} causes of deterioration of steel girder bridges which affects their long term mechanical performance, usability and durability. Lack of information on yield and ultimate behavior of corroded tensile members make it a difficult task for the civil engineers to evaluate their remaining strength which eventually accounts for the estimation of useful service life, decisions on necessary retrofit or replacements to promote public safety. In the past, many experimental studies were done on corroded coupon specimens such as JIS No. 5 with about 30 mm width, in clarifying the influence of corrosion on the remaining strength. However in actual corrosion conditions, severe corrosion damages with large corrosion pits exceeding 30 mm in diameter are observed in <b>aged</b> <b>steel</b> bridges. Therefore the existing coupon specimens would not reflect the actual effects of corrosion in their corresponding tensile tests. A more accurate method of remaining strength estimation for the corroded tensile plates based on the experimental results of tensile tests conducted on 26 specimens having different corrosion conditions and wide widths of 70 - 180 mm is presented in this paper. These results divulged the importance and possibility of using of a representative effective thickness parameter on estimating the residual yield and tensile strengths of corroded steel plates with more accuracy. Therefore, two approaches to estimate the remaining yield and tensile strength of corroded steel plates are proposed by considering the statistical parameters such as initial thickness, standard deviation of thickness etc., which represents the condition of corrosion surface. The proposed methods revealed more accurate and reliable estimation for the maintenance management of existing corroded steel structures...|$|E
