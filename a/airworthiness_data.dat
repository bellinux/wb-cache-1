50|$|An {{aircraft}} {{flight manual}} (AFM) is a book containing the information required to safely operate the aircraft. The information within an AFM is also referred to a Technical <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Data</b> (TAWD). A typical flight manual will contain the following: operating limitations, Normal/Abnormal/Emergency operating procedures, performance data and loading information.|$|E

Throu#mut the recording period the records have been searched for unusual oaaurrences, and. each of these has been studied to deternnne its nature and, where possible, 1 ' 6 s cause. This Report describes a selection of ever. ts related to airspeed control practices which were detected in records taken between February 1963 and February 1966, and a study of exceedences of airspeed luntations.

In Phase 1 (1962 - 1965) data were recorded on aircraft well proved in service; in Phase 2 (1966 - 1969) newer aircraft were instrumented and the records were augmented by additional para-meters chiefly directed to obtaining more detailed landing data. More para-meters were recorded than in any previous operational research programme, and much valuable information was acquired in the fields, among others, of airworthiness, flying hazards, operating practices (including autoland) and meteorology, and of assistance for accident investigations. The success of the programme depended on close co-operation between representatives of ARB, BOAC, BEA, CI Data Centre Ltd., RAE {{and a number of}} other organisations. This Report describes briefly the work undertaken and the benefits derived by each organization, and by others using CAADRP data. No plan is being made to acquire further data from specially installe...|$|E

Data captured includes PMA <b>data,</b> <b>Airworthiness</b> Directives, Maintenance, Repair and Operations (MRO) Services and Unapproved Parts. ILS services clients in the aviation, defense and marine industries with its business-to-business electronic marketplace. Ultimately, ILS offers an electronic marketplace for buying and selling within those industries, and provides aftermarket information on supply, demand, and pricing data.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The general {{trend towards}} {{ubiquitous}} networking {{has reached the}} realm of airplanes. E-enabled airplanes with wired and wireless network interfaces offer {{a wide spectrum of}} network applications, in particular electronic distribution of software (EDS), and onboard collection and off-board retrieval of airplane health reports. On the other hand, airplane safety may be heavily dependent on the security of data transported in these applications. The FAA mandates safety regulations and policies for the design and development of airplane software to ensure continued <b>airworthiness.</b> However, <b>data</b> networks have well known security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to corrupt and/or inhibit the transmission of airplane assets, i. e. software and airplane generated data. The aviation community has recognized the need to address these security threats. This paper explores the role of information security in emerging information technology (IT) infrastructure for distribution of safety-critical and business-critical airplane software and data. We present our threat analysis with related security objectives and state functional and assurance requirements necessary to achieve the objectives, {{in the spirit of the}} well-established Common Criteria (CC) for IT security evaluation. The investigation leverages our involvement with FAA standardization efforts. We present security properties of a generic system for electronic distribution of airplane software, and show how the presence of those security properties enhances airplane safety. ...|$|R
