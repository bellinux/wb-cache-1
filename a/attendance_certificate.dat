At the same time, more active travelers breath more and so can experience high pollution inhalation rates during travel. This webinar will review the state of knowledge about how roadway and traffic characteristics impact air pollution risks for bicyclists, including the latest PSU research quantifying bicyclists 2 ̆ 7 uptake of traffic-related air pollution using on-road measurements in Portland. The PSU research team including Alex Bigazzi, Jim Pankow, and Miguel Figliozzi quantified bicyclist exposure concentrations on different types of roadways, respiration responses to exertion level, and changes in blood concentrations of pollutants. Implications for planners, engineers, and policy-makers will be discussed, including guidance for more pollution-conscious bicycle network planning and design. Additionally, ways for individual travelers to reduce their air pollution risks will be discussed. This 60 -minute webinar is eligible for one hour of training which equals 1 CM or 1 PDH.

40|$|The European Board for Accreditation in Cardiology (EBAC) {{is a joint}} {{initiative}} of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the Cardiology Section of the Union of European Medical Specialists or Union Européenne des Médecins Spécialistes (UEMS). EBAC operates independently from these parent organisations. The ESC is the highest cardiovascular scientific authority in Europe {{and the most important}} provider of Continuing Medical Education (CME) in cardiology. The UEMS officially represents the European medical specialists at the European Union (EU). The UEMS consists of different mono-specialist sections, among which the Cardiology Section. The recognition of the importance of CME and the need for quality standards and quality control led the UEMS to establish the European Accreditation Council for CME (EACCME) in January 2000. CME activities that seek European accreditation have to comply with the regulations of this council. As a consequence of the establishment of EACCME, the mono-specialist sections of the UEMS together with the different European scientific societies started to create accreditation boards with the aim to assess international CME activities in accordance with the regulations of UEMS and EACCME. EBAC was founded in 2000. EBAC accreditation is complimentary to national CME accreditation. The Netherlands Society of Cardiology (Nederlandse Vereniging voor Cardiologie, NVVC) and its Institute for CME, the Netherlands Institute for Continuing Cardiovascular Education (Cardio-Vasculair Onderwijs Instituut, CVOI) formally recognise EBAC accreditation and <b>Attendance</b> <b>Certificates...</b>|$|R

40|$|One {{major issue}} that schools are {{currently}} facing and seeing {{little or no}} improvement with is effectively dealing with student absenteeism and truancy. Despite early interventions, programs are still failing to effectively motivate students to attend school. 	This research study examines the success of an implementation of a perfect attendance award within an elementary school to increase student attendance. An examination of student attendance from the 2006 - 2007 academic year and from the 2007 - 2008 academic year, suggested that the perfect <b>attendance</b> <b>certificate</b> distributed monthly to students with no absences for that month is a positive motivator for students to attend school every day. The data from the months of September, October and November in the 2006 - 2007 year had a mean score of 54. 5 and the 2007 - 2008 year had a mean score of 59. 5, which indicated from an Independent Samples Test that the data proves to be statistically significant, thus the certificates accounted for increased attendance rates. Follow up surveys also provide evidence that the attendance certificates are an overall positive motivator for students and help to increase student attendance at one elementary school.

40|$|The University of Volunteers is a {{training}} process {{agreement between the}} University of Venice and the volunteer community of the province of Treviso. He responds to the third mission of the university which emphasizes that the universities must take a fundamental new objective alongside the traditional ones of higher education and scientific research: the dialogue with society, an opening towards the socio-economic environment by exploiting and knowledge transfer. The demand for such a mission is also given {{by the emergence of}} study and research contexts that are increasingly crossing ethical aspects of society and increasingly engage communication with the public. In particular the person services social environment that in the light of a complex society requires a greater development between participation, knowledge and problems solving in a system of interacting networks. As part of the services to the person volunteering stems from the spontaneous decision to offer a service, free and disinterested, to individuals or to a community, devoting time, expertise and passion. To adequately meet the requests that are turned to volunteers, it is increasingly necessary to have a sufficient wealth of human, technical, sectorial and cross-cutting skills. The project volunteering university is designed to candidate volunteers, to already active volunteers, to members of legal organizations (voluntary associations, social promotion associations, NGO, circles and University of the Third Age), to students in training, to citizens who want to build and / or strengthen its commitment inside the third sector.

40|$|Digital badges {{are simple}} tools {{that have the}} {{potential}} to change the current system of credentialing, creating methods to recognize diverse learning pathways and offer opportunities for both learners and the institutions or entities that offer them. The digital badge movement is still very new, yet is growing as a method to document and communicate what an individual knows or can do. Digital badges highlight skills of the earner, who then displays the badge for someone to view, and can validate anything from mastering a skill to completion of a certain course or documenting the acquirement of a special professional experience. Digital badges have high potential to drive growth for entities that sell education as they have powerful visual potential through the badge itself and that they be displayed across multiple digital sites to large audiences such as LinkedIn. An earner’s motivation to participate in courses that offer digital badges and display the badge earned can drive growth for entities offering those courses or events. Current formal knowledge and skill achievement programs with recognition for degrees via a paper certificate exists through colleges, universities and some type of job related programs for those outside of school such as a Professional Project Manager certification. The output of these offerings is to get a diploma or certificate which can be displayed in a frame and/or with a line item on a resume recognizing the achievement. So if the earner valued these certificates, they either place the certificate in a frame or display it for all to see; they would add the certification as line item to their resume to share with potential employers; or if applicable, so note them on some other type of shareable medium such as a business card. This is true as well for many companies, businesses or formal certification programs outside of the official education model. Due to the growth of technology, the Internet, social media and portable electronic devices that are with people 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year, people are learning and sharing information about themselves in many different ways. As technology evolves so do the uses. There is a need for recognition of skill and knowledge achievements beyond public, private and higher education. Due to technology advancements, digital badges are a method of recognizing the knowledge and skills a learner currently has or acquires above and beyond formal institutionalized education and outside of a paper-based <b>attendance</b> or <b>certificate</b> completion. Because digital badges are still fairly new, it is important to research the awareness, value, and perceived benefits of digital badges by the earner as {{they are the ones who}} will seek to attain and ultimately display them. This will in turn guide the development of programs with digital badges through their areas of interest and create critical mass for those programs offering them. There are three parties engaged in the transaction of a digital badge: earner, this is the person who can earn and choose to display the digital badge; issuer, this the person who has tied all the credentials to the badge and offers it to the earner; and observer, this is the person who looks at the badge displayed or offered digitally by the earner. The purpose of this study is to understand the earner’s awareness of digital badges, their interest in digital badges and the courses that offer them, and the perceived value of a digital badge and courses that offer digital badges. The current study included one hundred twelve (112) participants completing an initial online survey that gathered characteristics of the learner and ratings on their knowledge awareness, perceived value of digital badges and of courses with digital badges, perceived value of displaying a digital badge and the type of badges they would be interested to earn. A secondary survey was then conducted furthering the initial survey to better understand the value an earner placed on a course with a digital badge and what are the biggest concerns or curiosities of digital badges. The results of the study showed that the earner who is one third of a badge transaction, with the issuer and observer making up the other two-thirds, is interested in digital badges and educational courses that offer them, do see them as valuable to have, display and earn, and do find educational courses that offer them as valuable...|$|R
40|$| primary {{task of the}} {{university}} which is teaching and research. 4. 1. 3 Various overseas and South African universities are already actively engaged {{in the field of}} continuing education Continuing educational courses which have as an objective in-service training or refresher courses for professional practitioners, and the general forming and knowledge and cultural enrichment of the community, are offered locally and overseas over a wide spectrum. Continuing education courses for professional practitioners, e. g. for attorneys, medics, nurses, social workers, accountants, engineers and teachers vary from one-day seminars to three-week residential courses. Generally formative and culturally enriching courses for the public vary from evening classes to week-long courses and mostly also include public lectures on topical events. These courses often form part of Winter and Summer Schools. Courses providing knowledge about recreational activities are also included in these fields. Examination of continuing education courses is seldom done, and normally only <b>attendance</b> <b>certificates</b> are presented. On the other hand, it usually happens at overseas universities that credits for degree purposes can be achieved through continuing education courses. It is also a fact that in some cases at overseas institutions so much value is attached to continuing education as a means to the further training of the employee that substantial rebates are allowed in personal income tax to the employee in terms of costs incurred in the course of continuing educational courses. At most South African universities, in contrast to overseas universities, no attention to speak of is given to research on continuing education. Continuing education units usually function as separate departments at universities and are controlled according to regulations, constitutions etc. In some cases at South African universities the unit for continuing education constitutes part of another department, such as for example university education. With regard to the financing of continuing education units, the following variations are found: from completely self-sufficient to completely dependent on financing through {{the university}}. In South Africa continuing education of universities can not claim state subsidies. In England continuing education is fully subsidized by both the central and local governments. Apart from presentation of continuing education courses in the form of lectures, seminars, conferences and discussions, courses at some overseas universities are also presented by means of audio and video cassettes and by way of correspondence courses. Radio and television are also freely used for this purpose by universities that have their own radio transmitters and/or television channels. 4. 1. 4 The Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education has a contribution to make in the field of continuing education {{on the basis of its}} special character The academic skills of the PU for CHE are located in 8 faculties, more than 80 academic departments and a number of bureaus, centres and institutes. This university also has its own specific skills because of its Christian-Afrikaans character, its rura 1 but also semi-urban situation (Vaa 1 Campus) and its specia 1 area from which students are drawn - ski 1 ls which are transmitted via a Christian practice of scho 1 arship and which can then also make a contribution to the provision of continuing education. In the same way as is the case with other South African universities, the objective of continuing education at this university is also periodically to retrain professiona 1 practitioners and also to render community service in the form of generally formative and culturally enriching programmes. Because of the rural situation of this university the nature of continuing education differs from urban universities, in the same way that the number of people involved in the programmes are different. 4. 2 With regard to the main hypothesis: On the basis of the acceptance of the above four sub-hypotheses the main hypothesis can also now be accepted. The crucial finding on the basis of the research is that the university, with its skills encompassed in a large number of departments, bureaus and institutes, apart from the formal task of teaching registered undergraduate and postgraduate students, also has the task of rendering continuing education to professional practitioners and the "general pub 1 ic". 5. SOME RECOMMENDATIONS MADE ON THE BASIS OF THE COMPLETED RESEARCH - The recommendations emanating from the research are distinguished into two groups, viz. recommendations with regard to continuing education in general by universities, and secondly recommendations aimed more specifically at continuing education at the PU for CHE. 5. 1 General recommendations: * Research on continuing education should get more attention. * Continuing education provision to the professional practitioner could be extended to more professions. * More co-operation should be obtained with professional councils in the provision of continuing education for the professional practitioner. * Universities could co-operate in the presentation of continuing education courses. * Co-operative training ("sandwich courses") should be considered for the training of various professional practitioners. * Continuing educational presentations at universities should receive financial support from government. 5. 2 Recommendations more specifically with regard to continuing education at the PU for CHE: * More attention should be directed to the continuing educational opportunities for the agricultural and mining sectors. * More effective liaison should be effected between the Bureau for Continuing Education and academic departments. * Consideration should be given to audio and video cassettes and correspondence courses in the presentation of continuing education courses, amongst others in Christian scholarship. * Continuing education courses can be presented decentralized to a larger extent. * The institution of a course in non-formal education at the H. E. D. or B. Ed. levels should be considered. Doctora...|$|R
