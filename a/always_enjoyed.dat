5|$|Mura {{also has}} support during their matches from their ultras group, named the Black Gringos. Statistically, both teams <b>always</b> <b>enjoyed</b> {{one of the}} biggest attendances on their matches and, in term of numbers, both teams had one of the largest fan bases in the country. The fact that Prekmurje is one of the {{smallest}} and least populated regions in Slovenia has made Mura's fans labeled, by the general public, {{as one of the most}} loyal in the country. Statistically, Maribor is the more successful club, considering either the case of matches from the period from 1967 to 2005, or the whole period from 1967 to present day.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{bombing of}} North Vietnam in February 1965 had a decisive {{impact on the}} Soviet Union's {{strategy}} in Vietnam. Since Ho Chi Minh and his Communist Party won control of North Vietnam in 1954, Ho's government had not <b>always</b> <b>enjoyed</b> cordial relations with their Soviet allies. For example, in 1957 the Soviet government proposed that both North and South Vietnam be given {{a seat in the}} United Nations, a move which would have undermined the North's claim as the sole legitimate government of the whole country. Then in February 1964, North Vietnam joined the People's Republic of China in refusing to sign the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was an insult to the policy of co-existence adopted by the then Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. By that time, however, Khrushchev had already begun the process of disengagement from Vietnam because of the growing conflict in the region was becoming more expensive for the Soviet Union, with North Vietnam relying more on it for large amounts of economic and military aid.|$|E

A step toward their goal was realized with the First Vienna Award (November 2, 1938).|$|E
25|$|With the NES {{near its}} {{end of its}} life many {{third-party}} publishers such as Electronic Arts supported upstart competing consoles with less strict licensing terms such as the Sega Genesis and then the PlayStation, which eroded and then took over Nintendo's dominance in the home console market, respectively. Consoles from Nintendo's rivals in the post-SNES era had <b>always</b> <b>enjoyed</b> much stronger third-party support than Nintendo, which relied more heavily on first-party games.|$|E

25|$|The war {{also left}} a residue of anti-American {{sentiment}} in Spain, whose citizens {{felt a sense}} of betrayal by the very country they helped to obtain the Independence against the British. Many historians and journalists pointed out also the needless nature of this war, because up to that time, relations between Spain and the United States had <b>always</b> <b>enjoyed</b> very amiable conditions, with both countries resolving their differences with mutual agreements that benefited both sides, such as with the sale of Florida by terms of the Treaty of Amity.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time Barks had started {{thinking}} about turning a hobby that he <b>always</b> <b>enjoyed</b> into a profession: that of drawing.

25|$|In an {{interview}} with Marc Maron that summer, Andy Richter noted the contradiction between Ebersol's comments and {{the actions of the}} network. The demonstrable impact of The Jay Leno Show on the ratings of local news across the country was the direct cause of the cancellation of The Jay Leno Show, and gave lie to Ebersol's implication that lead-ins are irrelevant. Leno's Tonight Show, in contrast, had <b>always</b> <b>enjoyed</b> healthy lead-ins courtesy of a strong NBC primetime line-up. Furthermore, the network would have reportedly faced a US$150 million penalty in order to release Leno from his contract, making O'Brien the far less expensive host to get rid of and running counter to the assertion that his ratings were the cardinal factor in being pushed out of the traditional Tonight Show time slot.|$|E
25|$|Sorensen {{was one of}} the {{consultants}} who brought American know-how to the USSR during this era, before the Cold War made such exchanges unthinkable. As the Soviet Union developed and grew in power, both sides, the Soviets and the Americans, chose to ignore or deny the contribution that American ideas and expertise had made: the Soviets because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to a rival, and the Americans because they did not wish to acknowledge their part in creating a powerful communist rival. Anti-communism had <b>always</b> <b>enjoyed</b> widespread popularity in America, and anti-capitalism in Russia, but after World War II, they precluded any admission by either side that technologies or ideas might be either freely shared or clandestinely stolen.|$|E

[...] He was aided in these attacks by the unabashedly Liberal Edmonton Bulletin, which distributed free copies of issues containing coverage of the divorce in McPherson's southern Little Bow riding.

500|$|Prawer {{found that}} he was unhappy with mathematics, and his father {{suggested}} he study history instead since he had <b>always</b> <b>enjoyed</b> history in high school. His professor, Richard Koebner, an Anglophile historian of imperialism, set him on the course of studying the crusader colonies in the Holy Land. The close ties to Koebner were likely to have instilled in Prawer his interest in the history of settlements and colonialization. Prawer began his teaching career at the Hebrew University in 1947 and (after fighting in the 1948 siege of Jerusalem) soon rose through the faculty ranks. He became deputy dean of the Faculty of Humanities from 1953–55, was made professor and chair of medieval history in 1958, was dean of the Faculty of Humanities from 1962–66, and served as prorector at the university in the years 197578. In the process, he succeeded in making the [...] university into a [...] "global center" [...] for Crusade Studies, and trained many future Israeli historians in that specialty.
