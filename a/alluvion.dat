The records have been investigated regarding biodiversity (Shannon-index and evenness) and the constancy of occurrence. In addition an earlier vegetation map of Piz Alv has been revised and completed. On the lower mountain slope the dominating features are acidophilic subalpine meadows (Geo montani-Nardetum), slope peat bogs and pastures, whereas on the upper slope section, basophilic alpine meadows (Seslerio-Caricetum sempervirentis) and pioneer plant communities (Dryadetum octopetalae) prevail. The highest biodiversity is shown by the plant communities Geo montani-Nardetum and Seslerio-Caricetum sempervirentis with 179 and 152 plant species respectively (Shannonindex 2. 80 and 2. 37 respectively). The highest constancy of plant species occurrence is exhibited by the basophilic alpine meadows (Seslerio-Caricetum sempervirentis), subalpine pastures (Poion alpinae), hanging bogs and <b>alluvions.</b> 10 species of orchids could be recorded and more than 12 additional rare plant species, found in the Swiss Red Data Book, could be recognized.

The numerous new remains shown in this work lead to better outline the distribution of moose in Italy, that shows a palaeobiogeographical meaning. In fact, the Alcini were limited to the Po Plain and never crossed the Apennines to reach Tuscany, which, probably, represented a different bioprovince. The Italian moose remains belong, almost entirely, to the species Alces alces, now living in the northern European regions.

40|$|The Chinese term “Shengko”（升科）means “To enter {{waste land}}, foreshore, or {{accretion}}s fore taxation” originally.

40|$|International audienceAbout 4 {{million people}} live on the {{alluvial}} plain of the Loire, the main river located in the centre of France. Their protection against flooding is mainly based {{on the construction of}} 650 km of old levees. During the last 100 year flood of the nineteenth century, these levees were repeatedly broken. This led to catastrophic flooding, especially in the Val d'Orléans. No new 100 year flood occurred during the twentieth and twentyfirst centuries and the likely response of these old levees to future major floods is poorly understood. Located midway along the river, the study area is 35 km long and 1 – 7 km wide. It is protected by 42 km of embankments that have already suffered 35 breaches. In the Val d'Orléans, 6 - 10 m of sandy alluvium cover a karstified limestone bedrock. Nearly 600 collapses were reported whose diameter varies from 0. 50 to 18 m. 62 % occurred at < 2 km from the river, that is to say, close to the levees. Statistically, 35 collapses should have occurred on the levees but only ten of them have been observed. No major consequences resulted because these collapses did not occur during a flood event. The question that arises here is to estimate the potential role of karst in levees breaches occurring during flooding. However, most of these collapses appeared in the {{nineteenth and early twentieth centuries}} and the role of karst was not looked at. The risk scenario is as follows: the Loire flooding causes karst flooding (because kasrtic channels are connected to the river), which induces or reactivates collapses. For the ‘karst collapse’ hazard, some predisposing factors can be listed: density of ancient collapses, thickness and nature of the alluvium, hydroclimatic conditions (frost, snow, heavy rain, floods, low water period etc.). This paper examines this issue and seeks to determine the potential role of karst in the levee breaches. The intensity and probability of this hazard is then characterised. Several mechanisms of levee instability, potentially due to karst, are reviewed. If a causal link between flood, karst and collapse is established, it will enable us to monitor the risk of breaches during the next major flood. La vallée de la Loire est protégée des crues par des digues construites avec des <b>alluvions</b> sableuses et reposant sur ces dernières. Certains tronçons de digues ont subi des brèches lors des crues, ce qui a entraîné des inondations catastrophiques, principalement au 19 e siècle. Dans le Val d’Orléans, on recense ainsi 35 brèches réparties sur les 42 km de digues. L’étude de dangers qui vient d’être réalisée a estimé à environ 1000 M€ les dégâts d’une inondation non maîtrisée en période de crue centennale. Cette étude a permis de caractériser plusieurs aléas de rupture des digues et de mettre en évidence les carences d’informations concernant l’aléa «effondrement karstique». En effet, le calcaire de Beauce fortement karstifié forme le substratum des <b>alluvions</b> du Val d’Orléans où il a été recensé 580 effondrements sur seulement 167 km 2. Certains de ces effondrements ont induit des dégâts sur les infrastructures de communication, sur des bâtiments ainsi que sur des digues. Ce travail présente tout d’abord le site et la problématique des brèches de digues: il cherche ensuite à déterminer le rôle potentiel du karst dans ces brèches et à caractériser l’aléa «effondrement karstique» en intensité et en probabilité d’occurrence. Pour ce faire, plusieurs mécanismes d’instabilité des digues, potentiellement attribuables au karst, sont passés en revue.

40|$| d'évolution suggèrent néanmoins qu'il s'agit également d'incisions relativement récentes, bien que leurs origines puissent remonter à {{plusieurs}} décennies, voire plusieurs siècles. En effet, l'étude de l'évolution pluriséculaire de l'occupation du sol a montré que l'emprise des terres cultivées, et plus particulièrement des labours et des vignes, était nettement plus importante au 19 ème et au début du 20 ème siècle. Par ailleurs, l'ancienneté des occupations humaines dans la région lyonnaise, ainsi que certaines archives historiques (Privolt 2010; N. Jacob, communication personnelle), suggèrent que ces terres cultivées étaient très étendues bien avant le 19 ème siècle. Celles-ci ont donc probablement favorisé pendant plusieurs siècles une production sédimentaire abondante des versants et des dépôts corrélatifs dans les fonds de vallée. C'est d'autant plus probable que les terres cultivées se situaient principalement sur les versants {{alors que}} les fonds de vallée, plus humides, étaient généralement en prairies. La rugosité plus élevée des fonds de vallées a donc pu contribuer au dépôt des sédiments issus du ruissellement sur les versants cultivés (colluvions) ou des débordements de crues (<b>alluvions).</b> Les statistiques annuelles du 20 ème siècle ont montré une importante diminution des surfaces agricoles. Dans les Monts du Lyonnais, celles-ci ont été principalement remplacées par des prairies et, plus récemment, par des boisements. Cette évolution a fortement diminué le ruissellement et l'érosion des sols, d'où un déficit sédimentaire relatif qui contribue à perturber l'équilibre des chenaux. De plus, l'exhaussement des chenaux dans les fonds de vallée propices au remplissage sédimentaire (en tête de bassin, avec une pente faible et une largeur plus importante) a entraîné une augmentation de la pente avec les tronçons aval dont l'énergie est relativement plus forte (absence de dépôts), ce qui favorise des incisions régressives. Sur le Plateau Lyonnais, les terres agricoles ont également laissé place aux surfaces urbaines. Aussi, lorsque l'urbanisation se développe sur un bassin versant ayant subi les effets à long terme des labours, ces deux dernières perturbations se cumulent et peuvent engendrer des incisions extrêmement développées, comme c'est par exemple le cas sur le ruisseau de la Chaudanne. De plus, quelle que soit l'occupation du sol, les drains artificiels (routes, pistes, réseaux d'assainissement) peuvent entraîner des incisions. Celles-ci sont d'autant plus longues que la longueur des drains et la pente du fond de vallée augmentent. Cette tendance peut être expliquée par la faible disponibilité en sédiments mobilisables dans le lit et les berges : à mesure que les volumes déversés par les drains augmentent, la recharge sédimentaire s'accomplit sur un plus grand linéaire de cours d'eau faute de pouvoir être pleinement satisfaite dans les dimensions verticales et latérales; lorsque la pente augmente, les chenaux présentent plus de matériaux grossiers résistants à l'érosion et une plus faible dynamique latérale, ce qui favorise encore davantage les ajustements dans la dimension longitudinale. L'influence secondaire de la pente peut également être liée à l'épaisseur des formations superficielles et à la taille du bassin versant : de manière générale, l'épaisseur des formations superficielles est plus faible dans les fonds de vallée à forte pente si bien que les drains artificiels peuvent intercepter plus efficacement les écoulements subsurfaciques; ces fonds de vallée drainent des bassins versants plus petits où la part des écoulements subsurfaciques est naturellement plus élevée, si bien que l'augmentation des écoulements superficiels est relativement plus intense après implantation de routes ou de pistes. Par ailleurs, l'influence de la taille du bassin versant a été clairement mise en évidence, même parmi les cours d'eau de faible rang : aucune incision n'a été recensée au-delà de 4 km², et ce seuil descend à 2 km² sur la plupart des cours d'eau des Monts du Lyonnais. Les petits cours d'eau sont donc intrinsèquement plus sensibles à toute perturbation qui contribue à réduire la capacité d'infiltration des sols et à intercepter les écoulements subsurfaciques. La sensibilité à l'incision dépend également de la morphologie des fonds de vallée qui peut être prise en compte par une approche typologique (Schmitt et al. 2004). Nos résultats soulignent l'intérêt de cette typologie hydrogéomorphologique qui, associée à la superficie des bassins versants, permet d'identifier les cours d'eau potentiellement sensibles aux incisions. Les effets hydrologiques des déversoirs d'orages sur la stabilité du lit des cours d'eau ont été étudiés sur le ruisseau de la Chaudanne qui présente la plus importante incision du bassin versant. Les déversements augmentent fortement l'intensité et la fréquence de la plupart des crues morphogènes (supérieures au débit critique) mais ne s'accompagne pas d'une augmentation équivalente de leur durée annuelle. Ils tendent également à diminuer les débits de basses eaux et la durée annuelle des crues de faible intensité, du moins par rapport aux crues plus intenses. Cela entraîne une modification de l'efficacité géomorphologique relative des écoulements de différentes intensités. Les chenaux doivent alors s'ajuster à des débits nettement plus élevés mais brefs, ce qui peut considérablement retarder le rétablissement d'un nouvel équilibre morphodynamique (temps de relaxation plus long). Cette évolution pourrait également expliquer le fait que la réponse du chenal se soit manifestée par une importante incision plutôt que par un ajustement progressif de ses dimensions. Bien que les tronçons incisés ne représentent qu'une partie relativement faible du réseau hydrographique (6 %), les taux d'agrandissement des chenaux sont considérables (11, 7 en moyenne) et les berges érodées sont majoritairement constituées de sables (53 % en moyenne). Les incisions constituent donc une importante source de sédiments fins. D'après les traçages par fluorescence, la fourniture sédimentaire depuis les tronçons incisés en amont représente 27 à 62 % du transport solide annuel de la rivière Yzeron pour la fraction 0, 5 - 4 mm (66 % des dépôts sableux). Ce résultat montre que les incisions de tête de bassin contribuent de manière significative à l'ensablement des branches principales du réseau hydrographique (ordre 3 à 5 selon Strahler) étant donné leur faible capacité à évacuer ces sédiments. Leur capacité de transport est également fortement diminuée par la présence de nombreux seuils artificiels. Quand la pente est faible, ces aménagements peuvent entraîner un ensablement du lit sur plusieurs dizaines voire plusieurs centaines de mètres. Enfin, nous avons formulé diverses recommandations opérationnelles pour limiter les impacts hydrogéomorphologiques liés à l'anthropisation du bassin en général, et à l'urbanisation en particulier. Ces recommandations reposent sur trois échelles d'intervention : les versants, les cours d'eau de tête de bassin et les branches principales du réseau hydrographique. Les mesures proposées visent notamment à ralentir ou à stocker temporairement les flux hydriques sur les versants, à contrôler et à redresser le profil en long des tronçons incisés dans le cas d'enjeux locaux, et à piéger une partie de la charge sableuse en transit en amont des tronçons les plus sensibles à l'ensablement...|$|R
50|$|There are 23 {{levels of}} {{occupation}} dating from ca 6300 BC. In his book, Prehistoric Mersin, Garstang lists the tools unearthed in the excavations. The earliest tools {{are made of}} either stone or ceramic. Both agriculture and animal husbandry (sheep, cattle, goats and pigs) were among the economic activities in Yumuktepe. In the layer which corresponds to roughly 4500 BC, {{one of the earliest}} fortifications in human history exists. According to Isabella Caneva, during the chalcolithic age an early copper blast furnace was in use in Yumuktepe. Yumuktepe was probably a coastal settlement, but because of the <b>alluvion</b> carried by the nearby river Müftü, the mound is now 2.5 km north of the Mediterranean shore.|$|E
50|$|The Middle Branch Trail {{begins on}} Warner Street, {{travelling}} south one block. Before <b>Alluvion</b> Street, it turns west onto a unique bike path running against the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River {{and behind the}} Greyhound bus terminal. The path crosses two bridges along its route. It comes back to meet the northern terminus of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway's freeway section, splitting from it immediately and running {{to the east of}} Annapolis Road. The bike path then turns onto Clare Street, crossing the Baltimore Light Rail tracks, then turning south onto Kloman Street and Wenburn Street, which run parallel to the Light Rail tracks and its Westport station. Along these two streets, the South Baltimore Industrial Track crosses at an oblique angle, along with several other abandoned railroads.|$|E
30|$|Besides content directories, {{all four}} sites had, at data {{collection}} time, additional Web pages that tracked the {{upload and download}} progress together with the uptime of users in all torrents. The traces were collected by periodically scraping these Web pages. Scrapes were hourly for Bitsoup, Etree and <b>Alluvion,</b> and happened every 6  min for Filelist.|$|E

Nevertheless, in spite of not being random, this sample contains two sites of a similar type—Bitsoup and Filelist—and two sites of considerably different audience—Etree and <b>Alluvion.</b> Regularities found across these four sites are evidence of generality for our results.|$|E
