5|$|A {{number of}} Maratha gunners who had feigned death when the British {{advanced}} over their position re-manned their guns {{and began to}} pour cannon fire into {{the rear of the}} 74th and Madras infantry. Wellesley ordered his four sepoy battalions to re-form and ward off any threat from the Maratha infantry and cavalry while the 78th were sent back to retake the Maratha gun line. Wellesley, meanwhile, galloped back to 7th Madras Native Cavalry, which had been held back in reserve to the east, and led a cavalry charge from the opposite direction. The gunners again stood their ground but were eventually driven from their guns <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> it was ensured that all those who remained were dead.|$|E
5|$|After Kaga left Nintendo, {{he founded}} a studio called Tirnanog and began {{development}} on a game titled Emblem Saga, a strategy role-playing {{game for the}} PlayStation. The game bore multiple similarities to the Fire Emblem series, and Nintendo {{filed a lawsuit against}} Tirnanog for copyright infringement. The first suit failed, and the court ruled in Tirnanog's favor. Nintendo filed a second lawsuit, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> was awarded a cash settlement of ¥76 million. Nevertheless, Tirnanog and publisher Enterbrain were still allowed to publish the title, though they changed its name to Tear Ring Saga, and eventually developed a sequel. Nintendo attempted taking a third lawsuit to the Japanese Supreme Court in 2005, but the second ruling was upheld.|$|E

However, the Germans had held the centre of the battlefield for almost the entire day, and this had stalled the French advance.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Génessier {{performs}} heterograft surgery, removing Edna's face. The doctor successfully grafts {{the skin}} onto his daughter's face {{and holds the}} heavily bandaged and faceless Edna against her will. Edna escapes, but falls to her death from an upstairs window. After disposing of Edna's corpse, Génessier notices flaws on Christiane's face. Her face grows worse within days; the new tissue is being rejected and she must resort to wearing her mask again. Christiane again phones Jacques <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> says his name, but the phone call is interrupted by Louise.|$|E
5|$|England beat Scotland 7–2 in April 1955, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> Matthews linked up {{much better}} with Revie, and 40-year-old Matthews was largely {{credited}} for the outstanding margin of victory. In this game Duncan Edwards {{was making his}} England debut; when Matthews made his, Edwards had not even been born. Matthews went on England's unsuccessful tour of the continent in 1955, as the selectors erratic choices helped to ensure a 1–0 defeat to France, a 1–1 draw with Spain, and a 3–1 defeat to Portugal. Left out against Denmark, {{he was back in}} the team in October for a 1–1 draw with Wales.|$|E

Having been transferred to the RAAF reserve upon his demobilisation, he sought readmission to the PAF in August the same year, without success. He then took up farming, purchasing a property on the Murray River. In April 1951 he again applied to rejoin the PAF <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> was granted a commission as a wing commander. Over the next two years he held training posts in Victoria, firstly at the RAAF Staff College, Point Cook, and in 1952 at Central Flying School, East Sale.

5|$|For {{the third}} time in as many road games the Rockets were victorious, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> Toledo {{defeated}} the Ohio Bobcats 27–20 at Peden Stadium in Athens. After a scoreless first quarter, each team connected on a field goal before Troy Parker scored the first touchdown of the game on an 11-yard run for a 10–3 Toledo lead. Each team again traded field goals later in the quarter to make the halftime score 13–6.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 {{she wrote}} Je Me Souviens (I Remember), an {{intensely}} personal prose poem {{about their relationship}} which was presented as a single handwritten copy to Vivien {{in an attempt to}} win her back. They reconciled and traveled together to Lesbos, where they lived happily together for a short time and talked about starting a school of poetry for women like the one which Sappho, according to tradition, had founded on Lesbos some 2,500 years before. However, Vivien soon got a letter from her lover Baroness Hélène van Zuylen and went to Constantinople thinking she would break up with her in person. Vivien planned to meet Barney in Paris afterward but instead stayed with the Baroness <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> the breakup was permanent.|$|E

5|$|In January 1961, {{as part of}} {{the process}} of decolonisation, the island's British {{authorities}} drew up constituencies and held democratic elections. Both the ASP and the ZNP won 11 of the available 22 seats in Zanzibar's Parliament, so further elections were held in June with the number of seats increased to 23. The ZNP entered into a coalition with the Zanzibar and Pemba People's Party (ZPPP) <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> took 13 seats, while the ASP, despite receiving the most votes, won just 10. Electoral fraud was suspected by the ASP and civil disorder broke out, resulting in 68 deaths. To maintain control, the coalition government banned the more radical opposition parties, filled the civil service with its own appointees, and politicised the police.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Trunajaya's forces, Amangkurat II continued to face opposition {{from his brother}} Pangeran Puger, who had taken the old capital in Plered and had claimed the throne for himself in 1677. Before the defeat of Trunajaya, Amangkurat's forces had not taken action against him. After Trunajaya was defeated, Amangkurat still could not convince his brother to submit. In September 1680 Amangkurat constructed a new capital in Kartasura. In November, Amangkurat and VOC forces drove Puger from Plered. However, Puger quickly rebuilt his forces, took Plered again in August 1681, and nearly took Kartasura. In November 1681 VOC and Mataram forces again defeated Puger, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> he submitted and was pardoned by his brother.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, {{the college}} moved {{location}} {{several times before}} establishing itself at its present campus in Hereford. The first of these moves occurred {{at the beginning of}} the Second World War, when the college was evacuated from its London site and moved to a mansion named Great Maytham in Rolvenden in west Kent. However, because of the threat of a German invasion, the authorities soon advised another move, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> with 24 hours notice and the help of the London Society for the Blind, a temporary home was found for RNC in Dorton, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. At the time of the move most of the students were on holiday, although some thirty had remained at the college along with several staff members.|$|E

5|$|On 13 February 1386 Corfu became {{once more}} a Venetian {{possession}} <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> Venetian rule would last {{until the end}} of the Republic. This was accomplished voluntary by the people of Corfu. On 10 May, the Corfiotes appointed five ambassadors to submit to the Venetian senate. The Ottomans made several attempts to capture Corfu, the first of which was in 1537. This attack led Venice to an alliance with the Pope and Emperor Charles V, known as the Holy League, against the Ottoman Empire. Another major unsuccessful Ottoman attack was that of July 1716.|$|E

It was named in memory of All Blacks captain Dave Gallaher who captained the All Blacks against France in 1906 and who died at the Battle of Passchendaele. The Cup was first contested on Armistice Day (11 November) 2000. The All Blacks won 3926 and scored two tries while Andrew Mehrtens scored nine penalties. The two met again the following week <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> France won 4233, but as only the first Test counted towards the trophy the All Blacks retained it.|$|E
5|$|The Rochefoucaulds, who {{had played}} a major role in the fight against the English, now began to ravish Angoulême.

In 1446 the Rochefoucaulds managed to obtain the king's pardon and permission to build a defensive wall and two towers in Verteuil to restore the traditional refuge of the villagers. Under this pretext they made the castle among the best defended in France.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} Rugby World Cup {{had been}} {{suggested}} on numerous occasions {{going back to the}} 1950s, but met with opposition from most unions in the IRFB. The idea resurfaced several times in the early 1980s, with the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) in 1983, and the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) in 1984 independently proposing the establishment of a world cup. A proposal was again put to the IRFB in 1985 <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> successfully passed 10–6.
