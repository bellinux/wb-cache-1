5|$|Aquemini is {{the third}} studio album by American hip hop duo Outkast. It was {{released}} on September 29, 1998, by LaFace Records. The title is a portmanteau of the two performers' Zodiac signs: <b>Aquarius</b> (Big Boi) and Gemini (André 3000), which {{is indicative of the}} album's recurring theme of the differing personalities of the two members. The group recorded the majority of the album in Bobby Brown's Bosstown Recording Studios and Doppler Studios, both in Atlanta, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 d is an {{exoplanet}} approximately 15 {{light-years away}} in the constellation of <b>Aquarius.</b> The planet was the third planet discovered orbiting the red dwarf Gliese 876. At {{the time of its}} discovery, the planet had the lowest mass of any known extrasolar planet apart from the pulsar planets orbiting PSR B1257+12. Due to this low mass, it can be categorized as a super-Earth.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} myth of {{more recent}} origin {{is that of}} the Glastonbury Zodiac, a purported astrological zodiac of gargantuan proportions said to have been carved into the land along ancient hedgerows and trackways, in which the Tor forms part of the figure representing <b>Aquarius.</b> The theory was first put forward in 1927 by Katherine Maltwood, an artist with an interest in the occult, who thought the zodiac was constructed approximately 5,000 years ago. But {{the vast majority of the}} land said by Maltwood to be covered by the zodiac was under several feet of water at the proposed time of its construction, and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.|$|E
5|$|However, Sitchin, {{who died}} in 2010, denied any {{connection}} between his work and Lieder's claims. In 2007, partly in response to Lieder's proclamations, Sitchin published a book, The End of Days, which set {{the time for the}} last passing of Nibiru by Earth at 556 BC, which would mean, given the object's supposed 3,600-year orbit, that it would return sometime around AD 2900. He did however say that he believed that the Annunaki might return earlier by spaceship, and that the timing of their return would coincide with the shift from the astrological Age of Pisces to the Age of <b>Aquarius,</b> sometime between 2090 and 2370.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} in the early 1970s that she read John Michell's The View Over Atlantis and was heavily {{influenced}} by it, embracing Michell's view that there were ley lines across the British landscape that channelled earth energies. Inspired, she began searching for ley lines in the area around Brighton. She also began subscribing to The Ley Hunter magazine, for which she authored several articles and book reviews. Valiente came to see the public emergence of Wicca {{as a sign of the}} Age of <b>Aquarius,</b> arguing that the religion should ally with the feminist and environmentalist movements in order to establish a better future for the planet.|$|E
5|$|The First Point of Aries, the {{location}} of the vernal equinox, is named for the constellation. This is because the Sun crossed the celestial equator from south to north in Aries more than two millennia ago. Hipparchus defined it in 130 BC. as a point south of Gamma Arietis. Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the First Point of Aries has since moved into Pisces and will move into <b>Aquarius</b> by around 2600 AD. The Sun now appears in Aries from late April through mid May, though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, the {{publishing}} company Robert Hale brought out Valiente's second book, An ABC of Witchcraft, {{in which she}} provided an encyclopaedic overview of various topics related to Wicca and esotericism. In 1975, Hale published Valiente's Natural Magic, a discussion of what she {{believed to be the}} magical usages and associations of the weather, stones, plants, and other elements of the natural world. In 1978 Hale then published Witchcraft for Tomorrow, in which Valiente proclaimed her belief that Wicca was ideal for the dawning Age of <b>Aquarius</b> and espoused James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis. It also explained to the reader how they could initiate themselves into Wicca and establish their own coven. In 1978 she offered a book of poetry to Hale, although they declined to publish it, believing that there would not be sufficient market for such a publication. In 1982 she then submitted a book of short stories, The Witch Ball, to Hale, but again they declined to publish it.|$|E
5|$|Chao {{have also}} made {{occasional}} appearances in Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog comic book series. They debuted in an Sonic Adventure-based story arc, where they work together with Tikal to defeat Chaos. At one point, Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles find a Chao garden and one Chao followed Sonic home, and after spending time around his Roboticized father came to resemble Omochao. However, Eggman destroys the garden, and the Chao migrate to a lake. Much later, Cream and her mother Vanilla protect a frightened but incompetent group of Chao from Eggman's assistant, Snively. Cream's friend Amy Rose realizes {{they are the same}} group from the lake and, to Cream's delight, suggests that the lake can be converted to a Chao garden. Following the comic reboot, Cheese continued to accompany Cream while Chocola was revealed to live with her mother Vanilla and Gemerl (from Sonic Advance 3). The heroes would also discover a Chao Garden hidden in an undersea cavern whose inhabitants included an ancient Chao named <b>Aquarius</b> and a guard dog-like Chao named Crusher.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aquarius</b> is also {{associated}} with the Age of <b>Aquarius,</b> a concept popular in 1960s counterculture. Despite this prominence, the Age of <b>Aquarius</b> will not dawn until the year 2597, as an astrological age does not begin until the Sun is in a particular constellation on the vernal equinox.|$|E
25|$|On May 5, 2009, Smith was {{assisting}} two Navy divers, Bill Dodd and Corey Seymour, {{who were}} 300 feet from <b>Aquarius</b> using an underwater jackhammer {{to install a}} way station that would contain breathable air. Smith informed Dodd and Seymour that he was returning to <b>Aquarius</b> but would be back. Five or ten minutes later, Seymour noticed that Smith was lying on his side in the water, his mouthpiece out of his mouth. Seymour began carrying Smith back to <b>Aquarius,</b> but his air umbilical became fouled about thirty yards from the habitat. Dodd carried Smith {{the rest of the}} distance to <b>Aquarius,</b> where the other divers in the habitat helped them get Smith inside. Resuscitation attempts by Dodd, Seymour, and two Navy physicians who dove to the habitat were unsuccessful. Smith was pronounced dead at 3:25 pm by a Navy doctor. His death was the first associated with the <b>Aquarius</b> program.|$|E
25|$|Smith joined <b>Aquarius,</b> {{which is}} owned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and {{operated}} by the University of North Carolina Wilmington, in 2007. He worked as a habitat technician and undersea research diver. As part of his work with <b>Aquarius,</b> Smith answered questions from schoolchildren.|$|E
25|$|Energy and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Brian Baird {{recognized}} Smith's {{service on}} the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. U.S. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, whose district includes the Florida Keys and who had met Smith during a visit to the <b>Aquarius</b> facility, also offered a statement of condolence. On May 15, 2009, at a panel at International Space Medicine Summit III devoted to human performance in analog environments, astronaut-aquanaut Dafydd Williams, who had participated in two NEEMO missions, asked for a moment of silence in Smith's memory. <b>Aquarius</b> donated a Superlite 17 diving helmet, the helmet most frequently worn by <b>Aquarius</b> aquanauts, to the History of Diving Museum in Islamorada, Florida in memory of Smith.|$|E
25|$|Capricornus {{is one of}} the 88 modern constellations, and {{was also}} one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century {{astronomer}} Ptolemy. Under its modern boundaries it is bordered by Aquila, Sagittarius, Microscopium, Piscis Austrinus, and <b>Aquarius.</b> The constellation is located in an area of sky called the Sea or the Water, consisting of many water-related constellations such as <b>Aquarius,</b> Pisces and Eridanus. It is the smallest constellation in the zodiac.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{position}} {{away from the}} galactic plane, the majority of deep-sky objects in <b>Aquarius</b> are galaxies, globular clusters, and planetary nebulae. <b>Aquarius</b> contains three deep sky objects {{that are in the}} Messier catalog: the globular clusters Messier2, Messier72, and the open cluster Messier73. Two well-known planetary nebulae are also located in Aquarius: the Saturn Nebula (NGC7009), to the southeast of μ Aquarii; and the famous Helix Nebula (NGC7293), southwest of δAquarii.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{discovery}} of Uranus, Saturn was regarded as the ruling planet of <b>Aquarius</b> alongside Capricorn of course, which is the preceding sign. Many traditional types of astrologers refer Saturn as the planetary ruler for both Capricorn and <b>Aquarius.</b> In modern astrology, it is the primary native ruler of the tenth house. Traditionally however, Saturn ruled both the first and eighth houses, and had its joy in the twelfth house of mischief and bad luck.|$|E
25|$|According to some {{tropical}} astrologers, {{the current}} astrological age is the Age of Pisces, while others maintain {{that it is}} the Age of <b>Aquarius.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{vernal equinox}} is {{currently}} located in Pisces, due south of ω Psc, and, due to precession, slowly drifting below the western fish towards <b>Aquarius.</b>|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, Smith was aboard <b>Aquarius</b> {{to train}} U.S. Navy divers in {{saturation}} diving {{and prepare for}} upcoming scientific studies in the Conch Reef area.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, NBC premiered {{the crime}} drama <b>Aquarius,</b> with Gethin Anthony playing Manson. The series {{was set in}} 1967 and {{included}} storylines that were inspired by actual events which involved Manson.|$|E
25|$|Mattingly and Aaron {{struggle}} {{to find a way}} to turn on the Command Module systems without drawing too much power, and finally transmit the procedure to Swigert, who restarts Odyssey by transferring extra power from <b>Aquarius.</b> When the crew jettisons the Service Module, they are surprised to see the extent of the damage. As they release <b>Aquarius</b> and re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, no one is sure that Odysseys heat shield is intact. The tense period of radio silence due to ionization blackout is longer than normal, but the astronauts report all is well and splash down in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
25|$|While the astrological sign Pisces per {{definition}} {{runs from}} ecliptical longitude 330° to 0, {{this position is}} now mostly covered by the constellation of <b>Aquarius,</b> due to the precession from when the constellation and the sign coincided.|$|E
25|$|After {{recovering}} the Webware from Pisces, <b>Aquarius,</b> and Cancer, Spider-Man {{gives the}} status of the mission to Mockingbird and Nick Fury Jr. Mockingbird tells Spider-Man that Leo is still being interrogated and has not snitched yet.|$|E
25|$|Delphinus' {{brightest}} stars form a distinctive asterism {{that can easily}} be recognized. It is bordered (clockwise from north) by Vulpecula the fox, Sagitta the arrow, Aquila the eagle, <b>Aquarius</b> the water-carrier, Equuleus the foal and Pegasus the flying horse.|$|E
25|$|Masculine (Fire and Air signs): The {{masculine}} {{signs are}} Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and <b>Aquarius.</b> A native with these signs predominating will tend towards extroversion, confidence and assertiveness, {{and have the}} ability to solve problems with courage and enterprise.|$|E
25|$|INSV Mhadei {{the first}} boat of the Mhadei class is a {{cruising}} sloop {{built at the}} <b>Aquarius</b> Shipyard Pvt Ltd shipyard in Divar. The vessel was {{handed over to the}} Indian Navy in February 2009 and christened INSV Mhadei, after the Mandovi River.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{both its}} {{prominent}} {{position on the}} zodiac and its large size, <b>Aquarius</b> has no particularly bright stars, its four brightest stars being less than magnitude 2. However, recent {{research has shown that}} there are several stars lying within its borders that possess planetary systems.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} a panel of outside experts determined that Smith's death was caused by a combination of three factors: the failure of the electronic functions of his Inspiration closed circuit rebreather (CCR) due to hydrodynamic forces from the hydraulic impact hammer being used nearby, Smith's inattention to his handset and head up displays, and the other two divers allowing Smith to return to <b>Aquarius</b> alone. The investigation concluded that due to these issues Smith became unconscious from hypoxia and drowned when the mouthpiece came out of his mouth. Saturation and CCR diving at <b>Aquarius</b> were suspended in the wake of Smith's death, but the review board recommended that they be resumed with the implementation of additional safety measures.|$|E
25|$|Dewey Dewayne Smith (July 24, 1972 – May 5, 2009) was an {{underwater}} diver, former United States Navy medic and professional aquanaut. He died during a dive from the <b>Aquarius</b> underwater habitat off Key Largo in May 2009. A subsequent investigation determined that multiple factors combined {{to cause the}} accident.|$|E
25|$|In Australia the hippie {{movement}} originated at the <b>Aquarius</b> Festival held in 1971 in Canberra {{and again}} in Nimbin two years later. Many festival goers stayed in Nimbin, transforming the town and local area. It also resulted {{in the formation of}} one of Australia's largest and most successful communes.|$|E
25|$|The {{region to}} the south of Cetus and <b>Aquarius</b> had been named by Aratus in 270 BCE as The Waters – an area of {{scattered}} faint stars with two brighter stars standing out. Professor of astronomy Bradley Schaefer has proposed that these stars were most likely Alpha and Delta Sculptoris.|$|E
25|$|As Swigert and Haise {{watch the}} Moon pass beneath them, Lovell laments his lost chance of walking on its surface, then turns their {{attention}} to the business of getting home. With <b>Aquarius</b> running on minimal electrical power, the crew suffers freezing conditions, and Haise contracts a urinary infection and a fever. Swigert suspects Mission Control is withholding their inability to get them home; Haise angrily blames Swigert's inexperience for the accident; and Lovell quickly squelches the argument. When carbon dioxide approaches dangerous levels, ground control must quickly invent a way to make the Command Module's square filters work in the Lunar Module's round receptacles. With the guidance systems on <b>Aquarius</b> shut down, the crew must make a difficult but vital course correction by manually igniting the Lunar Module's engine.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Sassenrath was {{recruited}} to Apple Computer's Advanced Technology Group (ATG) to invent {{the next generation}} of operating systems. He was part of the <b>Aquarius</b> project, a quad-core CPU project (simulated on Apple's own Cray XMP-48) that was intended to become a 3D-based successor to the Macintosh.|$|E
25|$|March 24 – Guy de Chauliac {{observes the}} planets Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars {{conjoined}} in the sky, {{under the sign}} of <b>Aquarius,</b> and a solar eclipse on the same day. This sign is interpreted as foreboding by many, and Chauliac will later blame it for the Black Plague.|$|E
25|$|From 1996 to 2004 MacInnis was {{the chair}} of TD Financial Group's Friends of the Environment Foundation. In October 2001, MacInnis visited the {{exterior}} of the <b>Aquarius</b> underwater laboratory near Key Largo during the first of the NASA/NOAA NEEMO missions there. He shook hands underwater with Canadian astronaut/aquanaut Dafydd Williams.|$|E
