This <b>alternative</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>option</b> was used by approximately 15 % of the establishments and causes an inconsistency within these years but also across time. We impute the number of trained employees for such cases using the procedure by Stegmaier (2012) and Hinz (2016). However, an exclusion of such observations of the waves 2011, 2012 and 2013 from our analysis sample does not cause any significant changes to our results.|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, the {{prevalence}} of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has gradually decreased, but the age at onset has increased. Currently, {{it is thought that}} RA has become a disease of the elderly, and has taken its important place in the category of inflammatory arthritis at advanced ages. Determining an accurate diagnose of elderly-onset RA (EORA) is not as easy as diagnosing young-onset RA due to insufficient laboratory findings and the presence of distinct clinical features. Furthermore, the incidence of malignant diseases leading to paraneoplastic arthritis also increases with advanced age. Moreover, the lack of a widely accepted algorithm to diagnose paraneoplastic arthritis, which usually appears as elderly-onset arthritis, is an ongoing problem. In this review, the epidemiological and clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, and differential diagnosis of EORA are discussed along with the associated treatment difficulties and recently <b>reported</b> <b>alternative</b> therapy <b>options.</b> Turk J Phys Med Rehab 2013; 59 : 242 - 9...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a positive-strand RNA virus {{transmitted}} by the fecal-oral route. The 7. 2 kb genome encodes three open reading frames (ORF) which are translated into (i) the ORF 1 polyprotein, representing the viral replicase, (ii) the ORF 2 protein, {{corresponding to the}} viral capsid, and (iii) the ORF 3 protein, a small protein involved in particle secretion. Although HEV is a non-enveloped virus in bile and feces, it circulates in the bloodstream wrapped in cellular membranes. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 infect only humans and cause mainly waterborne outbreaks. HEV genotypes 3 and 4 are widely represented in the animal kingdom and are transmitted as a zoonosis mainly via contaminated meat. HEV infection is usually self-limited but may persist and cause chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised patients. Reduction of immunosuppressive treatment or antiviral therapy with ribavirin have proven effective in most patients with chronic hepatitis E but therapy failures have been <b>reported.</b> <b>Alternative</b> treatment <b>options</b> are needed, therefore. Infection with HEV may also cause a number of extrahepatic manifestations, especially neurologic complications. Progress {{in the understanding of}} the biology of HEV should contribute to improved control and treatment of HEV infection. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Expected future {{volatility}} plays {{a central}} role in finance theory. Consequently, accurate estimation of this parameter is crucial to meaningful financial decision-making. Researchers generally on the past behavior of asset prices to estimate volatility, relating movements in volatility value with prior volatility and/or variables in the investors’ information set. These procedures are by nature backward looking using past behavior to predict the future. An alternative approach is to use <b>reported</b> <b>option</b> prices to infer volatility expectations. Since option value depends critically on the expected future volatility, the volatility expectation of market participants can be recovered by inverting the option valuation formula when such a formula exists. The volatility expectation derived from <b>reported</b> <b>option</b> prices depends on the assumptions used to valuate the option. For example, the Black-Scholes model assumes the asset price follows a Geometric Brownian motion with constant volatility. Consequently the options on the same asset, but with different strike prices and maturity dates should provide the same implied volatility. In practice, however, the implied volatility tens to differ across exercise prices and time to expiration producing the s...|$|R
