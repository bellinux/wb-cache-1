5|$|Jerry Goldsmith had {{composed}} {{the music for}} The Motion Picture, but {{was not an option}} for The Wrath of Khan given the reduced budget; Meyer's composer for Time <b>After</b> <b>Time,</b> Miklós Rózsa, was likewise prohibitively expensive. Bennett and Meyer wanted the music for the film to go in a different direction, but had not decided on a composer by the time filming began. Meyer initially hoped to hire an associate named John Morgan, but Morgan lacked film experience, which would have troubled the studio.|$|E

5|$|<b>After</b> <b>time</b> expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E

5|$|The Maryland offense had {{difficulty}} converting third downs, and managed only four on 13attempts, while their defense allowed 226passing yards and 201rushing yards. Late {{in the first}} quarter, Virginia quarterback Marc Verica completed a pass to receiver Kevin Ogletree for a 51-yard touchdown, the Cavs' first passing score of the season. Virginia was able to score twice more before half, to put the Terrapins into a 21–0 deficit. With {{seconds left in the}} second quarter, in a desperate gambit to recoup some points, quarterback Chris Turner attempted a hook and ladder play with a pass to Isaiah Williams who then lateraled to Darrius Heyward-Bey, who in turn lateraled to Da'Rel Scott. The maneuver picked up 45yards before Scott was shoved out of bounds, and a flag was thrown for a late hit by Virginia. Since a half cannot end on a defensive penalty, time would {{have been added to the}} clock, but it was ruled that the foul occurred <b>after</b> <b>time</b> had expired. Therefore, the penalty was assessed after the kick-off, and the Terrapins' trick play was for naught.|$|E
5|$|The {{early part}} of the Napoleonic Wars were spent in the Caribbean, where Walker played an {{important}} role in the Haitian Revolution, and took the surrender of a French garrison. <b>After</b> <b>time</b> spent escorting convoys, Walker joined the ships covering the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil, and struck up a friendship with the Prince Regent. His association with royalty continued with his services in transporting the Duke of Clarence, Tsar Alexander I of Russia and King Frederick William III of Prussia, and he was duly invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath and a Knight of the Order of the Tower and Sword. His later years were spent managing a fleet off the American coast during the War of 1812, and he commanded several ships after the end of the wars, retiring with the rank of rear-admiral.|$|E
30|$|When {{analysing}} {{the data}} {{as a function}} of time since awakening (i.e. number of hours since entrained wake-up time), different peak performance times were revealed between the groups. Within the constraints of the model, whole group PVT performance occurred 7.4  h <b>after</b> wake-up <b>time.</b> However, the peak ECTs was at biological time 0 (at the time of entrained wake-up time) and 12.6  h <b>after</b> wake-up <b>time</b> for LCTs (Fig.  2). The same was seen for EF performance, with whole group peak occurring 4.9  h <b>after</b> entrained wake-up <b>time,</b> but for ECTs, this occurred at 0.2  h, and for LCTs, it occurred at 12.6  h <b>after</b> wake-up <b>time</b> (Fig.  3).

5|$|The Tar Heels {{defeated}} the Yale Bulldogs 9074 in the NCAA East Regional Quarterfinal {{in order to}} advance to the semifinal against Canisius College.

The final, along with the semifinal, were held at the Palestra in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Syracuse Orange fell to the Tar Heels 6758 as the Tar Heels advanced to the Final Four in Kansas City, Missouri. The Tar Heels opponent for the national semifinal was Michigan State. The Tar Heels were tied with the Spartans as time was winding down in regulation. Michigan State's Jack Quiggle made a half court shot that would have given the Spartans the lead, but the shot left his hands <b>after</b> <b>time</b> expired, nullifying the basket. In the first overtime, Michigan State had a two-point lead with eleven seconds remaining, while also having a player at the foul line. The Spartan missed both shots and Tar Heel Brennan gathered the rebound, dribbled down the court, and made a shot as time expired to send the game to a second overtime. The Tar Heels pulled away in the third overtime to win the game 7470. The game saw the lead change thirtyone times before the Tar Heels were able to emerge victorious after three overtime periods.|$|E

30|$|However, <b>after</b> eight <b>time</b> units the {{situation}} is very different, as already observed earlier. There is no clear pattern in the ordering (second column) and, in fact, the ordering is completely different (and seemingly random) over different sets of 50 runs. Furthermore, {{the variance in the}} average concentrations is much lower. <b>After</b> one <b>time</b> unit, the difference between the highest and lowest concentrations is 101.1 – 81.6 [*]=[*] 19.5 (which is 19.3 % of the highest concentration). However, <b>after</b> eight <b>time</b> units, this difference is 365.0 – 357.1 [*]=[*] 7.9 (which is only 2.2 % of the highest concentration).
