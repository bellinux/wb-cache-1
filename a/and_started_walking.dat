25|$|Before {{the battle}} began, Yudhishthira did {{something}} unexpected. He suddenly dropped his weapons, {{took off his}} armour <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>walking</b> towards the Kaurava army with folded hands in prayer. The Pandava brothers and the Kauravas looked on in disbelief, thinking Yudhishthira was surrendering before the first arrow was shot. Yudhishthira's purpose became clear, however, when he fell on Bhishma's feet to seek his blessing for success in battle. Bhishma, grandfather to both the Pandavas and Kauravas, blessed Yudhishthira. Yudhishthira returned to his chariot and the battle was ready to commence.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, {{members of}} the {{audience}} reacted with caution and modesty, but as time passed (and the artist remained passive) people began to act more aggressively. As Abramović described it later: [...] "What I learned was that... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you.... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>walking</b> toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the video, it {{is clear}} that several Millsaps {{defenders}} stopped playing before the play was over. On the thirteenth lateral, Tomlin was taken down but tossed a no-look pitch over his shoulder to Hooten just before his knee hit the ground. Many Millsaps fans believed the play to be over and fireworks were shot off from behind the endzone in celebration. Maddux's final lateral hit the ground and bounced into Curry's hands. It appeared as though two defenders near Curry believed the play was over at that point, and Curry scampered into the endzone untouched. [...] Millsaps safety Michael Sims, the closest player to Curry when Curry caught the last lateral, later admitted that he turned around <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>walking</b> away, believing the game to be over.|$|E

After leaving Varanasi, he visited Ayodhya, Lucknow, Agra, Vrindavan, Hathras and Rishikesh. When he was staying in Vrindavan, one day, he saw a man smoking a hookah.

2500|$|The avant-garde {{nature of}} Akita's work made {{acceptance}} by mainstream and unprepared [...] audiences difficult. When he performed with Kiyoshi Mizutani in 1988 at the Jazz-on-Amur festival in Khabarovsk, the Far East of USSR, his improvised, experimental electroacoustic set was praised by fellow musicians {{as well as}} the festival's producer. The number of the - jazz-oriented (and - even just curious) - crowd, however, had been expecting a more traditional (and much-much more quiet) performance, <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>walking</b> out. Prior to his second performance at the festival — which was to be made to an even more conservative audience— Akita was asked to play [...] "more musically." [...] On that first stage, Merzbow used the finest example of [...] "classical analogue live noisemaiking technologies" [...] to display: untuned guitar, a drumset, various micro-objects, small springs centered in its shell baffles, large aluminium boxes with strings inside to be attacked with a fiddlestick, etc. along with multi- piezo-pickuping and close-miking techniques, live processing through vintage US fuzz, ring modulator etc. boxes, and quite vivid and spontaneous approach, backed by domestically supplied slide and light shows. These live recordings were post-processed/re-mixed and released as Live in Khabarovsk, CCCP (I'm Proud by Rank of the Workers) LP – and as the (once more re-mixed comparing to the LP) CD 26 of the Merzbox later on.|$|E
