5|$|Prior to the 2016 season, Obafemi Martins {{abruptly}} {{left the}} club to sign with Shanghai Greenland Shenhua F.C. in the Chinese Super League, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> hamper the Sounders' offense during the season. The move was mitigated somewhat by the signing of homegrown product Jordan Morris. GM Lagerwey also traded Marco Pappa and Lamar Neagle to other clubs in the offseason.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Warner Bros. {{bought the}} rights to the Nancy Drew book series from the Stratemeyer Syndicate, for a {{reported}} $6,000. Warner Bros. wanted to make a series of B-films based on the character, to serve as a companion to their popular Torchy Blane B-film series, which starred Glenda Farrell, Barton MacLane, and Tom Kennedy. Adams sold {{the rights to}} Jack L. Warner without an agent or any consultation; thus, she sold all and any film rights to Warner Bros., <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> later come into question following the rise of television.|$|E
5|$|The bus tunnel was {{originally}} intended to be converted for use by light rail trains {{at some point in}} the future. Metro approved the addition of tracks to the bus tunnel in 1988, appropriating half of the $5 million used to install them during construction, the remainder coming from federal sources. To save $1.5 million in costs, Metro eliminated most of the rail's electrical insulation, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> later make them unusable for rail service.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} incident, Firmani was {{requested}} by Lazio to accept <b>a</b> loan <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> help him regain match fitness. The club suggested some Saudi teams, but the player instead requested he joined Al-Wasl F.C. in the United Arab Emirates; subsequently, the Italians accepted the latter offer.|$|R
25|$|By 1967, {{overcrowding}} {{became an}} issue at Wheaton Central. In late 1967, the school board proposed <b>a</b> redistricting <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> send all Warrenville students to the newer Wheaton North building. In January 1968, the board approved bussing underclass students in Warrenville to Wheaton North, and allowing upperclassmen the choice of either school.|$|R
50|$|WLVI's 10 p.m. {{newscast}} {{was once}} seen in Rhode Island on Cox Sports; this arrangement started in January 2001 after Cox Communications dropped WBZ-TV from its Rhode Island systems, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> otherwise <b>would</b> {{have left the}} state without access to newscasts from Boston. The WLVI newscast was dropped in May 2012, when Cox Sports' programming was consolidated into Ocean State Networks, which airs WJAR newscasts when not carrying sports programming.|$|R
5|$|The tournament was put {{in further}} {{jeopardy}} in January 1979 when General Motors withdrew as a major sponsor; Eagleson argued GM withdrew {{as a result of}} the dispute with the CAHA. The disputes put the two bodies on the verge of severing all ties, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have led to Hockey Canada refusing to release any professional or university player to any of Canada's national teams. The tournament was ultimately postponed by a year until September 1980.|$|E
5|$|On , 1889, the Land Run saw the {{founding}} of Norman, with at least 150 residents spending the night in makeshift campsites; {{by the next morning}} a downtown was already being constructed. Almost immediately two prominent Norman businessmen, former Purcell railroad freight agent Delbert Larsh and railroad station chief cashier Thomas Waggoner, began lobbying for the territorial government to locate its first university in Norman. The two were interested in growing the city and had reasoned that, rather than try to influence legislatures to locate the heavily contested territory capital in Norman, it made sense to attempt to secure the state's first university instead (<b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be far less controversial). On , 1890, Larsh and Waggoner were successful with the passage of Council Bill 114, establishing the University of Oklahoma in Norman approximately 18 years before Oklahoma statehood.|$|E
5|$|The {{summer of}} 2003 saw the club change {{ownership}}, as Elwood sold {{the club to}} Sale Sharks owner Brian Kennedy in <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> see Sale play their home games at Edgeley Park. A new company was created, called 'Cheshire Sport', which would have ownership of Stockport County, Sale Sharks and the Edgeley Park stadium. The 2003–04 season saw Palmer sacked after another poor start to the season, following home defeats to Hartlepool and Blackpool {{in the space of}} a week. John Hollins, who had been Director of Football during Palmer's reign, took over as caretaker manager, but was replaced full-time by former Northern Ireland manager Sammy McIlroy.|$|E
50|$|With {{the release}} of the film 48 Hours, Murphy's star began to eclipse the other cast members. Murphy's co-star in the film, Nick Nolte, was {{scheduled}} to host the show, but canceled at the last minute. Ebersol offered Murphy the chance to host, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> Piscopo <b>would</b> perceive as a major slight. Piscopo <b>would</b> later claim <b>that</b> Ebersol used Murphy's success to divide the two erstwhile friends and play them against one another.|$|R
50|$|Publius Cornelius Lentulus, nicknamed Spinther {{because of}} his {{likeness}} to a popular actor of that name, came from an ancient Roman patrician family of the Cornelia gens. Although treated with great favour by Julius Caesar, Spinther eventually came to support the aristocratic senatorial cause of Caesar's great rival Pompeius Magnus and to align himself with the Optimates party. This proved <b>an</b> unwise <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> eventually lead to his political destruction and perhaps to his death.|$|R
50|$|Gardner was {{the first}} to build a home in the area <b>that</b> <b>would</b> take its name from him. This name was kept despite his history during the Revolutionary War. He had at first {{supported}} his fellow colonists' demands for redress from Britain, but felt actually declaring independence was <b>a</b> reckless <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> backfire on the colonists and stayed out of the war. Later developments led him to aid the wife of a British officer from the area in escaping to Canada.|$|R
5|$|Avatar—one of {{the main}} {{developers}} of Poinciana—had long planned to connect Kinney Harmon Road with the Cypress Parkway in order to relieve congestion along Poinciana and Pleasant Hill Boulevards. However, the highway would not be built until the company was able to develop the community according to plan. Despite being included in the comprehensive land use plans of both Polk and Osceola Counties, the Polk County Commission voted in 1997 to vacate right-of-way along Kinney Harmon Road to a developer to build a 495-lot mobile home park, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> effectively block construction of the Poinciana Parkway. The commissioners noted that the road had been discussed for years, but there were still no plans to build it at the time. Avatar sued the county and the 10th Judicial Circuit ruled that the commissioners did not explain why vacating the right-of-way {{would be in the}} public interest when making their decision. Osceola County had objected the commissioners' decision and helped Avatar in the case, but did not join the lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia Airlines {{would still}} be {{vulnerable}} to civil lawsuits from passengers' families. Compensation awarded (or settlements reached out-of-court) during civil trials will likely vary widely among passengers based on country of the court. An American court could likely award upwards of US$8–10million, while Chinese courts would likely award {{a small fraction of}} that. Despite the announcement that Flight 370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean, it was not until 29 January 2015 that the Malaysian government officially declared Flight 370 an accident with no survivors, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow compensation claims to be made. The first lawsuit related to the disappearance was filed in October 2014–before Flight 370 was declared an accident–on behalf of two Malaysian boys whose father was a passenger, for negligence in failing to contact the aircraft soon after it was lost and for breach of contract for failing to bring the passenger to his destination. Additional lawsuits against Malaysia Airlines have been filed in China and Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of April 6, around 8:00 or 8:30a.m., Grant's {{flagship}} stopped alongside Wallace's boat moored at Crump's Landing and gave orders for the 3rd Division to be held ready to move in any direction. Wallace concentrated his troops at Stoney Lonesome, although his westernmost brigade remained at Adamsville. He then waited for further orders, which arrived between 11 and 11:30a.m. Grant ordered Wallace to move his unit up to join the Union right, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have been in support of Sherman's 5th Division, which was encamped around Shiloh Church when the battle began. The written orders, transcribed from verbal orders that Grant gave to an aide, were lost during the battle and controversy remains over their wording. Wallace maintained {{that he was not}} ordered to Pittsburg Landing, which was to the left rear of the army, or told which road to use. Grant later claimed that he ordered Wallace to Pittsburg Landing by way of the River Road (also called the Hamburg–Savannah Road).|$|E
5000|$|During {{his first}} term, Clement {{authorized}} a bond issue to provide free textbooks {{to children in}} grades 1 through 12, a first for the state (textbooks had previously been free through only the 3rd grade). [...] He also implemented the state's first long-range highway construction project, and established a mental health department (now the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services). [...] Clement raised the state's sales tax from 2% to 3%, <b>an</b> unpopular <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> haunt him in later elections.|$|R
25|$|On 4 October 2008, a Saturday, {{following}} the Irish Government's decision to guarantee all deposits in private savings accounts, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> she strongly criticised, Merkel {{said there were}} no plans for the German Government to do the same. The following day, Merkel stated <b>that</b> the government <b>would</b> guarantee private savings account deposits, after all. However, two days later, on 6 October 2008, it emerged that the pledge was simply <b>a</b> political <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not be backed by legislation. Other European governments eventually either raised the limits or promised to guarantee savings in full.|$|R
60|$|But {{it might}} be just coming out, and what <b>a</b> shame to <b>move!</b> <b>A</b> skin <b>that</b> <b>would</b> bring five dollars was surely worth waiting {{for a little while}} longer, and he might never have such another chance. He {{certainly}} had never had such a one before.|$|R
5|$|When a king {{is under}} {{immediate}} attack {{by one or}} two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> put or leave the player's own king in check.|$|E
5|$|As {{in falls}} one and two, Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out against each other. At one point, Guerrero applied Hijo del Santo's own {{submission}} hold, La de a Caballo (camel clutch), {{on him to}} mock his opponent, but {{was not able to}} make Hijo del Santo submit before Octagón saved his partner. Later in the fall, with the referee distracted, Barr was able to surprise Octagón and execute a kneeling reverse piledriver, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have been an automatic disqualification in Lucha Libre. Moments later, Barr was able to pin Octagón to eliminate him from the match. In Lucha Libre, the piledriver is treated as a very dangerous move, something that was sold during this match by Octagón being taken from the arena on a stretcher during the closing moments of the third fall. Minutes later, Hijo del Santo was actually able to kick out of the Superplex/Frog Splash combo by La Pareja del Terror. At one point, both Hijo del Santo and Guerrero were on the floor, which distracted the referee long enough for Blue Panther to enter the ring and perform a piledriver of his own on Barr in retaliation for what was done to Octagón. The move was not seen by the referee but allowed Hijo del Santo to pin Barr, leaving just Hijo del Santo and Guerrero still in the match. A minute or two later, Hijo del Santo was able to roll up Guerrero for the final pinfall and the victory for his team. Following their loss, both Guerrero and Barr visibly cried in the ring, selling the severeness of the loss as they cut off each other's hair with a pair of scissors. This was followed by an AAA official shaving off the rest of their hair with electric clippers backstage.|$|E
25|$|Richardson {{would serve}} as Secretary of Defense for 4 months before {{becoming}} Nixon's Attorney General, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{put him in the}} Watergate spotlight.|$|E
2500|$|One of Newsam's {{principal}} concerns was {{the operation}} of capital punishment. While Deputy Under-Secretary he had strongly advised against reprieving John Amery, son of a leading Conservative politician who had pleaded guilty to treason during World War II; [...] he believed <b>that</b> reprieving Amery <b>would</b> be <b>a</b> weak <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> look like <b>a</b> political fix. He also opposed a reprieve for William Joyce (nicknamed Lord Haw-Haw), convicted of treason for propaganda broadcasting during the war. In 1949 Newsam gave evidence for the Home Office at the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment under Sir Ernest Gowers, largely defending the established system.|$|R
5000|$|The contestants in play {{would be}} offered {{the choice to}} [...] "give a letter" [...] (<b>a</b> {{tactical}} <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> reveal the next letter to the opposing team {{in the hope that}} they wouldn't be able to guess the word correctly) or [...] "guess a letter" [...] (generally a safer bet, ensuring that the team remained in play, provided they didn't get the word wrong.) A wrong guess or taking too long would make it the opposing team's turn. No conferring between players on the same team was allowed. After each round the players would switch roles.|$|R
2500|$|Indians {{general manager}} John Hart made <b>a</b> number of <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> finally bring success to the team. In , he hired former Indian Mike Hargrove {{to manage and}} traded catcher Eddie Taubensee to the Houston Astros who, with a surplus of outfielders, were willing to part with Kenny Lofton. Lofton {{finished}} second in AL Rookie of the Year balloting with a [...]285 average and 66 stolen bases.|$|R
25|$|A {{player is}} not allowed to make <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> return the board to a {{previous}} position, with the same player to move. This rule prevents games from entering into a repeated loop.|$|E
25|$|Her {{attempt in}} 1994 to give five Texas {{waterways}} {{and the surrounding}} land centered at Barton Springs to the U.S. federal government, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have seized private property and hurt economic development in Central Texas.|$|E
25|$|Halfway {{through her}} second term, Arroyo unsuccessfully {{attempted}} TP PUSH for {{an overhaul of}} the constitution to transform the present presidential-bicameral republic into a federal parliamentary-unicameral form of government, which critics describe would be <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow her to stay in power as Prime Minister.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} MacNeil's parents sold their store and began <b>a</b> big <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{take them to}} Sydney, then to Toronto. MacNeil's father worked as a carpenter, her mother worked at Eaton's, and her sister Mary worked at a local grocery store. Alcoholism, already {{a large part of}} her parents' life, became worse in Toronto, {{especially}} with her mother's desire to move back to Cape Breton. After a terrible night of drinking and fighting, MacNeil's older brother Malcolm (‘Malkie’) arrived in Toronto, and he and Mary convinced their parents {{that it was time to}} move back to Cape Breton, which they soon did.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 2008/2009 curling season, Auld {{left the}} Goring team to form a new squad, taking {{longtime}} teammate Cheryl McPherson along with her. They found immediate success qualifying for the 2010 Ontario Scotties Tournament of Hearts, where they would finish round robin with a 6-3 record. For the fourth consecutive year, Auld would make the playoffs, but once again lost the 3-4 game, this time to Jacqueline Harrison. After the 2009/2010 season, McPherson left the team, and returned to play with Alison Goring, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> Auld <b>would</b> not recover from. Her new squad failed to qualify for the 2011 Ontario Scotties Tournament of Hearts.|$|R
50|$|In February 2016, Trump {{urged his}} {{supporters}} to boycott Apple Inc. unless the company agrees {{to build a}} custom backdoor for the FBI to unlock the password-protected iPhone connected {{to one of the}} perpetrators of the 2015 San Bernardino shooting, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> Apple argues <b>would</b> threaten the security and privacy of its users. Trump himself still uses his iPhone to send out tweets.|$|R
25|$|CTC's new owners, Southern Cross {{were quick}} to rationalise {{resources}} at CTC, much as they had done at their existing stations in Victoria. By early 1995 staff cuts had been announced, the local weekend news bulletin had been cancelled and on 6 February CTC was rebranded Ten Capital in <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> eliminate resources required to rebadge Network Ten station promos and IDs. Interestingly, just five years earlier the station had been known colloquially as Capital Ten. CTC re-commenced 24-hour broadcasting at this time.|$|E
25|$|To {{ensure a}} stable {{peace with the}} Franks, Autari {{attempted}} to marry a Frankish princess, but the project failed. Then the king, in <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> influence {{the fate of the}} kingdom for more than a century, turned to the traditional enemies of the Franks, the Bavarii, to marry a princess, Theodelinda, from the Lethings dynasty (i.e. descended from Wacho, king of the Lombards between 510 and 540 and a figure surrounded by an aura of legend, a member of a royal line of great ascendency over the Lombards).|$|E
25|$|Brown and Outram's {{efforts were}} much {{assisted}} by {{the appointment of}} Gernan Wheatcroft to manage the canal at Bugsworth and Whaley Bridge. He proved so efficient {{that he was able}} to use the threat of resignation to gain the addition of £30 to his £75 a year salary to keep and maintain a horse to assist him in his duties. In <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not disgrace a modern marketing organisation, the quarry owners retained Outram's future father-in-law, Dr. James Anderson, the Scottish agricultural expert, to write a treatise on the benefits of lime in farming, which they published.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} year, in 2001, APL Logistics’ acquired GATX Logistics for US $210 {{million to}} add warehouse services to its offerings and increase its U.S. footprint in contract logistics, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> it anticipated <b>would</b> increase its revenues by 70 percent, or approximately US $300 million. The acquisition gave it access to 21 {{million square feet}} of warehouse space in North and South America.|$|R
50|$|In early October, it was {{reported}} that Cronulla was still open to the idea of merging with the struggling South Sydney club in <b>a</b> proposed <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> possibly see the new club named the South Sydney Sharks. However, South Sydney president George Piggins reportedly rejected an offer from Barry Pierce to merge with Cronulla despite several South Sydney figures, including chief executive Mark Colley and former player Mike Cleary, calling for the merger to take place. David Miles, who had been playing in the reserves for Cronulla, signed for the Auckland in mid October. In late November, former South Sydney winger Christian Kerisiano was announced by the club as a new signing for the following season.|$|R
50|$|On July 26, 1957, Parker {{obtained}} quarterback Tobin Rote, <b>a</b> prescient <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{help the}} team when Layne broke his ankle and Rote then led the Lions to their third championship in six years. However, Parker would not be around to enjoy the championship season after stunning the football world by resigning on August 12 during the team's preseason training camp dinner. In {{front of a large}} audience which expected him to deliver a keynote speech, Parker instead informed the audience that he was quitting. George Plimpton wrote of this incident in his 1966 best-seller Paper Lion. In his resignation Parker cited an inability to control his players, but his struggle in obtaining a two-year contract from Lions' management also likely played a role.|$|R
