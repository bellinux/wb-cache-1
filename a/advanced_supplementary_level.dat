The mother tongue teaching policy for native-level Cantonese speakers was implemented in 1998. At that time, the policy dramatically {{reduced the number of}} English medium of instruction (EMI) secondary school. The rest of the EMI schools are either highly competitive or relatively expensive. Thus, those schools that are lower level are often the choices left for Nepalese children. School choices are even more limited after Form 5 since they have no legal rights to education after the age of fifteen (when the compulsory education ends). Other than studying in Hong Kong, some Nepalese parents would send their children to receive cheaper education in Nepal until university graduation. [...] After Nepalese students graduate from secondary school, choices of enrolling in local tertiary education are limited, since most of the tertiary institutions and programs require passing Advance <b>level</b> (matriculation) or <b>Advance</b> <b>Supplementary</b> (AS) Chinese Language and Culture examination.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a new methodology for {{the synthesis of}} power system stabilizers (PSSs) and speed governors {{in order to satisfy}} some recent objectives and constraints imposed by the evolution of large-scale interconnected power systems. As a consequence of the increasing size of these systems, the frequency of some inter-area modes diminishes so much so that these oscillatory phenomena interact with the dynamics of the speed governors. These low-frequency inter-area modes are also more spread (i. e., they involve a larger number of generators) than the other inter-area modes of the system. This two particularities require several <b>supplementary</b> <b>levels</b> of coordination when tuning the PSSs and the governors of the machines involved in these oscillatory phenomena. To ensure this, the synthesis of the aforementioned regulators is done using a new control model which takes into account the key interactions of the dynamics of the power system. It thus allows the coordination of control actions among several generators as well as between the electrical and mechanical paths. This control framework ensures also an optimal trade-off performance/robustness. Validation simulations have been carried out with the Eurostag software on a realistic large-scale model of the interconnected European power system...|$|R

Such problems sometimes elude the usual solving methods we are familiar with, forcing us to continuously improve these methods or to even completely reconsider the solving methodologies.

To estimate {{the quality of a}} decision support system when approaching difficult problems is not easy, but is very important when designing and conducting vital industrial processes or logistic operations.
