40|$|Direct {{methanol}} {{fuel cells}} (DMFCs) generate electrical energy from an electro-chemical reaction between methanol and {{oxygen in the}} presence of a platinum containing electro-catalyst. They normally have the following components: (a) the anode gas channel, (b) the <b>anode</b> backing <b>layer</b> (that distributes liquid methanol and water from the anode gas channel to the <b>anode</b> catalyst <b>layer),</b> (c) the <b>anode</b> catalyst <b>layer</b> (that performs the reaction, CH 3 OH + 2 H 2 O = CO 2 + 6 H+ + 6 e -), (d) the electrolyte layer (that transports H+ from the <b>anode</b> catalyst <b>layer</b> to the cathode catalyst layer), (e) the cathode catalyst layer (that performs the reaction 32 O 2 + 6 H+ + 6 e- = 3 H 2 O, (f) the cathode backing layer (that distributes oxygen from the cathode gas channel to the cathode catalyst layer and transports water formed in the cathode catalyst layer to the cathode gas channel), and (g) the cathode gas channel. The direct methanol fuel cell being modeled in this project is being developed primarily for low power applications (lap-tops, PDA's) and to a lesser extent for transportation applications (automobiles, fork-lifts).

50|$|The ceramic <b>anode</b> <b>layer</b> {{must be very}} porous {{to allow}} the fuel to flow towards the electrolyte. Consequently, {{granular}} matter is often selected for anode fabrication procedures. Like the cathode, it must conduct electrons, with ionic conductivity a definite asset. The most common material used is a cermet made up of nickel mixed with the ceramic material that {{is used for the}} electrolyte in that particular cell, typically YSZ (yttria stabilized zirconia) nanomaterial-based catalysts, this YSZ part helps stop the grain growth of nickel. Larger grains of nickel would reduce the contact area that ions can be conducted through, which would lower the cells efficiency. The anode is commonly the thickest and strongest layer in each individual cell, because it has the smallest polarization losses, and is often the layer that provides the mechanical support. Electrochemically speaking, the anode’s job is to use the oxygen ions that diffuse through the electrolyte to oxidize the hydrogen fuel.The oxidation reaction between the oxygen ions and the hydrogen produces heat as well as water and electricity.If the fuel is a light hydrocarbon, for example, methane, another function of the anode is to act as a catalyst for steam reforming the fuel into hydrogen. This provides another operational benefit to the fuel cell stack because the reforming reaction is endothermic, which cools the stack internally. Perovskite materials (mixed ionic/electronic conducting ceramics) have been shown to produce a power density of 0.6 W/cm2 at 0.7 V at 800 °C which is possible because they have the ability to overcome a larger activation energy.|$|E

The use of 0 - 20 wt. % of ethanol in the inner layer spinning suspension allows the control over the asymmetric structure of the Ni-CGO <b>anode</b> <b>layer,</b> i. e. finger-like voids structure covering about 50 - 85 % of the <b>anode</b> <b>layer</b> thickness with the rest volume occupied by sponge-like structure, {{and at the same}} time affects the morphology of the CGO electrolyte layer. The presence of finger-like voids significantly facilitates the fuel gas diffusion inside the anode, and as a result, the maximum power density increases from 1. 84 W m - 2 to 2. 32 W cm - 2, when the finger-like voids is increased from 50 % to 70 % of the asymmetric <b>anode</b> <b>layer.</b> However, further growth of finger-like voids, i. e. 85 % of the <b>anode</b> <b>layer,</b> dramatically reduce the number of triple-phase boundary (TPB) region and conductivity in the anode, as well as the gas-tightness property of the electrolyte, which consequently decreases the maximum power density to 0. 99 W cm - 2.
