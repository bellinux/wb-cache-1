40|$|Abstract. A quantum {{mechanics}} based method {{is presented to}} generate <b>sets</b> of digital <b>angles</b> that may be well suited to describe projections on discrete grids. The resulting <b>angle</b> <b>sets</b> are an alternative to those derived using the Farey fractions from number theory. The Farey angles arise naturally through the definitions of the Mojette and Finite Radon Transforms. Often {{a subset of the}} Farey angles needs to be selected when reconstructing images from a limited number of views. The digital angles that result from the quantisation of angular momentum (QAM) vectors may provide an alternative way to select angle subsets. This paper seeks first to identify the important properties of digital <b>angles</b> <b>sets</b> and second to demonstrate that the QAM vectors are indeed a candidate set that fulfils these requirements. Of particular note is the rare occurrence of degeneracy in the QAM angles, particularly for the half-integral angular momenta <b>angle</b> <b>sets...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Early systems {{included}} the US AN/MPQ-4, which used lobe switching to switch between two angles about 35 mils apart (about 2 degrees). Reflected signals were displayed on two B-scopes. Measurements from the B-scopes were copied into a ballistic calculator, which produced the X and Y {{location of the}} launcher. The UK Green Archer radar used a manual switch to flip between the vertical angles. The radar was normally left in the [...] "lower" [...] <b>angle</b> <b>setting,</b> while the operator waited for returns. When one was seen the switch {{was moved to the}} upper position, and the second return plotted. Ballistic calculation was performed by plotting the two points on an X-Y chart paper, and then moving mechanical cursors over the points. The rest of the calculation was carried out electronically.|$|E
50|$|A teleside {{converter}} (also {{known as}} a telephoto conversion lens or a front mount teleconverter) is a secondary lens which is mounted {{on the front of}} a photographic lens to increase the effective focal length of the lens they are attached to. They are used on cameras and video cameras with non-interchangeable lenses to increase the magnification of the image. Their design is usually that of an afocal Galilean telescope that alters the width of the entering beam of light without affecting the divergence of the beam, so they can change the effective focal length 1 to 3 times without increasing focal ratio. The down side to teleside converters is they will vignette the image on the wide <b>angle</b> <b>setting</b> if used on a zoom lens. Minimum Focal Length without vignetting will increase inline with higher power of the teleside converter. Before vignetting appears (four black corners), light fall-off will appear first and in general shooting this light fall-off may not be noticeable. The other concern is Minimum Working Distance, so the teleside converter cannot be used below minimum working distance and it depends on both the camera and the teleside converter being used.|$|E

5000|$|The machine used {{is called}} a {{squaring}} shear, power shear, or guillotine. The machine may be foot powered, less commonly hand powered, or mechanically or hydraulically powered. It works by first clamping the material with a ram. A moving blade then comes down across a fixed blade to shear the material. For larger shears the moving blade may be set on an angle or [...] "rocked" [...] in order to shear the material progressively {{from one side to}} the other; this angle is referred to as the shear <b>angle.</b> <b>Setting</b> the blade on an angle decreases the amount of force required, but increases the stroke. A 5 degree shear angle decreases the force by about 20%. The amount of energy used is still the same. The moving blade may also be inclined 0.5 to 2.5°, called the rake angle, to keep the material from becoming wedged between the blades. However, raking the blade compromises the squareness of the edge. The machine consists of a shear table, work-holding device, upper and lower blades, and a gauging device. The shear table is the part of the machinery that the workpiece rests on while being sheared. The work-holding device is used to hold the workpiece in place and keep it from moving or buckling while under stress. The upper and lower blades are the piece of machinery that actually do the cutting, while the gauging device is used to ensure that the workpiece is being cut where it is supposed to be.|$|E

It was found that 0 ° crank to crank setting (similar to conventional crank to crank <b>angle</b> <b>setting)</b> caused the prime mover VL (Normalized RMS = 0. 119) to fatigue more than BF (Normalized RMS = 0. 102).

In short, to increase the cycling performance by avoiding the fatigue to the main muscles, − 5 ° is the suggested as setting angle for the proposed crank design...|$|E

40|$|Three {{different}} methods for describing three dimensional joint angles {{are commonly used}} in biomechanics. The joint coordinate system and Cardan/Euler angles are conceptually quite different but are known to represent the same underlying mathematics. More recently the globographic method has been suggested as an alternative and this has proved particularly attractive for the shoulder joint. All three methods can be implemented {{in a number of}} ways leading to a choice of angle definitions. Very recently Rab has demonstrated that the globographic method is equivalent to one implementation of the joint coordinate system. This paper presents a rigorous analysis of the three {{different methods}} and proves their mathematical equivalence. The well known sequence dependence of Cardan/Euler is presented as equivalent to configuration dependence of the joint coordinate system and orientation dependence of globographic angles. The precise definition of different <b>angle</b> <b>sets</b> can be easily visualised using the globographic method using analogues of longitude, latitude and surface bearings with which most users will already be familiar. The method implicitly requires one axis of the moving segment to be identified as its principal axis and this can be extremely useful in helping define the most appropriate <b>angle</b> <b>set</b> to describe the orientation of any particular joint. Using this technique different <b>angle</b> <b>sets</b> are considered to be most appropriate for different joints and examples of this for the hip, knee, ankle, pelvis and axial skeleton are outlined...|$|R

40|$|A multi-element {{front wing}} of a formula student car was {{analyzed}} using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software STAR-CCM+. A {{number of cases}} were simulated in steady state to get {{an understanding of the}} interaction between the wing, the front wheels, the car body (monocoque) and the ground. Three different flap settings were simulated in three different heights in combinations with and without the following elements: Front wheels, monocoque, ground, front wing. The SST k-omega turbulence model was used with a polyhedral mesh. Chord Reynolds numbers were between 545 000 [...] 600 000. It was found that both the front wing operating isolated from other components and the wing operating in interaction with the front wheels and the monocoque responded with increased downforce in ground effect. Optimal ground height was dependent on flap setting: The mild configuration did not stall at any of the simulated heights, while the flaps on the aggressive configuration stalled close to the ground in the isolated case. Ground effect improved the downforce produced by the wing in free stream by up to 50. 7 %. Comparisons of the wing in mild and high downforce settings were done with and without the wheels. The wing-wheel interaction reduced the downforce produced in the mild flap <b>angle</b> <b>setting</b> by 20. 5 % by obstructing the flow, but increased the downforce of the high flap <b>angle</b> <b>setting</b> by 2. 2 % by introducing surface normal adverse pressure gradients, preventing boundary layer separation. The wing-monocoque interaction increased downforce in all simulated cases. The monocoque caused increased velocity and suction {{on the bottom of the}} symmetric center section, thus reducing the 3 D effects across the span toward the high-downforce section. This contributed to enhanced sectional lift coefficient along the complete span, increasing downforce produced by the wing with low flap angles and wheels behind by 14. 3 % and correspondingly for the high flap angle an increase of 10. 8 %. </p...|$|E
