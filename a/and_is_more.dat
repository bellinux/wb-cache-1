5|$|Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen {{described}} the false chanterelle in 1781, noting both its resemblance with the true chanterelles and people's propensity to confuse them. The false chanterelle was then {{placed in the}} genus Clitocybe, but it was later observed that its forked gills and dextrinoid spores indicated a relationship to Paxillus. Genetic analysis has confirmed that {{it belongs to the}} order Boletales <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> closely related to boletes.|$|E
5|$|Carex binervis has an oceanic distribution, {{occurring}} only {{in areas}} of high rainfall, from Finland and Norway, through the British Isles, Germany, Belgium and France, to Spain and Portugal. Within the British Isles, Carex binervis has a westerly and northerly distribution, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> abundant in the Scotland, Wales and Ireland than in England. Plants from Morocco that were previously referred to C.binervis are now treated as a separate species, C.paulo-vargasii.|$|E
5|$|Coyotes were {{occasionally}} {{eaten by}} trappers and mountain men during the western expansion. Coyotes sometimes {{featured in the}} feasts of the Plains Indians, and coyote pups were eaten by the indigenous people of San Gabriel, California. The taste of coyote meat has been likened {{to that of the}} wolf, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> tender than pork when boiled. Coyote fat, when taken in the fall, has been used on occasion to grease leather or eaten as a spread.|$|E

5|$|Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (FES) is a stout {{produced}} by the Guinness Brewery, an Irish brewing company owned by Diageo, a drinks multinational. First brewed by Guinness in 1801, FES was designed for export, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> heavily hopped than Guinness Draught and Extra Stout, and typically has a higher alcohol content (at around 7.5% ABV), which gives it a more bitter taste. The extra hops were intended as a natural preservative for the long journeys the beer would take by ship.|$|E

5|$|Other {{possibilities}} exist, as well. For example, immunohistochemistry usually utilizes an antibody {{to one or}} more proteins {{of interest}} that are conjugated to enzymes yielding either luminescent or chromogenic signals that can be compared between samples, allowing for localization information. Another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose (or other material) gradients using isopycnic centrifugation. While this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest, it does increase the likelihood, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> amenable to large-scale studies.|$|E

5|$|The Port of Portland began {{efforts in}} 1997 {{to reduce the}} flow of {{aircraft}} deicing chemicals from the airport into the waterway, though it still diverted concentrated chemicals (mostly glycol) directly into the slough during rare times of reservoir overflow. By 2012, the Port had completed work on an enhanced system that collects, stores, and treats the chemicals, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> likely to direct runoff to the Columbia River than the slough.|$|E

5|$|Thorium fuels {{also result}} in a safer and better-performing reactor core because thorium dioxide has a higher melting point, higher thermal conductivity, lower {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> stable chemically than the now-common fuel uranium dioxide, which can further oxidise to triuranium octoxide (U3O8).|$|E

5|$|A thorium atom has 90 electrons, {{of which}} four are valence electrons. Three atomic orbitals are {{theoretically}} {{available for the}} valence electrons to occupy: 5f, 6d, and 7s. Despite thorium's position in the f-block of the periodic table, it has an anomalous 6d27s2 electron configuration in the ground state, as the 5f and 6d subshells in the early actinides are very close in energy, {{even more so than}} the 4f and 5d subshells of the lanthanides: thorium's 6d subshells are lower in energy than its 5f subshells, because its 5f subshells are not well-shielded by the filled 6s and 6p subshells and are destabilised. Such unusual behaviour is due to relativistic effects, which become stronger {{near the bottom of the}} periodic table, specifically the relativistic spin–orbit interaction. The closeness in energy levels of the 5f, 6d, and 7s energy levels of thorium result in thorium almost always losing all four valence electrons and occurring in its highest possible oxidation state of +4. This is different from its lanthanide congener cerium, for which +4 is the highest possible state but +3 also plays an important role <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> stable. Thorium is much more similar to the transition metals zirconium and hafnium than to cerium in its properties such as ionisation energies and redox potentials, and hence also in its chemistry: this transition-metal-like behaviour is the norm in the first half of the actinide series.|$|E
5|$|Abdominal pain(38.1%), lack of fecal {{production}} or constipation(21.1%), nausea(17.0%), diarrhea(8.2%), bloating(4.1%), and dental decay(3.4%) are also described as common symptoms in day-to-day life. These symptoms {{are not necessarily}} prevalent during regurgitation episodes, and can happen at any time. Weight loss is often observed (42.2%) at an average loss of 9.6kilograms, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> common {{in cases where the}} disorder has gone undiagnosed {{for a longer period of}} time, though this may be expected of the nutrition deficiencies that often accompany the disorder as a consequence of its symptoms. Depression has also been linked with rumination syndrome, though its effects on rumination syndrome are unknown.|$|E

50|$|Ligands {{also affect}} the {{magnitude}} of Δ splitting of the d orbitals according to their field strength as described by the spectrochemical series. Strong-field ligands, such as CN− and CO, increase the Δ splitting <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to <b>be</b> low-spin. Weak-field ligands, such as I− and Br− cause a smaller Δ splitting <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to <b>be</b> high-spin.|$|R

5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which would immediately succumb to the cold and drown in water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E
5|$|As pH {{rises above}} 0 the above yellow hydrolyzed species form {{and as it}} rises above 2–3, reddish-brown hydrous iron(III) oxide {{precipitates}} out of solution. Although Fe3+ has an d5 configuration, its absorption spectrum is not like that of Mn2+ with its weak, spin-forbidden d–d bands, because Fe3+ has higher positive charge <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> polarizing, lowering the energy of its ligand-to-metal charge transfer absorptions. Thus, all the above complexes are rather strongly colored, with the single exception of the hexaquo ion – and even that has a spectrum dominated by charge transfer in the near ultraviolet region. On the other hand, the pale green iron(II) hexaquo ion 2+ does not undergo appreciable hydrolysis. Carbon dioxide is not evolved when carbonate anions are added, which instead results in white iron(II) carbonate being precipitated out. In excess carbon dioxide this forms the slightly soluble bicarbonate, which occurs commonly in groundwater, but it oxidises quickly in air to form iron(III) oxide that accounts for the brown deposits present in a sizeable number of streams.|$|E
5|$|Because Ratatouille is {{intended}} to be a romantic, lush vision of Paris, giving it an identity distinct from previous Pixar films, director Brad Bird, producer Brad Lewis and some of the crew spent a week in the city to properly understand its environment, taking a motorcycle tour and eating at five top restaurants. There are also many water-based sequences in the film, one of which is set in the sewers <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> complex than the blue whale scene in Finding Nemo. One scene has Linguini wet after jumping into the Seine to fetch Remy. A Pixar employee (Shade/Paint department coordinator Kesten Migdal) jumped into Pixar's swimming pool wearing a chef's uniform and apron to see which parts of the suit stuck to his body and which became translucent from water absorption.|$|E
