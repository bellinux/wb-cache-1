40|$|Water is {{considered}} {{as an important}} degradation factor for PV-modules by causing hydrolysis of polymeric components, corrosion of glass and of metallic components like grids and interconnectors. The type <b>approval</b> <b>testing</b> of PV-modules according to the IEC standards takes water into account {{by means of the}} so called Damp-Heat test and the Frost-Thaw test. The test-conditions were designed long time ago and initially meant to reflect the service life of a module, but the type <b>approval</b> <b>testing</b> is not applicable for prediction of long-term durability behaviour, but a qualification test for the assurance of a minimum quality level. Basically absorption and mass transport of water into and within the module has to be considered. These phenomena depend on the ambient climate of the PV-module in use, the design (back-sheet, glass-glass, all polymer, e. g.), the operation conditions (rack-mounted, on rooftop, building integrated) and the material composition. We try to evaluate t est conditions that are primarily based on the stresses occurring during the operation at specific locations by using monitored climatic data and applying phenomenological models for the estimation of the moisture load at the surfaces of PV-modules as function of the module temperature. A simple time transformation function was used for the design of appropriate damp-heat tests as accelerated service life tests. The evaluated testing times differ up to an order of magnitude for different climatic locations, depending on the kinetics of the dominant degradation processes...|$|E

European type <b>approval</b> <b>tests</b> (on the NEDC—New European Driving Cycle) of hybrid vehicles measure emission levels of the same magnitude of conventional cars in the same market segment; emitting and consuming slightly less but far from the promised halving of consumption and elimination of emissions [1, 2].

40|$|In {{a marine}} evacuation, {{passengers}} {{may find themselves}} in lifeboats, liferafts or in the water. Survival is more challenging in cold regions and a person’s ability to survive until rescue depends on many factors, including the amount of protection the evacuees have against the cold, {{as well as the}} quality of breathing air in liferafts and lifeboats that are enclosed. Currently, international regulations do not provide specific thermal protection and ventilation performance criteria for lifeboats or liferafts. In addition, methods for <b>approval</b> <b>testing</b> of immersion suits have not been standardised and there is resistance in certain jurisdictions to the use of thermal manikins because regulating authorities are unsure of the correspondence between manikins and human. This paper provides an overview of several projects that have been completed and one ongoing by the Maritime and Arctic Survival Scientific and Engineering Research Team (MASSERT) to address the knowledge gaps in these areas. The results contribute relevant knowledge to close these gaps and are being used to advance international standards. They also show the value of using thermal manikins in combination with numerical models to predict the performance of lifesaving appliances when it is impractical or ethically unacceptable to conduct experiments with humans. The tools developed are being applied to create performance criteria and evaluate the performance of Arctic survival gear. ...|$|E

40|$|Child {{restraint}} systems (CRS) {{are used for}} protection of the child in case of car accident. These systems {{have been found to}} have a difficult installation process that in many cases can cause greater loads on the child and as a consequence can lead to an increased risk of injury and a reduction in safety. The problems are even more significant in cases of families with two or more children and in small cars with lack of available space. Misuse and its causes are identified from literature as well as from surveys and market research. The design guidelines are gathered from existing CRS designs. Currently available automotive and CRS fastening systems are studied. A specific methodological approach is used for project development. A new concept for a child restraint system is introduced. The main aims are the design proposal of a double ISOFIX base for two children, reduction in the misuse of the CRS, improving the user experience and achieving technological, societal and environmental contributions. The second aspect is to verify the structure of the double base by means of preliminary finite-element analysis using the case of a frontal collision in accordance to current <b>approval</b> <b>testing</b> procedures. Al 2024 is chosen for design by the material selection performed in order to optimize the structure in relation to strength and weight.

40|$|Spring traps require welfare {{approval}} in the UK, but break-back traps, for rats and mice, and mole traps are exempt. Mechanical tests {{on a wide}} range of these unregulated traps showed that impact momentum varied 6 - 8 -fold, and clamping force varied 4 - 5. 5 -fold, among traps for use with each of rats, mice and moles. There was considerable overlap between the strongest mouse traps and weakest rat traps for each force. A post-mortem and x-ray study of 50 spring-trapped moles revealed that none sustained damaged skulls or cervical vertebrae; they were, therefore, unlikely to have become unconscious immediately. Some moles appeared superficially to have broken spines, but in fact they had incurred only soft tissue damage and no broken vertebrae. The primary identifiable cause of death in trapped moles was acute haemorrhage. A minority of moles may have asphyxiated, but evidence for this was weak. Given the scale of rat, mouse and mole trapping in the UK, the wide range of unregulated traps available, and doubts raised regarding their humaneness, this research suggests an urgent imperative to abandon a puzzling double standard, and thereby to reduce the welfare impact of unregulated spring traps for rats, mice and moles. There is a strong case that all traps should be subjected to comparable approval standards. In the meantime, we propose a Voluntary Trap Approval (VTA) scheme under which manufacturers would submit traps for <b>approval</b> <b>testing</b> in the same way as for regulated traps.

40|$|Software {{systems are}} {{becoming}} more complex, not least in their Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), which presents challenges for existing testing practices. Pressure to reduce time to market leaves less time for manual testing and increases the importance of test automation. Previous research has identified several generations of automated GUI-based test approaches with different cost-benefit tradeoffs. Whilst test automation provides fast quality feedback it {{can be associated with}} high costs and inability to identify defects not explicitly anticipated by the test designer. TextTest is a capture-replay tool for GUI-based testing with a novel approach that overcomes several of the challenges experienced with previous approaches. Firstly the tool supports <b>Approval</b> <b>Testing,</b> an approach where ASCII-art representations of the GUI's visual state are used to verify correct application behavior at the system level. Secondly it records and replays test scripts in a user defined domain specific language (DSL) that is readable by all stakeholders. In this paper we present a three phase industrial case study that aims to identify TextTest's applicability in industrial practice. The paper reports that the tool is associated with (1) low script development costs due to recording functionality, (2) low maintenance costs, on average 7 minutes per test case, (3) better defect finding ability than manual system testing, (4) high test case execution performance (In this case 500 test cases in 20 minutes), (5) high script readability due to DSL defined scripts, and (6) test suites that are robust to change (In this case 93 percent per iteration). However, the tool requires a higher degree of technical skill for customization work, test maintainers need skills in designing regular expressions and the tool's applicability is currently restricted to Java and Python based applications...|$|E

An urban remote sensing data set collected in 2008 {{is used to}} define the dynamic relationship between vehicle specific power and exhaust emissions, {{across a range of}} vehicle ages, engine capacities, and fuel types. The New European Driving Cycle is synthesized from the remote sensing data using vehicle specific power to characterize engine load, and the results compared with official published emissions data from vehicle type <b>approval</b> <b>tests</b> over the same driving cycle.
