5|$|Given {{began the}} 2016–17 season as first choice 'keeper due to Butland being sidelined. On 27 August 2016, he conceded an unfortunate own goal in a 1–0 away defeat to Everton. Given had palmed a Leighton Baines penalty onto the post but the ball rebounded against his head <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> the line. After conceding four goals against Tottenham Hotspur and Crystal Palace in September, Given lost {{his place in}} the side to Lee Grant. He was {{released}} by Stoke {{at the end of the}} 2016–17 season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} years of the war, the tide was in favour of the regency, until, in the summer of 1342, Kantakouzenos was forced to flee to the court of Stefan Dušan of Serbia. However, from 1343 onwards, with the aid of his friend, Umur Beg of Aydin, Kantakouzenos began to reverse the situation. With the initial support of Stefan Dušan, Kantakouzenos regained much of Macedonia, and despite his failure to take Thessalonica, his Turkish allies enabled him to return to his old stronghold of Didymoteicho in Thrace. Gradually, Apokaukos's {{supporters}} abandoned him, including his son Manuel, who deserted his post at Adrianople <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> to the Kantakouzenos camp.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{building}} reactors in 1943. A group was created in Bacher's P Division, the P-7 (Water Boiler) Group, {{under the leadership of}} Donald Kerst, that included Charles P. Baker, Gerhart Friedlander, Lindsay Helmholtz, Marshall Holloway and Raemer Schreiber. Robert F. Christy from the T-1 Group provided support with the theoretical calculations, in particular, a calculation of the critical mass. He calculated that 600 grams of uranium-235 would form a critical mass in a tamper of infinite size. Initially it was planned to operate the Water Boiler at 10kW, but Fermi and Samuel K. Allison visited in September 1943, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> the proposed design. They pointed out the danger of decomposition of the uranium salt, and recommended heavier shielding. It was also noted that radioactive fission products would be created {{that would have to be}} chemically removed. As a consequence, it was decided that the Water Boiler would only run at 1kW until more operating experience had been accumulated, and features needed for high power operation were shelved for the time being.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only were}} the {{advisers}} in danger from the enemy, {{but also from the}} men they commanded or advised. On 20 July 1919, like a number of other advisers subsequently, Brown was murdered by his men when they mutinied <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> to the Bolsheviks. While Brown was the only Australian to be killed, there was at least one other major mutiny among the White forces during this period, and several other Australians had narrow escapes. With these incidents becoming increasingly common, and with the ineffectiveness of such a small force in influencing the outcome of the civil war, in March 1919 {{the decision was made to}} withdraw the force. As all faith had been lost in the reliability of locally raised units, this could only be safely completed with the provision of a covering force, and until this could be raised the NREF was condemned to endure the harsh Russian winter.|$|E
5|$|Galland's time in Argentina {{was running}} out. For his services, {{he was awarded}} a pilot's wings badge and the title Honorary Argentine Military Pilot. Later that year Galland left South America. By that time, he had begun writing his autobiography, The First and the Last (Die Ersten und die Letzten), and it was {{published}} in 1954 by Franz Schneekluth. It was a best-seller in 14 languages and sold three million copies. It was very well received by the RAF and USAF as a frank and honest statement. Galland returned to Germany and was approached by a commissioner for Chancellor Konrad Adenauer for the purpose of joining the new Bundeswehr now that West Germany was to join NATO as a military power. Galland joined with Steinhoff, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> the proposal. However, France objected to West Germany's proposal for a pan-European defence pact and chose to go its own way. That changed the organisation structure of the German armed forces. Galland got on with his life as the months rolled by. In 1956 Josef Kammhuber, the leader of the German Nachtjagdgeschwader (Night Fighter Wings) during the war, became the new commander-in-chief of the Bundesluftwaffe. Galland now accepted he had been turned down as a potential leader of, or in, the new air force. Galland suspected that it was more to do with his technically illegal departure from Germany in 1948 and his association with Argentina, a state which was on poor terms with the United States, the dominant partner of NATO.|$|E

25|$|The final between Australia and England {{was played}} at Sydney's Telstra Stadium {{in front of}} a crowd of 82,957. Australia opened the scoring after they decided to run a penalty instead of kicking for touch. Lote Tuqiri beat England's right wing, Jason Robinson, to a high cross-field kick <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> for the first try, but Elton Flatley was not able to add the conversion.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} season, 1935–36 Drake scored {{seven in}} a single match against Aston Villa at Villa Park on 14 December 1935, a club record and top flight record that also still stands.

Drake {{would go on to}} win the FA Cup in 1935–36 (scoring the only goal in the final) and the League again in 1937–38.|$|E

25|$|The second Battle of Herdonia (210 BC) {{was fought}} {{to lift the}} Roman siege of that allied city. Hannibal caught the proconsul Gnaeus Fulvius Centumalus off guard during his siege of Herdonia and {{destroyed}} his army in a pitched battle with up to 13,000 Romans dead of 20,000. The defection of the allied city of Salapia in Apulia in 210 BC was achieved by treachery: the inhabitants massacred the Numidian garrison <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> to the Romans.|$|E

25|$|Strādnieks (The Worker) (1906–1919) — Official {{organ of}} the Latvian socialist movement, {{published}} in Boston. The Latvian socialists of the Boston area were among the earliest and most energetic supporters of the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> en bloc to the Communist Party of America {{in the summer of}} 1919. During World War I the paper was banned by the U.S. postal authorities and was replaced by Atbalss, which also fell afoul of postal authorities. In 1918, a publication called Biļetens (The Bulletin) was launched, continuing until the postal ban was lifted and Strādnieks briefly reappeared in 1919.|$|E
25|$|Ormonde {{lost most}} of the English and Protestant Royalist troops under his command when they mutinied, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> to Cromwell in May 1650. This left him with only the Irish Catholic forces, who distrusted him greatly. Ormonde was ousted from his command in late 1650 and he {{returned}} to France in December 1650. A synod held in at the Augustinian abbey in Jamestown, County Leitrim, repudiated the Duke and excommunicated his followers. In Cromwell's Act of Settlement 1652, all of Ormonde's lands in Ireland were confiscated and he was excepted from the pardon given to those Royalists who had surrendered by that date.|$|E

25|$|Mansa Mahmud IV {{tried to}} take {{advantage}} of the situation with the support of Fulbe and Bambara chiefs. In 1599, the mansa led this army in a march on Battle of Jenné. The rulers of Jenné called on the Moroccan garrison of Arma in Timbuktu for reinforcements. The other obstacle to the mansa's success was his betrayal by a major ally prior to the battle. The reasoning behind this betrayal, according to Mandinka oral traditions was that Mahmud IV did not have the support of Mali's traditional generals, the Farim-Soura and Sankar-Zouma. This major ally of the mansa abandoned him at the last moment <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> to the Moroccans and advised them on what to expect from the mansa's army. Despite their amazement at the size of the mansa's force, the Arma won the battle after a violent bombardment.|$|E
25|$|Jimmy Lauderdale, on 139, {{was a bit}} {{puzzled by}} all this. But they were all new to the four-track, and he {{supposed}} it was all right. Then the signalman gave them a green flag from the box, so Lauderdale started pulling forward {{to see what he}} wanted. But the guard had spotted the down signals all off; thoroughly alarmed, he began running forward and shouting, and presently Lauderdale heard him and stopped. But it was too late then to do anything. The express was 200 yards away, coming 40 miles an hour. No. 139's crew cleared out <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> the wall, and the express went head on into 139. It was quite a bad smash. The guard and two passengers were killed. The fireman and another passenger died later. The driver escaped with severe bruising. There was very nearly another collision immediately after, for a Caley mineral from Lesmahagow was coming on the Down Goods line. Its driver saw the crash occur and managed to pull up just in time.|$|E
25|$|The Svans {{are usually}} {{identified}} with the Soanes mentioned by Greek geographer Strabo, who placed them {{more or less in}} the area still occupied by the modern-day Svans. The province had been a dependency of Colchis, and of its successor kingdom of Lazica (Egrisi) until AD 552, when the Svans took advantage of the Lazic War, repudiated this connection <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>over</b> to the Persians. The Byzantines wanted the region, for if they secured its passes, they could prevent Persian raids on the border areas of Lazica. With {{the end of the war}} (562), Svanetia again became part of Lazica. Then, the province joined the Kingdom of Abkhazia to form a unified monarchy which was incorporated into the Kingdom of Georgia in the early 11th century. Svanetia became a duchy (saeristavo) within it, governed by a duke (eristavi). The province’s Orthodox culture flourished particularly during the Georgian “golden age” under Queen Tamar (r. 1184-1213), who was respected almost as goddess by the Svanetians. The legend has it that the duchy was annually visited by Tamar. The Svans had been known as fierce warriors for centuries. Their inflatable war banner was named Lemi (Lion) because of its shape.|$|E
