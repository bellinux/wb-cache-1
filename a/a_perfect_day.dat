5|$|Clara {{explored}} eastern religions for a {{few years}} and then eventually became a Christian Scientist, although there is some question as to her seriousness and commitment to it. She authored a book on the subject: Awake to <b>a</b> <b>Perfect</b> <b>Day,</b> published by Citadel Press, NYC, 1956 After originally objecting to the release of her father's Letters from the Earth in 1939, she changed her stance shortly before her death in 1962 and allowed them to be published. She also published biographies of both her father (My Father, Mark Twain in 1931) and of her first husband (My Husband: Gabrilowitsch in 1938).|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures and endeavors {{of the title}} {{character}} and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In the episode, SpongeBob is determined to have <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>day.</b> But much to his disappointment, however, the day refuses to go at all as he planned. Each of his friends has a different problem of his/her own, so he sets out to help them while spoiling his own agendas. As soon as SpongeBob realizes that he has forfeited (and sacrificed) his perfect day to help his friends, they rally around him with their thanks and congratulations. Eventually, SpongeBob realizes {{that he has had}} his best day ever after all.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} the {{evacuation}} promised <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>day.</b> The sun rose out of a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. The sky was hopelessly blue {{and the sight of}} Hirta, green and pleasant as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7am boarded the Harebell. Although exhausted by the strain and hard work of the last few days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.|$|E
60|$|We {{rode the}} {{remaining}} {{portion of our}} way in somber mood, although we all {{agreed that it was}} a colorful finish of <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> day--a <b>day</b> to be recalled in after years with a tender heart-ache.|$|R
5000|$|... "We're a Natural" [...] - Inspired by the Byron Bay surroundings, this hippy {{and spiritual}} lyric captures the earth-child's vision of perfect simplicity. Warm sand and deep {{twilight}} after <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> beach <b>day</b> birthed <b>a</b> happy, energetic celebration of life au naturel.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> clear, <b>perfect</b> <b>day,</b> with <b>a</b> {{gentle breeze}} and a sunny sky, greeted Princess Ozma as she wakened next morning, {{the anniversary of}} her birth.

500|$|Science and Health {{he called}} [...] "strange and frantic and incomprehensible and uninterpretable," [...] {{and argued that}} Eddy had not written it herself. [...] "There is nothing in Christian Science that is not explicable," [...] he wrote, [...] "for God is one, Time is one, Individuality is one, and {{may be one of}} a series, one of many, as an {{individual}} man, individual horse; whereas God is one, not one of a series, but one alone and without an equal." [...] Eddy apart, Twain felt ambivalent toward the premise of mind-cure, arguing that [...] "the thing back of it is wholly gracious and beautiful..." [...] while maintaining a healthy skepticism towards the validity of mind cure adding, [...] "These things are true, or they are not. If they were true seventeen and eighteen and nineteen centuries ago {{it would be difficult to}} satisfactorily explain why or how or by what argument that power should be nonexistent in Christians now."< His daughter Clara Clemens became a Christian Scientist and wrote a book about it, Awake to <b>a</b> <b>Perfect</b> <b>Day</b> (1956).|$|E
500|$|In 1881, Coolbrith's poetry was {{published}} in book form, entitled <b>A</b> <b>Perfect</b> <b>Day,</b> and Other Poems. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, after Coolbrith's publisher sent him a copy, said [...] "I know that California {{has at least one}} poet." [...] Of the poems, he said [...] "I have been reading them with delight." [...] Yale poet Edward Rowland Sill, professor at the University of California and a keen critic of American literature, gave Coolbrith a letter of introduction that he wished her to send to publisher Henry Holt. It said, simply, [...] "Miss Ina Coolbrith, one of our few really literary persons in California, and the writer of many lovely poems; in fact, the most genuine singer the West has yet produced." [...] Quaker poet and former abolitionist John Greenleaf Whittier wrote to Coolbrith from Amesbury, Massachusetts, to share his opinion that her [...] "little volume" [...] of poetry, [...] "which has found such favor with all who have seen it {{on this side of the}} Rocky mountains", should be republished on the East Coast. He told her [...] "there is no verse on the Pacific Slope which has the fine quality of thine." ...|$|E
500|$|Andretti {{appeared}} in victory lane {{and later on}} the podium to celebrate his first victory {{of the season in}} front of the crowd; the win earned him $100,000. He was delighted to take the victory: [...] "Just an awesome day, <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>day</b> for Team Motorola, they did an awesome job,", and, [...] "This is a big one, I'll tell you that. After the first lap, I thought the race was over for us. But it was a hard fought race". Tagliani, who finished in second place, stated it was a [...] "good day" [...] for his team and hoped he could continue his recent successes. Third-place finisher Fern√°ndez said it was a [...] "great day" [...] for himself and his team but was disappointed as he felt he could have won the race because of a problem at his final pit stop. However, he felt if his team kept building their momentum, and he believed he could challenge for more strong finishes and race victories. Zanardi was pleased with his fourth-place finish, saying it was more fun than at the previous round (the Grand Prix of Cleveland) and felt his engineers were helping him to build a competitive car despite his poor qualifying performances.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> autumn <b>day,</b> and {{all four}} of the lads were in the best of spirits. To be sure, {{the fact that they were}} leaving home to be gone for several months sobered them a trifle; but all were eager to find out what was in store for them rather than to give thought to what had been left behind.|$|R

500|$|Ringo and Donna later {{get back}} {{together}} and {{to prove that he}} loves her, Ringo proposes. In June 2010, it was revealed that the 6000th episode celebrations would see the wedding of Donna and Ringo. News.com reported that producers hoped that the wedding would [...] "recreate the magic" [...] of Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) and Charlene Mitchell's (Kylie Minogue) 1987 wedding. Robbie said she had [...] "big shoes to fill", but she was honoured to be working on her biggest storyline since she arrived. Clark said that Donna and Ringo had made the decision {{that they are going to}} be with each other for life and that they are [...] "going to be solid from now on". On the wedding day, Donna's car breaks down and she is forced to ride in the back of Lucas Fitzgerald's (Scott Major) truck. Donna walks down the aisle to Ringo's version of [...] "Suddenly", the original song played at Scott and Charlene's wedding. Clark added [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>day,</b> but I can't promise they'll live happily ever after." [...] Donna and Ringo became the 36th couple to get married on the show. A month later, Ringo is knocked down by Stephanie Scully's (Carla Bonner) motorcycle and he dies. Donna is devastated and she stays in her room. Steph comes to visit her and as she is apologising, Donna gets up and hugs her. Of Donna's reaction, Robbie said [...] "Donna is almost in a state of confusion and insists that the whole thing was an accident. Donna is just numb and she doesn't know what to feel." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Streets of Arklow" [...] {{describes}} <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>day</b> in [...] "God's green land" [...] and is {{a tribute}} to the Wicklow town visited during this vacation trip. The opening lines of the song: [...] "And as we walked through the streets of Arklow, oh the colours of the day warm, and our heads were filled with poetry, in the morning coming onto dawn" [...] were said to [...] "contain the thematic seeds of the whole album: nature, poetry, god, innocence re-found and love lost" [...] by PopMatters critic John Kennedy.|$|E
2500|$|Bruce May {{negotiated}} {{a deal with}} Telstar Records, a company that pushed its products heavily with major advertising and hyping campaigns. McTell was persuaded to record an album which mixed his own material and 'classic songs' such as [...] "Penny Lane", [...] "Morning Has Broken" [...] and [...] "Scarborough Fair". The result, At the End of <b>a</b> <b>Perfect</b> <b>Day,</b> released late in 1985, was one of McTell's least satisfactory recordings. It was [...] "a totally commercial venture and a miserable failure," [...] he said later; [...] "...while I was reluctant to do it, the possibility of getting the kind of back-up that Telstar were offering {{was too good to}} miss." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was back}} next {{morning with a}} glue-pot, and divided his time between boiling {{it up on the}} kitchen stove and {{wandering}} about the house in search of things to stick. Its unaccountable disappearance during his absence in another room did much to mar the harmony of <b>an</b> otherwise <b>perfect</b> <b>day.</b> First of all he searched the house from top to bottom; then, screwing up his features, he beckoned quietly to Mrs. Chinnery.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> winter <b>day,</b> with <b>a</b> dull golden {{glow in the}} sky {{and only}} a faint breeze from the north blowing. On the ground the snow lay to the depth of ten inches or a foot, but the wind of the week past had almost cleared the ice on the river. Here and there were long ridges of snow across the glare, but that was all.|$|R
6000|$|It was <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> spring <b>day,</b> and the Homestead {{was at its}} best. The entire demesne {{was without}} a weed, and the {{blooming}} berry patches, the sprouting asparagus beds and the budding grape vines all come in for the eminent sculptor's enforced inspection, until at last with a yawn of unconcealed boredom he turned away. [...] "You seem to like your slavery," [...] he remarked to Zulime, a note of comical accusation in his voice.|$|R
2500|$|Armstrong often {{stated that}} he was born on July 4, 1900, [...] "For many years {{it was thought that}} Armstrong was born in New Orleans on July 4, 1900, <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>day</b> for the man who wrote the musical Declaration of Independence for Americans of this century. But the estimable writer Gary Giddins {{discovered}} the birth certificate that proves Armstrong was born Aug. 4, 1901," [...] a date that has been noted in many biographies. Although he died in 1971, {{it was not until the}} mid-1980s that his true birth date, August 4, 1901, was discovered by the researcher Tad Jones through the examination of baptismal records. At least one other biography treats the July 4th birth date as a myth.|$|E

60|$|It was <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>day,</b> {{with a warm}} breeze {{blowing up}} from the Potomac River. Not a cloud ruffled the sky, and the spring birds filled the air with their melody.|$|E
60|$|Music of Song, in {{the full}} power of it, meaning perfect {{education}} in all art of the Muses and of civilized life: the mystery of its concord is taken for the symbol of that of <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> state; one <b>day,</b> doubtless, of the perfect world. So prophesies the last corner stone of the Shepherd's Tower.|$|R
60|$|When {{good weather}} and good sport came together, the boats were {{accustomed}} to range far and wide, and often {{did not return to}} the schooner until long after dark. But for all that it was <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> hunting <b>day,</b> Chris noted a growing anxiety {{on the part of the}} sailing-master. He paced the deck nervously, and was constantly sweeping the horizon with his marine glasses. Not a boat was in sight. As sunset arrived, he even sent Chris aloft to the mizzen-topmast-head, but with no better luck. The boats could not possibly be back before midnight.|$|R
50|$|Exactly 20 days later, on May 29, Halladay {{threw the}} 20th perfect game in Major League history, {{defeating}} the Florida Marlins 1-0. This achievement {{marked the first}} time in the modern (post-1900) era that two perfect games were pitched in the same season. In 1880, both Lee Richmond and John Montgomery Ward both hurled <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> game five <b>days</b> apart. It was also the first perfect game for the Phillies since Jim Bunning's Father's <b>Day</b> <b>perfect</b> game on June 21, 1964, beating the New York Mets, 6-0.|$|R

6000|$|... "And {{now for the}} {{treasure}} hunt!" [...] cried Sam, who {{was among the first}} to awaken. [...] "It's just <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>day,</b> and we ought to accomplish a good deal, if we set to work right after breakfast." ...|$|E
60|$|It was <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>day,</b> {{cloudless}} and still. There was {{peace in}} the air. James, having finished his milk, began to wash himself. A squirrel climbed cautiously down from a linden tree. From the orchard came the murmur of many bees.|$|E
50|$|Flatland BMX {{occupies}} a position somewhat {{removed from the}} rest of freestyle BMX.

2500|$|Continuing {{during this}} time were her writing credits for other performers: [...] "Saint Forgiveness" [...] (Champlin/Gaitsch/Champlin) written for Bruce Gaitsch [...] "Aphasia" [...] Album in 1997; [...] "Runaway Love" [...] (Champlin/Caruso/Matkosky) {{recorded}} by both Rita Coolige on her [...] "Thinkin' About You" [...] Release [...] (1998) and was a top 40 Billboard Hit for Chris Ledoux's on his [...] "One Road Man".

60|$|The {{visit to}} Avebury {{had been a}} great success. It had been <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> springtime <b>day,</b> and the little inn had been delighted at the reappearance of Sir Richmond's car so soon after its departure. Its delight was {{particularly}} manifest in the cream and salad it produced for lunch. Both Miss Grammont and Miss Seyffert displayed an intelligent interest in their food. After lunch they had all gone out to the stones and the wall. Half a dozen sunburnt children were putting one of the partially overturned megaliths to a happy use by clambering {{to the top of}} it and sliding on their little behinds down its smooth and sloping side amidst much mirthful squealing.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>day.</b> The {{sun shone}} brightly, {{and there was}} just enough breeze to keep the {{atmosphere}} fresh and exhilarating. Captain Putnam was to accompany the students on horseback, and the teachers had already gone off with the wagons.|$|E
6000|$|This anthem, sung out of full hearts, {{remains on}} our minds {{as the last}} {{perfection}} of <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>day.</b> For myself, I am not ashamed to own that it made me weep like a child. Indeed, I cannot write of it now as I would; it unmans me so! ...|$|E
60|$|Orders {{were given}} to cast off, and in a very few minutes the bark {{was on her way}} from San Francisco Bay toward the Golden Gate. It was <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>day,</b> and by nightfall the harbor was left behind and land became a mere speck in the distance.|$|E
60|$|Three days later, leaving Gyp {{with his}} sister, {{he went back}} to Mildenham to start the {{necessary}} alterations in the cottages. He had told no one he was coming, and walked up from the station on <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> June <b>day,</b> bright and hot. When he turned through the drive gate, into the beech-tree avenue, the leaf-shadows were thick on the ground, with golden gleams of the invincible sunlight thrusting their way through. The grey boles, the vivid green leaves, those glistening sun-shafts through the shade entranced him, coming from the dusty road. Down in the very middle of the avenue, a small, white figure was standing, as if looking out for him. He heard a shrill shout.|$|R
60|$|I've often {{wondered}} since then how these murderer fellows manage {{to keep in}} shape while they're contemplating their next effort. I had a much simpler sort of job on hand, {{and the thought of}} it rattled me to such an extent in the night watches that I was <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> wreck next <b>day.</b> Dark circles under the eyes--I give you my word! I had to call on Jeeves to rally round with one of those life-savers of his.|$|R
60|$|Tunbridge Wells, that charming purgatory {{where the}} retired prepare their souls {{for a more}} {{permanent}} retirement, was dreaming on its hills in long rows of adequate villas. Its commons and woods had remained unscorched, so that the retired had not to any extent deserted it, that August, for the sea. They still shopped in the Pantiles, strolled the uplands, or flourished their golf-clubs in the grassy parks; they still drank tea in each other's houses and frequented the many churches. One could see their faces, as it were, goldened by their coming glory, like the chins of children by reflection from buttercups. From every kind of life they had retired, and, waiting now for <b>a</b> more <b>perfect</b> <b>day,</b> were doing their utmost to postpone it. They lived very long.|$|R
