5|$|Hilary was {{probably}} born around 1110, and was likely of low birth, {{but nothing is}} known of his ancestry. His brother was <b>a</b> <b>canon</b> of Salisbury Cathedral, and they both {{may have come from}} around Salisbury. Hilary served as a clerk for Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, and as Dean of the church of Christchurch in Twynham, Hampshire, probably receiving both offices through the influence of Henry of Blois. Christchurch was a collegiate church of secular clergy, or clergy who were not monks, and Hilary was dean of the church by 1139. He was educated as <b>a</b> <b>canon</b> lawyer, and was an advocate, or lawyer, in Rome in 1144. While in Rome, he also served in the papal chancery, or writing office, in 1146. Some of his coworkers in the chancery were Robert Pullen, John of Salisbury, and Nicholas Breakspear who later became pope, as Adrian IV.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} his recovery, Zwingli's opponents remained in the minority.

He also retained his post as the people's priest of the Grossmünster.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin was a royal justiciar in 1203, {{as well as}} the {{custodian}} of {{the vacant}} diocese of Lincoln. He was a royal clerk as well as <b>a</b> <b>canon</b> of Wells, becoming <b>a</b> <b>canon</b> and a deacon by 1200. The previous bishop of Wells died in 1205, and on 3 February 1206, Jocelin was elected bishop. He was consecrated on 28 May 1206, at Reading by Bishop William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise of London. It is unclear if the cathedral chapters of Bath and of Wells took the action on their own, or if King John was {{the driving force behind the}} election.|$|E
50|$|In <b>a</b> mensuration <b>canon</b> (also {{known as}} <b>a</b> prolation <b>canon,</b> or <b>a</b> {{proportional}} <b>canon),</b> the follower imitates the leader by some rhythmic proportion. The follower may double the rhythmic {{values of the}} leader (augmentation or sloth canon) or it may cut the rhythmic proportions in half (diminution canon). Phasing involves the application of modulating rhythmic proportions according to a sliding scale. The cancrizans, and often the mensuration canon, take {{exception to the rule}} that the follower must start later than the leader; that is, in <b>a</b> typical <b>canon,</b> <b>a</b> follower cannot come before the leader (for then the labels 'leader' and 'follower' should be reversed) or {{at the same time as}} the leader (for then two lines together would constantly be in unison, or parallel thirds, etc., and there would be no counterpoint), whereas in <b>a</b> crab <b>canon</b> or mensuration canon the two lines can start at the same time and still respect good counterpoint.|$|R
5000|$|In music, <b>a</b> prolation <b>canon</b> (also called <b>a</b> mensuration <b>canon</b> or {{proportional}} <b>canon)</b> is <b>a</b> type of <b>canon,</b> <b>a</b> {{musical composition}} wherein the main melody {{is accompanied by}} one or more imitations of that melody in other voices. Not only do the voices sing or play the same melody, they do so at different speeds (or prolations, a mensuration term that dates to the medieval and Renaissance eras). Accompanying voices may enter either simultaneously or successively. If voices extend the rhythmic values of the leader (for example, by doubling all note values), a procedure known as augmentation, the resulting canon can be called <b>an</b> augmentation <b>canon</b> or canon by augmentation (canon per augmentationem) or sloth canon (recalling the slow movement of the sloth). Conversely, if they reduce the note values in diminution, it can be called <b>a</b> diminution <b>canon</b> or canon by diminution (canon per diminutionem).|$|R

5|$|Also {{a younger}} son, Gebhard had {{prepared}} for an ecclesiastical career with a broad, Humanist education; {{apart from his}} native German, he had learned several languages (including Latin, Italian, French), and studied history and theology. After studying at the universities of Dillingen, Ingolstadt, Perugia, Louvain and elsewhere, he began his ecclesiastical career in 1560at Augsburg. His conduct at Augsburg caused some scandal; the bishop, his uncle, petitioned the Duke of Bavaria to remonstrate with him about it, which apparently led to some improvement in his behavior. In 1561, he became a deacon at Cologne Cathedral (1561–77), <b>a</b> <b>canon</b> of St. Gereon, the basilica in Cologne (1562–67), <b>a</b> <b>canon</b> in Strassburg (1567–1601), in Ellwangen (1567–83), and in Würzburg (1569–70). In 1571, he became deacon of Strassburg Cathedral, a position he held until his death. In 1576, by papal nomination, he also became provost of the Cathedral in Augsburg. Similar to his opponent, these positions brought him influence and wealth; they {{had little to do}} with his priestly character.|$|E
5|$|Breton died on {{or before}} 12 May 1275, when the {{custodian}} of the bishopric was given orders to seize Breton's estate because of debts {{owed to the}} king. These debts dated back over 20 years, to his time as sheriff. A Thomas le Breton, presumably a relative, was <b>a</b> <b>canon</b> at Hereford Cathedral from 1273, and probably owed his office to John.|$|E

5|$|Conrad of Abenberg {{came from}} {{the family of the}} Counts of Abenberg-Frensdorf, and had many {{distinguished}} relatives in Germany. He was born around 1075, son of Count Wolfram I von Abenberg. His mother was probably the daughter of Heinrich I, viscount of Regensburg. Conrad had two older brothers, Otto and Wolfram. He was raised for a clerical career at the court of the Emperor Henry IV, where {{he was a member of}} the court chapel. He became <b>a</b> <b>canon</b> in Hildesheim.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Ösel-Wiek Bishop, every canon was {{supposed}} to lead a chaste and virtuous life {{according to the rules}} of the monastery. Access of women to the Episcopal Castle was forbidden by threat of death. A legend tells that <b>a</b> <b>canon</b> fell in love with an Estonian girl and brought secretly the maiden into the castle. She hid by dressing as a choirboy and remained a secret for a long time, but when the bishop visited Haapsalu again, the young singer caught his attention and he ordered an investigation of the singer's gender.|$|E
5|$|In March 1901 Lang was {{appointed}} suffragan Bishop of Stepney and <b>a</b> <b>canon</b> of St Paul's Cathedral.

5|$|Jocelin of Wells (died 19 November 1242) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Bath (and Glastonbury). He was {{the brother of}} Hugh de Wells, who became Bishop of Lincoln.

During King John of England's dispute with Pope Innocent III, Jocelin at first {{remained}} with the king, but after the excommunication of John in late 1209, Jocelin went into exile.

5|$|Later in the year, in April, {{he was one}} of four Scottish envoys sent to Canterbury for {{abortive}} {{talks with}} the English and French.
