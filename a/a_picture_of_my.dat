6000|$|... "I {{know about}} that," [...] said Whopper. [...] "Once I {{tried to take}} <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> cousin {{standing}} by a well. The glare of the sun got on the plate just where her head ought to have been, so she was headless." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{looked at}} him. I saw {{unaffected}} terror struggling {{on his face}} with unaffected shame; he was smiling pitifully and wetting his lip with his tongue, like a detected schoolboy. I drew <b>a</b> brief <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> state, and asked him what I was to do.|$|R
5000|$|Chosen by Rozi Abdul Razak, {{according}} to Siti, the album title is said [...] "to <b>picture</b> <b>a</b> fragment <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life's tales, stories and experiences every day".|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} in Danish at the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix in 2001, titled [...] "Der står et billede af dig på mit bord" [...] ("There is <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> you on <b>my</b> table").|$|R

60|$|This honest, {{friendly}} way {{of treating}} me unlocked all the sluices of my passions. He broke into my very soul by it; and I unravelled all the wickedness {{of my life}} to him. In a word, I gave him an abridgment of this whole history; I gave him <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> conduct for fifty years in miniature.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, sir, it mustn't {{belong to}} you any longer. It won't {{do for you}} to have <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> girl to hang up in your painting-room for all your friends to come and make their jokes about, nor yet to make a show of it in any of your exhibitions. My {{daughter}} has been a fool, and I can't help it. If you'll tell me what's the cost, I'll pay you; then I'll have the picture home, and I'll treat it as it deserves." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song is {{actually}} about my wonderful {{first trip to}} St. Petersburg in 2010, but I wanted the video to tell a dramatised version of what happened on my nightmare return the following year. I actually think the positivity of the song and negativity of the video combine really well and help create <b>an</b> overall <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> Russian experiences. Emil's great work {{has a lot to}} do with that though. Baz Francis ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I've Got <b>a</b> <b>Picture</b> <b>of</b> Us on <b>My</b> Mind" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Bobby Harden that was {{originally}} performed by American country music artist Loretta Lynn. It was released as a single in September 1979 via MCA Records.|$|R
6000|$|... "**-- **--!" [...] {{exploded}} Jones to me. [...] "Do {{you think}} more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> than <b>of</b> saving <b>my</b> life?" [...] Having expressed this not unreasonable protest, he untied the lasso that Emett had made fast {{to a small}} sapling.|$|R
6000|$|This is <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{mother as}} she {{appeared}} to all who knew her. In my individual case there was more, a secret bond of union between us, since she best understood my feeling for Nature and sense of beauty, and recognized that in this I was nearest to her. Thus, besides and above the love of mother and son, we had a spiritual kinship, and this was {{so much to me}} that everything beautiful in sight or sound that affected me came associated with her to my mind. I have found this feeling most perfectly expressed in some lines to the Snowdrop by our lost poet, Dolben. I am in doubt, he wrote, ...|$|E
6000|$|Joe Moss {{was delighted}} with the Haneys, for they talked of their native West as people should talk. They were as {{absolute}} in their convictions as a Kentuckian. For them {{there was no other}} [...] "God's country," [...] and as it was his latest dream to go West and [...] "do a big thing on a cliff or something" [...] he put off every other engagement to enjoy their racy speech. He said at the first sitting: [...] "I've had an idea of working the Thorwaldsen trick: find some fine site out there, some wall of rock close to the railway, and hew out a monster grizzly or mountain lion. The railway could then advertise it, you see; trains could stop there 'five minutes to permit a view of Moss's Lion'; they could use a cut of it on all their folders. If there was a spring near by they could advertise the water and bottle it, <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> lion on the label. Ah, it is a fine scheme!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} pages will contain <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> vagrant life, intermixed with specimens, generally brief and slight, of that great mass of fiction to which I gave existence, {{and which has}} vanished like cloud-shapes. Besides the occasions when I sought a pecuniary reward, I was accustomed to exercise my narrative faculty wherever chance had collected a little audience idle enough to listen. These rehearsals were useful in testing the strong points of my stories; and, indeed, the flow of fancy soon came upon me so abundantly that its indulgence was its own reward, though the hope of praise also became a powerful incitement. Since I shall never feel the warm gush of new thought as I did then, let me beseech the reader to believe that my tales were not always so cold as he may find them now. With each specimen {{will be given a}} sketch of the circumstances in which the story was told. Thus my air-drawn pictures will be set in frames perhaps more valuable than the pictures themselves, since they will be embossed with groups of characteristic figures, amid the lake and mountain scenery, the villages and fertile fields, of our native land. But I write the book for the sake of its moral, which many a dreaming youth may profit by, though it is the experience of a wandering story-teller.|$|E

60|$|I {{imagined}} she {{had always}} intended me a pleasant welcome; but the certain fervour of sincerity, which I could not help remarking, flowed from an unexpected source. Captain Nares, with a kindness for which I can never be sufficiently grateful, had stolen a moment from his occupations, driven to call on Mamie, and drawn her <b>a</b> generous <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> prowess at the wreck. She {{was careful not to}} breathe a word of this interview, till she had led me on to tell my adventures for myself.|$|R
6000|$|Today comes blessedly {{your letter}} of the 18th, written after the receipt of my cable to you in answer to your {{preceding}} one of the 6th (after you had heard from Robert Allerton of my illness.) You will have been reassured further--I mean beyond my cable--by a letter I lately despatched to Bill and Alice conjointly, in which I told them of my good and continued improvement. I am going on very well, increasingly so--in spite of my having to reckon with so much chronic pectoral pain, now so seated and settled, of the queer [...] "falsely anginal" [...] but none the less, when it is bad, distressing order.... Moreover too it is astonishing with how much pain one can with long practice learn constantly and not too defeatedly to live. Therefore, dearest Alice, don't {{think of this as}} too black <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> situation: it is so much brighter a one than I have thought at certain bad moments and seasons of the past that I should probably ever be able to paint. The mere power to work in such measure as I can is an infinite help to a better consciousness--and though so impaired compared to what it used to be, it tends to grow, distinctly--which by itself proves that I have some firm ground under my feet. And I repeat to satiety that my conditions here are admirably helpful and favouring.|$|E
6000|$|Edmund {{thought it}} right that {{both he and}} Gerald should attend her funeral. Lord Marchmont, whose wife stood in the same {{relationship}} to her, met them in London, and they all went together to Torquay, instead of making the intended visit to Oakworthy. Gerald was obliged to return to Eton on the following day, without coming to Oakworthy; but, {{to make up for}} it, he wrote to his Writer from Torquay, and his letter ended thus,--"Now I have a capital bit of news for you. Old aunt Jessie has done what I shall venerate her for ever after--left every scrap of her property to Edmund, except a legacy or two to her servants, <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> father to me, and some queer old-fashioned jewels to you and Selina. The will was made just after I was born; so it was to make up to Edmund for my cutting him out of Fern Torr. You may suppose how Lord Marchmont and I shook hands with him. It is somewhere about £20,000; there is good news for you! He is executor, and has got to be here a day or two longer; but Lord Marchmont and I set off by the first train to-morrow. I shall look out for Lionel, tell him, in case he is too blind to see me. Can't you come with him to the station, and have one moment's talk?" ...|$|E

The second single, [...] "Pregnant Again", peaked at No. 35, {{and the third}} single, [...] "Naked in the Rain", peaked at No. 30.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was thinking, {{coming up}} the hill, Loo," [...] he said, {{bursting}} into the sitting-room, pantingly, [...] "of writing something {{about the future of}} the hill! How it will look fifty years from now, all terraced with houses and gardens!--and right up here a kind of Acropolis, don't you know. I had quite <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> it in <b>my</b> mind just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} be a' aviator, too; I think a' aviator is braver than anybody. I'd rather be a' aviator than a general or a {{policeman}} or anybody. I got <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> you in <b>my</b> scrap-book--you got a funny hat like Cousin Bobby wears when he plays football in it. Shall I get you the picture in my scrap-book?... Honest, will you give me another?" ...|$|R
5000|$|During a Reddit AMA session, The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman distanced {{himself from}} Survival Instinct due to its {{negative}} reception, citing his more direct involvement in the Telltale game, and remarking that [...] "I'm pretty sure there's an AMC logo before the title of that game and not <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> face. If there was <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> face {{in front of the}} logo, then I'd be completely responsible for that." [...] Kirkman, however, felt that the ability to play as Daryl was [...] "at least cool".|$|E
5000|$|... (added by HJ Arruda Pacheco July 28, 2017) I am {{a little}} confused. How can there exist <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{ancestor}} as photography was invented after Manuel Arruda da Camara's death. First known photo was around 1825.|$|E
5000|$|Henry Miller was {{particularly}} partial to Houghton's Hudson Rejoins the Herd, {{of which he}} wrote: [...] "What so startled me, in reading this book, was that it appeared to give <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> most intimate life during a certain crucial period. The outer circumstances were 'disguised,' but the inner ones were hallucinatingly real. I {{could not have done}} better myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Bes, when yonder king {{told me that}} I must die, fear {{filled me}} who {{did not wish to}} die thus, and after the fear came a {{blackness}} in <b>my</b> mind. Then <b>of</b> a sudden in that blackness I saw <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Tanofir, <b>my</b> great uncle, seated in a sepulchre looking towards the East. Moreover I heard him speak, and to me, saying, 'Shabaka, my foster-son, fear nothing. You are in great danger but it will pass. Speak to the great King all that rises in your heart, for the gods of Vengeance make use of your tongue and whatever you prophesy to him shall be fulfilled.' So I spoke the words you heard and I feared nothing." ...|$|R
30|$|<b>A</b> {{photographer}} took <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> broken clay {{pots and}} published in the newspaper with a headline ‘Garib Ka Fridge Tut Gaya’ (Refrigerator of the Poor has Broken). I thought; he is calling my pot a fridge. We also want a fridge but do not have money to purchase one… so…why don’t I make a clay fridge for myself… and I started experimenting with clay to make a clay refrigerator that did not need electricity to cool.|$|R
6000|$|The {{following}} Sonnet, transcribed in {{the foregoing}} Letter, {{has not been}} printed. [...] "It puts in," [...] he says, [...] "no claim to poetry, but it is <b>a</b> most faithful <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> feelings on <b>a</b> very interesting event." [...] See the Letter to Mr. Poole of 24th September, 1796. This Sonnet shows in a remarkable way how little the Unitarianism, which Mr. C. professed at this time, operated on his fundamental [...] "feelings" [...] as a catholic Christian.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a proponent}} of art for art's sake, Whistler professed to be perplexed and annoyed by the insistence of others upon viewing {{his work as a}} [...] "portrait." [...] In his 1890 book The Gentle Art of Making Enemies, he wrote: Take the picture of my mother, {{exhibited}} at the Royal Academy as an [...] "Arrangement in Grey and Black." [...] Now that is what it is. To me it is interesting as <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mother; but what can or ought the public do to care about the identity of the portrait? ...|$|E
5000|$|Owens Valley history, {{including}} {{construction and}} impact of the Los Angeles Aqueduct project, or [...] "Owens Valley Aqueduct," [...] is described in Museum displays. Today, land {{on all sides of}} the museum is property of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, of the City of Los Angeles. Photographs and docents show and explain that the Valley included large tracts of agricultural land; from the Paiute Native American era, through pioneer days, to the Aqueduct 'water wars era' that began diversions of water in the early 20th century to Los Angeles. A tour docent, sharing a vintage black-and-white photograph, explained [...] "This is <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mom's apple orchard." ...|$|E
5000|$|Chavanel {{was born}} in Châtellerault, France, {{although}} his family roots are in Spain. His great-grandparents were from Huesca, in the Aragon region. His grandfather {{was born in}} Barcelona and moved to Châtellerault during the Spanish Civil War. Other {{members of the family}} still live in Aragon. It is the Spanish link that gives Chavanel the double name of Chavanel Albira, although he uses it only on official forms.He said: [...] "Last year 2007, when the Vuelta was in Zaragoza, I got to know the cousin of mine using a journalist as the translator and she gave me <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> grandfather when he was young.

60|$|And first I am {{bound to}} present <b>a</b> {{faithful}} <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own peculiar nature relatively to sleep. I do not doubt that were every individual to imitate me, {{it would be}} found that among many circumstances peculiar to their individual nature, a sufficiently general resemblance would be found to prove the connexion existing between those peculiarities and the most universal phenomena. I shall employ caution, indeed, as to the facts which I state, that they contain nothing false or exaggerated. But they contain no more than certain elucidations <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own nature; concerning the degree in which it resembles, or differs from, that of others, I am by no means accurately aware. It is sufficient, however, to caution the reader against drawing general inferences from particular instances.|$|R
