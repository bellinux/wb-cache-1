40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This study comprises SPSS syntax code {{that can be used}} with pre- 2009 Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Annual Population Survey (APS) Special Licence Access datasets to recode Local Authority/Unitary Authority (UA/LA) geographic variables into the new UA/LA <b>classification</b> <b>areas</b> used after the 2009 local government reorganisation, when nine new UAs were created. This syntax is referenced in Volume 3 (current Variable Details) of the LFS User Guide (page 42 in the 2013 edition, page 47 in the 2011 edition) as follows: "In April 2009, there was a reorganisation of local government that created nine new unitary authorities (UAs). Five of these UAs were created from existing county councils and their district councils. The remaining four were created by splitting Cheshire and Bedfordshire into two - each along existing district council boundaries. All nine unitary authorities will, therefore, be aggregates of existing local authorities. To apply these changes to back data syntax can be used to recode the above variables into new variables representing these new classifications. This syntax can be obtained by contacting the UK Data Archive. This syntax will need to be used for all files up to AJ 10 data. From AJ 10 data onwards we will be producing quarterly datasets with the new UA variables on them. " While the data files are subject to Special Licence Access, the syntax file is subject to standard End User Licence (EUL) access conditions, as it does not contain any data, only SPSS command syntax code. Users should note that the syntax is of use only to users of the Special Licence Access LFS and APS studies, as the standard EUL versions do not contain UA/LA geographic variables.

Open geodemographics provides such information (because it is not constrained by commercial interests) and is an important development for applied social research that also seeks to understand and to explain the roots causes or processes that generate aggregate spatial patterns of social behaviour and attitudes.
