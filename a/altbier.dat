2500|$|Düsseldorf is {{well known}} for its <b>Altbier,</b> a hoppy beer which {{translates}} as old [...] beer, a reference to the pre-lager brewing method of using a warm top-fermenting yeast like British pale ales. Over time the Alt yeast adjusted to lower temperatures, and the Alt brewers would store or lager the beer after fermentation, leading to a cleaner, crisper beer. The name [...] "altbier" [...] first appeared in the 19th century to differentiate the beers of Düsseldorf from the new pale lager that was gaining a hold on Germany.|$|E

50|$|<b>Altbier</b> (German: old beer) is a {{style of}} beer brewed in the {{historical}} region of Westphalia and around the city of Düsseldorf, Germany. Its name comes from it being top-fermented, an older method than the bottom fermentation of other lagered beers.|$|E
50|$|The {{market leader}} {{in terms of}} volume sold is Diebels, a brand within the InBev brewing empire. Other mass-market brewers of <b>Altbier</b> include the Radeberger Gruppe under the brands Schlösser Alt and Hansa Alt. These are complemented by small breweries, {{predominantly}} based in Düsseldorf.|$|E
50|$|<b>Altbier</b> is the {{dominant}} beer variety in the Lower Rhine region {{and especially in the}} towns of Düsseldorf, Krefeld and Mönchengladbach. The first producer to use the name Alt to contrast its top fermenting beer with the bottom fermenting kinds was the Schumacher brewery of Düsseldorf, which opened in 1838.|$|E
50|$|<b>Altbier</b> {{is usually}} a dark copper colour. It is {{fermented}} at a moderate temperature using a top-fermenting yeast which gives its flavour some fruitiness, but matured at a cooler temperature, which gives it a cleaner and crisper taste more akin to lager beer styles than is the norm for top-fermented beers, such as British pale ale.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} pub-breweries in Düsseldorf which brew <b>Altbier</b> on the premises: Füchschen, Schumacher, Schlüssel, Uerige and Brauerei Kürzer. Four {{of the five}} are in the {{historic}} centre of Düsseldorf (Altstadt); the other (Schumacher), between the Altstadt and Düsseldorf Central railway station (Hauptbahnhof), also maintains an establishment in the Altstadt, Im Goldenen Kessel, {{across the street from}} Schlüssel.|$|E
5000|$|Some <b>Altbier</b> breweries have a {{tradition}} of producing a stronger version, Sticke Alt, coming from a local dialect word meaning [...] "secret". Originally a special reserve beer intended for the brewers' own consumption, it is generally a seasonal or special occasion brew and is stronger in taste and alcohol as well as darker than the brewery's standard output.|$|E
50|$|<b>Altbier</b> {{has been}} {{produced}} {{in the city of}} Venlo in the Netherlands since at least 1753. Venlo is on the border to Germany approximately 50 km (30 miles) from Düsseldorf. The beer was produced up until the Second World War but then had a hiatus until its revival in 1983. It is produced by the Lindeboom brewery, who bought the recipe in 2001.|$|E
50|$|A Stange (stick or rod) is a {{cylindrical}} {{glass that}} is traditionally used for Kölsch beer. A Becher (tumbler), traditionally used for <b>Altbier,</b> {{is similar to}} a Stange but is slightly shorter and much thicker. Stangen are carried by placing them into holes in a special tray called a Kranz (wreath). In Cologne Stanges are usually served by traditional waiters called Köbes.|$|E
