5|$|Radar {{results from}} SHARAD {{suggested}} that features termed lobate debris <b>aprons</b> (LDAs) contain {{large amounts of}} water ice. Of interest {{from the days of}} the Viking Orbiters, these LDA are <b>aprons</b> of material surrounding cliffs. They have a convex topography and a gentle slope; this suggests flow away from the steep source cliff. In addition, lobate debris <b>aprons</b> can show surface lineations just as rock glaciers on the Earth. SHARAD has provided strong evidence that the LDAs in Hellas Planitia are glaciers that are covered with a thin layer of debris (i.e. rocks and dust); a strong reflection from the top and base of LDAs was observed, suggesting that pure water ice makes up the bulk of the formation (between the two reflections). Based on the experiments of the Phoenix lander and the studies of the Mars Odyssey from orbit, water ice is known to exist just under the surface of Mars in the far north and south (high latitudes).|$|E
5|$|Runway 09R/27L, the {{original}} and primary runway, is {{long enough to be}} able to receive the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger aircraft. Originally a taxiway, runway 09L/27R was inaugurated in February 2012. Its shorter length and width allow it to handle smaller aircraft such as the Airbus A340 and Boeing 747. It is mainly used when runway 09R/27L is undergoing maintenance, and as air traffic to the airport rises it will be used more often. North of these runways are the three parking aprons: the cargo, passenger terminal and MRO <b>aprons.</b> The passenger terminal apron contains parking stands on both the north and south sides of the terminal.|$|E
5|$|The {{crucifix}} measures 448cm x 390cm and {{consists of}} five basic physical components; a vertical board reaching from the base to the cymatium onto which Christ is nailed, two horizontal cross-arms, and two vertical pieces acting as <b>aprons</b> adjacent to the central board. There are another eight minor pieces; mostly terminals, bases or framing devices. The structure is reinforced by two full length vertical battens. The horizontal cross-arms extend the full width of his outstretched body and are slotted into ridges in the vertical supports. The timber would have been cut and arranged by carpenters before Cimabue applied his design and paintwork.|$|E

25|$|The airport has one {{terminal}} and a 30,000 square-meter <b>apron.</b> The <b>apron</b> has two taxiways. The <b>apron</b> {{is capable of}} supporting 4 Airbus A320s and eight large general aviation planes simultaneously. There are also plans to add another <b>apron</b> across the old <b>apron,</b> {{so that it can}} accommodate many aircraft at the same time.|$|R
50|$|Three main <b>apron</b> areas {{exist on}} the airfield. The largest <b>apron</b> area is located around the Table Mountain Aviation FBO buildings. The FBO <b>apron</b> area is home to 38 tie-downs {{as well as the}} fuel tanks and {{provides}} access to Taxiway R {{to the west of the}} <b>apron</b> and Taxiway S to the north of the <b>apron.</b> The second largest <b>apron</b> area is located in the midfield area of the airfield, south of Runway 19. This <b>apron</b> area is home to 76 tie downs. The third <b>apron</b> area is located east of the Table Mountain Golf Course and provides space for 5 tie downs, and is ideal for golfers that fly to the Airport.|$|R
5|$|The early 1990s saw a {{rapid rise}} in land {{values in the}} Tel Aviv area {{following}} the massive immigration wave from the ex-Soviet Union and the rapid economic growth fueled by the peace prospects in 19931996 and subsequent hi-tech boom. This brought the issue of relocation back to light. Despite this, however, in 1997, Sde Dov was declared an International Airport for private flights. In the future, the Main Terminal, the aircraft parking <b>aprons</b> and the aircraft hangars will be transferred to an area near the Tel Baruch Beach which will enable {{the construction of new}} traffic routes to North Tel Aviv.|$|E
5|$|Visitors are {{encouraged}} to view the house from the outside and have their photo taken—in fact, the visitors center provides many sizes of similar <b>aprons</b> and jackets worn by the original painting's models. The adjacent American Gothic House Center, completed in 2007, contains exhibits about the painting, artist Grant Wood, and the community around the house. Each June, the city of Eldon holds its Gothic Days festival, {{a celebration of the}} painting and rural life in Eldon in the 1930s. Starting in 2015, tours began in {{the first floor of the}} home. The Gothic House is not handicap accessible.|$|E
5|$|But it {{was also}} during the mint's second tour of duty that women began to find work at the New Orleans Mint. Several women workers were sent from the Philadelphia Mint to teach those in New Orleans how to adjust money. About this time, the mint {{employed}} forty-four women. Thirty-nine worked as adjusters – employees who weighed the unstamped coin planchets {{to make sure they}} were the proper weight before coining. These women would sit at long narrow tables, filing the planchets down to the proper weight, wearing special <b>aprons</b> with pouches attached to the sleeves and the waist to catch the excess dust. Five women served as counters and packers before the coins were shipped to Washington, D.C. Some women were eventually employed at the coining presses.|$|E

50|$|The kilt pin is a {{piece of}} {{jewellery}} that is usually worn on the lower corner of the outer <b>apron</b> of a kilt. Its function is to prevent the <b>apron</b> falling or blowing open, by adding weight to the outer <b>apron</b> and is commonly seen as a form of decoration. It does not pin the outer <b>apron</b> to the inner fabric, which is a common misconception.|$|R
25|$|In {{the design}} of a {{spillway}} and <b>apron,</b> the engineers select the point at which a hydraulic jump will occur. Obstructions or slope changes are routinely designed into the <b>apron</b> to force a jump at a specific location. Obstructions are unnecessary, as the slope change alone is normally sufficient. To trigger the hydraulic jump without obstacles, an <b>apron</b> is designed such that the flat slope of the <b>apron</b> retards the rapidly flowing water from the spillway. If the <b>apron</b> slope is insufficient to maintain the original high velocity, a jump will occur.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{discusses}} analytical {{models for}} <b>apron</b> capacity estimation. Two existing analytical <b>apron</b> models are described and simple {{extension of the}} models is suggested. Instead of expressing <b>apron</b> capacity by one number, <b>apron</b> capacity envelope is proposed to illustrate capacity changes, or <b>apron</b> capability to accept different demand, in respect to mix of dominant users in demand. Similarly to runway capacity envelope that contains information on capacity for one runway system configuration and given fleet mix, for different arrival/departure shares, <b>apron</b> capacity envelope provides information on capacity for one <b>apron</b> configuration (in respect to stand size and policy of usage) and given fleet mix, for different shares of dominant users in demand. Depending on the policy of stand assignment users can be airlines/alliances and/or different combinations of origin/destination of flight and level of security required (e. g. Schengen/non-Schengen) ...|$|R

25|$|In 1954, Palma de Mallorca's runway was {{extended}} and asphalted, and also had brand new taxiways and <b>aprons</b> added near it. This made the airport {{able to serve}} more airlines and more types of aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In 1973 {{the airport}} was {{expanded}} again to handle bigger aircraft. The main runway was lengthened to 2500m, taxiways were widened and <b>aprons</b> enlarged. This mostly offset {{the negative effects}} of the 1973 oil crisis, passenger volume remained the same and cargo operations expanded.|$|E

50|$|The bib <b>apron</b> (also {{known as}} the “French chefs apron” or a “barbecue apron”) has been worn for centuries. The bib apron's humble {{beginnings}} began when people used scraps of fabric to make a bib-like covering that slipped over the neck and tied at the back. The bib apron’s intuitive design and full coverage have made it a popular <b>apron</b> for tradesmen and people in low-economic classes since the 1880s—and maybe even earlier. In the 1960s—when women no longer wanted an <b>apron</b> that symbolized domestic ideals—the bib <b>apron</b> became the most-used <b>apron</b> and is now offered in a multitude of variations, colors, detailing and fabrications.|$|R
