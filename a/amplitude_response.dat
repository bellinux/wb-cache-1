40|$|To {{understand}} {{the principles of}} operation of the striatum {{it is critical to}} elucidate the properties of the main excitatory inputs from cortex and thalamus, as well as their ability to activate the main neurons of the striatum, the medium spiny neurons (MSNs). As the thalamostriatal projection is heterogeneous, we set out to isolate and study the thalamic afferent inputs to MSNs using small localized injections of adeno-associated virus carrying fusion genes for channelrhodopsin- 2 and YFP, in either the rostral or caudal regions of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei (i. e. the central lateral or parafascicular nucleus). This enabled optical activation of specific thalamic afferents combined with whole-cell, patch-clamp recordings of MSNs and electrical stimulation of cortical afferents, in adult mice. We found that thalamostriatal synapses differ significantly in their peak <b>amplitude</b> <b>responses,</b> short-term dynamics and expression of ionotropic glutamate receptor subtypes. Our results suggest that central lateral synapses are most efficient in driving MSNs to depolarization, particularly those of the direct pathway, as they exhibit large <b>amplitude</b> <b>responses,</b> short-term facilitation and predominantly express postsynaptic AMPA receptors. In contrast, parafascicular synapses exhibit small <b>amplitude</b> <b>responses,</b> short-term depression and predominantly express postsynaptic NMDA receptors, suggesting a modulatory role, e. g. facilitating Ca 2 +-dependent processes. Indeed, pairing parafascicular, but not central lateral, presynaptic stimulation with action potentials in MSNs, leads to NMDA receptor- and Ca 2 +-dependent long-term depression at these synapses. We conclude that the main excitatory thalamostriatal afferents differ in many of their characteristics and suggest that they each contribute differentially to striatal information processing. © 2012 The Physiological Society...|$|R

However, in such a case, it can for example occur that the maximum peak of the <b>amplitude</b> frequency <b>response</b> occurs at a frequency which is not in this grid. A consequence is that the overshoot will not be determined well for the system. In this paper we will present a method such that this can not occur. We will augment the uncertainty set with an additional uncertain parameter. This uncertain parameter will cover the frequencies which are not covered by the grid. This allows us to do a robustness analysis for a range of frequencies. In this case we are sure that we do not miss any crucial information with respect to the <b>amplitude</b> frequency <b>response</b> lying in between the frequencies in the grid. We illustrate this using two simulation examples...|$|R
