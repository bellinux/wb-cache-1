5|$|<b>As</b> <b>before,</b> once {{opposition}} to the triumvirate was crushed, it started to tear at itself. The triumvirate expired {{on the last day}} of 33 BC and was not renewed in law and in 31 BC, war began again. At the Battle of Actium, Octavian decisively defeated Antony and Cleopatra in a naval battle near Greece, using fire to destroy the enemy fleet.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>before,</b> {{the uniform}} buttons could also {{reflect the state}} loyalties of an individual.

5|$|Despite Clarke and Wavell's {{successes in}} deception, the North African {{campaign}} was turning against the Allies. In 1941 Erwin Rommel had taken command of Axis forces and won early victories. Churchill replaced Wavell with Claude Auchinleck. Clarke's new commander {{was impressed with}} Wavell's setup, so 'A' Force {{and the rest of}} Middle Eastern Command continued to operate <b>as</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E

The voiceless glottal fricative (...) is normally written as h, but appears as x after the consonants s, z, and digraphs ending in h to avoid phonological ambiguity. The voiced velar fricative is written <b>as</b> y <b>before</b> i and e (where it is palatalized [...] ), <b>as</b> w <b>before</b> o (where it is labialized [...] ), and <b>as</b> gh <b>before</b> a.|$|R

5|$|The race saw the {{introduction}} of a new qualifying system. <b>As</b> <b>before,</b> qualifying was divided into three parts.

5|$|A new points {{system was}} {{implemented}} in the 2013 Continental Cup of Curling. The total of points available was 60 points, compared to the total of 400 points used in previous years. The mixed doubles, singles, and team games were worth one point each, and ties were worth one half point each to both teams. The skins games were worth {{a total of five}} points. All games were eight ends long, and there were no extra ends. Also, six mixed doubles games and six singles competition games were played, <b>as</b> <b>before.</b> However, there were eighteen team games instead of the previous twelve, and there were six skins games instead of the previous eight.|$|E

On 4th-and-1 from the Virginia Tech 30-yard line, Ryan attempted a pass that fell incomplete, turning {{the ball over}} on downs. As a result of pressure applied by the Boston College defense, the Hokies continued to have difficulty moving the ball.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Proms {{continued}} much <b>as</b> <b>before.</b> The second {{halves of}} concerts still featured piano-accompanied songs rather than serious classical music. Chappell's, having taken over {{sponsorship of the}} Proms and spent £35,000 keeping the Queen's Hall going during the war, wished to promote songs published by the company. The management of Chappell's were also less enthusiastic than Wood and Newman about promoting new orchestral works, {{most of which were}} not profitable.|$|E

However, although {{the campaign was}} initially boosted by a £1,000 donation from Octavia Hill, fundraising was slow, and by October 1898 only £2,000 had been raised. The churchwardens and the MPGA began to consider ideas for initiatives which would publicise the campaign and provide a reason to justify preserving {{the whole of the}} park.|$|E
