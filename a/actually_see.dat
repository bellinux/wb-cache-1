5|$|In Sicily, the {{decision}} was taken not just for fashion and appearance {{but also because it}} would minimise the damage to property and life likely to be caused in future quakes. In 1693, the cramped housing and streets had caused buildings to collapse together like dominoes. Although after the earthquake the avenues were broadened and the density of housing was lowered overall, cramped and narrow areas of housing still remained, posing a hazard for the poor. Architecturally and aesthetically, the big advantage of the new order of town planning was that unlike many Italian towns and cities, where one frequently encounters a monumental Renaissance church squeezed terrace fashion between incongruous neighbours, in urban Baroque design one can step back and <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> the architecture in a more conducive setting in relation to its proportions and perspective. This is most notable in the largely rebuilt towns of Caltagirone, Militello in Val di Catania, Catania, Modica, Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa, and Scicli.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{arrived in}} the European Theater of Operations in early February, coming {{under the command of}} the First Allied Airborne Army, and Major General Chapman was informed that there was a possibility that the division would be required to conduct airborne operations during the closing stages of the Battle of the Bulge. However, the campaign in the Ardennes ended before the division could be transported there. The next chance for the 13th to participate in an airborne operation, and to <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> combat, was in March 1945 when the Allies had penetrated into Germany itself and reached the River Rhine. A few weeks before the division was to participate in a combat jump over the Rhine it was reorganized, after a conference by the War Department had decided that a more efficient composition for an airborne division was two Parachute Infantry Regiments and only a single Glider Infantry Regiment. Subsequently, the 517th Parachute Infantry Regiment, a veteran unit that had served in Italy, Southern France and the Ardennes, joined the division in early March, and the 88th Glider Infantry Regiment was combined into the 326th Glider Infantry Regiment that remained as the division's sole glider-based element. The 517th had recently fought during the Ardennes campaign, and had received a Presidential Unit Citation for its actions.|$|E

25|$|The {{final phase}} {{of the war was}} the guerrilla phase where many Boer {{soldiers}} turned to Guerrilla tactics such as raiding infrastructure or communications lines. Many Canadian soldiers did not <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> combat after getting shipped over to South Africa as many arrived {{around the time of the}} signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902.|$|E
25|$|The Division never {{achieved}} anything near full division status, but did <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> some combat. The 38th SS Division was {{at first}} named Junkerschule because of its formation from {{the members of the}} SS-Junkerschule Bad Tölz. It was then renamed to Nibelungen from the medieval poem of the name Nibelungenlied made famous by Richard Wagner in his opera Ring des Nibelungen.|$|E
25|$|The 1971 squad was {{notable for}} a pair of firsts in Alabama {{football}} history. This was the first team that African Americans contributed as members of the Alabama varsity squad, with John Mitchell being the first to <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> playing time. 1971 also marked the first season the Crimson Tide utilized the wishbone offense that Alabama became noted for throughout the remainder of Bryant's tenure as head coach at Alabama.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of AH 1423 (16 March 2002), the rule has been clarified a little by requiring the geocentric conjunction {{of the sun and}} moon to occur before sunset, in addition to requiring moonset to occur after sunset at Mecca. This ensures that the moon has moved past the sun by sunset, even though the sky may still be too bright immediately before moonset to <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> the crescent.|$|E
25|$|Easterly {{believes}} that aid goals should be small. In his opinion, {{one of the}} main failings of aid {{lies in the fact that}} we create large, utopian lists of things we hope to accomplish, without the means to <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> them to fruition. Rather than establish a utopian vision for a particular country, Easterly insists that we shift our focus to the most basic needs and improvements. If we feed, clothe, vaccinate, build infrastructure, and support markets, the macroscopic results will follow.|$|E
25|$|According to {{an article}} {{published}} in American Psychologist in 2007, the original story of Genovese's murder was exaggerated by the media. Specifically, there were not 38 eyewitnesses, the police were contacted at least once during the attack, and many of the bystanders who overheard the attack could not <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> the event. The authors of the article suggest that the story continues to be misrepresented in social psychology textbooks because it functions as a parable and serves as a dramatic example for students.|$|E

25|$|Until then, all {{results from}} the solar radio-spectrographs had been {{inferred}} from studying the Sun by looking at its spectrum with only very limited angular resolution. Wild wanted to <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> what these phenomena looked like on the Sun, actually get a moving picture of them. The frequency range that {{we were interested in}} was around about the metre wavelengths. To get the resolution roughly equivalent to that of the human eye at these long wavelengths required an aperture some three kilometres in diameter. So I devised a method of synthesising a three kilometre aperture with 96 antennas in a ring.|$|E

500|$|Answering {{those who}} {{consider}} Falstaff a [...] "mere sensualist", {{he points out}} how little we <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> Falstaff indulging himself. [...] "All this is as much in imagination as in reality. His sensuality does not engross and stupify his other faculties [...] His imagination keeps up the ball after his senses have done with it. He seems to have even a greater enjoyment of the freedom from restraint, of good cheer, of his ease, of his vanity, in the ideal exaggerated description he gives of them, than in fact." ...|$|E

500|$|Thulium was so {{rare that}} none of the early workers had enough of it to purify {{sufficiently}} to <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> the green color; they had to be content with spectroscopically observing the strengthening of the two characteristic absorption bands, as erbium was progressively removed. [...] The first researcher to obtain nearly pure thulium was Charles James, a British expatriate working on a large scale at New Hampshire College in Durham. In 1911 he reported his results, having used his discovered method of bromate fractional crystallization to do the purification. [...] He famously needed 15,000 purification operations to establish that the material was homogeneous.|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the episode, Phineas and Ferb's time machine is left in positive condition and available for further use at the museum. The writing staff purposely ended it this way so that they could reutilize it later in the series. A concept was eventually conceived as a way to do so, having [...] "Phineas and Ferb go into the future and <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> Candace as an adult (which) drags up all kinds of memories {{of not being able to}} bust them."

500|$|... "Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo" [...] {{was written}} by Scott Peterson and {{directed}} by Zac Moncrief. Phineas and Ferb had previously produced an episode in season one's [...] "It's About Time" [...] which featured a time machine. Co-creator Dan Povenmire stated that he enjoyed the outcome of said episode. The writers purposely left the time machine available for the boys' use {{at the end of}} the episode so that they could reuse it in a later episode. Eventually, they conceived a plot where [...] "Phineas and Ferb go into the future and <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> Candace as an adult (which) drags up all kinds of memories of not being able to bust them." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite {{his early}} optimism, Noades soon {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that a League club in Milton Keynes would not draw crowds much higher than those Wimbledon already attracted in south London. [...] "I couldn't really see us getting any bigger gates than what Northampton Town were currently getting at that time, and, in fact, are still getting," [...] he recalled in 2001. [...] "I really couldn't see any future in it. I can't <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> that there is a means of drawing large attendances to Milton Keynes." [...] Abandoning his interest in MK City, Noades sold Wimbledon to Hammam in 1981 for £40,000. Later that year Noades bought nearby Crystal Palace and briefly explored merging that club with Wimbledon.|$|E

I was brand new here and I wasn’t happy with the way that turned out, and it came back in about 5 or 6 episodes. Every time it came back I was like, ‘Oh, I wish I could have that time over again to redo this one."

Conrad's jealous seneschal interferes and visits Guillaume's family, where he gives his mother a valuable ring and gains her confidence; from her he learns that Liénor has a particular birthmark {{in the shape of a}} rose on her thigh.
