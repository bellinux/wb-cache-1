5|$|In 1979, {{the band}} started {{work on their}} next album, Night in the Ruts. Aerosmith decided to go on tour during {{a break in the}} {{recording}} schedule but tensions within the band were slowly coming to a head. The band's touring schedule brought them to Cleveland Stadium on July 28, 1979, where they headlined the World Series of Rock festival. In a heated argument backstage, Joe Perry's wife, Elissa, threw <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> at Tom Hamilton's wife, Terry. Following the show, Tyler and Perry got into a heated argument when Tyler confronted Perry about his wife's antics, and after the course of the argument Perry quit the band and left (while Tyler claims in his autobiography that he fired Perry from the band). In leaving, Perry took some of the music that he had written with him. Shortly after his departure Perry formed a new band called the Joe Perry Project.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} {{around this time}} in Forth Worth when Short did one of his amazing acts of marksmanship. While dining in a restaurant, the waiter handed him <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> that had a small fly {{treading}} on the surface. Short then calmly threw his milk in the air, jerked his gun and shot the fly.|$|E
25|$|Holy {{books have}} also {{mentioned}} milk. The Bible contains {{references to the}} 'Land of Milk and Honey'. In the Qur'an, there is a request to wonder on milk as follows: 'And surely in the livestock there is a lesson for you, We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies from the midst of digested food and blood, pure milk palatable for the drinkers.'(16-The Honeybee, 66). The Ramadan fast is traditionally broken with <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and dates.|$|E

25|$|Another popular running gag {{concerned}} the social habits of Benny's on-air orchestra, who were consistently {{portrayed as a}} bunch of drunken ne'er-do-wells. Led first by Phil Harris and later by Bob Crosby, the orchestra, and in particular band member Frank Remley, were jokingly portrayed as often being too drunk to play properly, using an overturned bass drum to play cards on just minutes before a show, and so enamored of liquor that the sight of <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> would make them sick. Remley was portrayed in various unflattering situations, such as being thrown into a garbage can by a road sweeper who had found him passed {{out in the street}} at 4am, and on a wanted poster at the Beverly Hills police station.|$|E
25|$|Since his {{childhood}} Haridas Baba had accepted disciplined life as essential in spiritual progress. He became a monk and adopted silence {{as a way}} of seeking inner peace. For health reasons, and to eliminate digestive problems he had with his liver, he chose to drink <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> once or twice a day instead of taking solid food. Since the early days of his association with Neem Karoli he encountered several obstacles in his observance of silence, or eating habits. During one Kumbha Mela, he was obligated by Neem Karoli to break those monastic rules for the reason of following the house rules as having higher but whimsical priority ("What is this rule? For what purpose is it made?").|$|E
25|$|After {{suffering}} from mental disorders for several years, Kiki committed suicide {{on the night}} of December 23, 1946, jumping out of a window of her fifth-floor apartment in the Stanhope Hotel of New York City and landing in a courtyard of the hotel. According to her companion, Lillian Turner, Kiki had been in poor health, depressed and nervous. Turner had just given Preston <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and then went into {{the living room of the}} apartment to read. When she heard no sounds coming from Kiki's bedroom, she entered it, only to find a window open and Kiki gone. Kiki's pajama-clad body was soon discovered in an areaway behind the hotel. Preston's mother, Helen Steele, was also living at the same hotel at the time. Today, Kiki's home on Lake Naivasha is inhabited by the 7th Earl of Enniskillen.|$|E

500|$|With Hoe and Tan as his assistants, Lim {{continued}} his trade, tricking more women into giving him money and sex. [...] By {{the time of}} his arrest, he had 40 [...] "holy wives". [...] In late 1980 he {{was arrested and charged with}} rape. [...] His accuser was Lucy Lau, a door-to-door cosmetic salesgirl, who had met Lim when she was promoting beauty products to Tan. [...] On 19October, Lim told Lau that a ghost was haunting her, but he could exorcise it with his sex rituals. [...] She was unconvinced, but the medium persisted. [...] He secretly mixed two capsules of Dalmadorm, a sedative, into <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and offered it to her, claiming it had holy properties. [...] Lau became groggy after drinking it, which allowed Lim to take advantage of her. [...] For the next few weeks, he continued to abuse her by using drugs or threats. [...] In November, after Lim had given her parents a loan smaller than the amount they had requested, Lau made a police report about his treatment of her. [...] Lim was arrested on charges of rape, and Tan for abetting him. [...] Out on bail, Lim persuaded Hoe to lie that she was present at the alleged rape but saw no crime committed. This failed to stop the police enquiries; Lim and Tan had to extend their bail, in person, at the police station every fortnight.|$|E

2500|$|Another common legend, again {{dating back}} to the 1960s, was that a man who took LSD went insane and {{permanently}} thought that he was a glass of orange juice. Because of this, he could never bend over, slept upright and did not make any sudden movements. [...] Alternative versions sometimes have the man thinking he is <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> or a whole orange. Another version of this myth states that the man believed he had become an orange, and was afraid he would be 'peeled' by his friends.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, English band The Smiths {{released}} {{their third}} single, [...] "What Difference Does It Make?". The single cover was a photograph {{taken on the}} set of the film The Collector (but not depicted in the actual film). Originally, Stamp refused permission for the still to be used, and some pressings featured lead singer Morrissey in a re-enacted scene. In the re-enactment Morrissey is holding <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> as opposed to a chloroform pad in the original. Eventually, however, Stamp changed his mind, and the original cover was reinstated.|$|E

2500|$|Both the fat {{globules}} and {{the smaller}} casein micelles, which are just large enough to deflect light, contribute to the opaque white color of milk. The fat globules contain some yellow-orange carotene, enough in some breeds (such as Guernsey and Jersey cattle) to impart a golden or [...] "creamy" [...] hue to <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> The riboflavin in the whey portion of milk has a greenish color, which sometimes can be discerned in skimmed milk or whey products. Fat-free skimmed milk has only the casein micelles to scatter light, {{and they tend to}} scatter shorter-wavelength blue light more than they do red, giving skimmed milk a bluish tint.|$|E
2500|$|Gunatitanand Swami {{was born}} on 17 October 1785 (Aso Sud Punam, Vikram Samvat 1841) to Bholanath and Sakarba Jani {{in the village of}} Bhadra, {{situated}} near the river Und in what is now Gujarat, India. His father’s guru, Ramanand Swami, named him Mulji. Even from a young age, it was evident that Mulji had a “disinclination towards material objects” and would exhibit a perspicacity that was rare for a child of his age, often claiming while playing with his younger brother Sundarji that he would become a sadhu and inspire Sundarji to become one. Various accounts indicate a close association between Mulji and Swaminarayan, who was born four years before Mulji. One such incident details how a thin line of milk appeared on the lips of a murti of “Thakorji,” a small metal idol of Swaminarayan, while Mulji was himself drinking <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk.</b> In response to his mother’s surprise at this, Mulji had explained, “Mother! Thakorji is always present in my heart. When I eat, Thakorji eats with me.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Mihai Eminescu died at 4am, on 15 June 1889 at the Caritas Institute, a {{sanatorium}} run by Dr. Suțu {{and located}} on Plantelor Street Sector 2, Bucharest. Eminescu's last wish was <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> which the attending doctor {{slipped through the}} metallic peephole of the [...] "cell" [...] where he spent the last hours of his life. In response to this favor he {{was said to have}} whispered, [...] "I'm crumbled". The next day, on 16 June 1889 he was officially declared deceased and legal papers to that effect were prepared by doctors Suțu and Petrescu, who submitted the official report. This paperwork is seen as being ambiguous, because the poet's cause of death is not clearly stated and there was no indication of any other underlying condition that may have so suddenly resulted in his death. In fact both the poet's medical file and autopsy report indicate symptoms of a mental and not physical disorder. Moreover, at the autopsy performed by Dr. Tomescu and then by Dr. Marinescu from the laboratory at Babeș-Bolyai University, the brain could not be studied, because a nurse inadvertently forgot it on an open window, where it quickly decomposed.|$|E
5000|$|The submarino (meaning [...] "submarine" [...] in Spanish) or remo (meaning [...] "oar") is a {{beverage}} traditionally {{drunk in}} Argentina and Uruguay.

2500|$|Non-dairy milks {{that are}} {{fortified}} with calcium, such as soymilk and almond milk can also contribute {{a significant amount}} of calcium in the diet. [...] The calcium found in broccoli, bok choy, and kale have also been found to have calcium that is well absorbed in the body. [...] Though the calcium content per serving is lower in these vegetables than <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> the absorption of the calcium into the body is higher. [...] Other [...] foods that contain calcium include calcium-set tofu, blackstrap molasses, turnip greens, mustard greens, soybeans, tempeh, almonds, okra, dried figs, and tahini. Though calcium can be found in Spinach, swiss chard, beans and beet greens, they are generally not considered to be a good source since the calcium binds to oxalic acid and is poorly absorbed into the body. [...] Phytic acid found in nuts, seeds, and beans may also impact calcium absorption rates. [...] See the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements for calcium needs for various ages, the Vegetarian Resource Group and the Vegetarian Nutrition Calcium Fact Sheet from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics [...] for more specifics on how to obtain adequate calcium intake on a vegetarian or vegan diet.|$|E
2500|$|Arne De Boever {{believes}} {{that there is a}} [...] "close affinity, and intimacy even, between the sheriff and Chigurh in No Country for Old Men [...] in a number of scenes. There is, to begin with, the sheriff's voice {{at the beginning of the}} film, which accompanies the images of Chigurh's arrest. This initial weaving together of the figures of Chigurh and the sheriff is further developed later on in the film, when the sheriff visits Llewelyn Moss' trailer home in search for Moss and his wife, Carla Jean. Chigurh has visited the trailer only minutes before, and the Coen brothers have the sheriff sit down in the same exact spot where Chigurh had been sitting (which is almost the exact same spot where, the evening before, Moss joined his wife on the couch). Like Chigurh, the sheriff sees himself reflected in the dark glass of Moss' television, their mirror images perfectly overlapping if one were to superimpose these two shots. When the sheriff pours himself <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> from the bottle that stands sweating on the living room table—a sign that the sheriff and his colleague, deputy Wendell (Garret Dillahunt), only just missed their man—this mirroring of images goes beyond the level of reflection, and Chigurh enters into the sheriff's constitution, thus further undermining any easy opposition of Chigurh and the sheriff, and instead exposing a certain affinity, intimacy, or similarity even between both." ...|$|E
