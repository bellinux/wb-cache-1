Mayor Marion Barry, met Barry <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Park <b>Hyatt</b> on December 22, 1988, and smoked crack cocaine there with Barry and Barry friend Willie Davis. On June 23, 1990, Barry {{stood in front}} of <b>the</b> Park <b>Hyatt</b> and denounced Crenshaw and others who testified to his illegal drug use as [...] "liars". Barry's later conviction on federal felony drug use charges significantly damaged his political career, and on September 11, 1990, corporate executive Sharon Pratt Dixon defeated Barry in the D.C. Democratic primary. Dixon held her primary night victory party <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Park <b>Hyatt.</b> Barry attempted to win re-election as a write-in candidate. His effort proved unsuccessful. On November 6, 1990, Sharon Pratt Dixon held her election night party <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Park <b>Hyatt,</b> while in nearby, near-empty ballroom Marion Barry conceded defeat.|$|R

Johnson was arrested <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hyatt</b> Regency Tech Center, at about 4:30 a.m. Adolf was arrested at the Cherry Creek Hotel in Glendale at about 5 a.m. Adolf jumped out of a sixth-story hotel window when police arrived. He fell four stories onto the second-floor roof of the hotel kitchen, then jumped again onto the ground around the hotel. He broke his ankle in the fall, but tried to run before police found him a short {{distance}} away. Adolf, who was hospitalized shortly after his arrest, was wearing body armor when police apprehended him. He told police this was because [...] "someone wanted to shoot him". Like Gartrell, Johnson and Adolf {{were found to be}} under the influence of methamphetamine during their arrests.

500|$|In August 2008 [...] Tharin Robert Gartrell, 28, {{his cousin}} Shawn Robert Adolf, 33, and their friend Nathan Dwaine Johnson, 32, {{allegedly}} came to Denver, Colorado, specifically to kill then-Senator Barack Obama at the Democratic National Convention. The men came to Denver before Obama arrived there, and rented a room <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hyatt</b> Regency Tech Center, where they mistakenly believed Obama was staying (in fact, Obama {{was staying at}} another Denver hotel). Federal authorities began {{an investigation into the}} trio after they made alleged racist threats against Obama while taking methamphetamine in the hotel room. A woman present for their conversation, who was not identified by a police affidavit, told Colorado State Patrol officers they [...] "could not believe how close he was to becoming President". She claimed they spoke about killing the presumed Democratic presidential nominee, and that Adolf allegedly said, [...] "No nigger should ever live in the White House." [...] A woman in the group said it would be a [...] "suicide mission", and it would be best done by hiding a gun inside a hollowed-out television video camera, a method used in the 1992 Kevin Costner film, The Bodyguard. Security had already been increased for Obama due to low-grade fears of possible assassination attempts against the first African American major party presidential candidate. Authorities did not identify the woman who informed on the trio, nor did they disclose whether she was charged with a crime.|$|E
500|$|Bryant {{became the}} butt of jokes on {{television}} shows and film, even by former colleague Bob Hope. Everywhere she went {{in the days after}} the vote she was met with noisy protests: Norfolk, Virginia—where demonstrators interrupted her presentation so forcefully she began crying—Chicago, and dozens of other cities. The Ku Klux Klan appeared at one of Bryant's appearances in Huntington, West Virginia claiming they were there to protect her. She attracted the largest gay demonstration in Canadian history when she appeared at a Toronto religious performance. Though she performed and spoke only at revivals and other religious shows, audiences were often less than half the expected number, and many would leave when she came on stage. In Houston Bryant was invited to perform for the Texas State Bar Association two weeks after the Dade County vote. With no cohesive political community, a few gay organizers invited people to protest her appearance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hyatt</b> Regency. An organizer estimated for police that 500people might participate, but guessed because no gay community had responded to a cause before; police prepared for that number. However, thousands of people swarmed around the hotel chanting loudly enough to drown Bryant's performance; a conservative estimate of the participants' numbers was 2,000. The audience inside could not hear Bryant, and at one point attorneys working with the American Civil Liberties Union walked out and joined the protesters. One of the organizers said that he had never seen so many gay people in one place before, and then made a speech thanking Bryant: [...] "If God in his infinite wisdom had not created Anita Bryant, we would have had to invent her". He claimed the protest had the same result in Houston as the Stonewall riots.|$|E

TNA originally planned to use former professional football player and professional wrestler Steve McMichael as a Special Ringside Enforcer before management changed their minds and decided to use Mick Foley in the role instead. TNA later issued a press release announcing that McMichael would take part in the Bound for Glory IV festivities as a Special Guest Referee due to his fame and connection to the Chicago Bears and Chicago in general.|$|E

[...] After {{five days of}} silence, talks began again on August 14 under the personal supervision of Labor Secretary Herman <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hyatt</b> Regency Washington hotel {{across the street from}} the Teamsters' headquarters. After two days of nearly continuous bargaining, UPS withdrew its pension demand. President Clinton personally spoke to both parties over the weekend to encourage them to continue bargaining, and a final tentative contract emerged on Monday afternoon, August 18. The pact included several major concessions by the employer: [...] Starting pay of part-time workers would increase for the first time since 1982, 10,000 part-time jobs would be converted into full-time jobs, UPS would stay in the union's multi-employer pension plan, most workers would see significant benefit increases, and five-sixths of all new full-time jobs would be filled by existing part-timers. The union agreed to a five-year contract rather than the proposed four-year deal. The company had lost more than $600 million in business during the strike, and fears of even larger losses had finally led it to concede. The 50-person Teamsters bargaining committee and conference of 200 UPS locals ratified the agreement on August 19.|$|E
