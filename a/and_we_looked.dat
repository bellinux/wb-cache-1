500|$|.....We felt {{because it}} was 20 years earlier, these are much younger Spartans. They aren't quite as {{experienced}} as Master Chief, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> a lot at combat infantry going into actual wars, and typically {{at the beginning of}} a war, especially the Vietnam War, if you look at the infantry, they're all loaded up. They have all the backpacks on, they have all the belts on, every single bit of armor is there, and they're carrying around lots of armor. At the end of the war, they've lost it all and just carry what they need. This is all they have. So if you look at our Spartans, they have more pieces of armor on going into the war. They have more markings on there, more pieces of armor. They've still got the belts on, they're still carrying around everything.|$|E

This story provoked reactions ranging from [...] "fantastic and fascinating" [...] by gay author Jeremy Hooper at the Good As You blog to negative comments from gay author David Ehrenstein, who noted the show was [...] "replete with the sort of clichés about gay men and effeminacy that haven’t been seen in a network news context since the 1967 CBS broadcast [...]" [...] Shari Finkelstein, the producer of the [...] "Gay or Straight" [...] segment, responded: [...] "We were aware of the controversy surrounding Michael Bailey's book, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> into all the allegations before we decided to interview him for the story...." [...] She concluded: [...] "We didn't feel there was anything that disqualified him from being interviewed. And in fact, his work is highly regarded by all of the researchers in the field who we spoke with, and we felt that he was a very worthy person to discuss these issues." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 15, 1995, defense {{attorney}} Johnnie Cochran goaded assistant prosecutor Christopher Darden into asking Simpson {{to put on}} the leather glove that was found {{at the scene of the}} crime. The prosecution had earlier decided against asking Simpson to try on the gloves because (according to prosecutors) the glove had been soaked in blood from Simpson, Brown and Goldman, and frozen and unfrozen several times. The leather glove seemed too tight for Simpson to put on easily, especially over the sanitary gloves he wore underneath. Uelmen came up with and Cochran repeated a quip he had used several times in relation to other points in his closing arguments, [...] "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit". On June 22, 1995, Darden told Judge Lance Ito of his concerns that Simpson [...] "has arthritis <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> at the medication he takes and some of it is anti-inflammatory and we are told he has not taken the stuff for a day and it caused swelling in the joints and inflammation in his hands". The prosecution also stated their belief that the glove shrank from having been soaked in blood and later testing. The prosecution presented a photo during the trial of Simpson earlier wearing the same type of glove that was found at the crime scene.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the early}} years of the state of Israel the village was {{subjected}} to repeated searches by the army and anyone who had not registered as resident in November 1948 could be expelled. One case attracted a lot of public criticism. In June 1950, the IDF and police rounded up 105 men and women believed to be infiltrators were deported to Jordan. In an open letter to the Knesset, the inhabitants of Abu Ghosh claimed that the army had [...] "surrounded our village, and taken our women, children and old folk, and thrown them over the border and into the Negev Desert, and many of them died in consequence, when they were shot [...] the borders." [...] The letter further stated that they woke up to [...] "shouts blaring over the loudspeaker announcing that the village was surrounded and anyone trying to get out would be shot....The police and military forces then began to enter the houses and conduct meticulous searches, but no contraband was found. In the end, using force and blows, they gathered up our women, and old folk and children, the sick and the blind and pregnant women. These shouted for help but there was no saviour. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> on and were powerless to do anything save beg for mercy. Alas, our pleas were of no avail... They then took the prisoners, who were weeping and screaming, to an unknown place, and we still do not know what befell them." ...|$|E
