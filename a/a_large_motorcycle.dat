50|$|The Royal Star Venture is <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>motorcycle.</b> Rider {{seat height}} is 29.5 in.

40|$|Single-track {{vehicles}} are multibody systems which include bicycles, motorcycles and motor scooters. The Whipple's model of bicycle {{consists of two}} frames, the rear frame and the front frame, which are hinged together along an inclined steering-head assembly. The nonslipping road wheels as with this model are modeled by holonomic constraints in the normal direction and by nonholonomic constraints in the longitudinal and lateral directions. The bicycle model has three degrees of freedom such as the roll angle of the rear frame, the steering angle and the angle of rotation of the rear wheel to the rear frame. Motorcycles differ from bicycles {{in such a way}} that <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>motorcycle</b> can weigh at least ten times as much as a bicycle. Essential components of high-fidelity cornering models include a rigid rear frame, a front frame joined to the rear frame using an inclined steering system, spinning road wheels, an elaborate tire force and moment representation, lag mechanisms, aerodynamic effects, a realistic suspension model and the freedom for the rider's upper body to roll relative to the rear frame of the vehicle. Considerable insight into the stability and steering control of single-track vehicles within the model applicability boundaries can be gained from their separable design parameter influences...|$|E
50|$|Four events between 1913 and 1920, led to {{the closing}} of the park. A flood in 1913 damaged many of the Lagoon's attractions. <b>A</b> <b>large</b> {{financial}} investment was necessary to restore the facilities. In that same year, tragedy struck the park.

However, in July 1913, a serious wreck brought notoriety to the lagoon. A driver lost control of his motorcycle and veered off into the stands. The cycle hit a gas lamp causing fire to spread throughout the grandstand. Panic set in as the 5,000 spectators tried to flee the fire. The result was horrific. Nine people were killed and over a hundred were treated for burns.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to classified ads for motorcycles, parts, accessories and related services, the magazine also featured columns written by Buzz Walneck (who remained as the magazine's editor until 2012), {{as well as}} a number of other writers. It also included reprints of classic motorcycle tests and reviews, typically from Cycle World, as well as listings for <b>large</b> national <b>motorcycle</b> auctions and Buzz Walneck's swap meets. In the early 1990s, Walneck was responsible for tracking down Roadog, <b>a</b> <b>large,</b> custom-built <b>motorcycle</b> that was the subject of popular posters, and purchasing one of two existing examples; the magazine subsequently contained many articles about his search for the bike. Buzz Walneck frequently appears at motorcycle events and auctions, and is an adviser to Sotheby's regarding vintage motorcycles. Walneck's ceased publishing in 2014, however other magazines have followed a similar format, including Moto Retro Illustrated. In 2014, Walneck resumed publishing his own magazine called The Buzzzzz Rag using the original Walneck's format.|$|R
