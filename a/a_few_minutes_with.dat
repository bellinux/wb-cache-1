5|$|Characters can {{continue}} to level up through activities within the Peristylium while the PSP is in sleep mode, the game's UMD is running, and the PSP is charging. The multiplayer function, activated through the game's configuration screen, allows two other players to jump into another host player's game via an online connection. The allotted time for multiplayer is limited to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>with</b> transitions between zones triggering {{the end of a}} multiplayer section. The time limit can be extended by players helping their current host. The first and last segments of the game are not open to multiplayer. There is also a function called Magical Academy Assist, in which NPCs named after members of the game's production team are summoned into battle to assist the cadets.|$|E
5|$|Pickingill {{was also}} known for his purported ability to control animals, namely horses, and it was {{believed}} that when he struck a hedgerow with his stick, game animals would run out that could then be caught, killed and eaten. It was also rumoured that he could do things faster than ordinary human beings, and that he could do an hour's job in only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>with</b> some believing that he got his imps—his familiar spirits—to do the job for him. Maple also noted that people who visited his cottage reported seeing ornaments and furniture dancing around the room of their own accord; the folklorist believed that this story had originated in a Dutch folkloric tradition that may have been imported to Essex when many Dutch migrants settled there in the seventeenth century.|$|E

Rooney retired from 60 Minutes, delivering his final commentary on October 2, 2011; it was his 1,097th commentary over his 34-year career on the program. He died one month later, on November 4, 2011. The November 13, 2011, edition of 60 Minutes featured an hour-long tribute to Rooney and his career, and included a rebroadcast of his final commentary segment.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Arden {{investigates the}} death chute {{to find the}} empty cart Grace was taken from and inhuman {{footprints}} leading out of the tunnel. He later shows Kit a plaster cast of the footprint, believing it to be alien. He asks Kit if {{he had sex with}} wife Alma (Britne Oldford) and Grace (Lizzie Brocheré) before their abductions, thinking the aliens are experimenting with eugenics. Arden asks Kit's permission to cause his temporary death to see if the aliens return. Kit consents, believing it will allow him to see Alma again. Arden renders Kit dead by a potassium chloride injection, promising to revive him in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>with</b> atropine and epinephrine. Bright light and loud sounds fill the hallways, and Arden leaves Kit to find Pepper (Naomi Grossman) and a naked full-term pregnant Grace.|$|E

25|$|The semi-final {{match was}} against Argentina. The game was never close. The USA team held Argentina to 8 {{points in the}} first and second periods, while scoring 30 and 26 respectively. While Argentina out scored the USA in the third quarter, the game was largely decided by that point. The USA {{finished}} with a win, 97–51, to advance to the gold medal game. The gold medal game was a re-match with Canada. Although Canada scored first and stayed close for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>with</b> a score at 10–8 halfway through the first period, the USA went on a 12–0 run to take command. Canada got the margin back to eleven at one point, but the USA team extended the lead to 18 points by halftime. The USA won the game and the gold medal by a score of 104–75. A'ja Wilson was the leading scorer with 25 points, and led all rebounders with 11.|$|E
25|$|In January 1981, the {{government}} returned Tutu's passport to him. In March, he {{embarked on a}} five-week visit to ten countries in Europe and North America, meeting politicians including the UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim, and addressing the UN Special Committee Against Apartheid. In the UK he met Runcie and in Rome spent <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>with</b> Pope John Paul II. On his return to South Africa, Botha again ordered his passport confiscated. In August 1983, South Africans opposed to apartheid formed the United Democratic Front (UDF), with Tutu selected {{as one of the}} organisation's patrons. His rhetoric of angry defiance against {{the government}} alienated many white liberals, who believed that apartheid could be gradually reformed away; among the white liberals who spoke out against Tutu were Alan Paton and Bill Burnett. He nevertheless remained close with other prominent white liberals like Helen Suzman. He was also criticised in pro-government press outlets like The Citizen and the South African Broadcasting Corporation, while receiving death threats from white far-right groups like the Wit Wolwe and Wit Kommando.|$|E
500|$|By 1937 {{interest}} in Davidson's Blackpool sideshows was waning and, for that summer, he accepted {{an invitation to}} join the self-styled [...] "Captain" [...] Fred Rye's animal-themed show in the east coast resort of Skegness. He considered this a step upwards from what he termed [...] "the blatant vulgarities of Blackpool". Davidson's act consisted of a 10-minute address delivered outside a cage containing two lions, after which he would enter the cage and spend <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>with</b> the lions. This required courage on Davidson's part, because he was fearful of animals. A 16-year-old tamer, Irene Somner, supervised proceedings. The act was billed as [...] "Daniel in a modern lion's den", and attracted large audiences, including {{a significant number of}} clergy.|$|E

500|$|The male {{bog turtle}} is {{territorial}} and will attack other males if they venture within [...] of his position. An aggressive male will crawl toward an intruder with his neck extended. As he approaches his foe, he tilts his carapace by withdrawing {{his head and}} raising his hind limbs. If the other male does not retreat, a fight of pushing and biting can follow. The bouts typically last just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>with</b> the larger and older male usually winning. The female is also aggressive when threatened. She will defend the area around her nest, usually up to a radius of , from encroaching females, but when a juvenile approaches, she ignores it, and when a male appears she surrenders her area (except during mating season).|$|E
500|$|Lennon was {{pronounced}} dead on arrival {{in the emergency room}} at the Roosevelt Hospital at 11:15 pm by Dr. Lynn, but the time of 11:07 pm has also been reported. Lennon's body was then taken to the city morgue at 520 First Avenue and autopsied. The cause of death was reported on his death certificate as [...] "hypovolemic shock, caused by the loss of more than 80% of blood volume due to multiple through-and-through gunshot wounds to the left shoulder and left chest resulting in damage to the left lung and left subclavian artery and aortic arch". The pathologist who performed the autopsy on Lennon also stated in his report that even with prompt medical treatment, no person could have lived for more than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>with</b> such multiple bullet injuries to all of the major arteries and veins around the heart.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the first}} day, Cowan pulled the tanks {{out of the}} town during the night, {{although}} he left patrols to defend the area already captured. The next day, 1 March, Cowan had the Corps commander (Lieutenant General Frank Messervy) and General Slim watching anxiously {{over his shoulder at}} his headquarters, both worried that the Japanese might hold out for weeks. In the event, in spite of desperate resistance, the town fell in less than four days. Although the Japanese had plenty of artillery, they were unable to concentrate their fire sufficiently to stop any single attacking brigade. Lack of anti-tank weapons gravely handicapped the defenders. Slim later described watching two platoons from 1/7th Gurkha Rifles supported by a single M4 Sherman tank overrun several Japanese bunkers and eliminate their defenders in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>with</b> only a few casualties to themselves. In an attempt to improvise anti-tank defences, some Japanese soldiers crouched in trenches, clutching [...] aircraft bombs, with orders to strike the detonator when an enemy tank loomed over the trench. Most were shot by an officer of 255 Brigade and Indian soldiers.|$|E

2500|$|It seems {{then that}} scuffles between the Sikhs and Tibetan guards grouped around Tibetan generals sparked an {{action of the}} Lhasa general: he fired a pistol hitting a Sikh in the jaw. British {{accounts}} insist that the Tibetan general became angry {{at the sight of}} the brawl developing and shot the Sikh soldier in the face, prompting a violent response from the soldier's comrades, which rapidly escalated the situation. Henry Newman, a reporter for Reuters, who described himself as an eye-witness, said that following this shot, the mass of Tibetans surged forward and their attack fell next on a correspondent for the Daily Mail, Edmund Candler, and that very soon after this, fire was directed from three sides on the Tibetans crowded behind the wall. In Doctor Austine Waddell's account, [...] "they poured a withering fire into the enemy, which, with the quick firing Maxims, mowed down the Tibetans in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>with</b> a terrific slaughter." [...] Second-hand accounts from the Tibetan side have asserted both that the British tricked the Tibetans into extinguishing the fuses for their matchlocks, and that the British opened fire without warning. However, no evidence exists to show such trickery took place and the likelihood is that the unwieldy weapons were of very limited use in the circumstances. Furthermore, the British, Sikh, and Gurkha soldiers closest to the Tibetans were nearly all protected by a high wall, and none were killed.|$|E
