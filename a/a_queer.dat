The novel features Asian-Canadian characters in these lesbian relationships, incorporating racial and ethnic identity into <b>a</b> <b>queer</b> understanding of speculative fiction. Salt Fish Girl engages queer ideas in regards to procreation and bodies, as characters are able to give birth without sperm by eating the durian fruit. It was shortlisted for the James Tiptree Jr. award in 2002.|$|E

25|$|Queer {{theory is}} a field of post-structuralist {{critical}} theory {{that emerged in the}} early 1990s out of the fields of queer studies and women's studies. Applications of queer theory include queer theology and queer pedagogy. Queer theorists, including Rod Ferguson, Jasbir Puar, Lisa Duggan, and Chong-suk Han, critique the mainstream gay political movement as allied with neoliberal and imperialistic agendas, including gay tourism, gay and trans military inclusion, and state- and church-sanctioned marriages for monogamous gay couples. Puar, <b>a</b> <b>queer</b> theorist of color, coined the term homonationalism, which refers to the rise of American exceptionalism, nationalism, white supremacy, and patriarchy within the gay community catalyzed in response to the September 11 attacks. Many studies have acknowledged the problems that lie within the traditional theory and process of social studies, and so choose to utilise <b>a</b> <b>queer</b> theoretical approach instead. One such study was conducted in Melbourne in 2016 by Roffee and Waling. By using queer and feminist theories and approaches the researchers were better equipped to cater for the needs, and be accommodating for the vulnerabilities, of the LGBTIQ participants of the study. In this case, it was a specifically post-modern queer theory that enabled the researchers to approach the study with a fair perspective, acknowledging all the varieties of narratives and experiences within the LGBTIQ community.|$|E

40|$|This article {{draws on}} queer theory to advance a {{research}} agenda that foregrounds lesbian, gay, bi and trans (LGBT) perspectives and issues as one {{means by which}} business schools can be made queer(er) institutions to work. As such, this article employs <b>a</b> process of <b>queering</b> to expose how LGBT people experience and negotiate the heteronormativity within business schools. <b>A</b> <b>queering</b> approach is encouraged to generate research on LGBT sexualities that can reveal instances of queerness within business schools, {{with the aim of}} helping LGBT people and their allies to foster alternative ways of relating, identifying and organizing that transcend heteronormativity. As such, the research agenda elaborates on the importance of the following: problematizing organizational heteronormativity; queering organizational and management knowledge; and the role of straight and queer allies. This article concludes by speculating about the implications of <b>a</b> <b>queer(er)</b> business school for LGBT people and their allies...|$|R

500|$|Since {{so little}} {{information}} was available about lesbians and lesbianism at the time, Bannon's books, through their far-reaching distribution and popularity served {{to form a}} part of a lesbian identity not only for the heterosexual population at large, but lesbians themselves. Lesbian author and historian Joan Nestle called the books [...] "survival literature", explaining: [...] "In whatever towns or cities these books were read, they were spreading the information that meant a new hope for trapped and isolated women". One retrospective writer noted, [...] "ntil the late 1960s, when the sexual revolution was emerging, the pulps provided a cultural space that helped to forge <b>a</b> <b>queer</b> identity".|$|E

The publication's Cecilia D'Anastasio pointed to a previous statement from Blizzard, where the developers clarified their intention to have an LGBT character reveal play out organically, [...] commenting: [...] "I feel that the comic did that. Tracer buys her partner a scarf. Her partner likes it. They kiss. The comic moves on. I think it was handled quite well, {{although the idea of}} Blizzard announcing <b>a</b> <b>queer</b> character feels sort of.... gimmicky." [...] Gita Jackson concurred with D'Anastasio stating she [...] "was definitely concerned that revealing <b>a</b> <b>queer</b> character would come off as a gimmick, and [...] very pleased at how they pulled this off. This doesn't feel tokenized." [...] Fellow Kotaku writer Heather Alexandra commented, [...] "I think having something explicit was necessary [...] Having something definite gives queer players a proper point of contact." [...] Andy Chalk of PC Gamer noted that: ...the comic itself is a fairly straightforward heartwarming tale of what really matters during the most hectic season of all. But the reaction to Tracer's identity has been anything but.
