50|$|By 1925 the {{vertical}} <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> {{had been taken}} advantage of to improve steam porting and access for maintenance. The Super-Sentinel engine used two camshafts: inlet and exhaust, placed near the crankshaft in the crankcase and operating the poppet valves through long pushrods. In the original waggon engine, all four valves were mounted {{at the far end}} of the cylinder from the crankshaft, requiring long narrow ports to the other end of the cylinder. With the locomotives the easily accessed vertical engine allowed a pair of these valves to be moved to the lower end of the cylinder, allowing for a short, efficient port with less 'dead space'. The crankcase of the engine, together with the crosshead trunk guide, was enclosed and provided with oil splash lubrication. A small plenum was left exposed between the cylinder's piston rod stuffing box and another gland seal into the crankcase. This allowed any steam that did leak past the seals to be vented to the atmosphere, rather than condensing within the crankcase.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a one-dimensional internal combustion engine simulation program for the Pivotal two-stroke engine. The Pivotal two-stroke engine has many features in common with the standard reciprocating piston engine, but differs in its novel kinematics, which are based around a four bar linkage. The new engine arrangement opens up many new design options and required a flexible and specific simulation tool for research and development. The initial project goals were to develop a simulation code, validate the code against engine data and develop a user interface for easier application. However, {{it was not possible to}} realise all of these goals and the project was mostly concerned with the development of the simulation numerical code. Validation will be required before the simulation tool can be used with confidence. Engine simulation is a relatively mature field of research and the simulation program includes many established standard methods. The simulation incorporates a standard single zone thermodynamic cylinder model and a Riemann quasi-one-dimensional finite volume gas dynamics scheme, which includes total variation diminishing variable extrapolation. The calculation of flow through valves uses standard equations for orifice flow and the application to pipe boundary conditions utilises the propagation of characteristic information out of the pipe boundary. Simulation of reed valve deflection has been implemented with the finite element method using direct integration in time. The entire code has been implemented in the Fortran programming language using Compaq Visual Fortran 6. 5. To establish a flexible simulation the program has been devised so that the input text data file determines the <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> allowing most engine configurations to be modelled with the one simulation tool. Summary data, including engine power, is outputted to a text file, which can be read by any text editor. Detailed simulation results are written to Matlab mat-files, which require Matlab 5. 3, or greater, to open and analyze. In its current form the simulation code is capable of running arbitrary engine arrangements, including the Pivotal engine, and can predict the performance of these engines. However, the code is un-validated against real engine data. Where possible sub-models have been tested and proven against special test cases that have an analytic solution. The next logical extension beyond the current project is to thoroughly validate and compare the engine simulation against real engine test data. Other areas in which the code could be improved include; extending the simulation code to incorporate more advanced models and improving the ease with which engine simulations can be set-up, run and analysed...|$|E

50|$|To keep {{development}} costs down, as many components as possible were adopted from the single-engine PC-6 Porter, {{such as the}} center fuselage, the wings and main landing gear.

A tandem <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> like on <b>the</b> Dornier Wal above the fuselage, as with the earlier flying boats, was considered.

5000|$|The Mark IV {{differed}} from <b>the</b> W-series <b>engine</b> was in <b>the</b> placement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valves and <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> combustion chambers.

The valves continued to use <b>the</b> displaced <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> W-series <b>engine,</b> but were also inclined {{so that they would}} open away from the combustion chamber and cylinder walls, a design feature made possible by Chevrolet's stud mounted rocker arms.

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} for NASA Glenn Research Center under contract NNC 10 BA 05 B, Task NNC 11 TA 80 T to identify beneficial <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turboshaft <b>engine,</b> transmissions and related systems within the propulsion pod nacelle of NASA's Large Civil Tilt-Rotor 2 nd iteration (LCTR 2) vehicle. Propulsion pod layouts were used to investigate potential advantages, disadvantages, as well as constraints <b>of</b> various <b>arrangements</b> assuming front or aft shafted engines. Results from previous NASA LCTR 2 propulsion system studies and tasks performed by Boeing under NASA contracts are {{used as the basis}} for this study. This configuration consists of two Fixed Geometry Variable Speed Power Turbine Engines and related drive and rotor systems (per nacelle) arranged in tilting nacelles near the wing tip. Entry-into-service (EIS) 2035 technology is assumed for both <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and drive systems. The variable speed rotor system changes from 100 percent speed for hover to 54 percent speed for cruise by <b>the</b> means <b>of</b> a two speed gearbox concept developed under previous NASA contracts. Propulsion and drive system configurations that resulted in minimum vehicle gross weight were identified in previous work and used here. Results reported in this study illustrate that a forward shafted engine has a slight weight benefit over an aft shafted <b>engine</b> for <b>the</b> LCTR 2 vehicle. Although <b>the</b> aft shafted <b>engines</b> provide a more controlled and centered CG (between hover and cruise), <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long rotor shaft and complicated engine exhaust arrangement outweighed the potential benefits. A Multi-Disciplinary Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) approach for transmission sizing was also explored for this study. This tool offers quick analysis of gear loads, bearing lives, efficiencies, etc., through use of commercially available RomaxDESIGNER software. The goal was to create quick methods to explore various concept models. The output results from RomaxDESIGNER have been successfully linked to Boeing spreadsheets that generate gear tooth geometry in Catia 3 D environment. Another initial goal was to link information from RomaxDESIGNER (such as hp, rpm, gear ratio) to populate Boeing's parametric weight spreadsheet and create an automated method to estimate drive system weight. This was only partially achieved due to <b>the</b> variety <b>of</b> weight models, number of manual inputs, and qualitative assessments required. A simplified weight spreadsheet was used with data inputs from RomaxDESIGNER along with manual inputs to perform rough weight calculations...|$|R
