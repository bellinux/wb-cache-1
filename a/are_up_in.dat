2500|$|While the {{introduction}} of steroids certainly increased the power production of greats there were other factors that drastically increased the power surge after 1994. The factors cited are: smaller sized ballparks than in the past, the [...] "juiced balls" [...] theory claiming that the balls are wound tighter thus travel further following contact with the bat, [...] "watered down pitching" [...] implying that lesser quality pitchers <b>are</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the Major Leagues due to too many teams. Albeit that these factors did play {{a large role in}} increasing home run thus scoring totals during this time, others that directly impact ballplayers have an equally important role. As noted earlier one of those factors is anabolic steroids which have the capability of increasing muscle mass, which enables hitters to not only hit [...] "mistake" [...] pitches farther, but it also enables hitters to adjust to [...] "good" [...] pitches such as a well-placed fastball, slider, changeup, or curveball, and hit them for home runs. Another such factor is better nutrition, as well as training and training facilities/equipment which can work with (or without) steroids to produce a more potent ballplayer and further enhance his skills.|$|E
