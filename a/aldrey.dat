It was also announced that the old building would be preserved as a cultural centre, alongside a new shopping mall: Paseo <b>Aldrey,</b> named after Florencio <b>Aldrey</b> Iglesias, a multimedia and which was inaugurated November 28, 2015.|$|E

50|$|Greasy Grapes has {{released}} three albums {{in a totally}} independent fashion Lengua Madre EP (2013), Headed South (2012) and At the Back of the Hill (2009). All three album are deeply rooted in a vintage vibe and an eclectic blend of rock, soul, blues and country sounds. They have worked with Grammy Awarded and Grammy nominee artists like Bob Katz, Erik <b>Aldrey</b> and Mauricio Arcas a.k.a. Maurimix from Los Amigos Invisibles.|$|E
50|$|Further, one cannot build pylons {{arbitrarily}} high {{at either}} end of the crossing section, and there is a usually a considerable minimum height because of ships crossing under the line, so there is often a high mechanical tension in the conductors at long spans. This tension requires conductors made largely of steel, which have a worse electrical conductivity than the common overhead line conductors consisting of copper, <b>Aldrey</b> or aluminum-encased steel, and also limits the amount of transmittable electrical power. For this reason, for crossings with a span width of more than approximately 2 km, those in charge of construction should consider laying an underwater cable as the more practicable solution.|$|E
50|$|A unique {{aspect of}} this line is the 75-metre-high anchor pylon, which stands on 28-metre-high feet of {{concrete}} in the artificial lake of Santa Maria, canton Graubünden. This pylon was built in 1949 as a normal pylon. At {{the construction of the}} Santa María Dam it was replaced in 1957 by the existing pylon on concrete feet to protect the steel construction from the water and at wintertime from ice on the lake. This pylon carries one crossarm for one circuit.The mean span width of the line is 350 m, the biggest span width between two pylons is 890 m. As conductors bundles of two and three conductors of <b>Aldrey</b> (a aluminium-magnesium-silicon alloy) with a cross section of 550 mm2 are used. The diameter of each single conductor is 30.5 mm. As ground wire two steel ropes with a cross section of 80 mm2 are used.|$|E

The algorithm of graph-analytical engineering method of corrosion current calculation in multielectrode system including {{the principles of}} graphic and analytical {{calculation methods}} is presented.
