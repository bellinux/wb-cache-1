5|$|The Court {{makes it}} a federal crime for one lawful gun owner to buy a gun for another lawful gun owner. Whether or not that is <b>a</b> <b>sensible</b> result, the {{statutes}} Congress enacted do not support it—especially when, as is appropriate, we resolve ambiguity in those statutes {{in favor of the}} accused. I respectfully dissent.|$|E
5|$|The Eretrian {{strategy}} was to defend their walls, and undergo a siege. Possibly {{this was the only}} plan that could be agreed on, or became the default option when no plan was agreed. At any rate, since the Persian army had only suffered two defeats in the last century, and since a Greek army had never successfully fought the Persians, this was probably <b>a</b> <b>sensible</b> strategy. Since the Persians arrived by ship, it is probable they had little siege equipment, and indeed, they had already been foiled in the siege of Lindos earlier in the expedition.|$|E
5|$|A {{thorough}} stylistic {{analysis of}} the ornamentation of the monument, in particular of the figures within the circles of the Battle scene and the Scene of sacrifice reveal a surprising sensitivity to bronze {{on the part of}} Cairano, and considerable scope for reinterpretation and commingling of styles. This stemmed from <b>a</b> <b>sensible</b> response to {{the context in which the}} mausoleum was designed and implemented. Unprecedented in Brescia was the combination of bronze and stone, the former under the supervision of Bernardino delle Croci who certainly had a vast catalogue of references to ancient and contemporary works, all of which are cited in the major and minor rounds on the base. It is difficult to exclude Cairano from the influence of so much classicism, but the sole Scene of sacrifice attests to the sophistication of his chisel and the innovative combination of sculpture and bronzes around 1510, to which date much of the remaining lapidary apparatus can also be placed.|$|E

5|$|However, {{others found}} that the {{bundling}} of the games was <b>a</b> <b>sensible</b> business decision, most highlighting {{the risk that the}} sales of Remastered could overshadow those of Infinite Warfare and result in direct competition between the two. Stephen Wright of Gamespresso, meanwhile, agreed with Activision based around the impulsiveness of the Call of Duty fanbase, writing that due to the series' popularity, many of the individuals who felt discontent towards a new title would still choose to buy it regardless. As such, Activision had released the bundle with the knowledge that fans would certainly purchase Infinite Warfare in order to obtain a remaster of Modern Warfare, a game that was held in such high regard. While Wright did disagree with having to pay for an unwanted game in order to obtain another, he expressed faith that the bundle would be good value for money.|$|E
5|$|Schmittou {{and team}} owners arrived at terms in June 1984 to {{purchase}} the Triple-A Evansville Triplets of the American Association, with plans to move the franchise from Evansville, Indiana, to Nashville for the 1985 season. In order {{to prove to the}} team's Nashville banks, which would back the purchase, that the move was financially viable, Schmittou commissioned a survey to evaluate the potential turnout for a Triple-A team versus a Double-A team. Though the research proved to team owners that the move was <b>a</b> <b>sensible</b> decision, the banks were not impressed. As a result, the team switched banks and went ahead with the purchase and relocation. The Southern League wanted Schmittou to surrender his franchise to the league, but he had plans to relocate the team instead. Schmittou wanted to send Nashville's existing Southern League franchise to Evansville to continue as the Triplets at Double-A. However, a combination of the league's disapproval of the move and the City of Evansville being unwilling to upgrade Bosse Field resulted in a move to Huntsville, Alabama, where the team became the Huntsville Stars. The Triple-A Sounds carried {{on the history of the}} Double-A team that preceded it. The Triplets' legacy was retired, and the Stars were established as an entirely-new franchise.|$|E
5|$|The novel, {{described}} as a political, social and ethical commentary {{on the nature of}} good and evil, takes place in the Land of Oz, in the years leading to Dorothy's arrival. The story centers on Elphaba, the misunderstood, smart, and fiery girl of emerald-green skin who grows up to become the notorious Wicked Witch of the West and Galinda, the beautiful, blonde, popular girl who grows up to become Glinda the Good Witch of the South. The story is divided into five different sections based on the plot location and presents events, characters and situations from L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) and its 1939 film adaptation in new ways. It is designed to set the reader thinking about what it really is to be 'Wicked', and whether good intentions with bad results are the same as bad intentions with bad results. Schwartz considered how best to condense the novel's dense and complicated plot into <b>a</b> <b>sensible</b> script. To this end, he collaborated with Emmy Award–winning writer Winnie Holzman to develop the outline of the plot {{over the course of a}} year while meeting with producer Marc Platt to refine the structural outline of the show, spinning an original stage piece rather than creating a strict adaptation of Maguire's work.|$|E

25|$|To {{make this}} {{rigorous}} requires <b>a</b> <b>sensible</b> {{discussion of the}} limiting space of functions, and in this space this is the Stone–von Neumann theorem: any operators X and P which obey the commutation relations {{can be made to}} act on a space of wavefunctions, with P a derivative operator. This implies that a Schrödinger picture is always available.|$|E

Mozart biographer Maynard Solomon has taken a particularly harsh view of Leopold, treating him as tyrannical, , and possessive; Ruth Halliwell adopts a far more sympathetic view, portraying his correspondence as <b>a</b> <b>sensible</b> effort to guide the life of a grossly irresponsible Wolfgang.|$|E
25|$|The {{alliance}} with the Acclimatisation Society {{was considered to be}} <b>a</b> <b>sensible</b> arrangement. There were common interests, the site was well supplied with water and convenient to the city and it was thought at the time that many women and townspeople, who might have hesitated in visiting a purely utilitarian exhibition of produce, animals and farm machinery, may have been induced by the additional attraction of the Acclimatisation Society Gardens.|$|E
25|$|Some {{assemblers}} {{may also}} be able to perform some simple types of instruction set-specific optimizations. One concrete example of this may be the ubiquitous x86 assemblers from various vendors. Most of them are able to perform jump-instruction replacements (long jumps replaced by short or relative jumps) in any number of passes, on request. Others may even do simple rearrangement or insertion of instructions, such as some assemblers for RISC architectures that can help optimize <b>a</b> <b>sensible</b> instruction scheduling to exploit the CPU pipeline as efficiently as possible.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} lambda {{calculus}} terms act as functions on other lambda calculus terms, {{and even on}} themselves, led to questions about the semantics of the lambda calculus. Could <b>a</b> <b>sensible</b> meaning be assigned to lambda calculus terms? The natural semantics {{was to find a}} set D isomorphic to the function space D → D, of functions on itself. However, no nontrivial such D can exist, by cardinality constraints because the set of all functions from D to D has greater cardinality than D, unless D is a singleton set.|$|E
25|$|As {{terms of}} this {{potential}} charter, the directors had undertaken measures to enable the direct link between Castletown and Liverpool to be maintained. An agreement had been reached with the Ramsey Steam Company who would employ their vessel the Manx Fairy on the route. This was seen as <b>a</b> <b>sensible</b> course of action as opposed to sustaining a weekly loss of £12 over the winter months. It can be assumed that the offer of the winter charter was accepted {{as there is no}} published schedule in the Manx Press for the Ellan Vannin from 10 December 1856 until mid-May 1857.|$|E
25|$|Selecting a {{different}} test usually identifies {{a different}} list of significant genes since each test operates under a {{specific set of}} assumptions, and places a different emphasis on certain features in the data. Many tests begin with the assumption of a normal distribution in the data, because that seems like <b>a</b> <b>sensible</b> starting point and often produces results that appear more significant. Some tests consider the joint distribution of all gene observations to estimate general variability in measurements, while others look at each gene in isolation. Many modern microarray analysis techniques involve bootstrapping (statistics), machine learning or Monte Carlo methods.|$|E
