5|$|Faramir's {{decision}} {{to reject the}} One Ring shows influences from a kind of courage and behaviour that was known to Tolkien from the medieval poem The Battle of Maldon. By not taking the Ring, Faramir rejects the desire for power and glory <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> for renown which a defeat of Sauron would bring him.|$|E
5|$|The early European {{settlers}} divided New Zealand into provinces, {{which had}} a degree of autonomy.

The provinces are remembered in regional public holidays and sporting rivalries.|$|E

5|$|Tyrant is {{the code}} {{name of a}} series of boss {{characters}} in the Resident Evil horror video game series by Capcom, introduced in the original Resident Evil in 1996.

5|$|With urbanisation, {{distinctive}} urban accents {{have arisen}} which often differ greatly from the historical accents {{of the surrounding}} rural areas and sometimes share features with Southern English accents. Northern English dialects remain {{an important part of}} the culture of the region, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> of speakers to assert their local identity has led to accents such as Scouse and Geordie becoming more distinctive and spreading into surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Y.Kobayasi {{reported}} the form L.mokusin f. sinensis, {{which he said}} differed from the main species in having a head that was more angular and conical at the top; the form sinensis was also reported in Korea in 1995. Some authors have attempted to define forms of L.mokusin as new species based {{on the degree of}} separation of the apical arms. For example, to contrast with his concept of Lysurus in which the arms were either free or slightly fused, the genus Lloydia was created by Chow in 1935 to contain species in which the tips of the arms were fused. As a result of various differing interpretations of the limits of L.mokusin, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> of some authors to define new species based on perceived differences, the fungus has acquired a lengthy list of synonyms over the years.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942 the Royal Navy {{formed the}} Future Building Committee, chaired by the Deputy First Sea Lord, {{to examine the}} fleet's {{requirements}} {{for the rest of}} the war. Tasked with anticipating the Navy's readiness and requirements for January 1944, the committee realised that a major expansion of naval aviation was required, which meant that more aircraft carriers would be needed. Many factors combined to drive up the size of these new carriers, notably the increasing size and speed of aircraft <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to increase the numbers of aircraft aboard fleet carriers. Another important consideration was the change in carrier tactics from the earlier doctrine of more attacks with smaller numbers of aircraft to the use of large, single airstrikes.|$|E

5|$|Serevi started 2001 {{by leading}} Fiji in the 2001 Rugby World Cup Sevens in Argentina. Fiji were {{defeated}} by Australia in their semi-final; the Australians {{went on to}} lose to New Zealand in the final. In the 2000–01 IRB Sevens World Series, he played in only the London and Wales legs. He also missed the 2001 Hong Kong Sevens, {{the first time he}} had missed the tournament in 12 years. Serevi was omitted from the team due to form, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to develop new players for the 2004 Rugby World Cup Sevens. Fiji's coach at the time, Tomasi Cama, suggested Serevi had lost some pace and age was catching up with him. Serevi's last sevens tournament for the year was the World Games in Akita, Japan. As captain, he led Fiji to the Gold medal after defeating Australia 35–19 in the final.|$|E
5|$|The British and Egyptian governments {{would not}} again attempt major {{intervention}} until 1896, whereupon {{the government in}} Britain was impelled to act by several factors. The Egyptian economy had improved since British administrators commandeered the country's finances. Public sentiment towards Mahdist Sudan had been stoked by several embellished accounts of the Mahdists' savagery <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to avenge General Charles Gordon. France, Britain's longtime competitor in the Scramble for Africa, was beginning to encroach upon the Nile river valley, alongside the Belgians. Finally, it was politically advantageous in Europe for Britain to distract the Khalifa from the Italians in Eritrea, who had been made vulnerable by a recent defeat {{at the hands of}} Menelik II, Emperor of Ethiopia. The government chose Herbert Horatio Kitchener to lead the new expedition, outfitting him with around ten-thousand soldiers and Britain's latest technology: Maxim guns, heavy artillery, and a small fleet of gunboats.|$|E
5|$|The main {{problems}} were {{the pressure of}} time <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> of the U.S. president for secrecy. The Cambodian monsoon, whose heavy rains would hamper operations, was only two months away. By {{the order of the}} president, the State Department did not notify the Cambodian desk at the US Embassy, Saigon, the Phnom Penh embassy, or Lon Nol of the planning. Operational security was as tight as General Abrams could make it. There was to be no prior U.S. logistical build-up in the border regions which might serve as a signal to the communists. U.S. brigade commanders were informed only a week in advance of the offensive, while battalion commanders got only two or three days' notice.|$|E

5|$|Upon Derby's {{retirement}} in 1868, Disraeli became Prime Minister briefly before losing that year's general election. He {{returned to the}} Opposition, before leading the party to winning {{a majority in the}} 1874 general election. He maintained a close friendship with Queen Victoria, who in 1876 appointed him Earl of Beaconsfield. Disraeli's second term was dominated by the Eastern Question—the slow decay of the Ottoman Empire <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> of other European powers, such as Russia, to gain at its expense. Disraeli arranged for the British to purchase a major interest in the Suez Canal Company (in Ottoman-controlled Egypt). In 1878, faced with Russian victories against the Ottomans, he worked at the Congress of Berlin to obtain peace in the Balkans at terms favourable to Britain and unfavourable to Russia, its longstanding enemy. This diplomatic victory over Russia established Disraeli as one of Europe's leading statesmen.|$|E
5|$|After his {{accession}} in Great Britain, George's {{relationship with}} his son (which had always been poor) worsened. George Augustus, Prince of Wales, encouraged opposition to his father's policies, including measures designed to increase religious freedom in Britain and expand Hanover's German territories {{at the expense of}} Sweden. In 1717 the birth of a grandson led to a major quarrel between George and the Prince of Wales. The King, supposedly following custom, appointed the Lord Chamberlain, the Duke of Newcastle, as one of the baptismal sponsors of the child. The King was angered when the Prince of Wales, disliking Newcastle, verbally insulted the Duke at the christening, which the Duke misunderstood as a challenge to a duel. The Prince was told to leave the royal residence, St. James's Palace. The Prince's new home, Leicester House, became a meeting place for the King's political opponents. George and his son were later reconciled at the insistence of Robert Walpole <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> of the Princess of Wales, who had moved out with her husband but missed her children who had been left in the care of the King. However, following the quarrel at the baptism, father and son would never again be on cordial terms.|$|E
5|$|Carol Vernallis, {{author of}} Experiencing Music Video, found homoerotic connotations between Madonna and the mermen. The mermen {{in the video}} exist in a {{self-contained}} world of their own, where they procreate with their own kind, both biologically and socially. The fact that the mermen {{did not seem to}} possess genitalia led Vernallis to believe that the video associated them with other works by Ritts – namely homoerotic sculptural images without penises. Their tails drew different meanings, including sexual ones and Christian symbolism. Since in contemporary art, images of mermen are rare while mermaids are common, they are sometimes called fairies partly because it is not known how they came to be. Vernallis believed that the mysteriousness and the elusiveness of the mermen in the video played a crucial role. They never address the camera directly and are often shown disappearing from view. Vernallis believed that since invisibility was a central theme in the homosexual community, this actually portrayed oppression <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to watch but never be seen.|$|E

5|$|In the 1840s, {{thousands}} of settlers, attracted {{in part by}} the lure of free land, began emigrating west over the Oregon Trail. Leaving drought, worn-out farms, and economic problems behind, they emigrated from states like Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa in the Midwest to Oregon, especially the Willamette Valley {{in the western part of}} the state. After passage of the Homestead Act of 1862 and the discovery of gold in the upper John Day basin, a fraction of these newcomers abandoned the Willamette Valley in favor of eastern Oregon. Some established villages and engaged in subsistence farming and ranching near streams. Settlement was made more practical by a supply route from The Dalles on the Columbia River to gold mines at Canyon City in the upper John Day valley. By the late 1860s, the route became formalized as The Dalles Military Road, which passed along Bridge Creek and south of Sheep Rock. Clashes between natives and non-natives <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> of the U.S. Government to populate the region with Euro-Americans led to the gradual removal of native residents to reservations, including three in north-central Oregon: Warm Springs, Burns Paiute, and Umatilla.|$|E

Despite Jared's silence, police arrest Toby and the three other boys within a few days. Jared decides to tell the police what he saw, as he believes Toby and the other boys will be charged with Tracy's murder; however, on his way into the police station he is confronted by Ricko. Ricko confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy, but claims it was an accident – that she hit her head on a rock when he attempted to have sex with her. He has already told police that he was with Jared all night and asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of mateship. Diane, who still {{has not been able to}} tell Jared that she has cancer due to his behaviour, goes in to have surgery.|$|E
