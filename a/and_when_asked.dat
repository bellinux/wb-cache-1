5|$|One man in {{the village}} could {{accurately}} mimic the sound of many animals, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>asked</b> to imitate the kilopilopitsofy, he made noises {{very similar to that}} of a hippopotamus, even though he had never left the island and said he had never seen an African hippo. When shown photos, others also identified a hippopotamus-like animal, but with larger ears. Several described the creature's last appearance in 1976.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Peel {{was very}} popular and admirers often entertained him socially; he became {{well known for}} liking alcohol. On {{the morning of the}} match that England won after {{following}} on, Peel was intoxicated and had to be sobered up. In 1897, he was suspended by Yorkshire for drunkenness during a match. Although it is unclear what exactly happened—Peel said he slipped when fielding, but Hirst later recalled that he came on the field drunk <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>asked</b> to leave, bowled a ball in the wrong direction—he never played for the county again. Decades later, a widely circulated story suggested that Peel urinated on the pitch before being sent away. Historians consider the story unlikely, and attribute it to a misunderstanding by its reporter. Peel continued to play and coach cricket {{for most of his life}} and in later years became associated with Yorkshire once again. Among his other jobs, he became the landlord of a public house and worked in a mill. He died in 1941 at the age of 84.|$|E

5|$|In December 1996, Ryder {{accepted}} {{a role as}} an android in Alien Resurrection (1997), alongside Sigourney Weaver, who {{had appeared in the}} entire Alien trilogy. Ryder's brother, Uri, was a major fan of the film series, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>asked,</b> she took the role. The film became one of the least successful entries in the Alien film series, but was considered a success as it grossed $161million worldwide. Weaver's and Ryder's performances drew mostly positive reviews, and Ryder won a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Best Actress. Ryder then starred in Woody Allen's Celebrity (1998), after Drew Barrymore turned down Ryder's role, in an ensemble cast. The film satirizes the lives of several celebrities. She later appeared in the music video for Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's Talk About the Blues, which was on their sixth studio album ACME. Ryder also appeared on the cover artwork of its follow up album Xtra-Acme USA, which was made using a screenshot from the previously mentioned music video.|$|E

25|$|In 1939, Pratt played 16 {{games with}} South Melbourne, scoring 72 {{goals for the}} season.

25|$|In 1757, Burke {{published}} a treatise on aesthetics, A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful, which {{attracted the attention}} of prominent Continental thinkers such as Denis Diderot and Immanuel Kant. It was his only purely philosophical work, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>asked</b> by Sir Joshua Reynolds and French Laurence to expand it thirty years later, Burke replied that he was no longer fit for abstract speculation (Burke had written it before he was nineteen years of age).|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, Thursday, 9 May, Chamberlain {{attempted to}} form a National Coalition Government. In talks at Downing Street with Viscount Halifax and Churchill, he indicated that he was quite ready to resign if that was necessary for Labour to enter such a government. Attlee and Arthur Greenwood then joined the meeting, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>asked,</b> they indicated that they must first consult their party (then in conference at Bournemouth), but it was unlikely they could serve in a government led by Chamberlain; they probably {{would be able to}} serve under some other Conservative.|$|E
25|$|Throughout July, Grant {{visited the}} Nordic {{countries}} of Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. He was welcomed by universal cheers and was received by King Christian and Queen Louise of Denmark in Copenhagen. At the dinner, {{he declined to}} drink any wine, {{except for a few}} sips of champagne when the King toasted his health. Grant had initially traveled to the area for a few weeks rest <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>asked</b> to attend a banquet in his honor he declined. He exhibited a significant knowledge of Danish history while admiring their school system and honest industry of the working people.|$|E

25|$|General Bantu Holomisa of the Transkei Defence Force {{forced the}} {{resignation}} and exile of Prime Minister George Matanzima in October 1987 and then overthrew Matanzima's successor, Prime Minister Stella Sigcau in December 1987. Holomisa became the Head of State, and the Transkei was {{from that point}} onwards effectively in (often uneasy) alliance with the African National Congress and provided a relatively safe area for the ANC's activities. In 1990, Holomisa himself evaded a failed attempt to be ousted from his post, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>asked</b> {{about the fate of}} his opponents, he claimed that they had died in the ensuing battles with TDF soldiers. It was later found that those deemed responsible for the foiled coup had only suffered minor injuries, but were subsequently executed without trial.|$|E
25|$|Heraclitus {{was born}} to an aristocratic family in Ephesus, in the Persian Empire, {{in what is now}} called present-day Efes, Turkey. His father was named either Blosôn or Herakôn. Diogenes says that he abdicated the kingship (basileia) in favor of his brother and Strabo {{confirms}} that there was a ruling family in Ephesus descended from the Ionian founder, Androclus, which still kept the title and could sit in the chief seat at the games, as well as a few other privileges. How much power the king had is another question. Ephesus {{had been part of the}} Persian Empire since 547 and was ruled by a satrap, a more distant figure, as the Great King allowed the Ionians considerable autonomy. Diogenes says that Heraclitus used to play knucklebones with the youths in the temple of Artemis <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>asked</b> to start making laws he refused saying that the constitution (politeia) was ponêra, which can mean either that it was fundamentally wrong or that he considered it toilsome. Two extant letters between Heraclitus and Darius I, quoted by Diogenes, are undoubtedly later forgeries.|$|E
25|$|John Gómez (also {{known as}} Juan Gómez and Panther John) was a semi-legendary but real person {{who lived in}} a shack with his wife on {{otherwise}} uninhabited Panther Key near Marco Island in the Ten Thousand Islands region of Southwest Florida in the late 1800s. He was well known along Florida's Gulf coast as an expert hunting and fishing guide, boat pilot, and a teller of tall tales, mostly about himself. His self-reported age and birthplace varied, even on official documents. In the 1870 United States Census, he is listed as having been born in 1828. However, during the 1880 US census, Gómez claimed to have been born in France in 1785; in 1885, he told state census takers that he had been born in Corsica; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>asked</b> for the 1900 US Census, he claimed to have been born in Portugal in 1776. Meanwhile, various contemporary letters and news articles report that Gómez claimed at different times to have been born in 1778, 1781 or 1795 in either Honduras, Portugal, or Mauritius. Most of his supposed birth years would have likely made him the oldest person in the world before his death.|$|E

25|$|Busch's No. 51 {{was parked}} on lap 99 by NASCAR after Busch drove away from track workers that were tending to his car, which {{had run out}} of gas and crashed on the back straightaway after being {{accident}}ally spun out by Jamie McMurray. He had been leading the race before the accident and soon the medical assistance arrived. Busch exited the car but realized that his fuel tank was not completely empty and tried to drive it to the garage for repairs. As a medical bag was dragged with the car and slipped off NASCAR ordered Kurt to stop his car for the medical assistance but Busch did not put his helmet back on after he exited the car and could not hear any orders over the radio. His car ran out of gas just in turn 4 and NASCAR officials picked him up and parked the No. 51 team {{for the remainder of the}} race. Busch said goodbye to his team members since he was to drive the No. 78 car for a multi-year deal after the race <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>asked</b> about the incident, Busch said that he ignored the order because he did not have his helmet on and could not hear his crew chief's order to stop. NASCAR investigation that week proved that this appeal was true and therefore they did not penalize Busch any further after the parking.|$|E
25|$|For the 1997–98 season, the {{retirement}} of Eric Cantona saw Cole emerge as first choice striker once again, and he discovered his best form ever for the club. He became the joint top goalscorer in the Premier League {{during the course of}} the season with 18 goals, including a slew of spectacular goals, one of which (a chip against Everton) had the fans' vote as the Manchester United goal of the season. Cole also developed a strong partnership with Teddy Sheringham (despite considerable personal friction between the two), but United finished trophyless for only the second time in nine seasons as they lost to Arsenal in the end. Cole achieved several personal landmarks in this campaign, scoring his first European hat-trick for the club in an away match at Feyenoord, as well as ending the season as runner-up in the PFA Players' Player of the Year award to Arsenal's Dennis Bergkamp. Despite this accreditation, and being the leading goalscorer in all competitions that season with 25, Cole was omitted from England's 1998 FIFA World Cup squad by then-manager Glenn Hoddle. Cole remained upbeat when interviewed <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>asked</b> about his new-found return to success, he claimed he had found freedom in his life after the injuries of the previous season, saying he had great joy with his newborn son and lived for him and his family in his faith as a Born again Christian. He also claimed the friendship of Ryan Giggs, his roommate on away matches, was a major motivating factor through the tough times when fans doubted him at United.|$|E
