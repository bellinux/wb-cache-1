The fate of the {{building}} was up in the air as the building's owners and the insurance company prepared for ligation on how to proceed with repairs, who would control those repairs, and <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>cost.</b> E/R Partners were proposing deconstructing the building down to the 19th floor and rebuilding from there. Aetna Corporation, the fire insurer, claimed that girders above the 19th level could be repaired and used cutting $115 million in repair costs from the owner's $250 million estimate. Aetna also proposed taking over the reconstruction. E/R Partners spent $50 million securing One Meridian Plaza and spent up to $500,000 a month on security guards, utilities and inspections by engineers as the building stood empty.|$|E

2500|$|The State of California has {{proposed}} that all new low- and mid-rise residential buildings, and all new commercial buildings, be designed and constructed to ZNE standards beginning in 2020 and 2030, respectively. The requirements, if implemented, will be promulgated via the California Building Code, which is updated on a three-year cycle and which currently mandates {{some of the}} highest energy efficiency standards in the United States. California is anticipated to further increase efficiency requirements by 2020, thus avoiding the trends discussed above of building standard housing and achieving ZNE by adding large amounts of renewables. The California Energy Commission is required to perform a cost-benefit analysis to prove that new regulations create a net benefit for residents of the state. There has yet to be publicly released analysis of the impact that ZNE standards may have to construction, real estate, and energy prices in the state.

40|$|An {{important}} question for climate policy making {{is how much}} GHG emissions and energy can be saved, in which sectors and <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>costs?</b> Traditionally, studies looking at this question are often characterised as either using a Bottom-Up or a Top-Down approach. The differences between these approaches are far from clear-cut.

The two approaches have also been used in the IPCC fourth assessment report (AR 4) (IPCC, 2007) in order to assess the medium- term (2030) sectoral potentials and costs of GHG emission reduction. AR 4 finds that at the global level the total emission mitigation potentials and costs of the two approaches are comparable (and presents both results in the summary for policymakers).

Romania duly signed and ratified all the EU decisions taken after her accession but no clear bill was presented to the taxpayer.

30|$|Our study {{provides}} {{insight into how}} the potential availability of forest biomass is spatially distributed across the European continent. We found that the largest total forest biomass potentials per unit of land {{can be found in}} northern Europe (including the Baltic countries), central Europe, Slovenia, southwest France and central parts of Portugal. However, a large part of these potentials are already used to produce materials and energy and there is limited scope for further extraction of biomass in these areas. The location of the currently unused forest biomass potentials only partly coincides with regions that currently have high levels of wood production. This has implications for being able to mobilise and process additional wood volumes as necessary infrastructure may not be in place in these areas to facilitate mobilisation. Our results provide insight into those regions in Europe where policies could focus on an increase of the supply of woody biomass from their resources. Future research on potential biomass availability from European forest should also consider to what extent forest owners would be willing to mobilise additional biomass from their forests and <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>costs</b> the estimated potentials could be mobilised.|$|R

40|$|As {{electric}} vehicles {{appear as a}} potential solution for cleaner deliveries, several constraints affect the attractiveness of electric light commercial vehicles (eLCVs). Our research aims at identifying these constraints as well as quantifying their respective weight. We investigate two types of constraints: operational and economic. Operational constraints determine if an electric vehicle is suitable for a given use; for example, the limited range of operation due to the necessity to recharge the battery. Economic performance, which we examine through Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) computations for electric and conventional vehicles, sheds light upon the trade-offs faced by business users {{when they have to}} choose between several technologies. We then present the results of a disaggregated constraints analysis made on a French database about light commercial vehicles, which assesses the proportion of vehicles that could be replaced by electric ones, and <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>costs.</b> This study shows that, today, eLCVs are competitive for some specific uses, but do not cover the needs of every freight transport operator.

The successful implementation of investment strategies in African agriculture could determine the future of more than one billion people.
