40|$|Abstract. Software {{adaptation}} aims at generating software pieces called <b>adaptors</b> {{to compensate}} <b>interface</b> and behavioural mismatch between components or services. This {{is crucial to}} foster reuse. So far, adaptation techniques have proceeded by computing global adaptors for closed systems {{made up of a}} fixed set of components. This is not satisfactory when the systems may evolve, with components entering or leaving it at any time, e. g., for pervasive computing. To enable adaptation on such systems, we propose tool-equipped adaptation techniques for the computation of open systems adaptors. Our proposal also support incremental adaptation to avoid the computation of global adaptors. ...|$|R

50|$|The Atari 2600 port was {{programmed}} by Brad Stewart. Stewart {{had been}} working on a backup project for the Atari 2600, which was eventually canceled. Consequently, Brad and Ian Shepherd were both available to program Breakout for the Atari 2600. They decided to compete in the original version of Breakout for the programming rights. In the end, Brad won. In development, he didn't receive help of the original designers (and was unaware who they were), and felt that there were few obstacles to overcome. Difficulties arose with the Television <b>Interface</b> <b>Adaptor.</b> The game was published in 1978 and was conceptually the same, but with a few key differences. First, there were only six rows of bricks. Second, the player is given five turns to clear two walls instead of three. One notable addition was the Breakthru variant, where the ball does not bounce off of the bricks, but continues through them until it hits the wall. Atari had this term trademarked and used it as a sister term to Breakout in order to describe gameplay, especially in look-alike games and remakes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Protocol {{conversion}} {{deals with}} the automatic syn-thesis of an additional component or glue logic, {{often referred to as}} an <b>adaptor</b> or an <b>interface,</b> to bridge mismatches between interacting components, often referred to as protocols. A formal solution, called convertibility verification, has been recently proposed, which produces such a glue logic, termed as a converter, so that the parallel composition of the protocols and the converter also satisfies some desired specification. A converter is responsible for bridging different kinds of mismatches such as control, data, and clock mismatches. Mismatches are usually removed by the converter (similar to controllers in supervisory control of Discrete Event Systems (DES)) by disabling undesirable paths in the protocol composition. This paper formulates a generalization of this convertibility verification problem, by using a new refinement called specifica-tion enforcing refinement (SER) between a protocol composition and a desired specification. The existence of such a refinement is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of suitable a converter. We also propose an approach to automatically synthesize a converter if a SER refinement relation exists. The proposed converter is capable of the usual disabling actions to remove undesirable paths in the protocol composition. In addition, the converter can perform forcing actions when disabling alone fails to find a converter to satisfy the desired specification. Forcing allows the generation of control inputs in one protocol that are not provided by the other protocol. Forcing induces state-based hiding, an operation not achievable using DES control theory.

40|$|The simple {{addition}} of a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera to a theodolite makes it safe to measure the pointing direction of a laser beam. The present {{state of the art}} requires this to be a custom addition because theodolites are manufactured without CCD cameras as standard or even optional equipment. A theodolite is an alignment telescope equipped with mechanisms to measure the azimuth and elevation angles to the sub-arcsecond level. When measuring the angular pointing direction of a Class ll laser with a theodolite, one could place a calculated amount of neutral density (ND) filters in front of the theodolite s telescope. One could then safely view and measure the laser s boresight looking through the theodolite s telescope without great risk to one s eyes. This method for a Class ll visible wavelength laser is not acceptable to even consider tempting for a Class IV laser and not applicable for an infrared (IR) laser. If one chooses insufficient attenuation or forgets to use the filters, then looking at the laser beam through the theodolite could cause instant blindness. The CCD camera is already commercially available. It is a small, inexpensive, blackand- white CCD circuit-board-level camera. An <b>interface</b> <b>adaptor</b> was designed and fabricated to mount the camera onto the eyepiece of the specific theodolite s viewing telescope. Other equipment needed for operation of the camera are power supplies, cables, and a black-and-white television monitor. The picture displayed on the monitor is equivalent to what one would see when looking directly through the theodolite. Again, the additional advantage afforded by a cheap black-and-white CCD camera is that it is sensitive to infrared as well as to visible light. Hence, one can use the camera coupled to a theodolite to measure the pointing of an infrared as well as a visible laser...|$|R
5000|$|The Prestel adaptor {{produced}} by Eureaka (Informatika) {{was the first}} adaptor produced for the Oric-1 and Oric Atmos computers. However this adaptor was only furnished with very limited software, which was not suitable for the market at that time. John Henry Patrick Rushton was rumoured to have hacked the circuit - by meticulously removing the 'security compressed resin' surrounding the circuit board - and apparently discovering the 6522 and its workings. It is also believed that this is why he had taught himself 6502 assembly language (for the purpose of writing the necessary software, that a local software-house had refused to write for him, when requested [...] ). It was then in 1983, that the first fully comprehensive communications software for both the Oric-1 and Oric Atmos was produced (Oricoms and Atcoms - distributed by FGC Publications of Euxton, Preston, U.K.). This software, designed and coded by Rushton and the accompanying manual (which was written by Trevor F Shaw) - both of Telford, Shropshire - utilised the 6522 ACIA (Asynchronous Communications <b>Interface</b> <b>Adaptor,</b> which served as a I/O port controller for the 6502 family of microprocessors). This software (the first of its type for the Oric series of computers and was indeed {{one of the early}} pioneers of home computer communications) enabled the Oric-1 and Oric Atmos to communicate with the Prestel videotex system, with Bulletin Boards and facilitated the transfer of files from one Oric-1/Atmos to another, via the public telephone system. The transfer speeds being either 300 or 1,200 baud (this could occur at both full and half duplex). Rushton was later - in the spring of 1984 - to produce the first (for the Oric-1 and Atmos) 'true' high resolution Computer Aided Design (CAD) utilities known as Oricad and Atcad respectively.|$|R
40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. In the United States alone, lung cancer {{accounts}} for ~ 160, 000 deaths per year while the five-year survival rate remains stagnant at ~ 15 %. Lung can be divided into different subsets including small cell and non-small cell lung cancer. Lung Adenocarcinoma (ADCA) accounts for over 50 % of non-small lung cancer cases. Within this subset, KRAS is the most common activating mutation, accounting for ~ 35 % of cases. KRAS mutant tumors have remained a largely un-targetable subtype, and a better understanding of the signaling pathways involved in the different ADCA subtypes will be necessary for the development of therapeutics. Insulin Receptor Substrate- 1 (IRS- 1) is a signaling <b>adaptor</b> protein that <b>interfaces</b> with many of the pathways that are activated in lung cancer, including phosphoinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), extracellular signal regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) and Janus Kinase (JAK) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT). The central theme of this work is to describe novel roles for IRS- 1 in the lung, including its integral role in the interplay between tumor cells and the surrounding tumor microenvironment. A key player in this interaction is the neutrophil, which can have pro-host and pro-tumor roles. We have found that neutrophils present in the tumor microenvironment cause degradation of the intracellular protein IRS- 1, which in turn increases PI 3 K pathway activation leading to increased tumor proliferation. Independent study of IRS- 1 loss with an Irs- 1 -deficient mouse model showed that Irs- 1 loss induces an increase in neutrophil recruitment to the tumor. These two observations reveal a self-perpetuating cycle that causes increased tumor burden and mortality in mice and humans. Loss of Irs- 1 in our Kras mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma induced activated JAK/STAT signaling and induced recruitment of immune cells to the tumor. Since neutrophils are essential for protection against invading pathogens, an indirect method of stopping this cycle must be used. Inhibiting JAK in our mouse model reduced inflammation, which in turn reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival. Overall, this work describes a novel role for IRS- 1 as a mediator of cell growth and immune cell recruitment in lung adenocarcinoma...|$|R
