5|$|The colonial {{government}} in the Congo depended on its military to maintain civil order and, <b>above</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> depended on the loyalty of the native troops who made {{up the bulk of}} the Force Publique. Black non-commissioned Officers led by First Sergeant-Major Ngoie Mukalabushi, a veteran of the East Africa Campaign, munitied at Luluabourg in the central Congolese province of Kasaï in February 1944; the trigger for this was a plan to vaccinate troops who had served at the front, though the soldiers were also unhappy about the demands placed on them and their treatment by their white officers.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the cathedral}} was {{designed}} by French architects, it exhibits a number of differences from the cathedrals of northern France. <b>Above</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> is essentially constructed of brick rather than stone. Brick could easily be produced locally but stone had to be imported from the distant quarries of Gotland. As bricks and mortar are {{not as strong as}} stone, the walls had to be thicker although the pillars needed to support the vaulted ceiling of the chancel were made of limestone (although those in the nave are of brick). The north transept portal is also built of limestone, no doubt as it was needed to support the rose window, also structured in limestone itself. While the chancel and the transept are clearly of French design, the nave which was built somewhat later displays German and Swedish characteristics. Constructed in about 1330, the rose window over the northeast portal is still entirely French. Nicolaus from Västerås, the Swede who directed work on the nave from the 1360s, appears to have slightly modified the original plans, adding confessional side-chapels and including a few features of German origin. It {{is interesting to note that}} cross-vaults were nevertheless installed, rather than star-shaped vaults which were more common at the time. Work on the western end of the building began in 1431 with the construction of the west portal which was influenced by the style of Vadstena Abbey. The towers, however, still exhibited features typical of 13th-century French architecture, indicating that the original plans were still in use at the time. Overall, despite minor differences, Uppsala Cathedral still reflects the style of the 13th-century cathedrals of northern France.|$|E

500|$|<b>Above</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> was Swedish Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) who {{eased the}} task of plant cataloguing. He adopted a sexual system of {{classification}} using stamens and pistils as important characters. Among his most important publications were Systema Naturae (1735), Genera Plantarum (1737), and Philosophia Botanica (1751) {{but it was in}} his Species Plantarum (1753) that he gave every species a binomial thus setting the path for the future accepted method of designating the names of all organisms. Linnaean thought and books dominated the world of taxonomy for nearly a century. His sexual system was later elaborated by Bernard de Jussieu (1699–1777) whose nephew Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu (1748–1836) extended it yet again to include about 100 orders (present-day families). Frenchman Michel Adanson (1727–1806) in his [...] (1763, 1764), apart from extending the current system of family names, emphasized that a natural classification must be based on a consideration of all characters, even though these may later be given different emphasis according to their diagnostic value for the particular plant group. Adanson's method has, in essence, been followed to this day.|$|E
500|$|The feminist {{film critic}} Molly Haskell also wrote an {{approving}} {{review of the}} film in the Village Voice: [...] "In a world, an industry, and particularly a genre which values the new and improved product <b>above</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> {{is nothing short of}} miraculous to see a movie which dares to go backward, a technological artefact which has nobly deteriorated into a human being. I speak of the new and obsolete James Bond, played by a man named George Lazenby, who seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates." [...] Haskell was also affected by the film's emotional ending: [...] "The love between Bond and his Tracy begins as a payment and ends as a sacrament. After ostensibly getting rid of the bad guys, they are married. They drive off to a shocking, stunning ending. Their love, being too real, is killed by the conventions it defied. But they win the final victory by calling, unexpectedly, upon feeling. Some of the audience hissed, I was shattered. If you like your Bonds with happy endings, don't go." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1959, Kelly {{joined the}} {{musician}} {{with whom he}} became most associated – Miles Davis. Adderley, the alto saxophonist in the band, related how Kelly came to replace Red Garland on piano: Davis had admired Kelly's playing as part of Gillespie's band, and Garland was invariably late to arrive for their club performances; [...] "One night, Wynton was there when we started and Miles asked him to sit in. When Red came, Wynton was playing. Miles told Red, 'Wynton's got the gig.' Just like that." [...] Kelly stayed with the trumpeter until March 1963, appearing on the studio albums Kind of Blue and Someday My Prince Will Come, {{as well as on}} numerous concert recordings. On 1959's Kind of Blue, often mentioned as the best-selling jazz album ever, Kelly replaced Bill Evans on the track [...] "Freddie Freeloader". Even though Kelly was Davis' regular pianist, the trumpeter had planned his album with Evans in mind, so this was the only piece that Kelly played. Kelly toured 22 cities in Europe as part of Davis' quintet in the spring of 1960. Fellow pianist McCoy Tyner commented on Kelly's playing with Davis: [...] "His harmonic colorations were very beautiful. But I think <b>above</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> was his ability to swing. John [...] used to mention that. Miles used to get off the bandstand and just look at Wynton with admiration, because he really held the group together." ...|$|E
