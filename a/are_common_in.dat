5|$|Lambic, a beer of Belgium, is {{naturally}} fermented using wild yeasts, rather than cultivated. Many {{of these are}} not strains of brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness. Yeast varieties such as Brettanomyces bruxellensis and Brettanomyces lambicus <b>are</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> lambics. In addition, other organisms such as Lactobacillus bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} {{is a global}} issue since lead mining and smelting, and battery manufacturing/disposal/recycling, <b>are</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> many countries. Lead enters the body via inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption. Almost all inhaled lead is absorbed into the body; for ingestion, the rate is 20–70%, with children absorbing a higher percentage than adults.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many species}} of the genus Suillus, S.brevipes is edible, and the {{mushroom}} is considered choice by some. The odor is mild, and the taste mild or slightly acidic.

5|$|Most {{multiple}} sequence alignment methods try {{to minimize}} the number of insertions/deletions (gaps) and, as a consequence, produce compact alignments. This causes several problems if the sequences to be aligned contain non-homologous regions, if gaps are informative in a phylogeny analysis. These problems <b>are</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> newly produced sequences that are poorly annotated and may contain frame-shifts, wrong domains or non-homologous spliced exons.|$|E
5|$|Northern {{hardwood}} trees <b>are</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> the Fishing Creek watershed. Ruffed grouse {{are common}} along Little Fishing Creek {{and its tributaries}} north of Iola.

5|$|Spirals <b>are</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> {{plants and}} in some animals, notably molluscs. For example, in the nautilus, a {{cephalopod}} mollusc, each chamber of its shell is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor and arranged in a logarithmic spiral. Given a modern understanding of fractals, a growth spiral {{can be seen as}} a special case of self-similarity.|$|E
5|$|The {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion. Mutations and amplification of EGFR <b>are</b> <b>common</b> <b>in</b> non-small-cell lung carcinoma and {{provide the basis for}} treatment with EGFR-inhibitors. Her2/neu is affected less frequently. Other genes that are often mutated or amplified are c-MET, NKX2-1, LKB1, PIK3CA, and BRAF.|$|E
