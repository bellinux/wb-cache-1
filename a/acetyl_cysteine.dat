40|$|Isoprenylcysteine {{carboxyl}} methyltransferase (ICMT) catalyzes the post-translational methylation of C-terminal cysteines of isoprenylated proteins, including small G-proteins and the γ-subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins. It {{is widely}} felt that carboxymethylation promotes efficient membrane {{association of the}} methylated proteins and specific protein-protein interactions. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that ICMT-mediated carboxymethylation of specific proteins (e. g., Rac 1) plays a regulatory role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Western-blot analysis indicated that ICMT is expressed and predominantly membrane associated in INS 832 / 13 β-cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous expression of ICMT markedly attenuated glucose, but not KCl-induced insulin secretion. These findings were further supported by pharmacological observations, which suggested a marked reduction in glucose-, but not KCl-stimulated insulin secretion by <b>acetyl</b> farnesyl <b>cysteine</b> (AFC), a selective inhibitor of ICMT. In addition, glucose-induced Rac 1 activation, a hallmark signaling step involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, was markedly inhibited following pharmacological (AFC) or molecular biological (siRNA-ICMT) inhibition of ICMT. Lastly, we also noticed a marked reduction in glucose-induced acute increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species in INS 832 / 13 cells pre-treated with AFC or transfected with siRNA-ICMT.

40|$|Heavy and {{transition}} metals {{have been widely}} known for their toxicities for centuries. Arsenic and Lead are highly valued in terms of toxicity to living systems due to their high affinity for sulfhydryl (-SH) containing residues. The chemical interactions of Arsenic and Lead with thiols (. SH rich molecules) results in numerous ill-health effects. As {{a part of this}} PhD thesis, the chemical status of GSH was determined in the presence of inorganic and organic complexes of lead and arsenic employing simple spectrophotometric analysis and 1 H NMR methods. The behavior of EllmanÂ�fs reagent towards the metal-thiol chemistry was initially investigatedto begin with the study of the changed status of thiols resulting from metal-thiol coordination. Chapter 2 describes the use of NMR methods to study the species in solutions. 1 H NMRallowed us to identify additional components of the reaction mixture, their relative abundance and consequently the involvement of these additional EllmanÂ�fs based species in the spectrophotometric errors {{associated with the use of}} EllmanÂ�fs reagent. Using 1 H NMR methods we are able to show that EllmanÂ�fs reagent can exchange with thiolates previously coordinated with lead and arsenic. In the context of this 1 H NMR study, some limitations were found to be associated with the use of EllmanÂ�fs reagent in our study. EllmanÂ�fs reagent was found able to react with the thiols being previously attached with arsenic and lead, leading to an over estimation of the thiols in the solution systems. 4, 4 Â�Å’-dithiodipyridine (DTDP) was adapted instead of EllmanÂ�fs reagent for the spectrophotometric determination of the mixtures involving metal-thiols complexes in aqueous solution and biological mixtures after establishing limitations associated with the use EllmanÂ�fs reagent in this capacity of the study. Chapter 3 describes the 1 H NMR carried out to study the conditions and ratios of the complexed thiolates (complexes of both arsenic and lead with some important low molecular weight thiols (Glutathione, N. <b>acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> and D-Penicillamine). 1 H NMR study presented in this chapter provides detailed information about the changes in the chemical status of GSH that might be the basis of this chemical change observed spectrophotometrically in the form of depletion. 1 H NMR methods confirmed metal-thiol adducts (i. e., As-SG 3 and Pb-SG 2) to be the mechanism behind the GSH depletion in the presence of these metal compounds. After establishing the limitation associated with the use of EllmanÂ�fs reagent, 4, 4 Â�Å’- dithiodipyridine was used for the spectrophotometric determination of the unbound thiols in the presence of complexed thiolates in aqueous solutions. In the course study presented in chapter 4, we have spectrophotometrically investigated the reactions of arsenic and lead with sulfhydryl containing thiols i. e., Glutathione, N-Acetyl cysteine and D-Penicillamine in aqueous solutions. In this chapter, the effects of arsenic (Sodium arsenite and Methylarsonous acid) and lead (Lead acetate and Lead acetyl acetonate) on low molecular weight thiols (Glutathione, N. <b>acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> and D-Penicillamine) have been spectrophotometerically quantitated in aqueous solutions. Employing influential variables (i. e., different metal concentrations, incubation times and pH ranges) to the study in aqueous solutions, prominent and regular decrease in the thiol levels were caused by each of the inorganic and organic compounds of arsenic and lead in spectrophotometric analysis. Chapter 5 describes the spectrophotometric estimation of important and most abundant low molecular weight thiol (Glutathione) in the whole blood and blood components (cytosolic Fraction and plasma) of human volunteer. In order to improve our understanding of the coordination chemistry of arsenic and lead in whole blood, cytosolic fraction and Plasma, a systematic study of the changes in glutathione (GSH) levels in these biological samples of healthy human volunteers, has been carried out. The effects of the inorganic and organic compounds of arsenic and lead on glutathione status in these biological samples have been spectrophotometerically evaluated by 4, 4 Â�Å’-dithiodipyridine. Chapter 6 describes the spectrophotometric estimation of Glutathione in WBCs (Lymphocytes and Monocytes) isolated from human blood, while the study carried out in chapter 7 describes the estimation of Glutathione in liver isolated from rabbits. Chapter 8 describes the exchange of arsenic (AsIII) and lead (PbII) between Proteins (Albumin) and low molecular weight thiols (Glutathione, N. <b>acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> and DPenicillamine). In addition to thiol disulfide exchange reactions, the exchange of arsenic and lead between Proteins (Albumin) and low molecular weight thiols (Glutathione, N. <b>acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> and D-Penicillamine) has also been investigated by Column chromatographic methods using EllmanÂ�fs reagent. The exchange behaviour of arsenic and lead between proteins and low molecular weight thiols have been analyzed spectrophotometrically by making use of EllmanÂ�fs reagent. Column chromatographic methods have been used to collect complexed proteins. The sulfhydryls present on the pure and complexed proteins have been estimated spectrophotometerically. The study regarding the thiol disulfide exchange reactions resulted that the low molecular weight thiolates (Reduced glutathione and N-acetylcysteine) take off As(III) and Pb(II) species which are attached to proteins. Results from multiple studies presented in this PhD thesis are consistent to conclude and panticipate that lead and arsenic species are dynamic in nature as in the case of using Ellmanâ€™s reagent, thiolates could be removed from the coordination sphere of the arsenic and lead in As(SR) 3 and Pb(SR) 2 respectively and in the case involving albumin, the slow exchange of lead and arsenic species bound to cys- 34 is the basis for a mechanism by which toxic species can become widely distributed around the body...|$|E
40|$|Metabolic {{disorders}} affect {{much of the}} population, and it {{is widely}} believed that they have a genetic basis as well as being influenced by dietary factors. Recent studies have revealed an important role for the neil 1 gene in the prevention of metabolic diseases. NEIL 1 is a DNA Glycosylase that catalyzes the repair of DNA and mtDNA. We aimed to understand how a deletion in the neil 1 gene in a mouse model would affect susceptibility to high fat and high carbohydrate diets. We also sought to establish a role for pro- and antioxidants in modulating disease risk. To accomplish this, Wild Type (WT) and neil 1 Knockout (KO) mice were placed on either high fat or high carbohydrate diets. In a cohort of animals, the high fat diet was supplemented by the pro-oxidant KBrO 3, or the antioxidant N <b>acetyl</b> <b>cysteine.</b> Under the oxidative stress of a high fat diet, the KO mice gained more weight than the WT mice. A similar difference was observed for the high carbohydrate treatment. The pro-oxidant KBrO 3 seemed to mitigate the weight gain phenotype that was characteristic of a high fat diet, whereas the antioxidant NAC had no effect in both kinds of mice. At this point, the conclusion can be drawn that neil 1 -KO animals are more prone to the weight gain (and attendant effects of metabolic syndrome) induced by high fat and high carbohydrate diets...|$|E
40|$|Radiographic {{contrast}} media–induced tubular injury: Evaluation of oxidant {{stress and}} plasma membrane integrity. BackgroundExperimental and clinical investigations suggest that oxidant stress {{is a critical}} determinant of radiocontrast nephropathy (RCN), and that N <b>acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> (NAC) can prevent this damage. This study addresses these issues directly at the tubular cell level. Potential alternative mechanisms for RCN have also been sought. MethodsIsolated mouse proximal tubule segments (PTS), or cultured proximal tubule (HK- 2) cells, were subjected to radiocontrast media (RCM) (Ioversol, Optiray 320) exposure, followed by assessments of cellular viability [% lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, tetrazolium dye (MTT), uptake] and lipid peroxidation. These experiments were conducted in the absence or presence {{of a variety of}} antioxidants [NAC, glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase, catalase] or pro-oxidant (GSH depletion, heme oxygenase inhibition) strategies. RCM effects on mitochondrial and plasma membrane integrity were also assessed. ResultsRCM exposure did not induce PTS lipid peroxidation. Neither antioxidant nor pro-oxidant interventions mitigated or exacerbated RCM-induced tubular cell injury, respectively. RCM impaired mitochondrial integrity, as assessed by ouabain-resistant ATP reductions, and by cytochrome c release (before cell death). RCM also induced plasma membrane damage, as indicated by loss of key resident proteins (NaK-ATPase, caveolin) and by increased susceptibility to phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) attack (increase of ≥ 2 times in free fatty acid and NaK-ATPase release). Hyperosmolality could not account for RCM's toxic effects. ConclusionRCM toxicity can be dissociated from tubular cell oxidant stress. Alternative mechanisms may include mitochondrial injury/cytochrome c release and plasma membrane damage. The latter results in critical protein loss, as well as a marked increase in plasma membrane susceptibility to exogenous/endogenous PLA 2 attack...|$|E

Circa- dian oscillation of peroxiredoxins (PRDX 1 – 6) redox status {{has been shown}} in mature erythrocytes. We have recently reported that nuclear levels of PRDX 2 are circadian regulated in the HaCaT keratinocytes. In this study, we addressed whether PRDX 2 translocation could influence the TTFL. A reporter HaCaT cell line stably expressing the luciferase gene under control of Bmal 1 promoter was lentivirally trans- duced either with an empty vector (EV), a vector carrying a myc-tagged wild type PRDX 2 (PRDX 2 -Myc) or the same gene with a nuclear localization sequence (PRDX 2 -MycNuc). PRDX 2 overexpressing cells were protected from H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress. The amplitude of the Bmal 1 promoter activity was significantly dampened in PRDX 2 -MycNuc versus EV cells when synchronized either by dexamethasone treatment or temperature cycles. Clock synchronization was not affected in PRDX 2 silenced cells. N- <b>acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> or melatonin treatments, significantly dampened the Bmal 1 promoter activity suggesting that sustained scavenging of ROS impairs clock synchronization. Noteworthy, H 2 O 2 treatment rescued proper oscillation of the clock in synchronized PRDX 2 -MycNuc HaCaT cells. Since the histone deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (Sirt 1) modulates clock gene expression amplitude, the effect of Sirt 1 activator resveratrol or Sirt 1 inhibitor nicotinamide were also investigated. Interestingly, NAM enhanced the molecular clock synchronization in PRDX 2 -MycNuc cells. Our findings demonstrate that PRDX 2 regulates the TTFL oscil- lation by finely tuning the cellular redox status of the nucleus likely influencing the deacetilase activity of SIRT 1 enzyme...|$|E

Contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) is a known adverse effect of intravenous contrast administration. The literature on incidence, pathophysiology, clinical features, and current preventive strategies available for CIN relevant to urologists was reviewed. A search of the PubMed database was done using the keywords nephropathy and media, prevention and control or prevention Contrast media (explode), all adverse effects, and kidney diseases (explode). An online search of the EMBASE database for the time ranging from 1977 to February 2009 was performed using the keywords ionic contrast medium, adverse drug reaction, major or controlled clinical study, human, nephrotoxicity, and kidney disease. Current publications and data most relevant to urologists were examined. CIN was the third most common cause of hospital-acquired renal failure. The incidence is less common with intravenous contrast administration as compared with intra-arterial administration. The pathogenesis of contrast mediated nephropathy is due to a combination of toxic injury to renal tubules and medullary ischemic injury mediated by reactive oxygen species. CIN most commonly manifests as a nonoliguric and asymptomatic transient decline in renal function. Patients who developed CIN were found to have increased mortality, longer hospital stay, and complicated clinical course. An overview of risk factors and risk prediction score for prognostication of CIN are elaborated. Preventive strategies including choice of contrast agents, maximum tolerated dose, role of hydration, hydration regime, etc. are discussed.

40|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} {{remains a}} challenging disease because of incomplete {{understanding of its}} pathobiology {{and the absence of}} an effective specific therapy. To address these difficulties, experimental animal models are indispensable. Recent research has identified the key role of fatty acid ethyl esters in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis, but to date there is no satisfactory experimental model. Since cell signalling abnormalities, including excessive intracellular release of calcium and/or reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) have been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in acute pancreatitis, targeting these pathways could either prevent this disease completely or ameliorate its severity. Such therapies require preliminary assessment in experimental models. A novel acute alcoholic pancreatitis model (F AEE-AP) was established by two concomitant administrations of ethanol (1. 35 g/kg) and palmitoleic acid (80 or 150 mg/kg) at 1 h apart. 4 -methylpyrazole, a non-oxidative ethanol metabolism pathway inhibitor, significantly increased the necrosis histopathological score of the pancreas, whereas 3 -benzyl- 6 -chloro- 2 - pyrone, a F AEE synthase inhibitor, significantly decreased the severity of FAEE-AP. Bis-(4 -nitrophenol) phosphate, an FAEE hydrolase inhibitor, did not show any significant protective effect against F AEE-AP. The inositol trisphosphate receptor inhibitor caffeine and its metabolites were investigated in mice with acute pancreatitis induced by either 7 or 12 injection of caerulein (50 ug/kg/h; CER-AP) or by infusion of 50 III taurolithocholic acid 3 -sulphate (TLC-S, 3 mM; TLCS-AP). Caffeine (25 mg/kg/h) significantly reduced severity markers of pancreatitis in both CER-AP and TLCS-AP, an effect that might be due to inhibition of inositol triphosphate receptor, attenuation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and/or phosphodiesterase inhibition. The caffeine metabolites theophylline and paraxanthine however {{did not appear to be}} protective against CER-AP. Manipulation of ROS by menadione (an oxidant inducer), 2, 4 -dimethoxy- 2 -methylnaphthalene (a non-cycling analogue of menadione) and n- <b>acetyl</b> <b>cysteine</b> (an antioxidant) in both CER-AP and TLCS-AP provided paradoxical results. Cyclophilin D knockout mice, which are resistant to formation of the MPTP, had significantly reduced histopathological scores and severity markers tested compared to wild type mice in FAEE-AP. The cyclophilin D inhibitor cyc 1 osporine A (l 0 mg/kg) did not show a significantly protective effect in CER-AP, while its non-immunosuppressive analogue D- 3 -methyl-Ala- 4 -ethyl-Val-CyA (Debio- 025, 10 - 100 mg/kg) significantly reduced histopathological scores and severity marker of CER-AP with the most marked effect at 10 mg/kg. These data suggest that inhibition of cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium overload could be effective strategies in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of acute pancreatitis.
