5|$|Rarely cultivated, Banksia ilicifolia {{requires}} a sunny position and sandy well-drained soil to do well. A slow-growing plant, it takes {{up to ten}} years to flower from seed. The glossy green foliage and long flowering period, combined with prominently displayed flowers give it horticultural potential, although its prickly foliage makes fallen leaves <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>if</b> planted near lawns or walkways. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 22 to 41 days to germinate. Difficulties in collection and low seed set make seed relatively expensive. Seeds are often eaten by insects {{before they can be}} collected.|$|E
5|$|The loss of {{the weight}} of the gas taken from the {{cylinder}} makes the cylinder and diver more buoyant. This can be <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>if</b> the diver is unable to remain neutrally buoyant {{towards the end of the}} dive because most of the gas has been breathed from the cylinder. The buoyancy change due to gas usage from back mounted cylinders is easily compensated by carrying sufficient diving weights to provide neutral buoyancy with empty cylinders at the end of a dive, and using the buoyancy compensator to neutralise the excess weight until the gas has been used.|$|E

5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the Categorical Imperative provides us with the maxim that {{we ought not to}} lie in any circumstances, even if we are trying to bring about good consequences, such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim. Kant argued that, because we cannot fully know what the consequences of any action will be, the result might be unexpectedly harmful. Therefore, we ought to act to avoid the known wrong—lying—rather than to avoid a potential wrong. If there are harmful consequences, we are blameless because we acted according to our duty. Driver argues that this might not be <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>if</b> we choose to formulate our maxims differently: the maxim 'I will lie to save an innocent life' can be universalized. However, this new maxim may still treat the murderer as a means to an end, which we have a duty to avoid doing. Thus we may still be required to tell the truth to the murderer in Kant's example.|$|E

25|$|North American beavers {{were also}} {{released}} in Finland in 1937, {{before it was}} realized that they formed a separate species. (Eurasian beavers had been extirpated from the region, so the release {{was intended as a}} reintroduction project.) By 1999, it was estimated that 90% of beavers in Finland were the American species. The species is not considered invasive, as in Europe it has a similar keystone effect to European beavers, which have not recolonized the area. The beaver population has been controlled by issuing hunting licenses. A report in 2010 concluded that while the current population was not problematic, as the species has larger litters than European beavers and builds somewhat larger dams, it could become <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>if</b> its range continues expanding into Russia, but this {{does not seem to be}} taking place.|$|E
25|$|When {{searching for}} optimal {{solutions}} to a linear function bound to linear equality and inequality constraints, {{the constraints of}} the problem can be used directly in producing the optimal solutions. There are algorithms that can solve any problem in this category, such as the popular simplex algorithm. Problems that can be solved with linear programming include the maximum flow problem for directed graphs. If a problem additionally requires that {{one or more of the}} unknowns must be an integer then it is classified in integer programming. A linear programming algorithm can solve such <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>if</b> it can be proved that all restrictions for integer values are superficial, i.e., the solutions satisfy these restrictions anyway. In the general case, a specialized algorithm or an algorithm that finds approximate solutions is used, depending on the difficulty of the problem.|$|E
25|$|Input offset voltage: This voltage, {{which is}} what is {{required}} across the op-amp's input terminals to drive the output voltage to zero. In the perfect amplifier, {{there would be no}} input offset voltage. However, it exists in actual op-amps because of imperfections in the differential amplifier that constitutes the input stage of the vast majority of these devices. Input offset voltage creates two problems: First, due to the amplifier's high voltage gain, it virtually assures that the amplifier output will go into saturation if it is operated without negative feedback, even when the input terminals are wired together. Second, in a closed loop, negative feedback configuration, the input offset voltage is amplified along with the signal and this may pose <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>if</b> high precision DC amplification is required or if the input signal is very small.|$|E

25|$|Computer games {{sometimes}} use DRM {{technologies to}} limit the number of systems the game can be installed on by requiring authentication with an online server. Most games with this restriction allow three or five installs, although some allow an installation to be 'recovered' when the game is uninstalled. This not only limits users who have more than three or five computers in their homes (seeing as the rights of the software developers allow them {{to limit the}} number of installations), but can also prove to be <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>if</b> the user has to unexpectedly perform certain tasks like upgrading operating systems or reformatting the computer's hard drive, tasks which, depending on how the DRM is implemented, count a game's subsequent reinstall as a new installation, making the game potentially unusable after a certain period even if it is only used on a single computer.|$|E
25|$|In a population, at most half have values {{strictly}} {{less than}} the median and at most half have values strictly greater than it. If each group contains {{less than half the}} population, then some of the population is exactly equal to the median. For example, if a<nbsp&bnbsp&<nbsp&c, then the median of the list {a,nbsp&b,nbsp&c} is b, and, if anbsp&<nbsp&bnbsp&<nbsp&cnbsp&<nbsp&d, then the median of the list {a,nbsp&b,nbsp&c,nbsp&d} is the mean of b and c; i.e., it is (bnbsp&+nbsp&c)/2. Indeed, as {{it is based on the}} middle data in a group, it is not necessary to even know the value of extreme results in order to calculate a median.

25|$|Air {{circulation}} rate: Drying {{time and}} timber quality {{depend on the}} air velocity and its uniform circulation. At a constant temperature and relative humidity, the highest possible drying rate is obtained by rapid circulation of air {{across the surface of}} wood, giving rapid removal of moisture evaporating from the wood. However, a higher drying rate is not always desirable, particularly for impermeable hardwoods, because higher drying rates develop greater stresses that may cause the timber to crack or distort. At very low fan speeds, less than 1m/s, the air flow through the stack is often laminar flow, and the heat transfer between the timber surface and the moving air stream is not particularly effective (Walker et al., 1993). The low effectiveness (externally) of heat transfer is not necessarily <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>if</b> internal moisture movement is the key limitation to the movement of moisture, as it is for most hardwoods (Pordage and Langrish, 1999).|$|E
