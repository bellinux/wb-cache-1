5|$|Early Seventies Britain {{was a very}} {{depressing}} {{place with}} both the colour strike and the UK postal workers strike in full swing. It was completely run-down with trash on the streets, and total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from {{the wrong side of}} the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at <b>all.</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then a whole bunch of copycat wankers after us.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} {{of the new}} contacts was Busoni. The great pianist and composer became Szigeti's mentor during these formative years, and the two would remain close friends until Busoni's death in 1924. By Szigeti's own admission, before meeting Busoni his life was characterized by a certain laziness and indifference {{brought on by the}} then-typical life of a young prodigy violinist. He had grown accustomed to playing crowd-pleasing salon miniatures and dazzling virtuosic encores without much thought. He knew little of the works of the great masters; he could play them, but not fully understand them. As Szigeti put it, Busoni—particularly through their careful study of Bach's Chaconne—"shook me once and for <b>all</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my adolescent complacency".|$|E
5|$|The shipsthoroughly {{obsolete}} by this timewere briefly {{retained in}} the post-war period before being decommissioned. Nebraska, Georgia, and Rhode Island were transferred to the Pacific Fleet, with the latter serving as the flagship of the 1st Squadron, though they were <b>all</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> service by 1920. Under {{the terms of the}} Washington Naval Treaty, signed in 1922, they were to be discarded as part of the naval armament limitation program. Virginia and New Jersey were sunk as target ships off Cape Hatteras by Army bombers under the supervision of Billy Mitchell in September 1923. The other three ships were sold to ship breakers in November that year.|$|E

25|$|When {{the unit}} attacking the school retreated, {{the one that}} {{was on its way to}} the tell {{suffered}} a severe morale blow. As the Egyptians opened fire from previously unknown positions, it completely surprised the Israelis who had about a third of their force killed or wounded. After the armored forces were <b>all</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the fight, an order was given to withdraw. Only 15 soldiers made it back to the starting positions. Rescue efforts to return the wounded still in the field continued throughout the day. In all, the Israeli forces suffered over 100 casualties and four tanks were destroyed.|$|E
25|$|In 706, in {{association}} with Wu Sansi, Zheng accused the coup leaders, by then <b>all</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the capital Chang'an, of having conspired with Emperor Zhongzong's son-in-law Wang Tongjiao (王同皎), who was executed early in 706 for having planned to kill Wu Sansi and depose Empress Wei. The five coup leaders were demoted to be military advisors to prefects in distant prefecture. Wu Sansi then had accusations about his affair with Empress Wei publicly posted in Luoyang, hoping to incense Emperor Zhongzong and then blame the coup leaders. Zheng then accused the coup leaders of having posted the accusations and requested that their clans be slaughtered. Emperor Zhongzong denied the request, but exiled the coup leaders to even more distant prefectures, where they subsequently died or were killed on Wu Sansi's orders.|$|E

25|$|New South Wales' run of six {{consecutive}} WNCL titles {{came to an}} end in 2002–03, during which Sthalekar had a mediocre season by her standards, scoring 180 runs at 20.00 and taking eight wickets at 37.37 at an economy rate of 3.35 in ten matches. She took more than one wicket only once, with 2/11 from ten overs against South Australia and had a run of four consecutive single-figure scores {{in the middle of the}} season. New South Wales won six of their eight matches and had to play the finals away against Victoria. In the first match, she scored 29 and was then attacked by the home batsmen, taking 1/45 in a three-wicket loss. The next day, she took 1/31 as the hosts were dismissed for 181, but in reply, the defending champions could only make 141 <b>all</b> <b>out,</b> <b>of</b> which Sthalekar made 45.|$|E
25|$|Data {{access to}} the station is {{provided}} by access via NASA's TDRS-4, 5, and 6 satellites, the DOD DSCS-3 satellite, and the commercial Iridium satellite constellation. For the 2007–2008 season, the TDRS relay (named South Pole TDRSS Relay or SPTR) was upgraded to support a data return rate of 50 Mbit/s, which comprises over 90% of the data return capability. The TDRS-1 satellite formerly provided services to the station, but it failed in October 2009 and was subsequently decommissioned. Marisat and LES9 were also formerly used. In July 2016, the GOES-3 satellite was decommissioned due to it {{nearing the end of}} its supply of propellant and was replaced by the use of the DSCS-3 satellite, a military communications satellite. DSCS-3 can provide a 30 MB/s data rate compared to GOES-3's 1.5 MB/s. DSCS-3 and TDRS-4, 5, and 6 are used together to provide the main communications capability for the station. These satellites provide the data uplink for the station's scientific data as well as provide broadband internet and telecommunications access. Only during the main satellite events is the station's telephone system able to dial out. The commercial Iridium satellite is used when the TDRS and DSCS satellites are <b>all</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> range to give the station limited communications capability during those times. During those times, telephone calls may only be made on several Iridium satellite telephone sets owned by the station. The station's IT system also has a limited data uplink over the Iridium network, which allows emails less than 100KB to be sent and received at all times and small critical data files to be transmitted. This uplink works by bonding the data stream over 12 voice channels.|$|E
500|$|Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict looked unfavorably on the episode, {{writing that}} it [...] "has a premise—Bart builds a soapbox racer—that frankly has very limited modern day appeal.

500|$|About 1860, Holmes {{invented the}} [...] "American stereoscope", a 19th-century {{entertainment}} in which pictures were viewed in 3-D. He later wrote {{an explanation for}} its popularity, stating: [...] "There was not any wholly new principle involved in its construction, but, it proved so much more convenient than any hand-instrument in use, that it gradually drove them <b>all</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the field, in great measure, {{at least so far}} as the Boston market was concerned." [...] Rather than patenting the hand stereopticon and profiting from its success, Holmes gave the idea away.|$|E
500|$|The song {{appeared}} partway {{through the}} concert's opening, Indian music segment, which {{was performed by}} Shankar and otherwise composed by her father, Ravi Shankar, who had continued to be Harrison's friend and mentor until his death. Inglis comments that, in its context at the Concert for George, [...] " [...] does not appear at <b>all</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place among the Indian folk and classical compositions that surround it." [...] Reviewing the Concert for George film for The Guardian, James Griffiths admired Lynne's reading of the song as a [...] "particularly sublime version".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{negative}} publicity, many artists who knew Reubens, such as Cyndi Lauper, Annette Funicello, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Valeria Golino, spoke {{out in his}} support.

[...] Other people who knew Reubens, such as Playhouse production designer Gary Panter, S. Epatha Merkerson, and Big Top Pee-wee director Randal Kleiser, also spoke in support. Reubens' fans organized support rallies after CBS canceled the reruns, picketing in Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. The TV news magazine A Current Affair received [...] "tens of thousands" [...] of responses to a Pee-wee telephone survey, in which callers supported Reubens by nine-to-one.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1990, {{a few weeks before}} his 17th birthday, his father led a group of high school math students, {{including}} Sergey, on a two-week exchange program to the Soviet Union. His roommate on the trip was future Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor John Stamper. As Brin recalls, the trip awakened his childhood fear of authority and he remembered that [...] "his first impulse on confronting Soviet oppression had been to throw pebbles at a police car". Malseed adds, [...] "On {{the second day of the}} trip, while the group toured a sanatorium in the countryside near Moscow, Brin took his father aside, looked him in the eye and said, 'Thank you for taking us <b>all</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Russia.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Evita has {{received}} generally mixed reviews from music critics. J.

Authors Allen Metz and Carol Benson wrote in their book The Madonna Companion that the soundtrack gave Madonna [...] "some of the post-disco queen/sex machine credibility she so desperately crave". Writing for the Hartford Courant, Greg Morago complimented Madonna's vocals and her [...] "remarkable understanding of the material... While some of the numbers have lost their sharp edge ('A New Argentina' lacks requisite anger), the recording benefits from its concentration on the characters' voices. There is a vibrant, contemporary energy and fearless cinematic sweep to this welcome new stamp on the mythic life of Eva Duarte de Perón".|$|E
