2500|$|Lowenthal's {{first major}} role in video game voice-overs was as the Prince in Ubisoft's [...] In an {{interview}} with Critical Gamer, he describes that role as [...] "a very lucky break for me, because it ended up being a super game. We audition all the time for <b>all</b> <b>different</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> projects, and videogames are one part of that, a part that I love." [...] He said that [...] " [...] that [...] in a way originated that role". Lowenthal {{did not return to}} voice the Prince in Warrior Within, being replaced by Robin Atkin Downes. Lowenthal felt that this was a conscious decision by Ubisoft to fit in with the game's overall tonal shift, and thought it was the right decision. For The Two Thrones, he returned to play the role, as fans had stated their preference for his portrayal of the character. The Prince became one of Lowenthal's favorite roles, and he was pleased to return to the role for The Forgotten Sands. According to Lowenthal, his well-received performance put pressure on him in future games from both fans and staff, as he needed to remain true to and improve on his original portrayal. This ultimately gave him little creative freedom with the character after The Sands of Time. For the reboots following the live-action films, the staff wanted a different portrayal of the Prince to Lowenthal's, and so recast the role.|$|E
