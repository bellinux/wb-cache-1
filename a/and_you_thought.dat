500|$|Every so often, I’d get a {{call from}} the {{producer}} saying, it’s going out at this time. The publicity people would be alerted, then we’d {{get a call}} saying no, it’s not, it’s been put back. That happened six times, I think, altogether – seven reschedules in a year or so... It was extraordinary and inexplicable, and just one of these things that happen. I mean, a lot of shows are left on people’s desks and they hardly get seen, and Joking Apart was certainly one of those. Meanwhile, they were making about four series of The Brittas Empire, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought,</b> [...] "Bloody Hell! Come on, surely….?" [...] To my mind, our show was a very superior product, and it upset me that other shows, which I, personally, felt were broader and less interesting, were getting precedence.|$|E
500|$|On an {{edition of}} ITV's The South Bank Show in November 1992, Richards commented that Formby [...] "embodied qualities that people admired and found reassuring in the depression... <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> that here's {{a man whom}} {{whatever}} is thrown at him, will come through and come out smiling—and people wanted that". H.J. Igoe, writing in The Catholic Herald, thinks that [...] "Formby has a common English touch. We warm to the kindly turnip face, the revolving eyes, the mouth like a slashed coconut, the silly little songs... the melodiously tinny voice and twanging banjo. The comedian is the universal works—platoon and bar-room simpleton—mother's boy—the beloved henpeck—the father who cannot hang a picture and underlying his everyday folly there is the sublime wisdom of the ordinary fool who loves and trusts the world. His comedy is earthy, but never lascivious".|$|E
500|$|Get Weird, {{their third}} album, was {{released}} on 6 November 2015. With {{the exception of the}} [...] "moody" [...] trap track [...] "Lightning", it saw the group return to a pop music style, though it was noted for its sexualised tone. The song [...] "A.D.I.D.A.S." [...] is an acronym for [...] "All Day I Dream About Sex" [...] and alludes to the sexual act of cunnilingus and fellatio in its lyrics. It also samples the line [...] "hot love and emotion" [...] from [...] "Hold On, We're Going Home" [...] performed by Drake; he, along with the song's other composers Noah [...] "40" [...] Shebib, Majid Al Maskati, Jordan Ullman and Anthony Jeffries, received songwriting credits as a result. [...] "Love Me Like You" [...] is a retro-Motown track reminiscent of Shadow Morton's work. NME writer Nick Levine noted that the lyrics [...] "He was just a dick and I knew it" [...] on [...] "Hair" [...] and [...] "Your voice dropped <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> you could handle me" [...] on [...] "Grown" [...] were two examples of many [...] "sassy" [...] tracks on Get Weird.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{first saw}} <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> worth your salt," [...] shouted Bryce, as {{he brought his}} fist heavily down on the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "Godwin, our ill-luck is {{that you}} love her also, <b>and</b> that <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> the same {{thoughts}} which I did yonder on the quay-head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is n't the}} word, perhaps. We'll say {{ashamed of}} myself. Mrs. Maynard told me about <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> would despise me for not doing or being {{anything}} in particular. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> must." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I remember,' said Matteo. 'You used Sixtus to {{keep the}} Ordelaffi out; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> Girolamo would be a catspaw in our hands.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... [With a sneer.] Well, {{it was a}} {{wonderful}} fine thing you did when you married him, Jenny. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> you done precious well for yourself, too.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Ermine, [...] "it {{will be a}} great {{pleasure}} to poor Julia to be allowed to take us up again, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> the doctor sufficiently convinced." ...|$|E
6000|$|You added, you'll recall, {{that though}} [...] <b>You</b> were {{surprised}} <b>and</b> pained, <b>You</b> <b>thought,</b> upon the whole, you'd go, [...] And in that mind remained.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I know <b>you,</b> Checco, <b>and</b> your pride! As Satan fell by pride, so may you, {{notwithstanding}} {{all your}} riches <b>and</b> power. <b>You</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> were my equal, <b>and</b> because <b>you</b> found me your master you gnashed your teeth and cursed me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have not I eyes, {{though some}} folk have not? Could not I {{look out at}} a chink on a fine summer morning, when <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> the {{children}} asleep? Could not I climb up to your precious cave as well as yourself; and hear the iron clink under the stone. Ha, ha! <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Patience <b>thought</b> no one knew but yourselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, do you {{remember}} when you told me coming to her was an experiment, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> it might be better for the old friendship if you did not accept the situation?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> it was SHE, didn't you? Well, and you're caught! I didn't {{believe it}}; I wouldn't {{believe it when}} they said it. I {{determined}} to find it out myself. And I have; and it's true." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm so glad,' Ernest went on quickly. 'I {{believe all}} real love is {{love at first}} sight. I wouldn't care myself to be loved in any other way. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> I might {{fall in love with}} Lady Hilda?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{will think}} it very funny,", murmured Cecilia pensively. [...] "Oh, <b>and</b> have <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> that taking {{her away from}} where she is will only make those people talk the more?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{someone who}} had beaten <b>you</b> always, <b>and</b> who <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> always would beat you, if you came in contact again. You would not tell me his name. Was it Mr. Carthew?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> so! Really! Kind of you {{to think}} so. <b>And</b> have <b>you</b> just <b>thought</b> about those that are coming, or have you made sure?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, it's all a poem!" [...] {{she exclaimed}} at the end. [...] "It's magnificent; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> I'd laugh!" [...] She looked reproachful. [...] "I think it's {{incredibly}} beautiful. What was his name? We may meet him some time--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, there's Cassandra," [...] said Mrs. Hilbery. [...] "I own I was {{a little}} grudging at first, but, after all, she plays the piano so beautifully. Do tell me, Katharine," [...] she asked impulsively, [...] "where did you go that evening she played Mozart, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> I was asleep?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see it all}} now." [...] A {{brilliant}} inspiration {{had suddenly}} obscured her humour. She sat down suddenly, and he sat down too. [...] "You did it," [...] she said, [...] "because you wanted to help me. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> I was too Conventional to take help from one I might think my social inferior." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I'm glad to {{find you}} so ready with your confession. <b>And</b> so <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> could do a little robbing, and enjoy {{yourself}} in a manner {{you ought to be}} ashamed to own, without being punish'd, did you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yea," [...] said young Gamwell, [...] "and I did so {{look up to}} <b>thee,</b> <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>thee</b> so {{above all}} other men that, I make my vow, had I known who thou wert, I would never have dared to lift hand against thee this day. I trust I did thee no great harm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know that}} it was left for a man from another world, for yourself, John Carter, to teach this cruel Thark what {{friendship}} is; <b>and</b> <b>you,</b> I <b>thought,</b> also roamed the care-free Valley Dor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Unfortunately you didn't; but I {{thought you}} did. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> that I had done it! Mr. Benjamin was too clever for us both, {{and now he}} is going to have penal {{servitude}} for the rest of his life. I wonder who will be the better of it all. Who'll have the diamonds at last?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very {{far from}} jesting, lass. Stalker is your brother Edwin, whom you haven't seen since you {{was a small}} girl, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> was dead. But, come, as the cat's out o' the bag at last, I may as well make a clean breast of it. Sit down here on the bank, Betty, and listen." ...|$|E
6000|$|And on the {{day when}} Gheluvelt lay smoking in the sun, [...] When Von Deimling stormed so hotly in the van, [...] You smiled as Haig reeled {{backwards}} <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> him on the run, [...] But, alas for dreams that vanish, for before the day was done [...] It was you, my Lord of Würtemberg, that ran.|$|E
6000|$|Most of {{you know}} the story of Ruth, from which my text is taken, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>thought</b> it, no doubt, a pretty story. But {{did you ever think}} why it was in the Bible? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then just {{remember}} {{how you felt}} when you first tried to ride a wheel <b>and</b> when <b>you</b> first tried to swim. You got excited, didn't <b>you?</b> <b>And</b> when <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> the wheel was going over you gave it a wild twist that did send <b>you</b> over, <b>and</b> when <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> were going to drown you thrashed around {{in a way that}} only made matters worse. Well, that's a lesson to remember in running a flying machine. Don't get excited and lose your presence of mind, or it may cost you your life. Keep cool, act quickly, but don't overdo a thing. If the machine is tipping a little to one side, don't get excited and throw it clean over the other way. And don't try to make any sharp turns until you know your machine thoroughly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You did {{not know}} us, grandfather," [...] said Ghita simply, her face nearly buried in the old man's bosom. [...] "We have long prayed for <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> reverenced <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>you</b> as a parent whose face was turned from us in anger; but we never sought your gold and honors." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Monna Paula was frightened," [...] {{answered}} Margaret, [...] "and did {{not know}} how to set about the errand, for you know she scarce ever goes out of doors--and so--and so--I agreed to go with her to give her courage; and, for the dress, I am sure you remember I wore it at a Christmas mumming, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> it not unbeseeming." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I want to {{take her}} place, Roberts. I should {{think that if you}} or Andrew were to tell her that you have a friend up from the country who wants just such a place, and is ready to pay five pounds to get one, she might be ready to take the offer; {{especially}} as you might say that you knew of a lady who is in want of an under-housemaid <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> that you could get her the place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not making}} fun of you," [...] said a voice, {{answering}} Prince Darling's thoughts. [...] "You have committed three faults. First of all, you were out of temper because you could not have what you wanted, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> all men and animals were only made to do your pleasure; then you were really angry, which is very naughty indeed; and lastly, you were cruel to a poor little animal who did {{not in the least}} deserve to be ill-treated.|$|E
6000|$|... "O, I <b>thought</b> {{that since}} <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> it {{economical}} enough, certainly I might; <b>and</b> that if <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> {{it necessary to}} keep some sort of cake in the closet, perhaps it was best I should." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} won't go. Why, Mac, I'm {{just getting to}} know <b>and</b> enjoy <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> we'd have a nice time this winter reading {{something}} together. Must <b>you</b> go?" [...] <b>And</b> Rose seemed to forget his strangeness, as she held him still by one button while she talked.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's mere speciousness. Before {{you knew}} {{anything}} of me, <b>and</b> while <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> were {{the child of}} poverty on both sides, you were well enough; but ever since <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> were more than that, you have led a life which is intolerable. What has become of your plan of alliance between the De Stancys and the Powers now? The man is gone upstairs who can overthrow it all.' ...|$|R
