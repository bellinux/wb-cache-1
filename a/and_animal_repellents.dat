40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1983 Modern {{forestry}} practices now {{include the use}} of many controlled release products, such as herbicides, pesticides fertilizers, superabsorbents, growth stimulants <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> <b>repellents.</b> Optimal use of these devices requires models that predict desirable release kinetics. Although some {{progress has been made in}} the development of empirical relationships between environmental data and pesticide persistence in soils, no workers have attempted to develop such models from first principles. Such a model is constructed in this study, and the model predictions are tested by comparison with the field results obtained following application of a slow release systemic repellent to tree seedlings. This deterrent device was designed in the study as an alternative to the chemical and mechanical protectants now available to prevent animal damage to tree seedlings. Selenium, the active agent, is absorbed through the tree's roots, transported to the foliage and thereafter volatilized as dimethyl selenide. This compound is the material responsible for the bad breath of humans who have eaten garlic, which is rich in the element. Eighty percent reduction of browse damage has been achieved by treatment of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) seedlings with low-solubility selenium tablets. Foliage samples collected at various field trial sites treated with the tablets provide data with which to test the model of active agent transport through the soil/plant system. The success achieved in the prediction of foliar selenium content as a function of time demonstrates that it is possible to apply fundamental chemical engineering principles to this complex system. Thus it is now possible to use these concepts to engineer other controlled release delivery systems for applications in both forestry and agriculture, in which the essential physics of the transport process should be identical...|$|E

According to the computer, the Agency has 2, 888 products classified as vertebrate control agents. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act tends to clump all vertebrate pesticides as rodenticides. This includes fish toxicants such as TFM; bird toxicants and repellents such as Starlicide and Avitrol; dog repellents such as lemongrass oil; bat toxicants and repellents such as naphthalene; commensal rodent toxicants such as warfarin, diphacinone, bromadiolone, brodifacoum, and red squill; field use rodenticides for many species (e. g., prairie dogs, ground squirrels) using pesticides such as 1080, strychnine, zinc phosphide; predacides such as 1080 and sodium cyanide; <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> browsing <b>repellents</b> such as thirara and putrescent whole egg solids...|$|R

40|$|Collisions between <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> motor {{vehicles}} are frequent and often result in animal mortality. In Australia, macropods are regular victims of these collisions. This has serious implications for <b>animal</b> welfare <b>and</b> conservation {{as well as}} aesthetics and tourism. Collisions with large <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> secondary collisions caused {{by the presence of}} animals on road easements, can lead to serious personal injury and property damage. A range of mitigative measures to prevent animal-vehicle collisions exists, but no single measure can be fully effective and the efficacy of many mitigation measures remains untested. An integrated management approach, employing many mitigative techniques is required to reduce vehicle-animal collisions. Repellents have recently been identified as a potential mitigative measure for reducing vehicle-animal collisions. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the potential role of repellents in reducing macropod-vehicle collisions in New South Wales. This required the identification and assessment of potential repellents since research investigating repellents in an Australian context is scant. Macropus rufogriseus banksianus was selected as a test species for this research as a high abundance of this species exists in southeastern Australia and it is a common victim of roadkill in New South Wales. Preliminary screening trials of four potential macropod repellents highlighted the utility of two of the substances: Plant Plus, a synthetic compound based on the chemistry of dog urine; and a formulation consisting of chicken eggs. Feeding by M. rufogriseus banksianus was significantly reduced when these substances were applied near feed trays. Modest results were also detected for ? 3 -isopentenyl methyl sulfide (a constituent of fox urine), while a commercial <b>animal</b> <b>repellent</b> (SCATREPLACE 3 Bird <b>and</b> <b>Animal</b> <b>Repellent)</b> was ineffective in altering feeding by M. rufogriseus banksianus.;A barrier trial conducted with the two most successful repellents indicated that Plant Plus was a more effective macropod repellent then the egg formulation. Plant Plus displayed qualities of an area repellent and elicited a stronger response from M. rufogriseus banksianus when compared to the egg formulation. Further captive trials determined that the habituation of response to Plant Plus by M. rufogriseus banksianus was minimal after six weeks of constant exposure and Plant Plus retained repellent properties after exposure to ambient environmental conditions for at least ten weeks. Field trials to establish the effectiveness of Plant Plus with free ranging macropods (M. rufogriseus banksianus and M. giganteus) were unsuccessful due to methodological limitations stemming from high background variance in observed responses, equipment failure and site disturbance from outside influences. The potential role of Plant Plus as a repellent for managing macropod-vehicle collisions was highlighted by the captive trials. However, several factors requiring further research were identified. This included assessing the repellent abilities of Plant Plus in the field and further defining the properties of Plant Plus with captive trials. The effects of Plant Plus on non-target species and an assessment of potential environmental impacts also requires attention. Research assessing the potential role of repellents in other management contexts in Australia would be beneficial and the identification and assessment of repellents for other species should proceed. However, in the context of assessing repellents for use in the management of vehicle-macropod collisions, immediate focus should concentrate on extending the research to assess the effects of Plant Plus with other species of large macropod, and assessing if Plant Plus can reduce the numbers of macropods in road easements...|$|R
50|$|The ideal {{repellent}} {{is completely}} specific for the target animal; that is, it drives away the animal that {{one wishes to}} repel without affecting or harming any other animals or people. One type of <b>animal</b> <b>repellent</b> may be effective for raccoons, while another <b>animal</b> <b>repellent</b> {{may be more effective}} for skunks. It can be difficult to design a repellent method that drives away only undesirable animals while having no effect on people or other creatures.|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the repellency of a commercially available <b>animal</b> <b>repellent</b> {{to determine the}} efficacy of its application to objects that are attractive to coyotes (Canis latrans). Specifically, we aimed to both prevent chewing behavior by coyotes on a nylon-like strapping material, {{which is used to}} construct barrier-arresting systems on military airstrips, and determine the ability of the solution to prevent the animals from repeating the undesired behavior. We mixed RopelÂ® <b>Animal</b> <b>and</b> Rodent <b>Repellent</b> with a liquid latex sticker to form a 2 % latex and 98 % Ropel solution. We used a 2 % latex and 98 % water solution as a control. The solutions were applied to test material placed in coyote pens. We exposed 12 mated pairs of coyotes to the Ropel and control in a 2 -choice test and recorded behavior toward the materials using camera traps. Photographs and the condition of the material were used to determine when, and if, individual coyotes approached, made contact with, tasted, repeatedly tasted, or destroyed the material. There was no difference between the number of treatment and control materials tasted, but significantly more control materials were repeatedly tasted than treatment materials. However, {{there was no difference between}} the number of treatment and control materials destroyed. While results suggest that there are some repellent properties in the Ropel solution after initial tasting, we do not recommend this product be relied upon as a coyote-specific repellent...|$|R

50|$|Dilutions of {{as little}} as 10 ppm are unbearably bitter to most humans. Denatonium salts are usually colorless and odorless solids but are often traded as solutions. They are used as {{aversive}} agents (bitterants) to prevent inappropriate ingestion. Denatonium is used in denatured alcohol, antifreeze, nail biting preventions, respirator mask fit-testing, <b>animal</b> <b>repellents,</b> liquid soaps, <b>and</b> shampoos. It is not known to pose any long-term health risks.|$|R

The term pesticide includes all of the following: herbicide, insecticide, [...] insect growth regulator, nematicide, termiticide, molluscicide, piscicide, avicide, rodenticide, predacide, bactericide, insect <b>repellent,</b> <b>animal</b> <b>repellent,</b> antimicrobial, fungicide, disinfectant (antimicrobial), and sanitizer. The most common of these are herbicides which account for approximately 80% of all pesticide use. Most pesticides are intended to serve as plant protection products (also known as crop protection products), which in general, protect plants from weeds, fungi, or insects.|$|R

50|$|A shark {{repellent}} is any method of driving sharks {{away from an}} area. Shark repellents are a category of <b>animal</b> <b>repellents.</b> Shark repellent technologies include magnetic {{shark repellent}}, electropositive shark repellents, electrical repellents, and semiochemicals. Shark repellents {{can be used to}} protect people from sharks by driving the sharks away from areas where they are likely to kill human beings. In other applications, they can be used to keep sharks away from areas they may be a danger to themselves due to human activity. In this case, the shark repellent serves as a shark conservation method. There are some naturally-occurring shark repellants; modern artificial shark repellants date to at least the 1940s, with the United States Navy using them in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II.|$|R
50|$|Animals {{are known}} to have {{different}} sensitivities to the effects of denatonium. It is used in some <b>animal</b> <b>repellents</b> (especially for such large mammals as deer). It has been used to safeguard rat poisons from human consumption, as humans are able to detect denatonium at much lower concentrations than rodents. However, some cats have been known to be tempted by themâit may not be as effective a deterrent for cats as it is for humans, or perhaps some cats are not deterred due to a genetic factor similar to that affecting human perceptions of the taste of phenylthiocarbamide.|$|R
40|$|Principal methods {{being used}} to {{alleviate}} browsing damage to Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) seedlings by black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) in the Pacific Northwest are <b>animal</b> <b>repellents</b> applied to foliage and plastic mesh cylinders around individual seedlings. As an alternate method, we demonstrated that prompt establishment of highly palatable native forbs reduced summer browsing on planted seedlings {{to the point that}} black-tailed deer were no longer a factor limiting Douglas-fir regeneration. We believe that establishing native forbs is a sound ecological approach to deer-reforestation problems; furthermore, it should have wide utility because it integrates forest- and wildlife-management objectives by promoting prompt regeneration of conifers and enhancing wildlife habitat...|$|R
40|$|Many plant {{defensive}} {{chemicals are}} bitter to humans. Because of this taste characteristic, and because bitter compounds are often toxic, such substances, {{and the plants}} that contain them, are regarded as generally unpalatable to wildlife. These assumptions may be unwarranted. To test the hypothesis that herbivores are indifferent to 2 Ì 7 bitter 2 Ì 7 tastants, we investigated the responsiveness of guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) to denatonium benzoate, denatonium saccharide, limonene, L-phenylalanine, naringin, quebracho, quinine, Ro-Pel (a commercial <b>animal</b> <b>repellent</b> containing denatonium saccharide) and sucrose octaacetate. Only quinine and sucrose octaacetate slightly but significantly reduced feeding (P 3 Ìc 0. 05). Our findings are inconsistent {{with the notion that}} herbivores generally avoid what humans describe as bitter tastes...|$|R
