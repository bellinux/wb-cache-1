5|$|In physics, {{string theory}} is <b>a</b> <b>theoretical</b> <b>framework</b> {{in which the}} {{point-like}} particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings look like small segments or loops of ordinary string. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. Splitting and recombination of strings correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to the interactions between particles.|$|E
5|$|String {{theory is}} <b>a</b> <b>theoretical</b> <b>framework</b> that {{attempts}} to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, {{there is only one}} kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. One of the vibrational states of a string gives rise to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.|$|E

2500|$|When Mendelian {{genetics}} was rediscovered {{by several}} scientists, it initially increased the confusion. The Dutch botanist Hugo de Vries developed a theory called mutationism {{in which most}} variations were inconsequential and could not lead to species change.

At first, geneticists tended to support mutationism; but in the 1920s and 1930s a group of theoretical geneticists [...] particularly Ronald Fisher, J. B. S.
