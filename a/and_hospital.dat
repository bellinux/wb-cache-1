5|$|Charles and Zita were crowned in Budapest on 30 December 1916.

He called Zita several times a day whenever they were separated. Zita had some influence on her husband and would discreetly attend audiences with the Prime Minister or military briefings, and she had a special interest in social policy.

5|$|Edward II {{ordered all}} ports {{on the south}} coast to {{assemble}} their largest vessels at Portsmouth to carry soldiers and horses to the Duchy of Aquitaine in 1324 to strengthen defences.

Concerned, EdwardIII instructed all maritime towns to build vessels and raise troops to rendezvous at Portsmouth. Two years later, a French fleet led by Nicholas Béhuchet raided Portsmouth, destroying much of the town. Only the stone-built church <b>and</b> <b>hospital</b> survived. After the raid, EdwardIII exempted the town from national taxes to aid reconstruction. Upon EdwardIII's death in 1377, his grandson RichardII was crowned, and the French landed in Portsmouth in the same year. The town was plundered and burnt, but its inhabitants fought back and defeated them, which led the French to retreat and raid towns in the West Country instead.|$|E
