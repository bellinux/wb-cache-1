5|$|Chelsea Bridge was {{declared}} a Grade II listed structure in 2008, providing protection {{to preserve its}} character from further alteration.

5|$|The village housed {{people in}} {{five to seven}} groups of round houses, each for an {{extended}} family, with sheds and barns, made of hazel and willow covered with reeds, and surrounded either permanently or at certain times by a wooden palisade. There were gaps in the palisade and is believed by Minnitt and Coles to {{have been used to}} stabilise the clay floors rather than for defensive purposes. At its maximum occupation the village may have had 15 houses in use with a population of up to 200 people. Two distinct phases of occupation have been identified. Early houses were timber framed square or rectangular and built of oak but later buildings were circular huts. Some of the clay spreads were used for barns or <b>animal</b> <b>enclosures</b> rather than houses.|$|E

Night security is carried out under the command of one range officer and other subordinates. The zoo has also employed private security personnel.

25|$|The Government of Tamil Nadu {{provides}} {{funds for}} paying the zoo staff {{and maintenance of}} zoo vehicles. Other expenditures, such as maintenance of <b>animal</b> <b>enclosures,</b> feed for animals, animal health care, maintenance of zoo, drainage, water, electricity and maintenance of battery-operated vehicles, are met from the income generated by the zoo, chiefly {{by means of the}} entry fee. Income is also generated from battery-operated vehicle (BOV) charges, elephant rides, toilets lease, bicycle charges from TI cycles, the leased parking area and food and beverages outlets such as Hotel Tamil Nadu, Aavin, and TANTEA. The yearly budget of the park for its developmental and maintenance work is approved by the governing board.|$|E

25|$|The soaring {{temperature}} in Chennai, especially during summer, demands extra care for {{residents of the}} zoo. Fortunately, the {{temperature in}}side the zoo campus {{is a couple of}} degrees lower than outside any time of the year, primarily due to the lush greenery. The park also maintains an exclusive summer management schedule. All <b>animal</b> <b>enclosures</b> have thatched roofs and fresh river sand spread on the floor to make it cooler for the animals. Water is sprinkled on the sand to provide extra cooling. Roofs of water birds' enclosures are covered with coconut leaves and wet gunny bags. Caves that are exposed directly to the sun are put under a shower twice a day. The enclosure for the king cobra has an air conditioner in order to provide an environment similar to its natural habitat as the species cannot withstand the summer heat. For birds, the topmost part of the cage is covered with jute bags, and water is sprinkled three times a day. Based on the temperature, cucumber, buttermilk, apple and banana are also served to herbivores. The zoo has also set up sprinklers to help animals beat the summer heat and is planning to set up about 20 more sprinklers at the deer safari.|$|E
