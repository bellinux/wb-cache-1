Rupert disavows all his previous talk of superiority and inferiority, realizing {{that there is no way}} to define these concepts objectively, then seizes Brandon's gun and fires several shots out the window to attract attention. As police sirens approach, Rupert pulls up <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the chest and the film's end credits appear on the screen.|$|E
500|$|Caraeff {{stood on}} <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> {{the edge of}} the stage while taking a series of four {{monochrome}} pictures of Hendrix burning his guitar. Caraeff was close enough to the fire that he had to use his camera as a shield to protect his face from the heat. Rolling Stone later colorized the image, matching it with other pictures taken at the festival before using the shot for a 1987 magazine cover. According to author Gail Buckland, the fourth and final frame of [...] "Hendrix kneeling in front of his burning guitar, hands raised, {{is one of the most}} famous images in rock." [...] Author and historian Matthew C. Whitaker wrote: [...] "Hendrix's burning of his guitar became an iconic image in rock history and brought him national attention." [...] The Los Angeles Times asserted that, upon leaving the stage, Hendrix [...] "graduated from rumor to legend". Author John McDermott commented: [...] "Hendrix left the Monterey audience stunned and in disbelief at what they'd just heard and seen." [...] According to Hendrix: [...] "I decided to destroy my guitar at the end of a song as a sacrifice. You sacrifice things you love. I love my guitar." [...] The performance was filmed by D.A. Pennebaker, and later included in the concert documentary Monterey Pop, which helped Hendrix gain popularity with the U.S. public.|$|E

Francine, still insisting on her claim to Mirabel's arm, got <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him. As she seated herself, she left him free for a moment. In that moment, the infatuated man took an empty chair {{on the other side of}} him, and placed it for Emily. He communicated to that hated rival the information which he ought to have reserved for Francine. [...] "The committee insist," [...] he said, [...] "on my proposing one of the Resolutions.

At which she answer'd there he is, pointing to a Chair at a little Distance: The young Gentleman turning his Head, saw a grave Kind of a Man sitting in an Elbow-Chair, tho' he said, he could have sworn there was no body in the Chair when the old Woman shut the Door; however, having promis'd not to speak to any body but the old Woman, he said not a Word.|$|E
60|$|Of this {{assurance}} Magdalen {{felt very}} glad, when {{at the door}} of the parish room, where the ladies were to hold a working party for the missions, Carrigaboola Missions at Albertstown, she and her nieces were introduced to the two ladies in hoods and veils; and Paula's eyes sparkled with delight as she settled into <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Sister Mena. She looked as happy as Vera looked bored! Conversation was not possible while a missionary memoir was being read aloud, but the history of Mother Constance, once Lady Herbert Somerville, but then head at Dearport, and founder of the Daughter Sisterhood at Carrigaboola. To the Merrifields it was intensely interesting, and also to Magdalen; but all the time she could see demonstrations passing between Paula and Sister Mena, a nice-looking girl, much embellished by the setting of the hood and veil, as if the lending of a pair of scissors or the turning of a hem were an act of tender admiration. So sweet a look came out on Paula's face that she longed to awaken the like. Vera meantime looked as if her only consolation lay in the neighbourhood of a window, whence she could see up the street, as soon as she had found whispers to Mysie Merrifield treated as impossible.|$|E

Gottfried Chodowiecki (1728 Gdansk - 1781 Berlin) was a German painter and draftsman and the younger brother of Daniel Chodowiecki. The two brothers moved to Berlin in 1741 to be educated by their uncle. In 1754, Gottfried gave up working as a merchant to concentrate on his artistic career. He was a miniaturist and enameler, though he never gained such popularity as his brother, Daniel, who eventually employed him at his workshop as one of many assistant engravers. Their greatest joint achievement were illustrations to Johann Bernhard Basedow's "Elementartwerk," published in 1770. They were etched by Gottfried according to sketches prepared by Daniel.

50|$|Instead of a save feature or extra lives, {{the villain}} Sutekh would throw Nightshade into a deathtrap. The first four traps {{each had a}} {{solution}} and Nightshade would escape back onto the streets of Metro City (minus some popularity points). The final one does not, and the player would have to start over {{from the beginning of}} the game. Additionally the game begins with Nightshade tied to <b>a</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> which Sutekh has placed a small bomb. While technically not a deathtrap (the bomb, if not escaped on time, does not do lethal damage) this introduces the trap-escape/problem-solving element early on.|$|E
5000|$|Inquizition was {{probably}} most {{famous for its}} mysterious anti-host, the Inquizitor. The Inquizitor was not a typical game show host of the time (enthusiastic, energetic) [...] - [...] he was angry, cranky, and had little patience for wrong answers. Further, he rarely called contestants by their first names, instead opting to use a more gentlemanly approach ("Mr. Roberts", [...] "Miss Johnson"). During the game, he was seen only from behind as a figure in a dark business suit with shoulder-length gray hair, seated in <b>a</b> <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> a table that held {{a glass of water}} and an hourglass.|$|E
5|$|Nevill {{was found}} in the kitchen, dressed in pyjamas, lying over <b>an</b> {{overturned}} <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the fireplace, amid a scene suggestive of a struggle. He had been shot eight times, six times to the head and face, fired when the rifle was a few inches from his skin. The remaining shots to his body had occurred from at least two feet away. Based on where the empty cartridges were found—three in the kitchen and one on the stairs—the police concluded that he had been shot four times upstairs, but had managed to get downstairs where a struggle took place, and during which he was hit several times with the rifle and shot again, this time fatally.|$|R

2500|$|As a detective, Seedman {{was known}} for his unorthodox {{approaches}} that solved otherwise perplexing cases. [...] "I try to imagine who was in a room the second before the murder," [...] he recalled years later. In one case early in his career, a Bronx woman was found dead of a shotgun blast in the lobby of her apartment building. Seedman noticed <b>an</b> empty <b>chair</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the building's stoop. Neighbors told him it was usually occupied by a man who sat there watching the traffic go by. Although he normally was out shopping at the time, Seedman insisted on entering the man's apartment through a window—where he found his body hanging from a pipe. The murder-suicide had occurred after the woman rejected him.|$|R
