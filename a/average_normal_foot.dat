40|$|Three <b>normal</b> <b>feet</b> {{and three}} feet exhibiting talipes equino varus from infants were {{dissected}} and their anatomy studied and compared. The tibiae were immobilised in plaster {{and held in}} a bench clamp while the range of dorsiflexion (extension) was studied before and after immobilisation of either the medial or lateral, or of both groups of tendons. Movements at the subtalar and ankle joints were studied as well as factors controlling movements at the subtalar joint. There was minimal subtalar movement in <b>normal</b> <b>feet</b> during dorsiflexion (extention) but for the clubbed feet the joint showed far greater movement.

[Purpose]	 This	study	examined	the	differences	in	muscle	activation	between	flat	and	<b>normal</b>	<b>feet</b>	in the one-leg {{standing}} position which delivers the greatest load {{to the lower}} extremity.

[Methods] The leg used for one leg standing was the dominant leg of the subjects.

Design: Observational study. Setting: Field-based study among competing athletes. Participants: Volleyball players competing in the Victorian State League, Australia. Assessment of Risk Factors: Patellar tendinopathy (PT) is common in sports involving running and jumping and can severely limit athletes' ability to compete. Several studies have investigated potential etiological factors for the development of PT, but little is known about the association between PT and foot posture. Main Outcome Measures: Static foot posture index (FPI), patellar tendon pain during single-leg decline squatting, and gray scale ultrasound imaging were measured in 78 recreational to elite volleyball players (48 men and 30 women). Results: Men with patellar tendon pain were more likely to have a <b>normal</b> <b>foot</b> posture and men without pain were more likely to be pronated according to the FPI (P 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV) or clubfoot is {{a common}} {{pediatric}} congenital foot deformity that occurs 1 in 1, 000 live births. Clubfoot is characterized by four types of foot deformities: hindfoot equinus; midfoot cavus; forefoot adductus; and hindfoot varus. A structured assessment method for clubfoot is essential for quantifying the initial severity of clubfoot deformity and recording the progress of clubfoot intervention. Aim: This study aims to develop a three-dimensional (3 D) assessment method to evaluate the initial severity of the clubfoot and monitor the structural changes of the clubfoot after each casting intervention. In addition, this study explores {{the relationship between the}} thermophysiological changes in the clubfoot at each stage of the casting intervention and in the <b>normal</b> <b>foot.</b> Methods: In this study, a total of 10 clubfoot children who are < 2 years old will be recruited. Also, the data of the unaffected feet of a total of 10 children with unilateral clubfoot will be obtained as a reference for <b>normal</b> <b>feet.</b> A Kinect 3 D scanner will be used to collect the 3 D images of the clubfoot and <b>normal</b> <b>foot,</b> and an Infrared thermography camera (IRT camera) will be used to collect the thermal images of the clubfoot. Three-dimensional scanning and IR imaging will be performed on the foot once a week before casting. In total, 6 – 8 scanning sessions will be performed for each child participant. The following parameters will be calculated as outcome measures to predict, monitor, and quantify the severity of the clubfoot: Angles cross section parameters, such as length, width, and the radial distance; distance between selected anatomical landmarks, and skin temperature of the clubfoot and <b>normal</b> <b>foot.</b> The skin temperature will be collected on selected areas (forefoot, mid foot, and hindfoot) to find out the relationship between the thermophysiological changes in the clubfoot at each stage of the casting treatment and in the <b>normal</b> <b>foot.</b> Ethics: The study has been reviewed and approved on 17 August 2016 by the Sydney Children's Hospitals Network Human Research Ethics Committee (SCHN HREC), Sydney, Australia.

This study aimed to assess the relationship between dynamic rearfoot motion and FPI scores in pronated and <b>normal</b> <b>foot</b> types. Methods: 40 participants were recruited with equal numbers of pronated and <b>normal</b> <b>foot</b> types as classified by their FPI score. Three dimensional rearfoot motion was collected for each of the participants. Dynamic maximum rearfoot eversion was correlated with the total FPI score across all participants and within the <b>normal</b> and pronated <b>foot</b> types. Linear correlations were performed between components of the total FPI scores measuring frontal plane rearfoot position and maximum rearfoot eversion. The capacity of the total FPI score to predict maximum frontal plane motion of the rearfoot was investigated using linear regression analysis. Results: The correlation between the total FPI score and maximum rearfoot eversion was strongly positive (r = 0. 92, p < 0. 05).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Favorable to {{excellent}} clinical {{results have}} been reported for isolated subtalar joint arthrodesis. Pedobarography after subtalar bone-block distraction arthrodesis have demonstrated a more laterally shifted gait line. However pedobarographic measurements after primary in-situ isolated subtalar arthrodesis have not been reported. This is the first study considering this. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Physical examination, AOFAS Hindfoot score, full weightbearing anterior/posterior and lateral radiographs were assessed in 15 feet. Peak pressures, ground reaction force and force distribution at foot-flat and push-off were measured. RESULTS: Average AOFAS-Score significantly improved. Subjective satisfaction was high. Non-union was found in 1 foot (7 %), screws were removed in 4 of the 15 feet (27 %). One new asymptomatic arthritic talonavicular joint was found. The pressure and force distributions under the operated and contralateral foot showed a different pattern compared to a <b>normal</b> <b>foot.</b> Ground reaction force under both the operated and contralateral feet were lower than a <b>normal</b> <b>foot.</b> DISCUSSION: This study found good clinical, subjective and radiographic results matching that of the reported literature. However, pedobarographic assessment suggests that great functional differences still remain when compared to a <b>normal</b> <b>foot.</b> Subtalar arthrodesis may induce an abnormal gait pattern by preventing compensation of axial rotation of the tibia. This is also reflected in the unaffected side, which may indicate an effort in the general locomotor control to keep a symmetrical gait pattern. This finally alters the pressure and force distribution under both feet. Nevertheless, subtalar arthrodesis is considered a valuable treatment for various isolated subtalar disorders...|$|R

Objectives To determine {{the patterns of}} foot arch growth, factors influencing foot arch growth, and the timing for intervention in er- rant growth patterns. Methods A cross-sectional study evaluated the foot arches of chil- dren aged 0 - 18 years according to age and sex. Subjects included had no evidence of physical abnormality other than flat foot, knock- knee, or bow leg. Subjects were grouped per year of age. Data on foot arch class, age, sex, weight, height, medial intercondylar dis- tance, and medial intermalleolar distance were recorded. Chi- square test, correlation, binary and linear regressions, general lin- ear model, and contrast matrix were performed. Results In 8376 children aged 0 - 18 years, flat foot grade 3 had stable proportions in all age groups. Flat foot grade 2 and 1 had smaller proportions in older age groups than in younger ones. The proportions of <b>normal</b> <b>foot</b> was greater in older age groups. Boys {{at the age of}} 7 and girls at 9 have a small percentage of pes cavus. The mean foot arch measurements were consistent with flat foot grade 2 at age 0 - 3 years, flat foot grade 1 at 4 years, and <b>normal</b> <b>foot</b> at age 18. Median foot arch measurement of children 0 - 10 years old was consistent with flat foot grade 1, while that of chil- dren 11 years old was consistent with <b>normal</b> <b>foot.</b> Age and height gave positive influence. Based on these measurements we infer that the optimal time for intervention is 0 - 7 years for boys and 0 - 3 years for girls.
