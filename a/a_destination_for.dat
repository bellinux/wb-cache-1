But mitochondria {{are not only}} <b>a</b> <b>destination</b> <b>for</b> the phospholipids they finish synthesis of; rather, this organelle also {{plays a role in}} inter-organelle trafficking of the intermediates and products of phospholipid biosynthetic pathways, ceramide and cholesterol metabolism, and glycosphingolipid anabolism.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{had begun}} his law {{practice}} dealing primarily with commercial issues but won greater prominence in Cincinnati {{as a criminal}} defense attorney, defending several people accused of murder.

As Cincinnati was just across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state, it was <b>a</b> <b>destination</b> <b>for</b> escaping slaves and many such cases were tried in its courts. A staunch abolitionist, Hayes found his {{work on behalf of}} fugitive slaves personally gratifying as well as politically useful, as it raised his profile in the newly formed Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Bia≈Çystok {{has been}} <b>a</b> <b>destination</b> <b>for</b> {{internal}} and foreign immigration, especially from Central and Eastern Europe.

Bia≈Çystok's pre-World War II Jewish population constituted about 63 percent of the city's total population of 107,000. World War II changed all of this, in 1939, around 107,000 people lived in Bia≈Çystok, but in 1946 ‚Äì only 56,759, and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of the city's history.
