There is yet a final stop down the northern slope immediately after the Sutaungpyei Pagoda called the Mwegyi hnakaung (Two Great Snakes) Pagoda. It has the images of two great cobras that were believed to frequent the hill to pay their obeisance to the Buddha and above these images seated are those of two Nats that they became when they died. Pilgrims stuff bank notes in the cobras' mouths and pray. The Champac, with its fragrant white blossoms on branches like candelabra, grows wild on the hill, along with the crimson red flowers over the feathery foliage of the Flame tree. Sunset over the river and the western hills as seen from Mandalay Hill can be <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>experience,</b> and crowds of tourists may be encountered in the evenings enjoying it.|$|E
500|$|Joshi, {{one of the}} lyricists, was {{impressed}} with the director, Rakeysh Mehra, who was ready to adjust to his style of writing as well as his creativity. Confessing that the film's soundtrack was his favorite out of all his previous works, Joshi felt that it [...] "was <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>experience</b> getting to know the mindset of today's youth and to pen down their feelings". Speaking about one of his songs, [...] "Luka Chuppi", in which veteran Lata Mangeshkar sang with Rahman, Joshi said that it was developed while discussing with Rahman the scene about a mother losing her son. Joshi wrote the lyrics about the mother and son playing hide-and-seek with the sad reality of the son being hidden forever. He confessed to have been in tears while Mangeshkar was singing the song. The soundtrack won the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director, and had two of its tracks, Khalbali and Luka Chuppi, considered for an Academy Award for Best Original Song nomination.|$|E

She commented to the Yorkshire Evening Post about her experience acting in the film: [...] "Filming it was such <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>experience.</b> I learned an incredible amount and the team became very close. We are all incredibly proud of the film." [...] Breckin told the Irish Independent the intent was to portray realistic scenes in the film: [...] "We wanted it as realistic as possible in terms of young people having fun. Sex isn't glamorous[...]" [...] She commented to Sky News: [...] "It's about us, it's about young people. Hopefully people can identify with that. It had {{to be that the}} audience can relate to my character, that they can see how she gets herself in certain situations and how easily that can happen." [...] Donkey Punch is Breckin's first feature film. LoveFilm observed that Donkey Punch is [...] "acted with conviction by a cast of newcomers".|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} {{is one of}} the longest-serving in British soap, coming third behind Ken Barlow and [...] Emily Bishop in a 1998 survey assessing character episode appearances in Coronation Street's history. In 1999, when Betty was celebrating 30 years on-screen, Alison Boshoff of the Daily Mail praised the character's never changing style: [...] "for 30 years, one favourite fixture of Coronation Street has remained exactly the same [...] barmaid Betty Turpin. With her neatly-set hair, comfortable, bustling manner, and brilliant smile, she has been dispensing homespun advice – and, of course, those celebrated hotpots – at the Rovers Return for more than a generation." [...] Commenting on her 30th anniversary with the show, Betty Driver said, [...] "It is just amazing that I've been here for 30 years. I suppose I have never really counted up the time I've been with the show, because I still enjoy it so much and am always looking forward rather than back. Really, it has been <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>experience</b> and I feel very glad I was able to stick around for so long." ...|$|E
500|$|The maniacal {{schoolmaster}} was {{voiced by}} Waters, and actress Trudy Young supplied the groupie's voice. Backing vocals were {{performed by a}} range of artists, although a planned appearance by the Beach Boys on [...] "The Show Must Go On" [...] and [...] "Waiting for the Worms" [...] was cancelled by Waters, who instead settled for Beach Boy Bruce Johnston and Toni Tennille. [...] Ezrin's suggestion to release [...] "Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2" [...] as a single with a disco-style beat did not initially find favour with Gilmour, although Mason and Waters were more enthusiastic. Waters was opposed {{to the idea of}} releasing a single at all, but became more receptive once he listened to Ezrin and Guthrie's mix of the song. With two identical verses the song was felt to be lacking, and so a copy was sent to Griffiths in London with a request to find children to perform several versions of the lyrics. Griffiths contacted Alun Renshaw, head of music at the nearby Islington Green school, who was enthusiastic about the idea, saying: [...] "I wanted to make music relevant to the kids – not just sitting around listening to Tchaikovsky. I thought the lyrics were great – [...] "We don't need no education, we don't need no thought control..." [...] I just thought it would be <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>experience</b> for the kids." ...|$|E
500|$|Of the {{starring}} cast, Pryce, Hurt, Redgrave and Tutin {{were already}} established screen actors, while Ayola had previously only acted theatrically. She appraised of her screen debut: [...] "it was <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>experience</b> {{for me to}} be appearing alongside so many established names. It was very exciting although I must admit at first I was a bit daunted by the prospect." [...] The film featured several minor black characters, either as members of Gabriel's family, or as workers aboard the ship. When these roles were cast, complaints were made by black members of the British actors' union to the BBC and the Department of Employment at having been [...] "passed over" [...] in favour of overseas artists. The film was shot from 23 September to 6 November 1992. It was funded in the most part by the BBC, though a quarter of the budget came from the American Miramax. While Kidron had previously come to dislike directing for major studios when filming My Cousin Vinny for Fox, she found the low budget of Great Moments in Aviation [...] "just as horrendous a compromise". Though originally intended for theatrical release, the film failed to find theatrical distribution. It was first screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 1994, then broadcast in Britain on BBC Two on 11 November 1995. It was released on video in the United States under the alternate title Shades of Fear two years later, on 11 November 1997.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed on August 6, 7 and 8, 1998, and was {{directed}} by Nigel Dick. After being chosen, Dick received criticism from his colleagues about wanting to work with Spears. He responded saying, [...] "It's a great song. I don't know anything about Britney. I never watched The Mickey Mouse Club. She seems like a great kid and she's very enthusiastic, but I just love the song. It's just a great song". The video's original setup was in high contrast to what eventually became the final product. The plan {{was to have the}} video in a cartoon-like environment, in a likely attempt to attract the audience of younger children. Spears was unhappy with this, and argued that she wanted her video to reflect the lives of her fans and wanted to set the video in a school. Spears pitched this idea to Dick, and further explained she wanted the video to have dance scenes. The original setting was scrapped and replaced with Spears's concept. Dick's original idea for the wardrobe was jeans and a T-shirt, but during the wardrobe fitting Spears decided to change it for a schoolgirl outfit. Dick said that [...] "Every piece of wardrobe in the video came from Kmart, and I was told at the time not one piece of clothing in the video cost more than $17. On that level, it's real. That probably, in retrospect, is a part of its charm." [...] The knotted shirt design was Spears's idea, she recollects saying, [...] "The outfits looked kind of dorky, so I was like, 'Let's tie up our shirts and be cute'". About the experience of shooting her first music video, Spears said, [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>experience.</b> All these people there, working for you. I had my own trailer. It was an amazing experience". The music video was shot at Venice High School, the same school used to film the movie Grease. The video premiered on MTV and other video stations in November 1998.|$|E

I had <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>experience</b> {{in spite of all}} the naysayers."

2500|$|Whilst Rouvas was {{disappointed}} with his seventh-place finish, announcing to Greek media [...] "I am so sorry, I {{wanted us to}} win", there was still unanimous support towards the artist himself in the country. [...] "Seventh in Europe, first in our hearts" [...] many journalists reported on Greek television. The media and public pronounced their support for Rouvas, the general consensus being that the artist gave it his best even though this did not translate in enough votes in the contest. All criticism in Greece focused on {{the selection of the}} song itself, rather than the artist's performance. Rouvas stated that, overall, it has all been <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>experience</b> for him: [...] "some win, some lose, personally, I gave everything I had.

Two years later, she was cast in a lead role in the thriller film Dillinger (1973) as John Dillinger's girlfriend, Billie Frechette. The film was critically acclaimed, and Variety said of her performance: [...] "Phillips, making her film bow after having {{been a member of}} the Mamas & the Papas singing group, scores heavily as Dillinger’s girlfriend," [...] while The New York Times noted it as [...] "mildly effective." [...] Phillips was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer for her performance. Reflecting on the film, Phillips said: I was so lucky to have been surrounded by really great actors. Everybody in that movie was a real actor: Warren Oates, Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman, Richard Dreyfuss, Harry Dean Stanton. It was just <b>a</b> <b>wonderful,</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>experience</b> for me and I had so much support and so much help and so much encouragement. That was really my first movie.
