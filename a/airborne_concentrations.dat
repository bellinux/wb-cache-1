40|$|Abstract—If air {{sampling}} {{is to be}} used to estimate occupational exposure to particulate contaminants both temporal and spatial variation in the <b>airborne</b> <b>concentration</b> and the statistical variation inherent in the sampling process must be correctly taken into account. The latter may generally be neglected when particle number concentrations are high. Protection levels for some important radionuclides however correspond to very low particle concentrations. Statistical variation in the number and sizes of particles collected can then significantly affect the sample activity and the <b>airborne</b> <b>concentration</b> estimated from it. This paper describes a Monte Carlo simulation of the sampling process which has been used to investigate the effect of sample size and aerosol size distribution on intersample variability. The distributions of sample activity predicted by the model are markedly asymmetric. This should be recognised if sample data obtained under such conditions are to be used to estimate potential exposure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{plutonium}} material {{within the}} nuclear devices would be aerosolized, {{released from the}} source-term and deposited in the soil after nuclear tests or accidents. Due to the natural and artificial disturbances the plutonium aerosols deposited in the soil would resuspend into the air. The hazard analysis of plutonium aerosol resuspension in typical dated nuclear-polluted regions is significative for radiation assessment and post-accident depuration in contaminated regions. The analysis shows that the soil eroding is the intrinsic factor of plutonium aerosol resuspension. The <b>airborne</b> contaminated <b>concentration</b> in non-nuclear source-term {{is much higher than}} nuclear source-term. The soil cleanup would lead to short-term rise of the <b>airborne</b> <b>concentration.</b> From the estimation of the equivalent dose, {{it is clear that the}} radiation hazards of the resuspended particulates in typical dated nuclear-polluted regions are extremely limited.

In addition to elevated <b>airborne</b> <b>concentrations,</b> levels of these constituents in surface snow are high during April.

40|$|Rhodococcus equi causes severe pneumonia, {{resulting}} in disease and sometimes death of foals. Infection {{is thought to}} occur by inhalation of dust contaminated with virulent R equi. A recent study of 3 horse breeding farms in Ireland found <b>airborne</b> <b>concentrations</b> of virulent R equi to be significantly higher in stables than in paddocks.

Two farms in central Kentucky with recurrent R equi pneumonia in foals were studied from February through July 2008. Air samples were collected and environmental factors were measured hourly for a 24 -hour period each month from stalls and paddocks used to house mares and their foals at each farm. In 2009, samples were collected from 47 foals from stalls at a single horse-breeding farm in central Kentucky on days 1 - 2, days 7 - 9, and days 14 - 16 of life. Concentrations of airborne virulent R equi were determined via a modified colony immunoblot technique. <b>Airborne</b> <b>concentrations</b> of virulent R equi were significantly higher (P = 0. 016) from 6 : 00 A.

However, diabetes mortality has not been evaluated. This ecological study correlated <b>airborne</b> <b>concentrations</b> of these metals with diabetes mortality in North Carolina counties. Methods: County level data were extracted from the 2000 US Census, the 1999 US Environmental Protection Agency National Air Toxins Assessment, and 2001 - 2005 diabetes mortality rates by county from the North Carolina State Center for Health Statistics. Multivariable linear regression correlated <b>airborne</b> <b>concentrations</b> of each element with diabetes mellitus mortality rates in all 100 North Carolina counties controlling for county-level characteristics. <b>Airborne</b> <b>concentrations</b> were logarithmically transformed to normalize their distribution. Results: The lowest air concentrations detected were beryllium and cadmium, with nickel showing the highest concentration. Logarithmic concentrations spanned from 3. 74 to 4. 02 orders of magnitude. County-level diabetes mortality rates were negatively associated with median county income, but positively associated with county-level air concentrations of arsenic, beryllium, cadmium and nickel. Conclusions: These results support diabetes mortality effects of air pollution, and agree with other studies correlating arsenic, beryllium, cadmium and nickel with diabetes prevalence.

The asbestos was identified in 7 rock and 3 soil samples collected in the serpentinite area. The geometric means of <b>airborne</b> <b>concentrations</b> of asbestos and nonasbestos fibers longer than 0. 2 µm in length were: 384 and 447 fibers/liter (f/L) in the quarry property boundary (in operation), 12 and 124 f/L in the quarry property boundary (in closed), 5 and 103 fibers/liter in the serpentinite area, and less than 2 and 59 fibers/liter in the reference area, respectively.

Unhealthy dwellings present higher <b>airborne</b> <b>concentrations</b> of Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Cladosporium than control dwellings, irrespective of the room sampled. Bedroom walls were more highly contaminated by molds than others. Dwellings occupied by allergic patients differed significantly for <b>airborne</b> <b>concentrations</b> of Penicillium only, but not for wall surface contamination, whereas bathroom walls were more highly contaminated than other rooms. Molecular identification of 12 Penicillium species showed Penicillium chrysogenum and Penicillium olsonii to be the two main species. From the total average of molds, by impaction method, useful thresholds can be given: below 170 CFU/m(3), between 170 and 560 CFU/m(3), 560 and 1000 CFU/m(3) and above 1000 CFU/m(3), respectively for dwellings with low, moderate, high, and very high concentrations.

Practical Implications A single measure of <b>airborne</b> <b>concentrations</b> of molds by impaction allows to establish useful thresholds by social services to estimate in a objective way the housing moldiness.

Chronic exposure to these alpha-diketones at elevated <b>airborne</b> <b>concentrations</b> {{has been associated with}} lung damage, specifically bronchiolitis obliterans, most notably in industrial food processing facilities.

Additionally, the authors performed real-time Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of the workersâ breathing zone as well as the area workplace air for the presence of organic compounds to determine the sources, as well as quantitate and identify various organic compounds proximal to the roasting and grinding processes. Real-time FTIR measurements provided both the identification and quantitation of diacetyl and 2, 3 -pentanedione, as well as other organic compounds generated during coffee bean roasting and grinding operations. <b>Airborne</b> <b>concentrations</b> of diacetyl in the workersâ breathing zone, as eight-hour time-weighted averages were less than the ACGIH TLVs for diacetyl, while concentrations of 2, 3 -pentanedione were below the limit of detection in all samples. Short-term breathing zone samples revealed <b>airborne</b> <b>concentrations</b> for diacetyl that exceeded the ACGIH short-term exposure limit of 0. 02 parts per million (ppm) in two samples collected on a grinder operator. FTIR analysis of air samples collected from both the workersâ breathing zone and area air samples revealed low concentrations of various organics with diacetyl and 2, 3 -pentanedione at concentrations less than the limit of detection for the FTIR methods. Neither the breathing zone nor area air samples measured using the FTIR reflected <b>airborne</b> <b>concentrations</b> of organic compounds that, when detected, approached the ACGIH TLVs or regulatory standards, when available. FTIR analysis of headspace of ground coffee beans revealed ppm concentrations of expected alpha diketones, carbon monoxide and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Coffee roasting and grinding, with adequate building ventilation and typical roasted bean handling and grinding, appears to generate very low, if any, concentrations of diacetyl and 2, 3 -pentanedione in the workersâ breathing zones.
