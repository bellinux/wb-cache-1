5|$|<b>A</b> <b>river</b> is {{a natural}} watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, <b>a</b> <b>river</b> simply flows into the ground or dries up {{completely}} before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called <b>a</b> <b>river.</b> Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes <b>a</b> <b>river</b> {{is said to be}} larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language. <b>A</b> <b>river</b> is part of the hydrological cycle. Water within <b>a</b> <b>river</b> is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).|$|E

40|$|Spring rise is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the natural fluctuations in <b>a</b> <b>river’s</b> water level. Flooding is a natural part of <b>a</b> <b>river’s</b> relationship with its surrounding floodplain, and <b>a</b> <b>river’s</b> native wildlife and plant life become specially adapted to <b>a</b> <b>river’s</b> annual rise and fall. The frequency, duration, magnitude and timing of <b>a</b> <b>river’s</b> floods determine the types of species that associate with the river, over time creating an interdependent food web and ecosystem. In addition to controlling river biodiversity, spring rises affect the physical environment by adding nutrients to the surroundings, creating habitats for certain species, and making areas of the floodplain available as habitat and feeding areas for aquatic species...|$|R
