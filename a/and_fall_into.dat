5|$|When the {{two sides}} met in late-February, {{a week before the}} brawl game, during the third period, Flyers winger Mark Recchi was {{following}} Martin Havlat of the Senators when he crossed into the Philadelphia defensive zone. As this happened, Recchi hooked Havlat, causing both of the players to collide <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the boards. When Havlat got up from the ice, angered by Recchi's hook, he took his stick above him and slashed Recchi, hitting him in the face.|$|E

5|$|During the war, {{the castle}} was {{involved}} in an armed stand-off with French naval vessels. After the Fall of France in 1940, some of the French ships had {{made their way to}} British ports, including Portsmouth, but fears rose that the warships might leave <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> German hands. On 23 June, the castle was ordered to man its guns and to be prepared to fire on the French navy to prevent their departure; one gun, albeit not ready for action, was levelled at the fleet and the French destroyer Léopard responded by aiming its guns at the castle, but no shooting ensued. On 3 July, under Operation Grasp, British forces boarded and seized the ships, ending the confrontation.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} fight as undisputed welterweight champion, he fought Cosme Rivera on May 14, 2005, at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Judah sent Rivera {{down with a}} {{straight}} left hand to the face less than 30seconds into the bout. Rivera beat the count, but was knocked down again about 10seconds later. Judah hit Rivera hard {{several times in the}} second round, and in the third round, he connected with a left uppercut, that caused Rivera to stagger backwards <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the ropes before hitting the canvas. Rivera rose at the count of five, but he was badly hurt and the referee stopped the fight.|$|E
5|$|The Austrians {{planned to}} {{fight their way}} out eastward but—using a local double agent, usually known by his cover of François Toli—attempted to deceive Bonaparte into {{thinking}} {{they would try to}} march north, cross the Po, and head for Milan, joined by the remaining troops marching up from Genoa. The spy would advise Bonaparte to march via Sale on the northern side of the plain, so that he could be engaged by the Austrian left wing; meanwhile the main force would move through Marengo village in the centre, turn north, <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the French left flank. Ott arrived from Montebello of 13 June in a war council. The senior generals of the Austrian army strongly approved this plan, as the alternative would have meant that the Austrian army would have had to retreat along the river Po and leave Piedmont to the enemy without a fight. Nonetheless, by abandoning the San Giuliano plain, where the superior Austrian cavalry could have given him an edge, Melas probably made a serious mistake.|$|E

5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{has been}} in use for many years but, {{given the number of}} people buried in such a small area, the bodies are no longer decomposing properly. They have begun to overflow <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the neighbouring houses as greater excavations take place and basement walls are weakened. The entire area is also permeated with a foul smell, turning fresh produce rotten in far shorter times than natural and tainting the breath of those who live there. Baratte finds that he has both friends and enemies in the area – the cemetery is both loved and hated by the people of the district. He finds resistance from all sides, notably Ziguette who strikes Baratte during his sleep in opposition to his work. He befriends the church's flamboyant organist named Armand, recruits his old colleague Lecoeur to assist with the excavation, is monitored by the infamous Guillotin and falls in love with Heloïse, widely known in the area as a whore.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back on Cybertron, Bumblebee {{struggles to}} {{maintain}} control, particularly after Ratbat's plots to have Skywarp assassinate him during a memorial for the Lost Light (which was presumed destroyed during its launch). Prowl and Arcee foil the attempted murder thanks to Starscream, who sees no benefit to restarting the war, {{and begins to}} work with Bumblebee and Metalhawk {{to form a new}} united government for Cybertron. Though many Decepticons are provided with jobs <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> line, Bombshell continues with mysterious experiments that result in Prowl, {{at the end of his}} tether and increasingly emotionally closed-off, executing him. Fortunately, Ironhide is able to prevent chaos by successfully petitioning to have the I/D chips installed in the Decepticons turned off, restoring a sense of equality. Ironhide then recruits the Dinobots to join him in venturing into the wilderness to searching for the missing Aerialbots, only to go missing themselves. It is while they are being searched for by the other Autobots, Decepticons and NAILs that something else is discovered instead: a Metrotitan has returned to Cybertron, and it dubs Starscream the destined leader of the Transformer race. Before Starscream can exploit this new standing to any great extent, Megatron makes a surprising return and is taken into custody, causing the Decepticons to riot in the streets. It turns out that Megatron has secretly been working with a small team of Decepticons within Iacon to perfect the combination process, and he creates a new, more-powerful Devastator out of the Constructicons and Prowl, who has been under the mind-control of the still-living Bombshell. Ironhide, the Dinobots and the Aerialbots—now Superion—make a triumphant return to take Devastator down, while Megatron himself is neutralized by a failsafe created by Wheeljack. In the chaos, however, Starscream kills Metalhawk and uses his death to secure his position as sole ruler of Iacon, casting the Autobots and Decepticons out into the wilderness.|$|E

25|$|The {{second major}} group of pitcher plants are the monkey cups or {{tropical}} pitcher plants {{of the genus}} Nepenthes. In the hundred or so species of this genus, the pitcher is borne {{at the end of}} a tendril, which grows as an extension to the midrib of the leaf. Most species catch insects, although the larger ones, such as Nepenthes rajah, also occasionally take small mammals and reptiles. Nepenthes bicalcarata possesses two sharp thorns that project from the base of the operculum over the entrance to the pitcher. These likely serve to lure insects into a precarious position over the pitcher mouth, where they may lose their footing <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the fluid within.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a common}} sense of {{confusion}} between the difference of PTSD and a normal response to trauma. If an athlete injures himself or herself in a horrific way, it is normal {{for them to go}} through some adversity before overcoming the injury. They may develop small flashbacks, have bad dreams, or feel like they can't get the traumatic experience out of their mind, however, depending on the athlete’s mental ability, or how determined they are within their chosen sport, these symptoms can be lifted in time. Along with this, those athletes who are weaker mentally are the ones who tend to not be able to recover themselves <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the category of PTSD.|$|E
25|$|One of the grafters, an {{unidentified}} Navarrese (identified by early commentators as Ciampolo) is {{seized by the}} demons, and Virgil questions him.

VIII) for accepting bribes to let prisoners escape) and Michel Zanche (a corrupt Vicar of Logodoro under King Enzo of Sardinia). He offers to lure some of his fellow sufferers {{into the hands of}} the demons, and when his plan is accepted he escapes back into the pitch.

25|$|The {{beginning}} of modern company law {{came when the}} two pieces of legislation were codified under the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856 {{at the behest of}} the then Vice President of the Board of Trade, Mr Robert Lowe. That legislation shortly gave way to the railway boom, and from there the numbers of companies formed soared. In the later nineteenth century depression took hold, and just as company numbers had boomed, many began to implode <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> insolvency. Much strong academic, legislative and judicial opinion was opposed to the notion that businessmen could escape accountability for their role in the failing businesses. The last significant development in the history of companies was the decision of the House of Lords in Salomon v. Salomon & Co. where the House of Lords confirmed the separate legal personality of the company, and that the liabilities of the company were separate and distinct from those of its owners.|$|E
