Many {{of the family}} are, however, {{reluctant}} to enter areas of direct sunlight where it breaks through the forest canopy. Antbirds will engage in anting, a behaviour in which ants (or other arthropods) are rubbed on the feathers before being discarded or eaten. While this has conventionally been considered a way to remove and control feather parasites, {{it has been suggested}} that for antbirds it may simply be <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the distasteful substances in prey items.|$|E

500|$|The BSA holds {{a congressional}} charter under Title 36 of the United States Code, {{which means that}} {{it is one of}} the {{comparatively}} rare [...] "Title 36" [...] corporations in the United States. [...] On behalf of the BSA, Paul Sleman, Colin H. Livingstone, Ernest S. Martin, and James E. West successfully lobbied Congress for a federal charter for the BSA which President Woodrow Wilson signed on June 15, 1916. One of the principal reasons for seeking a congressional charter was as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with competition from other Scout organizations including the United States Boy Scouts and the Lone Scouts of America, The 1916 statute of incorporation established this institution among a small number of other patriotic and national organizations which are similarly chartered, such as the Girl Scouts of the USA, the American Legion, the Red Cross, Little League Baseball, and the National Academy of Sciences. [...] The federal incorporation was originally construed primarily as an honor; however, it does grant the chartered organization some special privileges and rights, including freedom from antitrust and monopoly regulation and complete control over the organization's symbols and insignia. The special recognition neither implies nor accords Congress any special control over the BSA, which remains free to function independently.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} several appearances {{by several}} frequent guest stars, including Todd Buonopane as NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav, Cheyenne Jackson as TGS cast member Danny Baker, Chris Parnell as Dr. Leo Spaceman, and Sherri Shepherd as Angie Jordan {{the wife of}} Tracy Jordan. Buonopane, Jackson, Parnell, and Shepherd made their fifth, eighth, sixteenth, and sixth appearances on the show, respectively. In an interview with TV Guide in November 2010, co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock revealed that Shepherd's character [...] "will be getting her own Real Housewives-type reality show. Having the cameras around forces Tracy to act on better behavior." [...] This {{is evident in the}} following episode [...] "Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning". Tina Fey, the series creator, executive producer and lead actress on 30 Rock, told Entertainment Weekly, in regards to Angie's reality show, [...] "We're hoping to, maybe, if we can get away with it, do an entire episode that's just an episode of Queen of Jordan. Now I'm just superimposing my own TV viewing habits onto 30 Rock." [...] In the episode, Dr. Spaceman informs Tracy Jordan—played by Tracy Morgan—that he is dying, television columnist Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times wondered if this subplot was written as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with Tracy Morgan's recent kidney transplant as he is expected to miss several episodes to recover from the procedure.|$|E

It was directed by Leythum and written by Eric Pearson, with music by Paul Oakenfold. The short was filmed over 2-3 days. Clark Gregg and Maximiliano Hernández return to portray Agent Phil Coulson and Agent Jasper Sitwell, respectively, from the films. They are joined via archive footage by Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark / The Consultant, William Hurt as General Thaddeus [...] "Thunderbolt" [...] Ross and Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky in his Abomination form. Co-producer Brian Winderbaum said the producers [...] "wanted to {{paint a picture of}} S.H.I.E.L.D. pulling the strings and being responsible for some of the events seen in the films. What better character to represent this idea than Agent Coulson, the first S.H.I.E.L.D. agent we were introduced to in the first Iron Man film?" [...] Gregg said he was told about the short film program in the same phone call that warned him Coulson would die in The Avengers. The actor noticed that the One-Shots could then provide more information on Coulson, to [...] "build the audience's relationship [...] him" [...] before his impactful death. The Consultant was written after A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer, due to the latter taking up 80% of the budget Marvel reserved for the two shorts, leaving a remaining budget [...] "for two guys talking". To help with this, Pearson included Sitwell in the short, who had a minor role in Thor, and had him and Coulson [...] "brainstorming <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with this red tape bureaucratic politics of the Avengers Initiative".|$|E

After the film was completed, Eastwood never worked with Leone again, later turning down the role as Harmonica in Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), for which Leone had personally flown to Los Angeles to give him the script. The role eventually went to Charles Bronson. Years later, Leone exacted his revenge upon Eastwood during the filming of Once Upon a Time in America (1984) when he described Eastwood's abilities as an actor as being like a block of marble or wax and inferior to the acting abilities of Robert De Niro, saying, [...] "Eastwood moves like a sleepwalker between explosions and hails of bullets, and he is always the same—a block of marble. Bobby first of all is an actor, Clint first of all is a star. Bobby suffers, Clint yawns."
