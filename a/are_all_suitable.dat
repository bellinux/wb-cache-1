25|$|The {{choice of}} chain {{extender}} also determines flexural, heat, and chemical resistance properties. The most important chain extenders are ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO or BDO), 1,6-hexanediol, cyclohexane dimethanol and hydroquinone bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether (HQEE). All of these glycols form polyurethanes that phase separate well and form well defined hard segment domains, and are melt processable.

60|$|Smoke Printing.--When other {{apparatus}} {{is not at}} hand, a method of obtaining very clear impressions is to smoke a plate over a lighted candle, to press the finger on the blackened surface, and then on an adhesive one. The following details must, however, be borne in mind: the plate must not be smoked too much, {{for the same reason}} that a slab must not be inked too much; and the adhesive surface must be only slightly damped, not wetted, or the impression will be blurred. A crockery plate is better than glass or metal, as the soot does not adhere to it so tightly, and it is less liable to crack. Professor Bowditch finds mica (which is sold at photographic stores in small sheets) to be the best material. Certainly the smoke comes wholly off the mica on to the parts of the finger that touch it, and a beautiful negative is left behind, which can be utilised in the camera better than glass that has been similarly treated; but it does not serve so well for a plate that is intended to be kept ready for use in a pocket-book, its softness rendering it too liable to be scratched. I prefer to keep a slip of very thin copper sheeting in my pocket-book, with which, and with the gummed back of a postage stamp, or even the gummed fringe to a sheet of stamps, impressions can easily be taken. The thin copper quickly cools, and a wax match supplies enough smoke. The folders spoken of (p. 42) may be smoked instead of being inked, and are in some cases preferable to carry in the pocket or to send by post, being so easy to smoke afresh. Luggage labels that are thickly gummed at the back furnish a good adhesive surface. The fault of gummed paper lies in the difficulty of damping it without its curling up. The gummed paper sold by stationers is usually thinner than luggage labels, and still more difficult to keep flat. Paste rubbed in a very thin layer over a card makes a surface that holds soot firmly, and one that will not stick to other surfaces if accidentally moistened. Glue, isinglass, size, and mucilage, <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>suitable.</b> It was my fortune as a boy to receive rudimentary lessons in drawing from a humble and rather grotesque master. He confided to me the discovery, which he claimed as his own, that pencil drawings could be fixed by licking them; and as I write these words, the image of his broad swab-like tongue performing the operation, and of his proud eyes gleaming over the drawing he was operating on, come vividly to remembrance. This reminiscence led me to try whether licking a piece of paper would give it a sufficiently adhesive surface. It did so. Nay, it led me a step further, for I took two pieces of paper and licked both. The dry side of the one was held over the candle as an equivalent to a plate for collecting soot, being saved by the moisture at the back from igniting (it had to be licked two or three times during the process), and the impression was made on the other bit of paper. An ingenious person determined to succeed in obtaining the record of a finger impression, can hardly fail altogether under any ordinary circumstances.|$|E

Those four methods were mass balance based on solvent extraction (methanol, water, THF, or acetone), mass balance based on vacuum drying at 140 °C, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and elemental analysis based on nitrogen.

40|$|A novel {{quantitative}} {{method for}} {{the determination of}} proteins in aqueous solutions {{has been based on}} the quenching of the resonance scattering light of colloidal silver chloride in the presence of proteins. The detection limits for eight kinds of proteins (BSA, HSA, egg albumin, human gamma-IgG,alpha-chymotrypsin, E. Coli. alpsase, myoglobin, a-casein) were at about 8 ng/mL; the linear ranges of the calibration curves were 10 - 400 ng/mL under optimal conditions,except for human gamma-IgG (20 - 400 ng/mL), myoglobin (10 - 300 ng/mL), and a-casein (10 - 300 ng/mL). Three wavelengths (398 nm, 475 nm, 499 nm) <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>suitable</b> for the determination and any acidity from pH 3. 0 to pH 9. 0 could be chosen. A few non-protein substances at high concentration levels interfered with this method, but this problem could simply be overcome by diluting the samples before the assay. Mechanism studies showed that the quenching effect of proteins on the scattering light of colloidal silver chloride was mainly due to the coagulation of AgCl particles retarded by protein. The method was employed for the determination of total protein in human serum with sactifactory results...|$|R

50|$|Chain extenders (f = 2) {{and cross}} linkers (f ≥ 3) are low {{molecular}} weight hydroxyl and amine terminated compounds that {{play an important role}} in the polymer morphology of polyurethane fibers, elastomers, adhesives, and certain integral skin and microcellular foams. The elastomeric properties of these materials are derived from the phase separation of the hard and soft copolymer segments of the polymer, such that the urethane hard segment domains serve as cross-links between the amorphous polyether (or polyester) soft segment domains. This phase separation occurs because the mainly nonpolar, low melting soft segments are incompatible with the polar, high melting hard segments. The soft segments, which are formed from high molecular weight polyols, are mobile and are normally present in coiled formation, while the hard segments, which are formed from the isocyanate and chain extenders, are stiff and immobile. Because the hard segments are covalently coupled to the soft segments, they inhibit plastic flow of the polymer chains, thus creating elastomeric resiliency. Upon mechanical deformation, a portion of the soft segments are stressed by uncoiling, and the hard segments become aligned in the stress direction. This reorientation of the hard segments and consequent powerful hydrogen bonding contributes to high tensile strength, elongation, and tear resistance values.The choice of chain extender also determines flexural, heat, and chemical resistance properties. The most important chain extenders are ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO or BDO), 1,6-hexanediol, cyclohexane dimethanol and hydroquinone bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether (HQEE). All of these glycols form polyurethanes that phase separate well and form well defined hard segment domains, and are melt processable.

40|$|Pharmacists applied deprescribing, {{which is}} a process for the {{rational}} use of drugs, for 13 at-home patients. The standard used for the rational use of drugs was the ``Guidelines for Medical Treatment and Its Safety in the Elderly'' (the Guidelines). The results of the deprescribing were discussed with physicians to determine prescriptions. After the prescription change, {{activities of daily living}} (ADL) and QOL were assessed using the Barthel Index and SF- 36 v 2, respectively. Potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) were detected in 10 of the 13 patients (76. 9 ％). This detection rate is higher than previous PIM detection rates of 48. 4 ％ and 40. 4 ％ reported in prescriptions for home-care patients in Japan under the Beers and STOPP/START criteria.
