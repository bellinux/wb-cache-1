40|$|Earthworm coelomocytes {{have been}} used as {{effector}} cells against the human tumor target, K 562. To first assess the viability of effecters, incorporation of [H- 3]-thymidine was tested and was higher in autogeneic (<b>A</b> double <b>left</b> right arrow <b>A,</b> self) than in allogeneic (<b>A</b> double <b>left</b> right arrow B, nonself) coelomocytes, <b>A</b> double <b>left</b> right arrow <b>A</b> showed significantly greater numbers in S, G 2, or M phases than <b>A</b> double <b>left</b> right arrow B coelomocytes. When <b>A</b> double <b>left</b> right arrow <b>A</b> or <b>A</b> double <b>left</b> right arrow B were cultured, no significant cell killing occurred in either, as measured in a 4 -hr Cr- 51 release assay, <b>A</b> double <b>left</b> right arrow <b>A</b> but not <b>A</b> double <b>left</b> right arrow B killed K 562 target cells, Cytotoxicity was dependent upon membrane binding between small, electron-dense coelomocytes and targets; it was enhanced by adding PHA.
