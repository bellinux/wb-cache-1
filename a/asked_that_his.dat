5|$|Justice John McKinley's {{death in}} 1852 led to repeated, fruitless {{attempts}} by the president to fill the vacancy. The Senate took no action on the nomination of New Orleans attorney Edward A. Bradford. Fillmore's second choice, George Edmund Badger, <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> name be withdrawn. Senator-elect Judah P. Benjamin declined to serve. The nomination of William C. Micou, a New Orleans lawyer recommended by Benjamin, was not acted on by the Senate. The vacancy was finally filled after Fillmore's term, when President Franklin Pierce nominated John Archibald Campbell, who was confirmed by the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{occupation}} of Japan began soon after. On November 19 the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers issued {{an arrest warrant}} for Matsui on suspicion of war crimes. Matsui was ill with pneumonia {{at the time and}} so was given until March to recover. One of Matsui's final acts before going to prison was to ask his wife to adopt their longtime maid Hisae as their daughter. He also converted from Shintoism to Buddhism and <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> wife do the same. On March 6, 1946, he checked himself in to Sugamo Prison.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{returned}} to parliament in 1931, Bruce's service in the Lyons Government was brief. Instead he pursued an international career, accepting appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom in 1933. Bruce became an influential figure in British government circles and at the League of Nations, emerging as a tireless advocate for international cooperation on economic and social problems, especially those facing the developing world. Particularly passionate on improving global nutrition, Bruce {{was one of the}} key figures in the establishment of the Food and Agriculture Organization, serving as the first chairman of its governing council. He was the first Australian to sit in the House of Lords, as well as the first Chancellor of the Australian National University. Although his diplomatic career went largely unnoticed in Australia, he continued throughout his life in London to vociferously advocate for Australian interests (particularly during World War II) and <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> remains be returned to Canberra when he died in 1967.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Dudley {{assembled}} {{a force of}} 500 men at Ware, Hertfordshire to assist in his brother's campaign against Mary Tudor. Presumably arrested with him in East Anglia, he was imprisoned in the Tower on 25 July. Accused with his family of rebellion and high treason, Dudley stood trial at Westminster Hall on 19 August 1553. He pleaded guilty and only <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> jewels {{that were in the}} keeping of a wardrobe colleague should not be lost. On 21 August 1553, the day before John Dudley's execution, he appeared with him and other condemned persons at the Tower Chapel St. Peter ad Vincula to hear mass. His life was spared, and he was released in January 1555.|$|E
5|$|Lyons took on {{a number}} of causes in the 1910s and 1920s. He worked with Bishop David Greer and Rabbi Stephen Wise to expose {{conditions}} in New York's tenements, dissociated himself from Tammany Hall candidates, tried to secure a re-trial for Leo Frank, and opposed some of the views of Samuel Gompers. In 1912, Lyons was {{a founding member of the}} Eastern Council of Reform Rabbis, an organization of Reform rabbis from the Eastern United States that was created despite opposition from the Central Conference of Reform Rabbis. In 1919 he withdrew from the Brooklyn Victory Celebration Committee (celebrating the Allied victory in World War I) and <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> contributed funds be donated instead to the Red Cross; many committee members eventually resigned in protest over the overt politicization of the event, and its control by William Randolph Hearst.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{responded with}} a 25-page letter in which he tried to change Einstein's mind. To rule out the {{influence}} of convection he told Einstein {{that he had taken}} certain measures, including introducing a horizontal plate above the accumulator, wrapping it in a blanket, hanging it from the ceiling, burying it underground and placing it outside. He wrote that in all these circumstances the temperature difference remained, and was in fact more marked in the open air. Einstein did not respond to this or to Reich's future correspondence– Reich would write regularly reporting the results of his experiments– until Reich threatened three years later to publish their previous exchange. Einstein replied that he could not devote any further time to the matter and <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> name not be misused for advertising purposes. Reich believed that Einstein's change of heart was part of a conspiracy of some kind, perhaps related to the communists or prompted by the rumours that Reich was ill. Reich published the correspondence in 1953 as The Einstein Affair.|$|E
50|$|Beginning September 6, he was {{confined}} to his bed and on September 22, he resigned, appointing José Castro as his successor. On September 27, he wrote <b>his</b> last will, <b>asking</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> body be preserved and buried at Mission Santa Barbara.|$|R

5|$|The second {{version of}} the legend depicts Vithoba {{appearing}} before Pundalik as the five-year-old Bala Krishna (infant Krishna). This version is found in manuscripts of both Puranas, Prahlada Maharaj, and the poet-saints, notably Tukaram. The remaining {{version of the}} Pundalik legend appears in Sridhara and as a variant in the Padma Purana. Pundalik, a Brahmin {{madly in love with}} his wife, neglected his aged parents as a result. Later, on meeting sage Kukkuta, Pundalik underwent a transformation and devoted his life to the service of his aged parents. Meanwhile, Radha, the milkmaid-lover of Krishna, came to Dwarka, the kingdom of Krishna, and sat on his lap. Radha did not honour Rukmini, the chief queen of Krishna, nor did Krishna hold Radha accountable for the offence. Offended, Rukmini left Krishna and went to the forest of Dandivana near Pandharpur. Saddened by Rukmini's departure, Krishna searched for his queen and finally found her resting in Dandivana, near Pundalik's house. After some coaxing, Rukmini was pacified. Then Krishna visited Pundalik and found him serving his parents. Pundalik threw a brick outside for Krishna to rest on. Krishna stood on the brick and waited for Pundalik. After completing his services, Pundalik <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> Lord, in Vithoba form, remain on the brick with Rukmini, in Rakhumai form, and bless His devotees forever.|$|E

25|$|Rabbi Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller (1579–1654) of Kraków, Poland, <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> family {{henceforth}} {{celebrate a}} private Purim, marking {{the end of}} his many troubles, including having faced trumped-up charges. Since Purim is preceded by a fast day, the rabbi also directed his descendants to have a (private) fast day, the 5th day of Tamuz, marking one of his imprisonments (1629), this one lasting for 40 days.|$|E
25|$|On 8 April 1960, {{while he}} was driving to his laboratory, Laue’s car was struck in Berlin by a motorcyclist, who had {{received}} his license only two days earlier.

25|$|In {{the film}} El Peñón de las Ánimas, Félix starred {{opposite}} the popular Mexican actor and singer Jorge Negrete. María Félix and Jorge Negrete {{got off to}} a bad relationship during the filming because he had <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> girlfriend, the actress Gloria Marín, be given the lead role. For this reason the filming of the movie was difficult and led to a direct confrontation between Félix and Negrete. That confrontation helped to cement the reputation of Félix as a tough and arrogant woman.|$|E

25|$|Producer Lauren Shuler Donner had {{developed}} {{the film as}} far back as 1997. In 1999, Paul Hunter was attached to direct, followed by Tarsem Singh in 2001. Warner Bros. hoped Singh could begin filming in 2002 with Nicolas Cage attached to star in the lead role but Singh ended up dropping out, a move that inspired dueling lawsuits from Tarsem and Warners. Keanu Reeves became attached in 2002. Alan Moore, original creator of John Constantine, had been disappointed by the previous adaptations of his other comics From Hell and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, refused credit for the film and <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> royalties be distributed among the other creators.|$|E
25|$|After he had recuperated, Hagan <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> {{resignation}} be revoked.
