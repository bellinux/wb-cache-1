40|$|The Fermilab Main Injector (FMI) {{is a high}} {{intensity}} proton synchrotron which {{will be used to}} accelerate protons and antiprotons from 8. 9 GeV/c to 150 GeV/c. The natural chromaticities of the machine for the horizontal and the vertical Planes are {minus} 33. 6 and {minus} 33. 9 respectively. The {Delta}p/p of the beam at injection is about 0. 002. The chromaticity requirements of the FMI, are primarily decided by the {Delta}p/p = 0. 002 of the beam at injection. This limits the final chromaticity of the FMI to be {plus_minus} 5 units. To correct the chromaticity in the FMI two families of sextupole magnets will be installed in the lattice, one for each plane. A sextupole magnet suitable for the FMI needs has been designed and a number of them are being built.

Recent studies demonstrated previously unknown systematic beam position monitor (BPM) offset errors and produced accurate measurements of individual BPM offsets {{in the experiment}} interaction regions. Here we describe the algorithm used to collect and analyze data during the 2010 and early 2011 RHIC runs {{and the results of}} these measurements. BBA data has been collected over the past two runs for all three of the active experimental IRs at RHIC, updating results from the 2005 run which were taken with incorrectly installed offsets. The technique was successfully applied to expose a systematic misuse of the BPM survey offsets in the control system. This is likely to benefit polarized proton operations as polarization transmission through <b>acceleration</b> <b>ramps</b> depends on RMS orbit control in the arcs, but a quantitative understanding of its impact is still under active investigation. Data taking is ongoing as are refinements to the BBA technique aimed at reducing systematic errors and properly accounting for dispersive effects.

VsEPs are compound action potentials of the vestibular nerve and central relays that are elicited by linear <b>acceleration</b> <b>ramps</b> {{applied to the}} cranium. Rats, mice, guinea pigs, and gerbils were studied. In all species, response onset occurred within 1. 5 ms of the stimulus onset. Responses persisted during intense (116 dBSPL) wide-band (50 to 50 inverted question mark omitted inverted question mark 000 Hz) forward masking, whereas auditory responses to intense clicks (112 dBpeSPL) were eliminated under the same conditions. VsEPs remained after cochlear extirpation but were eliminated following bilateral labyrinthectomy. Responses included a series {{of positive and negative}} peaks that occurred within 8 ms of stimulus onset (range of means at + 6 dBre: 1. 0 g/ms: P 1 = 908 to 1062 micros, N 1 = 1342 to 1475 micros, P 2 = 1632 to 1952 micros, N 2 = 2038 to 2387 micros). Mean response amplitudes at + 6 dBre: 1. 0 g/ms ranged from 0. 14 to 0. 99 microV. VsEP input/output functions revealed latency slopes that varied across peaks and species ranging from - 19 to - 51 micros/dB. Amplitude-intensity slopes also varied ranging from 0. 04 to 0. 08 microV/dB for rats and mice. Latency values were comparable to those of birds although amplitudes were substantially smaller in mammals. VsEP threshold values were considerably higher in mammals compared to birds and ranged from - 8. 1 to - 10. 5 dBre 1. 0 g/ms across species.

In this effort, the Fermilab 8 GeV Booster synchrotron plays a critical role for at least the next two decades. Therefore, understanding the Booster in great detail is important as we continue to improve its performance. For example, it is important to know accurately the available RF power in the Booster by carrying out beam-based measurements in order to specify the needed upgrades to the Booster RF system. Since the Booster magnetic field is changing continuously measuring/calibrating the RF voltage is not a trivial task. Here, we present a beam based method for the RF voltage measurements. Data analysis is carried out using computer programs developed in Python and MATLAB.

40|$|The Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) is {{designed}} to provide sufficient availability of accuracy, continuity, and integrity to satisfy the demanding requirements of aircraft precision approach, landing, and surface navigation under poor visibility conditions. The use of the GPS constellation alone is not practical because the satellites do not provide enough ranging accuracy on their own and there are too few of them to provide 99. 9 % availability. To enhance GPS positioning accuracy, the GBAS ground facility (GGF) generates differential corrections, based on the surveyed location of reference receivers, and broadcasts the correction message to an approaching airplane using a VHF data link. To ensure navigation integrity, the GGF is also responsible for detection and removal of anomalies such as ground-based or space-based system failures. Thus, the broadcast data also contain alerts on system failures and integrity parameters which reflect the quality of the correction. Based on the GBAS messages, the users determine which satellites can be used safely and correct their ranging measurements. GBAS ground facility runs different monitor to detect and isolate failures on measurements and satellite orbits. Once a failure is detected, the associated measurement, satellite and/or receiver is excluded to guarantee the integrity of the differential corrections.

40|$|Since {{the first}} {{start-up}} of HERA in 1992, a transverse coherent instability has appeared {{from time to}} time {{at the beginning of the}} <b>acceleration</b> <b>ramp.</b> In this process, the emittance is blown up and the beam is partially or completely lost. Although the instability was found to be of the head-tail type, and the chromaticity and linear coupling between the transverse planes was recognized as essential for the instability to occur, the driving mechanism was never clarified. An explanation of the phenomenon is presented in this paper using the coupled Landau damping theory. It is predicted that a too strong coupling can be detrimental since it may shift the coherent tune outside the incoherent spectrum and thus prevent Landau damping. Due to these features, the name "coupled head-tail instability" is suggested for this instability in the HERA proton ring...|$|E
40|$|Project {{conducted}} {{in cooperation with}} the Federal Highway Administration. Freeway ramp design speed criteria contained in current American Association of Highway and Transportation Official (AASHTO) and Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) design policies have been traced through roughly 50 years of technical literature. The evolution of design speed criteria has been documented and technical rational leading to periodic changes has been included. TxDOT ramp design speed criteria are, essentially, the AASHTO criteria. The origins of driver acceleration and deceleration rates, which are built into the AASHTO criteria, are experimental studies performed during the late thirties. Several studies have raised questions about the appropriateness of the AASHTO minimum allowable ramp design speed, which is 50 percent of the freeway design speed. Questions have also been raised about the adequacy of high-speed ramp lengths designed by AASHTO criteria. A conceptual data collection plan has been designed to provide information that will answer questions regarding current criteria. Additionally, a nationwide survey of ramp design agencies indicates that (1) there is a variety of different design policies; (2) most designers have concern for entrance ramps, as opposed to exits; and (3) safety is the most commonly used evaluation measure. 17.

40|$|Two {{parallel}} tune measurement {{systems are}} installed at GSI SIS- 18 based on diﬀerent principles. The ﬁrst {{is called the}} Tune, Orbit and POSition measurement system TOPOS. Its working principle involves direct digitization of BPM signals at 125 MSa/s, which is used for online bunch-by-bunch position calculation in FPGAs. In {{the course of this}} work, position calculation algorithms were developed and studied for real time implementation in the TOPOS FPGAs. The regression ﬁt algorithm is found to be more eﬃcient and robust in comparison to previously used weighted mean algorithm with the baseline restoration procedure. The second system is the Baseband Tune measurement system referred to as BBQ system. The operational principle of this system was conceived at the CERN Beam Instrumentation group and is based on direct diode detection. In the framework of this work, this system was optimized and brought into operation at GSI SIS- 18. Front-end data from both systems are used to calculate the tune spectrum every 250 − 5000 beam revolutions or turns within SIS- 18 based on the resolution requirement and the mode of operation. Advanced non-parametric spectrum estimation method like amplitude Capon estimator is compared to the conventional DFT based methods in terms of resolving power and computational requirements for the calculated spectrum. Further the TOPOS and BBQ systems are compared and characterized in terms of sensitivity, reliability and operational usage. The results from both systems are found to be consistent with each other and have their favoured regimes of operation. The eﬀects on tune spectra obtained from both systems were studied with diﬀerent types of excitations with excitation power levels up to 6 mW/Hz. These systems in association with other beam diagnostic devices at SIS- 18 were used to conduct extensive experiments to understand the eﬀect of high intensity beams on the tune spectrum. These careful measurements recorded all the relevant beam parameters,thus leaving out no “free parameters”. Several important results were established in course of these experiments. Coherent tune shifts in dependence of intensity gave direct measurements of transverse machine impedances. The high resolution tune spectrum allowed identiﬁcation of higher order head-tail modes. The relative spectral positions of these head-tail modes when compared with the analytical theory based on the “square well airbag model” gave a direct measurement of the incoherent tune spread in bunched beams. The measurements agreed well with the perturbative treatment applied in the theory only for space charge parameter in the range qsc < 4 after which signiﬁcant deviations from the theoretical predictions occur. These deviations were understood by using self-consistent simulations and are attributed to the unaccounted role of the pipe impedances in Landau damping of head-tail modes. A novel chromaticity measurement method is demonstrated using temporal separation of each head-tail mode using chirp excitation. Other applications of the parallel tune measurement systems such as linear betatron coupling measurements or tune measurements during <b>acceleration</b> <b>ramps</b> are demonstrated.
