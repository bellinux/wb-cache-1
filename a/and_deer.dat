5|$|American beech (Fagus grandifolia), used by {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas as food. Several tribes sought stores of beech nuts gathered by chipmunks <b>and</b> <b>deer</b> mice, thus obtaining nuts that were already sorted and shelled.|$|E

5|$|An Ontario Parks visitor's permit is not {{required}} to drive through Algonquin Park. However, one is required for the use of any trails, campgrounds, the Visitor Centre, or similar facilities within the park boundary. Moose <b>and</b> <b>deer</b> are very common through Algonquin, especially at night and in the morning, and present a major driving hazard.|$|E
5|$|Mycobacteria infect many {{different}} animals, including birds, rodents, and reptiles. The subspecies Mycobacterium tuberculosis, though, is rarely present in wild animals. An effort to eradicate bovine tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis from the cattle <b>and</b> <b>deer</b> herds of New Zealand {{has been relatively}} successful. Efforts in Great Britain have been less successful.|$|E
5|$|The fruits {{are also}} eaten by various wild birds and mammals, {{including}} pronghorn, desert bighorn sheep, <b>and</b> <b>deer.</b> The thorny plants provide escape for cover for many small animals.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the most}} serious disease {{problems}} are fireblight, a bacterial disease; and Gymnosporangium rust, and black spot, two fungal diseases. Codling moths and apple maggots are two other pests which affect apple trees. Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice <b>and</b> <b>deer,</b> which feed on the soft bark of the trees, especially in winter.|$|E
5|$|Animals such as horses <b>and</b> <b>deer</b> {{are among}} the {{earliest}} subjects of art, being found in the Upper Paleolithic cave paintings such as at Lascaux. Major artists such as Albrecht Dürer, George Stubbs and Edwin Landseer {{are known for their}} portraits of animals. Animals further play a wide variety of roles in literature, film, mythology, and religion.|$|E
5|$|Horses are {{odd-toed}} ungulates, {{or members}} of the order Perissodactyla. This order also includes the extant species of rhinos and tapirs, and many extinct families and species. Members of this order walk on either one toe (like horses) or three toes (like rhinos and tapirs). This {{is in contrast to}} even-toed ungulates, members of the order Artiodactyla, which walk on cloven hooves, or two toes. This order includes many species associated with livestock, such as sheep, goats, pigs, cows and camels, as well as species of giraffes, antelopes <b>and</b> <b>deer.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the lateral dispersion (by invertebrates <b>and</b> <b>deer)</b> there is also importance {{in the fact that}} burial (vertical dispersion) by ants (or other vectors) increases the survival of new plants by two mechanisms. First, vertical dispersion ensures sufficient depth to preserve the seeds through their dormancy (Trillium seeds are normally dormant for their first year). Second, vertical dispersion ensures adequate anchorage of the rhizomes. This is particularly important for young plants because their small rhizomes, with few & short roots, are easily dislodged (e.g. frost heaveal and other erosion factors) and desiccated.|$|E
5|$|Liliaceae {{are subject}} {{to a wide variety}} of {{diseases}} and pests, including insects, such as thrips, aphids, beetles and flies. Also fungi, viruses and vertebrate animals such as mice <b>and</b> <b>deer.</b> An important horticultural and garden pest is the scarlet lily beetle (Japanese red lily beetle, Lilioceris lilii) and other Lilioceris species which attack Fritillaria and Lilium. Lilium species may be food plants for the Cosmia trapezina moth. A major pest of Tulips is the fungus, Botrytis tulipae.|$|E
5|$|Maya {{textiles}} {{are very}} poorly {{represented in the}} archaeological record, although by comparison with other pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Aztecs and the Andean region, {{it is likely that}} they were high-value items. A few scraps of textile have been recovered by archaeologists, but the best evidence for textile art is where they are represented in other media, such as painted murals or ceramics. Such secondary representations show the elite of the Maya court adorned with sumptuous cloths, generally these would have been cotton, but jaguar pelts <b>and</b> <b>deer</b> hides are also shown.|$|E

5|$|Other discoveries include various {{plants and}} animals that {{are thought to have}} formed part of their diet, e.g. wild banana, breadfruit, and fish bones, and {{articles}} that were used as personal ornaments such as shell pendants and shark beads, indicating occasional contact with the coast around 40km away. It is also likely that Balangoda Man visited Horton Plains in the central highlands of Sri Lanka during their annual cycle of gathering foods such as cereals, and hunting animals, most likely wild cattle, sambur, <b>and</b> <b>deer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pitfour, an Episcopalian, {{had a small}} Qualified Chapel {{built on}} the estate at Waulkmill in 1766. This large plain {{building}} could accommodate up to 500 parishioners. Saplinbrae, a house that was initially used as a coaching inn after its construction on Pitfour's instruction in 1756, {{was used as the}} minister's manse. Douglas firs were planted near Saplinbrae <b>and</b> <b>Deer</b> Abbey from seed sent from Canada by Pitfour's brother-in-law, General James Murray.|$|E
5|$|The Old Bullock/Long Ridge track {{runs along}} Long Ridge towards Eagle on the Hill. Much {{of the housing}} and {{residential}} properties are on the North-West side of the Mount, as to enable views over Adelaide. A few small settlements and paddocks with livestock (sheep, goats <b>and</b> <b>deer)</b> are still present on the slopes between the South Eastern Freeway and the Long Ridge Track.|$|E

5|$|The valley {{also has}} {{a wide variety of}} small mammals with larger species {{including}} Eurasian badger (Meles meles) <b>and</b> <b>deer</b> (Cervidae). The valley is home to fifteen of the sixteen bats found in England including a roost, at Compton Martin Ochre Mine, for greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). A rare and endangered species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in Annex II of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive.|$|E
5|$|Though the bobcat prefers {{rabbits and}} hares, it hunts insects, chickens, geese and other birds, small rodents, <b>and</b> <b>deer.</b> Prey {{selection}} depends on location and habitat, season, and abundance. Like most cats, the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary, although with some overlap in home ranges. It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries, including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces. The bobcat breeds from winter into spring {{and has a}} gestation period of about two months.|$|E
5|$|Descriptions {{from early}} explorers and {{settlers}} give {{some idea of}} what the Pine Creek Gorge was like before it was clearcut. The forest was up to 85percent hemlock and white pine, with the rest hardwoods. Many animal species that are now vanished inhabited the area. A herd of 12,000American bison migrated along the West Branch Susquehanna River in 1773. Pine Creek was home to large predators such as wolves, lynx, wolverines, panthers, fishers, foxes and bobcats, all save the last three now locally extinct. The area had herds of elk <b>and</b> <b>deer,</b> and large numbers of black bears, river otters, and beavers. In 1794, two of the earliest white explorers to travel up Pine Creek found so many rattlesnakes on its banks that they had to sleep in their canoe. Further upstream, insects forced them to do the same.|$|E
