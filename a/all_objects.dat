5|$|Newton's Third Law of Motion {{requires}} that <b>all</b> <b>objects</b> exerting torques themselves experience equal and opposite torques, and therefore also directly implies {{the conservation of}} angular momentum for closed systems that experience rotations and revolutions through the action of internal torques.|$|E
5|$|Sir Isaac Newton {{described}} {{the motion of}} <b>all</b> <b>objects</b> using the concepts of inertia and force, {{and in doing so}} he found they obey certain conservation laws. In 1687, Newton published his thesis Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica. In this work Newton set out three laws of motion that to this day are the way forces are described in physics.|$|E
5|$|Panpsychism is {{the view}} that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, <b>all</b> <b>objects</b> have a unified center of {{experience}} or point of view. Superficially, {{it seems to be}} a form of property dualism, since it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say mechanical behaviour is derived from primitive mentality of atoms and molecules—as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to the presence or absence of complex structure in a compound object. So long as the reduction of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not a (strong) form of property dualism; otherwise it is.|$|E

5|$|Routine {{observations}} {{were taken by}} the team on October 21, 2003, using the 1.2m Samuel Oschin Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory, California, but the image of Eris was not discovered at that point due to its very slow motion across the sky: The team's automatic image-searching software excluded <b>all</b> <b>objects</b> moving at less than 1.5arcseconds per hour {{to reduce the number}} of false positives returned. When Sedna was discovered, it was moving at 1.75arcsec/h, and in light of that the team reanalyzed their old data with a lower limit on the angular motion, sorting through the previously excluded images by eye. In January 2005, the re-analysis revealed Eris's slow motion against the background stars.|$|E
5|$|The {{combat system}} in Dawn of Mana {{is called the}} Mono system, based around the Havok physic engine. Almost <b>all</b> <b>objects</b> in the game, {{including}} enemies, are moveable, allowing Keldric to throw objects at enemies, or even throw other monsters. Keldric can either throw objects in the direction he is facing, or can target a specific enemy or object to aim at them. When something is thrown near an enemy, they Panic, resulting in a counter over their head that counts down to zero to end the Panic. While panicked, enemies take more damage from attacks and spells. Defeating enemies when they are panicked gives the player two types of medals, which can either boost the player's health and attack damage, or mana and magic damage. Throwing multiple objects can Panic enemies more; when the Panic meter is greater than 99 the player can receive better medals. Defeating enemies also grants experience points, which raise Keldric and Faye's level up {{to a maximum of}} four, granting higher health, mana, and damage, and granting new spells and attacks. In addition to being throwable, many objects in the game are also destructible.|$|E
25|$|M9, Atomicity: <b>All</b> <b>objects</b> {{are either}} atoms or fusions of atoms.|$|E
50|$|This is {{different}} from what happens in non-DOM languages, where <b>all</b> direct <b>objects</b> are uniformly marked in the same way; for instance, a language could mark <b>all</b> direct <b>objects</b> with an accusative ending (as in Quechua); other language could leave <b>all</b> direct <b>objects</b> without overt marker (as in English).|$|R

25|$|J.P. was a complex, {{intelligent}} and highly creative individual, {{as well as}} a devoted family man, an artist and an accomplished musician, and was well known for his fondness for collecting things. Anything and everything, wherever he went, he collected stuff. His obsession with collecting sprang from his belief that <b>all</b> <b>objects</b> were art, <b>all</b> <b>objects</b> have beauty and were worthy of standing alone as art or of disassembling and re-working to enhance the art inherent within. He had been inspired and influenced by his beatnik artist friends, and by the revolution in the art world earlier last century that produced the Dada/Anti-Art movement and the found-art philosophy of Marcel Duchamp.|$|E

25|$|For {{these ideas}} to apply, {{everything}} {{observed in the}} frame has {{to be subject to}} a base-line, common acceleration shared by the frame itself. That situation would apply, for example, to the elevator example, where <b>all</b> <b>objects</b> are subject to the same gravitational acceleration, and the elevator itself accelerates at the same rate.|$|E

25|$|C is {{an exact}} {{subcategory}} {{if it is}} itself an exact category and the inclusion I is an exact functor. This occurs {{if and only if}} C is closed under pull-backs of epimorphisms and push-outs of monomorphisms. The exact sequences in C are thus the exact sequences in A for which <b>all</b> <b>objects</b> lie in C.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} step, a sorted array {{is created by}} {{repeatedly}} removing the largest element from the heap (the root of the heap), and inserting it into the array. The heap is updated after each removal to maintain the heap property. Once <b>all</b> <b>objects</b> {{have been removed from}} the heap, the result is a sorted array.|$|E
25|$|A {{category}} C {{is called}} small if both ob(C) and hom(C) are actually sets and not proper classes, and large otherwise. A locally small category is a category such that for <b>all</b> <b>objects</b> a and b, the hom-class hom(a, b) is a set, called a homset. Many important categories in mathematics (such as {{the category of}} sets), although not small, are at least locally small.|$|E
