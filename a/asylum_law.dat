2500|$|In 1999 Schäuble {{initiated}} a CDU/CSU petition {{campaign against the}} reform of German citizenship law under the slogan [...] "Integration: yes— double citizenship: no". In response to anti-immigrant rallies in the eastern city of Dresden in late 2014, Schäuble said that immigration is good for Germany and politicians must explain better that everyone stands to gain from it; at the time, the number of asylum seekers in Germany, many from Syria, had more than doubled within a year to around 200,000, and net immigration was at its highest level in two decades. [...] "Just as we used millions of refugees and expellees after World War Two to rebuild.. so we need immigration today," [...] Schäuble told Bild {{when asked about the}} popularity of anti-immigration policies. Also, he held that [...] "people are right to fear Islamist terrorism. But not Islam."

2500|$|The term [...] "well-founded fear" [...] has no precise {{definition}} in <b>asylum</b> <b>law.</b> In INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, , the Supreme Court avoided attaching {{a consistent}} definition to the term, preferring instead {{to allow the}} meaning to evolve through case-by-case determinations. However, in Cardoza-Fonseca, the Court did establish that a [...] "well-founded" [...] fear is something less than a [...] "clear probability" [...] that the applicant will suffer persecution. Three years earlier, in INS v. Stevic, , the Court held that the clear probability standard applies in proceedings seeking withholding of deportation (now officially referred to as 'withholding of removal' or 'restriction on removal'), because in such cases the Attorney General must allow the applicant {{to remain in the}} United States. With respect to asylum, because Congress employed different language in the asylum statute and incorporated the refugee definition from the international Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the Court in Cardoza-Fonseca reasoned that the standard for showing a well-founded fear of persecution must necessarily be lower.|$|E

30|$|In all {{the case}} studies, the 2015 “European Refugee Crisis” has stimulated the {{tightening}} of national <b>asylum</b> <b>laws</b> and local practices {{with regard to}} (but not limited to) accommodation addressing longer durations of obligatory stays in the camps (at least during the asylum application process), the enlargement and legal securing of mass accommodation, the opportunities to introduce remote locations for accommodation centers, detention practices during the application process, and legal exemptions for development, standards, and capacities. The current contribution illustrates the process of campization by parsing the causal relationship between {{the increase in the}} number of refugees, the introduction of a wave of new <b>asylum</b> <b>laws,</b> and reception conditions and the establishment of camp-like socio-spatial structures of accommodation. It argues that the objective of states and laws to produce stigmatized and excluded subjects is deeply realized in the space of campizated refugee accommodation.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} several decades, many people, fleeing from {{disasters}} or political threats, have applied for asylum in the European countries. Council Directive 2003 / 9 /EC, laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum-seekers, {{as well as several}} other directives, have been developed in the EU in order to ensure fair treatment of the asylum-seekers in all the European countries. However, there are huge differences in the national <b>asylum</b> <b>laws</b> of countries and consequently, the way they treat the asylum-seekers. In this research, the national <b>asylum</b> <b>laws</b> of Germany and the Netherlands are studied and compared, showing that though following the Council Directive, fair or equal treatment of asylum-seekers cannot be guaranteed. In the Netherlands asylum-seekers are granted with a great extent of benefits while in Germany, they are greatly discriminated against. Based on the Social Determinants of Health Model, developed by Dahlgren and Whitehead in 1991, the hypothesis is that the asylum seekers in the Netherlands enjoy better health status than the ones in Germany, because based on the Dutch <b>asylum</b> <b>laws,</b> they have better living and working conditions. In order to confirm or negate this hypothesis, a meta-study of available literature on the health status of asylum-seekers has been done. However, the hypothesis could not be confirmed/ negated due to extreme lack of availability of data in this area. By discussing the relationship between life conditions and health of individuals, reviewing current legal instruments regulating asylum in the EU and analyzing the available data on the health status of asylum-seekers, this paper draws the attention to the importance of data and research on these topics and the need for development of practices for collection of such information. Availability of such information can affect future decision and policy makings regarding asylum-seekers and their health and might result in comprehensive reformations in the current national or international legal instruments...|$|R
