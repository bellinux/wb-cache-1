5|$|On 16 April, Fantala turned {{more to the}} west-northward {{toward the}} {{southern}} islands of the Seychelles, steered by a strengthening ridge near Madagascar. Intensification resumed by 12:00UTC the following day, with the JTWC estimating 1-minute sustained winds of 270km/h (165mph), classifying Fantala as a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Around 15:00UTC, the cyclone moved through the Farquhar Group of the Seychelles, and its eyewall moved over several small islands. At 18:00UTC on 17 April, the MFR upgraded Fantala to <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> tropical cyclone; based on a Dvorak T-number of T7.5, the satellite-derived wind estimate was 10-minute sustained winds of 250km/h (155mph), along with an estimated barometric pressure of 910mbar (hPa; 26.87inHg). However, in the best track for Fantala, the MFR concluded that Fantala had been <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> tropical cyclone 6 hours earlier as well, with 10-minute sustained winds of 220km/h (140mph), and that its minimum central pressure of 910mbar (hPa; 26.87inHg) had occurred 12 hours later, at 06:00UTC the following day. The JTWC also estimated peak 1minute winds of 285km/h (180mph).|$|E
5|$|Should the named storm intensify {{further and}} reach winds speeds of 48knots (89km/h, 55mph), {{then it will}} be {{classified}} as a severe tropical storm. A severe tropical storm is designated as a tropical cyclone when it reaches wind speeds of 64knots (118km/h, 74mph). Should a tropical cyclone intensify further and reach wind speeds of 90knots (166km/h, 103mph), it will be classified as an intense tropical cyclone. <b>A</b> <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> tropical cyclone is the highest category on the South-West Indian Ocean Tropical Cyclone scale, and has winds of over 115knots (212km/h, 132mph).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ramon was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> Pacific {{hurricane}} {{that generated}} heavy rains in Southern California. The 19th named storm and final hurricane of the above-average 1987 Pacific hurricane season, Ramon originated from a tropical disturbance that formed in early October. On October5, {{a tropical storm}} had developed several hundred miles southwest of Manzanillo, bypassing the tropical depression stage. Tropical Storm Ramon turned to the west-northwest after initially moving west. It intensified into a hurricane on October7. Two days later, Hurricane Ramon peaked in intensity with winds of 140mph (220km/h). After peaking, Ramon turned to the northwest and rapidly weakened over cooler waters. It weakened into a tropical storm on October11 and a depression on October12. Ramon dissipated shortly thereafter. While at sea, Ramon brought light rainfall to the Baja California Peninsula. The remnants of Hurricane Ramon produced heavy rainfall that caused flooding in California, indirectly contributing to five traffic-related fatalities. Rainfall was reported as far inland as Utah.|$|E

5|$|Hondo {{continued}} to quickly strengthen, becoming a tropical cyclone, {{the equivalent of}} a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, that same day. After maintaining its through the early hours of February6, a pinhole eye began to develop, signifying that Hondo was beginning to undergo rapid intensification. During this intensification phase, the storm became nearly stationary again due to a weakness in the ridge which was previously steering the cyclone towards the east. Later that day, Hondo was upgraded to an intense tropical cyclone with winds of 175km/h (110mph 10-minute winds). After becoming an intense tropical cyclone, wind shear began to increase, causing the eye to become slightly disorganized, temporarily slowed the intensification. Later in the day, the eye became better defined, allowing Hondo to intensify further. Operationally, Hondo was upgraded to <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> tropical cyclone with winds of 220km/h (140mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 906hPa (mbar). However, after reanalysis, it was found that Hondo never intensified beyond intense tropical cyclone status and winds peaked at 215km/h (130mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 915hPa (mbar).|$|E
5|$|The first {{storm of}} the season, Hurricane Adolph became the southernmost-forming east Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone on record after forming at a latitude of 7.1°N. After a slow start, activity {{picked up in}} July, when Hurricane Gil moved through the Hawaiian Islands, resulting in moderate damage. In early August, Hurricane Ismael was responsible for three deaths and $19million (1983USD) in damage. During early September, Hurricanes Kiko and Lorena brought significant damage and seven deaths to southern Mexico. About a month later, Tropical Storm Octave became the worst tropical cyclone on record to affect Arizona. Octave killed 15 people, and caused $500million in damage to Arizona and $12.5million to New Mexico. Later in October, Hurricane Tico was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> hurricane {{at the time of}} its landfall and thus left 25,000homeless. Damage throughout the country was estimated at $200million while 135deaths were reported in Mexico. Although most of its impact occurred in Mexico, Tico's remnants brought significant flooding in the Central United States, resulting in six deaths and $42million in damage. A few days later, Hurricane Raymond posed a threat to Hawaii, but did little actual damage. The final storm of the season, Hurricane Winnie, was a rare December cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Hudah was a {{powerful}} and destructive tropical cyclone that affected Southeast Africa in April2000. It was the last {{in a series of}} three cyclones that impacted Madagascar during the year. Hudah first developed as a disturbance embedded within the monsoon trough on March22, within the Australian region cyclone basin. Moving westward {{as the result of a}} strong subtropical ridge to its south, the storm quickly intensified, and reached Category2 cyclone intensity on March25 before entering the Southwest Indian cyclone basin. For various reasons that remain unknown, the cyclone was only designated a name by the time it had crossed into the area of responsibility of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Réunion. Nonetheless, Météo-France (MFR) assigned the name Hudah to the cyclone. An eye formed, and the storm intensified into a tropical cyclone on March27 well to the southeast of Diego Garcia. On April1, the MFR upgraded it to <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> tropical cyclone, estimating peak 10minute winds of 225km/h (140mph). By contrast, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated 1minute winds of 235km/h (145mph). Cyclone Hudah maintained peak winds until making landfall just southeast of Antalaha, Madagascar on April2. It weakened greatly over land, but re-attained tropical cyclone status on April5 after moving over the Mozambique Channel. Hudah reached 10minute winds of 160km/h (100mph) by the time it made landfall on Mozambique near Pebane, Mozambique, on April8, and dissipated by the next day.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the issue of substitution between formal and informal care in Britain between 1985 and 2000. This period provides the conditions for a ‘natural experiment’ in social policy. During the late 1980 s/early 1990 s, there was an increase in long-stay residential care for older people, which came to an end around the mid- 1990 s. The paper examines whether this increase in formal services led to a decline in informal care, and whether this was subsequently reversed. The focus is on provision of intense informal care by adult children to their older parents, trends in which are identified using General Household Survey data. The paper shows that there was a decline in provision of <b>intense</b> and <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> co-resident care for older parents between 1985 and 1995, which came to an end in the mid- 1990 s. These trends in intergenerational care were negatively related to changes in long-stay residential care. In particular, controlling for age and disability, there was evidence of substitution between nursing home/hospital care and <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> co-resident care for older parents. A key policy implication is that <b>an</b> expansion of <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> formal services for older people could bring about <b>a</b> decline in <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> intergenerational care. The paper relates these findings to the current debate on reform of the long-term care system in England...|$|R

25|$|Hail {{forms in}} <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> updraft in a {{supercell}} or a multicellular thunderstorm. As for tornadoes, BWER detection and a tilted updraft {{are indicative of}} that updraft but {{does not lead to}} predict hail. The presence of a hail spike in the reflectivity pattern is an important clue. It is an area of weak reflectivity extending away from the radar immediately behind a thunderstorm with hail. It is caused by radiation from the radar bouncing from hailstone to hailstone or the ground before being reflected back to the radar. The time delay between the backscattered radiation from the storm and the one with multiple paths causes the reflectivity from the hail to appear to come from a farther range than the actual storm. However, this artefact is visible mostly for extremely large hail.|$|E
25|$|Century-old vines {{still exist}} in many {{regional}} vineyards {{and allow for}} the production of long-aging, robust red wines with intense fruit and enhanced tannic content. The best known appellation is the DOCG (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita) Barbera d'Asti in the Piedmont region: the highest-quality Nizza DOCG wines are produced within a sub-zone of the Barbera d'Asti production area. When young, the wines offer <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> aroma of fresh red cherries and blackberries. In the lightest versions notes of cherries, raspberries and blueberries and with notes of blackberry and black cherries in wines made of more ripe grapes. Many producers employ the use of toasted (seared over a fire) oak barrels, which provides for increased complexity, aging potential, and hints of vanilla notes. The lightest versions are generally known for flavors and aromas of fresh fruit and dried fruits, and are not recommended for cellaring. Wines with better balance between acid and fruit, often with the addition of oak and having a high alcohol content are more capable of cellaring; these wines often result from reduced-yield viticultural methods.|$|E
