2500|$|The {{disposal}} of laboratory ethidium bromide remains a controversial subject. [...] Ethidium bromide can be degraded chemically, or collected and incinerated.

[...] A common practice is to treat ethidium bromide with sodium hypochlorite (bleach) before disposal. [...] According to Lunn and Sansone, chemical degradation using bleach yields compounds which are mutagenic by the <b>Ames</b> <b>test.</b> [...] Data are lacking on the mutagenic effects of degradation products. [...] Lunn and Sansone describe more effective methods for degradation. Elsewhere, ethidium bromide removal from solutions with activated charcoal or amberlite ion exchange resin is recommended.

2500|$|There are {{alternatives}} to ethidium bromide which are advertised as being less dangerous and having better performance. For example, several SYBR-based dyes {{are used by}} some researchers {{and there are other}} emerging stains such as Novel Juice. [...] SYBR dyes are less mutagenic than EtBr by the <b>Ames</b> <b>test</b> with liver extract. However, SYBR Green I was actually found to be more mutagenic than EtBr to the bacterial cells exposed to UV (which is used to visualize either dye). This may be the case for other [...] "safer" [...] dyes, but whilst mutagenic and toxicity details are available [...] these have not been published in peer reviewed journals. [...] MSDS for SYBR Safe reports a LD50 for rats of >5g/kg, which is higher than that of EtBr (1.5g/kg), but both are many orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations used in molecular biology. [...] Also, many alternative dyes are suspended in DMSO, which has health implications of its own including increased skin absorption of organic compounds. Despite the performance advantage of using SYBR dyes instead of EtBr for staining purposes, many researchers still prefer EtBr since it is considerably less expensive.|$|E
2500|$|Ethidium bromide {{is thought}} {{to act as a}} mutagen because it intercalates double {{stranded}} DNA (i.e., inserts itself between the strands), deforming the DNA. This could affect DNA biological processes, like DNA replication and transcription. [...] Ethidium bromide {{has been shown to be}} mutagenic to bacteria via the <b>Ames</b> <b>test,</b> but only after treatment with liver homogenate, which simulates the metabolic breakdown of the molecule being tested. The lack of detected mutagenicity without liver homogenate indicates that ethidium bromide is not directly mutagenic, but that its metabolites are. [...] The identity of these mutagenic metabolites are unknown. [...] The National Toxicology Program states it is nonmutagenic in rats and mice. These conclusions are supported by a subchronic carcinogenicity study in mice, whereby no mutagenic effects were detected. Ethidium bromide (Homidium brand) use in animals to treat trypanosome infection suggests that toxicity and mutagenicity are not high. [...] Studies have been conducted in animals to evaluate EtBr as a potential antitumorigenic chemotherapeutic agent. Its chemotherapeutic use is due to its toxicity to mitochondria. A more recent study shows that EtBr acts as a topoisomerase I poison, just like several anticancer drugs used in humans. [...] The above studies do not support the commonly held idea that ethidium bromide is a potent mutagen in humans, but they do indicate that it can be toxic at high concentrations.|$|E

Three different variables were investigated: (i) the effect of temperature; (ii) the effect of the stage of larval development; and (iii) the effect of varying or continuous exposure concentrations.

Secondly, it may allow the detection of genotoxic chemicals which yield false negatives in the <b>Ames</b> <b>test</b> (such as estradiol, a compound of growing concern).

High-protein diets lead to increases in N-nitroso compounds in faecal water and greater DNA damage as measured by the Comet assay, for example.

The implication of estrogen in breast cancer has been associated mostly with the estrogen receptors that mediate cell proliferation. Evidence also exists to support the hypothesis of a direct role of estrogens as tumor initiators. However, the role of estrogen genotoxicity in breast cancer is still questionable. In this study the genotoxic activity of catecholestrogens and 16 alpha-hydroxy estrone has been investigated by performing Salmonella strain TA 98 and TA 100 <b>Ames</b> <b>tests,</b> sister chromatide exchange assays (SCE) and micronucleus assays on human peripheral lymphocytes (CBMN and ARA/CBMN).
