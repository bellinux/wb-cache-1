On 30 June, the King ordered England's serfs to return to their previous conditions of service, and on 2 July the royal charters signed under duress during the rising were formally revoked. Parliament met in November to discuss the events of the year <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> respond to their challenges. The revolt was blamed on the misconduct of royal officials, who, it was argued, had been excessively greedy and overbearing. The Commons stood behind the existing labour laws, but requested changes in the royal council, which Richard granted. Richard also granted general pardons to those who had executed rebels without due process, to all men who had remained loyal, and to all those who had rebelled– {{with the exception of the}} men of Bury St Edmunds, any men who had been involved in the killing of the King's advisers, and those who were still on the run from prison.|$|E

Christine Brandel, writing for {{entertainment}} website PopMatters, particularly praised the episode's [...] "beautifully done" [...] dialogue, saying that [...] "it feels authentic in its phrasing, even during the more bizarre (and hilarious) court scenes". Owen, similarly, said [...] "the dialogue was also frequently hilarious, with Shearsmith and Pemberton having a fine ear for the rhythms of Olde English <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> have characters deadpan their way through some ridiculous sentences." [...] Hawksley praised Warner's [...] "effortlessly batty" [...] performance as Sir Andrew Pike, and claimed that Sheen [...] "brought an unsettling complexity" [...] to the title character. Gerard Gilbert, of The Independent, claimed Warner was clearly [...] "having a ball" [...] as Pike, and Wright (The Guardian) said [...] "Warner quite brilliantly makes the most of every line he's given".

500|$|... p.In 1980, {{according}} to David Ost, [...] "intellectuals first proclaimed an inseparable connection {{of labor and}} democracy, thus establishing the claim they would {{spend most of the}} rest of the decade trying to dismantle". Later in the 1980s and in the 1990s workers will be defined by intellectuals as irrational, misguided and even dangerous, because of their [...] "illegitimate" [...] opposition to the [...] "necessary", [...] "correct" [...] and [...] "rational" [...] economic policies, pursued especially by the new post-1989 liberal establishment and couched by it in the absolute language of science, not in relative terms of a political debate. Ost concludes that the liberals [...] "got it wrong" [...] and made [...] "their fatal error": they drove the critics toward an ideological and intolerant Right. The abandonment, rejection and exclusion would thus push many workers, labor activists and others into right-wing populism and religious nationalism (the marginalized in 1989 but later resurgent illiberal camp), while the liberal elite would pay with a steady erosion of its authority. The liberals' approach revealed [...] "a fundamental misunderstanding of what democracy is <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> consolidate it". In the end, the liberals misguided in their belief that [...] "liberal democracy could be grounded solely in private property" [...] ignored in the post-1989 discourse not only the material, but also the symbolic and emotional levels. They adopted a hostile attitude toward their labor base and had thus [...] "squandered their moral and political authority", making it possible for the politically illiberal populist Right to fill the resulting societal vacuum and flourish (by proffering only fictitious enemies and symbolic appeasement).|$|E

Right from the start, the new applicants vastly exceeded the number of openings as the first class of the Law College numbered only 100, but 1, 210 students had applied. The legal system that the students were trained was closely modeled after the Japanese legal system, which in its turn was modeled after the French legal system, but there were a number of particularities unique to Manchukuo. Law students were trained to write essays on such topics as the [...] "theory of the harmony of the five races [...] ", the [...] "political theory of the Kingly Way", [...] "practical differences between consular jurisdiction and extraterritoriality", <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> [...] "realize the governance of the Kingly Way".

The Japanese professors were greatly impressed with the Confucian idealism of their students, but noted that their students all used stock phrases to the extent it was hard to tell their essays apart, cited examples of wise judges from ancient China while ignoring more recent legal developments, and were long on expressing idealistic statements about how the wangdao would led to a perfect society, but were short on how explaining just how this was to be done in practice.|$|E
