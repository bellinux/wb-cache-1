40|$|AbstractFor the {{generalized}} Sturm–Liouville problems we can construct an SL(2,R) Lie-group shooting method to find eigenvalues. By using the closure {{property of the}} Lie-group, a one-step Lie-group transformation between the boundary values at two ends of the considered interval is established. Hence, we can theoretically derive an <b>analytical</b> <b>characteristic</b> equation to determine the eigenvalues for {{the generalized}} Sturm–Liouville problems. Because the closed-form formulas are derived to calculate the unknown left-boundary values in terms of λ, the present method provides an easy numerical implementation and has a cheap computational cost.

Based on the <b>analytical</b> <b>characteristic</b> function method, we derive the accurate probability {{distribution of the}} {{multiple access}} interference and calculate the average symbol error rate (SER) of the proposed system. Simulation results are provided to verify the analytical frameworks in additive white Gaussian noise channel and to illustrate the system performance in realistic UWB fading channels.

With the advancement of Social and Human Sciences, assessments gained both a reflexive and an <b>analytical</b> <b>characteristic</b> and now they constitute a system of support and guidance for individual and group learning, all without losing sight of building character in the students. Supported by qualitative research, this study identified and discussed the assessments used by 14 university lecturers in the state of São Paulo who teach Gymnastics in the Physical Education undergraduate courses. The results showed different formats of assessment, namely: theoretical; debates; practical/experience; research; self-assessment and peer-review. None of the evaluated lecturers clearly stated the assessment criteria, becoming it, mainly, subjective.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the comparing of sensory and <b>analytical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of red wines infected by Brettanomyces/Dekkera. For the purposes of the research twenty four samples of red wines were selected, that had been evidently affected by Brettanomyces/Dekkera yeasts. This yeast genus produces the volatile phenols linked to the distinctive aromas/sensory compounds in red wines characterised as being reminiscent of farmyards, animals or phenolic notes. The theoretical part covers the genesis and development of the infection in red wine, and how the sensory qualities of wine are affected by Brettanomyces/Dekkera yeasts. Possible causes of the infection and ways of preventing wines from becoming infected are discussed. The experimental part focuses on the analysis and statistical assessment comparation of the sensory evaluation resulst and the chemical analysis of volatile compounds results.

The dynamic response of nematics to crossed fields has been studied experimentally by Faetti et al.

We investigate the director {{orientation of}} an incompressible nematic liquid crystal under the influence of tilted, mutually perpendicular, constant magnetic and electric fields. We assume that flow effects are negligible and employ an averaging method to derive an equation describing the dynamic response of the average molecular tilt angle. Travelling wave solutions are calculated and we discuss criteria for their stability. Finally, we investigate director response when both or either of the applied fields are turned off with a view to gaining information about the characteristic times of relaxation.

40|$|A {{technique}} is presented whereby the mutual interaction between {{a small number}} of elements in a planar array can be interpolated and extrapolated to accurately predict the combined interactions in a much larger array of many elements. An approximate series expression is developed, based upon knowledge of the <b>analytical</b> <b>characteristic</b> behavior of the mutual admittance between small aperture antenna elements in a conducting ground plane. This expression is utilized to analytically extend known values for a few spacings and orientations to other element configurations, thus eliminating the need to numerically integrate a large number of highly oscillating and slowly converging functions. This paper shows that the technique can predict very accurately the mutual coupling between elements in a very large planar array with a knowledge of the self-admittance of an isolated element and the coupling between only two elements arranged in eight different pair combinations. These eight pair combinations do not necessarily have to correspond to pairs in the large array, although all of the individual elements must be identical...|$|E

Among these five procedures solubilisation in aqua regia provides the best results, i. e., limits of detection of elements within 0. 12 – 31. 4 ngmL− 1, precision of 0. 4 – 5 % and accuracy better than 5 %. Additionally, a good agreement between the measured and certified values of the NIST 1567 a was found for all elements. The proposed procedure is simple, reduces sample handling and minimises time and reagent consumption.

40|$|Various {{bifurcation}} behaviors, including asymmetric axial buckling {{induced by}} end thrust, bifurcation under external pressure, and eversion without any loading, of a soft circular hollow cylinder (or cylindrical shell) composed of functionally graded incompressible elastomeric material are considered in a unified way. Based on the nonlinear elasticity theory of a deformable continuous body undergoing large deformation and the linearized incremental theory for a superimposed infinitesimal deformation, an efficient approach for buckling analysis is developed {{and applied to}} the cylinder subjected {{to a combination of}} axial end thrust and internal/external pressure. It is based on the state-space formalism, which naturally avoids the derivatives of instantaneous material constants, enabling a convenient and accurate numerical implementation. Along with the layerwise method, an <b>analytical</b> <b>characteristic</b> equation (i. e. the bifurcation criterion) governing the general asymmetric buckling of the cylinder is derived. Detailed parametric studies are then carried out for a pressurized soft functionally graded hollow cylinder using an incompressible Mooney-Rivlin material model. The effects of material gradient on bifurcation induced either by end thrust or external pressure are discussed through numerical examples. Not only does this study provide an efficient tool for buckling analysis of soft cylinders, some findings that are unique to a functionally graded material are also highlighted. All in all, it is found highly possible to tune the bifurcation behavior of soft elastomeric cylindrical shells by tailoring material composition and/or adjusting the pressures acting on the surfaces of the cylinder...|$|E

A new thermal annealing approach {{was developed for}} fabricating these palladium nanocrystals as a working electrode on a gas permeable membrane to study the facet effects of the oxygen reduction process in an ionic liquid, 1 -butyl- 1 -methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([Bmpy][NTf 2]). Results were {{compared with the same}} processes at a conventional platinum electrode. Our study shows that the structural difference between the two facets of Pd nanocrystals has little effect on the oxygen reduction process but significantly affects the oxidation process of the superoxide. It is found that the Pd{ 110 }/IL interface can better stabilize superoxide radicals revealed by a more positive oxidation potential compared to that of Pd{ 100 }. In addition, the <b>analytical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of utilizing both palladium nanocrystals as electrodes for oxygen sensing is comparable with a polycrystal platinum oxygen sensor, in which Pd{ 110 } presents the best sensitivity and lowest detection limit.

40|$|The {{development}} of new optical sensing receptors not only {{need to focus on}} its sensitivity and selectivity aspects, but should also emphasis on the sustainability of the development as a whole. This report proposed a green synthesis method to produce fluorescent carbon nanoparticles via thermal carbonisation of orange peels. This is a sustainable option since used agricultural waste as starting precursor, involved no excess or toxic chemical reagents, produced low or no waste side product, and employed simple synthesis steps. Parameters governing the precursor conversion into carbon rich residues were investigated and found that the optimum carbonisation occurs at the temperature range of 300 - 350 &# 0176;C for an exposure time of 2 h. The carbon residue was then grinded into fine nanoparticles, dispersed in water and followed by sonication to promote better dispersion in water. Colloidal suspension remaining in the aliquot after centrifugation for 15 min at 13, 400 rpm was collected and found to show strong fluorescence emission at 435 nm, when excited at the optimum wavelength of 325 nm. This unique optical property has been utilised for sensing application since the fluorescence intensity was significantly quenched in the presence of heavy metal ions. <b>Analytical</b> <b>characteristic</b> was evaluated using standard Stern-Volmer equation and the limit of detection was evaluated to be significantly low that enable the practical utilisation for quantification applications.
