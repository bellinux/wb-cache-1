40|$|We report herein on a {{comparison}} of the performance of two different grinding wheels (conventional and CBN) in the transverse cylindrical grinding of a eutectic alloy. Three cutting conditions were tested: rough, semi-finishing and finishing. The parameters of evaluation were the cutting force, roughness and wheel wear. The optimal cutting force and roughness values were obtained when grinding with the conventional wheel, due to the superior <b>dressing</b> <b>operation</b> performed under every cutting condition tested. Although the CBN wheel presented the best G ratio values, they were lower than expected owing to the inappropriate <b>dressing</b> <b>operation</b> applied. Excessive wheel corner wear was detected in both wheels, caused by the grinding kinematics (transverse grinding) employed. In terms of cutting force and roughness, the conventional wheel proved to be the better choice under the conditions tested.

40|$|Adhesively bonded {{repairs to}} {{metallic}} aircraft structure {{can be used}} in a variety of applications to solve difficult maintenance issues where traditional mechanically fastened repairs are often unsatisfactory. For example bonded repairs have been applied to reduce stress intensity in fatigue prone areas of aircraft and, thereby, extend service life of the component, providing substantial maintenance savings. Despite their valuable contribution to aircraft maintenance, bonded repairs are treated as fail-safe items when used on primary aircraft structue. One of the reasons for the lack of credit for bonded repairs is the absence of a reliable non-destructive inspection (NDI) technique that can guarantee bond quality and strength. One solution to reduce this problem is the development of objective prebond inspection techniques that can guarantee the quality and reliability of the critical surface treatment process applied prior to the <b>adhesive</b> bonding <b>operation.</b> The use of a gloss-meter unit and surface quality monitor to quantify the prebond condition of metallic substrates is an effort to further improve the reliability and reproducibility of current bonding operations...|$|R

On the other hand, a method of monitoring the <b>dressing</b> <b>operation</b> in real time, identifying the moment in which the dresser is worn and thus to be replaced, something which can be of great importance for the grinding process in order to assure quality and accuracy of the workpieces. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the wear of the single point dresser, through spectral analysis of vibration signal during the <b>dressing</b> <b>operation.</b> For this <b>dressing</b> assays were performed using a flat grinding and input variables a grinding wheel aluminum oxide, one the single point dresser of synthetic diamond r type CVD (Chemical Vapour Deposition), depth of dressing 40 μm, dresser speed of 3. 45 mm /s {{and the degree of}} coating Ud equal to 1 at the beginning of dressing. The output variables were the acquisition of the vibration signals via an accelerometer fixed in the dresser holder, collected by an oscilloscope and dresser wear measurements using a microscope. Through spectral analysis of vibration signal in three conditions of use, and, new, half-life and worn, using the Welch method and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), it was possible to identify the frequency bands between 1 kHz and 8 kHz in the amplitude increased according to the dresser wear. It has been found that the in-creased vibration activity is directly proportional to the CVD dresser wear. It was possible to identify fre-quency bands that best characterize such a situation, as in bands of 2 kHz to 4 kHz and 6 kHz and 8 kHz. The results indicate the possibility of implementing a real-time monitoring system, from the use of digital filters in these frequency bands...|$|R

40|$|Laser {{ablation}} {{has been}} evaluated as a surface pretreatment prior to adhesive bonding. In prior experimental work, {{it was observed}} that when adhesively bonded, composite, single lap shear samples fail, the fracture often occurs at either the adhesive/adherend interface or in the resin rich surface layer of the composite. These two areas represent the weakest portion of the joint. Laser ablation pretreatment generates areas where the resin on the composite surface is selectively removed leaving behind exposed reinforcing fibers which are the major load bearing members of the composite. In a subsequent <b>adhesive</b> bonding <b>operation,</b> this allows portions of the fibers to be encapsulated in the adhesive while other portions of the fiber remain in the composite resin. This type of pretreatment permits fibers to bridge and reinforce the interface between adhesive and adherend. A secondary benefit is the removal of surface contaminantes by pyrolysis. Microscopic observation of laser ablated surfaces indicates a prominent, fiber rich area. Results of the mechanical evaluation indicated that the lap shear strength for laser ablated samples was significantly higher than specimens with no pretreatment or with solvent cleaning only, but were slightly lower than specimens that were mechanically roughened and cleaned with solvents prior to bonding...|$|R
