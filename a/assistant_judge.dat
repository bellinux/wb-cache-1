5|$|Zorobabela Kaʻauwai (/1806 – August 8, 1856) was {{an early}} {{politician}} and judge in the Kingdom of Hawaii.

An early convert to Christianity and devout adherent of the Protestant faith, his first name is a Hawaiian form of the Biblical name Zerubbabel.|$|E
25|$|Brisbane {{was doing}} useful work, {{but he could}} not escape the effects of the {{constant}} faction fights which also plagued previous governors. Henry G. Douglass, the assistant-surgeon, was the centre of one of the bitter conflicts. Consequently, charges of various kinds against Brisbane were sent to England. The worst of these, that he had connived at sending female convicts to Emu Plains for immoral purposes, was investigated by William Stewart, the lieutenant-governor, John Stephen, <b>assistant</b> <b>judge,</b> and the Rev. William Cowper, senior assistant-chaplain, and found to be without the slightest foundation. Brisbane discovered that Goulburn, the colonial secretary, had been withholding documents from him and answering some without reference to the governor, and in 1824 reported his conduct to Lord Bathurst. In reply, Bathurst recalled both the governor and the colonial secretary in dispatches dated 29 December 1824.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial of}} the alleged conspirators began on May 9. A {{military}} tribunal, rather than a civilian court, {{was chosen as the}} prosecutorial venue because government officials thought that its more lenient rules of evidence would enable the court {{to get to the bottom}} of what was then perceived by the public as a vast conspiracy. A military tribunal also avoided the possibility of jury nullification, for federal officials worried that a jury drawn from the pro-Southern populace of the District of Columbia might free the prisoners. All eight alleged conspirators were tried simultaneously. The prosecution was led by Judge Advocate General Brigadier General Joseph Holt, assisted by <b>Assistant</b> <b>Judge</b> Advocate General Colonel Henry Lawrence Burnett, and Judge Advocate Major John Bingham. A panel of nine judges (all military officers), sat in judgment over the accused. Conviction required a simple majority of judges, while imposition of the death sentence required a two-thirds majority. The only appeal was directly to the President of the United States.|$|E

60|$|Though {{there was}} the same throng in the court as on the Monday, there {{did not seem to}} be the same hubbub on the opening of the day's proceedings. The barristers were less busy with their papers, the {{attorneys}} sat quite at their ease, and the Chief Justice, with an <b>assistant</b> <b>judge,</b> who was his bench-fellow, appeared for some minutes to be quite passive. Then the Solicitor-General arose and said that, with permission, he would occupy the court for only a few minutes. He had stated on Monday his belief that an application would be made to the court on behalf of other interests than those which had been represented when the court first met. It appeared that he had been wrong in that surmise. Of course he had no knowledge on the subject, but it did not appear that any learned gentleman was prepared to address the court for any third party. As he, on behalf of his client, had receded from the case, his Lordship would probably say what, in his Lordship's opinion, should now be the proceeding of the court. The Earl Lovel abandoned his plea, and perhaps the court would, in those circumstances, decide that its jurisdiction in the matter was over. Then the Lord Chief Justice, with his <b>assistant</b> <b>judge,</b> retired for a while, and all the assembled crowd appeared to be at liberty to discuss the matter just as everybody pleased.|$|E
