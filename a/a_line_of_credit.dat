5|$|In June 2012, Carrols {{acquired}} 278 BK locations from Burger King {{for approximately}} $150 million. In exchange, Burger King parent, Burger King Corporation took a 28.9 {{percent stake in}} the company. The transaction involved <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> that would be used by Carrols to renovate more than 450 of its stores and a 29.7% ownership stake in the franchise going to Burger King. Additional agreements will give Carrols the right of first refusal on approximately 500 stores. If it chooses to exercise these rights, Carrols could become the dominant franchisee of Burger King in the United States with possible control of hundreds of locations in twenty states. Three months after the acquisition, Carrols saw a 37.8% increase in total sales and 8.9% same store sales with a 4.9% increase in customer traffic. As of the end of Burger King's 2012 fiscal year, Carrols operates over 575 restaurants in New York, Ohio, and eighteen other states.|$|E
5|$|After {{hearing about}} the game's success, Bushnell decided {{there would be more}} profit for Atari to {{manufacture}} the game rather than license it, but the interest of Bally and Midway had already been piqued. Bushnell decided to inform each of the two groups that the other was uninterested—Bushnell told the Bally executives that the Midway executives did not want it and vice versa—to preserve the relationships for future dealings. Upon hearing Bushnell's comment, the two groups declined his offer. Bushnell had difficulty finding financial backing for Pong; banks viewed it as a variant of pinball, which at the time the general public associated with the Mafia. Atari eventually obtained <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> from Wells Fargo that it used to expand its facilities to house an assembly line. The company announced Pong on 29 November 1972. Management sought assembly workers at the local unemployment office, but was unable to keep up with demand. The first arcade cabinets produced were assembled very slowly, about ten machines a day, many of which failed quality testing. Atari eventually streamlined the process and began producing the game in greater quantities. By 1973, they began shipping Pong to other countries with the aid of foreign partners.|$|E
5|$|The {{termination}} of the operation caught the CIA by surprise, and King quickly attempted to salvage what he could. The freighter was redirected to Panama, where the arms were unloaded; King kept the weapons there {{in the hope that}} the project could be rejuvenated. Castillo Armas was paid a retainer of $3000 a week, which allowed him to maintain a small force. The CIA remained in contact with him, and continued to provide support to the rebels. The CIA found it difficult to end the operation without drawing attention to it. Peréz Jimenez opened <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> that would allow Castillo Armas to purchase airplanes, and Trujillo and Somoza continued to support the operation, although they acknowledged that it would have to be postponed. The money paid to Castillo Armas has been described as a way of making sure that he did not attempt any premature action. Even after the operation had been terminated, the CIA received reports from Seekford that the Guatemalan rebels were planning assassinations. Castillo Armas made plans to use groups of soldiers in civilian clothing from Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador to kill communist leaders in Guatemala. King continued to explore the CIA's ability to move arms around Central America without the approval of the State Department.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} between linked accounts and <b>an</b> overdraft <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> is that <b>an</b> overdraft <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> is typically only usable for overdraft protection.

5|$|The Bank offers {{flexible}} loans with maturities {{as long as}} 30 {{years and}} custom-tailored repayment scheduling. The IBRD also offers loans in local currencies. Through a joint effort between the IBRD and the International Finance Corporation, the Bank offers financing to subnational entities either with or without sovereign guarantees. For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred Drawdown Option which serves as <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program. Among the World Bank Group's credit enhancement and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign default risk, partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or subnational entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations. The IBRD's Enclave Partial Risk Guarantee to cover private projects in member countries of the IDA against sovereign governments' failures to fulfill contractual obligations.

It also issues catastrophe bonds which transfer catastrophic risks from borrowers to investors. The IBRD reported $26.7 billion in lending commitments for 132 projects in fiscal year 2011, significantly less than its $44.2 billion in commitments during fiscal year 2010.|$|E
25|$|On December 20, {{the governments}} of Canada and Ontario offered $3.3 billion in loans to the auto industry. Under the plan GM was to receive $3 billion and Chrysler was to receive the rest.

50|$|A {{credit limit}} is {{the maximum amount}} <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> that a {{financial}} institution or other lender will extend to a debtor for <b>a</b> particular <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> (sometimes called <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> <b>line,</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit,</b> or <b>a</b> tradeline).

25|$|A {{new system}} of credit, the crop lien, became closely {{associated}} with sharecropping. Under this system, a planter or merchant extended <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> to the sharecropper while taking the year's crop as collateral. The sharecropper could then draw food and supplies all year long. When the crop was harvested, the planter or merchants who held the lien sold the harvest for the sharecropper and settled the debt.|$|E
25|$|A {{credit card}} {{is part of}} a system of {{payments}} named after the small plastic card issued to users of the system. The issuer of the card grants <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> to the consumer from which the user can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance to the user. In 1946, American banker John C. Biggins of the Flatbush National Bank of Brooklyn invented the first bank-issued credit card.|$|E
25|$|However, {{other critics}} in D.C. {{claim that the}} GSE {{business}} model faces inherent conflicts due to its combination of government mission and private ownership. The GSEs were given monopoly privileges against which private enterprise could not compete. Both GSEs had <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> with the US Treasury Department, and both GSEs were exempt from state and local income tax on corporate earnings. The GSEs {{were the only two}} Fortune 500 companies exempt from regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because of implicit government backing, Fannie Mae discount notes became the second-largest short-term notes issued (second only to Treasury bills).|$|E

25|$|According to some reports, the People's Republic of China {{has offered}} to extend <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> to South Sudan for several years while an {{alternative}} pipeline to the Kenyan coast is laid and an export deal is worked out with the Kenyan government, but this scenario is regarded as less likely than continued South Sudanese dependence on Sudanese infrastructure. If such a deal were struck, though, and South Sudan began exporting oil from Kenyan ports, the US would become a potential trade partner and South Sudanese oil importer. In the meantime, the South Sudanese government intends to lobby the US to ease restrictions on American companies doing business with Sudan.|$|E
25|$|The land {{bounded by}} 48th and 51st Streets between Fifth and Sixth Avenues was {{originally}} a botanical garden. It later {{came under the}} ownership of Columbia University. The plot itself was occupied by over 200 low-rise tenements. In the summer of 1928, two prospective buyers, Metropolitan Opera and John D. Rockefeller Jr., were mentioned for the site. Columbia leased the plot to Rockefeller for 87 years {{at a cost of}} $3 million per year. This consisted of a 27-year lease (with the option for three 21-year renewals for a total of 87 years) for the site from Columbia; negotiating <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and covering ongoing expenses through the sale of oil company stock.

25|$|In 1944, Dunn {{was invited}} {{to serve on the}} board of {{directors}} of Canada Steamship Lines (CSL), whose ore carriers were an important transporter of ore and coal for the Algoma Steel plant which operated under a geographical disadvantage to its more southerly competitors. Unhappy over CSL's policy of prioritizing service to his steel mill's competition on the lower section of the Great Lakes, with backing from a Winnipeg, Manitoba businessman plus the Montreal publishing magnate, John Wilson McConnell, James Dunn quietly set about buying up shares of the shipping line. He secured <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> from the Bank of Montreal and through Earle McLaughlin at the Royal Bank of Canada he raised a war chest that saw him gain effective control of Canada Steamship Lines in 1951. This was followed up by the acquisition of another shipping line with cargo vessels capable of cost-effective delivery of Algoma Steel's products to the southern markets. Within a few years, Dunn was exporting iron ore from his Algoma Ore Properties Limited to American buyers.|$|E
500|$|Between January 12 and February 2, 1967, the Experience took a {{break from}} {{recording}} while they played 20 dates in England, including a second appearance on Top of the Pops, on January 18.

He explained: [...] "There was a bank above the studio... and it was at the time when computers were just coming in... we would play so loud that it would foul up the computers upstairs." [...] Brian Jones and Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones encouraged Chandler to try Olympic Studios, which was considered the top independent London studio. Despite the growing chart success of their first single, Chandler's money problems persisted. Olympic required advance payment for studio time, but Polydor had not yet released any funds to Track for disbursement. When Chandler went to Polydor asking for relief they responded by guaranteeing him <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> at Olympic.|$|E

2500|$|A {{credit card}} is a payment card issued to users ({{cardholder}}s) {{to enable the}} cardholder to pay a merchant {{for goods and services}} based on the cardholder's promise to the card issuer to pay them for the amounts so paid plus the other agreed charges. The card issuer (usually a bank) creates a revolving account and grants <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> to the cardholder, from which the cardholder can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance. [...] In other words, credit cards combine payment services with extensions of credit. [...] Complex fee structures in the credit card industry may limit customers' ability to comparison shop, help ensure that the industry is not price-competitive and help maximize industry profits. [...] Because of this, legislatures have regulated credit card fees.|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately, Brummell's wealthy {{friends had}} {{a less than}} {{satisfactory}} influence on him; he began spending and gambling as though his fortune were as ample as theirs.
