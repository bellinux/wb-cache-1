The red and blue stamp's vignette depicted Army JN-4 #38262, the aircraft that made the first Air Mail flight from Washington two days later, and the 24 cent fee it represented was apportioned at two cents for postage, 12 cents for air service, and 10 cents for Special Delivery. On July 15 the rate was dropped to 16 cents for the first ounce and 6 cents for each additional ounce, and on December 15 the rate was dropped again to 6 cents per ounce when Special Delivery was made optional. Additional monochromatic stamps of similar design to C-3 were also issued contemporaneously with these rate changes in 16 cent (green) and 6 cent (orange) denominations. Although these extra fee stamps were issued for use on mails to be serviced by air, the legend [...] "AIR MAIL" [...] did not appear on any USPOD stamp until eight years later when the 10-cent C-7 rectangular was issued on February 13, 1926, {{two days before the}} first ever mail flight under contract with a commercial carrier was made on February 15, an eastbound trip between Detroit and Cleveland over CAM Route 7.|$|R

We also examined whether preferences for initials and non-initial name-letters tap different aspects of self-esteem. Participants from a community sample (N = 161; 58 men and 106 women, 17 - 67 years, Mage = 34. 57, SD = 13. 28) completed daily <b>letter</b> <b>rating</b> tasks and state self-esteem questionnaires for seven consecutive days. They also completed a trait self-esteem questionnaire on the first measurement day as well as six months later. Preference scores for first-name initials were stronger but more unstable than preference scores for other name-letters. Preferences for first-name initials were primarily associated with directly measured state self-esteem whereas preferences for non-initials were primarily associated with directly measured trait self-esteem even if the latter was measured six months later. We thus showed that preferences for initials and non-initials are not simply interchangeable. Previous <b>letter</b> <b>rating</b> studies, which almost exclusively used initial preferences, should be interpreted in terms of state rather than trait self-esteem. In future studies, researchers should focus on the name-letter preference that reflects the aspect of self-esteem they wish to address. status: publishe...|$|R
