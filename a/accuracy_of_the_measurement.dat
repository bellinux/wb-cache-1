25|$|Even {{before the}} resurfacing, {{there was some}} dispute as to the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measurement.</b> In the 1980s, ESPN often claimed the turns were banked at 35 degrees during {{television}} telecast of events at the track. In an interview with Stock Car Racings Larry Cothren, driver Ryan Newman openly disputed the measurement of the banking of Bristol Motor Speedway's turns. Newman's crew measured the banking during a test session to aid with setups, {{and found that the}} turns were banked 26 degrees, rather than the advertised 36 degrees. A Camping World Truck Series open test noted the banking had dropped following resurfacing, to 22–27degrees, in a variable banking configuration.|$|E
25|$|Heisenberg gave, as an illustration, the {{measurement}} of the position and momentum of an electron using a photon of light. In measuring the electron's position, the higher {{the frequency of the}} photon, the more accurate is {{the measurement}} of the position {{of the impact of the}} photon with the electron, but the greater is the disturbance of the electron. This is because from the impact with the photon, the electron absorbs a random amount of energy, rendering the measurement obtained of its momentum increasingly uncertain (momentum is velocity multiplied by mass), for one is necessarily measuring its post-impact disturbed momentum from the collision products and not its original momentum. With a photon of lower frequency, the disturbance (and hence uncertainty) in the momentum is less, but so is the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> of the position of the impact.|$|E
2500|$|Albert A. Michelson (1881) {{tried to}} measure the {{relative}} motion of the Earth and aether (Aether-Wind), as it was expected in Fresnel's theory, by using an interferometer. He could not determine any relative motion, so he interpreted the result as a confirmation of the thesis of Stokes. However, Lorentz (1886) showed Michelson's calculations were wrong {{and that he had}} overestimated the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measurement.</b> This, together with the large margin of error, made the result of Michelson's experiment inconclusive. In addition, Lorentz showed that Stokes' completely dragged aether led to contradictory consequences, and therefore he supported an aether theory similar to Fresnel's. To check Fresnel's theory again, Michelson and Edward W. Morley (1886) performed a repetition of the Fizeau experiment. Fresnel's dragging coefficient was confirmed very exactly on that occasion, and Michelson was now of the opinion that Fresnel's stationary aether theory was correct. To clarify the situation, Michelson and Morley (1887) repeated Michelson's 1881-experiment, and they substantially increased the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measurement.</b> However, this now famous Michelson–Morley experiment again yielded a negative result, i.e., no motion of the apparatus through the aether was detected (although the Earth's velocity is 60km/s different in the northern winter than summer). So the physicists were confronted with two seemingly contradictory experiments: the 1886-experiment as an apparent confirmation of Fresnel's stationary aether, and the 1887-experiment as an apparent confirmation of Stokes' completely dragged aether.|$|E
