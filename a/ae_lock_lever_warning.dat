5000|$|First {{manufactured}} in 1976, the Benelli B76 is a locked-breech, fixed-barrel pistol, that works {{thanks to a}} unique [...] "inertia lock" [...] system, as explained in [...] In this system, the gun has a bolt provided with ribs extending transversely to the bolt axis and adapted to engage in and disengage from corresponding mating grooves in the receiver, and <b>a</b> <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> that links the bolt with the slide which acts as a bolt carrier. Upon firing, while the pistol recoils in {{the hand of the}} shooter, the inertia of the slide makes it maintain its position relative to the receiver, constraining the bolt ribs' motion in the corresponding grooves via the <b>locking</b> <b>lever,</b> and so keeping the breech positively <b>locked.</b> <b>As</b> soon as the recoil movement of the pistol in the hand of the shooter slows down, the slide tends to continue its rearward movement, so retreating relative to the receiver. At that point, the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> does not force the bolt into its locking recesses any more and the bolt is free to recoil as well, pushed by the residual pressure of the gasses in the barrel with enough force to complete the shooting cycle.|$|R

50|$|In US English usage, 'skeleton key' is also {{occasionally}} used to mean <b>a</b> standard <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> key. It {{is sometimes}} misapplied {{to refer to}} any antique key.|$|R
50|$|The {{program was}} encoded on a punched card {{and could be}} {{prepared}} on any keypunch (a keypunch would operate even if no program card was in place). The program card was wrapped around the program drum, and clamped in place. The drum rotated as the card being punched moved through the punching mechanism. The holes in the program card were sensed by an array of starwheels that would cause levers to rise and fall as {{the holes in the}} program card passed beneath the starwheels, activating electrical contacts. The program was encoded in the top six rows 12,11,0,1,2,3. If the optional Second Program feature was installed, another program could be encoded in the bottom six rows 4,5,6,7,8,9. A switch let the operator select which program to use. The central cover on the keypunch could be tilted open toward the operator and <b>a</b> <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> released, allowing the program drum to be removed and replaced.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> 3 <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> is <b>a</b> {{common type}} of <b>lever</b> <b>lock,</b> but is {{generally}} used for low security applications such as internal doors as their tolerances are much lower (there are fewer combinations of key available, so {{they are likely to}} unlock doors they shouldn't).|$|R
25|$|After having built {{a number}} of prototypes and {{experimental}} vehicles, AvtoVAZ designers launched the first car entirely of their own design, the VAZ-2121 Niva, in 1977. This highly popular and innovative SUV was made with off-road use in mind, featuring a gearbox with <b>a</b> central differential <b>lock</b> <b>lever</b> {{as well as a}} low- and high-range selector lever.|$|R
50|$|A tribrach is an {{attachment}} plate used {{to attach a}} surveying instrument, for example a theodolite, total station, GNSS antenna or target to a tripod. A tribrach allows the survey instrument to be repeatedly placed {{in the same position}} with sub-millimetre precision, by just loosening and re-tightening <b>a</b> <b>locking</b> handle or <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|In this {{mechanism}} the reversing rod {{is controlled by}} a screw and nut, worked by a wheel in the cab. The nut either operates on the reversing rod directly or through a lever, as above. The screw and nut may be cut with a double thread and a coarse pitch to move the mechanism as quickly as possible. The wheel is fitted with <b>a</b> <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> to prevent creep {{and there is an}} indicator to show the percentage of cutoff in use. This method of altering the cutoff offers finer control than the sector lever, but it has the disadvantage of slow operation. It is most suitable for long-distance passenger engines where frequent changes of cutoff are not required and where fine adjustments offer the most benefit. On locomotives fitted with Westinghouse air brake equipment and Stephenson valve gear, it was common to use the screw housing as an air cylinder, with the nut extended to form a piston. Compressed air from the brake reservoirs was applied {{to one side of the}} piston to reduce the effort required to lift the heavy expansion link, with gravity assisting in the opposite direction.|$|R
5000|$|The gauge {{consists}} of a beam, a headstock, and a scribing or marking implement, typically a pin, knife, pen or wheel. The headstock slides along the beam, and is locked in place by various means: <b>a</b> <b>locking</b> screw, cam <b>lever,</b> or a wedge. The marking implement is fixed to {{one end of the}} beam.|$|R
5000|$|The Prescott and Cedar Mill Pentium 4 cores, {{as well as}} the Smithfield and Presler Pentium D cores, {{used the}} LGA 775 socket. In July 2006, Intel {{released}} the desktop processor Core 2 Duo (codenamed Conroe), which also uses this socket, as does the subsequent Core 2 Quad. Intel changed from Socket 478 to LGA 775 because the new pin type offers better power distribution to the processor, allowing the front-side bus to be raised to 1600 MT/s. The 'T' in Socket T was derived from the now cancelled Tejas core, which was to replace the Prescott core. Another advantage for Intel with this newer architecture is that it is now the motherboard which has the pins, rather than the CPU, transferring the risk of pins being bent from the CPU to the motherboard.The CPU is pressed into place by a [...] "load plate", rather than human fingers directly. The installer lifts the hinged [...] "load plate", inserts the processor, closes the load plate {{over the top of the}} processor, and pushes down <b>a</b> <b>locking</b> <b>lever.</b> The pressure of the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> on the load plate clamps the processor's 775 copper contact points firmly down onto the socket's 775 pins, ensuring a good connection. The load plate only covers the edges of the top surface of the CPU (integrated heat spreader). The center is free to make contact with the cooling device placed on top of the CPU. The spacing for the CPU cooler mounting holes is 72mm x 72mm.|$|R
5000|$|For 2011, Proto {{ended the}} Proto Matrix Rail series {{and made the}} Reflex Rail and the Rail to take over. The Reflex Rail is the higher quality of the two and {{functions}} similar to the other PMRs, but had a minor overhauling changing the milling, adding a rubber [...] "contact" [...] pad {{in front of the}} gun, simplifying the bolt system, adding <b>a</b> <b>lever</b> <b>locking</b> feedneck, and replacing the eye covers with an eye pipe. The Rail is the cheaper of the two and is similar to a Smart Parts Ion in terms of operation, but has an almost identical bolt to the Reflex Rail. The Rail also has an eye pipe, but does not have <b>a</b> <b>lever</b> <b>locking</b> feedneck, on off airport, and has a composite ultralite frame as opposed to the aluminum ultralite frame on the Reflex.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> {{is made up}} of a set of 'levers' (typically {{between two}} and five) which are raised to {{different}} heights by the key when it is turned. Once all the levers have been moved to the correct height, the locking bolt is free to slide across and secure the door. The teeth or bittings of the key have flat tops rather than being pointed. <b>Lever</b> <b>lock</b> keys tend to be bigger and less convenient for carrying, although <b>lever</b> <b>locks</b> are considered to be harder to pick and so are recommended by most insurance companies.|$|R
40|$|A Seat Track Attach Mechanism (SAM) is a multiple-use {{clamping}} device {{intended for use}} in mounting various objects on the standard seat tracks used on the International Space Station (ISS). The basic SAM design could also be adapted to other settings in which seat tracks are available: for example, SAM-like devices {{could be used as}} universal aircraft-seat-track mounting clamps. A SAM (see figure) is easily installed by inserting it in a seat track, then actuating <b>a</b> <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> to clamp the SAM to the track. The SAM includes <b>an</b> over-center <b>locking</b> feature that prevents premature disengagement that could be caused by some inadvertent movements of persons or objects in the vicinity. A SAM can be installed in, or removed from, any position along a seat track, without regard for the locations of the circular access holes. Hence, one or more SAM(s) can be used to mount an object or objects on a track or a pair of tracks in an infinite number of preferred configurations. A SAM can be incorporated into a dual swivel device, so that two of the SAMs can be made to lock onto two side-by-side seat tracks simultaneously, as would be the case in a standard ISS rack bay where two side-by-side racks reside. The main benefit to using two SAMs in a side-by-side arrangement is to provide a coupled load. By picking up load points on two seat tracks, a coupled loading is created, improving the stability and strength since the load is spread to two seat tracks at a short distance...|$|R
5000|$|In 1920, the Belgian arms {{manufacturer}} Fabrique Nationale (FN) acquired {{sales and}} production {{rights to the}} BAR series of firearms in Europe from Colt. The first BAR model sold by FN was the Kg m/21 (Kg—Kulsprutegevär or [...] "machine rifle") chambered for the 6.5×55mm m/94 cartridge. The m/21 is {{a variant of the}} Model 1919 designed to Swedish specifications and manufactured initially by Colt's and later under license at the Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori in Eskilstuna. Compared to the Model 1919, the Swedish weapon has—apart from the different caliber—a spiked bipod and pistol grip. The m/21 would become one of Sweden's main support weapons in the interwar years together with the water-cooled belt-fed Ksp m/1914 medium machine gun (Swedish adaptation of the Austrian M07/12). Dissatisfied with the rapidly overheating fixed barrel of the m/21, Carl Gustaf began to design a new quick-detach mechanism for the barrel which mates the externally grooved chamber to a series of rotating flanges in the receiver operated by <b>a</b> <b>locking</b> <b>lever.</b> The barrel also received cooling fins along its entire length. These enhancements were incorporated into the fm/1935 prototype which was favorably evaluated during trials in 1935. The final version was the Kg m/37, adopted for service in 1937, which uses a smooth contour, unfinned barrel. Numerous m/21 guns were retrofitted with the screw-on receiver extension and quick-change barrel, and renamed the Kg m/21-37. The m/37 remained in service until being replaced by the FN MAG, but was still in second-line use until 1980. Carl Gustaf also developed a belt-fed prototype; however, it was never adopted.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> magnetic-coded <b>lock</b> is <b>a</b> <b>lock</b> {{device that}} uses pins in {{combination}} with magnets to prevent entry by either non-matching keys by teething or magnetic polarity. Magnetic-coded locks encompass knob <b>locks,</b> cylinder <b>locks,</b> <b>lever</b> <b>locks,</b> and deadbolt locks as well as applications in other security devices.|$|R
5000|$|The {{four-wheel drive}} system employs three {{differentials}} (centre, front and rear). The transfer case involves a high/low range selector lever and <b>a</b> central differential <b>lock</b> <b>lever.</b> Low range can be selected with the centre differential locked or unlocked. The original Niva had a maximum speed of 81 mph, [...] and can cruise at 90 km/h while consuming petrol at [...] Its towing capacity is rated {{for up to}} 860 kg (1900 lb). It debuted in Western Europe at the 1978 Paris Motor Salon, and rapidly captured forty percent of Europe's market for four-wheel drive vehicles, making it Lada's top-selling export. Because of export demand, and higher priority for exports, domestic customers faced long waiting lists.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> 5 <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> {{is often}} {{required}} for home insurance and often {{recommended by the}} police for home security. There are various grades but the current British Standard (BS3621:2007) is usually required for insurance purposes. Valerie Olifent notes that [...] "The doors of many historic churches still carry <b>an</b> old wooden <b>lock</b> although often you find that a modern 5-lever mortice lock has been installed alongside it to meet insurance requirements." [...] BS3621:2007 requires a bolt throw of 20 mm rather than the 14 mm of the earlier British Standard.|$|R
50|$|The warded lock {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} lock designs which can be found as far back as ancient China and Rome. During the Middle Ages they were used prolifically on monasteries where, because money and time were not issues, their {{complexity}} grew. Warded locks are still in use today in the UK and Ireland for low security applications, and on heritage sites such as ancient monuments and churches to preserve original features, with primary security being provided by other means such as <b>a</b> <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> mechanism installed alongside.|$|R
2500|$|The 1977 models had {{numerous}} changes. Most noticeable {{was a new}} front end that AMC intended to make exclusive for the Gremlin line, consisting of independent squared headlight bezels with rounded corners and an egg-crate smile-shaped grille carrying over the rectangular parking lights of {{the previous two years}} and a new front bumper. A second [...] "American" [...] emblem was applied over the front edge of the hood on the right corner. The two-point seatbelts were replaced by fixed three-point units on both sedan models. Wagons included three-point retractable units as factory issue. The Carter RBS carburetor was discontinued leaving only the YF model on the 258 six. Two-door sedans with the manual transmissions now featured a floor-mounted gearshift with low-back fold-down individual seats, while models with automatic transmissions retained the bench seat with split folding backs and a column-mounted shifter. This also meant manual units incorporated <b>a</b> safety <b>lock</b> <b>lever</b> in their steering column ignition switch shared with American Rally model. The seats and door panels were slightly modified from the last year. A new [...] "American" [...] emblem with different typography was applied to glove box door. The [...] "258" [...] rear quarter panel emblems were replaced by new [...] "4.2" [...] units.|$|R
5000|$|Generation 5 Intimidators {{were made}} in two body styles: the Vice marker and the Protege, the former being the more {{expensive}} {{and in some ways}} more refined high-end version. The Vice came with a Tadao board stock as well as <b>a</b> <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> feedneck, <b>a</b> pillow bolt and more intricate milling. Generation 5 markers are four-eye capable which is a Bob Long design to incorporate four breakbeam eyes rather than the usual two. This design is intended to improve the reaction time of the board and bolt. Generation 5 markers are also in the category of very light guns weighing in at 1 lb. 13.2oz without a barrel.|$|R
2500|$|Most locks were {{fitted with}} V gates, but some locks, {{particularly}} around Seven Locks (7, 9, 10, and 12), and also all three North Branch locks (Locks 73–75 [...] ), were re-fitted with mechanical drop gates {{to speed up}} traffic in those areas. (Note that lock 6 had been converted to a drop gate, and later converted back to a V gate.) With the mechanical <b>locks,</b> <b>a</b> <b>lever</b> pulls a rod which connects to a crank, connected to another rod which turned the wicket valve {{which was in the}} floor (below where the gate would rest when opened) and water flows below the floor and into the lock. Hahn states this brought the time to lock through from about 10 minutes to around 3 minutes.|$|R
50|$|In railway {{signalling}}, an Annett’s key or Annett key {{is a large}} {{key that}} <b>locks</b> <b>levers</b> or other items of signalling apparatus, thereby serving as a portable form of interlocking. When not in use, the key is normally held in <b>an</b> Annett's <b>lock</b> (or Annett lock) that is fixed to the lever or concerned apparatus.|$|R
5000|$|Originally, {{the key was}} {{narrower}} than it {{is today}} and had the shape of <b>a</b> skeleton/basic <b>lever</b> <b>lock</b> keyhole, measuring six feet (1.8 m) wide, hence [...] "the key", with the free throw circle as the head, and the shaded lane as the body. It has been also called [...] "cup" [...] or [...] "bottle" [...] in other languages, because of how it looks from other perspectives. Due to the narrowness of the key, imposing centers, such as George Mikan, dominated the paint, scoring at will. To counter this, the key was widened into 12 feet (3.7 m) from 6 ft {{at the onset of the}} 1951-52 NBA season.|$|R
50|$|The Topcon RE Super, or Beseler Topcon Super D in USA, was {{launched}} by Tokyo Kogaku KK in 1963 and manufactured until 1971, {{at which point}} it was upgraded to the Super D and again to Super DM the following year. General sale continued for several years. These later models have <b>a</b> shutter release <b>lock</b> <b>lever</b> on the shutter release collar. It is a professional oriented 35mm SLR camera that had a comprehensive range of accessories available. It has a removable pentaprism viewfinder and focusing screen. It features the Exakta bayonet lens mount for interchangeable lenses. A special accessory shoe is situated {{at the base of}} the rewind knob with a standard PC sync. contact next to it. The release button is placed at the right-hand camera front, but it lacks a mirror-up facility. This was included on the upgraded versions. The standard lens is the RE.

50|$|The MAG uses ignited powder gases vented {{through a}} port in the barrel to propel a gas piston rod {{connected}} to the locking assembly (it uses a long-stroke piston system). The barrel breech is <b>locked</b> with <b>a</b> vertically tilting, downward <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> mechanism that is {{connected to the}} bolt carrier through an articulated joint. The locking shoulder and camming surfaces that guide the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> are located {{at the base of the}} receiver. The MAG uses a series of proven design concepts from other successful firearms, for example the locking mechanism is modeled on that of the Browning M1918 (BAR) automatic rifle, and the feed and trigger mechanisms are from the WWII-era MG42 universal machine gun.|$|R
50|$|The {{stripping}} pin is {{retained in}} the frame when pushed to the side to strip and is separate from the slide lock, as on the Megastar. The slide <b>lock</b> <b>lever,</b> magazine release and other features are reminiscent of the Megastar as well.|$|R
40|$|The adapted {{recumbent}} {{project was}} to redesign a disabled veteran’s recumbent bicycle. The main areas of concern were the crank pedal, chain tension, braking and steering system, and ergonomics. Since the customer is an avid biker, this bike will be used often, so the design {{is based on the}} ease of repair and replacement. The crank system was redesigned to a lightweight, adjustable part with chain clearance and high strength. The chain tension was improved by replacing the existing single idler wheel/chain tube system with a dual idler wheel system. The dual idler has a titanium sprocket in one of the wheels and a smooth low friction surface for the other wheel. A rear mechanical disc brake was added with <b>a</b> <b>locking</b> brake <b>lever.</b> The <b>locking</b> brake was added {{to make it easier for}} the user to get in and out of the seat. A weld was made on the rear seat stay in order to place a bracket for the rear brake calipers. The front hydraulic brakes were replaced with two mechanical disc brakes with mechanical lines routed to a single dual pull lever. Additional custom seat padding was made specifically for this recumbent tricycle. Using closed cell foam in a nylon cover with sewn on straps, the new seat simply attaches to the existing seat for increased comfort. Total cost for the entire project was $ 1489. 86. A cost breakdown for each specific system is provided in the report. Testing for all implemented systems was conducted and verified using the design specifications as stated in the report. All systems have passed specified design criteria...|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} levers may vary, but is usually an odd number for <b>a</b> <b>lock</b> {{that can be}} opened from {{each side of the}} door in order to provide symmetry. A minimum number of levers may be {{specified}} to provide an anticipated level of security (see 5 <b>lever</b> <b>locks</b> section).|$|R

50|$|Railway {{interlocking}} is of British origin, where numerous patents were granted. In June 1856, John Saxby {{received the}} first patent for interlocking switches and signals. In 1868, Saxby (of Saxby & Farmer) {{was awarded a}} patent for what is known today in North America as “preliminary latch locking”. Preliminary latch locking became so successful that by 1873, 13,000 mechanical <b>locking</b> <b>levers</b> were employed on the London and North Western Railway alone.|$|R
50|$|Some {{connector}} housings {{are designed with}} locking mechanisms to prevent inadvertent disconnection or poor environmental sealing. Locking mechanism designs include <b>locking</b> <b>levers</b> of various sorts, screw locking, and toggle or bayonet locking. Depending on application requirements, housings with locking mechanisms may be tested under various environmental simulations that include physical shock and vibration, water spray, dust, etc. to ensure {{the integrity of the}} electrical connection and housing seals.|$|R
50|$|The LPS {{telescopic}} sight propriety mount is adjustable for {{tension on the}} LPS rifle's side rail. This side rail is a Warsaw Pact rail similar in design to the mounting used for Russian SVD rifles and PSO-1 optical sights and positions the {{telescopic sight}} axis {{to the left side}} in relation to the receiver and bore center axis.The Warsaw Pact mount has a castle nut that screws {{into the bottom of the}} <b>locking</b> <b>lever.</b> The spring-loaded portion of the clamp has to be pressed down to tighten or loosen the castle nut as needed.The scope can be easily removed from the receiver of the rifle by swinging the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> open, then sliding the scope mount to the rear. This allows easy access to the receiver cover which needs to be removed for cleaning.Due to the offset to the left and the relative height of the mounting, the PSL iron sights can be used with a LPS scope mounted, though the positioning of the scope’s optical center axis may not be comfortable to all shooters.|$|R
50|$|The Airphibian {{took the}} {{approach}} of converting from an aircraft to a roadable vehicle by a conversion process that left aircraft sections behind during road use. The process consisted of removing a three-bladed propeller and placing it on a hook {{on the side of}} the fuselage, cranking down support casters, and disengaging <b>lock</b> <b>levers</b> connecting the flight unit to the road unit. The wing and aft fuselage are detached for road use.|$|R
50|$|Higher {{security}} <b>lever</b> <b>locks</b> (such as the 5 lever) {{usually have}} notches {{cut into the}} levers. These catch the locking bolt and prevent it from moving if picking is attempted (similar to the security pins in <b>a</b> pin tumbler <b>lock).</b>|$|R
