5|$|Although {{they grow}} {{naturally}} on deep sandy soils, the species has proved adaptable to other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage. Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in full sun, although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts. Heavy pruning after flowering reinvigorates {{the plants and}} promotes more profuse flowering in the next season. Waratah blooms are highly susceptible to damage from wind, <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> some protection from prevailing winds. Waratah blooms attract birds to the garden. The species is readily propagated from fresh seed, but cultivars must be reproduced from cuttings to remain true-to-type.|$|E
5|$|Asia League {{was created}} {{primarily}} {{for the development of}} hockey in Asia. The league allows teams to hire a small number of imports to play on the team in order to even out strength as well as increase the level of competitiveness in the league. Playing against more skilled foreign players will allow players from the participating countries to increase their skills <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> having some more experienced players on their teams. China is allowed the most imports while the experienced Japanese teams are allowed the fewest. As part of some sponsorship deals China was provided western players from the San Jose Sharks, and the two Chinese teams were provided Swedish players when the Nordic Vikings were active in the league.|$|E
5|$|Many SCI {{patients}} have received misinformation {{about the effects}} of their injury on their sexual function <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> education about it. Although sexual education shortly after injury is known to be helpful and desired, it is frequently missing in rehabilitation settings; a common complaint from those who go through rehabilitation programs is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality. Longer-term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important, yet sexuality {{is one of the most}} often neglected areas in long-term SCI rehabilitation, particularly for women. Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it. Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters since people may be uncomfortable with or unready for the subject. Many patients wait for providers to broach the topic even if they do want the information.|$|E

He has been called a central player opposing new restrictions of international scientific exchanges of people and ideas after the attacks. He later was responsible for reorienting the nation's space policy after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, and played an important part in the nation's re-entry into the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor program.

5|$|Progeny of {{two parents}} of {{different}} breeds are termed F1 hybrids, F1 crosses or first crosses. F1 hybrids generally have an extremely uniform phenotype <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> hybrid vigour. These advantages are {{observed in the}} breeding {{of a wide variety}} of animals and plants, and arise because progeny inherit one of each paired gene from each parent. When both parents are homozygous for different variants of genes (known as alleles), which is likely to be the case when a breed has been developed and selected over several generations, progeny will inherit both gene variants present in the parents. The F1 hybrid progeny will then be heterozygous for each gene variant, which in turn increases the likelihood that the genes will code for an optimal protein or enzyme. This is the genetic basis of hybrid vigour. While many gene variants have effects that are of little consequence to beef production, a few, such as the myostatin variants found in different cattle breeds, have a major effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} these four territories to be {{incorporated}} into Imerina was Fanongoavana, then a principality ruled by Andriampanarivofomanjaka. Continual threats to his kingdom's security led Andriampanarivofomanjaka to secretly travel to the Rova of Antananarivo to pledge submission to Andriamasinavalona. He was accompanied by seven advisers who eloquently communicated their master's willingness to acknowledge Andriamasinavalona as his king. Andriamasinavalona accepted this offer and sealed the union of their territories by marrying Andriampanarivofomanjaka to his sister, Ranavalontsimitovy. Andriampanarivofomanjaka then returned to his realm, announced the union to his people, and then spoke {{with the leaders of}} the neighboring Bezanozano people to successfully persuade them to join the kingdom <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> Andriamasinavalona's protection.|$|E

25|$|Obviously {{this system}} is not viable in a {{capitalist}} society, since once the owners automate their factories, they just sack all their workers without pay and let them starve while the machines do all the work, filling their own pockets with gold from the profit.

25|$|What {{was unique}} about the Zisapels' {{business}} philosophy was that each company would operate independently, without a holding company, {{but all of}} the companies would be guided by them under a collective strategic umbrella. Companies may cooperate in the development of their solutions, engage in joint marketing activities <b>and</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> a common management structure. This decentralized business philosophy was designed to maximize the advantages inherent in smaller business units, such as flexibility, entrepreneurial spirit and management focus. As a result, since 1984, when the RAD Group came into being, it has spawned more than 185 companies, 8 IPOs and 19 mergers and acquisitions.|$|E
