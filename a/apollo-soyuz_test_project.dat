5|$|Glynn Stephen Lunney (born November 27, 1936) is {{a retired}} NASA engineer. An {{employee}} of NASA since its creation in 1958, Lunney was a flight director during the Gemini and Apollo programs, and was on duty during historic {{events such as the}} Apollo 11 lunar ascent and the pivotal hours of the Apollo 13 crisis. At the end of the Apollo program, he became manager of the <b>Apollo-Soyuz</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Project,</b> the first collaboration in spaceflight between the United States and the Soviet Union.

5|$|The primary {{objectives}} of STS-71, launched on June 27, {{called for the}} Space Shuttle Atlantis to rendezvous and perform the first docking between an American Space Shuttle and the station. On June 29, Atlantis successfully docked with Mir, becoming the first US spacecraft to dock with a Russian spacecraft since the <b>Apollo-Soyuz</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Project</b> in 1975. Atlantis delivered Cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Nikolai Budarin, who would form the expedition EO-19 crew, and retrieved Astronaut Norman Thagard and Cosmonauts Vladimir Dezhurov and Gennady Strekalov of the expedition EO-18 crew. Atlantis also carried out on-orbit joint US-Russian life sciences investigations aboard a Spacelab module and performed a logistical resupply of the station.|$|E

25|$|Shepard {{became the}} first American in space by making a {{suborbital}} flight in May 1961. He went on to fly in the Apollo program and became the only Mercury astronaut {{to walk on the}} Moon. Gus Grissom, who became the second American in space, also participated in the Gemini and Apollo programs, but died in January 1967 during a pre-launch test for Apollo 1. Glenn {{became the first}} American to orbit the Earth in February 1962, then quit NASA and went into politics, serving as a US Senator from 1974 to 1999, and returned to space in 1998 as a Payload Specialist aboard STS-95. Deke Slayton was grounded in 1962, but remained with NASA and was appointed Chief Astronaut at the beginning of Project Gemini. He remained in the position of senior astronaut, in charge of space crew flight assignments among many other responsibilities, until towards the end of Project Apollo, when he resigned and began training to fly on the <b>Apollo-Soyuz</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Project</b> in 1975, which he successfully did. Gordon Cooper became the last to fly in Mercury and made its longest flight, and also flew a Gemini mission. Carpenter's Mercury flight was his only trip into space. Schirra flew the third orbital Mercury mission, and then flew a Gemini mission. Three years later, he commanded the first manned Apollo mission, becoming the only person to fly in all three of those programs.|$|E
500|$|The {{origins of}} the Shuttle–Mir Program {{can be traced back}} to the <b>Apollo–Soyuz</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Project,</b> that {{resulted}} in a joint US/Soviet mission during the détente period of the Cold War and the docking between a US Apollo spacecraft and a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft in 1975. This was followed by the talks between NASA and Intercosmos in the 1970s about a [...] "Shuttle-Salyut" [...] program to fly Space Shuttle missions to a Salyut space station, with later talks in the 1980s even considering flights of the future Soviet shuttles from the Buran programme to a future US space station – this [...] "Shuttle-Salyut" [...] program never materialized however during the existence of the Soviet Intercosmos program.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, {{while still}} a flight director, Lunney was {{selected}} {{as one of the}} members of a NASA delegation to the Soviet Union, which was to discuss the possibility of cooperation between the two countries in the field of manned spaceflight. [...] "For me it was out of the clear blue sky", said Lunney, who was told of the plans while at a conference in early October. [...] "I did not know anything about [...] until that time." [...] The trip took place in late October. While in Moscow, Lunney gave a presentation to Soviet engineers on the techniques that NASA used for orbital rendezvous, and on the compromises that would have to be made in order to achieve a rendezvous between American and Soviet spacecraft. The technical agreement that he helped to draft laid the groundwork for the mission which was to become the <b>Apollo-Soyuz</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Project</b> (ASTP). It was intended to be a joint mission, whose highlight was to be a docking between an American Apollo spacecraft and a Soviet Soyuz.|$|E

40|$|The {{choice of}} a {{software}} testing technique can have severe implications on the quality and efficiency of a <b>testing</b> <b>project.</b> One of the fundamental steps in managing a <b>testing</b> <b>project</b> should be selecting an effective testing technique. This paper discusses a methodology {{that can be used}} for experimentally assessing the effectiveness of two or more testing techniques in practice. The work should help quality managers and related researchers to learn how two or more testing techniques can be compared experimentally when one needs to choose an effective testing technique for a project. The primary motivation behind this paper is to advocate selecting an effective testing technique in practice in <b>testing</b> <b>projects</b> and providing a framework that can be readily adopted in practical <b>testing</b> <b>projects.</b> The <b>testing</b> techniques used to demonstrate the above are trivial in practice, and we did not intend to report the results of their comparisons here...|$|R

500|$|Apollo {{ran from}} 1961 to 1972, {{with the first}} manned flight in 1968. It {{achieved}} its goal of manned lunar landing, despite the major setback of a 1967 Apollo 1 cabin fire that killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the Apollo 13 landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which damaged the CSM's propulsion and life support. The crew returned to Earth safely by using the Lunar Module as a [...] "lifeboat" [...] for these functions. Apollo used Saturn family rockets as launch vehicles, which were also used for an Apollo Applications Program, which consisted of Skylab, a space station that supported three manned missions in 1973–74, and the <b>Apollo–Soyuz</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Project,</b> a joint Earth orbit mission with the Soviet Union in 1975.|$|E

40|$|How {{to provide}} {{cost-effective}} strategies for Software Testing {{has been one}} of the research focuses in Software Engineering for a long time. Many researchers in Software Engineering have addressed the effectiveness and quality metric of Software Testing, and many interesting results have been obtained. However, one issue of paramount importance in software testing — the intrinsic imprecise and uncertain relationships within testing metrics — is left unaddressed. To this end, a new quality and effectiveness measurement based on fuzzy logic is proposed. Related issues like the software quality features and fuzzy reasoning for <b>test</b> <b>project</b> similarity measurement are discussed, which can deal with quality and effectiveness consistency between different <b>test</b> <b>projects.</b> Experiments were conducted to verify the proposed measurement using real data from actual software <b>testing</b> <b>projects.</b> Experimental results show that the proposed fuzzy logic based metrics is effective and efficient to measure and evaluate the quality and effectiveness of <b>test</b> <b>projects.</b> <br /...|$|R
