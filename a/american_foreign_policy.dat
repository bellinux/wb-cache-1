5|$|Kennan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to perform his job in Belgrade. President Josip Broz Tito and his foreign minister, Koča Popović, began to suspect that Kennedy would adopt an anti-Yugoslav policy during his term. Tito and Popović considered Kennedy's decision to observe Captive Nations Week as an indication that the United States would assist anticommunist liberation efforts in Yugoslavia. Tito also believed that the CIA and the Pentagon were the true directors of <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> Kennan attempted to restore Tito's confidence in the <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> establishment but his efforts were compromised by a pair of diplomatic blunders, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and the U-2 spy incident.|$|E

5|$|By 2003, many Turks {{had come}} to see <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> in the region as a threat. Matters were not helped by the {{election}} in 2002 of the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The election of the AKP led to an immediate increase in tensions with America, especially after the Parliament's decision not to send any Turkish troops to Iraq further eroded US-Turkish relations. 70% of the parliament members were Justice and Development Party members.|$|E
5|$|Due to Turkish {{government}} {{fears of}} a terrorist attack, security measures during the summit were tight.

5|$|From {{an early}} age, Shoup was molded by the {{progressive}} ideas of Indiana politicians, sympathizing with rural progressives {{fighting against the}} interests of big businesses. He developed an anti-imperialist attitude, and his skepticism about <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> influenced by his small-town background, made him an outspoken opponent of the unnecessary use of military force. He felt the use of troops for economic or imperialist consideration was wrong, a viewpoint he would carry for his entire career.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, a tight-knit group of neo-conservatives have had a {{significant}} impact in the carving out of <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policies,</b> especially those concerning the Middle East.

40|$|Abstract As China’s economy grows, {{scholars}} {{of international relations}} increasingly ask what implications this growth {{will have on the}} World. One frequently asked question is how the relationship between the US and China will develop, as this relationship is believed to be of paramount importance for the future stability of East Asia. As theories of international relations - as well as of foreign policymaking - make different assumptions about the impact of public opinion on <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policies,</b> they tend to arrive at quite different conclusions when attempting to predict the future of Sino-American relations. Accordingly, this thesis asks whether American public opinion does have an impact on <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> towards China. After arguing that the theory of neoclassical realism {{can be used as a}} theoretical framework and a starting point for studying public opinion, I hypothesize that puclic opinion, Chinese policies and prior American policies towards China all contribute to American China-policies. Then, I go on to discuss how the analysis can overcome methodological challenges. I thereby apply a simple, quantitative content analysis to obtain data for the public opinion (as perceived by policymakers). By using vector autoregressive models, I am able to model the relationship between the hypothesized factors statistically, in spite of endogeneity, finding that there is – indeed - a statistically significant impact of American public opinion on <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> toward China. Furthermore, it is found that American policies are influenced by Chinese policies towards the US, as well as by prior policies towards China...|$|R
5|$|In a {{prepared}} speech in January 2010, Clinton drew analogies between the Iron Curtain {{and the free}} and unfree Internet.

5|$|The Navy's {{experience}} in this war was encouraging in that it had won but also cautionary in that the enemy {{had one of the}} weakest of the world's modern fleets. Also, the Manila Bay attack was extremely risky in which the American ships could have incurred severe damage or run out of supplies, as they were 7,000 miles from the nearest American harbor. That would {{have a profound effect on}} Navy strategy and <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> for next several decades.|$|E
5|$|After a year, Matlock was {{promoted}} to Third Secretary in the Political Section. <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> {{with regard to the}} Soviet Union, known as containment, had been articulated in 1947 by George F. Kennan, who was later to become a good friend of Matlock’s. The American policy was basically to contain the spread of Communism, in the expectation that it would eventually collapse of internal contradictions. This did not prevent discussions between the Superpowers. In June 1961, President John F. Kennedy and First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev met in Vienna, and in December the United Nations General Assembly approved a draft joint resolution on principles for negotiating disarmament. This period also saw the beginnings of U.S. - U.S.S.R. cultural exchanges, notably the visit of poet Robert Frost to Moscow.|$|E

5|$|During a June 2007 {{visit to}} the {{predominantly}} Muslim Albania, Bush was greeted enthusiastically. Albania {{has a population of}} 2.8million, has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and the country's government is highly supportive of <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> A huge image of the President was hung {{in the middle of the}} capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and American flags while a local street was named after him. A shirt-sleeved statue of Bush was unveiled in Fushë-Krujë, a few kilometers northwest of Tirana. The Bush administration's support for the independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to the Albanians, has troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|The US media's {{links to}} Thảo {{have been the}} source of {{historical}} debate. The journalists' reporting of Diệm's authoritarian rule, military failures, and attacks on Buddhists shifted American public opinion and put pressure on Washington to withdraw support for the Ngô family and seek a change of leadership. William Prochnau felt that the fall of Diệm was the biggest influence of the media on <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> in over six decades. Thảo and Phạm Xuân Ẩn had {{been the source of}} much of the media's information. Conservative revisionist historians have accused the media of bringing down Diệm by publishing reports that, according to them, were based on false data disseminated by communist propagandists to unfairly malign Diệm's rule, which they claim was effective and fair towards the Buddhist majority.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{after the}} war, Robert McNamara stated that by spring 1967 {{he and other}} civilians in the {{administration}} had become convinced that both Rolling Thunder and the ground war in South Vietnam were not working. McNamara claimed that he and others within the administration continuously opposed the Joint Chief's recommendations for an increased tempo of bombing and the loosening of target restrictions. The generals found themselves on the horns of a dilemma of their own making. They continuously claimed that the campaign was working, yet they also had to continuously demand greater latitude {{in order to make}} the campaign succeed. The limited goals entailed in <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> and the military's goal of total victory were simply not reconcilable. The great conundrum had then become how to defeat North Vietnam without defeating North Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Political realism {{formed the}} basis of Kennan's work as a diplomat and {{historian}} and remains relevant to the debate over <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> which since the 19th century has been characterized by a shift from the Founding Fathers' realist school to the idealistic or Wilsonian school of international relations. According to the realist tradition, security is based on the principle of a balance of power, whereas Wilsonianism (considered impractical by realists) relies on morality as the sole determining factor in statecraft. According to the Wilsonians the spread of democracy abroad as a foreign policy is important and morals are valid universally. During the Presidency of Bill Clinton, American diplomacy represented the Wilsonian school {{to such a degree that}} those in favor of the realism likened President Clinton's policies to social work. According to Kennan, whose concept of American diplomacy was based on the realist approach, such moralism without regard to the realities of power and the national interest is self-defeating and will result in the decrease of American power.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this article}} we propose an {{alternative}} theoretical path to study contemporary Latin <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policies,</b> evoking the notion of 'public policy cycle' to explain how democratic regimes {{in the region have}} been able to expand their autonomy over time. For that, we will first identify the sources of a given country's <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> both at home and abroad, as well as its decision-making and implementation mechanisms. With regard to methodology, by replacing sheer deductivism for some inductivism, this approach also innovates in allowing more rigorous comparative politics and, consequently, new general theories about Latin American politics and policies...|$|R
