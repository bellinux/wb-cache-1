Changes in precipitation and temperature associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation dominate the Bow streamflow record. Higher snowfall, lower mean temperatures, and greater <b>annual</b> <b>discharges</b> occur during the “cool” PDO phase (1947 - 1976) with lower snowfall, higher mean temperatures, and lower <b>annual</b> <b>discharges</b> during the “warm” (1925 - 1946, 1977 - 2005) phases. Any long-term linear trends in the Bow record are masked by these multidecadal trends. The Athabasca record is too short to compare to the PDO but available data show patterns similar to the Bow. Differences in percentage glacier cover result in differences in median flow dates ranging from (June 29) on the Miette (0. 2 % glacier cover) to July 28 on the proglacial Sunwapta River (61 % glacier cover).

40|$|Region: East Africa. Focus: A {{review of}} {{catchment}} studies (n= 37) conducted in East Africa evaluating {{the impacts of}} Land Use and Land Cover Changes (LULCC) on discharge, surface runoff, and low flows. New hydrological insights: Forest cover loss is accompanied by increased stream discharges and surface runoff. No significant difference in stream discharge is observed between bamboo and pine plantation catchments, and between cultivated and tea plantation catchments. Trend analyses show that despite forest cover loss, 63 % of the watersheds show non-significant changes in <b>annual</b> <b>discharges</b> while 31 % show increasing trends. Half of the watersheds show non-significant trends in wet season flows and low flows while 35 % reveal decreasing trends in low flows. Modeling studies estimate that forest cover loss increases <b>annual</b> <b>discharges</b> and surface runoff by 16 ± 5. 5 % and 45 ± 14 %, respectively. Peak flows increased by a mean of 10 ± 2. 8 % while low flows decreased by a mean of 7 ± 5. 3 %. Increased forest cover decreases <b>annual</b> <b>discharges</b> and surface runoff by 13 ± 1. 9 % and 25 ± 5 %, respectively. Weak correlations between forest cover and runoff (r= 0. 42, p < 0. 05), mean discharge (r= 0. 63, p < 0. 05) and peak discharge (r= 0. 67, p < 0. 05) indicate that forest cover alone is not an accurate predictor of hydrological fluxes in East African catchments. The variability in these results supports the need for long-term field monitoring to better understand catchment responses and to improve the calibration of currently used simulation models...|$|R

50|$|Magnitude and {{frequency}} method. For large basins, where unit hydrograph {{might not be}} useful and reliable, the magnitude {{and frequency}} method {{is used to calculate}} the probability of recurrence of large flows based on records of past years’ flows. In United States, these records are maintained by the Hydrological Division of the U.S. Geological Survey for most rivers and large streams. For a basin with an area of 5000 square miles or more, the river system is typically gauged at five to ten places. The data from each gauging station apply to the part of the basin upstream that location. Given several decades of peak <b>annual</b> <b>discharges</b> for a river, limited projections can be made to estimate the size of some large flow that has not been experienced during the period of record. The technique involves projecting the curve (graph line) formed when peak <b>annual</b> <b>discharges</b> are plotted against their respective recurrence intervals. However, in most cases the curve bends strongly, making it difficult to plot a projection accurately. This problem can be overcome by plotting the discharge and/or recurrence interval data on logarithmic graph paper. Once the plot is straightened, a line can be ruled drawn through the points. A projection can then be made by extending the line beyond the points and then reading the appropriate discharge for the recurrence interval in question.|$|R

[...] Humboldt State University: In Natural Resources, Watershed Management, 2012 Accurate modeling of forest hydrology regimes (i. e. hourly, daily and <b>annual</b> <b>discharges,</b> peak flows) requires detailed datasets to define the physiography, land cover, and meteorological variables. In this study, I used the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model to simulate hourly stream discharge for 6 hydrologic years in a small, coastal watershed (463 ha), using meteorological data sourced from a nearby National Weather Service station, and a combination of remote sensing and timber harvest records to prepare model inputs. During the model simulation period, approximately 20 percent (100 ha) of the basin was harvested. I calibrated and validated the model with continuous discharge measurements made in the study area, and used the Nash-Sutcliffe Model Efficiency, the coefficient of determination, and percent bias metrics to evaluate model success at simulating hourly, mean daily, and total <b>annual</b> <b>discharges.</b> Simulated <b>annual</b> <b>discharges</b> over the six year period display a 2 percent to - 23 percent bias compared to observed values. Nash / Sutcliffe and coefficient of determination metrics iv were evaluated for hourly and daily discharges, with the daily metrics improving two percent to 10 percent over hourly metrics. Daily Nash / Sutcliffe values ranged from 0. 58 to 0. 85 and daily coefficient of determination values show the greatest success ranging from 0. 82 to 0. 94. The mean absolute error for hourly discharges ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 1 cubic meters per second and showed a slightly better performance when evaluated at the daily level. Daily mean peak flows display varying degrees of scatter year to year, with Root Mean Square Errors ranging from 0. 35 to 0. 68 cms. Poor model performance can be somewhat explained by the uncertainty in the meteorological and solar record (out-ofbasin observations) and limited soil data. The model???s performance could be improved with either the inclusion of preferential flow pathways (model coding), detailed soil data (spatial variability of soil properties), or in-basin meteorological observations.
