5|$|The Vedette was {{manufactured}} in Poissy until 1961 and the <b>Ariane</b> until 1963. After that, production continued in Brazil, where the Vedette finally {{evolved into the}} Simca Esplanada, following Simca's takeover by Chrysler.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, the United Kingdom is {{the only}} country to have {{successfully}} developed and then abandoned a satellite launch capability. All other countries that have developed such a capability have retained it either through their own space programme or, in the case of France, through its involvement in the <b>Ariane</b> programme.|$|E
5|$|The Simca Vedette {{is a large}} car, {{manufactured}} from 1954 to 1961 by the French automaker Simca, {{at their}} factory in Poissy, France. It was marketed with different model names according to trim and equipment levels. The Vedette was Simca's largest model {{at that time and}} it spawned a more economical version, the Simca <b>Ariane.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{reusable}} Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) {{launch vehicle}} was {{planned to be}} implemented about 15 years after the addition of LFBBs to <b>Ariane</b> 5. However, only a preliminary analysis of TSTO was completed. The proposed configuration consisted of two boosters with retractable wings attached to the external fuel tank, and a reusable orbiter with fixed wings carrying payload on top of it. During geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) missions, an additional, expandable upper stage would be used.|$|E
5|$|Liquid Fly-back Booster (LFBB) was a German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) project {{concept to}} develop a {{reusable}} liquid rocket booster for <b>Ariane</b> 5 in order to significantly reduce a high cost of space transportation and increase environmental friendliness. LFBB would replace existing solid rocket boosters, providing main thrust during the liftoff. Once separated, two winged boosters would perform an atmospheric entry, fly back autonomously to the French Guiana, and land horizontally on the airport like an airplane.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool Skeptics in the Pub holds two {{meetings}} a month, one {{of which}} is a social event and the other of which features a guest speaker. Guest speakers have included <b>Ariane</b> Sherine, Simon Singh, David Aaronovitch, Evan Harris, Elizabeth Pisani, Brian Deer, Jon Ronson, Stephen Law, David Nutt, Mark Stevenson, Mark Lynas and Robert Llewellyn, among others. Topics covered vary widely and include health care, science, atheism, the paranormal and supernatural, psychics, politics and psychology.|$|E
5|$|The Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) had a {{proposed}} launch date in 2020, {{and was a}} joint NASA and ESA proposal for exploration of many of Jupiter's moons including Ganymede. In February 2009 {{it was announced that}} ESA and NASA had given this mission priority ahead of the Titan Saturn System Mission. EJSM consisted of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter, the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter, and possibly a JAXA-led Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter. ESA's contribution faced funding competition from other ESA projects, but on 2 May 2012 the European part of the mission, renamed Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), obtained a L1 launch slot in 2022 with an <b>Ariane</b> 5 in the ESA's Cosmic Vision science programme. The spacecraft will orbit Ganymede and conduct multiple flyby investigations of Callisto and Europa.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a Hubble {{successor}} materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which {{culminated in}} {{plans for the}} James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble. Very different from a scaled-up Hubble, {{it is designed to}} operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 Lagrangian point, where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened. It is not engineered to be fully serviceable (such as replaceable instruments), but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft. A main scientific goal of JWST is to observe the most distant objects in the universe, beyond the reach of existing instruments. It is expected to detect stars in the early Universe approximately 280 million years older than stars HST now detects. The telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency since 1996, and is planned for launch on an <b>Ariane</b> 5 rocket. Although JWST is primarily an infrared instrument, its coverage extends down to 600nm wavelength light, or roughly orange in the visible spectrum. A typical human eye can see to about 750nm wavelength light, so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands, including orange and red light.|$|E
25|$|As the {{successor}} of ELDO, ESA has also constructed rockets for scientific and commercial payloads. <b>Ariane</b> 1, launched in 1979, carried mostly commercial payloads into orbit from 1984 onward. The next {{two versions of}} the <b>Ariane</b> rocket were intermediate stages {{in the development of a}} more advanced launch system, the <b>Ariane</b> 4, which operated between 1988 and 2003 and established ESA as the world leader in commercial space launches in the 1990s. Although the succeeding <b>Ariane</b> 5 experienced a failure on its first flight, it has since firmly established itself within the heavily competitive commercial space launch market with 56 successful launches as of September 2011. The successor launch vehicle of <b>Ariane</b> 5, the <b>Ariane</b> 6, is under development and is envisioned to enter service in the 2020s.|$|E
25|$|Starting in November 2016, {{deployment}} of the last twelve satellites will use a modified <b>Ariane</b> 5 launcher, named <b>Ariane</b> 5 ES, capable of placing four Galileo satellites into orbit per launch.|$|E
25|$|On June 5, 1989 Superbird-A, {{the second}} private {{communications}} satellite of Japan was launched aboard an <b>Ariane</b> 44L along DFS Kopernikus-1. On February 22, 1990 Superbird-B was lost when the <b>Ariane</b> 44LP {{that should have}} orbited it along BS-2X failed during launch. Superbird-B1 was completed in just 19 months and successfully launched on February 26, 1992 also aboard an <b>Ariane</b> 44L. The last of the initial batch, Superbird-A1 was launched on December 1 of the same year, thus completing {{the first phase of}} deployment of the SCC fleet.|$|E
25|$|Aussat 3 was {{launched}} from Guiana Space Centre by an <b>Ariane</b> 3.|$|E
25|$|N-STAR a was {{successfully}} launched aboard an <b>Ariane</b> 44P on August 29, 1995. Its twin, N-STAR b, launched on February 5, 1996, also aboard an <b>Ariane</b> 44P. The satellite telephone service was operational in March 1996. On March 2000, the packet communications service was introduced. On March 2000, JSAT received the NTT Communications {{interest in the}} N-STAR a and N-STAR b.|$|E
25|$|On August 6, 2011, JCSAT-110R/BSAT-3c and its launch {{companion}} Astra 1N {{were successfully}} put in orbit by an <b>Ariane</b> 5 ECA. On May 15, 2012, again on an <b>Ariane</b> 5 ECA, JCSAT-13 and Vinasat-2 were launched into orbit. After the launch success, JCAST-13 was renamed JCSAT-4B. After reaching the 124°East, it was commissioned into service on July 10, replacing JCSAT-4A.|$|E
25|$|France was {{the third}} space power (see Diamant) to achieve access to space(after the USSR and USA), sharing {{technologies}} with Europe to develop the <b>Ariane</b> launcher family. Commercial competition in space is fierce, so launch services must be tailored to space operators’ needs. The new versions of <b>Ariane</b> 5 can launch large satellites or perform dual launches while the Vega and Soyuz-2 are small and medium-lift launchers.|$|E
25|$|D2 was {{successfully}} launched from the Guiana Space Centre by an <b>Ariane</b> 5 GS on 2007-10-05 at 22:02 UTC.|$|E
25|$|ESA's <b>Ariane</b> 1, 2, 3 and 4 {{launchers}} (the last {{of which}} was ESA's long-time workhorse) have been retired.|$|E
25|$|An <b>Ariane</b> 44L {{successfully}} launched JCSAT-8 on March 28, 2002 from Guiana Space Centre. Once successfully deployed, it {{was renamed}} JCSAT-2A.|$|E
25|$|Satellites GSAT-207 (Antonianna), GSAT-212 (Lisa) , GSAT-213 (Kimberley), GSAT-214 (Tijmen) were {{successfully}} launched from Kourou, French Guiana, on 17 November 2016 on an <b>Ariane</b> 5 ES.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1990s, {{particularly}} {{following the}} <b>Ariane</b> 5 Flight 501 disaster, interest in automated aids to debugging rose, such as static code analysis by abstract interpretation.|$|E
25|$|Kourou's {{economy is}} largely {{dominated}} by the CSG, from which the European <b>Ariane</b> rockets are launched, {{as well as the}} Russian Soyuz and the Italian Vega rockets.|$|E
25|$|D1 was {{successfully}} launched by an <b>Ariane</b> 5 ECA on 13 October 2006 at 20:56 UTC. It {{was the first}} satellite to sign contract for Launch Services Alliance mission assurance.|$|E
25|$|The {{satellite}} {{was launched}} on February 8, 1985, by an <b>Ariane</b> model rocket from the Kourou launch base in French Guiana {{and placed in}} a geostationary orbit over Brazilian territory.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Ariane</b> 5 rocket is ESA's primary launcher. It {{has been}} in service since 1997 and {{replaced}} <b>Ariane</b> 4. Two different variants are currently in use. The heaviest and most used version, the , delivers two communications satellites of up to 10 tonnes into GTO. It failed during its first test flight in 2002, but has since made 71 consecutive successful flights (as of March 2016). The other version, , was used to launch the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) to the International Space Station (ISS) and {{will be used to}} launch four Galileo navigational satellites at a time.|$|E
25|$|On 27 March 2014, {{he climbed}} the Tour <b>Ariane</b> outside Paris in 45 minutes. Onlookers and police {{gathered}} to watch his climb. He was arrested by police and later released without being charged.|$|E
25|$|Sky Muster I (NBN-Co 1A) was {{launched}} on 1 October 2015 from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana, South America, alongside Argentina's ARSAT-2, on an <b>Ariane</b> 5ECA rocket. It became operational in April 2016.|$|E
25|$|On February 8, 2011 it was {{reported}} that Alliant Techsystems and Astrium proposed to use Ares I's first stage with the second stage from the <b>Ariane</b> 5 to form a new rocket named Liberty.|$|E
25|$|On August 21, 2009, an <b>Ariane</b> 5 ECA {{successfully}} orbited JCSAT-12 {{along with}} Optus D3. Upon reaching orbit, JCSAT-12 was renamed JCSAT-RA, which functions as an on-orbit backup. On November 30 {{of the same}} year, a Zenit-3SLB successfully launched Intelsat-15/JCSAT-85.|$|E
25|$|On November 1, 2005, SCC orders {{its first}} {{satellite}} {{to be built}} in Japan, the Superbird-7 by MELCO. It was successfully launched along AMC-21 by an <b>Ariane</b> 5 ECA on August 14, 2008, at which time it was renamed as Superbird-C2.|$|E
25|$|In September 2014, ESA {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with Sierra Nevada Corporation for co-operation in Dream Chaser project. Further studies on the Dream Chaser for European Utilization or DC4EU project were funded, including the feasibility of launching a Europeanized Dream Chaser onboard <b>Ariane</b> 5.|$|E
25|$|Verfolgt und gejagt (Nazi Hunter: The Beate Klarsfeld Story) – TV-Film, USA, Frankreich, 1986, ca. 100 Min., Regie: Michael Lindsay-Hogg, Produktion: Films <b>Ariane,</b> SFP, TF 1, Brent Walker TV, Silver Chalice, Orion-TV, mit Farrah Fawcett als Beate Klarsfeld und Tom Conti als Serge Klarsfeld.|$|E
25|$|ESA has a {{fleet of}} {{different}} launch vehicles in service with which it competes in all sectors of the launch market. ESA's fleet consists of three major rocket designs: <b>Ariane</b> 5, Soyuz-2 and Vega. Rocket launches are carried out by Arianespace, which has 23 shareholders representing the industry that manufactures the <b>Ariane</b> 5 as well as CNES, at ESA's Guiana Space Centre. Because many communication satellites have equatorial orbits, launches from French Guiana are able to take larger payloads into space than from spaceports at higher latitudes. In addition, equatorial launches give spacecraft an extra 'push' of nearly 500m/s due to the higher rotational velocity of the Earth at the equator compared to near the Earth's poles where rotational velocity approaches zero.|$|E
25|$|The 2009 Indoor season saw Vlašić {{posting a}} world indoor lead of 2,05 m in Karlsruhe, equalling her own {{national}} indoor {{record in the}} process. However she failed to earn a medal at the European Indoor Championships in Torino, finishing fifth. Germany's <b>Ariane</b> Friedrich won the gold medal.|$|E
25|$|Vlašić's {{season ended}} {{when she was}} again beaten on countback in the final leg of the ÅF Golden League series, which ended her chances of winning the $1,000,000 jackpot. Having won the {{previous}} five Golden League events, she finished the Memorial Van Damme meeting in second place behind <b>Ariane</b> Friedrich.|$|E
25|$|On 1 August 2010 Vlašić won {{her first}} European title with 2,03 m, equalling the {{championship}} record set by Belgian's Tia Hellebaut and Bulgaria's Venelina Veneva-Mateeva {{four years earlier}} at the 2006 edition in Gothenburg. She beat Sweden's Emma Green (silver) and Germany's <b>Ariane</b> Friedrich (bronze), both jumping 2,01 m.|$|E
25|$|On 1995, SCC {{obtained}} {{a license to}} offer communication services in the international market and thus became a regional operator. On April 6, 1998, SCC ordered a second satellite from Boeing, Superbird-4. On February 18, 2000 Superbird-4 was orbited by an <b>Ariane</b> 44LP, at chich point it was renamed as Superbird-B2.|$|E
