60|$|The rosebud {{was destined}} never to bloom for Edward Fane. His {{mother was a}} rich and haughty dame with all the aristocratic prejudices of colonial times. She scorned Rose Grafton's humble {{parentage}} and caused her son to break his faith, though, had she let him choose, he would have prized his Rosebud above the richest diamond. The lovers parted, and have seldom met again. Both may have visited the same mansions, {{but not at the}} same time, for one was bidden to the festal hall and the other to the sick-chamber; he was the guest of Pleasure and Prosperity, and she of Anguish. Rose, after their separation, was long secluded within the dwelling of Mr. Toothaker, whom she married with the revengeful hope of breaking her false lover's heart. She went to her bridegroom's arms with bitterer tears, they say, than young girls ought to shed at the threshold of the bridal-chamber. Yet, though her husband's head was getting gray and his heart had been chilled with an <b>autumnal</b> <b>frost,</b> Rose soon began to love him, and wondered at her own conjugal affection. He was all she had to love; there were no children.|$|E

Yet, only {{a few studies have}} addressed the spatial and temporal localization of plant INA, how it is regulated and what its functional roles are. In our previous study (Kishimoto et al., 2014), we revised a test tube method and developed a highly reproducible assay for measuring INA of plant specimens and demonstrated that high INA occurred in the cell wall fraction of wintering bark tissues of blueberry stems and corresponded well to the freezing behavior (extracellular freezing) of the stem bark. Here, we followed precisely seasonal changes in the stem INA of two blueberry cultivars and alterations in the stem INA caused by artificial incubation at various low temperatures. INA of newly developed shoots was low but increased rapidly by July when the stem became seemingly matured, then gradually increased with the maximum in October or early November just before the first <b>autumnal</b> <b>frost.</b> Following the subsequent recurrent frosts, the stem INA gradually decreased. This tendency was consistent between the two cultivars differing in the level of cold hardiness. INA in the stems of September until February was increased by incubation at 0 - 7 °C whilst decreased by freezing to lower temperatures. The in vitro results corroborate the seasonal changes in the stem INA in the field but the mechanisms remain to be investigated. The highest level of INA (expressed as the median ice nucleation temperature) observed with current year stems (7. 5 mm-long) of Woodard in October of 2010 - 2013 was - 0. 9 ∼ - 1. 0 °C when determined with 2 mL assay system (- 1. 1 ∼ - 1. 3 °C with 0. 5 mL system). This may likely be one of the highest INA of biological origins ever reported...|$|E

Time to chill: Effects of {{simulated}} {{global change}} on leaf ice nucleation temperatures of subarctic vegetation. ? American Journal of Botany, 88,(4), 628 - 633. Sponsorship: NERC New Investigators award (GR 8 / 4223) /European Union (ES 5 V-CT 910032) We investigated {{the effects of}} long-term (7 -yr) in situ CO 2 enrichment (600 ?mol/mol) and increased exposure to UV-B radiation, the latter {{an important component of}} global change at high latitudes, on the ice nucleation temperatures of leaves of several evergreen and deciduous woody ericaceous shrubs in the subarctic (68 ? N). Three (Vaccinium uliginosum, V. vitis-idaea, and Empetrum hermaphroditum) of the four species of shrubs studied showed significantly higher ice nucleation temperatures throughout the 1999 growing season in response to CO 2 enrichment and increased exposure to UV-B radiation relative to the controls. The same species also showed a strong interactive effect when both treatments were applied together. In all cases, leaves cooled to below their ice nucleation temperatures failed to survive the damage resulting from intracellular ice formation. Our results strongly suggest that future global change on a decadal time scale (atmospheric CO 2 increases and polar stratospheric O 3 destruction) will lead to increased foliage damage of subarctic vegetation by severe late spring or early <b>autumnal</b> <b>frosting</b> events. Indeed, in support of our experimental findings, there is now some evidence that increases in atmospheric CO 2 concentration over the past three to four decades may already have acted in this manner on high-elevation arboreal plants in the Swedish Scandes. The implications for vegetation modeling in a future 'greenhouse' world and palaeoclimate estimates from high-latitude plant fossils dating to the high-CO 2 environment of the Mesozoic are discussed.
