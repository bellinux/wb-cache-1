5|$|As {{the final}} game of the 19981999 regular season, the 1998 Music City Bowl gave Virginia Tech and Alabama players <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> their skills prior to the 1999 NFL Draft. Alabama had one player {{selected}} in the draft. Cornerback Fernando Bryant was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the first round with the 26th overall selection. Virginia Tech had two players taken in the draft: defensive back Pierson Prioleau (110th overall) and guard Derek G. Smith (165th overall).|$|E
5|$|As {{the final}} game of the 2008–2009 regular season, the 2009 Orange Bowl gave Virginia Tech and Cincinnati players <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> their skills before the 2009 NFL Draft. Cincinnati had six players {{selected}} in the draft. Defensive end Connor Barwin was the first Bearcats player taken. He was picked in the second round, 46th overall. He was followed by punter Kevin Huber (142nd overall), cornerback DeAngelo Smith (143rd), cornerback Brandon Underwood (187th), cornerback Mike Mickens (227th), and guard Trevor Canfield (254th). Several Cincinnati players were signed as free agents after the draft. These included defensive tackle Adam Hoppel, linebacker Corey Smith, and offensive lineman Khalil El-Amin.|$|E
5|$|At many of {{the early}} crucial battles of the Pacific, for {{instance}} Coral Sea and Midway, battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave of planes into the attack at a range of hundreds of miles. In later battles in the Pacific, battleships primarily performed shore bombardment in support of amphibious landings and provided anti-aircraft defense as escort for the carriers. Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's , which carried a main battery of nine 18-inch (46cm) guns and were designed as a principal strategic weapon, were never given <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> their potential in the decisive battleship action that figured in Japanese pre-war planning.|$|E

50|$|While {{being one}} of the top guards in Serbia and Montenegro in past few years, he never had <b>a</b> true <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> his skills in the senior {{national}} team, due to tough competition. In an interview given to Montenegrin TV station IN TV, he stated that he would play for the Montenegrin national team.|$|R
25|$|A {{few days}} later, Team USA was down by 12 {{points at the}} half, but VanDerveer {{turned it into a}} {{positive}} opportunity. It was only an exhibition game, but she used it as <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> how the team should respond if down early in an Olympic game. The USA team went on to win that game by seven points.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} to play {{the next two years}} as the third-string catcher before serving as Dave Duncan's backup in 1971. Tenace entered the 1972 season backing up Duncan, but was given <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> his abilities by being made the team's regular catcher in the post-season. Tenace took full advantage of this opportunity, excelling in the 1972 playoffs and World Series. In the 1972 American League Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers, he drove in the clinching run in Oakland's 2–1 victory in game 5; it was his only hit of the series.|$|E
25|$|He {{started the}} 195455 season {{in a similar}} fashion to the {{previous}} summer, scoring 122 in the opening match of the season against New South Wales. He scored 90 and 41 in the return match, and after making 53 in the next fixture, his steady progress was rewarded in 195455 when he was given his Test debut against England at Sydney in the Fifth Test. Australia had lost the series and this allowed selectors to give younger players <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> their skills. Unseasonal rain mean that play did not start until 2 p.m. on the fourth day.|$|E

25|$|Mumbai FC {{was officially}} founded at a grand launch in Mumbai on 27 June 2007. The club {{was created to}} provide Indian {{football}} another non-institutional club and to provide young aspiring footballers in the city <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> off their skills on a proper platform. Mumbai FC then set about their goals in which they {{wanted to build a}} strong first team, build a good youth development program which would serve as the platform in the ladder to the first-team for potential youngsters, build a good football culture in Mumbai, and develop the football infrastructure in Mumbai. The club started building their team straight away with the signing of Englishmen David Booth. The team then started making some major signings in Indian internationals Abhishek Yadav, Khalid Jamil, Noel Wilson, and Kalyan Chaubey along with potential youngsters Dane Pereira and Darren Caldeira. The team then added their first round of foreign players Felix Aboagye and James Dissiramah. The club then began their grassroots project in November 2007 with Aqueel Ansari being the head coach. Mumbai FC then participated in their first tournament, the Mumbai Football League Elite Division in 2007. Mumbai FC lost their match in the Mumbai Football League to RCF 2–1 with Dane Pereira scoring the first goal. Mumbai FC then won the first match in their history against Bengal Mumbai; in their second match, won 7–0 with Abhishek Yadav scoring four goals. The club then won their first-ever championship, the Abhijit Kadam Memorial Cup, in which Mumbai defeated then I-League club Vasco. The club then finished in second place in the Mumbai Football League Elite Division behind I-League club Mahindra United.|$|E
500|$|Gerry Anderson {{remembered that}} AP Films had never {{attempted}} to film skiing sequences previously, but judged {{the scenes of}} Penelope and Tin-Tin travelling to Olsen's lodge to be suitably realistic. Anderson himself conceived the [...] "ski thrusters" [...] that the agents use to power their ascent up the mountainside while returning to Paradise Peaks. Praising production designer Bob Bell's visuals, he opined that the episode [...] "gave our art and design departments <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> what they could really do, and they didn't let us down." ...|$|E
500|$|Robin Hester {{played by}} Benjamin Jay, was a {{teenager}} who formed a crush on Sunny and tried to ruin her relationship with Zeke. Digital Spy said Robin [...] "goes to drastic lengths to keep Zeke and Sunny apart" [...] and Holy Soap and Jay labelled him as [...] "creepy". Robin was seen trying to manipulate Sunny and he locked Zeke in a store cupboard, so he could spend time with her. Lee named the storyline with Robin as her favourite from her time in the show. She said [...] "That {{was probably the best}} storyline ever because it gave me <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> who Sunny Lee was".|$|E

500|$|Having started {{rigorous}} workouts in {{the final}} trimester of her pregnancy the year before to prepare {{for her role in}} A Few Good Men, Moore was physically fit for the photoshoot. Thus she appeared in additional nude photos within the magazine's cover story. Moore viewed the photos as <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> off the results of her workouts: [...] "I said I would get better with each baby and I have." [...] The weeklong effort also involved shots taken in Kauai, Hawaii that are included in Gair's second book, Body Painting. Moore felt she looked better on the cover at age 29 than she had in a bikini nine years earlier in Blame It on Rio.|$|E
500|$|... "Hot to the Touch" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Cole Sanchez and Rebecca Sugar, from a story {{developed}} by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. This {{was the first}} episode that Sugar and Sanchez worked on together; Sugar's previous partner Adam Muto served as the episode's creative director, and also helped clean up the episode's storyboards. Sugar was excited to get <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> how Flame Princess interacted in the Land of Ooo, because in [...] "Incendium", she was only shown inside of her lantern. The line about Finn wanting to play BMO with Flame Princess was based on Sanchez's experiences with his high school girlfriend; he reasoned that, since Finn was younger, his ultimate idea of love would be {{to sit next to}} his love interest and play video games.|$|E
500|$|In Australia, the Duke {{opened the}} first session of the Australian Parliament upon the {{creation}} of the Commonwealth of Australia. In New Zealand, he praised the military values, bravery, loyalty, and obedience to duty of New Zealanders, and the tour gave New Zealand <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> off its progress, especially in its adoption of up-to-date British standards in communications and the processing industries. The implicit goal was to advertise New Zealand's attractiveness to tourists and potential immigrants, while avoiding news of growing social tensions, by focusing the attention of the British press on a land few knew about. On his return to Britain, in a speech at London's Guildhall, George warned of [...] "the impression which seemed to prevail among [...] brethren across the seas, that the Old Country must wake up if she intends to maintain her old position of pre-eminence in her colonial trade against foreign competitors." ...|$|E
5|$|When Heikkinen was released, {{one writer}} noted that Heikkinen “was {{perhaps the biggest}} {{disappointment}} among the highly ballyhooed players who came up this season.” Brooklyn’ coach Clark noted that an “All-American man doesn’t mean a thing to us” in the NFL. Clark said: “Heikkinen weighed only 183 pounds and was pretty light for our league. He reported late and didn’t give himself <b>a</b> fair <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> me what he could do. I just didn’t think {{he was in the}} right physical shape and mental shape.|$|R

500|$|The group's {{voices are}} {{presented}} individually on the record. Savan Kotecha {{noted that the}} Backstreet Boys' late-’90s hits inspired the way he formulated One Direction's voices for the album. Composer Julian Bunetta, who worked on three of Take Me Home tracks, also tried to place emphasis on the sound of each member: [...] "The fans can tell the difference, {{but we wanted to}} make sure that when it came on the radio, the average person knew that it must be One Direction, because it’s five guys." [...] Likewise, Caramanica noted that the album's songs produced by Bunetta [...] "tend to start out with more breathing room, giving the guys <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> off vocally". The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, and commitment, in songs such as [...] "Little Things," [...] "Last First Kiss," [...] "Back For You," [...] and [...] "They Don't Know About Us." [...] Other tracks, like [...] "Heart Attack," [...] "Rock Me," [...] "I Would," [...] and [...] "Over Again," [...] have a more solemn tone, addressing jealousy and longing for past significant others.|$|E
500|$|However, the Third Test at the Adelaide Oval was {{disastrous}} for Fingleton, who scored a pair as Australia were hammered by 338 runs. He was blamed for leaking {{the details of}} the dressing room exchange between captain Bill Woodfull and English manager Plum Warner, which almost caused the abandonment of the Test series. Warner had visited Woodfull to express sympathies after the Australian captain was struck in the heart by Larwood's short pitched bowling, to which Woodfull retorted [...] "I {{do not want to see}} you Mr. Warner. There are two sides out there. One is playing cricket and the other is not." [...] The leak caused a sensastion, as Woodfull had publicly remained composed in the face of the body barrage, neither complaining nor retaliating. Fingleton was dropped for the remaining two Tests of the series. New South Wales played England after the Third Test and Fingleton had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> his credentials against Bodyline but made only 19 and 7 in a four-wicket defeat, and was unable to force his way back into the Test team. Fingleton always denied responsibility for the leak, blaming Bradman. This incident was the first in a string of open disagreements between Fingleton and Bradman.|$|E
500|$|With digital effects work {{running behind}} schedule, Zemeckis {{convinced}} Wes Takahashi, an animation supervisor from visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic, to help work on The Frighteners. [...] "The shots Zemeckis showed me were pretty remarkable," [...] Takahashi reflected, [...] "but {{there were still}} about 400 shots to do, and everyone was kind of worried." [...] Takahashi was quickly drafted as a visual effects supervisor, and began looking at the schedule, {{trying to work out}} whether The Frighteners could be finished in time. [...] "There was no way we'd make the deadline. I figured out a concerted plan involving Jackson and Zemeckis to convince Universal it was worthy of asking for more money." [...] The executives at Universal proposed splitting some of the shots to visual effects companies in the United States, but Jackson, for whom the film was <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> New Zealand filmmaking could stand alongside Hollywood, convinced Universal otherwise. Instead, The Frighteners received an accelerated release date, four months earlier than planned, and an additional $6 million in financing, with fifteen digital animators and computer workstations (some were borrowed from Universal and other effects companies in the US). Andrew Adamson was hired as a digital effects supervisor.|$|E

500|$|Cousy {{was one of}} six freshmen on the Holy Cross Crusaders' varsity {{basketball}} team in 1946–47. From {{the start of the}} season, coach Doggie Julian chose to play the six freshmen off the bench in a two-team system, so that each player would get some time on the court. As members of the [...] "second team", they would come off the bench nine and a half minutes into the game, where they would relieve the [...] "first team" [...] starters. They would sometimes get to play as much as a third or even half of the game, but even at that Cousy was so disappointed with the lack of playing time that he went to the campus chapel after practice to pray that Julian would give him more of <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> off his talents on the court. Early in the season, however, he got into trouble with Julian, who accused him of being a showboater. Even as late as that 1946–47 season basketball was a static game, depending on slow, deliberate player movement and flat-footed shots. Far different was Cousy's up-tempo, streetball-like game, marked by ambidextrous finesse play and notable for behind-the-back dribbling and no-look, behind-the-back and half-court passing. Even so, he had enough playing time in games to score 227 points for the season, finishing with the third-highest total on the team. Led by stars George Kaftan and Joe Mullaney, the Crusaders finished the 1946–47 basketball season 24–3.|$|E
500|$|Due to time constraints, a team {{of writers}} was {{assigned}} to write the teleplay. In addition to the story credit to Ganino and Stillwell, Moore, Ira Steven Behr, Hans Beimler and Richard Manning would work on the teleplay, and Piller would provide the finishing touches. Because the Writers Guild would not allow more than three staff writers {{to appear in the}} credits (four after a special waiver was granted), Piller agreed to not feature his name in the credits. A partial first draft was submitted on November 30 so that preproduction for the episode could commence. The altered timeline provided <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the Enterprise crew in a much more dramatic and human light than would be allowable in a normal episode. Behr explained that since the original timeline was to be restored, the writers had the freedom to include more action. [...] "Even though it was an alternate universe, [...] and I got all excited because we realized we were going to kill everyone on screen", he said. Michael Okuda and Rick Sternbach submitted technical memos regarding the type of anomaly that might drag the Enterprise-C through time, and suggested interstellar, super-dense strings as a possibility. The first draft teleplay was completed by December 4, and a preproduction meeting was held the same day. Given the scale of the story, various departments argued over costs and what items could be cut to reduce the budget. The final draft was finished and submitted on December 8.|$|E
500|$|NXT Arrival {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Aaron Oster of the Baltimore Sun described the event as fantastic, but [...] "marred by technical issues". He streamed the show live and the stream cut out from Breeze-Woods, which {{caused him to}} miss that match {{and half of the}} main event. Technical issues aside, Oster felt that Arrival [...] "was a phenomenal show that gave the WWE <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> off the NXT roster". He also stated that all three promoted matches met or exceeded his expectations. Cesaro and Zayn's match [...] "wasn't the same as their previous encounters, and they actually built on it" [...] and that [...] "they actually told the story that they knew each other well in the ring, and used it to put on a fantastic 20-minute match". Oster gave high praise to the women's match, he thought it [...] "was better than nearly all of the Divas matches on the main roster for the past few years, featuring some strong chain wrestling and submission moves." [...] He also noted that Emma's sitout powerbomb sparked the crowd to chant [...] "Better than Batista". For the main event, Oster felt that there were [...] "some interesting spots with some good storytelling, even if there weren't the typical brutal spots associated with a ladder match", so it was not [...] "overly special" [...] but still [...] "pretty good". Lastly, Oster praised the announcers, who [...] "worked perfectly together in a traditional sports style, which truly added to the broadcast. WWE should really consider going back to this format for the main shows".|$|E
