40|$|Over {{the past}} years the European Commission has {{undergone}} it most significant changes since its inception. The {{resignation of the}} Santer-Commission in 1999 pushed reform {{to the top of}} the political agenda of the Commission. A range of internal reform measures transformed the functioning and administration of the Commission and its executive responsibilities. Moreover a long series of treaty revision—Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice—since the early 1990 s, changed the legal and political framework governing the <b>appointment</b> <b>and</b> <b>tasks</b> and accountability of the Commission. This all contributed to the transformation of the political and administrative leadership in the European Commission. This paper explores how new rules, recruiting patterns, a change in role interpretations and a transformation in the relationships between political and administrative leaders in the European Commission have emerged. ...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examined}} time management skills and administrative effectiveness of principals in Nigerian secondary schools. The descriptive survey design {{was used for}} the study. The population consisted of all the principals and teachers of secondary schools in Ondo, Ekiti and Osun states. The sample comprised of 200 principals and 600 teachers randomly selected from the three states. The data collected were analysed using frequency counts, simple percentage, mean and standard deviations. The study revealed that the time management skills as well as the level of administrative effectiveness of the principals were encouraging. However, the study revealed the factors that constitute impediments to the time management skills of the principals. These include the need to respond to emergency cases in the school, the need to respond to urgent calls from the ministry of education among others. The study further revealed the strategies that can be put in place for better time management among the principals. These include the need for the principals to identify their most consuming tasks and determine whether or not they have investing their time in the most important activities, and keeping a readily accessible record of their <b>appointment</b> <b>and</b> <b>tasks</b> among others. Based on the findings, it was recommended that the tempo of time management skills of the principals as well as their administrative effectiveness should be sustained while efforts should be directed towards avoiding those factors that constitute impediments to thei...|$|E

40|$|We present {{findings}} from a qualitative study with 28 participants of the dyadic intercultural communication tensions professionals experience in Face-to-Face (FTF) and Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) workplace interactions. We identify four categories of intercultural communication tensions that emerged most frequently in our dataset including range of emotional expression, level of formality, "fixed" versus flexible <b>appointments</b> <b>and</b> <b>task</b> versus social-orientation. We discuss how these tensions manifested in FTF and CMC media and unravel the ways media supports or hinders intercultural communication. We present the adaptations participants made to mitigate such tensions and offer implications for design. Our findings {{demonstrate that the}} most frequently occurring intercultural communication tensions manifested in both FTF and CMC, regardless of the medium used. This indicates that cultural communication challenges will persist no matter the medium, highlighting the opportunity for technologies to better support workplace intercultural communication...|$|R

40|$|The 21 st {{century is}} marked by the {{widespread}} influence of post-modernism and the relativisation of truth. As such, confidence in the truth of Scripture is flagging, and nowhere is this felt more, ironically, than in the <b>appointment</b> <b>and</b> the working of pastors of the Word of God. Movements such as the historical Jesus research abroad, and the so-called “New Reformation” in South Africa, are calling into question long-held tenets of the Christian faith, {{as well as the}} inerrant nature of the Bible. The failing trust in the Scripture has also led to a diminished reliance on exposition of the Bible. This again relates to the training of pastors, as theological training today {{is marked by}} greater disdain for biblical subjects and a threatening rift between practical theology and biblical exposition. The aim {{of this study is to}} demonstrate how the trend might be countered, by applying an exposition of portions of the book of Titus relevant to the selection, appoint, <b>and</b> <b>task</b> of the pastor, to the current situation as it exists today. The exposition focused on the following excerpts from the epistle: 1 : 1 – 2 : 8, 3 : 12 – 15. The pastor was discussed as the exemplification of the Church elder, but it was also noted that all that applies to the pastor, equally applies to all elders of the Church. Emphasis was laid on the character of the pastor, the biblical requirements for the ministry, the appointment of pastors, the biblically mandated task of the pastor, the role of the pastor in defending and teaching sound doctrine, and how the teaching of the pastor is to filter down through the congregation, through the older men to the younger men, the older women to the younger women, and how a general ethos of relational ministry is to pervade the mindset of the whole Church (pastor and congregants) in all that they do. Through the exposition, it is seen that biblical exposition is still relevant, and has a role to play in all spheres of life and theology, including practical theological concerns such as the <b>appointment</b> <b>and</b> <b>task</b> of pastors.

40|$|Since many centuries, {{calendars}} {{are used}} to organize <b>appointments,</b> events <b>and</b> <b>tasks.</b> In this thesis interaction and visualization techniques for calendar data are presented, which do not only support the organization and analysis, but also facilitate and improve them. The basis of the solution is a 3 D heightfield visualization, which displays the workloads of time slots over periods of time in a compact manner. Thereon, interaction and visualization techniques {{are used to}} investigate the data set for regularities and irregularities. The comparison of data sets while planning events {{is just as important}} as the integration of fuzzy tasks into one’s schedule and their manipulation. The visualization and exploration process is completed by statistical representations showing trends and patterns. The use of these techniques and the combination of them are presented with the help of real examples.
