5|$|In {{addition}} to being an author and poet, Cisneros has held various academic and teaching positions. In 1978, after finishing her MFA degree, she taught former high-school dropouts at the Latino Youth High School in Chicago. The 1984 publication of The House on Mango Street secured her a succession of writer-in-residence posts at universities in the United States, teaching creative writing at {{institutions such as the}} University of California, Berkeley and the University of Michigan. She was subsequently a writer-in-residence <b>at</b> <b>Our</b> Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio, Texas. Cisneros has also worked as a college recruiter and an arts administrator.|$|E
5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive <b>at</b> <b>our</b> various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E
