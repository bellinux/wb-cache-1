5|$|Letcher was {{considered}} the strongest Whig candidate in the state, and his inability to win the seat was <b>a</b> <b>harbinger</b> <b>of</b> the ultimate failure of the Whig Party in Kentucky. His loss to Breckinridge {{would be his last}} run for public office, though he remained active in politics until his death. During the 1856 presidential election, Letcher spoke on behalf of Millard Fillmore in Pennsylvania, New York, and Kentucky. In 1857 and 1858, he urged John J. Crittenden to oppose the Lecompton Constitution for Kansas.|$|E

5|$|Prince of Wales and Repulse {{were the}} first capital ships to be sunk solely by naval air power on the open sea (albeit by {{land-based}} rather than carrier-based aircraft), <b>a</b> <b>harbinger</b> <b>of</b> the diminishing role this class of ships was to play in naval warfare thereafter. It is often pointed out, however, that contributing factors to the sinking of Prince of Wales were her surface-scanning radars being inoperable, depriving Force Z {{of one of its}} most potent early-warning devices and the critical early damage she sustained from the first torpedo. Another factor which led to Prince of Waless demise was the loss of dynamos, depriving Prince of Wales of many of her electric pumps. Further electrical failures left parts of the ship in total darkness, and added to the difficulties of her damage repair parties as they attempted to counter the flooding.|$|E

5|$|The 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye did {{transfer}} the Austrian Littoral to Italy, but awarded Dalmatia to Yugoslavia. Following the war, a private force of demobilized Italian soldiers seized Rijeka {{and set up}} the Italian Regency of Carnaro—seen as <b>a</b> <b>harbinger</b> <b>of</b> Fascism—to force the recognition of Italian claims to the city. After sixteen months of the Regency's existence, the 1920 Treaty of Rapallo redefined the Italian–Yugoslav borders, among other things transferring Zadar and the islands of Cres, Lastovo, and Palagruža to Italy, securing the island of Krk for Yugoslavia, and establishing the Free State of Fiume; this new state was abolished in 1924 by the Treaty of Rome that awarded Rijeka to Italy and Sušak to Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|The B's use of {{electrification}} {{instead of}} steam {{power in a}} Baltimore tunnel on the Royal Blue Line, beginning in 1895, marked the first use of electric locomotives by an American railroad and presaged the dawn of practical alternatives to steam power in the 20th century. Spurred by intense competition from the formidable Pennsylvania Railroad, the dominant railroad in the lucrative New YorkWashington market since the 1880s, the Royal Blue in its mid-1930s reincarnation was noted {{for a number of}} technological innovations, including streamlining and the first non-articulated diesel locomotive on a passenger train in the U.S., <b>a</b> <b>harbinger</b> <b>of</b> the steam locomotive's eventual demise.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 2 September 1870 that the new lieutenant-governor Adams George Archibald arrived and set about the {{establishment}} of civil government. Without an amnesty, and with the Canadian militia beating and intimidating his sympathisers, Riel fled {{to the safety of}} the St. Joseph's mission across the Canada–US border in the Dakota Territory. However the results of the first provincial election in December 1870 were promising for Riel, as many of his supporters came to power. Nevertheless, stress and financial troubles precipitated a serious illness—perhaps <b>a</b> <b>harbinger</b> <b>of</b> his future mental afflictions—that prevented his return to Manitoba until May 1871. The settlement now faced a possible threat, from cross-border Fenian raids coordinated by his former associate William Bernard O'Donoghue. Archibald proclaimed a general call to arms on 4 October. Companies of armed horsemen were raised, including one led by Riel. When Archibald reviewed the troops in St. Boniface, he made the significant gesture of publicly shaking Riel's hand, signaling that a rapprochement had been affected. This was not to be—when this news reached Ontario, Mair and members of the Canada First movement whipped up anti-Riel (and anti-Archibald) sentiment. With Federal elections coming in 1872, Macdonald could ill afford further rift in Quebec-Ontario relations and so he did not offer an amnesty. Instead he quietly arranged for Taché to offer Riel a bribe of $1,000 to remain in voluntary exile. This was supplemented by an additional £600 from Smith for the care of Riel's family.|$|E
