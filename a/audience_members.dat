5|$|Whitmire and Goelz {{appear as}} <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> at Aunt Em's Diner during the finale.|$|E
5|$|DAAS {{are known}} for their aggressive, provocative style; their habit of {{involving}} <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> and their tendency to attack topical and sometimes controversial issues in their comedy.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the filming}} {{was done by}} the actors using {{hand-held}} cameras, much of the footage is shaky, especially the final sequence in which a character is running down a set of stairs with the camera. Some <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> experienced motion sickness and even vomited as a result.|$|E
50|$|If {{the check}} writer {{was able to}} {{complete}} three digits in their check, the check writer played a game against a studio <b>audience</b> <b>member.</b> The <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> was shown four prizes and their values, and asked to pick one. The check writer had to guess the prize the <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> selected. If incorrect, the <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> won that prize, and the process repeated with the remaining prizes. If the check writer incorrectly guessed three times, the check writer lost their position and the <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> won all four prizes.|$|R
50|$|Three contestants, {{chosen from}} the studio {{audience}}, competed in games of chance, all related to gambling. Three audience members's names were each hidden behind one of nine slot machine symbols on a gameboard. An <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> was selected and chose four symbols from the board. For each symbol that hid a contestant's name, the <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> received $25. If the <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> uncovered all three contestants's names, then the <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> won a bonus prize.|$|R
5000|$|The {{audience}} is canvassed {{on a certain}} issue (for example, should Earthlings welcome aliens from other planets?) and an <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> who declares himself or herself undecided is selected. The <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> must listen to the panelists' arguments on the issue (one pair arguing [...] "for" [...] and the other arguing [...] "against"). The <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> must then make up his or her mind; two points are awarded to the team that argued for the <b>audience</b> <b>member's</b> decision.|$|R
5|$|Clips of {{the episode}} were shown to <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> at Star Wars Celebration IV, where a panel was hosted by MacFarlane, Sulkin and Polcino, and {{executive}} producer David A. Goodman. The episode was also previewed at the 2007 Comic-Con International.|$|E
5|$|The concerto delle donne {{transformed}} the musica secreta. In the past, {{members of the}} audience would perform, and performers would become <b>audience</b> <b>members.</b> During the ascendancy of the concerto delle donne the roles within the musica secreta became fixed, as did the roster of those who performed for the Duke's pleasure every night.|$|E
5|$|The first {{programme}} had guests such as Eamon Dunphy, Fintan O'Toole, Pat Farrell, Tom Parlon and Brian Lenihan, Minister for Finance. <b>Audience</b> <b>members</b> included {{small business}} people and mortgage holders. Lenihan {{talked about the}} proposed National Asset Management Agency and the purchase of €28 billion in loans from Anglo Irish Bank.|$|E
50|$|Both U&G and MSD theorists {{view the}} <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> as active, {{but the basic}} conceptions of the <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> differ. U&G theorists focus on {{psychological}} and sociodemographic origins of differences in media use. In this perspective, the variability of text interpretation suggests an <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> {{in charge of the}} text.|$|R
50|$|If a sales person {{wants to}} show a {{customer}} a slide illustrating features of his product, he may want {{to determine whether or}} not the <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> is interested in the product. This is done by placing an interactor on the slide before being delivered to the <b>audience</b> <b>member.</b> Upon delivery, the <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> 'interacts' with the interActor, with the result of this interaction written to a database back on the host system. This way, the presenter has a permanent record of the <b>audience</b> <b>member's</b> preferences.|$|R
50|$|If the {{contestant}} successfully {{completes the}} stunt before {{anyone in the}} studio audience gets a bingo, the contestant wins one of various prizes. If not, then an <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> wins $5,000 (or a prize the studio contestant failed to win {{on at least one}} occasion). In the event that the in-studio contestant completes their game and an <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> gets a bingo, only the <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> wins.|$|R
5|$|A female human {{trafficking}} victim is interviewed {{with her face}} hidden. She describes how she and other {{human trafficking}} victims in Eastern Europe were held in buildings with security cameras, where {{they were forced to}} walk naked down a runway before a group of men who watched under the guise of attending a fashion show. She then describes being auctioned off to the <b>audience</b> <b>members,</b> who she says examined her off the runway as one might examine cattle.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{trick was}} to swallow 30 to 50 unshelled {{hazelnuts}} (although {{one of his}} posters advertised 40 pecans), followed by another nut of a different variety, such as an almond. Ali then brought them up one by one with the odd-nut-out produced at a mark called out by the audience. In another trick, Ali swallowed three to six handkerchiefs of different hues and then produced them in a color order requested by <b>audience</b> <b>members.</b>|$|E
5|$|Audience {{etiquette}} {{is generally}} similar to formal western theatre—the audience quietly watches. Surtitles are not used, but some <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> follow {{along in the}} libretto. Because there are no curtains on the stage, the performance begins with the actors entering the stage and ends with their leaving the stage. The house lights are usually kept on during the performances, creating an intimate feel that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience.|$|E
50|$|On occasion, Norton {{would even}} {{go so far}} as to {{secretly}} produce a pre-selected <b>audience</b> <b>member’s</b> parents or lover to witness or take part in an embarrassing event without the <b>audience</b> <b>member’s</b> knowledge.|$|R
50|$|Moving People/Moving Bodies - Two {{or three}} {{performers}} start a scene with an <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> selected to move each performer. The performers can talk but cannot move at all unless moved by their <b>audience</b> <b>member.</b>|$|R
50|$|In each game, {{the solo}} {{contestant}} competes in a minigame that also serves to unveil the numbers being {{called for the}} game. He or she then tries to complete the minigame and outlast the audience before they could declare bingo. If they are successful, they win ₱1,000,000; if an <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> beats them to it, they walk away with nothing and the <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> wins ₱50,000. In case of a tie, the <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> still wins.|$|R
5|$|Filming started {{shortly before}} 7.00pm, and ended at around 8.30pm; Griffin left the {{building}} 10 minutes later. <b>Audience</b> <b>members</b> inside the studios used their mobile phones to relay live information about the recording's progress. James Lyons, political correspondent for the Daily Mirror, wrote that {{the mood in the}} studio turned from anger to mockery of Griffin.|$|E
5|$|FreeFall Stage {{discouraged}} {{people under the}} age of fifteen from attending because of {{the subject matter of the}} play, but encouraged older teenagers to attend because teenagers are at the greatest risk of being trafficked. Several human trafficking survivors attended the performances, and other survivors sent the Eldridges messages about their personal experiences with human trafficking. Quandt said that he encountered many <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> who, because of watching the play, became determined to do something to combat human trafficking.|$|E
5|$|Shearer often speaks {{and writes}} about {{the failure of the}} Federal levee system which flooded New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, belittling the {{coverage}} of it in the mainstream media and criticizing the role of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Prior to the DVD release of his film, The Big Uneasy, Shearer would hold screenings of the film at different venues and take questions from <b>audience</b> <b>members.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} the {{illusion}} is a disappearance of the magician and an <b>audience</b> <b>member,</b> and their reappearance in the pre-selected location via video feed. A picture of the magician with the <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> is taken, and then showed by the two man on video after the disappearance. After the reunion of the <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> with a loved relative Copperfield appears back in the audience {{on the other side}} of the stage, then it starts raining in the theater.|$|R
50|$|An <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> would {{introduce}} the game.|$|R

5|$|The concert {{took place}} on Saturday, September 19, 1981, on the Great Lawn, the central open space of Central Park. The first spectators, many {{carrying}} chairs or picnic blankets, arrived at daybreak to secure a good spot. The Parks Department originally expected about 300,000 attendees. Although rain fell throughout the day and continued until {{the start of the}} concert, an estimated 500,000 <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> made this the seventh-largest concert attendance in the United States in history.|$|E
5|$|After the show, WWE {{was criticized}} for a {{malfunction}} in the pyrotechnics during The Undertaker's victory celebration. During the celebration, a hot cable for pyrotechnics was sent flying into <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> in the upper seating bowl of the stadium, leaving 45 injured, with some hospitalized. The accident was apparently due to a cable which fireworks were traveling across snapping, thus resulting in the fireworks exploding into the top rows of the upper bowl of the stadium. WWE's corporate website released a statement afterward stating that they would investigate the incident, but {{the results of the}} investigation were never released.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{animation}} required for Deadpool's mask and Colossus, Reese and Wernick had more freedom than usual to keep adjusting the script during post-production. Reynolds recorded new lines of dialogue using his iPhone, and then re-recorded {{the lines in}} an additional dialogue recording session once the film was finalized. Lines added after filming included Reynolds doing an impression of Wolverine star Hugh Jackman's natural Australian accent, and another where Deadpool asks whether the character Professor X is being portrayed by James McAvoy or Patrick Stewart {{at that point in}} the X-Men timeline, which became a favorite line in the film for many <b>audience</b> <b>members.</b>|$|E
50|$|Song for a Lady (a.k.a. Duet, Song to an <b>Audience</b> <b>Member)</b> - One {{to three}} {{performers}} {{sing a song}} to an <b>audience</b> <b>member,</b> incorporating details of her life provided through a pre-song interview. This version {{of the game is}} significantly longer and more detailed than the Whose Line version.|$|R
50|$|An <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> {{introducing}} the game would be pied.|$|R
50|$|The show {{also had}} a round {{featuring}} a large floor-based game wheel with eight mini-games. An <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> was selected to lie on the wheel and act as the indicator, and the wheel with the <b>audience</b> <b>member</b> was spun once by each contestant who would play the game that resulted.|$|R
5|$|Defendants Irving Potash and Benjamin J. Davis {{were among}} the <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> {{attacked}} as they left a September 4 concert headlined by Paul Robeson in Peekskill, New York. It was given to benefit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC), which was funding the defendants' legal expenses. Hundreds lined the roads leaving the performance grounds and threw rocks and bottles at the departing vehicles without interference by the police. Over 140 people suffered injuries, including Potash, whose eyes were struck by glass from a broken windshield. The trial was suspended for two days while Potash recovered from his injuries.|$|E
5|$|Precious {{received}} {{dozens of}} nominations in award categories, including six Academy Award nominations, {{not only for}} the film itself but for the cast's performances, the direction and cinematography, and the adaptation of the novel to the screenplay. Director Lee Daniels won the People's Choice Award, an award given by <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Daniels won both awards for which he was nominated at the San Sebastián International Film Festival—the TVE Otra Mirada Award and the Audience Award. He was also nominated in the category of Bronze Horse at the Stockholm Film Festival, and won the Best Feature Film Award at the Hawaii International Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|Robert Englund, who portrayed Krueger in the {{previous}} eight films, voiced his support of the remake and the casting of Haley in the role. A Nightmare on Elm Street was officially released in North America on April 30, 2010, and later released in foreign markets on May 8, 2010. The film was met with primarily negative reviews from film critics, as well as <b>audience</b> <b>members</b> who scored the film a C+. Regardless, A Nightmare on Elm Street broke the record for midnight openings for a horror film. The film has brought in over $63 million at the domestic box office, and over $115 million worldwide.|$|E
