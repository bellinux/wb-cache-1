Considerable progress has been made in screening and breeding for resistance to shoot fly, stem borers, greenbug, midge, <b>armyworms</b> and head bugs. Resistance to major pests is available in diverse genotypes. It is possible to combine resistance to two or more insect species in some cases (e. g. shoot fly and stem borer, stem borer and <b>armyworms,</b> midge and aphids and head bugs and head caterpillars). However, it may be quite difficult to combine resistance to some insect species (e. g. shoot fly versus midge and/or head bugs). Host-plant resistance can be used for the management of sorghum midge, greenbug, mites, aphids and head caterpillars. However, host-plant resistance need to be supplemented with other methods of pest control for shoot fly, stem borers. <b>armyworms</b> and head bugs...|$|R
50|$|STAR {{radio in}} Liberia {{reported}} in January 2009 that Zota District in Bong County had been invaded by African <b>armyworms,</b> which had consumed vegetation, polluted creeks and running water, and were moving toward Guinea and Sierra Leone. On 28 January 2009, the President of Liberia {{declared a state}} of emergency to deal with the infestation of army worms in the country.December 2009 had an infestation of ten regions of Tanzania. The infested regions include three of the five main grain-producing regions. The other two major grain-producing regions are at risk of infestation. Tanzania has trained farmers in fighting <b>armyworms</b> since 2007, and responded to forecasts of the late 2009 infestation by sending out hundreds of liters of pesticides to rural farmers. The first infestation was reported on 22 December and quickly spread to surrounding regions. The previous growing season had Tanzania produce 10.872 million tons of grain; after 10.337 million tons of domestic consumption, the remaining 0.534 million tons were exported. By 31 December almost 1400 acre of grain had been destroyed by <b>armyworms.</b>|$|R

40|$|In a Rapid Rural Appraisal Survey, {{conducted}} in American Samoa in November, 1990, farmers reported that planting Coleus blumei (pate in Samoan) with taro (Colocasia esculenta) kept <b>armyworms</b> (Spodoptera litura) and/or planthoppers (Tarophagus proserpina) from their taro fields. Two experiments were {{conducted at the}} Land Grant Station in American Samoa from May to November, 1991 and February to August 1992, respectively, to test this hypothesis. In the first study, semi-monthly insect counts were made on two fields, one planted with Coleus blumei {{in the center and}} one without the Coleus. Insect data were collected from each of eight quadrates surrounding the Coleus and at three distances away {{from the center of the}} field. There were no significant differences in pest incidence between Coleus and non-Coleus fields. Results indicated a slight trend toward fewer <b>armyworms</b> and planthoppers in the field planted with Coleus. A second study compared insect incidence in eight taro plots, four with and four without a border of Coleus. Insect counts were collected semi-monthly. No statistical differences were found between insect incidence in the two types of plots. There was a trend toward more <b>armyworms</b> in the non-Coleus plot. Future studies will focus on examining other environmental factors that might influence taro pest and/or parasite incidence, as well as modifications in experimental design...|$|R
