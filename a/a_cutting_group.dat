5000|$|The L.A.TEST Stage was a 99 seat, Los Angeles Equity-waiver house, {{founded by}} {{director}} Benjamin Stuart Thompson and producer Ella Belzberg, {{with the intention}} of showcasing the work of <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> edge <b>group</b> of actors, writers, directors, producers and theatre technicians. Initially, lectures and workshops were held in Theda Bara's home. In 1983, The L.A.TEST Stage started in a converted 5-car garage dubbed the [...] "Cockroach Club" [...] with 60 plush seats donated by UCLA’s Royce Hall. The first production was Sam Shepard’s Angel City starring Ron Cambell. [...] "Angel City" [...] played to full houses until the Los Angeles Fire Marshal ordered the theatre capacity not to exceed seven persons. Since the cast had five, the final performance was for an audience of two: the legendary producer, Ted Schmitt of the CAST Theatres in Hollywood and his assistant. After the performance, Schmitt handed over the keys to the C.A.S.T/Safe Harbor on La Cienega Blvd., which was converted into the L.A.TEST Stage. [...] "The Latest Stage's trademark is productions full of frolicking energy, like their adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac, which took place in an exciting pirate setting." ...|$|R

40|$|From an {{analytical}} viewpoint, {{the relationship between}} rough mill cutting bill part requirements and lumber yield is highly complex. Part requirements can have almost any length, width, and quantity distribution within the boundaries set by physical limitations, such as maximum length and width of parts. This complexity {{makes it difficult to}} understand the specific relationship between cutting bill requirements and lumber yield, rendering the optimization of the lumber cntting process through improved cutting bill composition difficult. An approach is presented to decrease the complexity of cutting bills to allow for easier analysis and, ultimately, to optimize cutting bill compositions. Principles from clustering theory were employed to create a standadized way to describe cutting bills. Cutting bill part clusters are part <b>groups</b> within the <b>cutting</b> bill's total part size space, where all parts are reset to a given group's midpoint. Statistical testing was used to determine a minimum resolution part group matrix that had no significant influence on yield compared to <b>an</b> actual <b>cutting</b> bill. Iterative search led to <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> bill part <b>group</b> matrix that encompasses five groups in length and four groups in width, forming a 20 -part group matrix. The lengths of the individual p a t groups created var...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> tool for producing a test cut in workpieces in panel or strip form, in particular on sheet, whereby the tool has a first cut {{and a second}} cut which is movable past the first cut to form <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> gap. The purpose of invention is to create <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> tool which permits the generation of a test cut using <b>a</b> single <b>cutting</b> operation, permitting <b>an</b> assessment of several parameters of the cuttability of the workpiece such as the achievable cut edge quality, the occurrence of cutting burr and the optimum cutting gap width to be selected.

40|$|Vibrations of a tool or <b>a</b> {{workpiece}} in <b>cutting</b> shorten {{tool life}} and deteriorate a surface roughness. In this research, we propose {{a method to}} reduce vibrations of the workpiece at <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> point. An algorithm that generates <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> path to minimize workpiece displacements at <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> point is developed. In this algorithm, the cutting path is generated with changing feed directions, tool posture and material removal process by considering workpiece compliance matrices and cutting force vectors. Feed directions and tool posture are changed to control {{the direction of the}} cutting force vector. Material removal process is changed to control the change of the workpiece compliance. FEM (Finite Element Method) is used to calculate workpiece compliance matrices. SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) is used to calculate the direction which has the lowest compliance in the workpiece compliance matrices. Minimum workpiece displacement at <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> point is calculated from these calculated results. The algorithm is applied to the cutting path of end milling for a simple bar and the cutting path is compared with two conventional cutting paths by conducting a simulation and <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> test. <b>As</b> a result, mean values of workpiece displacement were reduced by applying the algorithm...|$|R

25|$|Thread forming is {{performed}} using a , or , which closely resembles <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> tap without the flutes. There are lobes periodically spaced around the tap that actually do the thread forming as the tap is advanced into a properly sized hole. Since the tap does not produce chips, {{there is no need}} to periodically back out the tap to clear away chips, which, in <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> tap, can jam and break the tap. Thus thread forming is particularly suited to tapping blind holes, which are tougher to tap with <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> tap due to the chip build-up in the hole. Note that the tap drill size differs from that used for <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> tap and that an accurate hole size is required because a slightly undersized hole can break the tap. Proper lubrication is essential because of the frictional forces involved, therefore a lubricating oil is used instead of cutting oil.|$|R
