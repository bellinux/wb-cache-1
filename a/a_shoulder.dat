5|$|A common {{plot device}} is referenced, where <b>a</b> <b>shoulder</b> angel (represents conscience) and <b>a</b> <b>shoulder</b> devil (representing temptation) appear near a {{character}}. This concept is spoofed in the episode, {{as both the}} devil and the angel suggest to Mackey that he should drink the beer. When Stan tells Kyle what he thinks a bris means, a dolly zoom is used, which is an unsettling filmmaking effect often used {{to show that a}} character is undergoing a major realization. The hallucinogenic effects of certain drugs are portrayed by different means. When inhaling cannabis, the alley that Mr. Mackey is in suddenly turns very colorful. After taking LSD, Mackey's head inflates like a giant balloon, and then literally detaches from his body, and floats away (the boys interact with Mackey by looking up at his head as it floats over them).|$|E

5|$|As NHL {{play was}} set to resume the {{following}} season, Salo signed another two-year contract with the Canucks at $1.5 million per season. He was limited to 59 games in the subsequent 2005–06 season, suffering <b>a</b> <b>shoulder</b> injury with the Finnish national team during the 2006 Winter Olympics, colliding with a teammate during a line change. He recorded 10 goals and 33 points with the Canucks, second among team defencemen in scoring. His 23 assists were also a career-high.|$|E
5|$|Calgary {{ended the}} {{exhibition}} season with several injuries to key players. Centre Daymond Langkow remained sidelined following a neck injury suffered the previous season, while Ryan Stone (knee) was also out. Matt Stajan suffered <b>a</b> <b>shoulder</b> separation, David Moss also suffered <b>a</b> <b>shoulder</b> injury and Ales Kotalik {{was lost to}} a knee injury. As {{a result of the}} injuries, the Flames signed centre Brendan Morrison to a contract; Morrison had been in training camp with the Canucks before being released. Rookie defenceman T. J. Brodie proved the surprise player of training camp. Expected to start the year with the Abbotsford Heat of the American Hockey League (AHL), Brodie impressed the Flames' coaching staff and earned a position on the team to begin the NHL season.|$|E
5|$|Coming off {{a loss to}} Minnesota the {{preceding}} week, Penn State looked to defeat Purdue, which they had in every meeting since 2004. Though expected to beat an overmatched Purdue squad that was reeling, having lost 38–14 the prior week against Iowa, and 56–0 the week before that against Ohio State, and entering {{the game with a}} 1–8 record, the Lions would have to do so with even less depth than normal. At his mid-week press conference, Bill O'Brien announced at the midweek press conference that Ben Kline would miss the remainder of the season with <b>a</b> <b>shoulder</b> injury, for which he sustained surgery. There was also some pregame concentration surrounding the receiving corps – Allen Robinson was listed on the injury report with <b>a</b> <b>shoulder</b> injury, and Geno Lewis, who had proved to be a potential big play threat early in the season when he caught a 54-yard touchdown pass against Syracuse, but had recently been relegated to special teams, was also expected to receive increased playing time in Penn State's second-to-last home game of the season.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> {{separated}} <b>shoulder</b> (also {{known as}} acromioclavicular separation, AC separation), {{is a common}} injury to the acromioclavicular joint. It is a joint dislocation, {{but it is not}} called <b>a</b> dislocated <b>shoulder,</b> as that term refers to <b>a</b> glenohumeral joint (<b>shoulder</b> joint) dislocation. The AC joint is located at the distal end of the clavicle, known as the acromial end, and attaches to the acromion of the scapula. Although {{this is part of the}} <b>shoulder,</b> <b>a</b> dislocated <b>shoulder</b> and <b>a</b> separated <b>shoulder</b> are completely different. Acromioclavicular separation occurs as a result of a downward force being applied to the superior part of the acromion, either by something striking the top of the acromion or by falling directly on it. The injury is more likely to occur if the shoulder is struck with the hand outstretched. Despite the scapula pulling on the clavicle during impact, the clavicle remains in its general fixed position because of the sternoclavicular joint ligaments.|$|R
