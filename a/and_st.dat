40|$|AbstractThe yeast glucose sensors Rgt 2 and Snf 3 {{generate}} a signal {{in response to}} glucose that leads to degradation of Mth 1 <b>and</b> <b>Std</b> 1, thereby relieving repression of Rgt 1 -repressed genes such as the glucose transporter genes (HXT). Mth 1 <b>and</b> <b>Std</b> 1 are degraded via the Yck 1 / 2 kinase-SCFGrr 1 - 26 S proteasome pathway triggered by the glucose sensors. Here, we show that RGT 2 - 1 promotes ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Mth 1 <b>and</b> <b>Std</b> 1 regardless {{of the presence of}} glucose. Site-specific mutagenesis reveals that the conserved lysine residues of Mth 1 <b>and</b> <b>Std</b> 1 might serve as attachment sites for ubiquitin, and that the potential casein kinase (Yck 1 / 2) sites of serine phosphorylation might control their ubiquitination. Finally, we show that active Snf 1 protein kinase in high glucose prevents degradation of Mth 1 <b>and</b> <b>Std</b> 1...|$|R
