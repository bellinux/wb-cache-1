5|$|Silkies lay a {{fair number}} of eggs, of <b>a</b> <b>cream</b> color, but {{production}} is often interrupted due to their extreme tendency to go broody; a hen will produce 100 eggs in an ideal year.

This docility can cause Silkies to be bullied by more active or aggressive birds when kept in mixed flocks.|$|E
