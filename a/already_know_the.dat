5|$|In mid-July 1845, Marx and Engels left Brussels for England {{to visit}} {{the leaders of the}} Chartists, a socialist {{movement}} in Britain. This was Marx's first trip to England and Engels was an ideal guide for the trip. Engels had already spent two years living in Manchester from November 1842 to August 1844. Not only did Engels <b>already</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> English language, he had also developed a close relationship with many Chartist leaders. Indeed, Engels was serving as a reporter for many Chartist and socialist English newspapers. Marx used the trip as an opportunity to examine the economic resources available for study in various libraries in London and Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Youth {{spend too}} much time {{learning}} what their teachers think is important, irrelevant from what the youth may <b>already</b> <b>know.</b> <b>The</b> manager of learning value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner to a situation to help both the learner and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This is followed by a period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what he has learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.|$|E
25|$|A {{refinement}} of this method, known as importance sampling in statistics, involves sampling the points randomly, but more frequently where the integrand is large. To do this precisely {{one would have}} to <b>already</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> integral, but one can approximate the integral by an integral of a similar function or use adaptive routines such as stratified sampling, recursive stratified sampling, adaptive umbrella sampling or the VEGAS algorithm.|$|E

25|$|Bottom-up approach: Once we {{formulate}} {{the solution}} to a problem recursively as in terms of its sub-problems, we can try reformulating the problem in a bottom-up fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions to bigger and bigger sub-problems by using the solutions to small sub-problems. For example, if we <b>already</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> values of F41 and F40, we can directly calculate the value of F42.|$|E
500|$|The book then {{shifts to}} events {{occurring}} soon after Halo, as the Master Chief and Cortana drift through {{the ruins of}} Halo, they discover other survivors including Sergeant Johnson and Corporal Locklear. The group commandeer the Covenant flagship Ascendant Justice and use its slipspace capabilities {{to return to the}} Reach system. To prevent the Covenant finding Earth with a tracking device, the humans plan to find a suitably undamaged human ship to take them to Earth. Upon arrival the group receive a radio signal used by the Spartans in their training days. On the surface, they find three Spartans and Vice Admiral Danforth Whitcomb, the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. The Vice Admiral arms a [...] "Nova thermonuclear mine", a weapon that would destroy the planet. The Master Chief and his newly acquired team of Spartans then proceed to rescue Dr. Halsey and the other Spartans that were trapped under the surface of the planet. Meanwhile, Cortana, still aboard Ascendant Justice, learns that the Covenant <b>already</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> location of Earth and are preparing an invasion fleet.|$|E
500|$|... "Business School" [...] was {{the second}} Office episode written by Brent Forrester. [...] Forrester had {{previously}} written [...] "The Merger". [...] The episode {{was the first to}} be directed by Joss Whedon. [...] Whedon, who is a friend of both producer Greg Daniels and Jenna Fischer, and also met most of the production staff prior to the episode, stated that he chose to direct the episode [...] "because I <b>already</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> writing staff and a bunch of the cast, and I adore the show." [...] When informed that the episode was about a bat entering into the office and one of the characters pretending to be a vampire, Whedon thought that it was a joke, stating [...] "Didn't I just leave this party?" [...] in reference to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. [...] In an interview featured on the third season DVD, Whedon joked that the [...] "Business School" [...] episode and his former TV show were very similar because [...] "Buffy [...] was sad and depressing but... it was funny. Especially when people died. And {{a lot of people do}} die in [...]" [...] But upon completing the episode, Whedon stated [...] "That was just coincidence. But that's how that happened. God, it was fun." [...] Whedon stated that he was surprised with the amount of input he was allowed with the script. [...] "I wouldn't say freedom to do things with it...But way more input was asked for than I would have ever anticipated." [...] At Pam's art show, the pieces which she was supposed to have painted didn't suit Whedon. [...] "I got to the set and saw Pam's art, and I was like, 'This is not right.'" [...] Whedon said that he held up filming for over an hour until the staff was able create new pieces of art.|$|E

2500|$|On May 21, 2015, Madonna rescheduled {{the first}} five dates of the tour and moved them to January 20, 23, 24, 27 and 28 in 2016. The singer {{confirmed}} that arrangement logistics {{was the cause of}} the postponement. She released a statement saying, [...] "As my fans <b>already</b> <b>know,</b> <b>the</b> show has to be perfect. Assembling all the elements will require more time than we realized. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause my fans." [...] According to Billboard, Rebel Heart is an all-arena tour, and would visit cities where Madonna has not performed before. The tour visited Australia and New Zealand in early 2016, and was the singer's first visit to Australia in more than 20 years, having last toured there with The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993, and her first time in New Zealand. Philippines was added to the tour itinerary, for two performances at SM Mall of Asia in February 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{pictorial}} {{nature of the}} oracle bone script, it was a fully functional and mature writing system {{by the time of}} the Shang dynasty, i.e., able to record the Old Chinese language in its entirety and not just isolated kinds of meaning. This level of maturity clearly implies an earlier period of development of at least several hundred years. From their presumed origins as pictographs and signs, by the Shang dynasty, most graphs were already conventionalized in such a simplified fashion that the meanings of many of the pictographs are not immediately apparent. Compare, for instance, the third and fourth graphs in the row below. Without careful research to compare these to later forms, one would probably not know that these represented 豕 shĭ [...] "swine" [...] and 犬 quǎn [...] "dog", respectively. As Boltz (1994 & 2003 p.31–33) notes, most of the oracle bone graphs are not depicted realistically enough for those who do not <b>already</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> script to recognize what they stand for; although pictographic in origin they are no longer pictographs in function. Boltz instead calls them zodiographs (p.33), reminding us that functionally they represent words, and only through the words do they represent concepts, while for similar reasons Qiu labels them semantographs.|$|E

And now, sir, as I may not ask you to stay in this house where I live alone, and there is no inn near, I propose to send serving men to conduct you to my brother's dwelling that is something more than a mile away, if indeed,' she added slowly, 'you do not <b>already</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> path!

6000|$|A {{question}} arises here: Whether, in some ulterior, perhaps some not far-distant stage of this 'Chivalry of Labour,' your Master-Worker may {{not find it}} possible, and needful, to grant his Workers permanent interest in his enterprise and theirs? So that it become, in practical result, what in essential fact and justice it ever is, a joint enterprise; all men, from the Chief Master down to the lowest Overseer and Operative, economically as well as loyally concerned for it?--Which question I do not answer. The answer, near or else far, is perhaps, Yes;--and yet one knows the difficulties. Despotism is essential in most enterprises; I am told, they do not tolerate 'freedom of debate' on board a Seventy-four! Republican senate and plebiscita would not answer well in Cotton-Mills. And yet observe there too: Freedom, not nomad's or ape's Freedom, but man's Freedom; this is indispensable. We must have it, and will have it! To reconcile Despotism with Freedom:--well, is that such a mystery? Do you not <b>already</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> way? It is to make your Despotism just. Rigorous as Destiny; but just too, as Destiny and its Laws. The Laws of God: all men obey these, and have no 'Freedom' at all but in obeying them. The way is already known, part of the way;--and courage and some qualities are needed for walking on it! ...|$|E
