5|$|Upon making {{landfall}} {{on south}} Samar on December10, Hibok-Hibok erupted {{six times in}} rapid succession, worsening the effects of both the typhoon and the volcano. <b>Amy</b> <b>had</b> also made landfall on an area impacted by a second typhoon three weeks prior. Strong winds displaced and destroyed residences and uprooted trees, while torrential rainfall caused rivers to overflow, resulting in the flooding of sugarcane fields and the washing away of bridges. Radio communications to and between most of the central Philippine islands were disrupted.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Typhoon Amy {{can be traced}} back to a {{low-pressure}} area first detected over Kwajalein at 0500UTC on November29. Tracking westward, the Fleet Weather Center in Guam began to monitor vorticity for potential development, assigning the numeric designation 11122 to the tropical system. Late on December2, a routine weather reconnaissance flight unexpectedly intercepted the disturbance and detected unusually strong westerly winds, a characteristic typically indicative of a tropical cyclone. As such, the flight, named Vulture George, was rerouted to investigate the area. After finding conclusive evidence of a closed low-pressure area, the Fleet Weather Center in Guam classified the disturbance as a tropical storm with winds of 100km/h (60mph). At the time, <b>Amy</b> <b>had</b> two separate centers of circulation, resulting in an asymmetrical wind field.|$|E

25|$|Morris' {{wife and}} {{business}} partner <b>Amy</b> <b>had</b> vouched {{for her husband}} and claims to have helped frame the suit.

500|$|On 15 August 2011, the BBC {{released}} a short [...] "prequel" [...] to [...] "Let's Kill Hitler", written by Steven Moffat. In the prequel, Amy calls the Doctor and leaves {{a message for}} the Doctor on the TARDIS's answer phone, begging him to find her child, Melody. Though Amy knows Melody will {{grow up to be}} River Song, she does not want to miss seeing her grow up. As she ends her message, it is revealed that a very upset Doctor was listening but did not pick up the phone, even though <b>Amy</b> <b>had</b> pleaded for him to.|$|E
500|$|In modern-day Leadworth, Amy and Rory {{create a}} crop circle {{to gain the}} Doctor's {{attention}} via its newspaper coverage. He arrives with his TARDIS, but they are soon joined by Mels, Amy and Rory's childhood friend who knows of Amy's [...] "raggedy Doctor" [...] and was responsible for Amy and Rory's relationship; <b>Amy</b> <b>had</b> subsequently named her daughter Melody after Mels. On the run from the police after stealing a car, Mels brandishes a gun and coerces them to escape in the TARDIS and [...] "kill Hitler". Inside, she fires the gun, hitting the central consoles time rotar, which fills the time machine with a poisonous gas and sends it out of control.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} drafts of the script, there were [...] "so many copies of people {{running around the}} place" [...] which made the story too confusing, so Graham and the {{production}} crew worked {{to make it more}} rational. The episode also contains a subplot in which Rory helps and protects Jennifer as she is scared and affected by the Gangers, which proved a twist in Amy and Rory's relationship. Karen Gillan enjoyed the twist. <b>Amy</b> <b>had</b> previously always had Rory [...] "in the palm of her hand" [...] and a different side of the character was shown as she experienced the same emotions Rory felt when she seemed interested in the Doctor. Arthur Darvill also thought it gave Rory a chance to [...] "man up" [...] and be a hero by protecting someone.|$|E

500|$|Gillan had {{substantial}} {{input into}} Amy's costume, {{as well as}} her hair and make-up. In the first episode, Holman stated that Amy's identity was not clear and she wore her own clothes later on. Gillan thought that <b>Amy</b> <b>had</b> inner confidence to wear clothes that showed [...] "a bit of skin from time to time". She tried on many things, {{but when it came to}} short skirts she [...] "just thought it was right" [...] and showed that Amy was [...] "comfortable and confident about her look". She believed that the skirts reflected what young women typically wear at her age. Executive producer Piers Wenger also noted that Amy's 1970s flying jacket, which she wears [...] "quite a lot", reflected Gillan was a [...] "born adventurer" [...] and Amy developed a love for travel and adventure.|$|E
500|$|Amy Winehouse {{was born}} in Chase Farm Hospital, in north London, to Jewish parents. Her father, Mitchell [...] "Mitch" [...] Winehouse, was a window panel {{installer}} and then a taxi driver; and her mother, Janis Winehouse (née Seaton), was a pharmacist. Winehouse's ancestors were Russian and Polish Jewish immigrants to London. <b>Amy</b> <b>had</b> an older brother, Alex (born 1979), and the family lived in London's Southgate area, where she attended Osidge Primary School. Winehouse as a child attended a Jewish Sunday school. After she rose to fame, during an interview she expressed her dismissal towards the school by saying {{that she used to}} beg her father to allow her not to go and that she learnt nothing about being Jewish by going anyway. In the same interview, Winehouse said she only went to a synagogue once a year on Yom Kippur [...] "out of respect".|$|E

Ketchum is devastated at {{having failed to}} protect his friends and takes his own life at Twisted River. Danny, who has now lost his mother, father, son and their friend, tries to focus on writing his next book, a follow-up to his previous eight semi-autobiographical novels. Then his last hope, Amy ("Lady Sky"), arrives on his doorstep. When Joe was 2, <b>Amy</b> <b>had</b> parachuted naked onto a pig farm Danny and Joe were visiting. Danny rescued Amy from the pig pen and Joe, awe-struck by this event, called her [...] "Lady Sky". Amy in turn offered to help Danny whenever he needed it. Having read all about the famous writer and his misfortunes, Amy tracks Danny down and moves in with him.

500|$|As the storyline developed, it {{held the}} {{potential}} to ruin the positive changes that the character had achieved. Halfpenny said <b>Amy</b> <b>had</b> become really close to Val and Eric. They are in a [...] "good place" [...] and they think [...] "Amy's all happy." [...] The one person she wants to tell is Val, with whom she shares the closest bond and shes [...] "gutted" [...] to remain silent. It prevents them from having a normal parent/child relationship, as the truth would ruin her one last chance. Halfpenny said her portrayal turns Amy to a [...] "dark place" [...] as she is [...] "too young to be coping with something like this." [...] As Amy becomes preoccupied with fear in case Cain finds out, Halfpenny said it makes Amy do [...] "something dangerous." [...] Though, Amy has Victoria {{to fall back on}} and is described as [...] "her rock". Emmerdale series producer Stuart Blackburn said the storyline would change the lives {{of a lot of people}} around Amy. At times he said the narrative is [...] "truly heart breaking" [...] and dangerous. [...] "I think it's going to change perceptions of Amy [...] we’re going to start to understand Amy an awful lot more." ...|$|E
500|$|Halfpenny {{revealed}} that Amy genuinely liked David and thought {{the feeling was}} mutual. [...] "She wouldn't do it to embarrass herself; {{i think that is}} one of Amy's biggest fears being embarrassed." [...] When David tracks Amy down; she blackmails him in return for the truth but David exposes her to Eric. Halfpenny said Amy was hurt by David's deception because she trusted him and despite their problems had a [...] "good relationship". Eric tries to convince Amy to return home to lead the life she had always wanted, because [...] "deep down he really cares about her." [...] The strict parenting role is played once again with Eric, and Halfpenny branded the moment as Amy [...] "meeting her match." [...] As [...] "nothing is straight forward with Amy", she returns home but finds telling the truth hard. Amy settles into village life until Jared Haynes (Philip Hill-Pearson) arrives and blackmails Amy. An Emmerdale spokesperson {{revealed that}} <b>Amy</b> <b>had</b> an affair with Jared's father and ruined his family. [...] "She’s got herself in a mess and this is just the start of her problems." [...] Amy steals from Val and Eric to pay Jared off. At this point in the story Val and Eric [...] "are sick of Amy's bad behaviour." [...] Val refuses to give her any more help.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{there was}} a scene after the four had been reunited in the museum where <b>Amy</b> <b>had</b> a [...] "meltdown" [...] and Rory assured her it was okay; this was cut due to pacing issues, which pleased Darvill as he disliked his {{performance}} in the scene. Gillan stated that the episode was the [...] "most difficult" [...] for her, as it was [...] "a big climax for Amy and her story that's been building through the series...it just required a lot of kind of concentration and emotion." [...] In August 2011 she stated that the Doctor and Amy's farewell was the most emotional scene for her to film. The scene in which the Doctor gives a final speech to young Amelia was not filmed with Smith and Blackwood on the same set. Smith's dialogue was shot first in the bedroom set, while the corner with the bed was recreated and filmed with Blackwood as a pick-up. Blackwood fell asleep during filming. Amy and Rory's wedding reception was filmed at Miskin Manor. Gillan found wearing the dress strange, while Darvill {{felt as if he}} was gate-crashing someone else's wedding, as he did not know any of the extras there. Haynes wanted to first show the revelation that the TARDIS would appear at the reception in a small way with minor changes such as the glasses tinkling and chandelier shaking, and build it up from there. Moffat thought that Amy would want a big wedding with a lot of dancing. In the script it was written that the Doctor was a [...] "terrible dancer" [...] and danced like a [...] "drunk giraffe", and Smith additionally came up with his own routine.|$|E

A look into Gilligan's will established that {{it was actually a}} forgery written by Amy.|$|E
2500|$|For many fans, Mickelson's {{finish in}} the tournament was {{especially}} poignant, given that <b>Amy</b> <b>had</b> been suffering from breast cancer during the preceding year. Mary Mickelson, Phil's mother, was also dealing with cancer. CBS Sports announcer Jim Nantz's call of the final birdie putt, [...] "That's a win for the family," [...] was {{seen by many as}} capturing the moment well.|$|E
2500|$|The {{animosity}} between Ronnie and {{her father}} was explored in July 2008, when Lamb made his first appearance as Archie. Womack believes that the introduction of Archie was [...] "fundamental to Ronnie and how she was perceived by the audience. This was the underbelly of why everything had gone wrong in her life, and so these scenes were {{always going to be}} really, really important." [...] Archie made a death threat against Ronnie, and told her that <b>Amy</b> <b>had</b> died 13 years previously. Lamb commented that Archie had hoped to rectify his problems with Ronnie, but in actuality exacerbated them as she brought out his vicious side. He believes Archie's relationship with Ronnie suffered when he realised that he could not control her. In the EastEnders Revealed documentary [...] "The Secret Mitchell", an EastEnders storyliner suggested that Archie views Ronnie as damaged goods, and is somewhat disgusted by her. Santer stated that Archie told Ronnie her daughter had died as a way of controlling her.|$|E
