5|$|In 1839 <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> was {{discovered}} in the wall of Shaw's bedroom at Bargarron House, which by then had become a local attraction, through which an accomplice may have passed the items she supposedly removed from her mouth.|$|E
5|$|Cave 4 has an open veranda and a cell. The veranda has a bench, {{along the}} back wall. A grooved door leads to a cell, which has a bench along the right wall. A broken window is {{to the left of}} door and to its right, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hole,</b> which could have been used to wash feet before {{entering}} the cell.|$|E
5|$|To develop, {{the larvae}} must be fed both nectar for {{carbohydrates}} and pollen for protein. Bumblebees feed nectar to the larvae by chewing <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> in the brood cell {{into which they}} regurgitate nectar. Larvae are fed pollen {{in one of two}} ways, depending on the bumblebee species. Pocket-making bumblebees create pockets of pollen {{at the base of the}} brood-cell clump from which the larvae feed themselves. Pollen-storing bumblebees keep pollen in separate wax pots and feed it to the larvae.|$|E

5|$|An {{attempt to}} open a sealed chamber using a Borazon drill fails to make progress. However, a few moments after the drill is stopped, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> is seen, though the drill operator, Sladden (Duncan Lamont), is certain it was not created by his machine. The hole widens to reveal the corpses of three-legged, insectoid creatures with horned heads. Roney and Judd work to {{preserve}} the bodies before they decay. An examination of the creatures' physiology suggests {{they came from the}} planet Mars. Quatermass and Roney note the similarity between the appearance of the creatures and images of the Devil.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{assessments}} of Belfasts damage showed that, while the mine had done little direct {{damage to the}} outer hull, causing only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> directly below one of the boiler rooms, {{the shock of the}} explosion had caused severe warping, breaking machinery, deforming the decks and causing the keel to hog (bend upwards) by three inches. On 4 January 1940 Belfast was decommissioned to Care and Maintenance status, becoming the responsibility of Rosyth Dockyard, and her crew dispersed to other vessels. By 28 June she had been repaired sufficiently to sail to Devonport, arriving on 30 June under the command of Lt Cdr H W Parkinson.|$|E
5|$|On September 17, 1992, Apple {{recalled}} 60,000 PowerBook100s {{because of}} a potential safety problem. An electrical short, it was discovered, could melt <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> in the casing, which occurred {{in three of the}} 60,000 notebooks manufactured between October 1991 and March 1992. On the day of the recall, Apple shares closed at $47, down $1.25, but some analysts discounted the recall's importance. In addition, the original power supplies had problems with insulation cracks that could cause a short in a fuse on the motherboard; and the computer was prone to cracks in the power adapter socket on the motherboard, which required a $400 replacement motherboard if the warranty had expired.|$|E

5|$|Typically {{carried out}} by a {{traditional}} circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to puberty and beyond. In half the countries for which national figures are available, most girls are cut {{before the age of}} five. Procedures differ according to the country or ethnic group. They include removal of the clitoral hood and clitoral glans; removal of the inner labia; and removal of the inner and outer labia and closure of the vulva. In this last procedure, known as infibulation, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid; the vagina is opened for intercourse and opened further for childbirth.|$|E
5|$|Bliss {{was left}} in the strong room for three weeks wearing a {{skullcap}} (a heavy vice for the head), thumb screws, iron collar, leg irons, and irons round his ankles called sheers. One witness said the swelling in his legs was so bad that the irons on one side could no longer be seen for overflowing flesh. His wife, who was able to see him through <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> in the door, testified that he was bleeding from the mouth and thumbs. He was given a small amount of food but the skullcap prevented him from chewing; he had to ask another prisoner, Susannah Dodd, to chew his meat for him. He was eventually released from the prison, but his health deteriorated and he died in St. Thomas's Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the South station's demolition in 1996, thousands of pounds were spent on a number of security measures; the site was fenced off, bunding was installed, warning signs were put up and security patrols took place. However, large sections of the fencing were stolen and the warning signs were ignored. Ultimately this led to one man being trapped on the site for five hours on 22May 1997. He had been looking for scrap metal and power cables, and had climbed through <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> into an underground room, from which he had to be rescued by fire crews. The site was then designated a danger zone. The derelict site was vandalised in July 1999, when people hurled burning tyres into the sub-station, creating a fire and damaging cables worth £150,000.|$|E

5|$|Immature fruit {{bodies are}} spherical—somewhat {{resembling}} puffballs with pointed beaks—and are partially or completely {{buried in the}} ground. As the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exoperidium) splits into four to eight pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, lifting and exposing the spherical inner spore sac. The spore sac contains the gleba, a mass of spores and fertile mycelial tissue that when young is white and firm, but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits {{around the perimeter of}} the spore sac so that it appears to rest in a collar or saucer. Atop the spore sac is a small pointed beak, the peristome, which has <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> from which spores may be released.|$|E
5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E
5|$|Cole {{completely}} reprinted {{the minutes}} of an extraordinary meeting of the Royal Institution of December 23, 1820, which show that these events were initiated through an observation made by a librarian of the Royal Institution named Sturt. Sturt reported to his superiors that on November 5, 1820, a number of pages were removed from books in the reading room of the institution, books Accum had read. On the instructions of his superiors, Sturt cut <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> in {{the wall of the}} reading room to watch Accum from an adjoining room. On the evening of December 20, as recorded in the minutes, Sturt could see Accum tear out and walk off with a paper concerning the ingredients and uses of chocolate. The paper had been in an issue of Nicholson’s Journal. Accum's premises on Old Compton Street were searched on the order of a magistrate for the City of London, and torn pages were indeed discovered there. These could be matched to books belonging to the Royal Institution.|$|E

5|$|This isle is for {{the most}} part arable, but rocky in other parts; the mould is brown and clayey, inclining to red; it is good for {{pasturage}} and cultivation. The corn growing here is oats and barley. The cattle bred here are cows, horses, and sheep. There is a church in this island called Kilchattan, it has an altar in the east end, and upon it a font of stone which is very large, and hath <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> in the middle which goes quite through it. There are several tombstones in and about this church; the family of the Macneils, the principal possessors of this isle, are buried under the tombstones on the east side the church, where there is a plot of ground set apart for them. Most of all the tombs have a two-handed sword engraven on them, and there is one that has the representation of a man upon it... This isle affords no wood of any kind, but a few bushes of juniper on the little hills.|$|E
5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E

50|$|The George Deffenbaugh Mound is a Native American mound in {{the southeastern}} part of the U.S. state of Ohio. Located {{northeast}} of Laurelville in Hocking County, the mound sits on a ridgeline; it is 6.5 ft tall and approximately 50 ft in diameter. It was first excavated at an unknown date prior to 1941; at this time, a hole was sunk from the mound's crest to its base, and <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>hole</b> was dug into its edge.|$|R

25|$|In Uruguay and Brazil, the {{traditional}} gourd is usually big with a corresponding large hole. In Argentina (especially {{in the capital}} Buenos Aires), the gourd is small and has <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hole</b> and people sometimes add sugar for flavor.|$|E
25|$|Hysterectomy can be {{performed}} in different ways. The oldest known technique is abdominal incision. Subsequently the vaginal (performing the hysterectomy through the vaginal canal) and later laparoscopic vaginal (with additional instruments inserted through <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hole,</b> frequently close to the navel) techniques were developed.|$|E
25|$|The Kvinneby amulet (Öl SAS1989;43) is an 11th-century runic amulet {{found in}} the mid-1950s buried {{in the village of}} Södra Kvinneby in Öland, Sweden. The amulet is a square copper object {{measuring}} approximately 5cm on each side. Near one edge there is <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hole,</b> presumably used for hanging it around the neck.|$|E
50|$|The {{change in}} speckle size with lens {{aperture}} {{can be observed}} by looking at a laser spot on a wall directly, and then through <b>a</b> very <b>small</b> <b>hole.</b> The speckles will be seen to increase significantly in size.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{entering}} World War I, the United States {{attempted to}} adopt the V-B grenade, {{but this was not}} very successful. The difference between the French and American service cartridges (8 mm vs. 7.62 mm) meant that the grenade had to be re-designed with <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>hole,</b> but even this was not sufficient to ensure reliable functioning, due to differences in bullet design. The American bullet would often break apart in the grenade, and this led to the V-B derived grenade design being scrapped in May 1918.|$|R
50|$|Some plates had two slots for double ropes. The slots {{could also}} be {{different}} sizes for different diameter ropes e.g. 9mm and 11mm. A wide wire spring may be attached on one side {{to help keep the}} plate away from the brake carabiner to ease feeding and taking in rope. <b>A</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>hole</b> is often present for accessory cord to carry the device. Sticht plates are typically forged from aluminium alloy in a round disc shape, although other shapes such as rounded rectangles were also made.|$|R
