40|$|The {{advent of}} {{software}} agents {{gave rise to}} much discussion of just what such an agent is, and of how they differ from programs in general. Here we propose a formal definition of an autonomous agent which clearly distinguishes a software agent from just any program. We also offer {{the beginnings of a}} natural kinds taxonomy of autonomous agents, and discuss possibilities for further classification. Finally, we discuss subagents and multiagent systems. Introduction On meeting a friend or colleague that we haven't seen for a while, or a new acquaintance, some version of the following conversation often ensues: What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> these days? Control structures for autonomous agents. Autonomous agents? What do you mean by that? A brief explanation is then followed by: But agents sound just like computer programs. How are they different?

40|$|Mathematics Meetings, mathematicians had {{far fewer}} ways to communicate. Finished works {{would appear in}} books {{and in a few}} general {{scientific}} and scholarly journals like Acta Eruditorum or the Mémoires de l’Academie des Sciences de Berlin. Euler usually published in the journal of the St. Petersburg Academy, Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae, or one of its successor journals. There are other hidden and informal means of scientific communications that are essential to the health of mathematics. These are the ways we answer questions like “What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>working</b> <b>on?</b> ” or “What have you discovered that you haven’t published yet? ” or “What would be interesting or useful to work on next? ” Within a single department, we get to ask, and sometimes answer these questions personally. To ask them in a larger community, we have eMail and meetings. They couldn’t do that in Euler’s day. Occasionally, someone would go on a “Grand Tour ” and visit scientists in several places. We are only sure that Euler did this once, when he stopped to visit Christian Wolff in the 1720 ’s while moving from Basel to St. Petersburg, though he may have made some shorter trips within Germany in the 1740 ’s and 1750 ’s. Many more people traveled to see Euler, but it wasn’t enough to sustain a scientific conversation...|$|E
40|$|What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>working</b> <b>on?</b> We have {{developed}} GQM+Strategies {{in a joint}} project between Fraunhofer Maryland and IESE. This includes a process, templates, and measureable links between business goals and low level project goals. We use several basic concepts: business goals, context, assumptions, strategies, lower level goals, integrated interpretations of the lower level goals back to the higher level goals. The Goal +Strategies element organizes the goals and strategies influenced by the context and assumptions. The goal is measured and interpreted by a GQM measurement goal. The strategies lead to lower level goals which are then refined into lower level strategies. The basic concepts are: Business Goals: Goals the organization wishes to accomplish in general {{in order to achieve}} its objectives Context Factors: Environmental factors representing the organizational environment Assumptions: Estimated unknowns affecting the interpretation of the data Strategy: A possible approach for achieving a goal that may be refined by a set of concrete activities (i. e., business or development processes) Level i Goals: A set of lower-level goals inherited from level i- 1 goals as part of the level i- 1 goal strategy GQM Goals: Measureable goals associated with each business goal Interpretation Models: Models that help interpret data to determine whether goals at each level is achieved An example of a Goal+Strategies element and a GQM Graph are given below: The detail of the goal are given in a goal template which expresses the activity, focus, object of study, magnitude, timeframe, scope, constraints, and relationship to other goals.

40|$|In marine biology, {{information}} on the locations where a species has been recorded are often stored in a spreadsheet where each line represents an individual record with the positional information held in separate fields for latitude and longitude. In order for these {{to be used in}} GIS, these data generally have to be plotted to create a point data layer. In addition, before the point data layer can be used for any other GIS-based tasks, they will usually need to be transformed from the geographic projection/coordinate system (which uses decimal degrees as its map units) into another more suitable projection/coordinate system, such as the custom transverse mercator projection which will be used in this exercise. This is because the geographic projection/coordinate system is not appropriate for GIS-based tasks which involve measuring distances and areas (see exercise three), or creating many types of raster data layers (see exercise two). The chances <b>are</b> if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> a specific GIS project, you will use the same projection/coordinate system throughout it, and you will find that every time you need to add species locational data from a spreadsheet, you will have to repeatedly go through the same steps over and over again. Under these circumstances, it is worth creating a customised GIS tool which allows you to do all these steps by clicking on a single tool rather than having to do each step manually every time.
