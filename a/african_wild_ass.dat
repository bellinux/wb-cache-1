5|$|Humans {{have had}} {{a great impact on}} the populations of wild equines. Threats to wild equines include habitat {{destruction}} and conflicts with local people and livestock. Since the 20th century, wild equines have been decimated over many of their former ranges and their populations scattered. In recent centuries, two subspecies, the quagga and the tarpan, became extinct. Only the plains zebra remains numerous and widespread. The IUCN lists the <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> as critically endangered, the Grévy's zebra, mountain zebra and Przewalski's horse as endangered, the Onager as vulnerable, the kiang as lower risk and the plains zebra as least concern. The Przewalski's horse was considered to be extinct in the wild from the 1960s to 1996. However, following successful captive breeding, it has been reintroduced in Mongolia.|$|E
5|$|Extant wild equines have {{scattered}} ranges across Africa and Asia. The plains zebra {{lives in}} lush grasslands and savannas of Eastern and Southern Africa, while the Mountain zebra inhabits mountainous areas of southwest Africa. The other equine species tend to occupy more arid environments with more scattered vegetation. The Grévy's zebra {{is found in}} thorny scrubland of East Africa, while the <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> inhabits rocky deserts of North Africa. The two Asian wild ass species live in the dry deserts of the Near East and Central Asia and the Przwelski's wild horse's habitat is the deserts of Mongolia. Only {{the range of the}} plains and Grévy's zebras overlap. In addition to wild populations, domesticated horses and donkeys are widespread thanks to humans. In certain parts of the world, populations of feral horses and feral donkeys exist, which are descended from domesticated animals that were released or escaped into the wild.|$|E
25|$|Few {{species of}} ass {{exist in the}} wild. The <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> Equus africanus, has two subspecies, the Somali wild ass, Equus africanus somaliensis, and the Nubian wild ass, Equus africanus africanus, the {{principal}} ancestor of the domestic donkey. Both are critically endangered. Extinct species include the European ass, Equus hydruntinus, which became extinct during the Neolithic, and the North <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> Equus africanus atlanticus, which became extinct in Roman times.|$|E
50|$|The park lets animals roam freely while {{visitors}} {{drive through}} their enclosures. The species {{held in the}} park include rhinoceros, elands, scimitar horned oryx, addax, gemsbok, giraffes, Ankoles, zebras, <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses,</b> elephants, camels, bisons, bongo, lions, tigers, Canadian timber wolves, black bears, patas monkeys and Barbary apes.|$|R
50|$|While the {{existence}} of several rock art depictions and Roman mosaics leave {{no doubt about the}} former existence of <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> in North Africa, it has been claimed that the original bones that were used to describe the subspecies atlanticus actually belonged to a fossil zebra. Therefore, the name E. a. atlanticus might not be valid to refer to the Atlas <b>wild</b> <b>ass.</b>|$|R
25|$|Leg {{bars are}} {{prominent}} on Grevy's zebras and mountain zebras, and <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> also have well-defined black leg bars below the forearm and gaskin {{on a white}} or pale background. However, as in horses, expression of leg bars seems to vary widely among donkeys, plains zebras, and Przewalski's horses, while they appear very seldom {{or not at all}} in onagers and kiangs.|$|R
25|$|This wild donkey (Equus africanus somalicus) is a {{subspecies}} of the <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass.</b> Zoo Basel coordinates the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) of the Somali wild ass, {{which is}} on the Red List of critically endangered species as there are likely less than 3000 animals in the wild.|$|E
25|$|The Somali {{wild ass}} (Equus africanus somalicus) is a wild donkey, a {{subspecies}} of the <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass.</b> It is extremely endangered, {{as there are}} likely less than 1000 animals (or even 700) in the wild. There are about 200 individuals in zoos around the globe, of which 35 were born in Basel.|$|E
25|$|The Afar Depression biome is {{characterized}} as desert scrubland. Vegetation is mostly confined to drought-resistant {{plants such as}} small trees (e.g. species of the dragon tree), shrubs, and grasses. Wildlife includes many herbivores such as Grevy's zebra, Soemmering's gazelle, beisa and, notably, the last viable population of <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus africanus somalicus).|$|E
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> {{are well}} suited to life in a desert or semidesert environment. They have tough {{digestive}} systems, which can break down desert vegetation and extract moisture from food efficiently. They can also go without water for a fairly long time. Their large ears give them an excellent sense of hearing and help in cooling.Because of the sparse vegetation in their environment <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> live somewhat separated from each other (except for mothers and young), unlike the tightly grouped herds of wild horses. They have very loud voices, which can be heard for over 3 km, which helps them to keep in contact with other asses over the wide spaces of the desert.|$|R
50|$|Southern {{populations of}} onagers in the Middle East and South Asia {{tend to have}} a purely {{territorial}} life, where areas partly overlap. Dominant stallions home ranges of 9 km2, but can also be significantly larger. These territories include food and rest stops and permanent or periodic water sources. The waters are but usually {{at the edge of a}} coalfield and not in the center. Frequently committed paths with feces and marked urine, where often the same marker points are used. Mares with foals sometimes find themselves also to small groups, the areas of up to 20 km2 which overlap with those of the other groups and dominant stallions. Such features are seen in Grévy's zebras (Equus grevyi) and the <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses.</b>|$|R

25|$|Lions {{are said}} to inhabit the {{mountains}} of the Gash-Barka Region. There is also a small population of African bush elephants that roam {{in some parts of}} the country. Dik-diks can also be found in many areas. The endangered <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> can be seen in Denakalia Region. Other local wildlife include bushbuck, duikers, greater kudu, Klipspringer, African leopards, oryx and crocodiles., The spotted hyena is widespread and fairly common.|$|E
25|$|The donkey or ass (Equus africanus asinus) is a domesticated {{member of}} the horse family, Equidae. The wild {{ancestor}} of the donkey is the <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> E. africanus. The donkey {{has been used as}} a working animal for at least 5000 years. There are more than 40 million donkeys in the world, mostly in underdeveloped countries, where they are used principally as draught or pack animals. Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels. Small numbers of donkeys are kept for breeding or as pets in developed countries.|$|E
25|$|The Eastern Desert has a quite {{different}} range of fauna and has {{much in common with}} the Sinai Peninsula, showing the importance of the broad Nile in separating the two desert regions. Here are found the striped hyena, Nubian ibex, bushy-tailed jird, golden spiny mouse, Blanford's fox and Rüppell's fox. The sand partridge, streaked scrub warbler, mourning wheatear and white-crowned wheatear are typical of this region. The high rocky mountains of Gebel Elba in the south have a distinctive range of animals including the aardwolf, striped polecat, and common genet, and there may still be <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> in this area.|$|E
5000|$|Wildlife such as hamadryas baboons, Soemmerring's gazelle, dorcas gazelle, warthog, black-backed jackal, Ruppells sandfox, dikdik, African golden wolf, hyena, Abyssinian hare, <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> and {{ostriches}} {{are found}} in this region. <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> dog was also found in this region, but their present condition is unknown. There have been reports of cheetah occurring in this region, {{but there has been}} no evidence of their presence. It is extremely likely that both cheetah and wild dog are extinct in Eritrea.|$|R
50|$|The Badhyz State Nature Reserve is an {{important}} stronghold of the Asiatic <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus hemionus kulan). It was once the last place where the Turkmenian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> was found. The <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> population increased from 200, when the reserve was founded to 5000 animals. After a strong decline, there are now about 650 <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> in the sanctuary.|$|R

25|$|Of equids {{other than}} horses, all except the {{mountain}} zebra show a distinct dorsal stripe. Among domesticated donkeys, most {{have a black}} dorsal stripe, though {{it can be difficult}} to see on melanistic individuals. In the <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> the dorsal stripe is thin but distinct and black. In Przewalski's horse, the dorsal stripe is usually dark brown, while it is black in the bred-back tarpan. In the plains zebra, the dorsal stripe is narrow and edged by white, while in Grevy's zebra, it is quite bold. The dorsal stripes of the onager and kiang are dark brown and especially vivid.|$|E
2500|$|Asses {{were first}} domesticated around 3000BC, {{probably}} in Egypt or Mesopotamia, [...] and have {{spread around the}} world. They continue to fill important roles in many places today. [...] While domesticated species are increasing in numbers, [...] the <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> is an endangered species. As beasts of burden and companions, asses and donkeys have worked together with humans for millennia.|$|E
2500|$|Most [...] "wild" [...] horses today, {{such as the}} American mustang or the Australian brumby, are {{actually}} feral horses descended from domesticated animals that escaped and adapted {{to life in the}} wild. In contrast, the Przewalski's horse has never been domesticated and remains the only true wild horse in the world today. Przewalski's horse is one of three known subspecies of Equus ferus, the others being the domesticated horse Equus ferus caballus, and the extinct tarpan Equus ferus ferus. There are still a number of other wild equines, including three species of zebra and various subspecies of the <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> onager (including the Mongolian wild ass), and kiang.|$|E
50|$|The {{wildlife}} sanctuary {{was established in}} 1972 and came under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.

50|$|A the {{previous}} census in 2009, estimated 4,038 Indian <b>wild</b> <b>ass.</b> However, {{the population was}} still growing. In December 2014, the population was estimated at 4,451 individuals. It has increased from a jump of 454. However, as of 2015, the current Indian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> population has increased to more than 4,800 individuals in {{and outside of the}} <b>Wild</b> <b>Ass</b> Wildlife Sanctuary of India.|$|R
50|$|First {{census of}} the <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> {{was done in}} 1940, when there were an {{estimated}} 3,500 <b>wild</b> <b>asses.</b> But, by the year 1960, this figure fell to just 362, it was then classified as a highly endangered species. In the years 1973 & 1976, Rann of Kutch and adjoining districts were taken up as the area for conservation for this sub-species also known as Khur. From 1976, the forest department began conducting the <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> census. Water holes were increased in the area, the forest department has also started a project for having fodder plots though the forest department is yet to get desired success. In 1998, the <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> population was estimated at 2,940, by the year 2004 it has increased to an estimated 3,863.

2500|$|The {{ancestors}} of the modern donkey are the Nubian and Somalian subspecies of <b>African</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass.</b> Remains of domestic donkeys dating to the fourth millennium BC {{have been found in}} Ma'adi in Lower Egypt, and it is believed that the domestication of the donkey was accomplished long after the domestication of cattle, sheep and goats in the seventh and eighth millennia BC. Donkeys were probably first domesticated by pastoral people in Nubia, and they supplanted the ox as the chief pack animal of that culture. The domestication of donkeys served to increase the mobility of pastoral cultures, having the advantage over ruminants of not needing time to chew their cud, and were vital in the development of long-distance trade across Egypt. In the Dynasty IV era of Egypt, between 2675 and 2565 BC, wealthy members of society were known to own over 1,000 donkeys, employed in agriculture, as dairy and meat animals and as pack animals. [...] In 2003, the tomb of either King Narmer or King Hor-Aha (two of the first Egyptian pharaohs) was excavated and the skeletons of ten donkeys were found buried in a manner usually used with high ranking humans. These burials show the importance of donkeys to the early Egyptian state and its ruler.|$|E
