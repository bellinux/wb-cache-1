40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} and compare the perceptions of the meaning of death to persons diagnosed with terminal cancer and persons diagnosed with end-stage AIDS. The conceptual orientation for this study was Jean Watson's theory of human care, particularly the holistic individual. This study used a descriptive design for secondary analysis of interview responses from an original study. The analysis explored the personal meaning of death to persons with cancer and persons with AIDS in the last six months of life. Content analysis was the method of data analysis used to address the research questions. Identified categories representing meaning of death to persons with cancer were: Acceptance, Release, Reluctance, and Spiritual Awareness. Categories representing meaning of death for persons with AIDS were: Uncertainty, Acceptance, <b>Anticipatory</b> <b>Loss,</b> Fear, Benefits, and Spiritual Awareness. Comparison revealed the two subsamples shared the categories of Acceptance and Spiritual Awareness...|$|E
40|$|We aim to {{describe}} Japanese palliative care nurses' expenence {{of loss and}} grief. Better understanding will guide the development of psychoeducational and supportive interventions. A qualitative study was undertaken with 13 Japanese nurses working in palliative care units in Japan. Face-to-face in-depth interviews lasted 55 to 90 minutes and were transcribed, and grounded theory was used to analyze data. Four major sources of <b>loss</b> were identified: <b>anticipatory</b> grief, <b>loss</b> of their relationships with patients, overlap with personal loss experiences, and loss of professional self-esteem. Cultural elements such as longer hospitalization {{and the use of}} primary nursing systems were contributory factors. Nurses seek to honor both life and death. Some found meaning in their caregiving as a sustaining source of res ience despite their experience of grief. Nurses grief was both cumulative and disenfranchised, being unrecognized by society and sometimes themselves. Support systems are vital to avoid burnout...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To {{document}} short- {{and long-term}} trajectories {{of depressive symptoms}} following widowhood and to test whether these trajectories vary by gender and <b>anticipatory</b> spousal <b>loss.</b> Method. Eight waves of prospective panel data from the Health and Retirement Study, over a 14 -year period, are used to evaluate gender differences in depressive symptoms following widowhood in late midlife. Short-term trajectories are modeled using a linear regression of change in Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) score on duration of widowhood. Long-term trajectories are modeled using a mixed-effects hierarchical linear model of CES-D scores over time. Results. We find no gender differences in bereavement effects on depressive symptoms in either short or long term, net of widowhood duration. When spousal death is anticipated, {{both men and women}} return to their prewidowhood levels of depressive symptoms within 24 months of becoming widowed. Across marital groups, the continuously married are better off compared with the widowed even prior to spousal loss, whereas early, long-term widowhood is associated with worse outcomes compared with late widowhood. Discussion. Although men and women do not differ in trajectories of depressive symptoms following widowhood, given similar circumstances, women are distinctly disadvantaged in that {{they are more likely to}} become widowed and under less favorable conditions...|$|R
40|$|Two {{focus group}} {{interviews}} with 15 relatives, investigated family caregiversâ€™ perceptions {{of having a}} relative in a dementia care unit. Data analysis revealed the significant theme of living with loss. The results demonstrate that the burden of care giving creates growing stress and tension that continues even when the family member is placed into a residential care setting. The findings suggest that health professionals {{must be prepared to}} assist family members with the <b>anticipatory</b> grieving of <b>losses</b> that accrue with the changing relationship with the relative and health care staff. Furthermore, {{there is a need to}} look for a means of helping and supporting family caregivers so that they can develop a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment in their care giving role.

40|$|In Canada, over 23, 000 {{women are}} {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer annually with approximately 19 % of these women under the age of 50. Younger women {{diagnosed with breast}} cancer often have inferior survival rates and higher recurrence rates compared to older women. The purpose of this research was to bring attention to younger women's experiences with distress from the time they are informed of a breast detected abnormality requiring biopsy until a diagnosis is confirmed. The study focused on women 50 years of age or younger and who were pre-menopausal. [...] The breast cancer discourse often focuses on women's ability or inability to adapt or cope with a diagnosis of breast cancer. Feminist epistemologies of standpoint theories provided a theoretical framework to guide this study to understand the structural organization {{of the health care system}} that may induce or exacerbate distress from younger women's point of view. Principles of Feminist Participatory Action Research were applied as part of the methodology to engage young women in a dialogue to share their personal experiences and make recommendations for the health care system to be more responsive to younger women's breast health needs. [...] The uniqueness of this qualitative study is that 14 younger women were interviewed prospectively prior and after diagnosis. Research methods included 28 in-depth interviews and two focus groups; participants also kept journals. Data was analyzed using a voice centered relational method. Three themes are discussed as part of the findings: (1) The Unexpected: Finding of a Breast Problem and the Beginning of <b>Anticipatory</b> Illness- <b>Loss</b> of Innocence, The Vulnerability of Living with the Unknown, The 'Being' in Being a Patient and Mobilizing Support While Caring for Others. (2) The Journey from the other Side- I don't have Breast Cancer. (3) The Journey from the Other Side- I have breast cancer. [...] The research undertaken brings awareness to the experiences of younger women undergoing a breast cancer investigation who have defined distress from their perspective with the hope that the deli very of health care policy and services, including psychosocial services, at time of breast biopsy and diagnosis can be improved...|$|R
