40|$|Motivation: Storing, {{transmitting}} and archiving data {{produced by}} next-generation sequencing {{is a significant}} computational burden. New compression techniques tailored to short-read sequence data are needed. Results: We present here an approach to compression that reduces the difficulty of managing large-scale sequencing data. Our novel approach sits between pure reference-based compression and reference-free compression and combines much of the benefit of reference-based approaches with the flexibility of de novo encoding. Our method, called path encoding, draws a connection between storing paths in de Bruijn graphs and context-dependent arithmetic coding. Supporting this method is a system to compactly store sets of kmers that is of independent interest. We are able to encode RNA-seq reads using 3 – 11 % of {{the space of the}} sequence in raw FASTA files, which is on average more than 34 % smaller than competing approaches. We also show that even if the reference is very poorly matched to the reads that are being encoded, good compression can still be <b>achieved.</b> <b>Availability</b> and implementation: Source code and binaries freely available for download a...|$|E

In this paper, we take an availabilitycentric view on QoS and focus on the issues of providing availability guarantees for distributed and replicated multimedia services and contents. For this purpose, we develop a concept called quality of availability (QoA) in which the availability is treated as a new controllable QoS parameter. We especially tackle the replica placement (RP) problem and study the effects of number and location of replicas on the <b>achieved</b> <b>availability.</b> We decompose the RP problem into three sub-problems: (1) finding a "good" placement for a fixed number of replicas, (2) checking the reached QoA with a selected replica placement, and (3) determining the number and location of replicas for satisfying a requiredQoA. For each RP sub-problem, we review existing related work for algorithms ranging from heuristic to exact methods as well as devise new algorithms where existing work is lacking and evaluate their achieved QoA. Based on a simulation study, we find that (1) the location of replica is a more relevant factor than their number for satisfying the QoA requirements by different users, and (2) the heuristic methods, in general, cannot give any guarantee for their achieved QoA, even though they are very efficient for large size graphs.

40|$|This code allows to {{generate}} a MEX function {{to be used in}} Matlab environment for reliability indices evaluation such as inherent availability and <b>achieved</b> <b>availability</b> of radio communication devices depending on preventive maintenance periodicity. The code is based on a Monte Carlo simulation model of Semi-Markov process corresponded to the operational process of the mentioned facilities. The model takes into account the following exploitation factors: sudden, gradual, latent and fictitious failures, a human factor of service staff and time parameters of maintenance. Consequently, the model considers eight possible states: operable state, misalignment state, non-operable state, preventive maintenance of the operative system, maintenance of the system with misalignment, latent failure, maintenance of system being in latent failure and fictitious failure. This model can be utilized for the analysis of reliability and optimization of maintenance periodicity of radio electronic and communication facilities whose operational process is assumed to be described by the above-mentioned states. The function Preventive Maintenance Semi-Markov Process (PMSMP) is proposed {{to be used as a}} multivariant analysis module whose work is stopped automatically when calculations achieve the allowable level of inherent availability set in model input parameters. This automatic stop feature is added in order to use the multivariant analysis module as a part of a CAD system of preventive maintenance schedule radio communication equipment.

40|$|It is {{essential}} that management and engineering understand {{the need for an}} availability requirement for the customer's space transportation system as it enables the meeting of his needs, goal, and objectives. There are three types of availability, e. g., operational availability, <b>achieved</b> <b>availability,</b> or inherent availability. The basic definition of availability is equal to the mean uptime divided by the sum of the mean uptime plus the mean downtime. The major difference is the inclusiveness of the functions within the mean downtime and the mean uptime. This paper will address tIe inherent availability which only addresses the mean downtime as that mean time to repair or the time to determine the failed article, remove it, install a replacement article and verify the functionality of the repaired system. The definitions of operational availability include the replacement hardware supply or maintenance delays and other non-design factors in the mean downtime. Also with inherent availability the mean uptime will only consider the mean time between failures (other availability definitions consider this as mean time between maintenance - preventive and corrective maintenance) that requires the repair of the system to be functional. It is also essential that management and engineering understand all influencing attributes relationships {{to each other and to}} the resultant inherent availability requirement. This visibility will provide the decision makers with the understanding necessary to place constraints on the design definition for the major drivers that will determine the inherent availability, safety, reliability, maintainability, and the life cycle cost of the fielded system provided the customer. This inherent availability requirement may be driven by the need to use a multiple launch approach to placing humans on the moon or the desire to control the number of spare parts required to support long stays in either orbit or on the surface of the moon or mars. It is the intent of this paper to provide the visibility of relationships of these major attribute drivers (variables) to each other and the resultant system inherent availability, but also provide the capability to bound the variables providing engineering the insight required to control the system's engineering solution. An example of this visibility will be the need to provide integration of similar discipline functions to allow control of the total parts count of the space transportation system. Also the relationship visibility of selecting a reliability requirement will place a constraint on parts count to achieve a given inherent availability requirement or accepting a larger parts count with the resulting higher reliability requirement. This paper will provide an understanding for the relationship of mean repair time (mean downtime) to maintainability, e. g., accessibility for repair, and both mean time between failure, e. g., reliability of hardware and the system inherent availability. Having an understanding of these relationships and resulting requirements before starting the architectural design concept definition will avoid considerable time and money required to iterate the design to meet the redesign and assessment process required to achieve the results required of the customer's space transportation system. In fact the impact to the schedule to being able to deliver the system that meets the customer's needs, goals, and objectives may cause the customer to compromise his desired operational goal and objectives resulting in considerable increased life cycle cost of the fielded space transportation system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Availability is an {{important}} security property for Internet services and a key ingredient of most service level agreements. It can be compromised by distributed Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In this work we propose a formal pattern-based approach to study defense mech-anisms against DoS attacks. We enhance pattern descriptions with for-mal models that allow the designer to give guarantees {{on the behavior of}} the proposed solution. The underlying executable specification for-malism we use is the rewriting logic language Maude and its real-time and probabilistic extensions. We introduce the notion of stable availabil-ity, which means that with very high probability service quality remains very close to a threshold, regardless of how bad the DoS attack can get. Then we present two formal patterns which can serve as defenses against DoS attacks: the Adaptive Selective Verification (ASV) pattern, which enhances a communication protocol with a defense mechanism, and the Server Replicator (SR) pattern, which provisions additional resources on demand. However, ASV <b>achieves</b> <b>availability</b> without stability, and SR cannot <b>achieve</b> stable <b>availability</b> at a reasonable cost.
