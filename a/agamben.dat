To explore what this might mean in concrete geographical terms, this paper considers the events in West Germany {{in the autumn of}} 1977, when the deadly escalation of conflict between the Red Army Fraction (RAF) and the West German federal state reached its bloody apex. The intense efforts by the Federal Criminal Bureau (BKA) to render visible the network of places and modes of travel used by the RAF in its terrorist activities, and the impacts this effort had on ?normal? social spaces, highlight the importance of the geographical and epistemological prerequisites that underlie the possibility of a ?nationalization? of spaces of exception.

My research of Celans poetic gesture wants to make it clear, how Celan has made it, his poems as a positive reply to Adornos famous line: “To write a poem after Auschwitz is barbaric” to represent. Through the research of Celans poetic change of gesture can we see a “new” way of writing after Holocaust. The conceptual point between poetic writing and the performative gesture will through theoretical approach to the definition of the gesture-concept explained. Giorgio <b>Agambens</b> and Alain Badious’s philosophy serves as the theoretical basis in my paper, from there comes the perspective, which leads to a new concept of gesture. The change of gesture will be characterized as a process, that begins from his early work till the last time. The poem analysis and poetological analysis will be supplied in my paper, to release that change of gesture...|$|R
25|$|For this reason, Bauman {{argues that}} modern {{societies}} have not fully taken {{on board the}} lessons of the Holocaust; it is generally viewed – to use Bauman's metaphor – like a picture hanging on a wall, offering few lessons. In Bauman's analysis, the Jews became 'strangers' par excellence in Europe; the Final Solution was pictured by him as an extreme example of the attempts made by societies to excise the uncomfortable and indeterminate elements existing within them. Bauman, like the philosopher Giorgio <b>Agamben,</b> contended that the same processes of exclusion that were at work in the Holocaust could, and to an extent do, still come into play today.|$|E
25|$|Gould is {{a popular}} subject of {{biography}} and even critical analysis. Philosophers such as Giorgio <b>Agamben</b> and Mark Kingwell have interpreted Gould's life and ideas. References to Gould and his work are plentiful in poetry, fiction, and the visual arts. François Girard's Genie Award winning 1993 film, Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould includes documentary interviews with people who knew him, dramatizations of scenes from Gould's life, and fanciful segments including an animation set to music. Thomas Bernhard's renowned 1983 novel The Loser (Der Untergeher) purports to be an extended first-person essay about Gould and his lifelong friendship with two fellow students from the Mozarteum school in Salzburg, both of whom have abandoned their careers as concert pianists due to the intimidating example of Gould's genius.|$|E

40|$|The paper aims {{to search}} for an {{alternate}} narrative of urban design within the complexities and the contradictions of the current production of urban spaces. In doing so it adopts a broader conception of design and position the reflection along the thematic context of the informal squat-occupation urban realities. It presents a conceptual elaboration around Giorgio <b>Agambens</b> ontology and political aesthetics as an aggregate source toward a possible (re) calibration of the approach to urban design research and practice. Playing with the topos and the gesture of neoliberal urban design, and framing it into the wider background of the current trends of gated urbanisms and hyper symbolic urban regeneration, the paper explores the notion of profanation as act capable to unlock and enhance new modes of politics. The centrality of the act of profanation is seen through the lenses of a design research initiative in Rome not simply as a productive antidote to the sacred phenomenon of urban design and its gesture imposed on humanity from the above, but as a site of resistance in reclaiming, above all, a capacity of speech for an otherwise displaced and silenced urban subject and, along with it, the intellectual productivity of urban design theory and practice themselves...|$|R

This November (2014) saw the publication of an entire monograph devoted to the quarreling couple: David Crowes Cosmic Defiance: Updikes Kierkegaard and The Maples Stories (Mercer University Press). Longer ago (Fall 2012), I myself published in The John Updike Review {{an analysis of the}} eighteen discrete but cyclical works that make up the volume. Titling it `Nothing Real Succeeds: Domestic Dissolution in John Updikes The Maples Stories, I argue that the Maples fail to honor gratuity and thereby turn their marriage into a scoreboard. This spring I would like to adopt the Maples quantitative approach and count the number of references to nude art in the tenth story, the one that stands penultimate to the couples separating (called, helpfully, Separating) and explicate the several connections between revelations of humanness and instances of nakedness in the story by that name. Not only does Nakedness study a youthful couple on a nude beach near the tame familial beach the Maples frequent, but it also focuses on the day Richard was on his own mowing grass and stripped down, only to find himself covered with red ants. It concludes with Joans inadvertent stripteasing preparation for bed while saying no to Richards leering attempt at seducing a wife with whom he lives in what has become deep spiritual estrangement. By surrounding with thick description each of the paintings, sculptures, and literary allusions that litter the storys pages, I argue that we can decipher a redemption of sorts in the refuse of their union. Updike himself published two volumes on art commentary: Just Looking: Essays on Art (1989) and Still Looking: Essays on American Art (2005), both of which privilege nude subjects. Giorgio <b>Agambens</b> 2011 Nudities distinguishes at length between nakedness and the nude and then searches ways in which they become apertures onto truth. Finally, Kenneth Clarks 1953 The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form interrogates the evolving expectations of Western Civilization, a civilization in which the nude female has become a central symbol of high culture, a symbol which likely also informs the disjunction between expectation and reality in {{the marriage}} at the heart of The Maples Stories. With Updikes, <b>Agambens,</b> and Clarks help, I will explicate the richness of that disjunction. Word Count: 46...|$|R
40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} approach {{is needed to}} critique the frequently invoked but seldom questioned notion of "human dignity," a discursive tool that is subtly serving abusive power structures while seemingly promoting human rights. The discourse of human dignity misrepresents the meaning of empowerment for modern citizens, making them interested more in political gestures and less in profit, comfort and protection from abuse. Dignity?s epistemes?self-assertion, recognition, political action, public-spiritedness, responsibility, resistance, the denial of animal instinct, sacrifice?should not be human ideals, for they are exactly {{the opposite of the}} sovereign?s characteristics and because they are responsible for recursive violence that preserves the status quo. They should be replaced with ethics based on sensuous interest, instinct, and natural-spiritedness (a sense of mystical oneness with other living beings). This dissertation answers Foucault?s question about how the modern state endows citizens with a political subjectivity while simultaneously subjecting them to a totalized system, exposing human dignity as just the link between individuation and totalization. It questions <b>Agamben?s</b> notion of the indistinction between political life and natural life, arguing that sovereign power, using the discourse of human dignity, creates a clear distinction. The human dignity discourse keeps the human within political life, representing such life as the middle point between the instinctive life of the animal and the mechanical life of the laborer. In reality, the dissertation shows, these two demonized modes of life are the same mode, which should be championed as a valuable and empowered state of being. In the literary field, a close examination reveals that J. M. Coetzee?s fiction subverts the human dignity discourse while Kazuo Ishiguro?s work is enmeshed in it. Coetzee generates sympathy for humans who lack the sense of human dignity and act on mere instinct. He offers ?disgrace? as a spiritual-ethical state of sensuality, acceptance and humility and promotes an agenda of desire-based rights in lieu of dignity-based ones. His writings also eschew authorial dignity as they discount the values of newness and originality in favor of expression attuned to desire, even when such moves appear selfish and politically irresponsible...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the ways in}} which articulations of Moroccan, Maghrebi, and African identity are represented in Moroccan literature of clandestine migration. While the texts that comprise this subgenre mainly thematize both the precipitating factors that lead migrants to undertake dangerous journeys across hostile landscapes and life-threatening seas and the fraught outcomes of their odysseys, they implicitly broach issues of identity formation and deformation as well. In particular, the texts address how identity construction and its obverse are articulated along (as well as across and athwart) lines of race, region, and nation. Moreover, in these and other instances, identity formations are represented as being not so much in conflict (either internally or in relation to other formations) but in a state of implosive and irredeemable emergency. Concomitantly, covert emigration to Europe is portrayed as a rational if desperate response not just too strictly economic constrictions, but also to the ongoing crisis of the post-colonial nation of which the subgenre is an effect and which it depicts. After surveying some of the key ways in which questions of identity manifest themselves across the subgenre, I will focus on how I teach two key texts from the corpus, Laila Lalamis collection of inter-related stories Hope and Other Dangerous Pursuits and Mahi Binebines novel Welcome to Paradise. I will discuss how I get students to consider some of the strategies by means of which the texts contest reified notions of race, region, and nation, especially insofar as the latter are inflected by gender. One of my goals in teaching these texts is to illustrate how in implicitly denouncing the plight of subjects who are forced to leave their homes and home countries, the texts also lend textured aesthetic substance to Giorgio <b>Agambens</b> twofold contention that the apparently marginal figure of the refugee fundamentally calls in question the seeming cohesion between nation, state, and territory and his concomitant claim {{that as a result of}} their power to destabilize seemingly given categories of identity construction refugees ought to be regarded as central figures of our contemporary world-historical moment. Lastly, I will also discuss how I connect the real-life dramas that these Moroccan texts mediate through fiction with analogous situations along the United States- Mexico border. I will explain how I encourage US students to think of these border-crossing texts not just as agents of critique, but also as harbingers of a different global order...|$|R
40|$|The first aim of {{this study}} is to discuss and try to {{understand}} the relationship between the holy and ethics, and more specifically how it can be understood, which is the critical question that I have formulated, in Giorgio Agamben’s and Emmanuel Levinas’ philosophies. The second, more constructive aim is to discuss whether the holy can be understood as something good or problematic in relation to the society. Rooted in philosophy of religion and ethics, I have first tried to discuss how the holy has been understood in the philosophy of phenomenology and in the texts of Rudolf Otto, Mircea Eliade and Espen Dahl. The holy has in the history been understood as something central in religions, and has also not been connected to the idea of ethics. Recently it has also been critized – by Dahl – for not being so pure as first thought of. In Levinas texts the holy has been understood as something differentiated through his distiction, in the Talmudic reading ”Desacralization and Disenchantment”, between the holy, which can be seen as something pure, and the sacred which can been seen as something impure and a form of degenerated holiness. In Levinas’ other texts Totality and Infinity and Otherwise than being the holy has not been the central theme but has in the essay been, for instance, formulated as the Other as the trace of the holy. In <b>Agambens</b> texts the holy has been more univocal, much because it has been the central theme in his later works, in the series ”Homo Sacer”. Homo sacer (a life that cannot be sacrificed and yet may be killed), the state of exception, the idea of messianism and messianic time, the idea of Levi’s paradox and profanation have formulated an critic of ethics, as a means without ends and an ethics outside the law which is pure, profane and free; as a striving for a realization of a real state of exception, which is open to the possibility to act and think in free regin. I have seen and drawn some similarities between Agamben’s and Levinas’ understanding of the holy, concerning the holy as a position that is exposed, and also as something central in their ideas. There are also dissimilarities concerning their views on ethics, and their view of religion and God. The holy can be seen as both something good and problematic in relation to the society...|$|R

50|$|Italian philosopher Giorgio <b>Agamben</b> {{takes up}} the {{intersecting}} concepts of form-of-life, rule-following and use, but besides attempting to deconstruct what Wittgenstein meant, traces these concepts genealogically, {{in the manner of}} Stirner or Rousseau. In The Highest Poverty - Monastic Rules and Form-of-Life, <b>Agamben</b> looks at the emerging genre of written rules starting in the 9th century, and its development into both law and something beyond law in the Franciscan form-of-life, in which the Franciscans replaced the idea that we possess our life (or objects generally) with the concept of 'usus', that is 'use'. <b>Agamben</b> finds earlier versions of form-of-life in monastic rules, developing from 'vita vel regula', 'regula et vita', 'forma vivendi', and 'forma vitae'. Thus <b>Agamben</b> takes Wittgenstein's concepts and applies them to the history of Western monasticism in order to rethink the consequences of these concepts for doing (contemporary) politics — the main goal of his Homo Sacer-project, which started with Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life and to which The Highest Poverty belongs.|$|E
