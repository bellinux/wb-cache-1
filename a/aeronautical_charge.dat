In order to eliminate the potential of airports to exercise market power and protect the public interest, it has become increasingly necessary to set a common regulatory framework. We intend to discuss the need for a single regulator in Europe to monitor or establish the quality of service and the charges practiced by the airports, to ensure cost-relatedness, transparency and non-discrimination. The existing regulatory approaches regarding <b>aeronautical</b> <b>charges</b> and their economic implications are also analyzed.

The {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Tourism Management [© Elsevier] is available at: [URL] paper explores the way in which airports have responded to the apparent opportunities afforded them by the growth of lowcost airlines. The adoption of a so-called low-cost model by airlines has made many airports fundamentally reconsider who their customers are. The low-cost model impels airlines to negotiate contracts which significantly reduce <b>aeronautical</b> <b>charges</b> by the airport, consequently seeking to make up this short fall by commercial revenues from the increased passenger numbers. This is not however without consequences for the airports, their passengers and the relationship between the airport and its existing airline operators. The recent growth of low-cost airlines has naturally attracted the attention of airport managers as a source of volume to alleviate commercial pressures; however, due to low-cost airlines’ unwillingness to pay high airport fees there is the difficulty of translating any increased volume of passengers into increased revenue.

40|$|The {{aviation}} industry is {{in a state}} of radical antagonisms. Passengers demand quick and cheap transport on the one hand, but expect the highest comfort in terms of service, schedule convenience or non-stop travel on the other hand. The development of more efficient and economical aircraft supports the trend of falling tariffs together with better accessibility. Aspects of comfort on the ground as well as in the air are changing, since falling yields force airlines to reconsider their strategies to attract passengers. The market has become instabile somehow. Customers have interesting choices, when it comes to select the favourite airline for their European-Asian travel. They are free to choose the transfer point of their journey. Dubai has emerged to become a reasonable alternative to the overcrowded classic mega-hubs (London, Paris or Frankfurt) in Europe. The airport convinces with little minimum connecting times, low <b>aeronautical</b> <b>charges</b> and a growing number of new destinations.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{sets out}} to identify what commercialisation has meant within a New Zealand airport context and how {{the requirements of the}} Airport Authorities Act 1966 have been achieved. Section 4 (3) of the Airport Authorities Act 1966 states that "[e]very airport operated or managed by an airport authority must be operated or managed as a commercial undertaking. " No definition of what commercial, managed or operated means is provided within the Act. This objective will be achieved by initially outlining the developments of airports in New Zealand from the end of World War I until 1985, discussing the drive to commercialise them from 1985; providing a contemporary management perspective of managers within some of those airports; considering case studies of the largest seven airports in New Zealand, and analysing the sum of these seven companies for the first 20 years. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the commercialisation that has occurred. Since the mid- 1980 s the airport industry in New Zealand has been substantially reformed. This occurred as part of the public sector reforms during the 15 year period from 1984 and was intended to decrease the role of central government in business activities and to foster a more commercial perspective to various sectors. These developments {{can be traced back to}} the fourth Labour Government that came into power in 1984 and instigated wide ranging economic reforms. In terms of the management and operation of airports within New Zealand a major policy development occurred in 1985 when the Minister of Civil Aviation announced airports, owned at that time as joint ventures by both local and central government, would be encouraged to become limited liability companies. This commercialisation of the principal airports subsequently took place during a three year period from 1998 - 1990 (Minister of Civil Aviation and Meteorological Services, 1985). Following to this commercialisation the ownership of these companies has undergone significant change to include private and institutional shareholding. In some instances central government no longer has any equity in major New Zealand airports, such as Auckland and Wellington, but local government ownership has increased. There is currently no clear and articulated national airport policy within New Zealand. Since the initial commercialisation, and subsequent partial privatisation in some cases, the major airport companies have largely chosen their own paths to follow in terms of how they develop individually as commercial entities. A consequence of the ability of the airport companies to develop as businesses in the absence of price regulation has been of increasing concern to airlines, wary that airport companies may be abusing their position as monopoly providers in particular regions, in terms of charges imposed upon airline users. These concerns resulted in the New Zealand Commerce Commission completing a study in August 2002, that had earlier been initiated in 1998, regarding the need, or otherwise to regulate airports. The Commerce Commission (2002) in its report recommended price regulation at Auckland Airport but did not state the form that such regulation should take. This recommendation has not subsequently been implemented by central government. However during the life of the study, the government implemented a set of Disclosure Regulations that applied to companies earning more than $ 10 million per financial year. Later in 2007 the government announced that it was commencing a study into ways in which the <b>aeronautical</b> <b>charges</b> levied by the major airport companies could be controlled via new provisions in the Commerce Act 1986. It is not anticipated that any such changes to the existing legislation will come into effect before 2012...|$|R

In this paper, we worked with an <b>aeronautical</b> company in <b>charge</b> of electrical maintenance. Its objective was to improve its business pro-cesses, from design phase to production phase, by developing a new PLM system, integrated to its electrical CAD software. Our research aim is to evaluate the genericity of previous knowledge modelling approach in this electrical context. We propose then an integrated knowledge model based on three dimensions: (electric) product modelling, (aeronautics retrofitting) process/project modelling and organization/collaboration modelling. We show how this model identifies generic vs expert knowledge and how ‘business rules’ can be defined to support collaboration and to reduce time of development process.

This PLM system is actually developed by an electrical CAD editor, ensuring the integration between CAD data and PLM database.

40|$|Some {{countries}} (e. g. the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand) {{have recently}} reviewed how they regulate the pricing of <b>aeronautical</b> services (landing <b>charges,</b> aircraft parking charges, terminal facility charges etc.) at their principal airports. One major {{issue that has}} emerged from each of these reviews is whether it is preferable to adopt a single-till or dual-till approach to pricing aeronautical services. This thesis aims to analyse the potential loss of social welfare {{as a result of}} adopting the single-till approach and the dual-till approach under three airport pricing scenarios. A review of international experience of economic regulation of airports, as well as a qualitative discussion on {{the difference between the two}} approaches, has been undertaken. A mathematical model and a number of economic graphs have been constructed. The equations derived from the model show that the dual-till approach is desirable when aeronautical capacity is fully utilised or already over-utilised, while the single-till approach is preferable where there is excess capacity. London Heathrow Airport is taken as the subject of the case study. The results illustrate that the dual-till price was higher than the single-till price by 12 % in 2001102, while the market-clearing price was higher than the single-till price by 75 %. The differences between the two approaches are: (i) the potential loss of social welfare is less under the dual till than under the single till by 1. 64 % of aeronautical social welfare for the summer season, and 1. 34 % for the winter season; (ii) the excess demand is less by 3. 0 % of capacity; (iii) the average number of passengers per flight is increased by three; (iv) the profits for Heathrow Airport increase from £ 5. 38 to £ 6. 05 per passenger; and (v) the airlines' cost is higher by £ 0. 67 per passenger, and airfares will be increased by up to £ 0. 67. These estimates can be significantly affected by the level of average cost of aeronautical services (which is the dual-till price) and the airlines' valuation on slots (which influences the slope of the demand curve for aeronautical services) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: 1. 1 BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION Very few issues {{relating}} to the international air transportation industry are today as divisive as those pertaining to user charges imposed at international airports and enroute air navigation facilities. In recent years, this general subject has led to acrimonious arguments, heated confrontations and even legal proceedings involving airlines (and the entire airport user community), airport authorities and national and local governments. Moreover, the end is nowhere in sight: should the current economic difficulties {{of many of the}} world's international airlines persist [...] as well they might [...] it is possible that disputes related to user charges will intensify further and reach critical proportions at some future time. The general label 'user charges" comprises a variety of fees which are employed by providers of aeronautical facilities and services as a means of recovering (partially, fully, or more-than-fully) the costs that they incur. A listing of the various kinds of user charges in existence is given in Table 1. 1. Any given Airport Authority or organization that offers air navigation and aeronautical services may impose some or all of these charges. It is possible to state several facts that help explain why the subject of user charges is such a controversial one. At the same time, these facts provide the motivation for studies such as the one reported here: Fact 1 : User charges have gone through a period of rapid increases in absolute and, in many cases, relative terms as well, over the last decade. A confluence of factors have contributed to these increases. Perhaps the foremost among them is that, during the 1970 's, the aviation industry Table 1. 1 TYPES OF USER CHARGES AIRPORT CHARGES:- Aeronautical Charges: Landing and/or take-off charges, Parking and hangar charges, Passenger service charges, Security charges, Airport noise charges, Ground (ramp and traffic) handling charges, Concession fees for aviation fuel and oil, Rentals of air terminal space, premises and equipment, Non-Aeronautical Charges: Rentals of airport land, premises and equipment (for purposes other than servicing traffic), Concession fees for commercial concerns catering to the public, Fees derived from airport's own operation of shops and services, Fees charged for tours, admission to reserved areas, etc. ENROUTE CHARGES Air navigation charges * The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) recommends that where fuel charges are imposed, they should be recognized by airport authorities as being concession <b>charges</b> of an <b>aeronautical</b> nature and that fuel concessionaires should not add them automatically to the price of fuel to aircraft operator [ICAO, 1981 d]. began to be treated as a "mature" one, in most of the world. Until then, many countries were content to subsidize the industry through provision of aeronautical facilities and services at no cost or at much-below cost. (It is a remarkable fact, for instance, that no enroute air navigation charges were collected by someWest European nations until 1971, the year when Eurocontrol began collecting charges designed to recover only 15 % of costs.) However, as the industry grew "above critical size" and stabilized during the 1960 's and 1970 's, government attitudes toward it generally changed and a "users-pay" principle was increasingly being applied to the setting of user charges by the 1970 's. (By 1981, Eurocontrol was recovering 100 % of enroute air navigation costs on behalf of its 11 member states.) A second factor is that, during this period, some new types of charges, notably security charges and noise charges, have been added {{for the first time to}} the array of other charges that airlines traditionally faced. The fact that many aeronautical services are labor-intensive ones [...] notably ground handling, enroute and terminal-area air navigation and security [...] was a third contributing factor, as labor costs are particularly sensitive to inflationary pressures such as those experienced worldwide during the period in question. Yet another factor is that since the mid- 1960 's many countries have been investing large amounts of capital toward improving their aeronautical infrastructures (new or improved airports, modernization of ATC systems). As these new or improved facilities came into service, the cost-base on which user charges are computed grew rapidly. While one can expand this list of factors considerably, the point is that airlines and users of aviation facilities have felt the impact of such rapid increases. This, moreover, happened at a time when many of them were experiencing significant economic pressures. For example, IATA contends that, during the period of the dramatic fuel-price increases (1973 - 1981), the only other component of their costs that grew nearly as rapidly as fuel costs were <b>aeronautical</b> user <b>charges</b> (see Table 1. 2). Fact 2 : There are large differences from country to country and from location to location in the ways user charges are computed and in the magnitude of user charges. This is amply demonstrated by Table 1. 3, which shows the size of typical landing fees and passenger service charges in a number of selected countries for three important aircraft types. Similar or even larger differences exist in the magnitudes of other charges imposed (especially for ground handling and enroute air navigation services), as will be shown in many parts of this report. Such differences - coupled with the unfortunate tendency of many aeronautical authorities to provide inadequate or minimal documentation in explaining their user charges [...] have led to accusations of "unfairness", "predatory behavior", or "discrimination" against several specific countries or airports' (e. g., London/Heathrow, Tokyo/Narita, Australia). It is not surprising that such accusations are usually directed toward those that impose the highest charges. However, locations that impose much-lower charges, but have the benefit of a lower cost-base as well, are just as susceptible to adopting such practices. Fact 3 : In many cases, user charges may absorb a sizable fraction of an international commercial flight's gross revenues. This is illustrated in Tables 1. 4 and 1. 5 for the case of flights by a real, but anonymous, Airline X between its home base (XXX) and New York (JFK International), London/Heathrow and Amsterdam. Table 1. 4 shows all the charges imposed for each route/equipment combination for load factors of 100 %, 1 We do not imply here that such accusations are necessarily justified. Landing Fee at destination includes parking charge 4 -hour stay-over in NYC; 2 -hour in LON, AMS Peak-hour use in summer [...] . The specific assumptions made are listed at the bottom of Table 1. 4. Table 1. 5 estimates what percentage of total revenues (true one-way yields on the routes were provided by Airline X) is absorbed by user charges. (For example, for a B 747 flight to NYC at 100 % load factor, the total user charges of $ 18, 378 [...] see Table 1. 4 - amount to 5. 74 % of the round-trip revenues of $ 320, 000). It can be seen that user charges in these examples vary from 6 % to 22 % of gross revenues, depending on destination, aircraft involved and load factor. It is also important to note that the total user charges (last line of Table 1. 4) are largely determined by the type of aircraft flown on any given route and are quite insensitive to the load factor [...] a characteristic that is quite vexing to the airlines. While this example is given for illustrative purposes only, the range of percentages it indicates in Table 1. 5 is not atypical. IATA estimates that the sum of enroute charges and landing and other airport fees (not including ground handling charges and passenger service costs at airports) amount to approximately 6 % of the total (direct and indirect) costs of the international scheduled services of its members. West European airlines contend that these same charges amount to 11. 2 % of their total costs for intra-European services and an even-higher percentage for airlines specializing in short-haul routes. (cont.) The Association of European Airlines (AEA), in fact, often blames high user charges in Europe as one of the main reasons for the higher European operating costs and therefore higher fares per mile. 2 Most of the recent complaints of AEA carriers have centered in particular on enroute air navigation charges collected through the Eurocontrol agency. Pan Am has reported that whereas user charges of various kinds accounted for 4 % of its costs on international routes in 1970, they now account for 9 %. For domestic trunk carriers in the 2 This view is not necessarily endorsed here. United States, user fees account for 4. 2 % of their costs. However, this percentage does not include the 8 % tax on domestic fares, which is collected on behalf of the Aviation Trust Fund and which can be viewed as an <b>aeronautical</b> user <b>charge.</b> Up to a few years ago, U. S. airlines were among those most vocal in protesting the magnitude of and lack of uniformity in international user charges. Partially as a result, the International Air Transportation Fair Competitve Practices Act that became law in the United States on January 3, 1975 directs the Secretary of Transportation to survey foreign user charges and to report to the Secretary of State and the Civil Aeronautics Board any charges that unreasonably exceed comparable U. S. charges or are otherwise discriminatory. The latter are then to negotiate with the foreign country involved to reduce such charges or eliminate such discrimination [Pogue and Davison, 1979]. The Act also gives to the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the right to impose compensatory charges on foreign carriers, should such negotiations fail. It should be noted that, as a result of the rapid increase of the exchange value of the U. S. dollar during the 1981|$|R
