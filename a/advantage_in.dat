Field Marshal Model reported that only 6,500 replacements had been sent to cover the 75,000 casualties suffered during the month of September. General Eisenhower commanded three army groups, totaling eight field armies with 55 divisions; these provided a two-to-one <b>advantage</b> <b>in</b> artillery guns and a twenty-to-one <b>advantage</b> <b>in</b> tanks, and could count on almost 14,000 combat aircraft, as compared to the Luftwaffe's 573.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, {{before the}} {{outbreak}} of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics. In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and British Dominions) had a 30 per cent larger population and a 30 per cent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis powers (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, it then gives the Allies more than a 5:1 <b>advantage</b> <b>in</b> population and nearly 2:1 <b>advantage</b> <b>in</b> GDP. In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan, but only an 89 per cent higher GDP; this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 per cent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.|$|E
