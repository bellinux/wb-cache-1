A sample of RNA is separated on an agarose gel and hybridized to a radioactively labeled RNA probe that is complementary to the target sequence. The radiolabeled RNA is then detected by an <b>autoradiograph.</b> Because the use of radioactive reagents makes the procedure time consuming and potentially dangerous, alternative labeling and detection methods, such as digoxigenin and biotin chemistries, have been developed. Perceived disadvantages of Northern blotting are that large quantities of RNA are required and that quantification may not be completely accurate, as it involves measuring band strength in {{an image of a}} gel. On the other hand, the additional mRNA size information from the Northern blot allows the discrimination of alternately spliced transcripts.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{analysis}} of silver grain content in both single and double label <b>autoradiographs</b> is presented. The total grain area is calculated by counting the number of pixels at which the recorded light intensity in transmission dark field illumination exceeds a selected threshold. The calibration tests included <b>autoradiographs</b> with low (3 H- thymidin) and high (3 H-desoxyuridin) silver grain density. The results are proportional to the customary visual grain count. For the range of visibly countable grain densities in single labeled specimens, the correlation coefficient between the computed values and the visual grain counts is better than 0. 96. In the first emulsion of the two emulsion layer <b>autoradiographs</b> of double labeled specimens (3 H- 14 C- thymidin) the correlation coefficient is 0. 919 and 0. 906. The method provides a statistical correction for the background grains not due to the isotope. The possibility to record 14 C tracks by shifting the focus through the second emulsion of the double labeled specimens is also demonstrated. The reported technique is essentially independent of size, shape and density of the grains. ...|$|R

50|$|An <b>autoradiograph</b> is {{an image}} on an x-ray film or nuclear {{emulsion}} produced by the pattern of decay emissions (e.g., beta particles or gamma rays) from a distribution of a radioactive substance. Alternatively, the <b>autoradiograph</b> is also available as a digital image (digital autoradiography), due to the recent development of scintillation gas detectors or rare earth phosphorimaging systems. The film or emulsion is apposed to the labeled tissue section to obtain the <b>autoradiograph</b> (also called an autoradiogram). The auto- prefix indicates that the radioactive substance is within the sample, as distinguished from the case of historadiography or microradiography, in which the sample is X-rayed using an external source. Some autoradiographs can be examined microscopically for localization of silver grains (such as on the interiors or exteriors of cells or organelles) in which the process is termed micro-autoradiography. For example, micro-autoradiography {{was used to examine}} whether atrazine was being metabolized by the hornwort plant or by epiphytic microorganisms in the biofilm layer surrounding the plant.|$|E

This family of expected istributions was called the "univer-sal curves". In the present study, experiments on ~ 4 C-labeled specimens refine our information regarding the tails of the universal curves. When the expected grain distributions from 125 I-, all-, and ~ 4 C-sources were compared, significant differences were found depending on the energy of the isotope. These differences were primarily in the tails of the distributions, and are therefore important in correcting for cross-scatter when analyzing electron microscope <b>autoradiographs.</b> Using the universal curves unique for ~ I, 3 H, and 14 C, we designed three sets of transparent overlays, or "masks", one set for each of these isotopes.

50|$|Restriction {{landmark}} genomic scanning (RLGS) is a {{genome analysis}} method for rapid simultaneous visualization {{of thousands of}} landmarks, or restriction sites. Using a combination of restriction enzymes {{some of which are}} specific to DNA modifications, the technique can be used to visualize differences in methylation levels across the genome of a given organism. RLGS employs direct labeling of DNA, which is first cut by a specific series of restriction enzymes, and then labeled by a radioactive isotope (usually phosphorus-32). A two-dimensional electrophoresis process is then employed, yielding high-resolution results. The radioactive second-dimension gel is then allowed to expose a large sheet of film. The radiation produced by the radioactive labeling will cause the film to be exposed wherever the restriction fragments have migrated during electrophoresis. The film is then developed, yielding a visual representation of the results {{in the form of an}} <b>autoradiograph.</b> The same combination of restriction enzymes will produce the same pattern of 'spots' from samples from the same organisms, but different patterns for different types of organism. For example, human and mouse DNA will produce distinctly different patterns when treated with the same combination of enzymes. These finished auto-rads can be examined against each other, revealing any changes in gene expression that lead to visual differences in the film. Each <b>autoradiograph</b> contains thousands of spots, each corresponding to a labeled DNA restriction landmark.|$|E

The hybridization probe for primer extension is a synthesized oligonucleotide, whereas S1 mapping requires isolation of a DNA fragment. Both methods provide information where a mRNA starts and provide {{an estimate of the}} concentration of a transcript by the intensity of the transcript band on the resulting <b>autoradiograph.</b> Unlike S1 mapping, however, primer extension can only be used to locate the 5’-end of an mRNA transcript because the DNA synthesis required for the assay relies on reverse transcriptase (only polymerizes in the 5’ → 3’ direction).|$|E

In <b>autoradiographs</b> of tubes longer than 1 mm, a small fraction of cells show a distinctly larger 45 Ca accumulation, the tip containing more than 100 times that {{in the rest of the}} cell. The 1 - to 5 -h labeling experiments show that calcium is relatively concentrated within the cytoplasm of the growing tip. The 1 - to 3 -min labeling experiments suggest that calcium may enter the tip faster than it enters other regions.

To determine the cell type(s) responsible for the increased RNA synthesis, we compared light <b>autoradiographs</b> of control and hypertrophying muscles from rats injected with tritiated uridine 12, 24, and 48 h after inducing hypertrophy. There was an increased number of silver grains over <b>autoradiographs</b> of hypertrophied muscle. This increase occurred over connective tissue cells; there was no {{increase in the number}} of silver grains over the muscle fibers. Quantitative studies demonstrated that between 70 and 80 % of the radioactivity in the muscle that survived fixation and washing was in RNA. Pretreatment of the animals with actinomycin D reduced in parallel both the radioactivity in RNA and the number of silver grains over <b>autoradiographs.</b> Proliferation of the connective tissue in hypertrophying muscle was evident in light micrographs, and electron micrographs identified the proliferating cells as enlarged fibroblasts and macrophages; the connective tissue cells remained after hypertrophy was completed. Thus, proliferating connective tissue cells are the major site of the increase in new RNA synthesis during acute work-induced growth of skeletal muscle.

With longer incubations nucleoli from oocytes of o- 6 to r i mm dia-meter become more uniformly labelled. Those of oocytes larger than i- 2 mm diameter remain asymmetrically labelled whatever the incubation time. <b>Autoradiographs</b> of i-/t sections through oocytes larger than o- 6 mm diameter show, after short incubations, asymmetrically labelled nucleoli. In these <b>autoradiographs</b> silver grains are concentrated over a distinct component of each nucleolus which is eccentrically placed towards the nuclear envelope. Thin sections of oocytes show nucleoli consisting of core and cortex. The core material is always concentrated into the half of the nucleolus which, lies nearer the nuclear envelope. <b>Autoradiographs</b> of separated nucleolar cores and cortices from oocytes larger than o- 6 mm diameter show, after short incubations, silver grains over cores but not over cortices. Similar <b>autoradiographs</b> prepared from oocytes of o- 6 to r i mm diameter, after longer incubations, show grains over cores and cortices. These results appear to indicate that nucleolar RNA is synthesized in the nucleolar core, in association with the nucleolar DNA, and is thence transferred to the cortex where it is built into ribonucleoprotein particles. Initial asymmetrical labelling is a consequence of the eccentric location of the nucleolar core. The nucleoli of oocytes smaller than o- 6 mm diameter always label symmetrically; such nucleoli consist entirely of core material. It is suggested that the nucleoli of oocytes larger than 1 - 2 mm diameter always label asymmetrically because transfer of RNA from core to cortex proceeds more slowly than in smaller oocytes...|$|R
