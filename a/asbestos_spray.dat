50|$|In 1975 an inquest {{into the}} death of former railway work Frank Summers {{recorded}} that he had died from an industrial disease; he had previous been employed in <b>asbestos</b> <b>spraying</b> at York Carriage works. At the inquest it was claimed {{that the use of}} asbestos at the works ended in 1964; initially the dangers of asbestos were not known and employees worked without facemasks or other protection; workers continued to be exposed to asbestos into the 1970s, relatives of workers also developed asbestos related diseases through contact with dust on workers clothing.|$|R
25|$|Numerous baths were modernised {{with the}} {{installation}} of new lighting which {{was added to the}} roof and inside the pool itself. Acoustic treatment was added and in some cases, <b>asbestos</b> was <b>sprayed</b> in the buildings.|$|R
25|$|The baths were {{improved}} {{again in}} 1948 with {{the installation of}} underwater lighting, improved lighting in the bath hall {{and the application of}} <b>sprayed</b> <b>asbestos</b> acoustic treatment to the bath hall ceiling.|$|R
50|$|They {{introduced}} {{some new}} features; the first standard multiple units with disc brakes (emergency stop from top speed in 33 seconds over 800 yd); the first naturally air-cooled rectifiers (silicon diodes on cups of beryllium oxide), inductors and transformers. Noise was reduced by <b>sprayed</b> <b>asbestos</b> on the floor, body and roof.|$|R
5000|$|On September 14, 2001, {{three days}} after {{terrorist}} attacks destroyed the World Trade Center, Milloy wrote that the World Trade Center towers might have stood longer, preventing many casualties, had the use of asbestos fire-resistant lagging not been discontinued during the Towers' construction. [...] Milloy's article reported that, [...] "In 1971, New York City banned the use of <b>asbestos</b> in <b>spray</b> fireproofing. At that time, asbestos insulating material had only been sprayed up to the 64th floor of the World Trade Center towers," [...] and cited an expert who questioned {{the efficacy of the}} asbestos-free lagging that was used on the steel in the upper floors.|$|R
40|$|Dumps are {{potential}} emittents for very different particulates. The atmospheric environment of dumps can be also contaminated by release of carcinogenic <b>asbestos</b> fibers, because <b>sprayed</b> <b>asbestos,</b> asbestos cement refuse from sanitation and demolition of buildings is very often storaged here. Ambient air concentrations of asbestos fibers {{as high as}} 10. 000 to 40. 000 fibers (longer than 5 mym) /cubic meter were measured on three garbage dumps and building refuse dumps during our investigations. The concentrations of other mineral fibers in ambient air of these garbage dumps were high too; up to 30. 000 fibers (longer than 5 mym) /cubic meter. Also ambient air {{in the vicinity of}} such dumps is contaminated by asbestos fibers at a level of about 1000 fibers asbestos fibers (longer than 5 mym) /cubic meter. These concentrations can be reached especially during inversion situations and low wind velocities. For ambient air asbestos fiber concentrations of 1000 fibers (longer than 5 mym) /cbm the healt h risk for the general population could be estimated as high as of about 10 E- 4 (one more carcinogenic case for 10. 000 inhabitants). The other ambient air carcinogens increase by their synergistic effect to this value too. Control methods for sanitation of dumps containing asbestos wastes have to be developed and their efficiency has to be proved by measuring asbestos fiber emission and ambient air concentrations.

50|$|The British Rail Class 109 is a {{class of}} 2-car diesel {{multiple}} units built in 1957 by D Wickham & Co. Five two-car units were built featuring an unusual body design. The design, first used in 1936 for South American railways, aimed to minimise weight. It had no underframe, but the whole body was formed into a welded stress-bearing box girder made of 1/8 in solid drawn steel tube. Aluminium was used for panels, luggage racks, window frames, vacuum pipes and fuel and vacuum tanks. The corrugated steel floor was filled with <b>sprayed</b> <b>asbestos</b> and covered with asbestos-filled flame-proofed hardboard and rubber sheet.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 38 - 44) A modern sixteen-story {{office building}} was surveyed {{to determine if}} erosion of <b>spray</b> <b>asbestos</b> fibres from the cementitious surface of the air plenum chambers was contaminating the building air supply system, subjecting the occupants to a potential hazard. The NIOSH approved method of collection and analysis was utilized. This consisted of collecting the fibres on a membrane filter, dissolving the filter on a glass slide, and then counting the fibres utilizing phase microscopy. Fibre concentrations {{were found to be}} extremely low and most probably reflect the general ambient level in the urban environment, as two nearby buildings that did not incorporate asbestos-based building materials had comparable levels. These extremely low levels {{do not appear to be}} biologically significant...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{workers are}} at an {{increased}} risk of developing chronic respiratory disorders. Accurate estimation of long-term agricultural exposures based on questionnaires has been used to improve the validity of epidemiologic investigations and subsequent evaluation of the association between agricultural exposures and chronic diseases. Our aim was to use principal factor analysis (PFA) to distill exposure data into essential variables characterizing long-term agricultural exposures. This is a crosssectional study of veterans between the ages of 40 and 80 years and who worked on a farm for ≥ 2 years. Participant characteristics were: 98. 1 % were white males with a mean age 65 ± 8 (SD) years and 39. 8 % had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The final model included four factors and explained 16. 6 % {{of the variance in the}} exposure data. Factor 1 was a heterogeneous factor; however, Factor 2 was exclusively composed of exposure to livestock such as hogs, dairy and poultry. Factor 3 included exposures from jobs on or off the farm such as wood dust, mineral dust, <b>asbestos</b> and <b>spray</b> paint. Crop exposure loaded exclusively in Factor 4 and included lifetime hours of exposure and maximum number of acres farmed in the participants’ lifetime. The factors in the final model were interpretable and consistent with farming practices...|$|R
50|$|Today {{spray-applied}} fireproofing materials use vermiculite, {{other industrial}} minerals, and expanded polystyrene, {{depending upon the}} exact commercial product. The ingredients for these products all have to meet stringent regulatory requirements, particularly in the US and Europe. In the past, vermiculite from the WR Grace mines in Montana, {{have been associated with}} <b>asbestos.</b> Therefore, old <b>spray</b> applied fire proofing, pre 1991, may contain small quantities of asbestos. In August 2014, the NYSDoH qualified two, more exact, test methods, better designed to identify materials with this potential problem, and assist in safely dealing with any issues associated with its removal. Modern spray applied fireproofing today is made with vermiculite that does not contain asbestos and is carefully monitored at all stages of mining and production to ensure this is the case.|$|R
40|$|A vendor was {{selected}} for the diamond wire technology demonstration scheduled for this summer at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL). A team consisting of personnel from FIU-HCET, PPPL, and AEA Technology reviewed the submitted bids. FIU-HCET will contract this vendor. At the SRS Ninth ICT teleconference, the ICT team discussed {{the status of the}} following demonstrations: LRAD; x-ray, K-edge; Strippable Coatings; Thermal Spray Vitrification; Cutting/Shearing/Dismantlement/Size Reduction; and Electrets. The LRAD demo is complete, and the x-ray/K-edge, Strippable Coatings, and Electrets demos are ongoing. The <b>Asbestos</b> and Thermal <b>Spray</b> Vitrification demos require more laboratory testing. The Cutting/Shearing/Dismantlement/Size Reduction demo is undergoing procurement. Five FIU-HCET staff members took the 1 S 0 14000 environmental auditor training course February 22 - 26, 1999, given by ASC. The test plan for the Facility Dismantlement Technology Assessment is finished and ready for internal review...|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{asbestos}} waste such as <b>asbestos</b> cement board, <b>sprayed</b> crocidolite and sprayed amosite was heated in a vacuum. The detoxification conditions were then established {{in reference to}} JIS A 1481 : 2006 and JIS K 3850 - 1 : 2006. When asbestos cement board was heated at 700 ℃ for 1 h, detoxification of the cement board was completed. On the other hand, {{in the case of}} amphibolic {{asbestos waste}}, such as sprayed crocidolite and sprayed amosite, was heated, a phase-contrast microscope analysis was not applicable for identification of asbestos heated at more than 500 ℃. According to XRD analysis, crocidolite was eliminated by heating at 800 ℃ for 3 h. Furthermore, amosite was not detected after heating at 700 ℃ for 3 h. Finally, the grindability of heated amphibolic asbestos was investigated. When sprayed crocidolite was heated at 900 ℃ for 3 h and then ground with a mortar for 300 s, the crushed grains had a length of less than 5 μm and an aspect ratio of 3. In addition, when sprayed amosite was heated at 1000 ℃ for 3 h and then ground, the crushed grains had a length of less than 5 μm and an aspect ratio of 3...|$|R
