500|$|As I Lay Dying {{realized}} {{it needed to}} expand to a five-piece band to include another guitarist and a bass guitarist. Mancino commented [...] "we started going on tour <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> obviously more people than that." [...] As Lambesis and Mancino were the only permanent members, the band recruited friends to perform with them and subsequently underwent several lineup changes: bass guitarist Noah Chase departed in 2001, while Brandon Hays, and his subsequent replacement Aaron Kennedy, departed in 2003. During early 2003, when As I Lay Dying's Pluto Records contract expired, the band pursued deals with other record labels. After extensive touring {{and an increase in}} popularity, As I Lay Dying was offered a record deal with Metal Blade Records in March 2003.|$|E
500|$|... "Twist and Shout" [...] charted again, 16 {{years after}} the Beatles broke up, {{as a result of}} its {{prominent}} appearance in both this film and Back To School (where Rodney Dangerfield performs a cover version) which was released the same weekend as Ferris Bueller's Day Off. The re-released single reached #23 in the U.S; a US-only compilation album containing the track The Early Beatles, re-entered the album charts at #197. The version heard in the film includes brass overdubbed onto the Beatles' original recording, which did not go down well with Paul McCartney. [...] "I liked [...] film but they overdubbed some lousy brass on the stuff! If it had needed brass, we'd had stuck it on ourselves!" [...] Upon hearing McCartney's reaction, Hughes felt bad for [...] "offend a Beatle. But it wasn't really part of the song. We saw a band [...] <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> to hear the instruments." ...|$|E
500|$|Voorhis's campaign, {{described}} by Bullock as [...] "traditionally amateurish and poorly put together", {{was slow to}} perceive the threat presented by Nixon and remained continually on the defensive. [...] In 1971, in an article marking the 25th anniversary of the campaign, Voorhis acknowledged that [...] "I never had much of an organization; frankly, there was no form to it. [...] <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> it badly in 1946." [...] In the same article, the Los Angeles Times described Voorhis's campaign as [...] "undermanned, underfinanced, outgunned, outmaneuvered and he apparently was {{on the wrong side}} of most of the issues of the day". [...] His one avenue of outreach in the press was his newspaper column, People's Business, which ran in most local newspapers. In July 1946, Voorhis chose to suspend this column lest it be thought that he was using it as a means of campaigning. According to Gellman, this weakened Voorhis's political outreach.|$|E

500|$|Anthony Mackie {{said the}} Russo {{brothers}} relied on minimal use of computer-generated imagery, stating, [...] "The Russos, {{what they did}} that was so great was, they wanted to stay with live action, which is a dying art form. If they can build it, they built it. If we could do it, we did it. They wanted to do as little CGI as possible. That's why the movie looks so great." [...] Nevertheless, six special effects companies are involved in creating the visual effects of the film, including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Scanline VFX, Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Whiskytree and The Embassy, with previsualization completed by Proof. The film contained 2,500 visual effects shots, with 900 worked on by ILM. The film featured extensive use of digital doubles. Russell Earl, ILM visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "The character that we did the most work on was Falcon. We {{knew we were going}} to do CG wings. We also did some shots with wires and some with stunt doubles and head replacement. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> a very good digital double." ...|$|E
500|$|Vince Gilligan, {{the writer}} of the episode, wanted Bryan Cranston to play the {{antagonist}} because he felt he would humanize the role. “We needed a guy who could be scary and kind of loathsome {{but at the same}} time had a deep, resounding humanity," [...] he later said. [...] In an interview with The New York Times, Gilligan stated, [...] "We had this villain, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> the audience to feel bad for him when he died. Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick. I have no idea how he does it.” Rick Millikan, the casting director for The X-Files noted that Cranston was nearly not chosen for this episode. Initially, the part of Crump had been assigned to a different actor, but Cranston came prepared to audition for the part. Although the character had already been cast, Millikan allowed him to audition and was very pleased with his performance and chose him for the part instead.|$|E

[...] When Tom Wilson heard the latter, {{he realized that}} The Mothers were not merely a blues band. In The Real Frank Zappa Book, Zappa wrote [...] "I {{could see through the}} window that he was scrambling toward the phone to call his boss—probably saying: 'Well, uh, not exactly a [...] "white blues band", but... sort of.'" [...] In a 1968 article written for Hit Parader magazine, Zappa wrote that when Wilson heard these songs, [...] "he was so impressed he got on the phone and called New York, and as a result I got a more or less unlimited budget to do this monstrosity." [...] Freak Out! is an early example of the concept album, a sardonic farce about rock music and America. [...] "All the songs on it were about something", Zappa wrote in The Real Frank Zappa Book. [...] "It wasn't as if we had a hit single <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> to build some filler around it. Each tune had a function within an overall satirical concept." ...|$|E

You don't mess with {{the forces of nature}} without getting bitten, {{and the fact that he}} literally saved everyone on the ship by that crystal not shattering was a wonderful, heroic thing and showed you that at heart, Coulson is a heroic man whose actions back up his words." [...] Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: [...] "When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... we prefer to leave you with something to talk about, to walk away with. This is something that came up in the room, we talked about what it meant ... The idea of getting Fitz and Simmons—who had been one person—to become two whole people, come back together, agree to go on a date, and then have this happen, felt beautifully poetic".|$|E
500|$|In what {{proved to}} be one of the {{tightest}} ever pitching duels in a perfect game, Joss took the mound for the Naps, while the White Sox pitcher was future Hall of Famer Ed Walsh. Neither pitcher would give up an earned run in the 1–0 game. Walsh, blistering through his own 39 win season, struck out 15 batters, gave up only one base on balls and allowed only four scattered hits by the Naps. The Naps' Joe Birmingham scored the team's only run, which came in the third inningthe lone, unearned run scored as a result of a botched pickoff play and a wild pitch. The tension in the ballpark was described by one writer as [...] "a mouse working his way along the grandstand floor would have sounded like a shovel scraping over concrete." [...] Joss, having faced the minimum 24 batters in the first eight inning, retired the first two batters in the bottom of the ninth. [...] Joss then faced White Sox pinch hitter John Anderson. Anderson hit a line drive that could have resulted in a double had it not gone foul. He then hit a ball to Naps third baseman Bill Bradley, which Bradley bobbled before throwing to first baseman George Stovall. Stovall dug the ball out of the dirt to achieve the final out. With the win, Joss recorded the second ever perfect game in MLB's modern era. He accomplished the feat with just 74 pitches, the lowest known pitch count ever achieved in a perfect game. Fans swarmed the field. After the game, Joss said, [...] "I never could have done it without Larry Lajoie's and Stovall's fielding and without Birmingham's base running. Walsh was marvelous with his splitter, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> two lucky strikes to win." ...|$|E

"Fly" [...] was {{produced}} {{as a result}} of the series' considerable budgetary restrictions and being unable to afford the $25,000–$35,000 needed to move the production trucks to a new location.

[...] The episode was written by Sam Catlin and Moira Walley-Beckett, and directed by Rian Johnson; it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on May 23, 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Fallout {{from this}} {{incident}} {{was compounded by}} allegations made by Senator Cristina Fernández de Kirchner that SIDE personnel were spying on her husband, Santa Cruz Governor Néstor Kirchner, who had recently declared his intention to run for President the following year. These controversies, and Soria's own plans to run for Governor of the Province of Río Negro, prompted his resignation from SIDE in July. He was narrowly defeated in provincial elections in August 2003 by UCR candidate Miguel Saiz, though in elections held later in 2003, Soria narrowly won the election for mayor {{of the city of}} General Roca (the largest in the province). Duhalde and Soria continued to face charges in court related to the 2002 deaths. Soria declared at trial in 2005 that [...] "democracy works with order, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> to establish order"; both men were cleared of all charges.|$|E
2500|$|After {{dealing with}} the tragedy {{surrounding}} Cheng's accident, Deftones wanted to create an album with an overall positive and optimistic vibe. Describing the band's state while writing for the album, Moreno stated, [...] "Our inspiration and unity as a band is stronger {{than it has ever}} been before <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> to channel that energy into our music". Noticeably lacking on the album were songs about complaining, hurting or how [...] "life sucks"– common lyrical themes for Moreno since the early '90s. Moreno described the overall theme of the album as a [...] "positive zest for life", and also said it had [...] "a fantasy vibe" [...] similar to White Pony. The lyrics for [...] "Rocket Skates" [...] contained [...] "beautiful yet violent imagery" [...] and were compared to the song [...] "Knife Prty" [...] from White Pony. Deftones also thought {{it would be difficult to}} tour in support of a new album with memories of Cheng attached to it. Commenting on songwriting, Moreno stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 1, 2011 Jakob Dylan {{announced}} that the Wallflowers would be reuniting to release an album, explaining: [...] "I never suggested we were breaking up.

[...] And that year break becomes two years, then becomes three years, {{and before you know}} it five or six years go by pretty quickly. [...] I can't do what I do in the Wallflowers without them. [...] I miss it." [...] In an interview with the St. Joseph News-Press, Dylan stated that the Wallflowers would be getting into the studio in January and the lineup would include Greg Richling on bass, Rami Jaffee on keys, Stuart Mathis on guitar and Fred Eltringham on drums. [...] However, weeks before the Wallflowers began recording, Eltringham left the band to pursue other projects. [...] The band quickly got former Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam drummer Jack Irons to join the band. [...] Irons was previously involved in a side project with Wallflowers bassist Richling.|$|E

As I was in -- in that 48-hour time period read the grand jury presentment, I reached the conclusion that given what had become public about the issues leading up to the presentment and given what was {{said in the}} presentment itself about Coach Paterno's testimony and about what the graduate student said to Coach Paterno, I felt that it would not send the right message if Coach Paterno was able to lead the football team out onto the field of play under those circumstances. So I didn't change my mind {{on the question of whether}} we had established all the key facts that related to Coach Paterno's involvement and/or responsibility. But I had reached the conclusion that, from the standpoint of what the University's values would be interpreted to be by the broader public, that what was known was sufficiently serious as it relates to child sexual abuse that it would send the wrong message about our values as a University if Coach Paterno were allowed to coach as though none of this had ever happened." ...|$|E
