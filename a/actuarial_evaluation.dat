40|$|In this paper, {{the use of}} life {{contingencies}} {{to establish}} reserves for claimants requiring ltfetime medical care is explored. In evaluating such claims, consideration {{should be given to}} the effects of inflation, dis-counting for interest, life expectancy, the impact of the claimant’s med-ical condition on ltfe expectancy, and the accurate measurement of medical costs. The evaluation is made in three phases: a claim evalua-tion, a medical evaluation, and an <b>actuarial</b> <b>evaluation.</b> The claim evaluation consists of gathering accurate information about the claimant’s medical condition and the current cost of providing medical care. The medical evaluation consists of using the medical information obtained from the claim evaluation to estimate the effect on the claimant’s life span. information obtained from the claim and med-ical evaluations is combined with assumptions regarding interest, injla-tion, and mortality to produce the <b>actuarial</b> <b>evaluation.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|Almost {{a decade}} after the reforms that {{partially}} pre-funded the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), the Plan is evolving much as their designers had hoped. Among the many features of the package negotiated in 1996 / 97 and implemented in 1998, the most critical was a ramping up of contribution rates faster than would have occurred under the old pay-as-you-go structure. Income from the resulting provident fund was intended to prevent contribution rates from continuing to rise as the aging baby-boom generation drove up the ratio of pensioners to contributors, instead containing rates at 9. 9 percent. This change, and parallel changes to the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP), {{played a key role in}} the restoration of Canada’s fiscal health after the mid- 1990 s. The ratio of the CPP’s unfunded liability to GDP declined with the reforms, and currently looks likely to hold steady at around 40 percent for the next decade (Figure 1). The CPP’s last <b>actuarial</b> <b>evaluation</b> as at year-end 2003 (OCA 2004) showed that the 9. 9 percent contribution rate should be sustainable through the lifetimes of current plan participants. ...|$|E

40|$|Although the Icelandic general {{labour market}} pension funds {{are built on}} the proviso that pension schemes are fully funded these funds are still {{grappling}} with the devastating financial effects of the 2008 economic collapse that rendered {{most of them in}} a significant actuarial deficit. The public sector pension funds are based on an employer guarantee that makes up for any lack of funding that historically has been quite significant. We identify the relatively high actuarial discount rate and increasing longevity as two factors that add to the vulnerability of the Icelandic pension system. We present a stochastic model in order to obtain reasonably sound estimates of the effect of revising such key parameters of the actuarial assessments of the pension funds and thus obtain a view of the viability of the Icelandic pension system when confronted with the potential necessity of such parameter shifts. We present results of stochastic simulations of this models made to assess effects of changes in these major financial and demographic assumptions in <b>actuarial</b> <b>evaluations</b> of pension fund balances. Our results suggest that the Icelandic pension funds may be significantly less well funded than is generally perceived...|$|R
40|$|Most {{replication}} {{studies of}} actuarial risk scales for sex offenders focus on relative predictive accuracy (e. g., ROC), with little {{attention paid to}} the stability of absolute recidivism estimates. Research has identified several factors external to actuarial scales that may affect recidivism rates (e. g., recidivism definition, age, dynamic risk factors, treatment, country, setting). Raw data from 29 Static- 99 replication studies were combined (n = 9, 261). Recidivism base rates per Static- 99 score were significantly and meaningfully lower in more recent samples compared to the original norms, necessitating new norms. Although Static- 99 provided consistent estimates of relative risk, base rates varied across samples. Two variables strongly influenced the base rates: age at release and sample type (defined by the preselection in the samples). A revised version of Static- 99 with new age weights was developed (Static- 99 R), {{and the implications of}} base rate variability for <b>actuarial</b> <b>evaluations</b> are discussed.

40|$|The aim of our {{contribution}} {{is to develop}} a technique for rebalancing pension fund portfolios in function of their pointwise level of risk. It has been debated that post retirement benefit plans should have limitations on their asset allocation, based on the risk profile of the different financial instruments available on the financial market. The performance of pension funds is usually measured in terms of returns rather than risk. Risks are taken into account especially during market crises, when losses in the portfolio of financial instruments of the fund could lead to depreciations in the accrued contributions. Some analysises (see Ryan and Fabozzi 2003) show that post 2001 bankruptcies of US pension funds had their roots in the <b>actuarial</b> <b>evaluation</b> techniques rather than in asset losses, if we consider long-term stock return. According to Bader (2003) and McClurken (2006), post retirement benefit plans, pertaining to the ‘first pillar ’ of a pension system, should not invest in high-risk financial instruments because this would lead to problems related to moral hazard and to the evaluation of ‘superfluous risk’. Trudda (2005) proposes an application to the pension funds of Italia...|$|E
