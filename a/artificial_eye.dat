25|$|The {{motility}} of a nonintegrated <b>artiﬁcial</b> <b>eye</b> may {{be caused}} by at least two forces. (1) The rubbing force between the posterior surface of the <b>artiﬁcial</b> <b>eye</b> and the conjunctiva that covers the implant may cause the <b>artiﬁcial</b> <b>eye</b> to move. Because this force is likely to be approximately equal in all directions, it would cause comparable horizontal and vertical <b>artiﬁcial</b> <b>eye</b> amplitudes. (2) An <b>artiﬁcial</b> <b>eye</b> usually ﬁts snugly in the conjunctival space (possibly not in the superior fornix). Therefore, any movement of the conjunctival fornices will cause a similar movement of the <b>artiﬁcial</b> <b>eye,</b> whereas lack of movement of the fornices will restrict its motility.|$|E

25|$|In {{hydroxyapatite}} implants {{a secondary}} procedure can insert an externalized, round-headed peg or screw into the implant. The prosthesis {{is modified to}} accommodate the peg, creating a ball-and-socket joint: after fibrovascular ingrowth is completed, a small hole can be drilled into the anterior surface of the implant. After conjunctivalization of this hole, it can be fitted with a peg with a rounded top that ﬁts into a corresponding dimple at the posterior surface of the <b>artiﬁcial</b> <b>eye.</b> This peg thus directly transfers implant motility to the <b>artiﬁcial</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT:This paper {{studies the}} {{fabrication}} of curved surface <b>artificial</b> compound <b>eyes</b> and application in the optical imaging system. At present, the planar <b>artificial</b> compound <b>eyes</b> imaging system has narrow {{field of view}} angle because of its flat array structure of compound eyes. The preparation process of some existed curved surface <b>artificial</b> compound <b>eyes</b> is very complex and {{is very difficult to}} guarantee their exact curvature of the substrate. This paper presents a new method to fabricate the curved <b>artificial</b> compound <b>eyes</b> precisely based on MEMS technology The base diameter of the compound eye lens surface is 8 mm and the height is 3 mm, which includes thousands of compound eyelet. The diameter of the eyelet is 170 µm, and the height is 18 µm. We use this curved <b>artificial</b> compound <b>eyes</b> and CCD imaging sensor assembly,aside from the impact of edge effects,we get the multi-angle and multi-dimensional photography to one object {{in the center of the}} imaging area. Therefore, the curved <b>artificial</b> compound <b>eyes</b> optical imaging system has a strong advantage in the dynamic spatial orientation. 1...|$|R
25|$|Despite the {{reasoning}} stating that hydroxyapatite orbital implants without a motility peg would yield a superior <b>artiﬁcial</b> <b>eye</b> motility, when similar surgical techniques are used unpegged porous (hydroxyapatite) enucleation implants and donor sclera-covered nonporous (acrylic) spherical enucleation implants yield comparable <b>artiﬁcial</b> <b>eye</b> motility. In two studies {{there were no}} differences in maximum amplitude between hydroxyapatite and acrylic or silicone spherical enucleation implants, thus indicating that the implant material itself may not have a bearing on implant movement as long as the muscles are attached directly or indirectly to the implant and the implant is not pegged.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{motility}} peg {{is mounted}} {{in only a}} minority of patients. This may partially be the result of problems associated with peg placement, whereas hydroxyapatite implants are assumed to yield superior <b>artiﬁcial</b> <b>eye</b> motility even without the peg.|$|E

40|$|Many ophthalmologists find it {{difficult}} to distinguish between small retinal hemorrhages and dust artifacts when using fundus photography for the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. Six patients with diabetic retinopathy underwent fundus photography, which revealed dust artifacts in the photographs of some patients. We constructed an experimental device similar to the optical system of the fundus camera and colored the fundi of the <b>artificial</b> <b>eyes</b> with khaki, sunset, rose and sunflower colors. Using the experimental device, we photographed dust artifacts using each <b>artificial</b> <b>eyes.</b> We used Scilab 5. 4. 0 and SIVP 0. 5. 3 softwares to convert the red, green, and blue (RGB) color space to the hue, saturation, and value (HSV) color space. We calculated the differences between the areas of manifestations and perimanifestations and the areas of dust artifacts and periartifacts using average HSVs. The V values in HSV for the manifestations were as follows: hemorrhages, 0. 06 ± 0. 03; hard exudates, − 0. 12 ± 0. 06; and photocoagulation marks, 0. 07 ± 0. 02. For dust artifacts, visualized in the human and <b>artificial</b> <b>eyes,</b> the V values were as follows: human eye, 0. 19 ± 0. 03; khaki, 0. 41 ± 0. 02; sunset, 0. 43 ± 0. 04; rose, 0. 47 ± 0. 11; and sunflower, 0. 59 ± 0. 07.

25|$|Though {{there is}} {{evidence}} that ocular implants have been around for thousands of years modern nonintegrated spherical intraconal implants came into existence around 1976 (not just glass eyes). Nonintegrated implants contain no unique apparatus for attachments to the extraocular muscles and do not allow in-growth of organic tissue into their inorganic substance. Such implants have no direct attachment to the ocular prosthesis. Usually, these implants are covered with a material that permits ﬁxation of the extraocular recti muscles, such as donor sclera or polyester gauze which improves implant motility, but does not allow for direct mechanical coupling between the implant and the <b>artiﬁcial</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E

500|$|During {{the first}} work by Shinichirō Watanabe on Cowboy Bebop, the first image {{that came to}} him was of Spike. Prior to that, Watanabe had the {{character}} of Spike in mind {{for a long time}} beforehand. From that point on, Watanabe [...] "tried to build a story around him, trying to make him cool." [...] Watanabe created Spike as a mirror image of himself: in Watanabe's words, [...] "I don't smoke or drink or fight, but I want to – so Spike does." [...] Spike forms the main focus on the series, with the central theme being his past and its karmic effect on him. Spike was portrayed as a [...] "typical old-style Japanese man", who would simply do what he wanted and expect others to follow his lead and watch him from the sidelines. Spike's <b>artificial</b> <b>eye</b> was included as Watanabe wanted his characters to have flaws. He was originally going to give Spike an eye patch, but the producers vetoed it. In order to portray him as cool, Toshihiro Kawamoto designed Spike to look [...] "uncool": when he stands still, he has a hunched appearance. This meant that when the character was moving vigorously, he came across as [...] "extra cool". Spike's appearance was primarily based on the main protagonist of Tantei Monogatari, portrayed by famous Japanese actor Yusaku Matsuda. Although Yamadera was a fan of Matsuda's, he avoided imitating his distinctive manner of speaking, noting that it [...] "wouldn't have sounded right" [...] for Spike. Spike's Swordfish II spaceship was created by mecha designer Kimitoshi Yamane. Yamane liked the English biplane torpedo-bomber Fairey Swordfish, which led him to name the Swordfish II after the bomber. The conclusion of Spike's story and his final battle with Vicious were planned by Watanabe well in advance, with each episode featuring them meant to shadow their final confrontation. Some of the staff were unhappy about this approach as a continuation of the series would be difficult. While he considered altering the ending, he eventually settled with his original idea.|$|E

Likert responses were 1. 84 ± 0. 37 for using live greyhounds and 0. 58 ± 0. 79 for using simulator eyes (p< 0. 0001). Thematic analysis of the written responses showed that while the <b>artificial</b> <b>eyes</b> were considered somewhat valuable in initial training, the live dogs were significantly preferred for their realism and the opportunity to examine the eye while handling a live animal. In conclusion, while model eyes are valuable initial training in use of the ophthalmoscope for funduscopic examination, students consider that examining the eye in the live dog is significantly more valuable and that the welfare of dogs thus used is not in their view unduly compromised...|$|R

40|$|Abstract.

In this <b>artificial</b> compound <b>eye,</b> each of the micro-lens has an aspheric surface instead of spherical surface, {{which leads to a}} reduction of spherical aberration from 400 µm to 75 µm. The focal length of micro-lens is decided by its own position and equals to the distance between base surface and image receiver. The sructural parameters of micro-lens were calculated according to the theory of geometrical optics. The model of <b>artificial</b> compound <b>eye</b> was built and verified by ray tracing.
