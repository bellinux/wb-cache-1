5|$|Today, {{the blue}} whale is renowned {{for being the}} largest animal ever to have lived. In part because of its legendary status, many misconceptions still exist. For example, its size is often exaggerated. Many popular sources give the maximum length as 110 feet (33.5 meters) or more. While such lengths were {{reported}} in the whaling records, they were not scientifically verified and were probably exaggerated. Virtually all books and articles that mention the blue whale claim that it can reach 100 feet (30.5 meters). This is probably true (the largest verified specimen was 29.9 meters, 98 feet) but is highly misleading <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> size is much smaller.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} rank players, FIDE, ICCF, and {{national}} chess organizations use the Elo rating system developed by Arpad Elo. Elo is a statistical {{system based on}} the assumption that the chess performance of each player in his or her games is a random variable. Arpad Elo thought of a player's true skill <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> of that player's performance random variable, and showed how to estimate the average from results of player's games. The US Chess Federation implemented Elo's suggestions in 1960, and the system quickly gained recognition as being both fairer and more accurate than older systems; it was adopted by FIDE in 1970. The highest FIDE rating of all time, 2881, was achieved by Magnus Carlsen on the March 2014 FIDE rating list.|$|E
5|$|The new Ibrox had a {{capacity}} of 44,000 and was opened with an Old Firm game played on 19 September 1981.

The redeveloped stadium was partly blamed for this, as some fans felt that the new ground lacked atmosphere due to the spaces between the stands. This was during a period of low attendances in Scottish football in general. Despite the relatively low attendance at Ibrox, Rangers had the highest average home attendances in the Premier Division in both 1983–84 and 1984–85.|$|E
