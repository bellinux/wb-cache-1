Because the {{angle to the}} transponder is measured, a correction {{needs to be made}} for the ship's roll and pitch. These are determined by Motion Reference Units. Because of the nature of <b>angle</b> <b>measurement,</b> the accuracy deteriorates with increasing water depth.|$|E
25|$|Long base line, LBL. This {{consists}} of an array {{of at least three}} transponders. The initial position of the transponders is determined by USBL and/ or by measuring the baselines between the transponders. Once that is done, only the ranges to the transponders need to be measured to determine a relative position. The position should theoretically be located at the intersection of imaginary spheres, one around each transponder, with a radius equal to the time between transmission and reception multiplied by the speed of sound through water. Because <b>angle</b> <b>measurement</b> is not necessary, the accuracy in large water depths is better than USBL.|$|E

Again, manifold means that locally at any point x of X, the space is homeomorphic to {{a subset of the}} real plane. The supplement [...] "Riemann" [...] signifies that X is endowed with an additional structure which allows <b>angle</b> <b>measurement</b> on the manifold, namely an equivalence class of so-called Riemannian metrics. Two such metrics are considered equivalent if the angles they measure are the same. Choosing an equivalence class of metrics on X is the additional datum of the conformal structure.|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} for estimating aerodynamic parameters {{in real time}} from flight data without air flow <b>angle</b> <b>measurements</b> is described and demonstrated. The method is applied to simulated F- 16 data, and to flight data from a subscale jet transport aircraft. Modeling results obtained with the new approach using flight data without air flow <b>angle</b> <b>measurements</b> were compared to modeling results computed conventionally using flight data that included air flow <b>angle</b> <b>measurements.</b> Comparisons demonstrated that the new technique can provide accurate aerodynamic modeling results without air flow <b>angle</b> <b>measurements,</b> which are often difficult and expensive to obtain.

2500|$|An electromechanically scanned {{parabolic}} E-band (10kW power) {{target acquisition}} radar {{is mounted on}} the rear top of the turret that when combined with the turret front mounted J-band (150kW power) monopulse tracking radar forms the 1RL144 (NATO:Hot Shot) radar system, which can detect and track targets flying high as 3,500 m. Alongside the 1A26 digital computer and the 1G30 <b>angle</b> <b>measurement</b> system form the 1A27 radar complex. Tunguska-M has the 1RL144M radar with detection range 18km and tracking range 16km-near of the original system's. The mechanically scanned target acquisition radar for the Tunguska-M1 offers a 360-degree field of view, a detection range of around 18km and can detect targets flying as low as 15 m, the target acquisition radar can be stowed when in transit. Its tracking radar has a range of 16km. A C/D-band IFF system is also fitted and designated 1RL138. The radar system is highly protected against various types of interference, and can work if there are mountains on the horizon, regardless of the background. [...] The system is able to fire on the move using 30mm cannons, although it must be stationary to fire missiles. The maximum target speed can be up to 500m/s; reaction time 6–8 seconds. Each 2S6 has all facilities for independent warfare.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of muscle fatigue on the proprioceptive accuracy of knee injured and surgical individuals. Ss were 18 control, 17 knee injured without surgery and 14 knee injured with surgery. Average time post-trauma for the non-surgical knee injured Ss was 11. 3 months and 11. 5 months for surgical knee Ss. All Ss were randomly tested on two separate occasions with either rest or fatigue treatment. at least 24 {{but not more than}} 48 hours was required between testings. One testing consisted of knee angle teaching followed by pre-rest <b>angle</b> <b>measurements,</b> the rest treatment and then post-rest <b>angle</b> <b>measurements.</b> The other testing consisted of knee angle teaching, pre-fatigue <b>angle</b> <b>measurements,</b> the fatigue treatment performed on the Cybex II isokinetic dynamometer, and post-fatigue <b>angle</b> <b>measurements.</b> Two <b>angles</b> were tested for knee replication, 30 and 60 degrees.

40|$|We {{developed}} and assessed a measuring device for intraoperative {{assessment of the}} acetabular index and center edge angle during acetabular reorientation in periacetabular osteotomy. We asked whether reliable assessment of angles could be made using the device; to be reliable we presumed the variability of <b>angle</b> <b>measurements</b> should not exceed that of inherent variability when assessing angles on radiographs (±  5 °). The device was mounted bilaterally on the pelvis, and using fluoroscopy, <b>angle</b> <b>measurements</b> were obtained with adjustable measuring discs. We conducted a cadaver study to assess intraobserver and interobserver variability of the device and to assess if pelvic positioning influenced variation of measurements. Intraoperative measurements of 35 consecutive patients were compared with measurements on postoperative radiographs. Intraoperatively obtained <b>angle</b> <b>measurements</b> differed less than ±  5 ° from measurements on postoperative radiographs and the intraobserver and interobserver variability of the device were confined within ± 5 °. Positioning did not influence the variation of <b>angle</b> <b>measurements</b> beyond intraobserver variability of the device when applying arcs of tilt and rotation of ± 12. 5 °. We believe the device is a potentially helpful tool in the periacetabular osteotomy. It is simple to use and facilitates repeated reliable <b>angle</b> <b>measurements</b> during acetabular reorientation, making intraoperative radiographs unnecessary...|$|R
