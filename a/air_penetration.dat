40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{survey on}} 68 dairy farms {{was carried out}} to {{evaluate}} the ensiling procedures adopted to store corn silage. Samples from core, lateral and apical zones of the feed-out face of silos were analysed. A principal factor analysis (PFA) was carried out on the entire database (196 silage samples and 36 variables) and 11 principal factor components (PCs) were retained and interpreted. RESULTS: Ensiling procedures influenced the area exposed to risk of <b>air</b> <b>penetration.</b> Cores had higher dry matter, starch and lactic acid content or lower pH, fibre, propionate and butyrate concentrations than peripheral samples (P < 0. 05). The highest (P < 0. 05) mycophenolic acid and roquefortina C concentrations were detected in lateral samples. Chemical and digestibility variables loaded on two PCs; four PCs were characterized by end-products associated with clostridia, heterolactic, homolactic and aerobic fermentations; two PCs were associated withmycotoxins, whereas three PCs explained ensiling procedures. CONCLUSION: The main quality traits of corn silages differed throughout the entire silo face. Minimization of the area exposed to risk of <b>air</b> <b>penetration</b> represents the best strategy to preserve the nutritional value and safety of corn silages. PFA allowed a clusterization of original variables into 11 PCs, appearing able to discriminate well and poorly preserved corn silages...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: As an {{alternative}} system to glass jars, mini-silo consisting of polypropylene (PP) container for laboratory studies of fermentation dynamics in silage was proposed {{in our previous}} study. However, suitability of this mini-silo was questioned, as {{there was a slight}} probability of <b>air</b> <b>penetration</b> into container, which would lead to silage deterioration. In this study, an improvement of the original mini-silo system for ensiling was undertaken. A non-transparent PP container was replaced with a see-through container made of co-polymer poly-propylene (PP), which had a lid with layer of silicon on its edge, which made this mini-silo practically air-proof. The lid was equipped with a special water valve, for releasing of gas products of the fermentation from the silage. Moreover, the see-through container made a provision for monitoring of micro-organisms growth and thus better explanation of the obtained results on silage microbiological status. The improved silage system was tested in an experiment in which alfalfa was compacted into transparent containers with addition of two bacterial inoculants. On day 50, percentage of silage surface covered with moulds was visually estimated and samples were taken for determination of total number of moulds and volatile fatty acids. Improved mini-silo system for silage laboratory studies proposed in this paper is simple, economical, practical and capable of preventing <b>air</b> <b>penetration</b> into the silage...|$|E

40|$|To {{a greater}} or lesser extent, most room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) absorb water from humid <b>air.</b> <b>Penetration</b> of water into the {{lubricating}} nanoscale film may affect its equilibrium structure and dynamic properties and thus influence the ability of RTILs as lubricants to reduce friction between solid surfaces. Here we investigate the impact of hydration on lubrication using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Water adsorption changes both the ionic liquid molecules’ orientation and the slip conditions at the solid–liquid interfaces, resulting in a reduced resistance against squeezing-out of the lubricant by an external load. For the same normal load, the film becomes thinner when water is present. We show that even small amounts of water can screen the electrostatic interactions between the ions, making RTILs more “fluid” and compressible and hence less resistant to external stress. The impact that screening has on friction involves several aspects that are systematically analyzed in this paper...|$|E

30|$|Cluster {{thinning}} {{is described}} as the suppression of flowers or clusters before full maturation [14]. Therefore, cluster thinning has a direct effect on the source/sink ratio; having less sinks (fruits) photosynthetic assimilation might be improved, increasing grape quality [15]. It inducts physiological adjustments in the plant, improving the maturation’s kinetics. Plus, this operation improves canopy sanitary conditions as thinning allows more enlightenment and fresh <b>air</b> <b>penetration</b> in the vegetation and clusters [16]. Cluster thinning’s most evident effect is apparently crop load reduction, but its decrease is not equivalent to the thinning’s intensity. Martins [17] found that, for the same intensity of thinning, in two consecutive years, the decline in production has been uneven. In fact, the vine compensates the stack lost, increasing the berry’s volume and weight [18]. For this reason, Climaco et al. [19] suggests that cluster thinning must only be executed in the years when vineyards have such a fertility that may possibly undermine production quality. Cluster thinning advances grape maturity, improves grape quality, and also influences the chromatic characteristic of the wine [20].|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} subsoil compaction, topsoil compaction, {{mechanical}} subsoiling with an excavator and pneumatic subsoiling using a Terralift soil aerator {{on a number}} of soil physical parameters and plant growth on five tree species, were measured at two sites with sandy loam and loam over clay loam, respectively. The compactions were made under controlled conditions before subsoiling and planting. Compaction had a negative influence on soil physics and plant growth. Soil bulk density was increased and pore volume, airfilled porosity at field capacity and <b>air</b> permeability decreased. <b>Penetration</b> resistance was higher for both sites compared to untreated controls. Plants had less yearly growth and were smaller than the plants in the controls, 4 years after planting. The excavator was used to study the ability of that method to reduce the negative effects of soil compaction. Results showed that soil bulk density was reduced and pore volume and airfilled porosity at field capacity had increased. Penetration resistance was lowered for both sites. Plants were, 4 years after planting, higher at the subsoiled sandy soil but not at the clay soil, compared with the controls. The effects of pneumatic subsoiling using a Terralift soil aerator was studied to test the equipments ability to solve soil physical problems in existing plantations. In the sandy loam, aeration led to a decreased bulk density, an increase in porosity (mainly as an increase in macro-porosity) and an increase in saturated hydraulic conductivity and <b>air</b> permeability. <b>Penetration</b> resistance was lowered at this site.
