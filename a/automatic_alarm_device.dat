50|$|While {{the cockpit}} is {{typically}} equipped with dual flight controls for two-man operations, the Dauphin {{can be readily}} flown by a single pilot while operating under instrument flight rules; this was achieved in part by avionics such as the 4-axis Dual Digital Automatic Flight Control System (older production aircraft use a 3-axis flight control system with integrated autopilot instead) to reduce crew workload. The principle flight control system are connected {{to a total of}} 3 dual-chamber primary servo-units for cyclical and collective pitch control, and a single dual-chamber rear servo-unit for tail rotor pitch control. Other major avionics include 10.4-inch multi-mission touch screen displays, weather radar, global positioning system (GPS) receiver, traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS), <b>automatic</b> voice <b>alarm</b> <b>device</b> (AVAD), health and usage monitoring system (HUMS), quick access records for helicopter flight data management, and digital audio communication system (DACS).|$|R

40|$|An outage {{of a power}} transformer, generally, has heavy {{financial}} {{consequences for}} electric power systems utilities. In order to prevent any failure and to optimize their maintenance, {{a growing number of}} operating parameters are measured on-line. The important amount of data together with the ever increasing number of units to be monitored calls for <b>automatic</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>devices.</b> Due to the complexity of power transformers, the evolution of the operating parameters is hardly known and, in fact, difficult to model. That is why the alarms, generally, start on thresholds defined independently for each recorded variable. With such an approach, neither variations in relation to operating conditions, nor existing relations between different monitored quantities are taken into consideration. This thesis is devoted to the study of an "intelligent" on-line monitoring system, able to adapt itself depending on those variations. The developed solution uses self-organizing maps (SOM). It consists of unsupervised neural networks inspired by the organization of cortical zones in the brains of mammals. Their characteristics enable them to represent a complex set of data in a generally dimensional space preserving at the same time, the topology of the original set as truthfully as possible. This work shows, more specifically, that these systems allow to model the different states of a transformer preserving not only the general structure of data, but also their local correlations. The topological preservation feature of the maps implies that close operating states will also be close on the map. Based on this observation, a powerful graphic interface is proposed to exploit qualitatively the measurement results. The monitoring is considered in the real context for which, in case of a defect, the transformer behaviour is generally unknown. This constraint resulted {{in the study of the}} self-organizing map response for states located outside the original model space. A confidence indicator quantifying the accuracy of the model response was proposed. It is shown that this indicator allows to define an adaptive alarm threshold that complements the developed tool for qualitative interpretation. The developed approach is finally validated using data collected on a pilot-transformer, operating in the Swiss electric network. The obtained results show the pertinence of the proposed technique and its ability to reveal any sudden change of one or several variables with a relatively sharp sensitivity...|$|R

Wireless sensor network {{has become the most}} important technology in environmental monitoring and home or factory automation in recent years. In this paper, an <b>automatic</b> fire <b>alarm</b> system based on wireless sensor networks is developed, which is designed for high-rise buildings. In order to provide early extinguishing of a fire disaster, large numbers of detectors which periodically measure smoke concentration or temperature are deployed in buildings.

40|$|Nuclear reactor plants {{include a}} turbine {{generator}} system (TGS) {{to convert the}} energy in steam from the {{nuclear steam supply system}} into electrical energy. The TGS consists essentially of the turbine unit and the <b>automatic</b> <b>devices,</b> <b>alarms,</b> and trips which control and regulate turbine action, and the generator unit and its Con-trols. The turbine control system and the steam inlet stop and control valves, the low pressure turbine steam intercept and inlet control valves, and the extraction steam control valves control the speed of the turbine under normal and abnormal conditions, and are thus related to the overall safe operation of the plant. The turbine generator system installed in a nuclear plant is typically equipped with redundant overspeed protection instrumentation and controls and the main steam and reheat steam control and stop valving arrangements typically provide redundancy in the valves essential for overspeed protection. The intent of the review under this SRP section is to verify that such redundancy, in conjunction with inservice inspection and testing of the essential valves, makes a turbine overspeed condition above the design overspeed very unlikely and to assure conformance with General Design Criterion 4. Assessment of the risk to essential plant systems and struc-tures from potential turbine missiles is reviewed under SRP Section 3. 5. 1. 3. 1. The PSB reviews the turbine generator system and the components and subsystems normally provided with this equipment with respect to the following considera-tions: a. The general arrangement of the turbine and associated equipment with respect to safety-related structures and systems and balance of plant. b.
