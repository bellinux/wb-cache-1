40|$|Daldinia macaronesica (from the Canary Islands and Madeira), D. palmensis (from the Canary Islands), D. martinii and D. raimundi (from Sicily), and D. vanderguchtiae (from Jersey, Channel Islands) spp. nov., are described, {{based on}} new {{combinations}} of teleomorphic and <b>anamorphic</b> <b>characters.</b> They all resemble the pantropical D. eschscholzii and/or the European D. concentrica {{with regard to}} teleomorphic characters and secondary metabolite profiles generated by analytical HPLC. The status of the newly described taxa was established by SEM of ascospores and microscopic studies of their anamorphs in comparison with various materials of the aforementioned known species. HPLC and SEM studies on the holotype of D. bakeri confirmed its relationships to D. fissa and D. loculata. Yellowish pigments contained in the type specimen of D. bakeri are probably artificial...|$|E
40|$|Coniothyrium-like coelomycetes {{are drawing}} {{attention}} as biological control agents, potential bioremediators, and producers of antibiotics. Four genera are currently used to classify such anamorphs, namely, Coniothyrium, Microsphaeropsis, Cyclothyrium, and Cytoplea. The morphological plasticity of these fungi, however, {{makes it difficult}} to ascertain their best generic disposition in many cases. A new genus, Paraconiothyrium is here proposed to accommodate four new species, P. estuarinum, P. brasiliense, P. cyclothyrioides, and P. fungicola. Their formal descriptions are based on <b>anamorphic</b> <b>characters</b> as seen in vitro. The teleomorphs of these species are unknown, but maximum parsimony analysis of ITS and partial SSU nrDNA sequences showed that they belong in the Pleosporales and group in a clade including Paraphaeosphaeria s. str., the biocontrol agent Coniothyrium minitans, and the ubiquitous soil fungus Coniothyrium sporulosum. Coniothyrium minitans and C. sporulosum are therefore also combined into the genus Paraconiothyrium. The anamorphs of Paraphaeosphaeria michotii and Paraphaeosphaeria pilleata are regarded representative of Paraconiothyrium, but remain formally unnamed. Paraconiothyrium species are phylogenetically distant from typical members of the other coelomycete genera mentioned abov...|$|E
40|$|The Pleosporaceae is an {{important}} loculoascomycete family. There has been disagreement, however, regarding the taxonomic placement of many genera within this family. This study investigates phylogenetic relationships among the genera Cochliobolus, Kirschsteiniothelia, Leptosphaerulina, Macroventuria, Pleospora, Pyrenophora, and Wettsteinina. Partial 28 S rDNA sequences from taxa within these genera were analyzed with maximum parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian methods. Cochliobolus can be segregated broadly into two groups as previously proposed. Pleospora is polyphyletic in its current sense. Taxa with Stemphylium anamorphs {{are closely related to}} Cochliobolus and fit within the Pleosporaceae, whereas the affinities of Pleospora herbarum and P. ambigua are still ambiguous. Pyrenophora constitutes a monophyletic group within the Pleosporaceae, whereas Leptosphaerulina and Macroventuria appear to share phylogenetic affinities with the Leptosphaeriaceae and Phaeosphaeriaceae. Phylogenies indicate that Wettsteinina should be excluded from the Pleosporaceae. Similar findings are reported for Kirschsteiniothelia, which is probably polyphyletic. <b>Anamorphic</b> <b>characters</b> appear to be significant (especially in Cochliobolus) while ascospore morphologies, such as shape and color and substrate occurrence are poor indicators of phylogenetic relationships among these loculoascomycetes. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{an optical}} anamorphosis, an object is seen {{distorted}} unless {{the viewer is}} positioned at a specific point, where the object appears normal. We describe how to endow a rational Free-Form Deformation with an <b>anamorphic</b> <b>character</b> in a simple manner, obtaining an AFFD (Anamorphic Free-Form Deformation). Given a (planar or 3 D) initial object, which will appear normal from the desired viewpoint, we deform the object with a rational Bézier surface or volume as deformation tool. To achieve the desired deformation, the user input amounts to displacing the control points of the deformation tool along radial directions through the viewpoint, whereas the weights come as a byproduct. Mathematically, the deformation means changing the last homogeneous coordinate of the control points. An AFFD defined by a linear Bézier tetrahedron {{can be regarded as}} a user-friendly way to construct a perspective collineation. In this case, or when the deformation tool is a Bézier triangle of degree one, the AFFD transforms NURBS to NURBS keeping the original degree. With a deformation tool of higher degree, the rational composition required to obtain the exact result yields NURBS also of higher degree. For a quadratic Bézier triangle as deformation tool, our AFFD coincides with the inverse of a stereographic projection...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Pattern recognition is a rapidly expanding area of research, with applications ranging from character recognition and component inspection to robotic guidance and military reconnaissance. The basic principle of image recognition is that of comparing the unknown image with many known reference images or 'filters', until a match is found. By comparing the unknown image with a large data bank of filters, {{the diversity of the}} application can be extended. The work presented in this thesis details the practical development of an optical disk based memory system as applied in various optical correlators for pattern recognition purposes. The characteristics of the holographic optical disk as a storage medium are investigated in terms of information capacity and signal to noise ratio, where a fully automated opto-mechanical system has been developed for the control of the optical disk and the processing of the information recorded. A liquid crystal television {{has been used as a}} Spatial Light Modulator for inputting the image data, and as such, the device characteristics have been considered with regard to processing both amplitude and phase information. Three main configurations of optical correlator have been applied, specifically an image plane correlator, a VanderLugt correlator, and an <b>Anamorphic</b> correlator. <b>Character</b> recognition has been used to demonstrate correlator performance, where simple matched filtering has been applied, subsequent to which, an improvement in class discrimination has been demonstrated with the application of the Minimum Average Correlation Energy filter. The information processing rate obtained as a result of applying 2 D parallel processing has been shown to be many orders of magnitude larger than that available with comparable serial based digital systems...|$|R
40|$|During a foray to the {{mountain}} rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a peculiar species of Xylariaceae was found, {{which could not be}} accommodated in any of the existing genera. It is recognised as representative of a new genus, named Ruwenzoria, owing to the presence of a new combination of teleomorphic and <b>anamorphic</b> <b>characters</b> that are regarded as significant for generic segregation within the Xylariaceae. Studies on its secondary metabolites in stromata and cultures by high performance liquid chromatography, coupled with diode array and mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-DAD/MS), and on its phylogenetic affinities based on 5. 8 S/ITS rDNA sequence data, respectively, revealed a close relationship of the new taxon to the genera Daldinia and Entonaema, from which it differs by having neither a hollow, gelatinous nor a conspicuously zonate stromatal interior, and an anamorph featuring enteroblastic rather than holoblastic conidiogenesis. A specimen from the same geographic region, previously identified as Daldinia bakeri by R. W. G. Dennis was found to constitute a mixture of stromata of Ruwenzoria and an additional, undescribed Daldinia species. The latter fungus is not formally described due to the scantiness of the material, but its morphological characteristics are illustrated...|$|E
