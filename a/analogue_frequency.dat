50|$|As {{part of the}} deal, CKMI {{moved from}} VHF channel 5 to UHF channel 20 using a {{transmitter}} at the Quebec City tower farm atop Mount Bélair.

50|$|Because of {{reception}} challenges, Daystar subsequently filed an application to permit WUDT to broadcast its digital signal on channel 23, its old <b>analogue</b> <b>frequency,</b> at 15 kW, directional.

On May 3, 2012, the station moved back to UHF 23, increasing power substantially from 300 to 15,000 watts.

50|$|The FCC {{was persuaded}} to {{allocate}} channel 69 (WPXQ's original <b>analogue</b> <b>frequency)</b> to Block Island by Ted Robinson, an island resident, who claimed during the allocation filing process in 1984-85 that an independent TV station providing niche programming from there would {{serve the public}} interest better. Robinson subsequently ran into local opposition to tower siting, and sold out his interest to Ray Yorke, who obtained the initial construction permit. The station began broadcasting {{a few hours of}} old movies daily in 1992 using the call WOST-TV (meaning Ocean State Television, the original owners). By 1996, the station was owned by Paxson Communications, which had implemented their infomercials (via their inTV network) and religious programming. The station became WPXQ in 1998, and in August of that year began to run programming from the Pax TV network (now Ion Television).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{developed}} {{network analyser}} with four ports allows very fast measurements of S-parameters in compari-son with a conventional network analyser. This is possible because highly linear <b>analogue</b> <b>frequency</b> ramps are used. Thus the settling times of stepped frequency sweeps of con-ventional analysers are eliminated. The required high linear-ity and high {{stability of the}} frequency ramps is achieved by using fractional divider phase locked loop circuits. For a practical realization {{it is necessary to}} accept small nonlinearities for the linear <b>analogue</b> <b>frequency</b> ramps. For this reason investigations were performed to clarify effects of small nonlinearities on the measurement precision. Nonlinearities are willingly implemented by programming the fractional frequency ramps accordingly. The gained ex-pertise allows for a further improvement of measurement ac-curacy and dynamic range. ...|$|E

40|$|Design {{of digital}} {{infinite}} impulse response (IIR) filters is a compulsory topic in most signal processing courses. Most often, it is taught {{by using the}} bilinear transform to map an analogue counterpart into the corresponding digital filter. The usual approach is to define a mapping between the complex variables s and z, and hence, by substitution, derive a mapping between ?, <b>analogue</b> <b>frequency,</b> and ?, sampled frequency. This is rather elliptical, since the real aim is to establish the correspondence between the frequency response of a prototype analogue system H(j?), and H(ej?), {{the response of the}} sampled system. Here we provide a rigorous analysis for the mutual invertibility between the <b>analogue</b> <b>frequency</b> ?, and the digital frequency ? for this case. Based upon the definition of the tan and arctan functions, conditions of existence, uniqueness and continuity of such a mutually inverse mapping are derived. Based upon these results, simple proofs for the mutually inverse mappings ??? and ??? are given. This is supported by appropriate diagrams. This problem arose as a student question while teaching DS...|$|E
40|$|The {{generation}} of <b>analogue</b> <b>frequency</b> ramps with non-fractional phase-locked-loops (PLL) is a cost {{effective way of}} linearising varactor controlled oscillators (VCO). In case that the VCO shows a high phase-noise level, a single non-fractional PLL {{is not able to}} suppress the phase-noise of the VCO sufficiently. The reason for this is the limited loopbandwidth of the PLL. In the field of precise measurements a high phase-noise level is mostly not tolerable. Examples of VCO-types with an extremely high phase noise level are integrated millimetre wave oscillators based on GaAs-HEMT technology. Both, a low quality factor of the resonator and a high flicker-noise corner frequency of the transistors are the main reason for the poor phase-noise behaviour. On the other hand this oscillator type allows a cost effective implementation of a millimetre-wave VCO. Therefore, a cascaded two-loop structure is presented that is able to linearise a VCO and additionally to reduce its phase-noise significantly...|$|E
40|$|A fast four channel network {{analyser}} is introduced to measure S-parameters in a frequency range from 10 MHz to 4 GHz. The measurement period {{of this kind}} of {{network analyser}} is short in comparison with a conventional one, which becomes possible by using highly linear <b>analogue</b> <b>frequency</b> ramps, realized with fractional divider phase locked loop circuits. The settling time for the discrete frequency points, which is typical for a conventional network analyser, is nearly eliminated by the use of frequency ramps. To achieve the necessary bandwidth of 4 GHz in the baseband, a heterodyne principle is applied. A VCO-signal from 5 to 9 GHz is down converted to the baseband with a fixed frequency generator of 9 GHz. The structure of the following network analyser is similar to the structure of a conventional four channel network analyser and therefore all known calibration techniques are suited for the fast network analyser. The intermediate frequency, which is necessary for the evaluation, carries the required information. However a special analysis technique is necessary. This technique is based on two Fourier transformations...|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / May 18 - 20, 1965 / Sheraton Park Hotel, Washington DCThis paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} performance of a frequency-modulated 10 watt S-band transmitter. <b>Analogue</b> <b>frequency</b> response is in excess of 7 Mc and digital signals at rates up to 10 megabits per second are transmitted satisfactorily.

A detailed analysis of rf bandwidth requirements and the state of the semiconductor art at the time of transmitter design resulted in the exciter taking the form of a 70 Mc voltage controlled oscillator whose output is amplified and converted to the S-band output frequency by means of broadband varactor harmonic generators. Production versions of this transmitter have consistently demonstrated satisfactory orbital operation.
