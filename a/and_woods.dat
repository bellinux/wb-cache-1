The route curves northeast and heads into the community of Pleasant Hall, where it passes homes and crosses PA 533. From here, PA 997 runs through a mix of farmland and woodland, crossing the Conodoguinet Creek into Lurgan Township. The road continues north and comes to an intersection with the northern terminus of PA 433 near the community of Lurgan. The route runs through more rural land and curves northwest, passing over the Conodoguinet Creek again and heading back into Letterkenny Township. PA 997 curves north and passes some residential development before heading into wooded areas and crossing the creek a third time and reentering Lurgan Township. At this point, the route heads into the community of Roxbury and comes to a junction with PA 641, where it turns east to follow that route, passing homes. PA 997 splits from PA 641 by turning northeast onto Cumberland Highway, heading through a mix of farmland <b>and</b> <b>woods</b> with some homes a short distance to the southeast of Blue Mountain. Farther northeast, the route passes businesses and comes to a ramp providing access to the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76) at the Blue Mountain interchange.
