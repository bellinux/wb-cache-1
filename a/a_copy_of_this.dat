5|$|In November 2005 Allingham {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} the International Holographic Portrait Archive to have his holographic portrait taken. His image was recorded for posterity in December 2005. At the same time, an exhibition was being planned for London's floating naval museum on board HMS Belfast, entitled the Ghosts of Jutland. <b>A</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> portrait was donated to the museum and HRH The Duchess of Gloucester unveiled the portrait to mark {{the opening of the}} exhibition.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{writer and}} director, Shigesato Itoi, pitched the game concept to Shigeru Miyamoto while visiting Nintendo's {{headquarters}} for other business. Though Miyamoto denied the proposal at first, he eventually gave Itoi a development team. The game {{was released in}} Japan on July 27, 1989. A North American version was localized into English, but was abandoned as commercially nonviable. <b>A</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> prototype was later found and circulated on the Internet under the unofficial, fan-created title EarthBound Zero to differentiate it from its officially-released sequel, EarthBound. The game was eventually released worldwide under the name EarthBound Beginnings for the Wii U Virtual Console on June 14, 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} type is the live bootleg, or {{audience}} recording, which is created with sound recording equipment smuggled into a live concert. Many artists and live venues prohibit this form of recording, but from the 1970s onwards the increased availability of portable technology made such bootlegging easier, and the general quality of these recordings has improved over time as consumer equipment becomes sophisticated. A number of bootlegs originated with FM radio broadcasts of live or previously recorded live performances. Other bootlegs may be soundboard recordings taken directly from a multi-track mixing console used to feed the public address system at a live performance. Artists may record their own shows for private review, but engineers may surreptitiously take <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> which ends up being shared. As a soundboard recording is intended to supplement the natural acoustics of a gig, a bootleg may have an inappropriate mix of instruments, unless the gig is so large that everything needs to be amplified {{and sent to the}} desk.|$|E

25|$|Frege's course exposed him to Bertrand Russell's work on {{logic and}} philosophy, which put {{a sense of}} the aims to his studies. He {{accepted}} the effort to surpass traditional philosophy with logical innovations that inform the sciences. He wrote a letter to Russell, who responded by copying by hand long passages from his Principia Mathematica for Carnap's benefit, as neither Carnap nor his university could afford <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> epochal work. In 1924 and 1925, he attended seminars led by Edmund Husserl, the founder of phenomenology, and continued to write on physics from a logical positivist perspective.|$|E
25|$|St Michael's most {{significant}} 17th-century {{feature is the}} monument to Francis Bacon, Viscount St Alban, who died in 1626. It is in a round-arched recess inserted for the purpose in the north wall of the chancel. The monument is a life-sized sculpture of Bacon seated in a relaxed pose in an armchair. The name of the sculptor is unknown, but {{it may have been}} Nicholas Stone. <b>A</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> statue, sculpted by Henry Weekes, was commissioned by William Whewell (Master of Trinity College, Cambridge between 1841 and 1866) and erected in the college chapel in 1845 to honour one of the college's most illustrious alumni.|$|E

25|$|The full span of memoirs {{eventually}} {{appeared in}} three parts—three volumes covering 1817 to 1837, published in 1874, three {{for the period}} from 1837 to 1852, published in 1885, and the final two in 1887, covering 1852 to 1860. When the first part appeared in 1874 some passages caused extreme offence. The copies issued were {{as far as possible}} recalled and passages suppressed, however <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> original manuscript remained in the Wallace family possession until it was sold and eventually acquired by a bookseller from New York, Gabriel Wells. Wells and the Doubleday publishing house produced The Greville Diary in two volumes in 1927 however these were criticised for poor editing and containing some inaccurate statements.|$|E
25|$|Industrial espionage was {{implicated in}} the {{capacitor}} plague, {{in connection with the}} theft of an electrolyte formula. A materials scientist working for Rubycon in Japan left the company, taking the secret water-based electrolyte formula for Rubycon's ZA and ZL series capacitors, and began working for a Chinese company. The scientist then developed <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> electrolyte. Then, some staff members who defected from the Chinese company copied an incomplete version of the formula and began to market it to many of the aluminium electrolytic manufacturers in Taiwan, undercutting the prices of the Japanese manufacturers. This incomplete electrolyte lacked important proprietary ingredients which were essential to the long-term stability of the capacitors and was unstable when packaged in a finished aluminum capacitor. This faulty electrolyte allowed the unimpeded formation of hydroxide and produced hydrogen gas.|$|E
25|$|A rare {{painting}} of his, , showing British surveyor John Henry Lefroy, {{which had been}} in possession of the Lefroy family in England, garnered a record price at an auction at Sotheby's in Toronto on February 25, 2002, when Canadian billionaire Kenneth Thomson won the bid at C$5,062,500 including the buyer's premium (US$3,172,567.50 at the time). Thomson subsequently donated the painting {{as part of his}} Thomson Collection to the Art Gallery of Ontario. The Glenbow Museum in Calgary has <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> painting that is thought to have been done by Kane's wife Harriet Clench. Another auction at Sotheby's on November 22, 2004, for Kane's oil painting Encampment, Winnipeg River (after the field sketch shown above) failed when bidding stopped at C$1.7 million, less than the expected sale price of C$2–2.5 million.|$|E

25|$|The chief {{separately}} published {{works of}} Ronsard are noted above. He produced, however, during his life {{a vast number}} of separate publications, some of them mere pamphlets or broadsheets, which from time to time he collected, often striking out others at the same time, in the successive editions of his works. Of these he himself published seven - the first in 1560, the last in 1584. Between his death and the year 1630 ten more complete editions were published, the most famous of which is the folio of 1609. <b>A</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> presented by Sainte-Beuve to Victor Hugo, and later in the possession of Maxime du Camp, has a place of its own in French literary history. The work of Claude Binet in 1586, Discours de la vie de Pierre de Ronsard, is very important for early information, and the author seems to have revised some of Ronsard's work under the poet's own direction.|$|E
25|$|During his {{period at}} Contimporanul, Dan {{embarked}} on a conflict with the Surrealist and far leftist group at unu, the magazine of poet Sașa Pană. This controversy reflected the major discrepancies between Contimporanul and other avant-garde venues. By 1930, Sergiu's brother Mihail Dan had left Bilete de Papagal and had become involved with unu, {{of which he was}} later editor in chief. However, documents first made public in 2008 show that he was secretly an informant for the Kingdom of Romania's intelligence agency, Siguranța Statului, with a mission to supervise unus ongoing flirtations with communism. He had for long been suspected of this by the literary society at Sburătorul. Also in 1930, shortly after the forceful return of Romanian King Carol II to the throne, Sergiu Dan was working, as political editor, on the staff of Dreptatea, the platform of the National Peasants' Party (PNȚ). According to the later account of communist journalist Petre Pandrea, Dan and Vinea together stole the original draft of an article by PNȚ economist Virgil Madgearu, and forged it in such manner as to make it seem that Madgearu was an anti-Carlist; they then sold a copy to Madgearu's rival, the corporatist theorist Mihail Manoilescu. Manoilescu took <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> document to Carol, discrediting himself when the forgery was exposed. Pandrea claimed that, between them, Dan and Vinea made off with 150,000 lei from the affair, whereas their victim Manoilescu fell into permanent disfavor.|$|E
