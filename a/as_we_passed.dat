[...] In our game with Michigan, we had two men {{instructed}} to play against Schulz and at times three and four were opposed to him. [...] For some time, he handed out as much <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> to him in the roughing end of the game. [...] He was here, there and everywhere. He did most of the tackling. [...] He broke up innumerable plays. [...] He was the star of the contest until the continued battering of our men injured him {{to such an extent that}} he had to retire. [...] The rest was easy".

Jemison was a co-investigator of two bone cell research experiments, one of 43 investigations that were done on STS-47. Jemison also conducted experiments on weightlessness and motion sickness on herself and six other crew members. [...] "The first thing I saw from space was Chicago, my hometown," [...] said Jemison. [...] "I was working on the middeck where there aren't many windows, and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> over Chicago, the commander called me up to the flight deck. It was such a significant moment because since I was a little girl I had always assumed I would go into space," [...] Jemison added. Despite NASA's rigid protocol, Jemison would begin each shift with a salute that only a Trekkie could appreciate. [...] "Hailing frequencies open," [...] she could be heard repeating throughout the eight-day mission.|$|E
