40|$|A well Grado- 1 was drilled down to 1108 m {{reaching}} mesozoic shelf carbonates which {{occur in}} the structural highs in the Lignano – Grado area. The well was completed with geophysical logs in the open hole interval from - 700 to - 1108 m. The drilling bit met the nummulitic shelf paleogenic limestones at - 616, 5 m and Mesozoic (Upper Cretaceous) platform around - 1007 m. About 400 m thick Palaeogene interval appears affected by open fractures which we consider linked up to a reverse fault and a tectonic duplex of the Palaeogene limestone interval is hypothesized.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of a working group on rocky coast in Italy in 2006 have permitted to organize several activities (meetings and excursions) and therefore to prepare an inventory of Italian rocky coasts. At these activities have participated {{the authors of the}} present abstract, which have indicated from time in time the characters of the visited coasts performed in these two years. Such coasts was selected {{in order to have a}} wide inventory where cliff in different geological regimes (tectonically stable, volcano-tectonically <b>active)</b> and lithology (<b>limestone,</b> terrigenous, volcanic) are represented. The aim of this group is to improve the knowledge of the factors having a role in the evolution of the rocky coasts, also in view of the 7 th IAG/AIG Conference as well as in the efficacy of the answers to give at the coastal management. In Italy rocky coasts are the most diffuse interface between land and sea, however their characters are various in the form and size of the cliff (subaerial and submerged), in the nature and mechanical condition of the outcropped litotype, in the geological and geomorphological inheritance (i. e. thrust, sea notches) or in the type of the anthropogenic action (activity and/or engineering structures). The analysis of such characters, integrated in some case with a continuous monitoring, have permitted to define some models able to account for the geomorphological evolution of the cliffs, according to the predominant litotipe (hard or weak or loose), its profile (i. e. the presence of a shore platform) and, at last, the coastal regime. The other factors could be quicken or slacken the rate of retreat, but they are not relevant in the development of the model. The role of climate in terms of rainfall and temperature is roughly the same (Mediterranean Group), even if we considered cliffs far away more than 1000 km...|$|R
30|$|The {{absence of}} <b>active</b> <b>limestone</b> is {{probably}} {{related to its}} positive relationship with organic matter.

In fact, the estimation of organic matter level is based on the content of soil clays and that of limestone (Soltner 2000).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Although soil {{is one of}} {{the factors}} in the biology of Tuber melanosporum (black truffle of Périgord), which {{has been the subject of}} much study, there are few {{quantitative}} analyses relating to its effects on carpophore production. The aim of this work is to establish the statistical relationship between T. melanosporum productivity in 20 soil surface horizons and their conventional soil properties (granulometric texture, pH, calcareous fractions, organic carbon, total nitrogen, exchangeable cations). The study area is situated in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula under a Mediterranean climate. Statistical analysis shows that the collective influence of these conventional soil features is low, as principal component analysis explains only 27 % of the variance in T. melanosporum production. However, a high percentage of <b>active</b> <b>limestone</b> (calcium carbonate extractable with ammonium oxalate) accounts for 40 % of the variance in T. melanosporum production. <b>Active</b> <b>limestone</b> is very important to T. melanosporum because it regulates soil pH and exchangeable Ca 2 + availability and participates in the organisation andmaintenance of the soil structure; it also plays a role in the truffle’s nutrition. These results obtained for <b>active</b> <b>limestone</b> may be of use in truffle cultivation...|$|E
30|$|Sulphate {{concentrations}} {{are greater}} than those of chlorides. They are, roughly, {{the same for all}} samples. However, the soils south of the Sebkha contain significantly more. These relatively high rates are related to the Triassic gypsum contributions of the Tessala. Chlorides appear relatively homogeneous but in small quantities. Throughout the chemical analyses, only the sample in the Sebkha showed a significant rate. The analyses show that soil levels have zero <b>active</b> <b>limestone.</b> The latter would be represented by the percentage of the clayey fraction below 2  µm (absent on the particle curves), which allows to avoid the appearance of the phenomenon of chlorosis.|$|E

40|$|Pisana' {{is a new}} apricot cultivar, {{resulting}} from Pisa University's breeding programme, with low vigour, late blooming and ripening and self-compatibility, but with very few flowers. The fruit is very big, attractive and delicious. A trial {{was carried out in}} northern Italy, in the dry sandy soil of the Berici hills, near Vicenza, in order to evaluate the behaviour of cultivar 'Pisana' on several rootstocks. Fifteen rootstocks were tested (10 lines of apricot seedlings and 6 Prunus clones). In the dry conditions of the Berici hills, with an <b>active</b> <b>limestone</b> (calcium carbonate) content higher than 8 %, the best performance came from apricot seedlings, with great differences between lines. They began to crop in the third year: the average crop per tree ranged between 45 and 60 kg, with an average fruit weight of 70 g. The refractomer index was never lower than 14 - 15 degrees Brix. The Prunus clones suffered due to the sandy soil and the lack of water and induced a higher sensitivity to trunk bacterial canker...|$|E
40|$|Our {{objective}} is to study interaction between {{physical and chemical properties}} of soils and their earthworm community characteristics in different areas irrigated by wastewaters and well waters. The fields have different topography and agricultural practices conditions and are located in two regions of Batna department (Eastern Algeria). Both regions are characterized by a semiarid climate with cold winters and Calcisol soils. Nine fields were subject of this study. Three of these fields are located in Ouled Si Slimane region whose irrigation is effectuated by natural waters of Kochbi effluent. The other six fields are located at edges ﻿of Wed El Gourzi, effluent from Batna city, and partially treated through water treatment station. The best rates of water saturation and infiltration as well as abundance of earthworms were recorded at sites characterized by irrigation with wastewaters downstream of El Gourzi effluent. PCA characterizes two major groups: a group of hydrodynamic infiltration parameters and structural index stability of soil, explained by fields irrigated with wastewaters downstream of El Gourzi effluent. This group includes chemical characteristics: pH and electric conductivity. The second group is the characteristics of earthworms and includes organic matter content, <b>active</b> <b>limestone</b> levels, and Shannon Biodiversity Index...|$|E
40|$|Since 2006, a {{broadcasting}} {{tower and}} ancillary {{buildings on the}} top of a hill adjacent to a large, <b>active</b> <b>limestone</b> quarry, in northern Italy near the village of Valcava, has been heavily damaged by ground deformation due to slope instability. In 2005, the quarry began to work the slope toward the broadcasting plant, releasing bedding planes that affected the tower site: a number of fractures occurred in the warehouse and in the ground around it, that grew particularly during significant rainfalls. In October 2006 a landslide occurred in the quarry area, close to the broadcasting site. In order to understand what induced the fracture process in the buildings and define a support system to stabilize the broadcasting site, a detailed geotechnical survey and a number of numerical slope stability analyses were carried out. One of the main goals of the paper is to underline the effectiveness of the numerical analyses to understand the instability phenomena when they are particularly complex. Furthermore, by using a reliable numerical model with a good understanding of site geology and of the main geotechnical parameters, an evaluation of the slope behavior under different scenarios was made and stabilization measures can be designe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Limestone is {{commonly}} used for neutralization of acid mine drainage (AMD). Its main advantages are its lower price, sustained generation of alkalinity and production of low sludge volumes. Nevertheless, armouring of limestone by ferric hydroxides {{is a problem in}} oxic limestone drains and in <b>active</b> <b>limestone</b> treatment systems, reducing the efficiency of the process. Due to these disadvantages, there is a permanent search for cheaper and more effective neutralization agents. Many alkaline industrial wastes are gaining importance in the treatment of AMD. The possibilities to use two different industrial by-products, red mud from a bauxite exploitation and low grade magnesium hydroxide from a magnesite mine, as neutralizing and bacterial inhibiting agents, and the comparison with conventional limestone treatment has been studied in this paper. An AMD from Rio Tinto mine site with an initial pH of 2. 4 and a ferric concentration of 1 g/L was used. Comparative test were done percolating the AMD in a continuous form with a peristaltic pump through three different columns filled with limestone, red mud and low grade magnesite, during one month and in same conditions of flow rate and amount of each compound used to fill the columns. The evolution of pH, iron and heavy metals, sulphates and microbial populations in the percolate were monitored at different times...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} {{landscape}} concept and evaluations {{and is based on}} some issues related to the impact, restoration and ecological potential of the abandoned quarries. It proposes a landscape character assessment for non <b>active</b> <b>limestone</b> quarries resulting from the spontaneous succession. Taking into account the guidelines of the European Landscape Convention (Conseil de l'Europe, 2000), this work has for objectives (1) to describe these landscape areas and (2) to assess the landscape aesthetic quality. To achieve these goals, two methods inspired by the Landscape Character Assessment (LCA) were tested. The first one is a field sheet and the second one a landscape perception survey with stakeholders. The results have emphasized the natural, harmonious and unique character of these landscapes. The key characteristics are the visual importance of cliffs, water bodies, vegetation forms and the landform in bleachers. Furthermore, color contrast and textures from vegetation, rock and water were also relevant. An apparent aesthetic landscape quality was perceived and the study showed that respondents are feeling good in the site surveyed. The quarryscape can be characterized of challenging, attractive, wild with an important degree of naturality but not really safe. Cultural, historic, symbolic and ecological values were also highlighted as a potential. These later observations take part in a landscape dynamic and allow to open the debate concerning the need for landscape interventions within these sites and the profit we could benefit from if security issues were well-managed...|$|E
40|$|Karst {{features}} in west-central Florida play a dominant {{role in the}} hydrogeologic framework of the region. Urban development in karst regions present unique problems for land- and water-resource managers and can potentially impact both land and water resources if not managed adequately. Understanding how karst features control ground-water flow and respond to varying hydrologic conditions is critical for effective long-term planning and resource management. This field guide highlights the karst features of west-central Florida and the geologic units of the region that define the hydrogeologic framework and influence ground-water flow and transport. The four field trip stops include: (1) an <b>active</b> <b>limestone</b> quarry where the representative carbonate units {{can be seen in}} cross section; (2) a dry cave system that intersects land surface showing where dissolution activity has created cavities that range from subterranean conduits to large caverns; (3) Chassahowitzka Springs, a coastal spring complex, where flooded karst features form spring vents, fissures, and highly-eroded limestone at or near land surface; and (4) Health Springs, a coastal spring located 2, 500 feet down gradient from a golf course and waste-water treatment plant with a spray-effluent facility. At Health Springs, the existence of a preferential ground-water flow path was documented by timing the movement of artificially dyed ground water between a well in the spray field and the spring. Ground water from the upgradient area has impacted the spring by increasing nitrate concentrations above background levels. These stops provide an opportunity to examine various karst features typical of Florida, especially {{in the context of their}} susceptibility to impact from land- and water-resource development activities...|$|E
40|$|A central aim in fault {{mechanics}} is {{to understand}} the microphysical mechanisms controlling aseismic-seismic transitions in fault gouges, and to identify microstructural indicators for such transitions. We present new data on the slip stability of calcite fault gouges, and on microstructural development down to the nanometer scale. Our experiments consisted of direct shear tests performed dry at slip rates of 0. 1 – 10 μm/s, at a constant normal stress of 50 MPa, at 18 – 150 °C. The results show a transition from stable to (potentially) unstable slip above 80 °C. All samples recovered showed an optical microstructure characterized by narrow, 30 – 40 -μm-wide, Riedel and boundary shear bands marked by extreme grain comminution, and a crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO). Boundary shear bands, sectioned using FIB-SEM (focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy), revealed angular grain fragments decreasing from 10 to 20 μm at the outer margins to 0. 3 μm in the shear band core, where dense aggregates of nanograins also occurred. Transmission electron microscopy, applied to foils extracted from boundary shears using FIB-SEM, combined with the optical CPO, showed that these aggregates consist of calcite nanocrystals, 5 – 20 nm in size, with the (104) [201] dislocation glide system oriented parallel to the shear plane and direction. Our {{results suggest that the}} mechanisms controlling slip include cataclasis and localized crystal plasticity. Because crystal plasticity is strongly thermally activated, we infer that the transition to velocity-weakening slip is likely due to enhanced crystal plasticity at > 80 °C. This implies that tectonically <b>active</b> <b>limestone</b> terrains will tend to be particularly prone to shallow-focus seismicity...|$|E
40|$|We {{report an}} {{experimental}} and microstructural {{study of the}} frictional properties of simulated fault gouges prepared from natural limestone (96 % CaCO 3) and pure calcite. Our experiments consisted of direct shear tests performed, under dry and wet conditions, at an effective normal stress of 50 MPa, at 18 – 150 °C and sliding velocities of 0. 1 – 10 μm/s. Wet experiments used a pore water pressure of 10 MPa. Wet gouges typically showed a lower steady-state frictional strength (μ = 0. 6) than dry gouges (μ = 0. 7 – 0. 8), {{particularly in the case}} of the pure calcite samples. All runs showed a transition from stable velocity strengthening to (potentially) unstable velocity weakening slip above 80 – 100 °C. All recovered samples showed patchy, mirror-like surfaces marking boundary shear planes. Optical study of sections cut normal to the shear plane and parallel to the shear direction showed both boundary and inclined shear bands, characterized by extreme grain comminution and a crystallographic preferred orientation. Cross-sections of boundary shears, cut normal to the shear direction using focused ion beam—SEM, from pure calcite gouges sheared at 18 and 150 °C, revealed dense arrays of rounded, ~ 0. 3 μm-sized particles in the shear band core. Transmission electron microscopy showed that these particles consist of 5 – 20 nm sized calcite nanocrystals. All samples showed evidence for cataclasis and crystal plasticity. Comparing our results with previous models for gouge friction, we suggest that frictional behaviour was controlled by competition between crystal plastic and granular flow processes active in the shear bands, with water facilitating pressure solution, subcritical cracking and intergranular lubrication. Our data have important implications for the depth of the seismogenic zone in tectonically <b>active</b> <b>limestone</b> terrains. Contrary to recent claims, our data also demonstrate that nanocrystalline mirror-like slip surfaces in calcite(-rich) faults are not necessarily indicative of seismic slip rates...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{competition between}} the various peach-growing countries {{in different parts of}} the world makes it necessary to engage in continuous innovation and refinement of orchard management techniques, in order to reduce production costs and ensure the profit margins that are indispensable for the survival of fruit peach industry. The decisions taken at the moment of orchard establishment, aiming at quanti-qualitative maximization of fruit production at the lowest production costs, thus become of crucial strategic importance. In this perspective, the paper examines two factors considered to be of fundamental importance in orchard design: choice of the rootstock regarded as most suitable in terms of soil, degree of vigor induced in the scion varieties and resistance to biotic and abiotic stress; choice of the appropriate planting system, which implies knowledge of the tree's response to the planting density training systems and pruning techniques. Choice of rootstock is becoming increasingly difficult as a result of the availability of numerous new rootstocks. Therefore, careful attention is paid to the various factors involved: in particular, for each of the problems considered we provide an internationally recognized list of stocks representing the best option for overcoming such problems. Among the most important nursery characteristics, emphasis is placed on aspects linked to propagation techniques and graft compatibility of the various stocks. As regards characteristics induced in the grafted cultivar, special attention is devoted to the degree of vigor, productivity and fruit quality. Finally, resistance of the main available rootstocks to the most serious abiotic (<b>active</b> <b>limestone,</b> soil sickness, waterlogging, drought, winter cold) and biotic (nematodes, fungi, bacteria, soil sickness and PTSL) sources of stress is described. Subsequently, we report on the results of a worldwide survey showing that open vase and just a few other traditional training systems still represent the standard in peach orchards. This suggests that choice of orchard design and planting density is influenced above all by factors other than the maximization of photosynthetic efficiency, rapid entry into production, or orchard management techniques. In order to seek to clarify the conditions underlying this situation, we offer an overview of the main factors to be taken into consideration in designing an orchard system and which can favor the technical-economic success of the orchard. We briefly describe the advantages and disadvantages of the various training systems currently used for low (400 - 600 trees/ha; open vase and its variants, Californian vase, etc.), medium (600 - 1, 000 trees/ha; palmette and its variants, delayed vase) and high (1, 000 - 2, 000 trees/ha; spindle, transverse Y and its variants, KACV) planting systems...|$|E
