50|$|Sulfamic acid, {{also known}} as <b>amidosulfonic</b> <b>acid,</b> amidosulfuric acid, aminosulfonic acid, and sulfamidic acid, is a {{molecular}} compound with the formula H3NSO3. This colorless, water-soluble compound finds many applications. Sulfamic acid melts at 205 °C before decomposing at higher temperatures to H2O, SO3, SO2, and N2.|$|E
40|$|Hydrated {{compounds}} {{prepared in}} aqueous solution by reaction between <b>amidosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> [H 3 NSO 3] and suspensions of rare earth hydroxycarbonates [Ln 2 (OH) x(CO 3) y. zH 2 O] were characterized by elemental analysis (% Ln, % N and % H), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetry (TG). The compounds presented the stoichiometry Ln(NH 2 SO 3) 3. xH 2 O (where x = 1, 5, 2. 0 or 3. 0). The IR spectra showed absorptions characteristic of H 2 O molecules and NH 2 SO 3 groups. Degree of hydration, thermal decomposition steps and formation of stable intermediates of the type [Ln 2 (SO 4) 3] and (Ln 2 O 2 SO 4), besides formation of their oxides, was determined by thermogravimetry...|$|E
40|$|Ephraim and Lasocky (1) {{reported}} {{the preparation of}} methyl amidosulfonate from methyl iodide and silver amidosulfonate in 1911. No further investigation of this compound or its homologues has since been reported. The present study was undertaken {{with the hope of}} obtaining ethyl amidosulfonate and then studying its properties. Preparation of <b>Amidosulfonic</b> <b>Acid.</b> —Amidosulfonic acid may be obtained by saturating an aqueous solution of hydroxylamine hydro-chloride, or better hydroxylamine sulfate, with sulfur dioxide. A more economic course, however, was pursued. Sodium amidosulfonate was prepared by the reduction of sodium nitrite with sulfur dioxide in the presence of sodium carbonate. The acid was then liberated from the sodium salt with sulfuric acid (2). Well-formed crystals of this colorless acid were easily obtained. The acid has a sharp sour taste. The yields were 50 to 60 % (Table la). Preparation of Silver Amidosulfonate. —Although Divers and Hag...|$|E
30|$|Fluorine-modified {{tin oxide}} (FTO)-coated glasses were {{immersed}} in isopropanol with saturated KOH solution for 24  h to remove absorbed organics, followed by ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, ethanol, and distilled water successively for 25  min. Fe films were prepared by constant current (20  mA[*]•[*]cm− 2) electrodeposition on the FTO for 120, 180, and 360  s. The deposition solution consists of 48  g ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4 [*]·[*] 7 H 2 O, ≥ 99.0  %, Greagent), 1.2  g ascorbic acid (C 6 H 8 O 6, ≥ 99.7  %, Greagent), 0.4  g <b>amidosulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> (H 2 NSO 3 H, ≥ 99.0  %, Greagent), 12  g boric acid (H 3 BO 3, ≥ 99.5  %, Greagent), and 800  mL distilled water. Electrodeposition {{was carried out}} in a standard three-electrode configuration consisting of a Pt foil counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (saturated by 3  M KCl), and a FTO working electrode. After electrodeposition, the α-Fe 2 O 3 films will be formed by post annealing process in the muffle furnace immediately at 150  °C for 2  h then up to 520  °C for 4  h with a heating rate of 2  °C•min- 1.|$|E
