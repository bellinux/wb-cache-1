50|$|Mean {{reversion}} is {{a mathematical}} methodology sometimes used for stock investing, {{but it can}} be applied to other processes.

An example of a mean-reverting process is the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic equation.|$|R

5|$|To {{compete in}} this market, Roberts needed more capital. He took MITS public in November 1973 with <b>a</b> <b>stock</b> {{offering}} of 500,000 shares at $1 each. The 1973 oil crisis caused <b>a</b> <b>stock</b> market downturn and MITS was {{only able to}} sell 250,000 shares. This allowed MITS {{to pay off the}} existing debt, but did not allow for any expansion. Roberts had developed several test equipment products such as a Waveform Generator and a Digital Voltmeter so he attempted to appeal to kit builders again by featuring the test equipment and digital clocks in the advertisements, instead of calculators. MITS was losing money, and by July 1974, the full page prominent ads were replaced with quarter-page ads {{in the back of the}} magazine.|$|E

5|$|All Bismarck's {{resources}} were deployed; he even asked Empress Victoria {{to use her}} influence with her son on his behalf. But the wizard had lost his magic; his spells were powerless because they were exerted on {{people who did not}} respect them, and he who had so signally disregarded Kant's command to use people as ends in themselves had too small <b>a</b> <b>stock</b> of loyalty to draw on. As Lord Salisbury told Queen Victoria: 'The very qualities which Bismarck fostered in the Emperor in order to strengthen himself when the Emperor Frederick should come to the throne have been the qualities by which he has been overthrown.' The Empress, with what must have been a mixture of pity and triumph, told him that her influence with her son could not save him for he himself had destroyed it.|$|E

His father bailed him out of his deprivation, and he returned to working at the Ritz. From 1930 until 1932, he was a backfield coach for the Temple Owls football team. In 1932, Marshall tried to coax Bell into buying the rights to a NFL franchise, but Bell disparaged the league and ridiculed the idea. When Pop Warner was hired to coach Temple for the 1933 season, Warner chose to hire his own assistants and Bell was let go.|$|E
5|$|By now the pre-war {{electrification}} scheme {{had been}} revived. In 1957 electrification between Rickmansworth and Amersham and Chesham began. Chalfont& Latimer's platforms were extended {{and a second}} platform was opened at Chesham on 3 July 1960 to prevent through operations to and from Baker Street from interfering with the Chesham–Chalfont& Latimer shuttle. An electric service using London Underground T Stock began operations between Chesham and Chalfont& Latimer on 16 August 1960, with former MR electric locomotives hauling the through trains to and from London. A steam locomotive was kept on standby in the new second platform at Chesham, {{in case of a}} failure of the electric trains.

30|$|The first measure used in {{this study}} is the stock {{volatility}} calculated as the standard deviation of daily stock returns in the calendar year. Volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for <b>a</b> given <b>stock</b> which represents total risk. Commonly, the higher the volatility, the riskier the stock is. In other words, volatility refers to the amount of uncertainty or risk about the size of changes in <b>a</b> <b>stock’s</b> value. <b>A</b> higher volatility means that <b>a</b> <b>stock’s</b> value can potentially be spread out over a larger range of values. This means that the price of the stock can change dramatically over a short time period in either direction. A lower volatility means that <b>a</b> <b>stock’s</b> value does not fluctuate dramatically, but changes in value at a steady pace over a period of time.|$|R
