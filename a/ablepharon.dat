40|$|We {{report on}} a 7 -year-old girl with unequivocal {{features}} of Barber-Say syndrome (BSS) : generalized hypertrichosis especially at the back, dry lax skin, macrostomia, thin lips, cup-shaped ears, bulbous nose, hypoplastic nipples, and abnormal external genitalia. She also demonstrated conductive hearing impairment and microblepharon. BSS has been reported with ectropion (not present in our patient), but <b>ablepharon</b> and microblepharon (i. e., absent or hypoplastic eyelids) have always been considered as hallmarks of <b>ablepharon</b> macrostomia syndrome (AMS). This is the first report of microblepharon in BSS. Other authors have discussed that BSS and AMS could possibly represent one syndrome, and our report supports this hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Three siblings, two {{females and}} one male, with the rare disease, cryptophthalmos, are {{reported}} on. Cryptophthalmos is usually familiar, inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The clinical manifestations {{indicate that the}} eyeball is present but disorganised; the lid muscles, extraocular muscles, and the nerve elements controlling ocular movements in the brain are developed. Treatment is of no avail, but in unilateral cases the partial lid coloboma, anterior symblepharon, and corneal pacification of the opposite eye may be somewhat improved by surgery. Cryptophalmos is a rare congenital anomaly characterised by an uninterrupted continuity of {{the skin of the}} forehead with that of the cheek, resulting in total <b>ablepharon.</b> It was first reported in 1872 by Zehender and Manz, ' and only two cases have been presented in China. 2 3 A family is now reported here in which three of the five siblings were affected (Fig...|$|E

40|$|<b>Ablepharon</b> macrostomia {{syndrome}} (AMS) and Barber-Say syndrome (BSS) {{are rare}} congenital ectodermal dysplasias characterized by similar clinical features. To establish the genetic basis of AMS and BSS, we performed extensive clinical phenotyping, whole exome and candidate gene sequencing, and functional validations. We identified a recurrent {{de novo mutation}} in TWIST 2 in seven independent AMS-affected families, as well as another recurrent de novo mutation affecting the same amino acid in ten independent BSS-affected families. Moreover, a genotype-phenotype correlation was observed, because the two syndromes differed based solely upon {{the nature of the}} substituting amino acid: a lysine at TWIST 2 residue 75 resulted in AMS, whereas a glutamine or alanine yielded BSS. TW 1 ST 2 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that regulates the development of mesenchymal tissues. All identified mutations fell in the basic domain of TWIST 2 and altered the DNA-binding pattern of Flag- 1 'WIST 2 in HeLa cells. Comparison of wild-type and mutant TW 1 ST 2 expressed in zebrafish identified abnormal developmental phenotypes and widespread transcriptome changes. Our results suggest that autosomal-dominant TW 1 ST 2 mutations cause AMS or BSS by inducing protean effects on the transcription factor's DNA binding...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Dysmorphology is {{the field}} of {{medicine}} focusing on congenital developmental abnormalities due to exogenous teratogens, chromosomal anomalies, or to a defect in a single gene. Numerous syndromes have been reported {{and a growing number}} of genes or chromosomal anomalies are identified. The clinical observation of the face remains an essential part of the clinical evaluation of the patients. The orbital region, as other regions of the face, should be systematically evaluated. Orbital malformations can be isolated or part of a syndrome. In the diagnostic process, the orbital anomaly can be classified as a major feature (essential for the diagnosis), a moderate feature (important but not essential for the diagnosis), or a minor feature (contributing weakly to the diagnosis). The diagnoses of the main orbital anomalies in dysmorphology are reviewed and illustrated with relevant examples of syndromes that are presented as well as the usual landmarks used in clinical practice. Abnormal position of the eyes in syndromes such as hypertelorism, hypotelorism, primary or secondary telecanthus, asymmetry, and proptosis are discussed. Eyelid anomalies, such as cryptophthalmos, <b>ablepharon,</b> blepharophimosis, euryblepharon, or anomalies at the level of the eyelashes and eyebrows ar...|$|E
40|$|Nonsyndromic {{syndactyly}} is a common, heterogeneous hereditary {{condition of}} webbed {{fingers and toes}} that can be cutaneous or bony, unilateral or bilateral. We describe a patient with complex toe syndactyly and oligodactyly, some interesting skeletal hand findings and atypical facial features without other case like this described before. Cenani-Lenz syndrome (CLS) is a rare disorder with total syndactyly and irregular synostosis of carpal, metacarpal and phalanges, it may involve ulna and radius and digital rays may be absent, some of these were described with atypical facial features and one patient had renal hypoplasia and vertebral anomalities but our patient {{does not have the}} oligodactyly or syndactyly of the hands that is consistently present in all patients with CLS. the atypical facial features of our patient resemble Kabuki syndrome but oligodactyly and complex Syndactyly have not been described in Kabuki syndrome and this patient has normal intelligence, and extreme eyelid defect (resembling <b>ablepharon).</b> Therefore, for our patient, we suggested to treat in a new condition of limb anomalies and atypical face.
