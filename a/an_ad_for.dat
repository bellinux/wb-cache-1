An entire page of the Edmonton Bulletin was devoted to the reopening, including a congratulating ad from a local record store, <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>for</b> the electrical contractors who installed the wiring, and a message congratulating the Princess placed by the managers of three other establishments already wired for sound: the Rialto, Empress and Capitol Theatres. The physical renovations necessary to accommodate the new wiring were carried out by S. H. Muttart, an important local builder and namesake of the Muttart Conservatory in Edmonton’s River Valley.

5|$|DiCaprio's {{career began}} with his {{appearance}} in several commercials and educational films. After being {{removed from the}} set of children's television series Romper Room for being disruptive {{at the age of}} five, he followed his older stepbrother Adam Farrar into television commercials, landing <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>for</b> Matchbox cars at 14. In 1990, he got his break on television when he was cast in the short-lived series based on the movie Parenthood. After Parenthood, DiCaprio had bit parts on several shows, including The New Lassie and Roseanne, as well as a brief stint on the soap opera Santa Barbara, playing the young Mason Capwell. His involvement in Parenthood and the daily soap earned him a nomination for the Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor each.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{takes an}} {{interest}} in the Reading Digest magazine after a copy is sent to the Simpson family's residence. In the magazine, he notices <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>for</b> a children's contest in which an essay must be written about what makes America great. Lisa chooses to enter, takes a trip to Springfield Forest, and is inspired to write her essay when she sees the forest's natural beauty and when an eagle lands right by the branch she is sitting under. Lisa's article is approved for entry in the national finals in Washington, D.C. after the contest judge observes Homer's poor vocabulary and realizes that he could not have written Lisa's essay for her.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Nolan Bushnell saw Spacewar {{running on a}} {{mainframe}} at the University of Utah {{where he was a}} student. Bushnell worked during the summer at Lagoon Amusement Park in Utah as a manager of the games department overseeing the arcade games, and when he saw Spacewar he believed that an arcade game version of the game would be very popular. The high price of computers capable of running the game, however, meant that any such arcade game would not be economically feasible. After graduating from college Bushnell worked as an engineer in California for Ampex, an electronics company that worked in audio and video recording technology. He also met researcher Jim Stein, who worked for Stanford University's Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project; he learned from him that Spacewar was running on the laboratory's PDP-6, and played the game against him there when visiting. Soon after, he saw <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>for</b> the Data General Nova computer, which cost only US$4,000, and thought again about his Spacewar arcade game idea; he believed that at that price, if he were able to connect four monitors and coin slots to allow multiple games to run simultaneously, the game would be economically viable. He showed his office mate and fellow Ampex engineer Ted Dabney Spacewar at the Stanford laboratory, and the two agreed to work together to try and design a prototype of the game; Bushnell was more experienced with computers and digital engineering, while Dabney was more experienced with analog and hardware engineering, as he had been working on designing video processing and control circuits and power supplies.|$|E

500|$|Amy {{has become}} a minor celebrity, {{appearing}} in <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>for</b> Petrichor perfume, with the tagline, [...] "For the girl who's tired of waiting." [...] The concept of petrichor {{was used as a}} psychic password in [...] "The Doctor's Wife" [...] and means [...] "the smell of dust after rain". The Doctor frequently refers to Amy as [...] "the girl who waited". The perfume and tagline imply that the episode takes place after [...] "The God Complex". This conflicts with the date on Craig's newspaper, 19 April 2011, which is three days before the Doctor's death at Lake Silencio.|$|E
500|$|In April 2008 {{a picture}} of Song was used in <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>for</b> an escort agency in the LA Weekly.

[...] The settlement was announced in March 2009.|$|E

He also praised all of the character pairings that the action-heavy episode managed to explore, and positively compared the overall episode to [...] "a kind of thinking person’s G.I. Joe ... it’s satisfying to see [...] original lineup on one more Joe-like mission." ...|$|E

He found that high self-esteem participants liked products more if the product names were self-relevant than if they were not. He also found the opposite happened among low self-esteem participants: they liked products better if they were not self-relevant.|$|E
500|$|Chicago {{businessman}} Michael Butler {{was planning}} {{to run for the}} U.S. Senate on an anti-war platform.

[...] Papp and Butler first moved the show to The Cheetah, a discothèque at 53rd Street and Broadway. [...] It opened there on December 22, 1967 and ran for 45 performances. [...] There was no nudity in either the Public Theater or Cheetah production.|$|E
500|$|It {{is common}} for shuttle trains to display {{advertising}} that entirely covers the interiors and exteriors of the train, as opposed to other routes, whose stock only displays advertising on placards inside the train. Since 2008, the MTA has tested full-train advertisements on 42nd Street Shuttle rolling stock. While most advertisements are well received, a few advertisements have been controversial. Among the more contentious wraps that were withdrawn are a 2015 ad for the TV show The Man in the High Castle, which featured a Nazi flag, and <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>for</b> the [...] "hopeless" [...] Knicks, in which a shuttle train and half of its seats were plastered with negative quotes about the city's NBA team.|$|E
