5|$|Female {{homosexual}} {{behavior may}} be present in every culture, although {{the concept of a}} lesbian <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> pairs exclusively with other women is not. Attitudes about female homosexual behavior are dependent upon women's roles in each society, and each culture's definition of sex. Women in the Middle East have been historically segregated from men. In the 7th and 8th centuries, some extraordinary women dressed in male attire when gender roles were less strict, but the sexual roles that accompanied European women were not associated with Islamic women. The Caliphal court in Baghdad featured women who dressed as men, including false facial hair, but they competed with other women for the attentions of men.|$|E

5|$|Zenobia has {{inspired}} scholars, academics, musicians and actors; her fame has {{lingered in the}} West, and is supreme in the Middle East. As a heroic queen with a tragic end, she stands alongside Cleopatra and Boudica. The queen's legend turned her into an idol, that can be reinterpreted to accommodate the needs of writers and historians; thus, Zenobia has been by turns a freedom fighter, a hero of the oppressed and a national symbol. The queen is a female role model; according to historian Michael Rostovtzeff, Catherine the Great liked to compare herself to Zenobia <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> created military might and an intellectual court. During the 1930s, thanks to an Egyptian-based feminist press, Zenobia became an icon for women's-magazine readers in the Arabic-speaking world as a strong, nationalistic female leader.|$|E

She traveled to Kenya to film Mister Moses (1965), where publicized rumors spread that she and co-star Robert Mitchum were having an affair, which they both vehemently denied.

She subsequently appeared with Maasai warriors on the cover of Lifes July 1964 issue.|$|E

Many of Kahlo's paintings are concerned with medical imagery, which is presented in terms of pain and hurt, featuring Kahlo bleeding and displaying her open wounds.

25|$|Their {{latest book}} to date, The Body Shape Bible, was {{published}} on 18 September 2007. Prior to writing The Body Shape Bible, Trinny and Susannah {{conducted a survey}} on women that helped them to identify the twelve most common body shapes which they would then feature in their fashion advice book. They gave the shapes different names that include 'apple', 'brick', 'pencil' and 'lollipop'. The new book is aimed to help women decipher what particular shape they are, and then proceeds to give fashion guidelines according to each individual shape. An 'apple' for instance, is classed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> is round but has breasts that are smaller than her stomach as the weight is carried around the middle. They have also donated a few pages to highlight their own fashion faux-pas from the past.|$|E
