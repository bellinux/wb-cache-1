Competitors are given 60 cm stalks of the plant, from which they strip the leaves and eat them. Whoever strips and eats the most stinging nettle leaves in a fixed time is the winner. The competition dates back to 1986, when two neighbouring farmers attempted to settle a dispute about which had the worst infestation of nettles.|$|R
5000|$|The Bottle Inn {{hosts the}} <b>annual</b> World <b>Nettle</b> Eating Championships {{as part of}} a charity beer festival. Competitors are served 2 ft long stalks of {{stinging}} nettles from which they pluck and eat the leaves. After an hour the bare stalks are measured and the winner is the competitor with the greatest accumulated length of nettles. The contest began in the late 1980s when two farmers argued over who had the longest stinging nettles in their field and evolved into the World Nettle Eating Championships when one of the farmers promised to eat any nettle which was longer than his. The championship has separate men’s and women’s sections and attracts competitors from as far afield as Canada and Australia.|$|R
5000|$|The Dorset Knob is a hard, dry, savoury biscuit {{peculiar}} to the county. They are typically eaten with cheese such as Dorset Blue Vinney and {{are said to}} have been a favourite food of local author Thomas Hardy. A Dorset Knob throwing competition is held in the Dorset village of Cattistock every year on the first Sunday in May. [...] The festival also includes such events as a knob and spoon race, knob darts, knob painting and guess the weight of the knob. Dorset Blue Vinney is a hard, crumbly cheese with a strong taste and smell. It is made with unpasturised, skimmed milk. Historically the cream was removed to make butter which was highly regarded in London and carried a premium price. William Barnes asks for Blue Vinney cheese in his poem, 'Praise O' Do'set'. Since 1986 an <b>annual</b> <b>nettle</b> eating competition has been held in the village of Marshwood. It attracts nettle eaters from across the globe.|$|E
