5|$|HISD paid around $200,000 USD {{to lease}} the Las <b>Américas</b> units. In October 2006, Michael Marquez, {{president}} of the Hispanic Housing and Education Corporation, which operated Las <b>Américas,</b> announced to HISD in a letter that the organization would terminate the lease agreement because of issues related to maintenance and management. The district decided to vacate the property instead of appealing the decision. In summer 2007, the former Las <b>Américas</b> Education Center closed. The early childhood center merged with Mistral and the middle schools moved to the Long Middle School campus.|$|E
5|$|In his 1935 book, The Three <b>Americas,</b> Widney {{said that}} Atlantis {{was in the}} area where the Bahamas are located. He thought it was a semi-tropical island, {{inhabited}} by peoples from the <b>Americas</b> rather than from Europe. He also believed that there was a submerged lost continent in the South Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Many {{new plant}} {{medicines}} arrived in Europe as products of Early Modern exploration {{and the resulting}} Columbian Exchange, in which livestock, crops and technologies were transferred between the Old World and the <b>Americas</b> in the 15th and 16th centuries. Medicinal herbs arriving in the <b>Americas</b> included garlic, ginger, and turmeric; coffee, tobacco and coca travelled in the other direction.|$|E
5|$|Native American {{populations were}} devastated by {{contagious}} diseases, in particular, smallpox, {{brought to the}} <b>Americas</b> by European colonists. It is unclear how many Native Americans were killed by foreign diseases after the arrival of Columbus in the <b>Americas,</b> but the numbers have been estimated {{to be close to}} 70% of the indigenous population. The damage done by this disease significantly aided European attempts to displace and conquer the native population.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-Venezuelan {{boundary}} dispute asserted {{for the first}} time a more outward-looking American foreign policy, particularly in the <b>Americas,</b> marking the United States as a world power.

5|$|A single soldier {{arriving}} in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and thus initiated the devastating plagues that {{swept through the}} native populations of the <b>Americas.</b> The European diseases that ravaged the indigenous inhabitants of the <b>Americas</b> also severely affected the various Maya groups of Petén. It is estimated that there were approximately 30,000 Ch'ol and Ch’olti’ Maya in western Petén {{at the start of}} the 16th century. Between 1559 and 1721 they were devastated by a combination of disease, war and enforced relocations.|$|E

5|$|Americium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Am and atomic number 95. It is a transuranic {{member of the}} actinide series, in the periodic table located under the lanthanide element europium, and thus by analogy was named after the <b>Americas.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{major change}} was {{the arrival of}} foods from the <b>Americas</b> in Early Modern times (around the sixteenth century), notably the {{incorporation}} of the potato into Northern European cuisine, and the eager adoption of the tomato into Mediterranean cuisine. The tomato, so central now to that cuisine, was first described in print by Pietro Andrea Mattioli in 1544. Similarly, many of the species of Phaseolus beans now used around the Mediterranean, including P. vulgaris (the French or haricot bean), were brought back from the <b>Americas</b> by Spanish and Portuguese explorers.|$|E

5|$|Folk {{music in}} the US is varied across the country's {{numerous}} ethnic groups. The Native American tribes each play their own varieties of folk music, most of it spiritual in nature. African American music includes blues and gospel, descendants of West African music brought to the <b>Americas</b> by slaves and mixed with Western European music. During the colonial era, English, French and Spanish styles and instruments {{were brought to the}} <b>Americas.</b> By the early 20th century, the United States had become a major center for folk music from around the world, including polka, Ukrainian and Polish fiddling, Ashkenazi, klezmer, and several kinds of Latin music.|$|E

5|$|In 2003 and 2007, the {{qualifying}} format {{allowed for}} {{eight of the}} twenty available positions to be filled by automatic qualification, as the eight quarter finalists of the previous tournament enter its successor. The remaining twelve positions were filled by continental qualifying tournaments. Positions were filled by three teams from the <b>Americas,</b> one from Asia, one from Africa, three from Europe and two from Oceania. Another two places were allocated for repechage. The first repechage place was determined by a match between the runners-up from the Africa and Europe qualifying tournaments, with that winner then playing the <b>Americas</b> runner-up to determine the place. The second repechage position was determined between the runners-up from the Asia and Oceania qualifiers.|$|E

5|$|Maya art is {{essentially}} {{the art of the}} royal court. It is almost exclusively concerned with the Maya elite and their world.

The finest surviving Maya art dates to the Late Classic period.|$|E
