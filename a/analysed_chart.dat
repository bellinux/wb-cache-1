In 2010, Dr. Galen Burghardt, adjunct professor at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, found a correlation of 0.97 between a subset of trend following CTAs and a broader CTA index from the period 2000-2009, indicating that speculative technical trend following had been dominant within the CTA community.

Other non-trend following CTAs include short-term traders, spread trading and individual market specialists. [...] Fundamental CTA's typically invest based on analysis of the core markets they are trading, by analysing weather patterns, farm yields, understanding oil drilling volumes etc. Quantitative CTA's do statistical or quantitative analysis on market price patterns and try to make predictions based on such research.

An {{analysis of the}} ideas of the international debate about Chávez socialistic politic Since more than 2000 years there has been an ongoing discussion about whether state interference is a good thing or not. Most international organisations on the international political arena are today founded on neoliberal values, and it has developed in to the hegemonic ideology of the world. The socialistic politics of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez is thereby a somewhat unusual strategy. The purpose of this essay is to examine to what extent the international debate about Chávez socialistic politic can be understood through a neoliberal perspective.

The objectives of this study were to describe the healthcare cost for outpatient diabetes mellitus treatment and to examine the cost of different classes of antidiabetic drug. The medical records of Type 2 diabetes mellitus outpatients without compelling indication were retrospectively reviewed. Data was collected for patients treated from January 1 st to December 31 st, 2004 in Kodya Yogyakarta Hospital. Data collected includedpatient demographics, drug acquisition cost, medical consultation cost and laboratory cost. We <b>analysed</b> <b>charts</b> of 100 consecutive patients, of whom 71 % are women and 29 % are men. The average age ofpatient was 61. 2 ± 13. 7 years. The monthly mean cost of Type 2 diabetes mellitus was found to be equivalent to USD 19. 97 ± 13. 71. Most of the direct medical costs were spent on drugs (96. 4 %). Bloodglucose control using combination therapy was more frequently attained in patients taking glibenclamide and metformin (25 %). The combination of gliquidone-metformin-acarbose (21 %) was themost expensive, which was equivalent to USD 39. 44.

This study's objectives were, in chronically deficient ACL patients, to assess onset delay for developing chondral patella lesions and also analyse these lesions characteristics in relation to laxity duration. HYPOTHESIS: Chondral patellar lesions in ACL deficient knees get worse with time. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed 250 charts of patients who had undergone arthroscopically assisted surgery for knee anterior laxity. The arthroscopic procedures were conducted between January 1995 and January 2005. Chondral damages were evaluated at surgery according both to International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) and Bauer and Jackson classifications. The data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Of the 250 <b>analysed</b> <b>charts,</b> 72 patients (28. 8 %) were found to present chondral patella lesions. The majority of these lesions were superficial and involved the lateral facet area. We observed a statistically significant ICRS worsening grade in relation to laxity duration. DISCUSSION: Few publications in the literature report patellar involvement in anterior laxity of the knee. However, our results are comparable to those of the rare series found. The pathomechanics of these lesions has not yet been precisely identified and requires further biomechanical studies. CONCLUSION: Patellar damage is frequent with anterior laxity (28. 8 % in our series) and duration is correlated with statistically significant aggravation of these lesions. Currently, the assessment of these patellar lesions is considered less important than meniscal and femorotibial lesions, even though the natural history of ACL disruption seems to be evolving toward degeneration of all the compartments of the knee, including the femoropatellar compartment...|$|R

Specific Aim # 2 : Describe the frequency of cardiac safety monitoring for patients undergoing treatment with pertuzumab containing regimens for HER 2 + BC within these case studies, retrospective <b>chart</b> <b>analyses,</b> and prospective randomized clinical trials. Methods: Case reports, retrospective <b>chart</b> <b>analyses,</b> and prospective, randomized, controlled trials were identified by search of PubMed and Embase databases, {{as well as through}} the Google Scholar search engine. The search strategy included the following keywords: epidermal growth factor receptor 2, erbB- 2 genes, pertuzumab, cardiotoxicity, left ventricular function, and left ventricular dysfunction. Reviews were ineligible. All studies that examined the cardiac safety of pertuzumab containing regimens for chemotherapy-naïve HER 2 + locally advanced, inflammatory, early stage, or metastatic breast cancer were considered eligible for this systematic review, regardless of sample size. Results: So far, the search strategy retrieved 3 studies that evaluated the cardiac toxicity outcomes of pertuzumab containing regimens. All studies were conducted for chemotherapy-naïve HER 2 + locally advanced, inflammatory, early stage, or metastatic breast cancer. Conclusions: The incidence of cardiotoxicity due to treatment with pertuzumab containing regimens for chemotherapy-naïve HER 2 + locally advanced, inflammatory, early stage, or metastatic breast cancer remains relatively low. However, the potential severity of cardiac effects related to pertuzumab containing regimens is an important consideration when using these regimens in patients who have any existing risk factors for decreased cardiac function.

The system starts by determining the shape parameters of the chart (location of the centre and radius). The position of the start of the 24 -hour period (radius from centre to 24 hour tick mark) is then estimated.
