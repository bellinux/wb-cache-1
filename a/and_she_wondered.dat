25|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, Evans became {{addicted}} to cocaine. He started with one gram per weekend, but later started taking several grams daily. His friends, Chicago pianists Sam Distefano and Larry Novak, repeatedly tried lecturing {{him in an}} effort to get him to quit, fearing for Bill's health. His brother Harry's suicide may have also influenced his emotional state after 1979. His sister-in-law Pat Evans has stated that she knew Bill wouldn't last long after Harry's death <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> if that's what prompted her to buy three plots in a Baton Rouge Cemetery, where Harry was interred. It has been documented that he voluntarily quit his treatment for chronic hepatitis. Laurie Verchomin has claimed that Evans was clear in mind that he would die in a short time.|$|E
500|$|Throughout filming, Hitchcock {{created and}} hid various {{versions}} of the [...] "Mother corpse" [...] prop in Leigh's dressing room closet. Leigh took the joke well, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> whether it was done to keep her on edge and thus more in character or to judge which corpse would be scarier for the audience.|$|E
2500|$|The local borough {{pledged to}} carry out a full {{investigation}} into the fire. Prime Minister Theresa May ordered a full public inquiry, saying that people [...] "deserve answers" [...] to why the fire was able to spread as quickly as it did. Sophie Khan, who acted as solicitor for some families in the Lakanal House fire, told BBC Two's Newsnight that inquests would be better for the families as they would allow the families to participate and ask questions. She said the coroner was independent but a public inquiry was government-led <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> what information the Prime Minister knew that she wanted to hide.|$|E
5000|$|Sugar is a possum {{who plays}} the Bongo drums with Jasper and other possums. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> if Jasper is ever wearing sandals or not. She married Brush in [...] "Possumbillities".|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{she writes}} {{a note saying}} that all {{children}} copy, if they can, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> that I should be so severe upon such a frequent occurrence, which reflects more discredit on the governesses than the scholars.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Learning {{the task}} was a tall order but Yuchen never gave up, staying back after work hours to master her skills, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> if her {{perseverance}} {{was a result of}} her love for coffee or something elseâ€¦ ...|$|R
60|$|Alison had not {{expected}} this, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> with some resentment exactly what he meant to imply.|$|E
60|$|The {{afternoon}} Valentia {{spent in}} her room, pretending to write letters, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> whether Ferdinand was wishing her downstairs.|$|E
60|$|Laura's grounds {{were good}} <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> whether Stannard knew. Her father was clever {{and she saw}} his look was thoughtful.|$|E
50|$|Eventually {{she finds}} the money he was given <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> how he got it. He then reluctantly {{explains}} how, trying to explain that he took it unwillingly. She doesn't believe him and ends up getting in the truck and driving off without him.|$|R
50|$|In his apartment, Wesley has a {{dream about}} Fred. When he wakes up, Illyria is with him. They both confess {{they do not}} like the world <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> why he is still in it. Lindsey could give them more information, but the Senior Partners imprisoned him.|$|R
50|$|Kathryn C. DeVito, of Pop Matters, {{said that}} the book has vivid and {{intimate}} portrayals remind us that these women are human beings first, inmates second <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> why Wally Lamb's name is in bold print on the cover since he did not write the book.|$|R
60|$|And {{she said}} it truthfully. Her {{conscience}} smote her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> bitterly what she had left undone that might have averted this calamity.|$|E
60|$|She {{thought it}} {{must be one of}} the young men, perhaps, with the poles for the carrying-chair; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> vaguely why he had come so early.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Austin was surprised, {{but said}} nothing. Kit had not {{talked to her}} like this before. He was cool and very stern. Somehow he looked older <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> about the bruise.|$|E
6000|$|A shiver {{passed through}} Renouard. <b>She</b> had <b>wondered!</b> What about? Malata was himself. He and Malata were one. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> had <b>wondered!</b> <b>She</b> had [...] .|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>and</b> Fiorenze, who {{actually}} hates her fairy, join forces, with Charlie discovering that Fiorenze {{is not a}} bad person, and they hatch a plan to switch their fairies, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> learns to be careful about what <b>she</b> wishes for <b>and</b> how the grass is always greener. With the every-boy-will-like-you fairy, girls turn on Charlie, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> whether Steffi likes her or if he is just responding to her fairy.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> blinked <b>and</b> gasped, <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>and</b> despaired. [...] "Oh no, {{it will be}} YOU. I've {{had nothing}} to do with it. Everything's all you!" ...|$|R
60|$|But Mary Erskine did not answer. Mary Bell {{could hear}} the sound of the spinning-wheel in the house, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> why the spinner could not hear her, when she called so loud.|$|E
60|$|Louise {{thought of}} the {{smouldering}} eyes of that woman, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> if they were what suggested something very impassioned to Maxwell; {{but with all the}} frankness between them, she did not ask him.|$|E
6000|$|Eugenia stared--that is, she smiled; {{she thought}} of her poor little chalet <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> whether her hostess were jesting. [...] "Yes, my house is exquisite," [...] she said; [...] "though not to be {{compared}} to yours." ...|$|E
60|$|She did not rebuke him, <b>and</b> Peggy--though <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> at his tone--was too {{grateful}} for his presence even to question Alice's motive in permitting such remarks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said Cornelia, <b>and</b> while <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> how <b>she</b> {{could make}} this opening of assent turn to refusal in the end, Ludlow went on: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> then <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> {{that this}} should be so, seeing that she had still {{regarded}} Clara as being in all things a child; <b>and</b> as <b>she</b> thought further, <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> at her own fatuity, in that she had allowed herself to be so grossly deceived.|$|R
60|$|Katharine laughed. She {{looked at}} Ralph. His eyes were meditative, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> {{what he found}} in this old gossip to make him ponder so contentedly. She felt, she hardly knew why, a curious pity for him.|$|E
6000|$|He made no answer, but {{his look}} of {{disappointment}} excited her to observe to {{herself that she}} supposed he expected her to run all over the town without ordering dinner first, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> how he would like that! ...|$|E
60|$|She {{saw that}} his boots were all clayey, even his {{trousers}} were plastered with clay. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> if he had made footprints all the way up. He was a very strange figure, standing in her bedroom, near the tossed bed.|$|E
60|$|And Charmian {{looked at}} me, <b>and</b> I knew <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> where I had got it.|$|R
50|$|Aaron {{wants to}} help Elena find Wes <b>and</b> <b>she</b> takes her to the Whitmore house, where he reveals that his last name is Whitmore and he is {{basically}} also owner of the college. Elena sees {{a picture of her}} dad along with others in the house <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> about it. Wes appears <b>and</b> <b>she</b> tells her that her father was member of the Augustine community and while they are talking, he injects her with vervain. He locks her up to the cell next to Damon's where she wakes up confused.|$|R
40|$|A GIRL hears a bugle at Iowa State, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> at {{the strange}} sound. She studies her home economics, and the campus is green, and a uniform is {{something}} she sees {{going into a}} movie downtown. <b>And</b> then <b>she</b> reads in her newspaper that her country is at war, <b>and</b> before <b>she</b> is accustomed to war, with its pleadings that she give her money and accept less food, she hears a strange sound: a bugle, whining over her campus where only the bells were heard before [...] ...|$|R
60|$|Barbara Harding, {{still looking}} questioningly at him, saw {{the change that}} came across his countenance--she saw the swift pain that shot to the man's eyes, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wondered.</b> His fingers {{released}} their grasp upon her arm. His hands fell limply to his sides.|$|E
60|$|When she was {{indoors and}} alone Mrs. Harnham thought what a well-bred and chivalrous young man Anna's {{companion}} had seemed. There {{had been a}} magic in his wooing touch of her hand; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> how {{he had come to}} be attracted by the girl.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Drane {{was not the}} liveliest {{person at}} the dinner table, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> much how Ralph and Cicely, who had been so {{extremely}} sober at breakfast time, should now be so hilarious. The arrival of Miriam seemed hardly reason enough for such intemperate gayety.|$|E
50|$|Following him around, Alice is {{impressed}} by Joe's work ethic <b>and</b> personality. <b>She</b> <b>wonders</b> if veteran politician Charles Birch is a corrupting influence, {{only to learn}} that Birch has been a mentor to Joe and is greatly admired.|$|R
60|$|When Jane awoke, {{she did not}} {{at first}} recall the strange events of the {{preceding}} day, <b>and</b> so <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> at her odd surroundings--the little leafy bower, the soft grasses of her bed, the unfamiliar prospect from the opening at her feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] she said, {{this time}} with an accent of comprehension, though {{secretly}} his speech had been so much Greek to her <b>and</b> <b>she</b> was <b>wondering</b> what a lift was and what swatted meant.|$|R
