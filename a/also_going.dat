5|$|At {{the first}} {{race of the}} season in Melbourne, Webber {{qualified}} in 7th place and held that position for {{the early part of the}} race, managing to finish in 13th position after the RB3 suffered from a throttle-related malfunction and a jammed fuel flap. At the , he again out-qualified his more experienced teammate Coulthard and finished tenth, which was encouraging for the team in such a new and radical car. Bahrain was <b>also</b> <b>going</b> well for both drivers, who were running in sixth and seventh positions, until both cars retired due to mechanical malfunctions. Webber again was hampered by the aforementioned jammed fuel flap, radically affecting the aerodynamic drag, a vital set-up consideration for the Sakhir circuit.|$|E
5|$|In making {{preparations}} for filming, the producers {{found that the}} cost of production in the New York City area would be prohibitive and it was <b>also</b> <b>going</b> to be difficult to find locations that resembled early 1950s New York. Part of the financing plan was hinging on a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led to a complete re-think. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, she found that it had not changed much in decades and the state of Ohio also had one of the best film tax incentives in the United States. The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many local citizens as crew.|$|E

5|$|The first EC-137 {{made its}} maiden flight on 9 February 1972, with the fly-off {{between the two}} radars taking place during March–July that year. Favorable test results led to the {{selection}} of Westinghouse's radar for the production aircraft. Hughes's radar was initially {{thought to be a}} certain winner, simply because much of its design was <b>also</b> <b>going</b> into the new F-15 Eagle's radar program. The Westinghouse radar used a pipelined fast fourier transform (FFT) to digitally resolve 128 Doppler frequencies, while Hughes's radars used analog filters based on the design for the F-15 fighter. Westinghouse's engineering team won this competition by using a programmable 18-bit computer whose software could be modified before each mission. This computer was the AN/AYK-8 design from the B-57G program, and designated AYK-8-EP1 for its much expanded memory. This radar also multiplexed a beyond-the-horizon (BTH) pulse mode that could complement the pulse-Doppler radar mode. This proved to be beneficial especially when the BTH mode is used to detect ships at sea when the radar beam is directed below the horizon.|$|E
5|$|After Auburn's kickoff, Virginia Tech {{started its}} first drive {{of the second}} half at its 20-yard line. Down by 16 points, Tech needed to score. The Hokies gained a quick first down, but a five-yard penalty and a sack of Bryan Randall {{prevented}} Tech from gaining another. The Hokies were forced to punt, and Auburn took over at its 44-yard line. Despite having good field position, the Tigers went three and out. Following the punt, Virginia Tech reciprocated by <b>also</b> <b>going</b> three and out. With 3:47 remaining in the quarter, Auburn began an offensive drive from its 35-yard line. From the beginning of the drive, however, the Tigers had problems. The first play of Auburn's drive was a 10-yard penalty against the Tigers. The second resulted in a one-yard loss by Ronnie Brown, who attempted to rush through the middle of the defensive line. On the third play, Virginia Tech cornerback Jimmy Williams intercepted an errant pass by Jason Campbell. Though Williams was unable to advance the ball, the Hokies still took over on offense, and with 2:38 remaining in the quarter, had their best field position since the first half.|$|E

5|$|The {{second half}} of play began with Virginia Tech {{receiving}} the ball, going three and out, and punting the ball back to Louisville. The Cardinals reciprocated by <b>also</b> <b>going</b> three and out and punting the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies began their second drive of the quarter at their one-yard line. Despite beginning deep in their own end of the field, Virginia Tech mounted a successful drive. Tailback Branden Ore and quarterback Marcus Vick alternated rushes, picking up 18yards and a first down. After Vick was sacked by the Louisville defense, he recovered by throwing a 29-yard pass for another first down. Following the pass, Vick and Ore rushed for six consecutive plays, alternating carries at various intervals. Inside the Louisville red zone, however, the Cardinals' defense stiffened and the Tech offense began to falter. After Tech successfully gained a first down on fourth and one, the Hokies were unable to gain another. Tech kicker Brandon Pace was forced to make his second field goal of the game, this one a 28-yarder, to make the game 17–13 with 2:52 remaining in the quarter. The Tech drive began with 11:17 remaining in the quarter and took eight minutes and 25seconds off the clock.|$|E
5|$|Worms Armageddon was {{originally}} intended to be an expansion pack to Worms 2, but it was eventually developed as a standalone game. It {{was intended to be}} the last game of the Worms franchise, but Andy Davidson, the creator of Worms, felt that it needed more content before being released, leading to the development of Worms World Party. It was <b>also</b> <b>going</b> to be released under the name Wormageddon, but Team17 changed the name to Worms Armageddon because of close similarities to {{the name of the game}} Carmageddon. It was released initially for PCs in 1999 in Europe and on 31 May 1999 in North America and has since been ported to Dreamcast and PlayStation on 30 November 1999, Game Boy Color on 19 January 2000, and Nintendo 64 on 30 March 2000. The Nintendo 64 version is one of the first Nintendo 64 games to feature a terrain editor and generator. A Macintosh version was being developed by MacSoft, but it has since been cancelled. Worms Armageddon was produced by Martyn Brown and composed by Bjørn Lynne, Karl Morton was the game's lead programmer, and Dan Cartwright was the game's lead artist.|$|E
