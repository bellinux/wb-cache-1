60|$|Is it {{possible}} to effect a fundamental reform of the existing economic system by any other method than that of Bolshevism? The difficulty of answering this question is what chiefly attracts idealists to the dictatorship of the proletariat. If, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>argued,</b> the method of violent revolution and Communist rule {{is not likely to}} have the results which idealists desire, we are reduced to despair unless we call see hope in other methods. The Bolshevik arguments against all other methods are powerful. I confess that, when the spectacle of present-day Russia forced me to disbelieve in Bolshevik methods, I was at first unable to see any way of curing the essential evils of capitalism. My first impulse was to abandon political thinking as a bad job, and to conclude that the strong and ruthless must always exploit the weaker and kindlier sections of the population. But this is not an attitude that can be long maintained by any vigorous and temperamentally hopeful person. Of course, if it were the truth, one would have to acquiesce. Some people believe that by living on sour milk one can achieve immortality. Such optimists are answered by a mere refutation; {{it is not necessary to}} go on and point out some other way of escaping death. Similarly an argument that Bolshevism will not lead to the millennium would remain valid even if it could be shown that the millennium cannot be reached by any other road. But the truth in social questions is not quite like truth in physiology or physics, since it depends upon men's beliefs. Optimism tends to verify itself by making people impatient of avoidable evils; while despair, on the other hand, makes the world as bad as it believes it to be. It is therefore imperative for those who do not believe in Bolshevism to put some other hope in its place.|$|E

The Crusader would have been quite justified in suspecting the Moslem even if the Moslem had merely been a new stranger; but as a matter of history he was already an old enemy. The critic of the Crusade talks as if it had sought out some inoffensive tribe or temple in the interior of Thibet, which was never discovered until it was invaded. They seem entirely to forget that long before the Crusaders had dreamed of riding to Jerusalem, the Moslems had almost ridden into Paris. They seem to forget that if the Crusaders nearly conquered Palestine, it was but a return upon the Moslems who had nearly conquered Europe. There was no need for them to argue by an appeal to reason, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> above, that a religious division must make a difference; it had already made a difference. The difference stared them in the face in the startling transformation of Roman Barbary and of Roman Spain. In short it was something which must happen in theory and which did happen in practice; all expectation suggested that it would be so and all experience said it was so. Having thought it out theoretically and experienced it practically, they proceeded to deal with it equally practically. The first division involved every principle of the science of thought; and the last developments followed out every principle of the science of war. The Crusade was the counter-attack. It was the defensive army taking the offensive in its turn, and driving back the enemy to his base. And it is this process, reasonable from its first axiom to its last act, that Mr. Pound actually selects as a sort of automatic wandering of an animal. But a man so intelligent would not have made a mistake so extraordinary but for another error which it is here very essential to consider. To suggest that men engaged, rightly or wrongly, in so logical a military and political operation were only migrating like birds or swarming like bees is as ridiculous as to say that the Prohibition campaign in America was only an animal reversion towards lapping as the dog lappeth, or Rowland Hill's introduction of postage stamps an animal taste for licking as the cat licks. Why should we provide other people with a remote reason for their own actions, when they themselves are ready to tell us the reason, and it is a perfectly reasonable reason? ...|$|E

50|$|With these {{considerations}} in mind, consider the parallel which, {{as it seems}} to me, is presented though with certain differences by Moral Philosophy. The sense that we ought to do certain things arises in our unreflective consciousness, being an activity of moral thinking occasioned by the various situations in which we find ourselves. At this stage our attitude to these obligations is one of unquestioning confidence. But inevitably the appreciation {{of the degree to which}} the execution of these obligations is contrary to our interest raises the doubt whether after all these obligations are, really obligatory, i.e., whether our sense that we ought not to do certain things is not illusion.

This demand IS, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>argued,</b> illegitimate. Hence in the first place, if, as is almost universally the case, by Moral Philosophy is meant the knowledge which would satisfy this demand, there is no such knowledge, and all attempts to attain it are doomed to failure because they rest on a mistake, the mistake of supposing the possibility of proving what can only be apprehended directly by an act of moral thinking.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: For over {{a decade}} several workers <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> for the {{existence}} of quantum deviations from the classical, Einstein dilation of the decay evolution of moving or Lorentz boosted unstable particles. While the general claim is correct, the discussions have been incomplete and, sometimes, misleading. The discussions have been of three kinds. Type 1 examines the time dependence of the survival probability for 3 -momentum eigenstates of the unstable quanton (Khalfin). Type 2 does the same for velocity eigenstates, obtaining an outrageous result which then discredits velocity eigenstates (Shirokov / Hegerfeldt). Type 3 examines arbitrary boosts of 3 -momentum eigenstates (Stefanovich). Type 1 is incomplete since the momentum eigenstates are not the boosts of one another. Type 2 is misleading since the outrageous result is due to misinterpreting the initial conditions of the velocity eigenstates (<b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> previously <b>argued).</b> Type 3 is the most satisfactory, but has failed to recognize and implement the unification of all three types of discussion that can be achieved. In this paper I will provide that unified treatment, beginning with a recapitulation of Type 1 and offering further clarification of Type 2 in the process. The unified treatment fully reinstates velocity eigenstates as essential contributors to unstable quanton states. Besides discussing the time evolution of survival probabilities I also focus on the concept of lifetime defined as the average time of decay. This quantity is helpful in order to display the inequivalent dependence of dilation on momentum and boosts most sharply and the deviation from Einstein dilation most cleanly...|$|R
40|$|The Subprime Crash {{that started}} capitalism’s latest crisis was mainly {{a proxy for}} an {{inexistent}} housing policy which would benefit many impoverished middle class families.

More than that, it could also be the demonstration of the counterproductive effects of the neglect of human rights by the market and by economics itself, the crisis being a result of this neglect. Human rights are assuredly {{one of the most influential}} and fruitful concepts of modern times in the human quest for dignity. Economics has developed a considerable amount of tools especially designed to overcome, or at least mitigate, scarcity, probably the most tormenting spectre that haunts the deprived.

30|$|My {{concern that}} MC {{has only been}} thought to target non-nationals is also not denied by the contributors, neither have they denied that the IC policy scope is broader as it also {{includes}} nationals. In fact, this mainstreaming nature of IC reinforces its intersectional and inter-public spaces dimensions. At this point multiculturalists need {{to be honest with}} themselves: MC was never thought as a policy to be relatable for citizens and nationals, but it was though out for those that have been interpreted as being “worst-off” in our society for legal, political, social and cultural reasons. The normative concern for justice in diverse societies impregnates this rawlsian interpretation of diversity in the original MC policy project. It is not surprising that the first multiculturalists were academically socialized with the debate of a just society of the 80 s and the liberal/libertarian/communitarian debates that this generation aroused. We probably need a deeper exploration on how the theory of justice of the 80 s influenced the initial MC project, maybe following the path of Levrau’s contribution. MC has been driven by an assumed principle of compensation of those that are seen as “different” from the mainstream. The view of ‘different’ and ‘worst-off’ have also been assumed, and has taken, in its radical form, a goodness attitude that has not contributed to appease the criticisms of its detractors. Within these preconceptions (here we are again!), MC has built its unity/diversity, majority/minority theoretical frameworks, separating, rather than bridging the ‘us’ and ‘them’ population, and even constructing this assumed power relation narrative of “privileged majority”. In my view IC solves some of these epistemological MC restraints. IC and mainstreaming policy presents many elective affinities <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> recently <b>argued</b> elsewhere (Zapata-Barrero, 2018 a).|$|R

40|$|In this chapter, it is {{suggested}} that our epistemic access to metaphysical modality generally involves rationalist, a priori elements. However, these a priori elements are much more subtle than ‘traditional’ modal rationalism assumes. In fact, some might even question the ‘apriority’ of these elements, but I should stress that I consider a priori and a posteriori elements especially in our modal inquiry to be so deeply intertwined that {{it is not easy to}} tell them apart. Supposed metaphysically necessary identity statements involving natural kind terms are a good example: the fact that empirical input is crucial in establishing their necessity has clouded the role and content of the a priori input, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> previously <b>argued</b> (Tahko forthcoming). For instance, the supposed metaphysically necessary identity statement involving water and its microstructure can only be established with the help of a controversial a priori principle concerning the determination of chemical properties by microstructure. The Kripke-Putnam framework of modal epistemology fails precisely because it is unclear whether the required a priori element is present. My positive proposal builds on E. J. Lowe’s work. Lowe holds that our knowledge of metaphysical modality is based on our knowledge of essence. Lowe’s account strives to offer a uniform picture of modal epistemology: essence is the basis of all our modal knowledge. This is the basis of Lowe’s modal rationalism. I believe that Lowe’s proposal is on the right lines in the case of abstract objects, but I doubt that it can be successfully applied to the case of natural kinds. Accordingly, the case of natural kinds will be my main focus and I will suggest that modal rationalism, at least as it is traditionally understood, falls short of explaining modal knowledge concerning natural kinds. Yet, I think that Lowe has identified something of crucial importance for modal epistemology, namely the essentialist, a priori elements present in our modal inquiry. The upshot is that rather than moving all the way from modal rationalism to modal empiricism, a type of hybrid approach, ‘empirically-informed modal rationalism’, can be developed...|$|R
40|$|Summary: This thesis {{discusses}} which {{factors that}} {{have had an impact}} on the outcome of the new Russian Criminal Procedural Code that was signed in December 2001. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> in writing this dissertation drawn on the spiral model from "Power of Human Rights" (1999) by Risse, Ropp and Sikkink. This book argues that the state s attitude towards making tactical acknowledgements to the international human rights obligations does have a positive impact on the real norms behaviour within the state. In my study <b>I</b> <b>have</b> examined the thesis that the pressure from the international and national community is necessary for introducing improvements. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> tested whether the changes in the Russian Criminal Procedural Code were subjected to the so-called "boomerang effect", i. e. the pressure from different groups triggering further developments. The study has emphasised that the government structures have been more involved in the legal reform process than expected. In particular the judicial elite operating in the constitutional court and higher courts of Russia has been progressive in underlining the breaches of rule of law in Russia from the beginning of the 1990. Some prominent forces within the presidential administration and the Federal Duma also played an important role in finishing the legal reform. The Soviet past has made the decision-making process difficult since the institutions that have been dominant; such as the prosecution authority, did not want to loose their leading role in criminal procedure. Except from participation in some round tables, the national NGOs have not been invited to participate formally in the decision making process. However, their reports could have raised the awareness, but otherwise their influence has limited through shaming instead of dialogue. Instead, the pressure from below has been visible through overwhelming appeals from Russian citizens to the European Human Rights Court in Strasbourg. Except from the effective use of the mechanisms of Council of Europe, the pressure from the international community, as a whole has not been as persevering <b>as</b> expected. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that Risse, Ropp and Sikkink´s model is too little nuanced compare to the importance of the Russian authorities active involvement. However this could be explained by the fact that my study has been concentrated on a limited legal law reform while the spiral model should illustrate several aspects of the human rights developments within the states...|$|R

In particular, I would argue that through the incorporation of the human body Clark's 1959 - 1964 Bicho series is the first spatial performative strategy developed by Clark during the 1960 s and against which all her subsequent production needs to be read.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore, from a figurational perspective, 1) the {{similarities}} and differences between individuals who volunteer in a sporting environment and those that volunteer in other volunteering environments, and 2) the shared and distinct issues that might exist within each area of the voluntary sector. There is a reasonable amount of literature on volunteering generally, including some from a sociological perspective; however, there is much less available concerning volunteering in a sporting context. Furthermore, voluntary Sports Organisations are a substantial provider of services and opportunities for participation and central government include goals of increasing sport participation through them (Game Plan, 2002). The study was based in the county of Flintshire in North Wales. Using a combination of research approaches both questionnaires and interviews were used. The questionnaires aimed to produce demographic information about both sports and non-sports volunteers. For the most part, both groups of volunteers were above the age of 45 and well educated. Sports volunteers were more likely to be employed in full time roles. Non-sports volunteers were more likely to be female, where as sports volunteers were more likely to be male. Individuals from both groups were likely to undertake more than one role for their organisation. The purpose of conducting interviews was to provide a more in depth analysis of the views and perceptions of volunteers themselves, that is, what it is that they do and think about volunteering. For non-sports volunteers, their primary motivation was helping others, although when explored more closely, this was also aligned to the satisfaction gained from helping others often coupled with a number of other internal functions, such as, the socialising aspects and gaining a sense of purpose. For sports volunteers their motivation was very much aligned with their love of sport itself. This study found that for the sports volunteers interviewed, their voluntary activity was a way of them engaging with their sports. For some it was a necessary function in order to keep the club they played for going, for others it was a way of maintaining their connection with the sport. Non-sports volunteers made a proactive choice to volunteer where as, for the most part sports volunteers gradually became involved in the running of the organisation as a consequence of their membership. Both groups considered frustrations with their voluntary activity, for the most part non-sports volunteers discuss fund raising and bureaucracy. Sports volunteers frustrations were around a lack of commitment from others and difficulty in recruiting new members as well <b>as</b> funding. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that it is the networks of figurations in which individuals are involved that influences behaviour. These networks have both constraining and enabling elements that either support or limit volunteering behaviour. Further, these networks influence the types of activity one in which one engages. The conclusions from this study have implications for both the methodology and future research questions. What is clear is that there is much more research to be undertaken reflecting on volunteering in sport and from a sociological perspective...|$|R
40|$|Few {{terms in}} {{organisational}} studies inspire less agreement than leadership. It is a slippery concept and {{much that is}} written on the subject is confusing and contradictory. Early theories of leadership have, generally, reduced leadership behaviour to a concern for task balanced against {{a concern for the}} well-being of employees. This two-dimensional approach {{has proved to be a}} limited conceptualisation of leadership. In response, over the past thirty years, researchers have tried to highlight the less rationalistic, more intangible, aspects of leadership. However, there is still very little in leadership research that conveys a sense of the leader <b>as</b> a person. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>argued,</b> in this study, that the reason for this lies in the fact that most leadership research has been conducted along positivistic lines and, therefore, cannot take into account the values, feelings, morals and life experiences of the human beings being studied. Thus, for the human being to take centre-stage in leadership enquiry, a different research paradigm needs to be explored. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> chosen to use phenomenological enquiry as an avenue for examining how John Stoker, the leader of the Rhodes University Mathematics Education Project (RUMEP), experiences being a leader. This is because phenomenology, in both theory and practice, privileges the nature of the meanings that people construct in their lives and that guide their actions. In adopting such a methodology my research findings have examined a number of issues that are of interest to current leadership researchers, however they have also highlighted a number of concerns that have not been explored thoroughly in the leadership literature. These include the importance of the individual leader’s action, intention and will in shaping an organisation, the complex nature of a leader’s creativity within the organisation and possible differences between educational leaders and business leaders. In adopting a phenomenological perspective the eccentricity and fulness of an individual leader’s action is expressed through the research, however, the research also focusses on how the researcher translates and evolving philosophical understanding into sound methodology. Therefore, interwoven into the discussions on leadership there are reflections on how I applied phenomenological theory. The purpose of these reflections is to deliberate on the appropriateness of applying such a methodology to the eclectic field of leadership and to show how my own developing philosophical attitude has transformed into practice. ...|$|R
60|$|In one of {{his little}} socialist {{pamphlets}} he tells how he sat under an elm-tree and watched the starlings and thought of an old horse and an old labourer that had passed him by, and {{of the men and}} women he had seen in towns; and he wondered how all these had come to be as they were. He saw that the starlings were beautiful and merry and that men and the old horse they had subdued to their service were ugly and miserable, and yet the starlings, he thought, were of one kind whether there or in the south of England, and the ugly men and women were of one kind with those whose nobility and beauty had moved the ancient sculptors and poets to imagine the gods and the heroes after the images of men. Then he began, he tells us, to meditate how this great difference might be ended and a new life, which would permit men to have beauty in common among them as the starlings have, be built on the wrecks of the old life. In other words, his mind was illuminated from within and lifted into prophecy in the full right sense of the word, and he saw the natural things he was alone gifted to see in their perfect form; and having that faith which is alone worth having, for it includes all others, a sure knowledge established in the constitution of his mind that perfect things are final things, he announced that all he had seen would come to pass. I do not think he troubled to understand books of economics, and Mr. Mackail says, I think, that they vexed him and wearied him. He found it enough to hold up, as it were, life as it is to-day beside his visions, and to show how faded its colours were and how sapless it was. And if we had not enough artistic feeling, enough feeling for the perfect that is, to admit the authority of the vision; or enough faith to understand that all that is imperfect passes away, he would not, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> think, <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> with us in a serious spirit. Though I think that he never used the kinds of words I use in writing of him, though I think he would even have disliked a word like faith with its theological associations, I am certain that he understood thoroughly, as all artists understand a little, that the important things, the things we must believe in or perish, are beyond argument. We can no more reason about them than can the pigeon, come but lately from the egg, about the hawk whose shadow makes it cower among the grass. His vision is true because it is poetical, because we are a little happier when we are looking at it; and he knew as Shelley knew by an act of faith that the economists should take their measurements not from life as it is, but from the vision of men like him, from the vision of the world made perfect that is buried under all minds. The early Christians were of the kin of the Wilderness and of the Dry Tree, and they saw an unearthly Paradise, but he was of the kin of the Well and of the Green Tree and he saw an Earthly Paradise.|$|R
30|$|SFL is {{not alone}} in having to address these issues. In other areas of linguistics, such as in typological studies, “[t]he {{structure}} of the lexicon and its consequences for the language system have received much less attention” (Hengeveld, Rijkhoff and Siewierska, 2004 : 527). However, considering the structure of the lexicon forces the theory to engage with the associated assumptions. For example, in considering certain noun and verb pairs resulting from conversion, such as talk, walk, etc., Luuk (2010 : 352) explains that “[i]n English … tense-aspect-mood marking encodes predicate and determiners encode argument”. The fluidity between nouns and verbs in these cases raises interesting questions about word classes <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> elsewhere Fontaine (2017 a).|$|E
40|$|As Kaarlo Tuori {{has often}} emphasized, {{one of the}} most {{important}} challenges the current legal reality in Europe raises for legal theory lies in the integration of autonomous legal orders applying directly to the same people, hence the impact of this European brand of legal pluralism on traditional legal theories. Indeed, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> elsewhere, what is needed in European legal theory is not only a translation of national concepts into European ones to avoid the dangers of rigid statism and of transposition of statist concepts onto post-national legal realities, but also a radical re-interpretation of national legal concepts themselves and hence a radical re-interpretation of national legal theory into an integrated European legal theory...|$|E
40|$|Scientists {{revel in}} new discoveries, {{especially}} when they overturn received wisdom. Paradoxically, however, scientists show little interest in changing how they go about their work. Consequently, the iron grip of habit and outdated assumptions controls their labs, institutions, socio-economic behaviours and future prospects. Moreover, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> before, unless scientists and the institutions that employ them make radical changes in the near future, the biomedical research enterprise in the United States will become unsus-tainable (Bourne, 2013).

Those qualifications indicate, however, significant differences between moral anger and other negative emotions; differences which {{must be taken into account}} when determining whether overcoming negative emotions other than moral anger count <b>as</b> forgiveness. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> proposed, too, that forgiveness requires neither overcoming all negative feelings (other than moral anger) nor the judgment that the offender is a wrongdoer...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> {{the case for}} Katherine Mansfield's Literary Expressionism in my {{selected}} stories 'Miss Brill', 'The Fly', 'The Daughters of the Late Colonel', 'Prelude' and 'At the Bay'. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that Mansfield's view of art is most significantly manifested in the dramatic scene in which the suggestion of character is made. It is largely within Mansfield's suggestive method that the poetry of her art is to be found. Through her particular precision with language, Mansfield achieves a peculiar clarity of expression. However, {{it is through the}} story's progressive form that the full meaning of her stories can be grasped. In line with the Expressionist concepts of 'harmony' and 'rhythm', Mansfield's stories develop through a number of composite images towards a complex idea, and thus conveying a total image. At the same time <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> wanted to identify Mansfield's Expressionist form, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> wished to untie some myths about her fiction, and the view that her persona and fiction are one, something which has spurred the widespread biographical bias in Mansfield criticism...|$|R
