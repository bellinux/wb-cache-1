40|$|A {{compression}} cell {{designed to}} fit inside an NMR spectrometer was used to investigate the in situ mechanical strain response, structural changes to the internal pore structure, and the diffusion and flow of interstitial water in full-thickness cartilage samples as it was deforming dynamically under a constant compressive load (pressure). We distinguish between the hydrostatic pressure acting on the interstitial fluid and the pore pressure acting on the cartilage fibril network. Our results show that properties related to the pore matrix microstructure such as diffusion and hydraulic conductivity are strongly influenced by the hydrostatic pressure in the interstitial fluid of the dynamically deforming cartilage which differ significantly from the properties measured under static i. e. equilibrium loading conditions (when the hydrostatic pressure has relaxed back to zero). The magnitude of the hydrostatic fluid pressure also appears to affect the way cartilage's pore matrix changes during deformation with implications for the diffusion and flow-driven fluid transport through the deforming pore matrix. We also show strong evidence for a highly anisotropic pore structure and deformational dynamics that allows cartilage to deform without significantly altering the <b>axial</b> <b>porosity</b> of the matrix even at very large strains. The insensitivity of the <b>axial</b> <b>porosity</b> to compressive strain may be playing a critical function in directing the flow of pressurized interstitial fluid in the compressed cartilage to the surface, to support the load, and provide a protective interfacial fluid film that 'weeps' out from the deforming tissue and thereby enhances the (elasto) hydrodynamic efficacy of sliding joints. Our results appear to show a close synergy between the structure of cartilage and both the hydrodynamic and boundary lubrication mechanisms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the velocity distribution through an annular bed packed randomly with equal sized spheres. Extensive research has been conducted on the velocity distribution inside packed beds packed with equal sized spheres, different sized spheres, deformed spheres, cylinders and Raschig-rings. A majority of these experimental and numerical studies focused on the cylindrical packed bed. These studies and numerical models are all confined to the velocity profile once the fluid flow is fully developed. The development of the velocity through the inlet region of the bed and the fluid flow redistribution in the outlet of the bed is thus neglected. The experimental investigation into the velocity distribution down stream of the annular packed bed of the HTTU indicated that the velocity profile was independent of the mass flow rate for a particle Reynolds number range of 439 £ Re £ 3453. These velocity profiles did not represent the distribution of the axial velocity due to shortcomings associated with the single sensor hot wire anemometry system used to measure the velocity distribution. A numerical investigation, using the RANS CFD code STAR-CCM+®, into the velocity distribution downstream of an explicitly modelled bed of spheres indicated that the axial velocity distribution could be extracted from the experimental velocity profiles by using an adjustment factor of 0. 801. This adjusted velocity profile was used in the verification of the implicit bed simulation model. The implicit bed simulation model was developed in STAR-CCM+®. The resistance of the spheres was modelled using the KTA (1981) pressure drop correlation and the structure of the bed was modelled using the porosity correlation proposed by Martin (1978), while the effective viscosity model of Giese et al. (1998), adjusted by a factor of 0. 8, was used to model the velocity distribution in the near wall region. It was found that the structure in the inlet region of the bed, where two walls disturb the packing structure, can be modelled as the weighted average of the radial and <b>axial</b> <b>porosity</b> while the structure in the outlet regions can be modelled by letting the radial porosity increase linearly to unity. The basic shape of the velocity profile is established immediately when the fluid enters the bed. The amplitude of the velocity peaks however increase in magnitude until the velocity profile is fully developed at a distance approximately of five sphere diameters from the bed inlet. The profile remains constant throughout the bed until the outlet region of the bed is reached. In the outlet region a significant amount of fluid redistribution is observed. The amplitude of the velocity peaks is reduced and the position of the velocity peaks is shifted inwards towards the centre of the annular region. The fully developed velocity profile, predicted by the simulation model is in good agreement with profiles presented by amongst others Giese et al. (1998). The current model however also offers insight into the development of the profile through the inlet of the bed and the fluid redistribution, which occurs in the outlet region of the bed.

40|$|International audienceWelding of {{pyroclastic}} deposits {{to reform}} a coherent rock mass {{is a common}} phenomenon, especially for pumiceous pyroclastic density current deposits (i. e., ignimbrites). However, and despite the pervasive abundance of block-and-ash flow (BAF) deposits in the geological and modern record, instances of strongly welded BAF deposits are few. Here, we present a series of high-temperature (800 - 900 °C) compaction experiments designed to map the conditions (deposit thickness/stress and temperature/viscosity) and timescales that permit or inhibit the welding of BAF deposits. Our experiments were performed on unconsolidated aggregates (containing an ash and lapilli component) derived from crushed and sieved lava blocks (containing 25 % crystals) taken from the well-documented welded BAF deposit at Mount Meager volcano (British Columbia, Canada). The experiments demonstrate that welding efficiency increases with increasing time and temperature. Progressive welding is expressed by increasing <b>axial</b> strain, <b>porosity</b> loss, and bulk density. The rate of change {{of each of these}} physical properties reduces as welding progresses. Microstructural analysis of the experimental products shows that the loss of interclast porosity during welding results from the progressive sintering and amalgamation of vitric fragments, and that the pore shape changes from sub-equant pores to stretched lenses sandwiched between vitric and crystal fragments. The coincidence between the microstructure and rock physical properties of the natural and experimental samples highlight that we have successfully reproduced welded BAF in the laboratory. Furthermore, our permeability measurements highlight a hysteresis in the return journey of the “there-and-back-again” volcanic permeability cycle (expressed by an increase in permeability due to vesiculation and fragmentation followed by a decrease due to welding). This hysteresis cannot be described by a single porosity-permeability power law relationship and reflects the change in pore shape and connectivity during welding. Finally, we show that a simple model for welding can accurately forecast the welding timescales of the BAF deposit at Mount Meager (as reconstructed from the collapse of the Lillooet River valley dam) using our experimental data. We use this validation as a platform to provide a universal window for the welding of BAF deposits, also applicable for comparable welded deposits (e. g., welded autobreccias in block-lavas and lava domes), for a broad range of deposit thickness (or stress) and effective viscosity...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{release from}} the crushed coal {{formation}} during coal mining {{poses a threat to}} the normal storage and gas transport within coal seam. This sort of release is largely related with the evolution of gas seepage properties of crushed coal, namely, the evolution of gas seepage properties {{plays an important role in}} the gas extraction and the outburst prevention of coal seam. Meanwhile, the evolution is directly related to the volume and geometry of fractures within the crushed coal and strongly influenced by particle size and <b>porosity</b> (<b>axial</b> displacement). In order to investigate the effect, a gas flow apparatus connecting with the MTS 815. 02 system was designed. The gas seepage properties of crushed coal specimens with five particle sizes of a (2. 5 – 5 mm), b (5 – 10 mm), c (10 – 15 mm), d (15 – 20 mm) and e (mixed sizes) under the variable axial displacement of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 mm, respectively are measured by the revised MTS 815. 02 system. The results of test show that: The porosity decreases with the increase of axial displacement and the weight loss of larger particle size, respectively. Particle crushing during compaction is a main reason to increase small-size and emerge size 0 – 2. 5 mm. Gas flow seepage properties of crushed coal are found to be strongly influenced by particle size and axial displacement. The permeability decreases and non–Darcy coefficient increases with the increase of axial displacement (decreases of porosity) and the decrease of larger particle size, respectively. The permeability and non-Darcy coefficient are controlled by the fracture among the coal particles. The seepage properties of crushed coal are not only related to particle size, loading levels (axial displacement), but also the compound mode. Based on the regression analysis, the relationship between the permeability and non-Darcy coefficient and porosity shows that the exponential function can fit the experimental data well...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{deformation}} of soil skeleton and migration of pore fluid {{are the major}} factors relevant to the triggering of and damages by liquefaction. The influence of pore fluid migration during earthquake has been demonstrated from recent model experiments and field case studies. Most of the current liquefaction assessment models are based on testing of isotropic liquefiable materials. However the recent New Zealand earthquake shows much severer damages than those predicted by existing models. A fundamental cause has been contributed to the embedded layers of low permeability silts. The existence of these silt layers inhibits water migration under seismic loads, which accelerated liquefaction and caused a much larger settlement than that predicted by existing theories. This study intends to understand the process of moisture migration in the pore space of sand using discrete element method (DEM) simulation. Simulations were conducted on consolidated undrained triaxial testing of sand where a cylinder sample of sand was built and subjected to a constant confining pressure and <b>axial</b> loading. The <b>porosity</b> distribution was monitored during the axial loading process. The spatial distribution of porosity change was determined, which had a direct relationship with the distribution of excess pore water pressure. The non-uniform distribution of excess pore water pressure causes moisture migration. From this, the migration of pore water during the loading process can be estimated. The results of DEM simulation show a few important observations: (1) External forces are mainly carried and transmitted by the particle chains of the soil sample; (2) Porosity distribution during loading is not uniform due to non-homogeneous soil fabric (i. e. the initial particle arrangement and existence of particle chains); (3) Excess pore water pressure develops differently at different loading stages. At the early stage of loading, zones with a high initial porosity feature higher porosity changes {{under the influence of}} external loading, which leads to a larger pore pressure variation (increase or decrease) in such zones. As the axial strain increases, particle rearrangement occurs and final porosity distribution has minor relationship with the initial condition, and the pore pressure distribution becomes irregular. The differences in the pore pressure development imply that water will migrate in the pore space in order to balance the pore water pressure distribution. The results of this simulation offer an insight on the microscale water migration in the soil pore space, which is important for holistic description of the triggering of soil liquefaction in light of its microstructure...|$|R
40|$|Concentrated {{suspensions}} of detergent powder solids in {{a liquid}} nonionic surfactant are considered for practical application as liquid detergent products. If no precautions are taken, upon storage the viscosity of such suspensions increases and the pourability drops because the suspensions are colloidally unstable. It {{has been found}} that after the addition of a small amount of dodecylbenzene sulphonic acid (DoBS-acid or HDoBS) good pourability is maintained on storage. All the phenomena observed with such suspensions suggest that the addition of DoBS-acid reduces coagulation and improves colloidal stability. It was hypothesized that the colloidal stability obtained is of an electrostatic nature. In a liquid non-aqueous medium this is unexpected. A study of the mechanism of stabilization is described in this thesis. After a general introduction to the topic in Chapter 1, in Chapter 2 we discuss the character of the interactions which play a role in nonionic suspensions. The used nonionics are condensates of long chain alcohols and 3 to 9 alkylene oxide units. The dispersed solids are sodium salts as are usually present in current detergent powders, or oxides. They are aggregates or agglomerates of smaller crystalline primary particles and consist of irregular spheroids. The solids, the liquid nonionics and the anionic acid have been characterized with respect to a number of properties, including the molecular and crystalline structure, specific density, specific surface area, <b>porosity,</b> <b>axial</b> ratio and water content. The refractive indices and dielectric constants of the liquids and solids are also measured. Elemental analysis of the supernatants of our suspensions is carried out by Atomic Absorption, by Plasma Emission and by X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Since analysis of the supernatants indicated only very limited dissolution of the solids, it is concluded that the suspensions are lyophobic. It is demonstrated that, when DoBS- acid is added to a suspension of sodium salts in nonionic, it is converted quantitatively into anionic NaDoBS. Sedimentation rates, sediment volumes and viscosities are important physical characteristics of concentrated nonionic suspensions; they reflect the interactions between the suspended particles. The interactions follow the DLVO-theory, meaning that they are governed by the balance between attractive and repulsive or 'stabilizing' forces. The literature on van der Waals attraction (energy and forces) between particles in suspension is discussed in Chapter 3. It shows that for particles in the micron-size range, geometrical parameters (differences in particle size, interparticle distance), retardation and surface roughness are of more importance than in colloidal systems, having smaller particles. This means that the van der Waals bonding energy obtained on approach is larger, but, as a function of increasing interparticle distances, it decays more rapidly. In the van der Waals attraction, material properties are reflected in the Hamaker constant. Hamaker constants for the inorganic crystalline solids considered in this study are not available in the literature. Therefore it was necessary to evaluate them theoretically. Two approaches have been applied, a macroscopic theory and a microscopic theory. In a comparison they gave identical results within a few tens of percent. For the crystalline detergent solids the constants have been evaluated from their dielectric constants and refractive indices. The results showed the Hamaker constants for the detergent solids (except activated Zeolite 4 A) to exceed those of the nonionics, but to be lower than those of the metal oxides. The differences between the constants of crystalline detergent solids and those of nonionics are relatively small, implying that suspensions of detergent solid particles in nonionics can be made to relatively high volume fractions and can be stabilized easily. In Chapter 4 the electrostatic theory for interactions of particle pairs in suspension is evaluated for its applicability in non-aqueous media, using models of plates and spheres. For both models the conclusion is that, for the calculation of the repulsive energies and forces, approximated equations can be used. They result in repulsive energies, pressures and forces, which are in good agreement with those of exact computations at distances> 10 nm, but underestimate the repulsions at shorter distances. DLVO energy and force curves have been constructed and demonstrate the dependence of the repulsion on five parameters that govern the behaviour, viz. the dielectric constant, the ionic strength, the electric surface potential, the Hamaker constant and the particle size. For our suspensions with surface potentials ≥ 20 mV, significant repulsions already develop at distances between 2 and 40 nm. The theoretical repulsions are much higher than the van der Waals attractions and cause much larger repulsive barriers than those usually reported for non- polar, nonaqueous media. They are expected {{to play a role in}} the colloidal stabilization of nonionic suspensions and to influence the resistance against coagulation under pressures at the bottom of sediments. Secondary minima are only a few kT at most and coagulation is only expected at the protrusion points of contact and at relatively high ionic strengths. Ionic strengths in HDoBS-stabilized suspensions in the nonionics Plurafac LFRA 30 and Imbentin C 91 / 35 are evaluated from the conductivity in the supernatants and from their respective limiting molar conductivities. The methodology is described in Chapter 5. It was found that in both nonionics the limiting molar conductivity was lower than predicted from the values in water assuming Walden's rule applies. The results indicate that solvation interactions of Na +and DoBS -ions in nonionics are stronger than in water and stronger in Imbentin than in Plurafac. In Chapter 6 the results of the electric and dielectric measurements have been given. It is shown that the dielectric constant of nonionic is increased by HDoBS. Taking this increase into account, the ionic strengths found can be satisfactorily explained from theory. Only at high HDoBS concentration and relatively high dielectric constants are the ion concentrations lower than theoretically predicted, a feature that could be due to the formation of 'molecular associates'. From the limiting conductivities, at HDoBS concentrations between 10 and 150 mM, the ionic strengths have been found to range from 0. 05 to 4 mM in Plurafac and from 0. 08 to 30 mM in Imbentin. These results demonstrate a weak dissociation of the NaDoBS electrolyte. However, the ionic strengths obtained are considerably larger than those in supernatants of unstable suspensions and are higher than ever reported in the 'non-polar' hydrocarbon media, commonly considered in non-aqueous studies. Liquid nonionic media have a dielectric constant between 5 and 12 and are denoted 'low-polar'. At these ionic strengths, and considering the enhancement of the dielectric constant by HDoBS, in the HDoBS concentration regime between 0. 5 and 150 mM, Debye lengths range from 33 to I nm in Plurafac and from 13 to 1 nm in Imbentin, i. e. in the same range as in aqueous media. Electrokinetic (ζ-) potentials of particles of detergent solids suspended in nonionics, given in Chapter 6, are found to be a function of the HDoBS concentration. The surface potentials tend to level off at HDoBS concentrations as low as 0. 5 % w/w (15 mM dm - 3 ), to a maximum value ranging from + 25 to + 70 mV, depending on the nature of the solid and the nonionic liquid. Addition of water or of a crown-complexant (15 -Crown- 5), reduces the ζ-potential. The formation of positive surface charges can be explained from the dissociation of adsorbed HDoBS. Mechanical properties of concentrated non-aqueous suspensions are discussed in Chapter 7, including their relation to the electrostatic repulsion. Rheology is used to monitor the properties under dynamic conditions. The consistency, which quantifies the particle interactions and shear thinning index was derived from the Sisko model. Addition of HDoBS was found to have little or no influence on the high shear rate viscosity of nonionic suspensions. This viscosity is governed by hydrodynamic interactions, which are, in turn, determined by the viscosity of the nonionic phase, the volume fraction and the temperature. The nature of the solid also has an influence on the 'infinite shear' viscosity, probably due to variations in protrusion size, causing their effective volumes to be larger than the actual volume. Measurements of the intrinsic viscosity of sodium tripolyphosphate (STP) indicated that the particles of this substance are almost spherical. Low shear rate viscosities monitor effects of interparticle interactions. The consistency was found to be inversely proportional to the particle volume. Addition of HDoBS reduces the consistency. As with the ~-potentials, the main effect is already obtained from 0. 5 % w/w HDoBS. In this respect the behaviour of the viscosity is correlated with that of the ~-potential of the particles. It is further found that the drop in the 'normalized' consistency has a direct relation to the electrostatic force. These results support the conclusion that the nature of the obtained stabilization is electrostatic. The correlation of the viscosity with the Péclet number further supports this conclusion. It shows that under shear HDoBS-stabilized systems can be considered as hard-sphere suspensions. Creep compliance measurements of suspensions of STP in Plurafac at high volume fractions demonstrated that at low shear stresses the interactions are completely elastic. Under those conditions, relaxation of the stress leads to almost complete recovery. The shear moduli derived from creep compliance, drop less steeply as a function of the volume fraction than predicted from the electrostatic repulsive barrier. It is possible that this difference is a result of secondary minimum coagulation by the particle protrusions. In static sediments the volume fractions can be measured as a function of height by γ-ray absorption. Measurements of γ-ray absorption shows that the particle concentration from top to bottom in a stable sediment shows a concentration gradient. For HDoBS-stabilized suspensions this gradient is more continuous, whereas in unstable suspensions, due to coagulation, it is very irregular. From these results the relations between the static pressure or the network modulus and the volume fraction are derived. Pressures show an exponential relation with the interparticle distances. With low levels of DoBS-acid the interparticle distances are larger than for high concentrations of HDoBS. These results are in agreement with the dependency predicted by electrostatic repulsion, although the experimental pressure drop as a function of distance is much smoother than that theoretically predicted. The experimental network moduli derived from the pressure-volume fraction relation also drop much more slowly than theoretically predicted. This may again be a result of secondary minimum coagulation occurring by the protrusions. The overall conclusion is that the suspensions under consideration are electrostatically stabilized with DoBS-acid as the charge-determining electrolyte...|$|R
