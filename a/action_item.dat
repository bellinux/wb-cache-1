[...] CARB identified the LCFS as an early <b>action</b> <b>item</b> with a regulation to be adopted and implemented by 2010. Also Executive Order S-1-07 ordered the California Environmental Protection Agency to coordinate activities between the University of California, the California Energy Commission and other state agencies to develop and propose a draft compliance schedule to meet the 2020 target.|$|E
50|$|A usual {{format for}} an <b>action</b> <b>item</b> is to record an <b>action</b> <b>item</b> number, the date when the <b>action</b> <b>item</b> is {{identified}} or created, {{the name of}} the person to whom the action is assigned, a title description of the action, a more detailed description of the action and its outcomes, and its deliverables.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to understand the distinction here that we track to resolution and not to completion. While it is the goal to have every <b>action</b> <b>item</b> completed, there are numerous scenarios in which the <b>action</b> <b>item</b> may no longer be relevant or completion may not be possible.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and key federal agencies have made progress on <b>action</b> <b>items</b> in the Information Technology (IT) Reform Plan, but there are several areas where more remains to be done. Of the 10 key <b>action</b> <b>items</b> GAO reviewed, 3 were completed and 7 were partially completed by December 2011, {{in part because the}} initiatives are complex. OMB reported greater progress than GAO determined, stating that 7 of the 10 <b>action</b> <b>items</b> were completed and that 3 were partially completed. While OMB officials acknowledge that there is more to do in each of the topic areas, they consider the key <b>action</b> <b>items</b> to be completed because the IT Reform Plan has served its purpose as a catalyst for a set of broader initiatives. They explained that work will continue on all of the initiatives even after OMB declares that the related <b>action</b> <b>items</b> are completed under the IT Reform Plan. We disagree with this approach. In prematurely declaring the <b>action</b> <b>items</b> to be completed, OMB risks losing momentum on the progress it has made to date. Until OMB and the agencies complete the <b>action</b> <b>items,</b> the benefits of the reform initiativesincluding increased operational efficiencies and more effective management of large-scale IT programswill likely be delayed. ...|$|R

40|$|More than 65 people (with varying backgrounds) {{involved}} with or {{interested in the}} reduction of deer-vehicle crashes (DVCs) attended the October 2005 “Deer-Vehicle Crash Reductions: Setting a Strategic Agenda” conference. At this meeting the attendees collaborated and brainstormed to identify strategic agenda <b>action</b> <b>items</b> for DVC reduction research and data collection, funding, partnership building, and technology transfer and education. Focus groups were created to discuss each of these subject areas. This poster summarizes the results of those discussions. Each of the focal groups was initially asked to identify the concerns/problems it thought should be resolved to help reduce DVCs within their subject area (and overall). They also provided goals/objectives that could be achieved within their subject area during {{the next three to}} five years, along with the strategic agenda <b>action</b> <b>items</b> that could help accomplish these goals/objectives. The focus of each group was different and in some cases their suggested strategic agenda <b>action</b> <b>items</b> were very specific. In other cases, however, similar suggestions were provided by more than one group. Four common themes or general categories were identified among the strategic agenda <b>action</b> <b>items</b> suggested. The first category includes <b>action</b> <b>items</b> that help facilitate and guide intra- and inter-agency coordination with respect to the DVC problem. The second category included <b>action</b> <b>items</b> that increase the general awareness of the DVC issue by effectively and efficiently providing the correct message to a wide range of audiences. The third group included <b>action</b> <b>items</b> to encourage the consistent collection of DVC-related data, and the fourth group of <b>action</b> <b>items</b> promotes the development, implementation, and evaluation of potential and existing DVC countermeasures. A strategic agenda document was created from the meeting activities and results. It should be used as a guide to those individuals and groups interested in advancing the reduction of DVCs. This poster summarizes the content of that strategic agenda document...|$|R

40|$|Concept mapping {{is a tool}} {{to assist}} in {{strategic}} planning that allows planners to work through a sequence of phases to produce a conceptual framework. Although several studies describe how concept mapping is applied to various public health problems, {{the flexibility of the}} methods used in each phase of the process is often overlooked. If practitioners were more aware of the flexibility, more public health endeavors could benefit from using concept mapping as a tool for strategic planning. The objective {{of this article is to}} describe how the 6 concept-mapping phases originally outlined by William Trochim guided our strategic planning process and how we adjusted the specific methods in the first 2 phases to meet the specialized needs and requirements to create The Healthy Brain Initiative: A National Public Health Road Map to Maintaining Cognitive Health. In the first stage (phases 1 and 2 of concept mapping), we formed a steering committee, convened 4 work groups over a period of 3 months, and generated an initial set of 42 <b>action</b> <b>items</b> grounded in science. In the second stage (phases 3 and 4), we engaged stakeholders in sorting and rating the <b>action</b> <b>items</b> and constructed a series of concept maps. In the third and final stage (phases 5 and 6), we examined and refined the <b>action</b> <b>items</b> and generated a final concept map consisting of 44 <b>action</b> <b>items.</b> We then selected the top 10 <b>action</b> <b>items,</b> and in 2007, we published The Health...|$|R
