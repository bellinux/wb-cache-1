That generates also a significant loss of arable land. Yet, the soil resource is not an unlimited commodity. Moreover, sediments’ transfer to watercourses alters their physical and chemical quality. The watershed management should aim at both limiting erosion and enhancing deposition in <b>appropriate</b> <b>zones.</b> Therefore, the global objective of this work is to acquire hydropedological data {{in order to better}} quantify the erosion and deposition phenomenon in Belgium. The poster presents the field monitoring put in place in our experimental watershed. Indeed, observed quantitative data are essential but still limited. Particularly, we lack observations spatially distributed on the watershed. The watershed is a 124 ha agricultural zone in the loamy region. Its slopes range from 0 % to 9 %. Instrumentation includes a weather station with disdrometer, discharge measurement at the outlet coupled with water sampling. Fields observations are done to determine the texture redistribution and compared with a previous soil survey realised in 1958. Moreover, regular flights above the area will allow us to obtain a very accurate DEM using Lidar technology (5 cm pixel) and observing the relief evolution.

40|$|Abstract. Continuous {{audio-visual}} surveillance is {{utilized to}} ensure the physical safety of critical infrastructures such as airports, nuclear power plants and national laboratories. In order to do so, traditional surveillance systems place cameras, microphones and other sensory input devices in appropriate locations [Sch 99]. These facilities are arranged in a hierarchy of physical zones reflecting the secrecy of the guarded information. Guards in these facilities carry clearances that permit them only in <b>appropriate</b> <b>zones</b> of the hierarchy, and monitor the facilities by using devices such as hand-held displays that send streaming media of the guarded zones possibly with some instructions. The main security constraint applicable to this model is that any guard can see streams emanating from locations with secrecy levels equal to or lower than theirs, but not higher. We show how to model these surveillance requirements using the synchronized multimedia integration language (SMIL) [Aya 01] with appropriate security enhancements. Our solution consists of imposing a multi-level security model on SMIL documents to specify surveillance requirements. Our access control model ensures that a multimedia stream can only be displayed on a device if the security clearance of the display device dominates the security clearance of the monitored zone. Additionally, we pre-process a set of cover stories that can be released during emergency situations that allow using the services of guards with lower clearances without disclosing data with higher sensitive levels. For this, we create a view for each level, and show that these views are semantically coherent and comply with specified security polices...|$|E

When a mirror was used to duplicate either of the two horizons, the insects were not able to orient. The insects moved towards an artificially dark horizon (the reverse of the mirror) placed down-shore, the opposite of their usual direction of movement. The insects had an endoge-nous circatidal rhythm of phototactic behaviour: most of the population was always negatively phototactic, but between 2 and 7 h after low tide, a significant proportion of the population became positively phototactic.

40|$|Any mapping or {{analysis}} involving population data aggregated to {{geographical areas}} (zones) {{is subject to}} the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), namely that observed patterns are influenced by both the scale (size) and aggregation (boundary placement) of zones. This has important implications, not only for researchers undertaking analyses, but also for national statistical organisations needing to decide what zoning system(s) (sets of zones) to employ to release population data. This thesis explores, enhances and extends automated zone design techniques for the spatial representation of population. It addresses three key themes: the use of automated zone design to explore the modifiable areal unit problem; automated maintenance and adaptation of existing zoning systems; and the importance of building blocks in automated zone design. It shows that administrative geographies are not necessarily the most <b>appropriate</b> <b>zones</b> for exploring health and environment relationships and that automated zone design can be used to explore sensitivity of results to the MAUP. It demonstrates that automated procedures can be used to update existing zoning systems which have become unfit for purpose due to population change, and also to modify existing zones to make them suitable for representation of other phenomena such as workplace statistics. It provides evidence that building blocks are a crucial, but under-rated, component of the zone design process and concludes that all zone design should be based on sound theoretical reasoning and a clear conceptualisation of the phenomena and processes being represented.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{environmental}} factors on walking behavior are explored {{based on the}} purpose of the walking trip. Since everybody walks for daily transportation, studying the walking behavior of those who walk for transport would contribute to maintain the minimum rate of physical activity. Commuters are the major group of pedestrians who walk for their daily transportation along the pathways of central business district (CBD). In Kuala Lumpur’s CBD, an average of 120, 000 commuters passes through it daily. It provides the commuters several alternative pathways between metro stations and workplaces. Despite the significance of shorter time and distance as path choice criteria of commuters, while presence of multiple pathways with almost the same length, perceived time and perceived distance as well as certain environmental factors would play the key role in path choice of commuters. In this regard, this study investigates on perceived complexity (PC) and perceived legibility (PL) as path choice criteria of commuters. This study was conducted in nine zones of CBD of Kuala Lumpur. These nine zones were the results of zone selection process which was designed to select the <b>appropriate</b> <b>zones</b> of study. Two survey questionnaires and an observational analysis were used to elicit data on the PC and PL. During the survey questionnaire, the commuters were followed and their traversed walkways were recorded. Fifty four commuters were determined for the first survey and 324 commuters were selected for the second survey questionnaire. Data was analyzed using SPSS Version 16 and the tests including multiple regression, Pearson correlation, and t-Test were run. The lowest PC and the highest PL showed moderate importance regarding the path choice of commuters as compared with the other examined path choice criteria. It was also found that these two perceptual factors via a significant correlation with perceived time, rate of pleasant and rate of comfort contribute to the path choice of the commuters. Furthermore, the physical factors that are presence of people, conflict with motor vehicles and presence of buildings specified by their height and facade are taken into account as related to PC and PL of the commuters. This research concludes that the urban design factors that are improving the safety of commuters from the motor vehicles, increasing the number of buildings, specified by their height and facade, and heightening the buildings located near the metro stations contribute to improve the path choice and the walking rate of commuters in the pathways of the CBD of Kuala Lumpur...|$|E
40|$|The H 2020 project URBANFLUXES (URBan ANthrpogenic heat FLUX from Earth {{observation}} Satellites) {{investigates the}} potential of Copernicus Sentinels to retrieve anthropogenic heat flux, as {{a key component of}} the Urban Energy Budget (UEB). Temperatures in cities are predicted to rise even more in the future, resulting in increased energy demand for cooling systems in low and mid-latitude cities, modifying UEB. A positive feedback cycle occurs in many urban areas, where higher temperatures result in more energy being used for cooling, which in turn adds to heat emissions and increases temperatures further during periods with increased heat wave risk. It is expected that without mitigation measures, energy demand will continue to increase during the warmest months. URBANFLUXES advances the current knowledge of the impacts of UEB fluxes on urban heat island and consequently on energy consumption in cities. This will lead to the development of tools and strategies to mitigate these effects, improving thermal comfort and energy efficiency. In URBANFLUXES, the anthropogenic heat flux is estimated as a residual of UEB. Therefore, the rest UEB components, namely, the net all-wave radiation, the net change in heat storage and the turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes are independently estimated from Earth Observation (EO), whereas the advection term is included in the error of the anthropogenic heat flux estimation from the UEB closure. A dense network of conventional meteorological stations is used in each case study city: London, Basel and Heraklion. EO data is initially analyzed to map urban surface morphology and cover, whilst a new approach has been developed to define <b>appropriate</b> <b>zones</b> for energy partitioning. Using these zones as a framework, advanced EO-based methods are used to estimate UEB fluxes: a sophisticated radiative transfer model (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) was employed to simulate the net all-wave radiation; the computation of the storage term was based on the Element Surface Temperature Method, supported by the auxiliary datasets; and the estimation of the turbulent heat fluxes was based on the Aerodynamic Resistance Method, supported by standard meteorological measurements. In-situ flux measurements (Eddy Covariance, scintillometry) and bottom-up approaches (inventories, building energy models) were used to evaluate URBANFLUXES outcomes, whereas uncertainties were specified and analyzed. The project exploits Sentinels observations, which provide improved data quality, coverage and revisit times and increase the value of EO data for scientific work and future emerging applications. These observations can reveal novel scientific insights for the detection and monitoring of the spatial distribution of the urban energy budget fluxes in cities, thereby generating new EO opportunities. URBANFLUXES thus exploits the European capacity for space-borne observations to enable the development of operational services in the field of urban environmental monitoring and energy efficiency in cities. It is therefore expected to prepare the ground for further innovative exploitation of European space data in scientific activities (climate variability studies at local and regional scales) and future and emerging applications (sustainable urban planning, mitigation technologies) to benefit climate change mitigation/adaptation and civil protection.

Similarly, changing the zone system in transport modeling requires complete recalibration of the model.

For mobile multi-hop wireless network, IEEE 802.16 j/MR network not only can supply large area wireless deployment, but also provide high quality network service to mobile users. In this paper, a novel Zone-based bandwidth management scheme is proposed to maintain mobile users in the IEEE 802.16 -MR network. Based on our proposed scheme, mobile users can achieve their QoS satisfaction and requirement in the IEEE 802.16 -MR network. In the topology analysis, the chessboard network topology is more suitable for bandwidth allocation. Simulation study has demonstrated our proposed scheme can meet user's requirement even mobile users have different mobility behavior. The larger zone size can effectively reduce QoS degradation and bandwidth re-allocation but decreases bandwidth utilization. It follows that Zone-based bandwidth management scheme can be strengthened and better ways of QoS supporting are needed for MHs in IEEE 802.16 -MR network. Future work of the research is to design an adaptive Zone size scheme to select the <b>appropriate</b> <b>zone</b> size for mobile users with different movement and mobility distribution characteristic.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} method of two level {{modeling}} for model-based testing of robotics applications. The goal is to perform model-based hardware-in-the-loop testing {{of a system of}} robots. The main idea is to use models in two different roles: as control models of individual robots, and as a coordination model on the global level for modeling the behavior of the system. This way it is possible to reduce the total state space visible to the system level model since the local abstractors discard details that are not important from the global perspective. We demonstrate the approach with model programs of the toolkit NModel in the context of LEGO NXT based mobile robots. The system consists of robots sharing a critical resource — an intersection where they must not collide. The local control model distinguishes whether the robot is in the critical section and has the means to pause the robot in an <b>appropriate</b> <b>zone.</b> The coordination model provides the system view and enables to detect system level errors, for example whether it is possible that two robots enter the critical section at the same time.

40|$|Currently, most of {{the costs}} {{associated}} with operating and maintaining the roadway infrastructure are paid for by revenue collected from the motor fuel use tax. As fuel efficiency and the use of alternative fuel vehicles increases, alternatives to this funding method must be considered. One such alternative is to assess mileage based user fees (MBUF) based on the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) aggregated within the predetermined geographic areas, or travel zones, in which the VMT is generated. Most of the systems capable of this use Global Positioning Systems (GPS). However, GPS has issues with public perception, commonly associated with unwanted monitoring or tracking and is thus considered an invasion of privacy. The method proposed here utilizes cellular assignment, which is capable of determining a vehicle’s current travel zone, but is incapable of determining a vehicle’s precise location, thus better preserving user privacy. This is accomplished with a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm focused on the boundary of such travel zones. The work described here focuses on the design and evaluation of algorithms and methods that when combined, would enable such a system. The primary experiment performed evaluates the accuracy of the algorithm at sample boundaries in and around the commercial business district of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The results show that with the training data available, the algorithm can correctly detect when a vehicle crosses a boundary to within ± 2 city blocks, or roughly ± 200 meters, and is thus capable of assigning the VMT to the <b>appropriate</b> <b>zone.</b> The findings imply that a cellular-based VMT system may successfully aggregate VMT by predetermined geographic travel zones without infringing on the drivers’ privacy.

Settlement and recruitment were found to be intimately related to the period of sexual reproduction, and determined by the local production of larvae. In this sense, the population's spawning potential (larvae m(- 2)) matched a perfect linear relationship (R- 2 = 0. 9496, p < 0. 05) with the settlement and recruitment registered on experimental settlement surfaces. Of the larvae produced by the population 29 % settled locally, contributing to the consolidation of populations already established. Only 1. 3 % of the larval production theoretically calculated developed into colonies at a local level. To determine how Settlement site might contribute to the colonies' survival and thus to population distribution, zooids were transplanted from an <b>appropriate</b> <b>zone</b> to a stressful zone, which showed that there is a risk of inappropriate habitat selection for settlement. The behaviour of the larvae (philopatry) and gregarious settlement in unpredictable environments (spatio-temporally variable) seems advantageous to prevent advection to inappropriate sites. E. turbinata ensures local recruitment and renewal of the established population, but it seems that there is partial dispersal of larvae beyond the parent population. The study shows that there is sufficient recruitment from within the population to maintain it and the timing of larval production and recruitment strongly suggest that recruits are from the population itself...|$|R
