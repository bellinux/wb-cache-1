5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt.

A reduction in sodium intake by 1,000mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent. In adults and children with no acute illness, {{a decrease in the}} intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low sodium diet results in <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension.|$|E
