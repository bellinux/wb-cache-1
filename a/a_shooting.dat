5|$|Baeyertz did {{not intend}} to convert to Christianity when she married him, but she {{subsequently}} did for the sake of her children. Her husband {{died as a result of}} <b>a</b> <b>shooting</b> accident in 1871, whereupon she experienced a full conversion to Christianity.

5|$|Baeyertz's {{husband died}} on 6 March 1871 {{at the age}} of 28, two days after <b>a</b> <b>shooting</b> accident.

5|$|Born on January 16, 1980, Pujols {{was raised}} in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, mostly by his grandmother, America Pujols, and 10 of his uncles and aunts. He was an only child.

Pujols, his father, and his grandmother immigrated in 1996 to New York City, where Albert witnessed <b>a</b> <b>shooting</b> at a grocery store. Partly because of the shooting, they moved to Independence, Missouri, two months later to join some relatives.|$|E

5|$|Due to its {{imposing}} architecture, Senate House {{is popular}} with the film and television industries as <b>a</b> <b>shooting</b> location; often for official buildings.

They identified it as Hesketh's {{and concluded that the}} 18-year-old must have taken it and gone on <b>a</b> <b>shooting</b> spree the previous day. Lamb was arrested at 15:30 on 26 June and charged with the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski. Under the terms of Canadian law at that time, he faced a mandatory death penalty if convicted. When Woloch's injuries also proved fatal at 14:45 on 11 July 1966, his murder was added to Lamb's charge.|$|E
