500|$|On the ice, Stewart showed good {{judgment}} as a defenceman and rarely took {{himself out of}} position to throw a hit. His coach in Detroit, Jack Adams, called Stewart [...] "one of the best blueliners in the game", and claimed {{he was the best}} defenceman in Red Wings history. [...] Regarded as a good skater, he was able to clear the puck out of his zone and rarely turned it over to the other team.

His job was defence <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> the league knew it." ...|$|E

2500|$|US District Judge Stanley Sporkin was a vocal {{opponent}} of the practice during his review of the settlement resulting from United States v. Microsoft Corp. in 1994.

One of the accusations made during the trial was that Microsoft has illegally used early announcements. The review began when three anonymous companies protested the settlement, claiming {{the government did not}} thoroughly investigate Microsoft's use of the practice. Specifically, they claimed Microsoft announced its Quick Basic 3 program to slow sales of its competitor Borland's recently released Turbo Basic program. The review was dismissed for lack of explicit proof.|$|E
2500|$|I love Shakespeare. He wrote {{some of the}} rawest stories, man. I mean look at Romeo and Juliet. That's {{some serious}} ghetto shit. You got this guy Romeo from the Bloods who falls for Juliet, a female from the Crips, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> both gangs is against them. So they have to sneak out and they end up dead for nothing. Real tragic stuff. And look how Shakespeare busts it up with Macbeth. He creates a tale about this king's wife who convinces a happy man to chase after her and kill her husband so he can take over the country. After he commits the murder, the dude starts having {{delusions}} just like in a Scarface song. I mean the king's wife just screws this guy's whole life up for nothing [...]|$|E
2500|$|In April 2008, the Daily News {{reported}} that Issa questioned federal expenditures pertaining to disability-compensation claims from 9/11 first responders. He {{was criticized for}} making comments {{that the federal government}} [...] "'just threw' buckets of cash at New York for an attack 'that had no dirty bomb in it, it had no chemical munitions in it'" [...] and asking [...] "why the firefighters who went there <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> the city of New York needs to come to the federal government for the dollars versus this being primarily a state consideration." [...] In September 2009, Issa's office released a statement indicating that his comments had been misrepresented and that the questions he asked concerned the then still unpassed bill H.R. 3543, which, according to that statement [...] "would give U.S. taxpayer dollars to those who did not suffer physical injury and did not work at or around Ground Zero." ...|$|E
