40|$|Abstract Background During {{pregnancy}} {{the immune}} system of the mother must protect any activation that may negatively affect the fetus. Changes in susceptibility to infection as well as resolution of some autoimmune disorders represent empirical evidence for pregnancy related alterations in immunity. Sex hormones reach extremely high levels during pregnancy and {{have been shown to}} have direct effects on many immune functions including the antiviral response of dendritic cells. Among the immunologically active proteins secreted by monocyte derived DCs (MDDC) are the <b>alpha-defensins</b> 1 - 3. This family of cationic antimicrobial peptides has a broad spectrum of microbicidal activity and has also been shown to link innate to adaptive immunity by attracting T cells and immature DCs, which are essential for initiating and polarizing the immune response. Methods We compare culture-generated monocyte derived DCs (MDDCs) with directly isolated myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and measure their <b>alpha-defensins</b> 1 - 3 secretion by ELISA both, in basal situations and after hormone (E 2 or PG) treatments. Moreover, using a cohort of pregnant women we isolated mDCs from blood and also measure the levels of these anti-microbial peptides along pregnancy. Results We show that mDCs and pDCs constitutively produce <b>alpha-defensins</b> 1 - 3 and at much higher levels than MDDCs. <b>Alpha-defensins</b> 1 - 3 production from mDCs and MDDCs but not pDCs is inhibited by E 2. PG does not affect <b>alpha-defensins</b> 1 - 3 in any of the populations. Moreover, <b>alpha-defensins</b> 1 - 3 production by mDCs was reduced in the later stages of pregnancy in 40 % of the patients. Conclusions Here, we demonstrate that mDCs and pDCs secrete <b>alpha-defensins</b> 1 - 3 and present a novel effect of E 2 on the secretion of <b>alpha-defensins</b> 1 - 3 by dendritic cells. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>alpha-defensins</b> in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) {{was investigated in}} a cohort of preterm newborns with gestational age (GA) < or = 30 wk. Specimens were collected {{during the first week}} of life from 24 preterm neonates mechanically ventilated. The studied population was divided into two groups: pneumonia group of nine neonates suffering from pulmonary infection (GA: 26. 1 +/- 2. 1 wk; birth weight: 787. 4 +/- 309. 9 g), with or without associated bloodstream infection, and nonpneumonia group of 15 neonates (GA: 27. 7 +/- 2. 0 wk; birth weight: 1019. 0 +/- 319. 8 g). BALF culture was positive for CONS (n = 5), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), and Candida spp (n = 3). BALF samples were analyzed by HPLC-electrospray Ionization-mass spectrometer. The <b>alpha-defensins</b> 1 - 4 concentration, absolute and differential white cells count were measured. Relative amounts of <b>alpha-defensins</b> 1 - 4 and the absolute number of neutrophils were found significantly higher in the pneumonia group with respect to the nonpneumonia group (p < 0. 05). Moreover, positive significant correlations between the number of neutrophils and the <b>alpha-defensins</b> 1 - 3 levels were observed. In conclusion, our data show that preterm newborns, also at the lower GA, are able to produce <b>alpha-defensins,</b> underlining that their innate defense system is already active before the at-term delivery date...|$|R

40|$|The <b>alpha-defensin</b> {{antimicrobial}} peptide {{family is}} defined by a unique tridisulfide array. To test whether this invariant structural feature determines <b>alpha-defensin</b> bactericidal activity, mouse cryptdin- 4 (Crp 4) tertiary structure was disrupted by pairs of site-directed Ala for Cys substitutions. In a series of Crp 4 disulfide variants whose cysteine connectivities were confirmed using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, mutagenesis did not induce loss of function. To the contrary, the in vitro bactericidal activities of several Crp 4 disulfide variants were equivalent {{to or greater than}} those of native Crp 4. Mouse Paneth cell alpha-defensins require the proteolytic activation of precursors by matrix metalloproteinase- 7 (MMP- 7), prompting an analysis of the relative sensitivities of native and mutant Crp 4 and proCrp 4 molecules to degradation by MMP- 7. Although native Crp 4 and the <b>alpha-defensin</b> moiety of proCrp 4 resisted proteolysis completely, all disulfide variants were degraded extensively by MMP- 7. Crp 4 bactericidal activity was eliminated by MMP- 7 cleavage. Thus, rather than determining <b>alpha-defensin</b> bactericidal activity, the Crp 4 disulfide arrangement confers essential protection from degradation by this critical activating proteinase...|$|E
40|$|Salt-bridge {{interactions}} between acidic and {{basic amino acids}} contribute to the structural stability of proteins and to protein-protein interactions. A conserved salt-bridge is a canonical feature of the <b>alpha-defensin</b> antimicrobial peptide family, but the role of this common structural element has not been fully elucidated. We have investigated mouse Paneth cell <b>alpha-defensin</b> cryptdin- 4 (Crp 4) and peptide variants with mutations at Arg(7) or Glu(15) residue positions to disrupt the salt-bridge and assess the consequences on Crp 4 structure, function, and stability. NMR analyses showed that both (R 7 G) -Crp 4 and (E 15 G) -Crp 4 adopt native-like structures, evidence of fold plasticity that allows peptides to reshuffle side chains and stabilize the structure {{in the absence of}} the salt-bridge. In contrast, introduction of a large hydrophobic side chain at position 15, as in (E 15 L) -Crp 4 cannot be accommodated in the context of the Crp 4 primary structure. Regardless of which side of the salt-bridge was mutated, salt-bridge variants retained bactericidal peptide activity with differential microbicidal effects against certain bacterial cell targets, confirming that the salt-bridge does not determine bactericidal activity per se. The increased structural flexibility induced by salt-bridge disruption enhanced peptide sensitivity to proteolysis. Although sensitivity to proteolysis by MMP 7 was unaffected by most Arg(7) and Glu(15) substitutions, every salt-bridge variant was degraded extensively by trypsin. Moreover, the salt-bridge facilitates adoption of the characteristic <b>alpha-defensin</b> fold as shown by the impaired in vitro refolding of (E 15 D) -proCrp 4, the most conservative salt-bridge disrupting replacement. In Crp 4, therefore, the canonical <b>alpha-defensin</b> salt-bridge facilitates adoption of the characteristic <b>alpha-defensin</b> fold, which decreases structural flexibility and confers resistance to degradation by proteinases...|$|E
40|$|The various granule subtypes of {{the human}} {{neutrophil}} differ in propensity for exocytosis. As a rule, granules formed at late stages of myelopoiesis have a higher secretory potential than granules formed in more immature myeloid cells. Neutrophils contain four closely related <b>alpha-defensins,</b> which are stored in a subset of azurophil granules. These defensin-rich azurophil granules (DRG) are formed later than defensin-poor azurophil granules, near the promyelocyte/myelocyte transition. In order to characterize the secretory properties of DRG, we developed a sensitive and accurate ELISA for detection of the neutrophil <b>alpha-defensins</b> HNP 1 - 3. This allowed us to quantify the exocytosis of <b>alpha-defensins</b> and markers of azurophil (myeloperoxidase), specific (lactoferrin) and gelatinase (gelatinase) granules from neutrophils stimulated with different secretagogues. The release pattern of <b>alpha-defensins</b> correlated perfectly {{with the release of}} myeloperoxidase and showed no resemblance to the exocytosis of lactoferrin or gelatinase. This finding was substantiated through subcellular fractionation experiments. In conclusion, despite a distinct profile of biosynthesis, DRG are indistinguishable from defensin-poor azurophil granules with respect to exocytosis. Thus, in contrast to peroxidase-negative granules, azurophil granules display homogeneity in their availability for extracellular release...|$|R
50|$|Human neutrophil-derived <b>alpha-defensins</b> (HNPs) {{are capable}} of {{enhancing}} phagocytosis by mouse macrophages. HNP1-3 {{have been reported to}} increase the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1, while decreasing the production of IL-10 by monocytes. Increased levels of proinflammatory factors (e.g., IL-1, TNF, histamine and prostaglandin D2) and suppressed levelsof IL-10 at the site of microbial infection are likely to amplify local inflammatory responses. This might be further reinforced by the capacity of some human and rabbit <b>alpha-defensins</b> to inhibit the production of immunosuppressive glucocorticoids by competing for the binding of adrenocorticotropic hormone to its receptor. Moreover, human <b>alpha-defensins</b> can enhance or suppress the activation of the classical pathway of complement in vitro by binding to solid-phase or fluid-phase complement C1q, respectively. The capacity of defensins to enhance phagocytosis, promote neutrophil recruitment, enhance the production of proinflammatory cytokines, suppress anti-inflammatory mediators and regulate complement activation argues that defensins upregulate innate host inflammatory defenses against microbial invasion.|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} {{have been}} identified as key elements in the innate host defense against infection. Recent studies have indicated that the activity of antimicrobial peptides may be decreased in cystic fibrosis, suggesting a major role for these peptides in host defense against infection. One of the most intensively studied classes of antimicrobial peptides are defensins. Defensins comprise a family of cationic peptides that in human subjects can be divided into the alpha- and beta-defensin subfamilies. The <b>alpha-defensins</b> are produced by neutrophils and intestinal Paneth's cells, whereas beta-defensins are mainly produced by epithelial cells. Although studies on beta-defensins have so far focused on their antimicrobial activity, studies on <b>alpha-defensins</b> have suggested a role of these peptides in inflammation, wound repair, and specific immune responses. <b>alpha-Defensins,</b> which accumulate in airway secretions of patients with various chronic inflammatory lung disorders, were shown to be cytotoxic toward airway epithelial cells and to induce chemokine secretion in several cell types. Furthermore, the capacity of <b>alpha-defensins</b> to promote bacterial adherence to epithelial cells in vitro further supports a role for these peptides in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis. Increased numbers of neutrophils are also present in the airways of patients with asthma, suggesting that neutrophils are involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Because defensins are able to induce histamine release by mast cells and increase the airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine, it is tempting to speculate that defensins may also contribute to the inflammatory processes in asthma. Besides these proinflammatory effects, <b>alpha-defensins</b> may also display anti-inflammatory activities, including regulation of complement activation and proteinase inhibitor secretion. Finally, defensins may be involved in wound repair because defensins increase epithelial cell proliferation. Thus recent defensin research has revealed potential links between the innate and acquired immune syste...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in saliva {{may be a}} biological factor that contributes to susceptibility or resistance to caries. This manuscript will review AMPs in saliva, consider their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory functions, and evaluate their potential role in the oral cavity for protection of the tooth surface {{as well as the}} oral mucosa. These AMPs are made in salivary gland and duct cells and have broad antimicrobial activity. Alpha-defensins and LL 37 are also released by neutrophils into the gingival crevicular fluid. Both sources may account for their presence in saliva. A recent study in middle school children aimed to determine a possible correlation between caries prevalence in children and salivary concentrations of the antimicrobial peptides human beta-defensin- 3 (hBD- 3), the cathelicidin, LL 37, and the alpha-defensins. The levels of these AMPs were highly variable in the population. While levels of LL 37 and hBD- 3 did not correlate with caries experience, the mean <b>alpha-defensin</b> level was significantly higher in children with no caries than in children with caries (p < 0. 005). We conclude that several types of AMPs that may have a role in oral health are present in unstimulated saliva. Low salivary levels of <b>alpha-defensin</b> may represent a biological factor that contributes to caries susceptibility.

The two control groups did not show significant differences. The reduced level of oral <b>alpha-defensins,</b> which are mainly of crevicular origin, is most likely due {{to the absence of}} the gingival sulcus in the edentulous subjects.

40|$|Human <b>alpha-defensins</b> are {{cationic}} peptides with potent antitoxic, antimicrobial and chemotactic {{activities in}} the innate and adaptive immunity. Bacillus anthracis produces a lethal factor [LF], which is a potent toxin, capable of cell lysis. The molecular mechanism of the inhibition of LF by human <b>alpha-defensins</b> and the bacterial strain selectivity are not fully understood. Also, the pore-formation model that relates the cationic property to the antibacterial activity of human <b>alpha-defensins</b> cannot fully explain the bacterial strain selectivity. The aims of this dissertation were: a) to elucidate the molecular determinants {{and the nature of}} the inhibition of LF by two well-studied <b>alpha-defensins,</b> human neutrophil peptide 1 [HNP 1] and human defensin 5 [HD 5], and b) to explore the mechanism of bactericidal activities of HNP 1 and HD 5 against Staphylococcus aureus [S. aureus]. We hypothesized that: a) the nature of the contact residues within these peptides influences the inhibitory activity against LF and the antibacterial effect against S. aureus, and b) the quaternary structures of HNP 1 and HD 5 are crucial to the inhibition of LF and their antibacterial effect against S. aureus. We used alanine-scan mutagenesis of HNP 1 and HD 5 followed by functional assays to identify residues that contributed to LF inhibition and bactericidal activity against S. aureus. The results identified that tryptophane 26 [Trp 26] in HNP 1 and leucine 29 [Leu 29] in HD 5 were the essential residues for the inhibition of LF and the bactericidal activity against S. aureus. Also, the results demonstrated that the hydrophobicity of HNP 1 and HD 5 as well as the dimerization and/or oligomerization were prerequisite to the LF inhibition and bactericidal activity against S. aureus. We concluded that Trp 26 and Leu 29 in HNP 1 and HD 5, respectively, as well as the hydrophobicity and self-association were the molecular determinants for LF inhibition and the bactericidal activity against S. aureus. The HNP 1 and HD 5 analogs are potentially useful tools for future studies towards the development of new anti-toxins.

The definition of this variation, and analysis of its impact on function, has been hampered by the technical difficulty of large-scale but accurate typing of genomic copy number. The copy-variable <b>alpha-defensin</b> locus DEFA 1 A 3 on human chromosome 8 commonly varies between 4 and 10 copies per diploid genome, and presents considerable challenges for accurate high-throughput typing. Results: In this study, we developed two paralogue ratio tests and three allelic ratio measurements that, in combination, provide an accurate and scalable method for measurement of DEFA 1 A 3 gene number. We combined information from different measurements in a maximum-likelihood framework which suggests that most samples can be assigned to an integer copy number with high confidence, and applied it to typing 589 unrelated European DNA samples.

In addition to the mutagenic ability and known toxicity of conventional anti-amoebic drugs, there are reports indicating the emergence of treatment failures to these drugs.

Herein, we present the amoebicidal efficacy of cryptdin- 2, a Paneth cell <b>alpha-defensin</b> against E. histolytica.

We conducted population-based association studies to test whether <b>alpha-defensin</b> and beta-defensin polymorphisms influenced smokers' susceptibility to lung function decline and susceptibility to lower respiratory infection in two groups of white participants in the Lung Health Study (275 = fast decline in lung function and 304 = no decline in lung function). Methods Subjects were genotyped for the alpha-defensin- 1 /alpha-defensin- 3 copy number polymorphism and four beta-defensin- 1 polymorphisms (G- 20 A, C- 44 G, G- 52 A and Val 38 Ile). Results There were no associations between individual polymorphisms or imputed haplotypes and rate of decline in lung function or susceptibility to infection. Conclusion These findings suggest that, in a white population, the defensin polymorphisms tested may not be of importance in determining who develops abnormally rapid lung function decline or is susceptible to developing lower respiratory infections. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAIM: To {{identify}} {{changes in}} the salivary protein/peptide profiles by differential proteomics in obese patients with or without periodontitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Periodontal examinations and whole saliva samples were obtained from 38 obese patients (mean age: 45. 1  ±  7. 3  years, mean BMI: 49. 3  ±  9  kg/m(2)) including 13 periodontitis and 25 non-periodontitis subjects, and 19 healthy controls (mean age: 44. 2  ±  6. 4  years, mean BMI: 21. 5  ±  2. 1  kg/m(2)). Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) {{was used to compare}} the whole saliva polypeptide profiles. RESULTS: The SELDI-TOF-MS analysis detected eight putative markers. Six of them were increased and identified in obese subjects versus controls (albumin, α and β haemoglobin chains, α-defensins 1, 2 and 3). <b>Alpha-defensins</b> were less abundant in saliva of periodontitis obese patients (36. 47  ±  19. 84  μA) versus non-periodontitis obese patients (43. 44  ±  30. 34 μA), whereas α-defensins were more abundant in obese patients (40. 99  ±  26. 66 μA) versus controls (27. 1  ±  23. 98 μA). CONCLUSIONS: Periodontal status modifies the salivary proteome in obese patients. <b>Alpha-defensins</b> {{may play a role in}} gingival inflammation, and be involved in the higher susceptibility of obese patients to periodontal diseases...|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} defense molecules secreted by Paneth {{cells are}} <b>alpha-defensins,</b> which {{are known as}} cryptdins in mice. These peptides have hydrophobic and positively charged domains that can interact with phospholipids in cell membranes. This structure allows defensins to insert into membranes, where they {{interact with one another}} to form pores that disrupt membrane function, leading to cell lysis. Due to the higher concentration of negatively charged phospholipids in bacterial than vertebrate cell membranes, defensins preferentially bind to and disrupt bacterial cells, sparing the cells they are functioning to protect.|$|R
40|$|Vgamma 9 Vdelta 2 T cells {{display a}} broad {{antimicrobial}} activity by directly killing infected cells and by inducing an effective adaptive immune response. The activation of Vgamma 9 Vdelta 2 T cells by aminobisphosphonate {{drugs such as}} zoledronic acid (ZOL) results in a massive release of cytokines and chemokines that may induce a bystander activation of other immune cells. The aim of this work was to evaluate the ability of soluble factors released by ZOL-activated Vgamma 9 Vdelta 2 T cells to induce granulocyte activation. We showed that soluble factors released by ZOL-stimulated Vgamma 9 Vdelta 2 T cells activate granulocytes by inducing their chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and <b>alpha-defensins</b> release. Proteomic analysis allowed us to identify a number of cytokines and chemokines specifically released by activated Vgamma 9 Vdelta 2 T cells. Moreover, MCP- 2 depletion by neutralizing Ab revealed a critical role of this chemokine in induction of granulocyte <b>alpha-defensins</b> release. Altogether, these data show a Vgamma 9 Vdelta 2 -mediated activation of granulocytes through a bystander mechanism, and confirm the wide ability of Vgamma 9 Vdelta 2 T-lymphocytes in orchestrating the immune response. In conclusion, an immune modulating strategy targeting Vgamma 9 Vdelta 2 T cells may represent a key switch to induce an effective and well-coordinated immune response, and can be proposed {{as a way to}} strengthen the immune competence during infectious diseases...|$|R
