40|$|Abstract Background Dealing {{with high}} {{dimensional}} markers, such as gene expression data obtained using microarray chip technology or genomics studies, {{is a key}} challenge because the numbers of features greatly exceeds the number of biological samples. After selecting biologically relevant genes, how to summarize the expression of selected genes and then further build predicted model {{is an important issue}} in medical applications. One intuitive method of addressing this challenge assigns different weights to different features, subsequently combining this information into a single score, named the compound covariate. Investigators commonly employ this score to assess whether an association exists between the compound covariate and clinical outcomes adjusted for baseline covariates. However, we found that some clinical papers concerned with such analysis report bias p-values based on flawed compound covariate in their training data set. Results We correct this flaw in the analysis and we also propose treating the compound score <b>as</b> <b>a</b> random <b>covariate,</b> to achieve more appropriate results and significantly improve study power for survival outcomes. With this proposed method, we thoroughly assess the performance of two commonly used estimated gene weights through simulation studies. When the sample size is 100, and censoring rates are 50 %, 30 %, and 10 %, power is increased by 10. 6 %, 3. 5 %, and 0. 4 %, respectively, by treating the compound score <b>as</b> <b>a</b> random <b>covariate</b> rather than <b>a</b> fixed <b>covariate.</b> Finally, we assess our proposed method using two publicly available microarray data sets. Conclusion In this article, we correct this flaw in the analysis and the propose method, treating the compound score <b>as</b> <b>a</b> random <b>covariate,</b> can achieve more appropriate results and improve study power for survival outcomes. </p...|$|R

40|$|Discusses the {{relationship}} between the Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery (HRNTB) and the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery (LNNB), examining the role of intelligence and related factors in this relationship. The problems with using a postmorbid IQ <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>covariate</b> in assessing {{the relationship}} between 2 neuropsychological tests are discussed. Such a procedure corrects for degree and severity of brain injury in addition to premorbid levels of intelligence. Alternative measures such as education are suggested, which can be employed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>covariate</b> controlling for premorbid intelligence. The changes in findings that occur using education <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>covariate</b> are demonstrated.

30|$|Empirical studies often {{pass over}} the survey design and the {{sampling}} weights. There are however two ways of incorporating sampling weights when estimating the propensity score.

40|$|A {{key issue}} in the {{analysis}} of outcome trials is the adjustment for baseline covariates that influence the primary outcome. Imbalance of <b>an</b> important <b>covariate</b> between treatment groups at baseline is of considerable concern if one treatment group is favored over another with respect to the hypothesis testing outcome. With the use of the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study database <b>as</b> <b>an</b> example, the influence of baseline proteinuria on the primary composite endpoint, ESRD, and ESRD or death after adjusting for baseline proteinuria <b>as</b> <b>a</b> continuous <b>covariate</b> was examined. Increasing baseline proteinuria was associated with increased risk for renal events, confirming that proteinuria is <b>an</b> important <b>covariate</b> for renal outcomes. When the randomization was stratified according proteinuria = 2000 mg/g, within the higher proteinuria stratum (>= 2000 mg/g), patients in the losartan group had a higher baseline mean proteinuria value. When the imbalance was adjusted, an increase in the magnitude and the significance of the risk reduction with losartan for each outcome was observed. No apparent interaction between treatment effect and baseline proteinuria was found, and there was no heterogeneity in the treatment response in patients with different baseline proteinuria levels. After proteinuria was adjusted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> continuous variable, greater treatment effects were observed in the RENAAL study. This effect was due solely to the imbalance in baseline proteinuria. Considering the importance of proteinuria <b>as</b> <b>a</b> risk factor, adjustment for baseline proteinuria <b>as</b> <b>a</b> continuous <b>covariate</b> should be prespecified in the design and analysis of clinical trials involving renal outcomes, even when patients are stratified on the basis of level of proteinuria...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} different statistical approaches in finding {{a statistically significant difference}} in plaque removal efficiency between brushes in clinical trials. Materials and Methods: The approaches, which are evaluated, concern the scores after brushing only, the difference in scores before and after brushing and the relative difference scores (i. e. score before minus score after brushing divided by the score before brushing). In each case the scores before brushing may be included <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>covariate.</b> Except for the relative difference scores, the power of the test statistics of the approaches has been compared by assuming a simple statistical model. These theoretical results have been compared with the numerical results of two particular clinical trials - one with a between-subject design and one with a within-subject design. Results: The numerical results of these clinical trials show that the calculated p-values support the conclusions drawn from the statistical model, i. e. the power of the F-test is highest when evaluating the data after brushing with the data before brushing included <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>covariate.</b> Using the differences in scores before and after brushing - again with the data before brushing <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>covariate</b> - does not add additional power to the test. Omitting the data before brushing <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>covariate</b> only gives satisfactory results when the variance over the subjects or the error variance is zero, which in general is not the case. Conclusions: This investigation reveals that in general the approach of analysing the scores after brushing with the scores before brushing <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>covariate</b> yields the highest chance of finding a statistically significant difference between two brushes. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2005...|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> {{time-varying}} <b>covariate</b> (also called time-dependent <b>covariate)</b> is <b>a</b> {{term used}} in statistics, particularly in survival analyses. It reflects the phenomenon that <b>a</b> <b>covariate</b> {{is not necessarily}} constant through the whole study. For instance, if one wishes to examine the link between area of residence and cancer, this would be {{complicated by the fact}} that study subjects move from one area to another. The area of residency could then be introduced in the statistical model <b>as</b> <b>a</b> time-varying <b>covariate.</b> In survival analysis, this would be done by splitting each study subject into several observations, one for each area of residence. For example, if a person is born at time 0 in area A, moves to area B at time 5, and is diagnosed with cancer at time 8, two observations would be made. One with a length of 5 (5 − 0) in area A, and one with a length of 3 (8 − 5) in area B.|$|R
40|$|Many {{different}} methods {{are used to}} disaggregate census data and predict population densities to construct finer scale, gridded population data sets. These methods often involve a range of high resolution geospatial covariate datasets on aspects such as urban areas, infrastructure, land cover and topography; such covariates, however, are not directly indicative {{of the presence of}} people. Here we tested the potential of geo-located tweets from the social media application, Twitter, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>covariate</b> in the production of population maps. The density of geo-located tweets in 1 x 1 km grid cells over a 2 -month period across Indonesia, a country with one of the highest Twitter usage rates in the world, was input <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>covariate</b> into a previously published random forests-based census disaggregation method.
