50|$|When used in {{its most}} common application, for {{conversion}} of an alternating current (<b>AC)</b> <b>input</b> into a direct current (DC) output, it {{is known as a}} bridge rectifier. A bridge rectifier provides full-wave rectification from a two-wire <b>AC</b> <b>input,</b> resulting in lower cost and weight as compared to a rectifier with a 3-wire input from a transformer with a center-tapped secondary winding.|$|R

50|$|The Rectiverter {{works as}} a {{rectifier}} if AC voltage is present at the <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> port and <b>AC</b> output port is disabled/not connected. Energy is transferred from <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> port to the DC port. The load on the DC port can be either a battery {{that needs to be}} charged and or other DC loads. A typical load can be -48 V telecom equipment.|$|R
50|$|In other words, if the {{operator}} disconnects the <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> source from the system, {{he or she}} shall be assured {{that there is no}} hazardous AC voltage being fed back from the AC output. If {{the operator}} accidentally shorts the AC output to the <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> terminals of the Rectiverter, the Rectiverters turns off, and no hazardous voltage will be present at the input.|$|R

50|$|A Rectiverter will {{reconnect}} to AC mains {{and start}} to draw power from the <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> port once mains voltage has recovered to normal after an abnormal condition.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{intrinsic}} operating constraints of a single-phase semi-bridge rectifier, {{and the impact}} of this constraint on its <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> current distortion in continuous conduction mode. A detailed analytical expression is developed for the <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> current under this constraint, incorporating second order effects such as supply voltage harmonics and semiconductor voltage-drops. The result is then used to identify the theoretical input THD limits for the semi-bridge rectifier in this operating mode as converter parameters are varied. Matching theoretical, simulation, and experimental results are presented to validate the analysis...|$|R
50|$|Rectiverter {{operation}} {{means that}} power {{is transferred from}} <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> port to both AC output and DC port simultaneously. The Rectiverter can supply both an AC load and DC load in this mode of operation.|$|R
5000|$|A valley-fill circuit {{is a type}} {{of passive}} power factor {{correction}} (PFC) circuit.For purposes of illustration, a basic full-wave diode-bridge rectifier is shown in the first stage, which converts the <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> voltage to a DC voltage.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{alternating}} current (AC) flows very well through the capacitor, almost {{as well as}} it flows through solid wire, <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> flows out through the capacitor, effectively short circuiting to ground (analogous to replacing the capacitor with just a wire).|$|R
5000|$|In: Line-level. The <b>input</b> <b>socket</b> is {{a stereo}} <b>socket,</b> and can <b>input</b> two {{channels}} of a stereo signal—however, these are mixed and only {{accessible to the}} hardware as a combined mono 8-bit signal. An Apple PlainTalk Microphone provides line-level input by using a longer 4-contact plug which receives power from a 5 V supply within the input jack. Other microphones only give a mic-level input, and do not work with the Quadra 605.|$|R
50|$|For many applications, {{especially}} with single phase AC where the full-wave bridge serves to convert an <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> into a DC output, {{the addition of}} a capacitor may be desired because the bridge alone supplies an output of pulsed DC (see diagram to right).|$|R
40|$|Energy {{saving and}} {{different}} working voltage applications are widely employing matrix converters. Matrix converters {{are used to}} convert three phase <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> voltages to three phase AC output voltages of required magnitude and frequency. Pulse width modulation is a technique used for converting three phase <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> to three phase AC output. In this research paper, pulse width modulation based matrix converter will be designed to acquire voltage of desired magnitude and frequency. Voltage transfer ratio will be maximized in this technique so that any desired voltage magnitude could be achieved. Secondly, harmonics will be made reduced in this design. Simulations will be performed in Matlab and characteristics of output waveform will be observed with respect to characteristics of input waveforms...|$|R
50|$|The {{quick trip}} pulse is {{available}} in AC/AC mode, and DC/AC mode of operation, meaning {{that it is a}} property of the AC output port only. Regardless if the energy is supplied from the <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> port or the DC port, the quick trip is available.|$|R
50|$|The Rectiverter can {{withstand}} overvoltages on the <b>input</b> <b>AC</b> port for long time. Although {{not intended to}} work >275VAC it {{can withstand}} continuous overvoltages substantially higher than 275VAC. This is possible due to the built in relay which disconnects the <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> power stage at an overvoltage condition. The AC output will be maintained during an AC mains overvoltage condition as the Rectiverter runs in inverter mode supplying energy to the load from the batteries.|$|R

The distribution unit contains a controller, I/O units and DIN rails for holding AC and DC distribution MCBs, battery connections and battery MCBs, as well as screw terminal <b>sockets</b> for <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> and DC bus connections.|$|R
50|$|All the Series 3 {{variants}} were {{powered by}} two AA battery cells which are easily obtainable, {{rather than having}} a specially shaped proprietary battery which might be difficult to replace. They all have an internal backup battery {{in the form of}} an easily changed small button cell, which enables the main AA batteries to be changed without losing any of the data files. In addition they all have a DC <b>input</b> <b>socket</b> for optional external power-supply via a mains transformer.|$|R
50|$|The Rectiverter has a PFC {{stage at}} the <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> port. Harmonic {{distortion}} of load currents at the AC-output port caused by non-linear loads will therefore not be reflected to the grid. The Rectiverter will always act as a linear, resistive load to the grid when operating at maximum load.|$|R
50|$|Mains {{electricity}} differ between {{regions in}} the world. A Rectiverter is factory pre-set to either nominal 115VAC or 230VAC input and output voltage. Note that the Rectiverter has wide <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> voltage and frequency ranges which {{make it possible to}} use the Rectiverter in a majority of countries/regions of the world.|$|R

The tunable oscillator/resonator can be a MEMS/NEMS resonator. Switching of {{one or both of the}} first or second logic inputs on or off in association with the tuning of the <b>AC</b> <b>input</b> (206) can provide logic gate operation. The device can easily be extended to a 3 -bit or n-bit device by providing additional logic inputs.
