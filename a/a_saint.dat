5|$|Eleanor {{probably}} {{hoped that}} Henry would be recognised as <b>a</b> <b>saint,</b> as his contemporary Louis IX of France had been; indeed, Henry's final tomb resembled {{the shrine of}} <b>a</b> <b>saint,</b> complete with niches possibly intended to hold relics. When the King's body was exhumed in 1290, contemporaries noted that the body was in perfect condition and that Henry's long beard remained well preserved, {{which at the time}} was considered to be an indication of saintly purity. Miracles began to be reported at the tomb, but Edward was sceptical about these stories. The reports ceased, and Henry was never canonised. In 1292 Henry's heart was removed from his tomb and reburied at Fontevraud Abbey with the bodies of his Angevin family.|$|E

5|$|Paulinus died on 10 October 644 at Rochester, {{where he}} {{was buried in the}} sacristy of the church. His {{successor}} at Rochester was Ithamar, the first Englishman consecrated to a Gregorian missionary see.
