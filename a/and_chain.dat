5|$|Players {{control a}} monocle- and pith helmet–wearing Velociraptor driving a jeep. The {{aim of the}} game is to attain a high score by {{performing}} stunts, damaging the jeep during collisions, collecting orbs, and killing the other Velociraptor which run around the area. The vehicle is equipped with a spiked ball <b>and</b> <b>chain</b> which can be deployed from the tailgate as many times as the player wishes. Deploying the spiked ball increases the difficulty of maneuvering the vehicle. The ball can be released from the chain at any time, if done so during a turn the weapon is launched forward. Players kill other Velociraptor by ramming them with the jeep or crushing them with the spiked ball which is dragged behind the vehicle. Slain dinosaurs can be dragged to exporters by the spiked ball <b>and</b> <b>chain</b> to gain extra points. Exporters are teleporting devices which transport the slain dinosaurs to the future.|$|E

5|$|A second woodcut was {{executed}} by Hans Burgkmair in Augsburg {{around the same}} time as Dürer's in Nuremberg. Burgkmair corresponded with merchants in Lisbon and Nuremberg, {{but it is not clear}} whether he had access to a letter or sketch as Dürer did, perhaps even Dürer's sources, or saw the animal himself in Portugal. His image is truer to life, omitting Dürer's more fanciful additions and including the shackles <b>and</b> <b>chain</b> used to restrain the rhinoceros; however, Dürer's woodcut is more powerful and eclipsed Burgkmair's in popularity. Only one impression (example) of Burgkmair's image has survived, whereas Dürer's print survives in many impressions. Dürer produced a first edition of his woodcut in 1515, in the first state, which is distinguished by only five lines of text in the heading. Many further printings followed after Dürer's death in 1528, including two in the 1540s, and two more in the late 16th century. Later printings have six lines of descriptive text.|$|E

Senators Nunn and Cohen also felt strongly that the Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats. Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed a clearer organizational focus <b>and</b> <b>chain</b> of command for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts.|$|E

White suckers and brown trout occurred at 80 percent of the sites, longnose dace occurred at 70 percent of the sites, cutlips minnows occurred at 65 percent of the sites, and bluegills occurred at 60 percent of the sites. Fallfish, golden shiners, yellow bullheads, and American eels were all historically observed in the watershed, but were not found during the survey. However, redside dace, creek chubsuckers, green sunfish, and fathead minnows were observed in the watershed for the first time during the 2003/2004 survey. The most common game species was wild brown trout, although smaller numbers of brook trout were observed as well.

A memorial tablet to James was erected in 1933 in the chapel of Rossall School; it was unveiled by Lord Derby, president of the Rossall School Corporation. A oak chancel screen was also erected as a memorial to James in St Mary's Church, Panteg, with the unveiling in 1935 being carried out by Lord Trevethin, a friend of James since childhood. Rugby School erected the James Pavilion in his memory, which was opened in 1937 with Sir Pelham Warner, an Old Rugbeian, paying tribute to James's love of cricket.|$|E
5|$|Making several {{attempts}} to close on Endymion, Decatur discovered that Presidents damage limited her maneuverability, allowing Endymion to anticipate, and draw away from, positions favorable for boarding. Faced {{with this new}} dilemma, Decatur ordered bar <b>and</b> <b>chain</b> shot fired to disable Endymions sails and rigging, the idea being to shake his pursuer and allow President to proceed to a safe port without being followed. At noon, Endymion, being the much better sailer, was close-hauled, outpacing her squadron and leaving them behind. At 2pm, she gained on President and took position on the American ship's quarter, shooting into President {{as she tried to}} escape. Endymion was able to rake President three times and did considerable damage to her; by contrast, President primarily directed her fire at Endymion's rigging in order to slow her down during the two-hour engagement.|$|E
