40|$|Imidazolylpropylguanidines {{derived from}} {{impromidine}} and <b>arpromidine</b> are more potent and efficacious agonists at the guinea pig histamine H₂ receptor (gpH₂R) {{than at the}} human H₂R (hH₂R) in the GTPase assay. Additionally, such guanidines are histamine H₁ receptor (H₁R) antagonists with preference for the human relative to the guinea pig receptor. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine structure-activity relationships of guanidines at human and guinea pig H₁R and H₂R species isoforms expressed in Sf 9 insect cells. Three impromidine analogues and six <b>arpromidine</b> analogues exhibited agonistic activity at H₂R and antagonistic activity at H₁R as assessed in the steady-state GTPase assay. Species selectivity of derivatives was similar as compared with the parent compounds. None of the structural modifications examined (different aromatic ring systems and different ring substituents) was superior in terms of H₂R potency and efficacy relative to impromidine and <b>arpromidine,</b> respectively. These data point to substantial structural constraints at the agonist binding site of H₂R. Guanidines exhibited distinct structure-activity relationships for H₁R antagonism in a radioligand competition binding assay and the GTPase assay and for H₁R inverse agonism. Our data indicate that it is difficult to obtain guanidine-type agonists with high potency and high efficacy for hH₂R, but those compounds may be useful tools for exploring the antagonist binding site and constitutive activity of H₁...|$|E

Starting from the potent histamine H 2 agonist and weak NPY Y 1 antagonist <b>arpromidine,</b> 16 imidazolylpropylguanidine derivatives were synthesized and tested for Y 1 antagonistic activity (inhibition of NPY-stimulated Ca 2 + increase in human erythroleukemic cells), where the pheniramine-like moiety of <b>arpromidine</b> was replaced with 2 -pyridylaminoalkyl, benzyl-(2 -pyridyl) aminoalkyl, and phenyl-(2 -pyridyl) alkylaminoalkyl partial structures derived from mepyramine. The pA 2 values {{of the most active}} compounds are in the range of 6. 2 - 6. 5. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) were investigated by fragment regression analysis. Results indicate that a tetramethylene spacer between the guanidino group and the amino nitrogen is optimal. For an at least moderate degree of Y 1 antagonistic activity, a second benzyl or phenyl group must be present in addition to the 2 -pyridyl ring. At this second group, hydrophobic substituents such as 3, 4 -di-CI and 4 -Br further enhance Y 1 antagonism. The most active derivative additionally bears a 5 -Br substituent at the 2 -pyridyl moiety. Structure-activity relationships suggest that the compounds might be able to partially imitate the role of NPY when interacting with Y 1 receptors and thus behave as moderate non-peptide NPY Y 1 antagonist...|$|E

40|$|The {{histamine}} H 2 receptor (H 2 R) is a {{biogenic amine}} receptor {{that belongs to}} the class 1 of G protein coupled receptors (GPCR). N-[3 -(1 H-imidazol- 4 -yl) propyl]guanidines such as <b>arpromidine</b> are the most potent H 2 R agonists known so far. Such compounds might be useful as positive inotropic drugs. Recently, less basic N-acylated derivatives with improved pharmacokinetic properties, i. e. oral bioavailability and the capability of penetrating across the blood-brain barrier, have been developed. Guanidines and N-acylguanidines are more potent and efficacious agonists at the guinea pig (gp) than at the human (h) H 2 R. The aim of this thesis was to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying distinct functions of H 2 R species isoforms. Structural models of the hH 2 R and the gpH 2 R were expected to {{provide insight into the}} binding mode of guanidine-type agonists and to explore the molecular basis for the species-selectivity of these agonists. Predictions emerging from molecular modelling provided a working hypothesis for subsequent experimental molecular pharmacological studies. Three-dimensional homology models of the hH 2 R and the gpH 2 R were generated using the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin as template (chapter 4). With these models, conserved intramolecular interactions were reproduced according to present concepts of GPCR structure. Analysis of the binding site predicted amino acids within the transmembrane (TM) spanning domains TM 2, TM 3, TM 5, TM 6, and TM 7, as well as Lys- 173 and Lys- 175 of the second extracellular loop (e 2) for interactions with guanidine-type agonists. An interaction between the non-conserved Tyr- 17 in TM 1 and Asp- 271 in TM 7 exclusively occurring in the gpH 2 R model was proposed to determine the species-selectivity of the compounds which has been confirmed experimentally by site-directed mutagenesis (chapter 8). A virtual screening approach with the program LUDI resulted in the development of alkyl-branched N-(phenylalkanoyl) guanidines with enhanced potencies at the hH 2 R. The hH 2 R model was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations both in its ligand-free form and in complex with <b>arpromidine</b> (chapter 5). A hydrated 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphatidylcholine bilayer was added to the model to realistically simulate the membrane environment of the receptor. The selective formation and deletion of interactions dependent on {{the presence or absence of}} <b>arpromidine</b> in the binding pocket was proposed to represent perturbations that are necessary for the transition from an inactive towards an active receptor state. The results from the simulations helped on further refining dynamic models of the binding mode of guanidine-type agonists. In the experimental part H 2 R species isoforms of human, guinea pig, rat, and canine were pharmacologically characterized (chapter 7). Fusion proteins of the H 2 R and the short splice variant of Gs-alpha (GsaS) were recombinantly expressed in Sf 9 insect cells. In a steady-state GTPase activity assay only the canine H 2 R exhibited an increased level of constitutive activity compared to the hH 2 R. Moreover, in membranes expressing fused and non-fused receptors the highest basal and GTP-dependent increases in adenylyl cyclase activity were observed with the canine H 2 R. From H 2 R modelling, the increased constitutive activity of the canine H 2 R was suggested to be due to a lack of a putative intramolecular interaction with the non-conserved Arg- 228 stabilizing an inactive receptor state. To investigate a potential impact of e 2 on the species-selectivity of guanidine-type agonists, an hH 2 R-GsaS fusion protein with the four amino acids in e 2 differing in human and guinea pig mutated into the gpH 2 R sequence, and a gpH 2 R-GsaS protein with the corresponding point mutations into the hH 2 R sequence, were generated (chapter 9). Efficacies and potencies of agonists were similar at mutant and wild-type receptors indicating that e 2 does not contribute to the species-selectivity. With two additional mutant hH 2 R-GsaS proteins bearing single point mutations of Lys- 173 to Ala and Lys- 175 to Ala, respectively, agonist activities remained unchanged, suggesting that both amino acids do not participate in direct ligand-receptor interactions. Taken together, the complementary application of three-dimensional structural models and molecular pharmacological studies provided striking insight into specific functions of H 2 R species isoforms and their selective interactions with guanidine-type agonists and will facilitate a further development of more potent and selective agonists for the human H 2 R. Moreover, results from these studies are not restricted to the H 2 R subclass but should also apply to other members of the G protein coupled receptor family...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} evidence that histamine receptor stimulation might be an interesting aspect {{for the development of}} future drugs as well. <b>Arpromidine</b> and related imidazolylpropylguanidines are the most potent H 2 R agonists on the isolated guinea pig right atrium. The strongly basic guanidino group is essential for the agonistic activity but it is also responsible for very low oral bioavailability, non-H 2 R-mediated effects and lack of penetration across the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, the objective of this work was to design, synthesize and characterize histamine H 2 receptor agonists, structurally related to <b>arpromidine,</b> but with lower basicity in order to achieve more favourable pharmacokinetic properties, in particular, oral bioavailability and penetration across the blood-brain barrier. The first part of this project was to develop a general synthetic route for the synthesis of NG-acylated imidazolylpropylguanidines. In Chapter 3, the development of a very convenient and straight forward synthetic route is described for the synthesis of NG-acylated guanidines, from the commercially available starting material, urocanic acid and guanidine, followed by coupling of acids. Then the synthesised compounds were pharmacologically tested on isolated guinea pig tissues (ileum: H 1 R, H 3 R; right atrium: H 2 R), on human H 1 R expressing cells (U 373 MG) and on membrane preparations of guinea pig and human histamine H 2 or H 4 receptor expressing Sf 9 cells. The basicity of the acylguanidines is by 4 - 5 orders of magnitude lower than that of the corresponding guanidines. Acyl and alkyl guanidines are about equipotent as, for instance, demonstrated for the diphenylpropyl versus the diphenylpropanoyl and for impromidine versus the oxo-substituted analogue. Surprisingly, compounds with only one phenyl ring are equally or even more potent than the diaryl analogues. On the isolated guinea pig right atrium the most active H 2 R agonist, the 3 -phenylbutanoyl substituted guanidine was about 30 times more potent than the natural ligand. However, the acylated imidazolylpropylguanidines are superior with respect to pharmacokinetic properties. A very important finding is that the compounds are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are capable of penetrating through the blood-brain barrier. Centrally active H 2 R agonists will be useful pharmacological tools to study the role histamine H 2 receptors in the brain. In Chapter 4, the bioisosteric replacement of the imidazolyl moiety in NG-acylated guanidine-type histamine H 2 receptor agonists by a 2 -amino- 4 -methylthiazol- 5 -yl group resulted in about the same H 2 R agonistic potency on the isolated guinea pig right atrium as well as in GTPase assays. Interestingly, in the GTPase assay on the human H 2 R the thiazolyl analogue with cyclohexylbutanoyl substituent was favoured compared to the corresponding phenylbutanoylguanidine. This may be interpreted a hint that a certain degree of selectivity for the human H 2 R may be achieved by structural variation of both the acyl and the heterocyclylpropyl group. Moreover, the aminothiazoles proved to be devoid of H 3 R antagonistic activity. Thus, the selectivity for H 2 R versus H 3 R can be considerably improved. In Chapter 5, the stereoselective preparation of enantiomers of several chiral new H 2 R agonists is described. The building block (R and S) - 3 -phenylbutanoic acid was synthesized from the achiral precursor, methyl (E) -but- 2 -enoate, via asymmetric conjugate addition of phenylboronic acid by using a catalytic amount of rhodium catalyst and chiral binap ligand, followed by hydrolysis of the methyl ester. The corresponding chiral pyridyl acids with high ee (95 - 99...|$|E
40|$|Impromidine (IMP) and <b>arpromidine</b> (ARP) -derived guanidines {{are more}} potent and efficacious guinea pig (gp) {{histamine}} H 2 -receptor (gpH 2 R) than human (h) H 2 R agonists and histamine H 1 -receptor (H 1 R) antagonists with preference for hH 1 R relative to gpH 1 R. We examined NG-acylated imidazolylpropylguanidines (AIPGs), which are less basic than guanidines, at hH 2 R, gpH 2 R, rat H 2 R (rH 2 R), hH 1 R, and gpH 1 R expressed in Sf 9 cells as probes for ligand-specific receptor conformations. AIPGs were similarly potent H 2 R agonists as the corresponding guanidines IMP and ARP, respectively. Exchange of pyridyl in ARP against phenyl increased AIPG potency 10 -fold, yielding {{the most potent}} agonists at the hH 2 R-Gs fusion protein and gpH 2 R-Gs identified so far. Some AIPGs were similarly potent and efficacious at hH 2 R-Gs and gpH 2 R-Gs. AIPGs stabilized the ternary complex in hH 2 R-Gs and gpH 2 R-Gs differently than the corresponding guanidines. Guanidines, AIPGs, and small H 2 R agonists exhibited distinct agonist properties at hH 2 R, gpH 2 R, and rH 2 R measuring adenylyl cyclase activity. In contrast to ARP and IMP, AIPGs were partial H 1 R agonists exhibiting higher efficacies at hH 1 R than at gpH 1 R. This is remarkable because, so far, all bulky H 1 R agonists exhibited higher efficacies at gpH 1 R than at hH 1 R. Collectively, our data suggest that AIPGs stabilize different active conformations in hH 2 R, gpH 2 R, and rH 2 R than guanidines and that, in contrast to guanidines, AIPGs are capable of stabilizing a partially active state of hH 1 R...|$|E
40|$|For the {{discovery}} and detailed pharmacological characterisation of new ligands of G-protein coupled receptors simple, robust and reliable in vitro assays using whole cells are required. This thesis {{aimed at the}} development of new binding and functional assays for the human histamine H 1, H 2 and H 4 receptor (hH 1 R, hH 2 R, hH 4 R), respectively. Whereas the ratiometric fura- 2 based calcium assay in cuvettes has been state of the art for the determination of intracellular calcium for decades, non-ratiometric dyes like fluo- 4 are preferred in high throughput screening. In order to combine the advantages of ratiometric calcium measurements with increased throughput in the microplate format, hH 1 R expressing U- 373 MG cells were used as a model. The characterisation of the agonist histamine yielded reliable data both in 96 -well and 384 -well plates. The determination of antagonistic activity was most effective in the 384 -well format and validated using standard H 1 R antagonists. Sequential reduction of the measurement time enabled the characterisation of 480 samples in one assay per day in the 384 -well format. As a proof-of-concept, the applicability of this approach was confirmed by the identification of potent hH 1 R antagonists as lead compounds from a library of more than thousand new chemical entities. Due to the lack of appropriate wild-type cells expressing the hH 2 R or the hH 4 R, HEK 293 cells were investigated for their suitability to express those receptor subtypes both on the mRNA level and by Western blot. Although a band corresponding to the hH 2 R was identified by mRNA analysis, the respective receptor protein was not detected in Western blots. Therefore, HEK 293 cells were considered appropriate for the expression of human histamine receptor subtypes. To establish a functional assay, HEK 293 cells were stably co-transfected with the hH 2 R and the chimeric G-protein qs 5 -HA, thereby redirecting the agonist-mediated receptor stimulation to a robust calcium signal. For validation, radioligand binding experiments were performed comparing the co-transfected cells (HEK 293 -hH 2 R-qs 5 -HA cells) with HEK 293 -FLAG-hH 2 R-His 6 cells as reference. The affinities determined for the investigated standard ligands were on both cell types and on membranes from HEK 293 -hH 2 R-qs 5 -HA cells in the same order of magnitude and mainly in agreement with data reported in literature, except for the H 2 R agonist <b>arpromidine,</b> which showed lower affinity than reported for binding experiments performed in a different model (fusion proteins of the hH 2 R and the short splice variant of Gs-alpha). Generally, the binding properties of the investigated ligands were not significantly influenced by the co-expression of qs 5 -HA in HEK 293 -hH 2 R-qs 5 -HA cells. As an alternative to the use of radioligands, fluorescence-based binding assays were developed. The specific binding of a cyanine-dye-labelled H 2 R antagonist to HEK 293 -hH 2 R-qs 5 -HA cells was visualized by confocal microscopy. In addition, flow cytometric saturation binding experiments were performed on HEK 293 -hH 2 R-qs 5 -HA cells with this cyanine-labelled compound and with a pyrylium(Py) -dye-labelled H 2 R ligand. Although the fluorescent ligands showed moderate submicromolar affinities, these compounds are appropriate for binding assays, since their unspecific binding is extremely low. Affinities determined in binding experiments by displacing the Py-labelled ligand with H 2 R standard ligands were slightly lower for several compounds than reference data from literature, possibly due to the need for DMSO as a co-solvent in the assay. For the determination of the functional activity of hH 2 R ligands, fura- 2 assays were established in cuvettes and in the microtitre format. Data obtained in the fura- 2 assays were in agreement with results reported for calcium measurements performed with fluo- 3 and were essentially in the same order of magnitude as reported for GTPase activity. Preliminary experiments aiming at the development of binding and functional assays for the hH 4 R were performed. Taken together, the established flow cytometric binding assay using fluorescence-labelled ligands and stably co-transfected cells represents an innovative alternative to radioligand binding assays for the determination of ligand affinity on the hH 2 R. The principle of stable co-expression of receptor and chimeric G-protein qs 5 -HA allowed the development of fluorescence-based calcium measurements, which can be performed in the microtitre format, thereby enabling reasonable throughput. The developed methods will contribute to the characterisation of compounds on histamine receptor subtypes with regard to affinity, receptor subtype selectivity, quality of action and potency...|$|E
40|$|Potent and {{selective}} histamine H 2 receptor (H 2 R) agonists are valuable pharmacological tools {{and might be}} of therapeutic value as drugs, for example {{in the treatment of}} severe congestive heart failure. At the beginning of this project <b>arpromidine</b> and related N-[3 -(1 H-imidazol- 4 -yl) propyl]guanidines were known as the most potent H 2 R agonists. Previous studies from our group have shown that the strong basicity of those compounds is considerably reduced by introduction of a carbonyl group adjacent to the guanidine moiety for improved pharmacokinetic properties while the agonistic acitivity is more or less retained. The aim of this thesis was to synthesize and elaborate the structure-activity relationships, in particular to improve the potency and selectivity of acylguanidine-type H 2 R agonists. Therefore, numerous NG-acylated [3 -(1 H-imidazol- 4 -yl) propyl]guanidines and [3 -(2 -amino- 4 -methylthiazol- 5 -yl) propyl]guanidines with different alkanoyl substituents including �bivalent ligands� were prepared and pharmacologically characterized (cooperation with Prof. Dr. S. Elz and Prof. Dr. R. Seifert, University of Regensburg). NG-Acylated [3 -(1 H-imidazol- 4 -yl) propyl]guanidines. The synthesized compounds were investigated for agonism on the guinea pig (gp) right atrium and in a steady-state GTPase activity assay. A methyl or ethyl-branched three-membered alkanoyl chain between the guanidine moiety and an aromatic or alicyclic ring system favours high potency at the gpH 2 R. By contrast, the human (h) H 2 R prefers/tolerates compounds with longer and more ramified NG-alkanoyl chains, presumably due to a more flexible binding pocket. Polar substituents strongly shifted the species selectivity towards gpH 2 R, whereas aliphatic substituents were preferred by the hH 2 R. In accordance with previous data of alkyl- and acylguanidines, most compounds proved to be more potent and efficacious at the gpH 2 R compared to the hH 2 R. Strikingly, also compounds with similar or even slightly higher potency and efficacy at the hH 2 R were found, indicating that, in principle, potent {{and selective}} compounds for the human receptor can be developed. For receptor selectivity, representative compounds were tested at hH 1 R (calcium assay on U- 373 MG cells) as well as on hH 3 R and hH 4 R (GTPase assays on Sf 9 cells). On human U- 373 cells only weak antagonistic activity was found. Surprisingly, several NG-acylated imidazolylpropylguanidines turned out to be potent agonists on the hH 3 R and hH 4 R in the GTPase assay (pEC 50 values around 8 - 9). NG-Acylated [3 -(2 -amino- 4 -methylthiazol- 5 -yl) propyl]guanidines. The bioisosteric replacement of the imidazole against a 2 -amino- 4 -methylthiazole ring led to equipotent or even more potent partial H 2 R agonists and turned out to be key to obtain highly H 2 R-selective agonists, devoid of activity on H 3 R and H 4 R. In contrast to the H 2 R agonist amthamine (2 -amino- 4 -methylthiazol- 5 -ethanamine), the 4 -methyl group in the thiazole ring of acylguanidine-type H 2 R agonists did enhance the agonistic potency neither in the GTPase assay nor at the gp right atrium. �Bivalent� H 2 R agonists. According to the �bivalent ligand approach�, symmetric compounds were synthesized by connecting two hetarylpropylguanidine moieties by NG-acylation with alkanedioic acids of different length. Most strikingly, the combination of two 2 -amino- 4 -methylthiazol- 5 -ylpropylguanidine moieties with an octanedioyl spacer resulted in the most potent agonist at the gp atrium known so far (pEC 50 9. 45; 3000 -fold potency of histamine). This result is in good agreement with the data from the GTPase assay. Elongation of the spacer up to a length predicted to be optimal for binding to receptor dimers (22 - 27 Å) resulted in a dramatic decrease or total loss of H 2 R agonism. The exceptionally high potency of the most prominent bivalent H 2 R agonists can be explained by binding to an additional (allosteric?) binding site at the same receptor molecule rather than by �bridging� of a receptor dimer because of an insufficient spacer length. Further investigations of the bivalent ligands on mutant H 2 R-GsaS fusion proteins (transmembrane domains, e 2 loop) confirmed the key role of the non-conserved Tyr- 17 and Asp- 271 in TM 1 and TM 7 in the gpH 2 R for species-selective H 2 R activation and suggest that the second extracellular loop does not participate in direct ligand-receptor interactions. In conclusion, numerous potent histamine H 2 R agonists were identified among the synthesized NG-acylated hetarylpropylguanidines. A major problem, selectivity for H 2 R over H 3 R and H 4 R, was solved by bioisosteric replacement of the imidazol- 4 -yl with a 2 -amino- 4 -methylthiazol- 5 -yl ring. The most potent and selective H 2 R agonists were obtained according to the bivalent ligand approach by combining two guanidine-type H 2 R agonist pharmacophores by alkanedioic acids. The results of this thesis represent a promising step towards the development of guanidine-type H 2 R agonists for in vivo investigations...|$|E
