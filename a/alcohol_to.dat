5|$|It {{is illegal}} to serve <b>alcohol</b> <b>to</b> anyone under 21, {{encourage}} an underage person to drink, knowingly allow underage drinking on property that one owns or leases, or possess alcoholic beverages on public school property without written consent {{of the school board}} or school principal. State law grants an exemption for religious services, and for parents and guardians over 21 who serve <b>alcohol</b> <b>to</b> their own children in a private location (such as a private home).|$|E
5|$|Federal law {{states that}} {{national}} parks {{will have the}} same underage laws as the state that they are located in, and the Assimilative Crimes Act is applicable to New Jersey's underage drinking statute. Thus, in a private location, such as a cabin in a federal enclave in New Jersey, a parent can serve <b>alcohol</b> <b>to</b> their child, and an underage person can possess and consume alcohol. Outside of these exceptions, underage drinking and serving <b>alcohol</b> <b>to</b> a minor are federal misdemeanors, punishable by a fine and up to 6 months in jail. There is a five-year statute of limitations for DUI, underage drinking, and other alcohol violations that take place in federal enclaves.|$|E
5|$|Narcosis {{is known}} to be {{additive}} to even minimal alcohol intoxication, and also to the effects of other drugs such as cannabis (which is more likely than <b>alcohol</b> <b>to</b> have effects that last into a day of abstinence from use).

5|$|The state underage {{drinking}} {{statute is}} a disorderly persons offense (misdemeanor), which upon conviction is punishable {{by up to}} 6 months in jail (rarely imposed), a $500–$1000 fine, and a mandatory 6-month suspension of the person's driver's license. The penalties are the same for using fake identification. Those who unlawfully serve <b>alcohol</b> <b>to</b> an underage person, entice an underage person to drink, knowingly permit underage drinking on their property, or bring alcohol onto a public school property face similar sanctions, except that their driver's license will not be suspended. A licensed business which serves <b>alcohol</b> <b>to</b> a person under age 21, even unintentionally, may be fined or have their liquor license suspended or revoked.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{repeal of}} Prohibition and {{the passage of}} the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, the ABC issued {{regulations}} that prohibited bars and liquor stores from selling <b>alcohol</b> <b>to</b> a person under 21, which was considered the age of majority at that time. In 1939, it became a criminal offense to sell <b>alcohol</b> <b>to</b> a person under 21, and for a person under 21 to purchase or consume alcohol in a licensed establishment. The state criminalized the underage possession of alcohol in motor vehicles and other public areas in 1957, possibly in response to young New Jerseyans traveling to New York, where the drinking age was 18, and returning home with liquor. For many years laws against underage drinking and the serving of <b>alcohol</b> <b>to</b> minors did not apply on private property, though an adult who supplied a substantial amount of liquor to an underage person could possibly be prosecuted for contributing to the delinquency of a minor Furthermore, arrests and criminal prosecutions for underage drinking in bars or public areas were very uncommon before the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|New Jersey's {{drinking}} age {{was lowered}} to 18 in 1973 {{as part of}} a broader legal change which reduced New Jersey's age of majority from 21 to 18. Much of the impetus for lowering the drinking age to 18 was to grant returning Vietnam veterans the right to purchase alcohol. Possibly because of concerns about 18-year-old high school students being able to legally purchase liquor, and then illegally consume it school, the state raised the drinking age to 19 in 1980. Citing statistics that indicated an increase in car deaths among drivers under 21, the drinking age was raised back to 21 in 1983. At the same time, the penalties for underage drinking were increased to include a mandatory driver's license suspension. In 1985, the state made it illegal for an adult to give <b>alcohol</b> <b>to</b> a person under 21, with exception for religious services and parents serving <b>alcohol</b> <b>to</b> their own children at home or in a private area.|$|E

5|$|The first {{drinking}} age law in New Jersey {{was passed}} in 1846. It allowed {{the parents of a}} student under 21 to sue for up to $10 ($ in modern dollars) in damages against a tavern keeper or shopkeeper who supplied alcoholic beverages to their children. In 1880, a criminal statute was enacted, fining businesses that sold liquor to people under 18 if their parents had told the establishment not to sell to their child. The law was amended in 1888 to eliminate the parental consent provision, thus making it illegal in all cases for a tavern or liquor store to sell <b>alcohol</b> <b>to</b> person under 18. In 1908, the penalties were increased so that a tavern keeper who served a minor could be jailed. Upon the start of Prohibition, New Jersey repealed its laws regarding the sale of <b>alcohol</b> <b>to</b> minors since the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited almost all liquor sales.|$|E

5|$|As Morgan and {{his allies}} on the Assembly of Jamaica {{continued}} to deal with privateers and pirates, criticism of their action in London was fomented by two former governors of Jamaica, Carbery and Lynch. After Lynch paid £50,000 to Charles II, Morgan's commissions as lieutenant-governor and lieutenant-general were revoked and Lynch was appointed as the island's governor; Morgan still retained {{his position on the}} Assembly of Jamaica. Morgan had been a heavy drinker for several years; he received the news of the revocation of his positions badly and increased his intake of <b>alcohol</b> <b>to</b> the point where his health began to suffer. Lynch removed Morgan's supporters from the Assembly of Jamaica by 1683, and in October that year he removed Morgan and his brother-in-law, leaving the assembly packed with men loyal to him. In 1684 Lynch died, and was temporarily replaced as governor by his friend, the lieutenant-general, Hender Molesworth.|$|E
5|$|Bars and {{restaurants}} are considered strictly liable for their patrons' behavior, and liquor licenses can be suspended or revoked if a customer engages in illegal activity (e.g. fighting, public urination) after drinking. New Jersey law recognizes both dram shop liability and social host liability, wherein the server of <b>alcohol</b> <b>to</b> visibly intoxicated persons or minors is liable {{if that person}} then causes death or injury to a third party in an alcohol-related automobile collision or other accident. In order to mitigate liability, the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) grants licensed establishments the right to exclude any patron for any reason, but warns business against violating civil rights laws.|$|E
5|$|During World WarI, the palace, {{then the}} home of King GeorgeV and Queen Mary, escaped unscathed. Its more {{valuable}} contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained in situ.

To the King's later regret, David Lloyd George persuaded him to go further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from <b>alcohol,</b> <b>to</b> set a good example to the supposedly inebriated working class. The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence. In 1938, the north-west pavilion, designed by Nash as a conservatory, was converted into a swimming pool.|$|E
