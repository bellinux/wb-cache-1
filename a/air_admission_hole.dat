40|$|Abstract: Pump {{performance}} characteristics change drastically under two-phase flow conditions {{from those of}} single-phase flow. This {{is due to a}} change in flow characteristics in the impeller. Owing to a positive pres-sure gradient the air bubble moves more slowly than the water in the impeller channel, but in the suction surface region of the impeller inlet, where a negative pressure gradient prevails, the bubbles move more quickly than the water. Thus, in the space just after this region the distributions of the void fraction obtained are considerably higher and uneven. The change in the pressure distribution owing to <b>air</b> <b>admission</b> is also particularly evident in the inlet region of the impeller. These changes bring about an alteration of the whole flow pattern in the impeller and also cause a drop in pump performance. The Reynolds-averaged Navier– Stokes equations for two-phase flow in a centrifugal pump impeller are solved using a finite volume method to obtain the pressure, velocities and void fraction respectively. Good agreement is achieved when the pre-dicted results are compared with those measured experimentally within the range of bubbly flow conditions...|$|R

The paper focusses attention on alternative approaches for treating the coupling between the flow in the annulus supply ducts and the jets which enter combustor primary and dilution zones through <b>air</b> <b>admission</b> ports. Traditionally CFD predictions of combustor flows have modeled this in a very weakly coupled manner, with the port flow conditions being derived from 1 D empirical correlations and used as boundary conditions for an internal-flow-only combustor CFD prediction. Recent work by the authors and others has introduced the viewpoint that fully coupled external-annulus–internal-combustor predictions is the way forward. Experimental data is gathered in the present work to quantify the strength of the interaction between annulus and core flows, which ultimately determines the jet characteristics at port exit. These data are then used to illustrate the improvement in the prediction of port exit jet characteristics which is obtained by adopting fully coupled calculations compared to the internal-flow-only approach. As a final demonstration of the importance of a fully coupled approach, isothermal calculations are presented for a single sector generic annular combustor. These show that quite different primary zone flow patterns are obtained from the two approaches, leading to considerable differences in the overall mixing pattern at combustor exit...|$|R

On films in UHV, only the uniform precession mode was observed during the microwave experiments. Admission of gases such as H 2, H 2 O, O 2, N 2 O, and air caused a lowering of the resonance {{field of the}} uniform precession mode. This effect was interpreted earlier as a relief of compressive stress related to surface tension. After adsorption of gases the films were virtually stress free. In the case of O 2, N 2 O, and <b>air</b> <b>admission</b> a standing spin wave resonance (SWR) mode (p= 1) slowly developed in films thicker than 400 Å after the lowering of the resonance field of the uniform precession mode was observed.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Competitive pressure and stringent emissions legislation have placed an urgent demand on research to improve {{our understanding of the}} gas turbine combustor flow field. Flow through the <b>air</b> <b>admission</b> ports of a combustor plays an essential role in determining the internal flow patterns on which many features of combustor performance depend. This thesis explains how a combination of experimental and computational research has helped improve our understanding, and ability to predict, the flow characteristics of jets entering a combustor. The experiments focused on a simplified generic geometry of a combustor port system. Two concentric tubes, with ports introduced into the inner tube's wall, allowed a set of radially impinging jets to be formed within the inner tube. By investigating the flow with LDA instrumentation and flow visualisation methods a quantitative and qualitative picture of the mean and turbulent flow fields has been constructed. Data were collected from the annulus, port and core regions. These data provide suitable validation information for computational models, allow improved understanding of the detailed flow physics and provide the global performance parameters used traditionally by combustor designers. Computational work focused on improving the port representation within CFD models. This work looked at the effect of increasing the grid refinement, and improving the geometrical representation of the port. The desire to model realistic port features {{led to the development of}} a stand-alone port modelling module. Comparing calculations of plain-circular ports to those for more realistic chuted port geometry, for example, showed that isothermal modelling methods were able to predict the expected changes to the global parameters measured.

Success of stabilisation defined by successful transfer on nHF and clinical measures of stability at admission to NICU, including oxygen requirement, admission temperature, surfactant requirement, short term outcomes and whether infants were sustained on nHF by 72 hours of age. Results. There were 133 eligible babies. 54 were commenced on nHF in the DR (Group A), 47 were stabilised by face mask CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) (Group B), 26 were intubated (Group C); 6 required only minimal respiratory support (Group D). Median maturity varied between the groups (Group A 27 + 5 weeks, Group B 30 weeks, Group C 26 + 2 weeks, Group D 31 + 5). 72 % of Group A and 75 % of Group B remained on nHF for 72 hours (P= 0. 82).

40|$|The paper {{reports the}} {{application}} of LES multi-cycle analysis for the characterization of cycle to cycle variability (hereafter CCV) of a highly downsized DISI engine for sport car applications. The analysis covers several subsequent engine cycles operating the engine at full load, peak power engine speed. Despite the chosen engine operation is usually considered relatively stable, relevant fluctuations were experimentally {{measured in terms of}} in-cylinder pressure evolution and combustion phasing. On one hand, despite the complex architecture of the V- 8 engine, the origin of such CCV is considered to be poorly related to cyclic fluctuations of the gas-dynamics within the intake and exhaust pipes, since acquisitions of the instantaneous pressure traces at both the intake port entrance and exhaust port junction by fast-response pressure measurements over 250 subsequent engine cycles showed almost negligible differences in both amplitude and phasing compared to those within the cylinder. On the other hand, being the combustion affected by a complex chain of preceding factors (<b>air</b> <b>admission</b> during the intake stroke, variations in the residual gas fraction, generation of complex turbulent flow structures, fuel injection and dispersion in the combustion chamber and subsequent mixing, interaction between the spark discharge and the surrounding local flow pattern, etc.) a clear understanding of the actual origin of cyclic variability is far from being trivial. LES CFD simulations can therefore become a very powerful tool to help investigating the possible causes of such cyclic variations, since detailed analyses of both global and local parameters can be carried out on an almost unlimited set of available virtual measurements. In {{the first part of the}} paper, the modeling framework is presented and considerations on the adopted numerical strategy are presented, with particular emphasis on grid size, grid distribution and numerical parameters. Subsequently, LES results are analyzed and discussed in order to understand the cycle-to-cycle variations through the use of correlation coefficients between global/local flow variables in order to highlight the major causes of CCV and establish a possible hierarchy among the analyzed quantities. Finally, criticalities of the currently adopted approach and possible enhancements are briefly discussed at the end of the paper. The results presented in the paper clearly highlight the potential of the modeling methodology to help understanding the origin of CCV as well as to address possible engine optimizations to limit the cyclic dispersion...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} laminar and {{turbulent}} conjugate mixed convection flow and heat transfer in shallow enclosures {{with a series}} of block-like heat generating components is studied numerically for a Reynolds number range of zero (pure natural convection) to typically 106, Grashof number range of zero (pure forced convection) to 1015 and various block-to-fluid thermal conductivity ratios, with air as the working medium. The shallow enclosure has modules consisting of heat generating elements, <b>air</b> <b>admission</b> and exhaust slots. Two problems are considered. In the first problem, the enclosure has free boundaries between the modules and in the second problem, there are partitioning walls between the different modules. The flow and temperature distributions are taken to be two-dimensional. Regions with the same velocity and temperature distributions can be identified assuming repeated placement of the blocks and fluid entry and exit openings at regular distances, neglecting end wall effects. One half of such rectangular region is chosen as the computational domain taking into account the symmetry about the vertical centreline. On the basis of the assumption that mixed convection flow is a superposition of forced convection flow with finite pressure drop and a natural convection flow with negligible pressure drop, the individual flow components are delineated. The Reynolds number is based on forced convection velocity, which can be determined in practice from the fan characteristics. This is believed to be more meaningful unlike the frequently used total velocity based Reynolds number, which does not vanish even in pure natural convection and which makes the fan selection difficult. Present analysis uses three models of turbulence, namely, standard k-ε (referred to as Model- 1), low Reynolds number k-ε (referred to as Model- 2) and an SGS kinetic energy based one equation model (referred to as Model- 3). Results are obtained for aiding and opposing mixed convection, considering also the pure natural and pure forced convection limiting cases. The results show that higher Reynolds numbers tend to create a recirculation region of increasing strength at the core region and that the ranges of Reynolds number beyond which the effect of buoyancy becomes insignificant are identified. For instance, in laminar aiding mixed convection, the buoyancy effects become insignificant beyond a Reynolds number of 500. Results are presented for a number of quantities of interest such as the flow and temperature distributions, local and average Nusselt numbers and the maximum dimensionless temperature in the block. Correlations are constructed from the computed results for the maximum dimensionless temperature, pressure drop across the enclosure and the Nusselt numbers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTwo-stroke engines {{have dropped}} out of the {{automobile}} market for a long time due to severe drawbacks. Unfortunately, the comparison with the performances of four-stroke engines was not in favour of two-stroke ones. Nevertheless, the needs of a more compact engine with a better ratio of the mass and size versus power motivated research efforts {{at the beginning of the}} 90 's. Regrettably, these efforts did not result in commercial success and automobile manufacturers kept four-stroke engine architecture as base architecture. However, the two-stroke engine is a highly favourable concept for downsizing and cost reduction by reducing the number of cylinders without NVH penalties. All that added to the maturity of CFD calculations and the availability of high power electronic for control and fuel injection encouraged the Renault research division to have a closer look into its architecture. The study deals with a two-cylinder Diesel engine based on two-stroke valves engine. <b>Air</b> <b>admission</b> and exhausts gas are done through four valves per cylinder; fuel injection is done through ten holes nozzle at 1800 bar of pressure. The company Delphi, partner of the project, provided the injection system. The displacement of engine is 730 cm 3 and the engine is designed for a range of power of about 35 - 50 kW and a range of torque of 110 – 145 N. m. The design of the scavenging was achieved with the help of 3 D simulation based on the best 3 D simulation tools available. More than 250 calculations were completed to determine the best design of the cylinder-head reaching the objective of scavenging performances. At the end of this step, the best compromise was determined between the mass of fresh gas and the mass of burnt gas in the cylinder respecting combustion and engine efficiency criterias. Air supercharging system was designed in cooperation between the partners Renault, Le Moteur Moderne and University of Technology of Prague. The injection and combustion testing and optimisation were done on a one cylinder engine at CMT, University of Valencia, partner of the project. The set of parameters was explored and optimised to reach the best compromise between the combustion efficiency and the target of pollutant emissions to reach the EURO 6 standards. Finally, the optimisation of the engine, including the air loop system, calibration and control is planed in 2012 and will be done at IFPEN, partner of project. The objectives, the design process, the major technical breakthrough as well as its detailed results will be presented in this paper.

40|$|A common {{phenomenon}} in Francis turbines is draft tube surge. In these fixed-bladed machines, a strong runner outlet swirl can develop under off-design conditions. The {{action of the}} diffuser, {{and in particular the}} draft tube elbow, on the rotating flow field induces synchronous pressure and discharge fluctuations. These low frequency disturbances are of special interest, because they can easily propagate throughout the whole hydraulic system. The dynamic response of the system to the natural excitations can inhibit the normal usage of the powerplant. If the natural excitation occurs at frequencies close to an eigenfrequency of the hydraulic system, an important amplification of the hydraulic fluctuations can be expected. Passive measures, such as <b>air</b> <b>admission</b> or minor design modifications, are commonly taken as a last resort to try to reduce these phenomena. This work explores an active control approach to alleviate the problem. It is shown that the hydroacoustic fluctuations in a hydraulic installation can strongly be reduced by "injecting" the inverse signal of the turbine's natural excitation. While the main theme is the application of the active control approach to improve the operation stability of Francis turbines, the scope of this study is larger and addresses the following scientific topics: Modeling of an hydroelectric installation The dynamic behavior of an installation is studied based on an one-dimensional model. A compilation of the basic modeling tools was done. Using these tools, the dynamic model of a hydraulic installation and an external hydroacoustical source is presented. It is used to explain how the overall hydroacoustic fluctuations can be reduced using a hydraulic exciter mounted in the wall of a draft tube's cone. Improving the operation stability by active control The hydraulic fluctuations associated with off-design operating conditions of Francis turbines are often very periodic and characterized by the presence of a dominant frequency component. The aim is to cancel out this component for which the amplitudes are often excessive. An active control system, composed of a hydraulic exciter and its controller, has been developed for a Francis turbine. The exciter employs a pulsed flow injection in the draft tube to generate an antiexcitation at a given frequency, which is then synchronized with the turbine's natural excitation. A self-tuning extremum control algorithm optimizes the operating parameters of the exciter to minimize the overall fluctuations in the hydraulic installation. Laboratory tests show the efficiency of the active control system. The amplitude of the pressure and discharge fluctuations at the dominant frequency component are reduced to background noise levels. Multiple configurations of the exciter have been tested. A spectral analysis of the pressure fluctuations is presented, the system's energy balance has been performed and the control algorithm of the system is analysed. The energy balance is very encouraging: the exciter system needed only about 1  percent of the hydraulic power of the Francis turbine. Prediction of the operation stability of turbines based on model tests Laboratory tests on a scale model, homologous to the turbine, are an indispensable step {{in the development of a}} hydroelectric powerplant. Unlike the static characteristics, the dynamic behavior of a turbine installation is difficult to predict. An original identification method of the dynamic characteristics of a model turbine is proposed. The method is verified on a theoretical case study and experimentally tested. It constitutes the basis of the prediction of the operation stability of the powerplant based on model tests...|$|R

40|$|Objective: A {{retrospective}} {{review of}} the pattern of obstetric admissions to the general intensive care unit of the National Hospital, Abuja, Nigeria over a 5 year (March 2000 to February 2005) span was carried out. Materials and Methods: The case files and {{the intensive care unit}} records of 54 patients were used to extract the relevant data. Results: The records of 54 obstetric patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) during the study period were reviewed together with 6063 live births, giving an ICU admission rate of 9. 7 / 1000 live births in the hospital. The average age of the patients was 29. 84 years (range 17 - 40). Forty-four (81. 5 %) of the patients had eclampsia, five patients (9. 3 %) had severe pre-eclampsia. Two patients (5. 55 %) had obstetric hemorrhage while the remaining were admitted for postpartum cerebrovascular accident 1 (1. 8 %), severe postoperative respiratory distress 1 (1. 8 %) and septicemia 1 (1. 8 %). Twenty of the patients (37 %) received mechanical ventilation with the Newport ventilator, while 32 patients (59 %) received oxygen therapy through intranasal prongs or cannulae. Two patients (4 %) were on room <b>air</b> throughout <b>admission.</b> There were fifteen deaths during the study period, thirteen deaths in the eclampsia group (29. 5 % mortality in the eclampsia group), one death in the obstetric hemorrhage group (50 % mortality in the obstetric hemorrhage group) and a death in the patient with septicemia (100 % mortality). All admissions occurred in the postpartum period. Discussion: The high maternal mortality in this study highlights the problem of critical care obstetrics in the developing world. However, unlike other studies, eclampsia was the predominant diagnosis at the intensive care unit admission. Late presentation of patients coupled with inadequacy of intensive care unit may have contributed to high maternal mortality in this study...|$|R
40|$|Asthma {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{diseases}} in childhood, which has been increased during last decade because of epidemiological pattern changes with climate and industrialization of the communities. There are some controversies on the relationship between air pollution and asthma. Tehran, as the capital of Iran, {{is one of the}} densest populations and {{is one of the most}} polluted cities in the world. This study was performed to search effects of various air pollutants using GIS-based modeling on the rate of hospitalizations due to asthma in children in Tehran. Information of patients who were admitted with a diagnosis of asthma in a referral pediatric hospital was checked and the total number of admissions in the same age range (2 to 14 years) during a 2 -year period (March 2009 -March 2011) were calculated. Information about air pollutants including carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and sulfur dioxide, obtained from the air quality control center. Days of the year divided into GOOD and NONGOOD days according to the guideline for reporting of the daily air quality index (AQI). Two thousand two hundred nineteen cases enrolled in the study and asthma admission to total admission ratio compared with air pollutants data in admission day (725 days), using nonlinear regression method. Analysis of the data revealed that there is a significant relationship between NONGOOD nitrogen dioxide (P = 0. 01), ozone (P = 0. 01), and sulfur dioxide (P = 0. 04), levels and admission due to asthma in children, but There was no significant relationship between carbon monoxide levels and asthma admission in children. A significant relationship between nitrogen dioxide, ozone and sulfur dioxide concentration in <b>air</b> and <b>admission</b> due to asthma at levels other than GOOD, reveals air pollutants levels can be significantly harmful to children before AQI reaches to hazardous levels. </div...|$|R
40|$|Time series {{studies of}} {{environmental}} exposures often involve comparing daily {{changes in a}} toxicant measured {{at a point in}} space with daily changes in an aggregate measure of health. Spatial misalignment of the exposure and response variables can bias the estimation of health risk and the magnitude of this bias depends on the spatial variation of the exposure of interest. In air pollution epidemiology, there is an increasing focus on estimating the health effects of the chemical components of particulate matter. One issue that is raised by this new focus is the spatial misalignment error introduced by the lack of spatial homogeneity in many of the particulate matter components. Current approaches to estimating short-term health risks via time series modeling do {{not take into account the}} spatial properties of the chemical components and therefore could result in biased estimation of those risks. We present a spatial-temporal statistical model for quantifying spatial misalignment error and show how adjusted heath risk estimates can be obtained using a regression calibration approach and a two-stage Bayesian model. We apply our methods to a database containing information on hospital <b>admissions,</b> <b>air</b> pollution, and weather for 20 large urban counties in the United States...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundData {{collected}} {{in clinical trials}} {{have been used to}} develop scoring systems that identify adults with malaria at greatest risk of death. One of these, the RCAM score, can be simply determined by measuring a patient’s Glasgow Coma Score and respiratory rate on admission to hospital. However the safety of using the RCAM score to define high-risk patients has not been assessed outside of the clinical trial setting. MethodsA retrospective audit of medical records of all adults admitted with a diagnosis of malaria to two tertiary referral hospitals in Lower Myanmar in 2013 was undertaken. An RCAM score was calculated in all patients and related to their subsequent clinical course. ResultsThe recent decline in malaria hospitalizations at both sites continued in 2013. During the year 90 adults were hospitalized with malaria; 62 (69 %) had Plasmodium falciparum mono-infection, 11 (12 %) had Plasmodium vivax mono-infection, 17 (19 %) had mixed infection. All seven (7. 7 %) deaths occurred in patients infected with P. falciparum. An admission RCAM score < 2 identified all the patients that would survive to discharge (positive predictive value (95 % confidence interval (CI)) 100 % (94. 9 - 100 %) and also predicted a requirement for less supportive care: 9 / 70 (13 %) patients with an admission RCAM score < 2 required supportive care (blood transfusion, vasopressor support or oxygen supplementation) during their hospitalization compared with 12 / 20 (60 %) patients with an admission RCAM score ≥ 2 (p <  0. 0001). No patient with P. vivax mono-infection required supportive care during their hospitalization. Patients with an oxygen saturation ≤ 95 % on room <b>air</b> on <b>admission</b> were more likely to die before discharge (odds ratio 17. 3 (95 % CI: 2. 9 - 101. 2) than patients with a higher oxygen saturation (p =  0. 002). ConclusionsEven outside a clinical trial setting the RCAM score reliably identifies adults with malaria who are at greatest risk of death and can be safely used in the initial triage and management of these patients...|$|R
