5|$|Aaron Benjamin Sorkin (born June 9, 1961) is an American screenwriter, director, {{producer}} and playwright. His works include the Broadway plays <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> and The Farnsworth Invention; the television series Sports Night, The West Wing, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and The Newsroom; and the films <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men,</b> The American President, Charlie Wilson's War, Moneyball and Steve Jobs. For writing The Social Network, {{he won the}} Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, among other awards. He made his feature directorial debut in 2017 with Molly's Game, which he also wrote.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, it was {{announced}} that Sorkin would be adapting <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> for a live production on NBC, slated to air in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin wrote several {{drafts of}} the script for <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> in his Manhattan apartment, {{learning}} the craft from a book about screenplay format. He then spent several months at the Los Angeles offices of Castle Rock, working on the script with director Rob Reiner. William Goldman (who regularly worked under contract at Castle Rock) became his mentor and helped him to adapt his stageplay into a screenplay. The movie was directed by Reiner, starred Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore and Kevin Bacon, and was produced by Brown. <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> was released in 1992 and was a box office success.|$|E

He loved in early life the heroine's mother. That [...] "sainted woman" [...] (tear and nose business) died and is now among the angels--the gentleman who did marry her, by the bye, is not quite so sure about this latter point, but the lawyer is fixed on the idea.|$|R

Nor is it political economy to build a city on good ground, and fill it with store of corn and treasure, and put a score of lepers to live in it. Political economy creates together the means of life, and the living persons who are to use them; and of both, {{the best and the}} most that it can, but imperatively the best, not the most. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>good</b> and healthy <b>men,</b> rather than a multitude of diseased rogues; and a little real milk and wine rather than much chalk and petroleum; but the gist of the whole business is that the men and their property must both be produced together--not one to the loss of the other. Property must not be created in lands desolate by exile of their people, nor multiplied and depraved humanity, in lands barren of bread.|$|R

5|$|In 2005, Sorkin revised {{his play}} <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> for a revival at the London West End theatre, the Haymarket. The play {{opened at the}} Theatre Royal Haymarket {{in the fall of}} the same year and was {{directed}} by David Esbjornson, with Rob Lowe of The West Wing in the lead role.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin got the {{inspiration}} {{to write his}} next play, a courtroom drama called <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men,</b> from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah (who had graduated from Boston University Law School and {{signed up for a}} three-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps). Deborah told Sorkin {{that she was going to}} Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre. He and his roommates had purchased a Macintosh 512K so when he returned home he would empty his pockets of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sorkin {{continued}} writing Making Movies and in 1990 it debuted Off-Broadway at the Promenade Theatre, {{produced by}} John A. McQuiggan, and again directed by Don Scardino. Meanwhile, David Brown was producing a few projects at TriStar Pictures {{and tried to}} interest them in making <b>A</b> <b>Few</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Men</b> into a film but his proposal was declined {{due to the lack}} of star actor involvement. Brown later got a call from Alan Horn at Castle Rock Entertainment who was anxious to make the film. Rob Reiner, a Castle Rock producing partner, opted to direct it.|$|E
