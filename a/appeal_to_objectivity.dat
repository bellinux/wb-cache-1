40|$|On all sides, {{one hears}} <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>objectivity</b> and exhortations <b>to</b> be objective. These admonitions are usually made by scientifically-minded people. Laudable as these appeals may be, they are {{sometimes}} so framed as {{to give the impression}} that objectivity is a quality or property of events that is immediately recognizable. It is thus, a finality, an ultimate for knowledge, which, when recognized, is taken as given. Ulterior questions, as to what constitutes the objective character of fact, are considered spurious meanderings of minds intent on weaving a cosy scheme of the universe. [ [...] . ...|$|R

An argument backs its claims with <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>objectivity</b> and is processed evaluatively. A drama <b>appeals</b> more <b>to</b> subjective criteria and is processed empathically.

40|$|Ethical issues {{concerning}} {{pain and suffering}} of animals are necessarily a consideration {{when it comes to}} killing “pest” or “feral” species in Australia. Within a continent where there are no large predators, many introduced animal species such as rabbits, foxes, horses, donkeys, camels, goats, and mice have been able to thrive, competing with the interests of farmers and graziers, and livestock and food production. These species, thus, gain the label of “pest. ” Many methods now exist to kill these species and, consequently, ethical issues arise concerning the possible pain and suffering caused {{as a direct result of}} these methods. Yet within government and scientific communities, ethical issues are reduced to a secondary consideration without serious debate or contention. Ethical issues appear to be at odds with scientific agendas. How can environmental ethics be incorporated as part of science-based decision making that <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> <b>objectivity</b> and scientific evidence? Within educational institutions as well, the same dilemma exists: How can ethical issues be addressed within the science curriculum and in the classroom? A greater understanding of various perspectives on the subject of environmental ethics and the value positions advocated by proponents of these perspectives may help teachers consider ways of handling such issues in the science classroom. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Jonathan Z. Smith {{contends that}} a taxonomic agenda {{underlies}} {{the study of}} religion. Before Smith, structuralist scholars saw it as their task to uncover the roots of human taxonomic arrangements that present themselves as natural. Drawing somewhat anachronistically on Smith’s taxonomic model, I argue that underlying investigative categories posed by structural anthropologists are operative strategies of subjective value and valuation. I employ Smith to amend structuralist classificatory paradigms and to speak to questions of normativity, values, and concealed agendas in the contemporary study of religion. Smith’s comparative program serves as a fertile territory of encounter between divergent religious studies subfields. In short, I argue that although the normative turn in religious studies has generally succeeded in deconstructing <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> scholarly <b>objectivity,</b> it faces challenges along other parameters...|$|R

30|$|Questions {{over the}} form of {{knowledge}} {{and the role of}} analysis in relation to policy making are varied and contentious [1]. Tensions in theory and practice exist between claims <b>to</b> <b>objectivity</b> and <b>appeals</b> <b>to</b> deliberative processes in the constitution of policy making [2]. Such tensions are exacerbated when policy making’s inherent orientation to the future is made explicit. Not only does policy’s concern with that which has not yet happened bring in to question the application of a range of orthodox forms of research [3, 4], but it also brings to the fore questions of how possible and preferred futures are to be identified, discussed and realised [5]. Such tensions regarding the role of knowledge and the nature of policy making are epitomised and can be explored through an examination of the status and operations of independent fiscal councils (IFCs). The aim {{of this paper is to}} review the rationale, form and function of IFCs in order to gain insights into how futures are and could be represented and realised in policy making.|$|R

40|$|Aim: This paper {{examines}} <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear in general: its perceived positive aspects, its negative characteristics, its appropriate {{as well as}} its fallacious use. Background: <b>Appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear is {{a commonly}} used marketing method that attempts to change behaviour by creating anxiety in those receiving a fearful message. It is regularly used in public health initiatives such as anti-smoking, anti-drunk driving campaigns as well as in hypertension awareness campaigns. Some chiropractors appear <b>to</b> use <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear to promote subluxation awareness and thereby encourage the use of chiropractic treatment. Research supporting its use is equivocal; nevertheless, when used judiciously, <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear probably has sufficient strengths to warrant its continued conditional use. When used to promote care {{for which there is no}} supporting evidence, its use is fallacious. Discussion: <b>Appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear has been used in health promotion campaigns for sixty years or more with the intent of modifying behaviours. While there is evidence <b>to</b> suggest that <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear may motivate some individuals to modify offending behaviour or adopt recommended behaviour there is growing resistance to the use of <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear on ethical and psychological grounds. Using <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear as a tool of persuasion can be valid or fallacious depending on the truth of the premises within the argument. When used to raise awareness about genuine health concerns such as smoking, drunk driving and hypertension <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear is considered to be a valid approach with certain caveats. However, when <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear, not based on evidence or reason, is used as motivator to get others to accept unnecessary interventions for unproven disorders, the use of <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear is fallacious. Conclusion: In spite of the evidence against its use, it seems likely that <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear will continue to be used in conjunction with other public awareness initiatives to modify recognized detrimental behaviours such as smoking and drunk driving as well as silent killers such as hypertension. However, when used to promote a treatment that has no evidentiary basis such as subluxation based practice in chiropractic the <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fear is a fallacy and must be stopped...|$|R
