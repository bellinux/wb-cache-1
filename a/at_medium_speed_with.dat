40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the performance and}} emissions contours of a hydrogen dual fueled compression ignition (CI) engine with two pilot fuels (diesel and rapeseed methyl ester), and compares the performance and emissions iso-contours of diesel and rapeseed methyl ester (RME) single fueling with diesel and RME piloted hydrogen dual fueling throughout the engines operating speed and power range. The collected data {{have been used to}} produce iso-contours of thermal efficiency, volumetric efficiency, specific oxides of nitrogen (NOX), specific hydrocarbons (HC) and specific carbon dioxide (CO 2) on a power-speed plane. The performance and emission maps are experimentally investigated, compared, and critically discussed.

For diesel and RME single fueling the maximum specific NOX emissions are centered at the mid speed, mid power region. Hydrogen dual fueling produced higher specific NOX with both pilot fuels as compared to their respective single fueling operations. The range, location and trends of specific NOX varied significantly when compared to single fueling cases. The volumetric efficiency is discussed in detail with the implications of manifold injection of hydrogen analyzed with the conclusions drawn...|$|R

50|$|Efficiency of {{automotive}} alternators {{is limited by}} fan cooling loss, bearing loss, iron loss, copper loss, and the voltage drop in the diode bridges.

Meanwhile, the ozone forming potential of these pollutants based on their ozone SR (Specific Reactivity) has also been addressed in this study. The experiments were performed on transient as well as steady-state modes {{in accordance with the}} standard protocols recommended for light duty vehicle emissions. Carbonyls and BTEX were analyzed by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) with UV detector and GC/MS (Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy), respectively. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were the predominant components of the carbonyls for E- 0 and E- 10, respectively. During transient mode, formaldehyde, acrolein + acetone, and tolualdehyde pollutants were decreased but, acetaldehyde emissions increased with E- 10 as compared to E- 0. The BTEX emissions were also decreased with E- 10, relative to E- 0. During the steady-state modes, formaldehyde, acrolein + acetone and propionaldehyde were lower, aromatic aldehydes were absent, but acetaldehyde pollutants were higher with E- 10 compared to E- 0. The BTEX emissions were decreased <b>at</b> <b>medium</b> and higher <b>speed</b> modes however, increased at lower <b>speed</b> mode <b>with</b> E- 10 as compared to E- 0. Total BTEX emissions were maximal at lower speed mode but, least <b>at</b> <b>medium</b> <b>speed</b> mode for both the fuels.
