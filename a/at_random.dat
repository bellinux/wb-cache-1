5|$|One {{can form}} a 2-satisfiability {{instance}} <b>at</b> <b>random,</b> {{for a given}} number n of variables and m of clauses, by choosing each clause uniformly <b>at</b> <b>random</b> from the set of all possible two-variable clauses. When m is small relative to n, such an instance will likely be satisfiable, but larger values of m have smaller probabilities of being satisfiable. More precisely, if m/n is fixed as a constant α ≠ 1, the probability of satisfiability tends to a limit as n goes to infinity: if α<1, the limit is one, while if α>1, the limit is zero. Thus, the problem exhibits a phase transition at α=1.|$|E

5|$|Almost every {{sufficiently}} sparse random graph is pseudoforest. That is, if c is {{a constant}} with 0 < c < 1/2, and Pc(n) is the probability that choosing uniformly <b>at</b> <b>random</b> among the n-vertex graphs with cn edges results in a pseudoforest, then Pc(n) tends to one in the limit for large n. However, for c > 1/2, almost every random graph with cn edges has a large component that is not unicyclic.|$|E
5|$|At least 802 prisoners {{attempted}} {{to escape from}} the Auschwitz camps, mostly Polish or Soviet prisoners fleeing from work sites outside the camp. 144 were successful. The fates of 331 of the escapees are unknown. A common punishment for escape attempts was death by starvation; the families of successful escapees were sometimes arrested and interned in Auschwitz and prominently displayed to deter others. If someone did manage to escape, the SS picked ten people <b>at</b> <b>random</b> from the prisoner's block and starved them to death.|$|E

5|$|Because each {{configuration}} {{has only}} a bounded number of predecessors, the evolution of Rule 90 preserves the entropy of any configuration. In particular, if an infinite initial configuration is selected by choosing the state of each cell independently <b>at</b> <b>random,</b> {{with each of the}} two states being equally likely to be selected, then each subsequent configuration can be described by exactly the same probability distribution.|$|E
5|$|Even though Lanley {{succeeds in}} winning over {{almost the entire}} town, his salesmanship fails to {{convince}} Marge, who is frustrated with the town's purchase because she (correctly) believes the monorail is unsafe and that Lanley is a conman. While watching TV, Homer sees an advertisement that suggests he attend Lanley's institute of monorail conducting, which is a transparent effort to make even more money from the con. Homer immediately decides to enroll. After a three-week course, Lanley selects Homer <b>at</b> <b>random</b> from among his classmates to be the monorail conductor.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Juster had {{received}} a Ford Foundation grant for a children's book about cities. Unable to make progress on that project, he turned to writing what became The Phantom Tollbooth, his first book. His housemate, Feiffer, a cartoonist, interested himself in the project. Jason Epstein, an editor <b>at</b> <b>Random</b> House, bought the book and published it. The book received rave reviews and has sold in excess of three million copies, far more than expected. It has been adapted into a film, opera, and play, and translated into many languages.|$|E

It will take a number of passes of writing data and garbage collecting before those spaces are consolidated to show improved performance.|$|E

StG 77 was targeting RAF Warmwell. The Geschwader failed to find its target, dropping its bombs <b>at</b> <b>random.</b> The other Ju 87 units had attracted much attention and StG 77 escaped unnoticed.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a limited}} number of effects and, aside from brief {{ballpark}} jingles, there is no real background music present during the game. For example, the charge fanfare is played <b>at</b> <b>random</b> points and the introductory screen begins with a different baseball tune while the player is loading up and selecting his team, along with a home run fanfare. Generic sound effects include the bat cracking upon contact with the ball, the sound of the ball flying through the air during a pitch, bouncing and throwing effects, and a stream of crowd noises.|$|E
5|$|This {{changed in}} 1859 when James Clerk Maxwell contributed {{significantly}} to the field, more specifically, to the kinetic theory of gases, by presenting work where he assumed the gas particles move in random directions <b>at</b> <b>random</b> velocities. The kinetic theory of gases and statistical physics continued to be developed {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, with work done chiefly by Clausius, Ludwig Boltzmann and Josiah Gibbs, which would later have an influence on Albert Einstein's model for Brownian movement.|$|E

Thor must join forces with his now-imprisoned brother Loki to stop them.|$|E

Modnar is shocked <b>at</b> <b>Random's</b> actions, {{claiming}} that he is just a machine, but Random counters by saying it's his own will to destroy the Snatchers. He gives his regards to Gillian and Jaime, and to Metal, as the orbital weapon fires on the temple and obliterates it.|$|R
5|$|VHS {{tapes of}} Animaniacs were {{released}} in the United States and in the United Kingdom. All of these tapes are out of production, but are still available at online sellers. The episodes featured are jumbled <b>at</b> <b>random</b> and are in no particular order with the series.

5|$|A French-inspired {{initiative}} for international cooperation in metrology {{led to the}} signing in 1875 of the Metre Convention. Initially the convention only covered standards for the metre and the kilogram. A set of 30 prototypes of the metre and 40 prototypes of the kilogram, in each case made of a 90% platinum-10% iridium alloy, were manufactured by the British firm Johnson, Matthey & Co and accepted by the CGPM in 1889. One of each was selected <b>at</b> <b>random</b> to become the International prototype metre and International prototype kilogram that replaced the mètre des Archives and kilogramme des Archives respectively. Each member state was entitled to one {{of each of the}} remaining prototypes to serve as the national prototype for that country.|$|E
5|$|After {{sufficiently}} {{upgrading the}} ship and exploring the map, the player is allowed to buy the three powerful artifacts, which then spawn <b>at</b> <b>random</b> ports. Defeating the Ancient Guardian in a card minigame awards the player additional loot and previously unavailable upgrades. Ancient Trader does not include a saving feature, which means that all progress is lost if the game is closed. An online multiplayer mode allows for several players to simultaneously play the same map, chase the artifacts, and defeat the Guardian. The prices of the artifacts increase as other players buy them. The players can check the wealth and artifacts gained by other players. The game also includes several alternative game modes, which focus on reaching a set total wealth or cash tally before other players. The multiplayer does not include an online scoreboard.|$|E
