However, since 2011, the majority of home games have been played at the smaller Cardiff City Stadium, the home of Cardiff City.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{returned}} to Normandy in 1125 and spent about <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> royal court, {{where her father}} Henry was still hoping that his second marriage would generate a male heir.

The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore in January to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have.|$|E

The kelpie immediately reverts to its equine form, and the girl takes it home to her father's farm, where it is put to work for <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of that time the girl rides the kelpie to consult a wise man, who tells her to return the silver necklace. Once again transformed into the handsome young man she had first met the wise man asks the kelpie whether if given the choice it would choose to be a kelpie or a mortal.

5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to {{participate}} in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.|$|E
5|$|By September 1889 Nielsen had progressed {{well enough}} on the violin to gain a {{position}} with the second violins in the prestigious Royal Danish Orchestra which played at Copenhagen's Royal Theatre, then conducted by Johan Svendsen. In this position he experienced Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff and Otello at their Danish premieres. Although this employment sometimes caused Nielsen considerable frustration, he continued to play there until 1905. After Svendsen's retirement in 1906, Nielsen increasingly served as conductor (being officially appointed assistant conductor in 1910). Between graduation and attaining this position, he made a modest income from private violin lessons while enjoying the continuing support of his patrons, not only Jens Georg Nielsen but also Albert Sachs (born 1846) and Hans Demant (1827–1897) who both ran factories in Odense. After less than <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Royal Theatre, Nielsen won a scholarship of 1,800 kroner, giving him the means to spend several months travelling in Europe.|$|E

He moved to Chippenham Town in 2003, before signing for Walsall in the Football League in 2005. He moved out on loan to Kidderminster Harriers of the Conference National in 2006, before signing permanently in 2007. After <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> club, during which he scored the first club goal at the new Wembley Stadium in the 2007 FA Trophy Final, he returned to the League with Shrewsbury Town. After spending 2008–09 on loan at Oxford United, he signed for the club permanently in 2009. Constable scored the second goal in Oxford's 3–1 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final victory over York City in 2010, which secured Oxford's promotion into League Two.

5|$|Druckmann {{soon became}} a {{research}} assistant at Florida State University, while living in Tallahassee, Florida. He spent <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> university working at the Visualization Lab within the School of Computational Science and Information Technology, beginning in July 2002. During this time, he began developing the game Pink-Bullet, for Linux and Microsoft Windows, with some friends. At one point, {{he wanted to be}} an animator, which required enlisting in art classes, but his parents forbade him from doing so. After taking a programming class, Druckmann realized that it was his preference, and began a Bachelor of Computer Science in December 2002, which he completed the following year. Druckmann moved to Pittsburgh, where he attended Carnegie Mellon University; in August 2003, he began his Master's degree in Entertainment Technology, which he earned in 2005 from the Entertainment Technology Center. In April 2004, Druckmann developed the game Dikki Painguin in: TKO for the Third Reich for the Nintendo Entertainment System as a student at Carnegie Mellon, in collaboration with fellow student Allan Blomquist.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} {{professional}} stage debut in 1983, playing Tim Allgood in Michael Frayn's Noises Off, which ran for <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Savoy Theatre. To broaden {{his knowledge of}} working on stage, he joined the National Theatre. He supplemented his stage roles in the 1980s with television roles, appearing in comedies such as the aborted pilot episode of Blackadder, Chelmsford 123, The Lenny Henry Show and the first episode of Red Dwarf. In 1991, {{he won his first}} major television role playing Mark Taylor in Steven Moffat's semi-autobiographical BBC sitcom Joking Apart. Although only thirteen episodes were made between 1991 and 1995, the role remains Bathurst's favourite of his whole career. After Joking Apart concluded, he was cast as pompous management consultant David Marsden in the ITV comedy drama Cold Feet, which ran for five series from 1998 to 2003.|$|E

5|$|In 1854, the Crimean War {{broke out}} between the Russian Empire and an {{alliance}} of France, Great Britain, the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Ottoman Empire. One of the first battles of the War was the Battle of the Alma where allied forces convincingly defeated the Russian forces. The Siege of Sevastapol followed shortly after in September 1854; it was to last for <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cost of over 128,000 lives, three quarters of which died from disease. After the siege at Sevastapol, the fighting mainly ceased and on 30 March 1856, {{after two years of}} action, the Russians negotiated a Peace Treaty at the Congress of Paris. The Treaty set the Black Sea as neutral territory, closing it to all warships, and prohibiting fortifications and the presence of armaments on its shores. The Crimean War led to a number of large-scale changes in the British Army. The sale of commissions came under great scrutiny during the war, especially in connection with the Battle of Balaclava, which saw the ill-fated Charge of the Light Brigade. This scrutiny eventually led to the abolition of the sale of commissions.|$|E
5|$|On May 30, 1930, Bacher married Jean Dow. His {{mother gave}} them a Ford Model A {{and the use of}} the family's lakeside holiday house, where they entertained guests {{including}} Paul Ehrenfest and Enrico Fermi. In 1931, with a National Research Council Fellowship, he spent <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> California Institute of Technology (Caltech) because Ira Bowen taught there. At Caltech Bacher attended lectures by Robert Oppenheimer, but spent most of his time at the Mt. Wilson Observatory, which had a better library. Bacher decided to create a work listing the energy, coupling constant, parity and electron configurations of all the known atoms and ions, working with Goudsmit back in Ann Arbor. The result was a book, Atomic Energy States as Derived from the Analysis of Optical Spectra (1932), which they dedicated to Randall.|$|E
5|$|The Survivor Series in November 2003 also {{marked the}} first time Lesnar met Goldberg from the Raw brand. After Lesnar claimed in a {{backstage}} interview that he could beat anybody in the world, Goldberg interrupted the interview and introduced himself to Lesnar, shaking hands with him before leaving with a staredown. Lesnar followed this rivalry with a feud involving Hardcore Holly. In the storyline, Holly wanted revenge on Lesnar for legitimately injuring his neck during a previous match between the two in 2002 which left Holly in need of neck surgery and out of action for <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> Royal Rumble on January 25, 2004, Lesnar defeated Holly to retain the WWE Championship.
