5|$|Rugby {{has played}} <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> {{the life of}} the school, despite only supplanting {{football}} as the school's primary sport in 1921. All boys are encouraged to play when they enter Lower Grammar but are not required to play throughout their time at the school. Stonyhurst has a successful rugby season, with games well supported by pupils, staff and parents. Sporting rivalry is particularly prominent against fellow Catholic independent schools Ampleforth College and Mount St Mary's College and Sedbergh School in Cumbria. The Stonyhurst Sevens take place annually, attracting large crowds and teams from all over the country.|$|E
5|$|With the Tanahashi rivalry behind him, Devitt moved onto a new {{rivalry with}} Togi Makabe, who played <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> him losing the Lumberjack Deathmatch. Meanwhile, Devitt also found himself a new {{challenger}} for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, recent NJPW signee Kota Ibushi, who pinned him a tag team match on 9 November at Power Struggle, {{where he and}} Bad Luck Fale were defeated by Ibushi and Makabe. From 23 November to 7 December, Devitt and Fale {{took part in the}} 2013 World Tag League, where they finished with a record of three wins and three losses, with a loss against the previously winless Captain New Japan and Hiroshi Tanahashi on the final day costing them a spot in the semifinals.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{discharge}} from military service, Groza {{reported to the}} Browns' training camp in Bowling Green, Ohio. He showed up in army fatigues carrying all his clothes in a duffel bag. There, he joined quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and receivers Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie to form {{the core of the}} new team's offense. Groza was mainly a placekicker in his first two years with the Browns, but he played <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the team's early success. In his first season, he set a professional football record for both field goals and extra points. The Browns, meanwhile, advanced to the AAFC championship against the New York Yankees. Groza sprained his ankle in the game and missed three field goals, but Cleveland won 14–9. Behind a powerful offense led by Graham, Motley and Lavelli, the Browns finished the 1947 season with a 12–1–1 record and made it back to the championship game. Groza, however, was injured and could only watch as the team won its second championship in a row.|$|E

The track addresses the changing industry, as the digital world plays <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> advertising and branding every year.|$|R
50|$|Belmondo first {{appeared}} in the short Moliere (1956). His first film role was a scene with Jean-Pierre Cassel in On Foot, on Horse, and on Wheels (1957), which was cut from the final film; however he had <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the follow up A Dog, a Mouse, and a Sputnik (1958).|$|R
25|$|Phillip {{took part}} in the Leeward's winning Red Stripe Cup campaigns of 1993/94 and 1995/96. He played <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the 1995/96 Cup Final against Trinidad and Tobago by taking three wickets in the fourth innings which helped his team to win by 73 runs.|$|E
25|$|Immanuel Church is used {{frequently}} for concerts of music, generally (but not exclusively) {{from the}} classical genre. The {{organ of the}} church is {{regarded as one of the}} best in the country and plays <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> concerts, as well as its key use in regular worship.|$|E
25|$|Two of the aircraft, {{operated}} by T, {{were found to}} be hauling cargo in Kuwait {{at the end of the}} Gulf War. This discovery played <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> prompting some of the investigations, and resulted in the Forest Service and the FAA insisting that the planes be returned to the U.S.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his second}} film, City Across the River (also in 1949), he was {{credited}} as [...] "Anthony Curtis". He had four lines in The Lady Gambles (1949) and <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> Johnny Stool Pigeon (1949). He {{could also be}} spotted in Francis (1950), Woman in Hiding (1950), and I Was a Shoplifter (1950).|$|R
25|$|For {{most of its}} history, {{smokestack}} {{industries and}} a blue-collar work ethic defined Lima. Nothing played <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> shaping the city's self-image than its connection to railroads and railroading – as a Midwestern rail hub and even more as home to the Lima Locomotive Works, whose products for more than 70 years carried the city's name globally.|$|R
50|$|Apart from {{a factory}} {{producing}} various tanks made of glassfiber-reinforced plastic (Bokn Plast), {{there is no}} industry on the islands other than some fish farming. People have traditionally lived off fishing and farming, but more recently, some work {{has been in the}} North Sea petroleum industry. Tourism is likely to play <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the future.|$|R
25|$|In the ICC World Cricket League Division One {{tournament in}} Kenya {{prior to the}} World Cup he played <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> Bermuda's only win, scoring an unbeaten 49 against Scotland as they chased 269 with an over to spare.

25|$|At {{the desperate}} Battle of Chickamauga, he lent {{valuable}} support to General George Thomas, and his courageous acts were praised as {{the salvation of}} the remaining Union forces after their defeat. He reunited with Thomas at Nashville (December 1864), taking heavy losses at first, but playing <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the dramatic victory that ended {{the war in the}} west.|$|E
25|$|Luisa {{had always}} {{been active in the}} {{upbringing}} of her grandchildren. She is a traditionalist, and disapproved when her grandson's wife, Sandra (Clare Wilkie), opted {{to go back to work}} instead of staying at home to look after her son, Joe (Jake Kyprianou). When the di Marcos interference became too much, Sandra walked out, abandoning Joe. Luisa subsequently played <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> her great grandson's upbringing.|$|E
50|$|Rays of the Rising Dawn - a YMCA girls club {{consisting}} of characters Traci Kihara, Gina Oshiro, Laura Murayama, Jodie Louie, Lori Shigemura, Rhonda Whang and Kandi Mitsuda. Lori has <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the novel {{than the rest}} of the girls because she has a constant crush on Jerry throughout their years in middle school.|$|R
50|$|Religion is <b>a</b> very <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the community, {{and it is}} {{estimated}} to be about 75% Mormon.|$|R
50|$|Jerome Baldino (better {{known as}} Baldino) {{is the local}} {{inventor}} on Proxima Island. He aids Twinsen in the game with his protopack, which the player must use to rob a museum. He only appears for a short time, though he plays <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> Little <b>Big</b> Adventure 2.

Logan, who commanded the 26th Division from 1923 to 1928. The 101st helped gained fame when it played <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. Army Air Service's flight around the world. It then cared for the Spirit of St. Louis when Charles Lindbergh visited the state.|$|E
25|$|It {{is likely}} that UDR {{soldiers}} and RUC officers helped prepare the attack, or {{were aware of the}} preparations. It is also likely that the farm of RUC officer James Mitchell at Glenanne played <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the preparations. Based on the material available, there is insufficient evidence that senior security force personnel were involved. However, it is possible that UDR/RUC involvement was covered up at a higher level.|$|E
25|$|Social {{media are}} playing <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> {{revealing}} world events to a vast audience. Whenever {{there is a}} major event in the world, there are usually people with camera phones ready to capture photos and post them on various social networks. Such convenience allows the Associated Press and other companies {{to reach out to the}} citizen journalist who holds ownership of the photos and get permission to use those photos in news outlets.|$|E
50|$|Very {{close to}} his sister, Erik threw her a giant sweet sixteenth {{birthday}} bash and drove her up to Hanover on her {{first day of school}} there. Aside from his brief appearances, Erik remained a relatively quiet secondary character throughout the series, however he did have <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the Gossip Girl prequel, Gossip Girl: It Had to Be You.|$|R
50|$|Born in Hednesford, Staffordshire, Rogers {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Worcestershire against Gloucestershire at New Road in June 1923, taking two wickets in the game. He appeared {{in only one}} more match that season, taking another two wickets, but played <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the county's 1924 season when he played in nine games; however, he finished the year with only five wickets and 37 runs from those nine appearances.|$|R
5000|$|On {{more than}} one {{occasion}} in the 2000s and 2010s, a retired Halilhodžić expressed bitterness over not getting <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the national team during the 1970s and 1980s, sarcastically citing [...] "the fact my surname was too long for Belgrade scoreboards", thus insinuating that he feels the fact he is a Muslim may have been the reason for his modest playing time in the national team.|$|R
25|$|Coming to Europe {{and then}} England with the New Zealand forces during the War, he {{qualified}} for Warwickshire and was highly successful for several seasons. His best year was 1948 {{when he took}} 172 wickets {{at an average of}} 18.75. In 1951, his bowling, by now fast-medium rather than outright fast, played <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> Warwickshire's unexpected County Championship success. He took three hat tricks for the county during his career, as of 2016 still a record for the club.|$|E
25|$|Major events {{also play}} <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> tourism in Victoria, {{particularly}} cultural tourism and sports tourism.

25|$|Inuit {{industry}} relied {{almost exclusively}} on animal hides, driftwood, and bones, although some tools were also made out of worked stones, particularly the readily worked soapstone. Walrus ivory was a particularly essential material, used to make knives. Art played <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> Inuit society and continues to do so today. Small sculptures of animals and human figures, usually depicting everyday activities such as hunting and whaling, were carved from ivory and bone. In modern times prints and figurative works carved in relatively soft stone such as soapstone, serpentinite, or argillite have also become popular.|$|E
5000|$|The {{charcoal}} burning {{was considered}} a complicated chemical process, many aspects of which were unclear to uneducated or ignorant workers. They believed that mythical creatures were involved, e.g. Zhivinka helped, while Pustodymka (lit. [...] "empty smoke") or [...] "Ognevka" [...] (lit. [...] "fire girl") interfered with the process. However the author noted that supernatural played <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the miners' lore than in the lore of charcoal burners or blast furnace workers.|$|R
40|$|Until recently, when {{assessing}} the economic effects of monetary policy, economists {{have emphasized the}} role of unanticipated changes in policy. But are these policy shocks {{likely to be the}} most important influence on the economy? Mike Dotsey believes not. It seems more likely that the Fed's systematic behavior plays <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> what happens in the U. S. economy. In "How the Fed Affects the Economy: A Look at Systematic Monetary Policy," Dotsey explains the ways in which systematic policy influences economic activityMonetary policy...|$|R
50|$|Then came Floods & Fires. Leggett played <b>a</b> much <b>bigger</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> this Juno-nominated album {{than any}} {{previous}} release, which he and Cardiff recorded over a span of {{a year and a}} half.|$|R

He has since spoken many times of his affection for Cambridge United.|$|E
25|$|The key to India's bowling in the 1970s {{were the}} Indian spin quartet – Bishen Bedi, E.A.S. Prasanna, BS Chandrasekhar and Srinivas Venkataraghavan. This period {{also saw the}} {{emergence}} of two of India's best ever batsmen, Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Viswanath. Indian pitches have had tendency to support spin and the spin quartet exploited this to create collapses in opposing batting line-ups. These players {{were responsible for the}} back-to-back series wins in 1971 in the West Indies and in England, under the captaincy of Ajit Wadekar. Gavaskar scored 774 runs in the West Indian series while Dilip Sardesai's 112 played <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> their one Test win.|$|E
25|$|Although Finn {{played no}} part in the Test series against Pakistan, he played <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the limited overs series.

He took three wickets in the next game to help England level the series, before taking 0–31 in the final game to help England win the series 2–1.|$|E
50|$|In April 2009, Spillane {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} extension with Norwich City. Spillane {{went on to}} play <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> Norwich's 2009-10 League One winning season playing 13 times and scoring once against Leyton Orient, although he missed around half the season with injury. In July 2010, he transferred to Brentford for an undisclosed fee. In September 2010, he scored his penalty as Brentford knocked Everton out of the League Cup on penalties. Spillane scored his first and {{what turned out to}} be only Brentford goal in a 3-1 win at Sheffield Wednesday.|$|R
50|$|He {{was also}} used in Summer Love (1958), and had <b>a</b> {{slightly}} <b>bigger</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> Live Fast, Die Young (1958). He began appearing on TV <b>in</b> a guest <b>part</b> <b>in</b> Man Without a Gun (1958).|$|R
