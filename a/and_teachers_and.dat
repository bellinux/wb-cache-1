Warsaw Politechnic under {{occupation}} educated 3,000students, issuing 186engineering degrees, 18doctoral ones and 16habilitations. Jagiellonian University issued 468masters and 62doctoral degrees, employed over 100professors <b>and</b> <b>teachers,</b> <b>and</b> served more than 1,000students per year.

5|$|In the General Government, the {{remaining}} schools were subjugated to the German educational system, {{and the number}} and competence of their Polish staff was steadily scaled down. All universities and most secondary schools were closed, if not immediately after the invasion, then by mid-1940. By late 1940, no official Polish educational institutions more advanced than a vocational school remained in operation, and they offered nothing beyond the elementary trade and technical training required for the Nazi economy. Primary schooling was to last for seven years, but the classes {{in the final two}} years of the program were to be limited to meeting one day per week. There was no money for heating of the schools in winter. Classes and schools were to be merged, Polish teachers dismissed, and the resulting savings used to sponsor the creation of schools for children of the German minority or to create barracks for German troops. No new Polish teachers were to be trained. The educational curriculum was censored; subjects such as literature, history and geography were removed. Old textbooks were confiscated and school libraries were closed. The new educational aims for Poles included convincing them that their national fate was hopeless, and teaching them to be submissive and respectful to Germans. This was accomplished through deliberate tactics such as police raids on schools, police inspections of student belongings, mass arrests of students <b>and</b> <b>teachers,</b> <b>and</b> the use of students as forced laborers, often by transporting them to Germany as seasonal workers.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} schools once had a Raucherecke (smokers' corner), a small area of the schoolyard where {{students}} {{over the age of}} eighteen are permitted to smoke in their breaks.

25|$|After {{the first}} {{partition}} Frederick engaged in plunder of Polish property, confiscating Polish estates and monasteries to support German colonization, and in 1786 he ordered forced buy-outs of Polish holdings. The new strict tax system and bureaucracy was particularly disliked among Polish population, {{as was the}} compulsory military service in the army, which didn't exist previously in Poland. Frederick abolished the gentry's freedom from taxation and restricted its power. Royal estates formerly belonging to the Polish Crown were redistributed to German landowners reinforcing Germanization. Both Protestant and Roman Catholic teachers (mostly Jesuits) taught in West Prussia, <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> administrators were encouraged {{to be able to}} speak both German and Polish. Economic exploitation of Poland, especially by Prussia and Austria, followed the territorial seizures.|$|E
25|$|Chinese aid to Ethiopia has {{included}} dispatch of medical teams <b>and</b> <b>teachers,</b> <b>and</b> educational scholarships for Ethiopian students studying in China. China's aid program funded {{the construction of}} a vocational school in Ethiopia. Although the plan was to use Chinese vocational instructions, the school eventually switched to German instructors, with students learning skills including engineering, automobile, architecture and construction. In June 2009, the Chinese ambassador assisted in laying the foundation stone for the Tirunesh Dibaba Beijing Hospital, planned as a modern hospital 6000 square meters in size with 100 beds. The Chinese government is funding construction and will provide medical instruments and equipment. The hospital is named after Ethiopian runner Tirunesh Dibaba, who won two gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The hospital was completed in November 2011 and handed over to the Ethiopian government. Fifteen Chinese medical personnel were sent to help their Ethiopian counterparts.|$|E

500|$|Population {{decline in}} the city of Baltimore due to the {{migration}} of middle-class white populations to the suburbs during the 1950s and 1960s, coupled with the failure of Baltimore City Public Schools officials to address infrastructure improvements needed in the school's deteriorating, then-thirty-seven-year-old main academic building lead to a gradually declining public perception of the school's academic reputation. In response, school administrators and faculty developed the [...] "City Forever" [...] strategic plan in 1965–66. The performance improvement plan also served as a call to action for the school community, resulting in formal recommendations from the Alumni Association, a series of student-led demonstrations, newspaper articles and television news segments produced by alumni working as media professionals, letters-to-the-editors of local newspapers submitted by parents <b>and</b> <b>teachers,</b> <b>and</b> routine public comments in support of City College at School Board meetings. The public outcry stunned city leadership, which resulted in the district announcing a recommitment to Baltimore City College and its unique role as the selective flagship high school of Baltimore.|$|E
500|$|On January 21, 2014, an {{anonymous}} poster started a thread on /b/ identifying a student named Westley Sullivan who apparently {{went to the}} same high school as the poster. The original post included a link to Westley Sullivan's Facebook profile, which has since been taken down, and a screenshot of a post which said [...] "if fairview isnt closed tomorrow im going to blow it up", referring to Sullivan's high school, Fairview High School, in Boyd County, Kentucky. A few anonymous individuals went to Sullivan's Facebook profile and found his address, phone number, school ID number, school schedule <b>and</b> <b>teachers,</b> <b>and</b> other personal information. Information like his teachers and ID number had been posted directly, and the more personal information like his address was found in the EXIF data of some of the pictures posted on his profile.
