50|$|Tits are cavity-nesting birds, {{typically}} using trees, although Pseudopodoces {{builds a}} nest on the ground. Most tree-nesting tits excavate their nests, and clutch sizes are generally large for altricial birds, ranging from usually two {{eggs in the}} rufous-vented tit of the Himalayas {{to as many as}} 10 to 14 in the blue tit of Europe. In favourable conditions, this species had laid as many as 19 eggs, which is the largest clutch of any <b>altricial</b> <b>bird.</b> Most tits are multibrooded, a necessary strategy to cope with either the harsh winters in which they reside in the Holarctic or the extremely erratic conditions of tropical Africa, where typically a single pair cannot find enough food to rear even one nestling and in drought years breeding is likely to be futile.|$|E
50|$|The reptile {{hatchling}} {{is quite}} the opposite of an <b>altricial</b> <b>bird</b> hatchling. Most hatchling reptiles are born with the same instincts as their parents and leave to live on their own immediately after leaving the egg. When first hatched, hatchlings can be several times smaller than their adult forms: Pine Snakes weigh 30 grams when they first hatch, but can grow up to 1,400 grams as adults. This {{appears to have been}} the case even in dinosaurs. In sea turtles, hatchling sex is determined by incubation temperature. In species in which eggs are laid then buried in sand, indentations in the sand can be a clue to imminent hatching. In sea turtles, this usually occurs about 60 days after the laying of eggs, and often at night. However, exposure to xenobiotic compounds, especially endocrine-disrupting compounds, can affect hatchling sex ratios as well. Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and other pollutants like octylphenol are also known to increase rate of hatchling mortality and deformity. Upon hatching, animals such as turtles have innate navigational skills, including compass and beacon methods of navigation, to reach safety. For example, turtle hatchlings instinctively swim against waves to ensure they leave the beach and its predators. They also head towards the brightest part of the horizon in order to reach the water: however, human activity has created sources of light which mislead the turtle hatchlings, causing them to not travel directly to the water, making them vulnerable to dehydration and predation. Hatchlings of the species Iguana iguana also gain gut flora essential to digestion from adults as part of their development. In the wild, hatchling survival rates are extremely low due to factors such as predation, for example, by crabs, as well as due to human-made obstacles. Human intervention has also benefitted hatchling reptiles at times. For example, late-hatched loggerhead turtles are taken in by such groups as the University of Georgia to be raised. In species such as crocodiles, hydration levels also {{play an important role in}} embryo survival.|$|E

40|$|Among many <b>altricial</b> <b>bird</b> species, nestlings {{within a}} brood do not hatch {{simultaneously}} but {{over a period}} of several days (e. g.

Hatching asyn-chrony is mainly determined by incubation beginning before clutch completion, resulting in first-laid eggs hatching earlier than last-laid eggs (Lack 1968, O’Connor 1984) and consequent size hierarchies among nestlings that may cause death or slow develop-ment of late-hatched, small nestlings (Hahn 1981). The existence of hatching asynchrony has been consi-dered a paradox since it can negatively affect repro-ductive success, due to death or poor condition at fledg-ing of disadvantaged offspring (Stoleson & Beissinger 1995).

40|$|Hatching {{asynchrony}} {{is commonly}} observed in many <b>altricial</b> <b>bird</b> species and numerous hypotheses {{have been proposed}} to explain this phenomenon (reviewed by Magrath 1990, Stoleson and Beissinger 1995, Stenning 1996). It has been suggested to result from adaptive parental manipulation of hatching spread to increase fitness, e. g. by making incubation (Nilsson 1993), and provisioning of young (Hussell 1972), more efficient. Alternatively, hatching asynchrony has been proposed as a maladaptive artifact arising from parental necessity to start incubation before the clutch is completed which results in large age and size differences among nestlings within a brood (Veiga 1992). The latter argument has been supported by findings that in broods of experimentally achieved synchrony fledgling success was enhanced in 20 out of 24 studied species (see Nilsson 1995 for review). Thus, if hatching asynchrony is maladaptive, birds may use several possible methods to reduce disadvantages of this phenomenon. For example, the gradual increase of egg mass with laying orde...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{effects of}} polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as {{compounds}} that may disrupt endocrine activity and, consequently, alter reproductive performance were investigated in altricial zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). The breeding performance and breeding cycle of zebra finches differed significantly between nonexposed birds and those experimentally pulse-exposed to Aroclor 1248, a PCB compound (40 mg/bird). Aroclor-exposed birds showed significantly increased numbers of clutches laid, nests con-structed per pair, incubation time per pair, {{and percentage of}} hatchling mortality compared to controls. Not all reproductive parameters were affected. Those traditionally regarded as indicators of reproductive capacity (number of eggs laid per clutch, number of eggs laid per pair, hatchlings per clutch, and fledglings per clutch) did not differ statistically between exposed and control birds. Findings {{support the hypothesis that}} very low PCB doses may be associated with endocrine disruption. It is suggested that evaluation of reproductive parameters related to parental care is more adequate to assess endocrine disruption than is evaluation of reproductive success parameters. Given its short breeding cycle, altricial breeding behavior, and other advantages not possessed by precocial birds, we propose using the zebra finch for evaluations of chemicals with endocrine-disruptive activity.

40|$|Offspring within families, {{both human}} and nonhuman, often differ. The obvious {{question}} is: Why?

These broodmates can effectively live in different worlds.

The high incidence of INP among martins and swallows explains this finding. Contrary to our predictions, even in other groups where there is a high incidence of INP and OP, such as in the tribe Icteri and the Old World finches, the probability of NP being ancestral was very high. We conclude that in all cases but one (Hirundinidae) obligate, and probably facultative, brood parasitism evolved directly from normal breeding mode rather than indirectly through some other form of parasitism.

40|$|Sibling {{competition}} {{mediated by}} begging behavior is extremely common in avian species and {{recent studies have}} highlighted the role of endogenous testosterone in regulating such phenomenon. However, current literature depicts an inconsistent pattern in altricial vs. semi-precocial species, with stimulating versus inhibitory effects of the hormone respectively. This is possibly due to {{a difference in the}} methodology of hormone treatment (short-term moderate dose versus a long-term stronger elevation, respectively) between the studies performed so far. In this study, we induced short-term moderate peaks in plasma testosterone levels, as applied in <b>altricial</b> <b>bird</b> species, and assessed the effects of our manipulation on begging, competitive and aggressive behavior in black-headed gull (Lams ridibundus) chicks, a semi-precocial species. Our results suggest that, unlike in altricial songbirds, temporary increase of plasma testosterone concentration suppresses begging and enhances aggressiveness towards intruders. However, it also increases aggression and the chances of getting priority while scrambling with nest mates to gain access to food. Thus, the inconsistencies in the hormonal control of begging behavior observed between altricial vs. semi-precocial birds seem real and perhaps related to species differences in complexity of the display and the nature of competition. These may be elucidated by future comparative studies. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. ...|$|E

Here we begin to address this gap in knowledge, offering insight into the early, post-hatching, humoral immune response in an <b>altricial</b> <b>bird,</b> the American kestrel (Falco sparverius). Over two breeding seasons, nestling kestrels were immunized with a non-pathogenic antigen, dinitrophenol keyhole limpet hemocyanin (DNP-KLH), between 3 and 9 days post-hatching and boostered 6 days later. Background levels, primary and secondary immune responses were measured using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The specificity of our laboratory produced rabbit, anti-kestrel antibody was determined using a double immunodiffusion assay. Results showed the rabbit antiserum to have specific anti-kestrel IgG activity. Birds as young as three days old could successfully mount an antibody response, the magnitude of which increased with age at first vaccination. Early immunization did not compromise growth rate, nor did it affect the maximum secondary response. Comparatively, adult kestrels immunized during the same season and following the same protocol, had antibody levels four times higher than those of the nestlings. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Sibling and parenteoffspring {{conflicts}} arise mainly {{over the}} amount and distribution of parental care, especially food. In <b>altricial</b> <b>bird</b> species where the young depend on parents for obtaining food, parents may control sibling competition by the choice of their respective provisioning locations. In great tits, the parents use fixed provisioning positions on the nest rim that are determined early in the breeding cycle and maintained until fledging. The two parents may choose positions that are close to each other, or far apart, and thereby increase or relax the pressure for optimal feeding positioning among nestlings. As an inspiration to this study we previously found that the two parents provide food from closer positions if the nest is infested by ectoparasites. Here, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} parental choice of relative provisioning locations could be strategically used to control nestling competition. We forced parents to feed from either one or two provisioning locations and assessed the induced change in nestling movement, weight gain, and food distribution among siblings. We show that the angular distance between male and female locations influences the level of behavioural competition and affects nestling weight gain and food distribution. It is the first evidence for hole-nesting birds, where it was assumed that the nestling closest to the entrance hole was fed first, that the apparent choice of feeding positions by parents could be a way of controlling sibling competition and thereby also taking partial control over the outcome of parenteoffspring conflict...|$|E
40|$|Thyroid hormones {{are closely}} linked to the {{hatching}} process in precocial birds. Previously, we showed that thyroid hormones in brain had a strong impact on filial imprinting, an early learning behavior in newly hatched chicks; brain 3, 5, 3 '-triiodothyronine (T 3) peaks around hatching and imprinting training induces additional T 3 release, thus, extending the sensitive period for imprinting and enabling subsequent other learning. On the other hand, blood thyroid hormone levels have been reported to increase gradually after hatching in altricial species, but it remains unknown how the brain thyroid hormone levels change during post-hatching development of <b>altricial</b> <b>birds.</b> Here, we determined the changes in serum and brain thyroid hormone levels of a passerine songbird species, the zebra finch using radioimmunoassay. In the serum, we found a gradual increase in thyroid hormone levels during post-hatching development, as well as differences between male and female finches. In the brain, there was clear surge in the hormone levels during development in males and females coinciding with the time of fledging, but the onset of the surge of thyroxine (T 4) in males preceded that of females, whereas the onset of the surge of T 3 in males succeeded that of females.

Residuals of BMR (after subtracting BMR allometrically predicted from body mass) were positively correlated with residuals of lean dry heart and kidney mass. Measurements of both BMR and the daily energy expenditure of parent birds (DEEpar) {{during the period of}} nestling care as assessed by labeled-water turnover were collected from the literature for 26 <b>altricial</b> <b>bird</b> species. The allometric relationships with body mass in this data set were: log BMR (W) = - 1. 385 + 0. 684 log mass (g) [fraction of variance (r^ 2) = 0. 973] and log DEEpar (W) = - 0. 797 + 0. 659 log mass (g) (r^ 2 = 0. 967). Residuals of log BMR and log DEEpar were positively correlated with each other. The parallel regressions and correlation of residuals lead to reduced variance in the ratio of BMR/DEEpar (mean 0. 301; SD 0. 086). We suggest that natural selection has led to an adjustment of the size of organs (such as heart and kidney) involved in sustaining energy metabolism at the DEE maximized during parental care and that size-independent variation in BMR reflects the relative size of this highly metabolically active machinery. These relationships of BMR lead to new interpretations of the decline in mass-specific BMR with increasing body size and decreasing latitude and of the difference in mass-specific BMR between birds and mammals. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the notion that}} New Zealand 2 ̆ 7 s avifauna exhibits a macro-evolutionary trend towards low reproductive rates by analysing the allometry of nesting parameters for native altricial land birds. We show that egg size, incubation periods, and nestling periods are all strongly correlated with body mass, but clutch size is not. However, egg size more accurately predicts incubation periods, and incubation periods more accurately predict nestling periods, than does body mass. Variation between and within families is explored. Neither divergence per se nor slow rates of reproduction appear related to the taxic level of endemism. Gigantic species breed more slowly in proportion to body mass as predicted allometrically, but as a macro-evolutionary trend, the effect is counterpointed within New Zealand by a parallel trend towards dwarfism. We found that hollow- and cavity-nesting species have longer nestling periods than open-nesting species. Corvida passerines lay larger eggs, after controlling for body mass, than do Passerida passerines. Most of New Zealand 2 ̆ 7 s <b>altricial</b> <b>bird</b> species evolved from Australian colonists.

A previous study (Trevelyan & Read 1989) suggested that New Zealand birds lay more clutches per year. These findings are inconsistent with suggestions of marked K-selection in the New Zealand avifauna, but may be explicable under the bet-hedging hypothesis for the evolution of life histories. The notion that New Zealand birds breed slowly may have arisen by comparisons with the avifaunas of the Northern Hemisphere, comparisons that ignore the distinctive life history traits of the avifaunas of tropical and other southern temperate regions...|$|E
40|$|Our {{understanding}} of cardiovascular regulation during avian development is primarily derived from embryonic chickens. However, {{the degree to}} which the developmental patterns in embryonic chickens may apply to other bird species is unknown. Given the diversity within this group of vertebrates, differences in physiological development among species might be anticipated. This point is supported by the differences in autonomic tone determined in two different strains of adult chickens (Kuo et al., 2001). However, Pearson and Tazawa (1999) recently compared heart rate changes during avian ontogeny and suggested that many altricial species may share similar patterns of cardiovascular maturation during early development. They documented the relationship of changes in heart rate with embryonic mass and incubation length of several <b>altricial</b> <b>bird</b> species. Given this relationship, the activation of the underlying mechanisms that regulate heart rate (as well as other cardiovascular parameters) may also occur at similar times during maturation among avian species. Studies have established that chickens exhibit several components of the mature cardiovascular regulatory system early in ontogeny (Ignarro and Shideman, 1968; Pappano, 1977). These include responsive adrenergic and cholinergic receptor populations in the developing cardiovascular system as well as anabolic and catabolic enzymes for catecholamines and acetylcholine (Berry, 1950; Zacks, 1954; Ignarro and Shideman, 1968). Despite the presence of regulatory components from both arms of the autonomic nervous system, at day 12 [60 % of the incubation period (60 %I) ] embryonic white leghorn chickens (Gallus gallus) possess only a tonic adrenergic stimulation of the cardiovascular system (Crossley and Altimiras, 2000). Several factors may dictate the timing of onset and subsequent effectiveness of cardiovascular regulatory mechanisms during chicken development. However, due to the lack of data from any avian species other than chickens, comparative hypotheses focusing on cardiovascular control during development cannot be evaluated...|$|E

In this study, we test the hypothesis that costs incurred during incubation may be an additional factor constraining clutch size in <b>altricial</b> <b>birds.</b> In the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca), we manipulated the incubation effort of the female by enlarging and reducing clutch sizes. To manipulate incubation effort only, the original clutch sizes were restored shortly after hatching. We found that fledging success was lower among broods whose clutches were enlarged during incubation. There was, however, no effect of manipulation on female body condition or on their ability to mount a humoral immune response to diphtheria or tetanus toxoid during the incubation or nestling provisioning pxeriod. Instead, we found that the original clutch size was related to the immune response so that females with seven eggs had significantly lower primary antibody responses against tetanus compared to those with six eggs. Our results suggest that incubating females are not willing to jeopardise their own condition and immune function, but instead pay the costs of incubating a larger clutch by lower offspring production. The results support the view that costs of producing and incubating eggs may be substantial and hence that these costs are likely to contribute to shaping the optimal clutch size in <b>altricial</b> <b>birds...</b>|$|R

Still, this effect is not an inevitable outcome of sibling competition, because several studies of other species of altricial birds have found the traditional pattern. We investigated if the sexes differ in environmental sensitivity during ontogeny in the blue tit, a small <b>altricial</b> <b>bird</b> with c. 6 % SSD in body mass (males larger than females). We performed a cross-fostering and brood size manipulation experiment during 2 years to investigate if the sexes were differently affected as regards body size (body mass, tarsus and wing length on day 14 after hatching) and pre-fledging survival. We also investigated if the relationship between body size and post-fledging survival differed between the sexes. Pre-fledging mortality was higher in enlarged than in reduced broods, representing poor and good environments, respectively, but the brood size manipulation did not affect the mortality rate of males and females differently. In both years, both males and females were smaller on day 14 after hatching in enlarged as compared to reduced broods. In one of the years, we also found significant Sex x Experiment interactions for body size, such that females were more affected by poor environmental conditions than that of males. Body size was positively correlated with post-fledging survival, but we found no interactive effects of sex and morphological traits on survival. We conclude that in the blue tit, females (the smaller sex) are more sensitive to adverse environmental conditions which, in our study, was manifest in terms of fledgling size. A review of published studies of sex differences in environmental sensitivity in sexually size-dimorphic altricial birds suggests that the smaller sex is more sensitive than the larger sex in species with large brood size and vice versa...|$|E

The most exact age is given {{by the size of the}} yolk sac, which indicates a probable age of three days, with an upper limit of a week. Despite its very young age, the hatchling was able to walk, as is shown by the complete ossification of the ilium. However, this does not imply Scipionyx was precocial as even with <b>altricial</b> <b>birds</b> this pelvis bone fully ossifies within a few days after hatching.|$|R
40|$|Visual co-orientation with another’s gaze {{direction}} (gaze following) {{may provide}} important {{information about the}} location of food, social interactions or predators. Gaze following {{has been shown in}} a variety of mammals, but only in few bird species, and has not been tested in precocial birds at all. It has been suggested that gaze following is an anti-predator behaviour, and in Common ravens (Corvus corax) and rooks (C. frugilegus), it emerges shortly after fledging, at a time when young birds leave the predator-safe nest. However, if gaze following is adaptive, the developmental pattern should differ between <b>altricial</b> and precocial <b>birds.</b> Greylag geese (Anser anser) are highly social birds with a precocial development. Goslings move and feed independently within 24 h post-hatching, and they are highly vulnerable to aerial predators. We therefore predicted that greylag geese are capable of gaze following and that they develop this skill already pre-fledging. We experimentally tested 19 hand-raised greylag goslings for their ability to follow a conspecific’s gaze when they were between 10 days and 6 weeks old. In line with our predictions, first responses were already detectable in 10 -day-old goslings. Our results therefore not only demonstrate that greylag geese follow the gaze of conspecifics into distant space, but that they also develop this ability much earlier than <b>altricial</b> <b>birds...</b>|$|R
40|$|Young {{birds and}} mammals are {{extremely}} vulnerable to predators and so should benefit from responding to parental alarm calls warning of danger. However, young often respond differently from adults. This difference may reflect: (i) an imperfect stage in the gradual development of adult behaviour or (ii) an adaptation to different vulnerability. <b>Altricial</b> <b>birds</b> provide an excellent model to test for adaptive changes with age in response to alarm calls, because fledglings are vulnerable to a different range of predators than nestlings. For example, a flying hawk is irrelevant to a nestling in a enclosed nest, but is dangerous to that individual once it has left the nest, so we predict that young develop a response to aerial alarm calls to coincide with fledging. Supporting our prediction, recently fledged white-browed scrubwrens, Sericornis frontalis, fell silent immediately after playback of their parents' aerial alarm call, whereas nestlings continued to calling despite hearing the playback. Young scrubwrens are therefore exquisitely adapted to the changing risks faced during development...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of thermoregulation in avian species {{is a complex}} matter in which neural as well as hormonal processes are involved. In a previous paper, the neural aspects of primary avian thermoregulation were discussed. In this paper {{the role of the}} hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis (HPT-axis) and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) in the ontogeny of avian thermoregulation is evaluated. The regulatory mechanisms and different important hormones of both axes, which have stimulatory or inhibitory effects, are discussed. Because the onset of functionality of the thermo regulatory system is of great interest, the ontogeny and functionality of the hormonal axes are clarified. There is a great difference between precocial and <b>altricial</b> <b>birds</b> in hormonal events as well as in neural processes which are involved in the {{emergence of}} thermoregulation. In precocial avian species the HPT-axis becomes functional during the mid- to late embryonic period while the same axis only becomes fully functional during the first week post-hatch in altricial avian species. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In <b>altricial</b> <b>birds,</b> nestlings usually {{respond to}} the sound and {{appearance}} of the provisioning adults by begging for food when the adults arrive at the nest. Nestlings can, however, also beg incorrectly on hearing misleading sounds in the environment and fail to beg when the adult arrives. This study uses the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus to test the hypotheses that nestling begging strategies {{are influenced by the}} reliability of the stimulus to beg, and that nestling motivational state affects the response to different stimuli. Here, we show experimentally that nestling hunger strongly influences the response to stimuli that vary in their reliability. While hunger increases begging rate, it also increases the likelihood that nestlings will beg when the parent is absent. This is in agreement with both the predictions of signal detection theory and recent empirical work on other species. We found, however, no evidence that age-related perceptual constraints influence the begging response of ten day old nestlings to different stimuli. ...|$|R
