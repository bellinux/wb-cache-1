40|$|Hyperglycemia in the {{diabetic}} state increases {{oxidative stress}} and antioxidant therapy can be strongly correlated with decreased risks for diabetic complications. The {{purpose of this}} study is to determine antioxidant effect of <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> aged black <b>garlic</b> in animal model of type 2 diabetes. The antioxidant activity of <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> aged black <b>garlic</b> was measured as the activity in scavenging free radicals by the trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay. Three week-old db/db mice were fed AIN- 93 G diet or diet containing 5 % freeze-dried garlic or aged black garlic for 7 weeks after 1 week of adaptation. Hepatic levels of lipid peroxides and activities of antioxidant enzymes were measured. TEAC values of <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> aged black <b>garlic</b> were 13. 3 ± 0. 5 and 59. 2 ± 0. 8 µmol/g wet weight, respectively. Consumption of aged black garlic significantly decreased hepatic thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) level compared with the garlic group which showed lower TBARS level than control group (p< 0. 05). Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) of <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> aged black <b>garlic</b> group were significantly elevated compared to the control group. Catalase (CAT) activity of aged black garlic group was increased compared with the control group. These results show that aged black garlic exerts stronger antioxidant activity than <b>garlic</b> in vitro <b>and</b> in vivo, suggesting <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> aged black <b>garlic,</b> to a greater extent, could be useful in preventing diabetic complications...|$|R
5|$|Warfarin also {{interacts with}} many herbs and spices, some used in food (such as ginger <b>and</b> <b>garlic)</b> and others used purely for {{medicinal}} purposes (such as ginseng and Ginkgo biloba). All may increase bleeding and bruising in people taking warfarin; similar effects {{have been reported}} with borage (starflower) oil or fish oils. St. John's Wort, sometimes recommended to help with mild to moderate depression, reduces {{the effectiveness of a}} given dose of warfarin; it induces the enzymes that break down warfarin in the body, causing a reduced anticoagulant effect.|$|E
5|$|White rot of onions, leeks, <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> {{is caused}} by the soil-borne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are {{attacked}} and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia, which later produces small, globular black structures called sclerotia. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{food items}} {{commonly}} consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters {{and should be}} avoided completely in captivity. After they are completely weaned at around 21 days of age, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are lactose intolerant and cannot digest milk. Onions <b>and</b> <b>garlic</b> are very dangerous and can cause severe haemolytic anemia. Leafy green vegetables such as cabbage and celery contain {{a large amount of}} water, so can have severe laxative effects on small animals. Grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, which can lead to death.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{experiment}} is to observe the antibacterial properties of cooked <b>and</b> uncooked crushed <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> the differences between cooked <b>and</b> uncooked crushed <b>garlic.</b> My research question was : “ Is there a significant mean difference between cooked <b>and</b> uncooked crushed <b>garlic</b> depending on the antibacterial effects. ” A significant mean difference between cooked <b>and</b> uncooked <b>garlic</b> is expected {{as a result of}} {{this experiment}}. According to the antibacterial characteristics, the most efficient one will be the uncooked crushed garlic. On the other hand, the cooked crushed garlic will not have a significant bactericidal characteristic. The Kirby-Bauer antibacterial testing method was prefered to conduct this experiment so as to test the hypothesis and to find the suitable answer for the research question. In laboratory conditions, incubation of Escherichia coli population was applied on Mueller-Hinton II agar plate. Filter paper disks were put onto the agar after being soaked in cooked <b>and</b> uncooked crushed <b>garlic.</b> The growth inhibition zone diameters were measured and by these diameters data analysis was done in order to investigate the differences between antibacterial characteristics of cooked <b>and</b> uncooked <b>garlic.</b> As a result, the filter paper disk soaked in uncooked crushed garlic had the largest diameter of the growth inhibition zone. In contrast, cooked crushed garlic had nearly no significant growth inhibition zone around the filter paper disk. Results of T-test statistics showed that uncooked crushed <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> cooked crushed <b>garlic</b> had <b>and</b> important maen differences in terms of their antibacterial effect on the tested microorganism named Escherichia coli, which is Gram negative bacteria...|$|R
