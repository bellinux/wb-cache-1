5|$|While the pay was {{relatively}} good, it still left many players {{looking for other}} jobs during the off-season, while the owners were all wealthy men. The conditions led to two organizing efforts at forming a player's union, which Smythe was vehemently against. From 1957 onwards, Smythe, along with other NHL owners including James D. Norris of the Chicago Black Hawks and his half brother Bruce Norris of the Detroit Red Wings were accused of union busting <b>activities</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the attempt by Ted Lindsay {{and a group of}} NHL players to form an NHL Players Association. Mr. Smythe's role in those affairs are dramatized in the movie, Net Worth. Jimmy Thomson, who was acting captain of the Maple Leafs when the players started to organize was singled out by Smythe. Smythe detailed all the monies Thomson had been paid by the organization going back to junior, while he arranged for Thomson to be left off the team, allegedly calling Thomson a traitor and publicly blaming him for the team's poor season. Thomson finally announced to the press that he would never play again for the Maple Leafs. Thomson and Tod Sloan were traded away to Chicago. The NHL owners eventually agreed to make some concessions to the players, such as contributing to the players' pensions. The owners were able to temporarily head off the formation of the union, although it would eventually be organized some ten years later.|$|E
