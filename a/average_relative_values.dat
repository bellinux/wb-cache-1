40|$|AIM: To {{establish}} a simple method to quantify muscle/fat constituents in cervical muscles of asymptomatic women using {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI), and {{to determine whether there}} is an age effect within a defined age range. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MRI of the upper cervical spine was performed for 42 asymptomatic women aged 18 - 45 years. The muscle and fat signal intensities on axial spin echo T 1 -weighted images were quantitatively classified by taking a ratio of the pixel intensity profiles of muscle against those of intermuscular fat for the rectus capitis posterior major and minor and inferior obliquus capitis muscles bilaterally. Inter- and intra-examiner agreement was scrutinized. RESULTS: The <b>average</b> <b>relative</b> <b>values</b> of fat within the upper cervical musculature compared with intermuscular fat indicated that there were only slight variations in indices between the three sets of muscles. There was no significant correlation between age and fat indices. There were significant differences for the relative fat within the muscle compared with intermuscular fat and body mass index for the right rectus capitis posterior major and right and left inferior obliquus capitis muscles (p = 0. 032). Intraclass correlation coefficients for intraobserver agreement ranged from 0. 94 to 0. 98. Inter-rater agreement of the measurements ranged from 0. 75 to 0. 97. CONCLUSION: A quantitative measure of muscle/fat constituents has been developed, and results {{of this study indicate that}} relative fatty infiltration is not a feature of age in the upper cervical extensor muscles of women aged 18 - 45 years.

40|$|Location, markets, {{hard surface}} roads and other {{transportation}} facilities, churches, taxes, schools, and utilities are major {{factors in the}} monetary value of land, yet these things do {{not contribute to the}} land’s productivity. In this bulletin the only factor considered in determining the agricultural value of land is its productive capacity. The three major factors in the productive value of land are water, climate, and soil. These three factors are the principal ones in crop production. If any one of them is unfavorable to plant growth, it can inhibit or even prevent plant growth regardless of how favorable the other factors may be. Productive capacity of land is no better than that permitted by any one of the three factors. Even if two of the factors are favorable, the land will not produce above the capacity of the third. This paper presents a system whereby the effect of soil, water, and climate upon the productive capacity of land can be more clearly understood and more easily evaluated. Not only can the system be used to evaluate the productive capacity, but also to identify factors which may be lowering the value of the land and to evaluate their relative importance. A number of factors that give value to land are rated. The values presented are <b>average</b> <b>relative</b> <b>values</b> which may need some modification before being applied in a specific locality. The authors have presented a philosophy of land evaluation built around scientific facts. They fully expect the values presented to be modified as further data becomes available – also, that additional graphical relationships will be developed for other quantities which have not been quantitatively evaluated in this presentation. This expansion and modification will come as the influence of these factors on agricultural value of land becomes clearer...|$|E

40|$|The main {{question}} asked {{of the work}} described in this thesis was howthe sawing of logs into sawn timber can be performed more efficientlywith respect to the choice of raw material, volume and value yield in thesawing and in the grading of the sawn timber produced. The development of industrial computed tomography scanning providesinformation about the external and internal properties of a sawlogat production speed. This opens up new possibilities of controlling theflow of raw material early {{in the process and}} of optimizing the breakdownof each sawlog. Another use of industrial computed tomography scanningis for predicting the strength of sawn timber better than is possible withcurrent visual and machine strength grading equipment. A more traditional way of increasing sawmill profitability is by increasingthe volume of sawn timber. One way of doing this is by reducing thesaw blade thickness which results in less sawdust. With the use of thinnersaw blades however there is a risk that the saw blades become misalignedwhich in turn leads to saw mismatch, an unevenness seen on the surfaceof the sawn timber. In this work, attempts were made to automaticallymeasure and monitor saw mismatch in a sawmill during ongoing production. It is also possible for a sawmill to increase its profitability by measuresnot related to the sawing process. One such example is customer adaptationwhen delivering the sawn timber. Different customers use the sawntimber for different purposes and consequently have different requirements,which is why the sawn timber produced is graded and sorted before it isdelivered to the customer. In this work, an alternative method for gradingsawn timber more efficiently using a multivariate method was developedand evaluated. The following results have been obtained:Log breakdowns of 716 Scots pine logs and 750 Norway spruce logsthat had been scanned using computed tomography were simulated andthe rotational position of each log was optimized. The results showedan <b>average</b> <b>relative</b> <b>value</b> increase of 16 % for appearance graded sawntimber compared to the conventional horns down position. When simulating log breakdowns of 677 Norway spruce logs with respect to visuallystrength graded sawn timber, an <b>average</b> <b>relative</b> <b>value</b> increase of 11 %was obtained. The effect that errors in knot detection algorithms had ona breakdown optimization was also analysed when optimizing breakdownof 57 Norway spruce sawlogs. The results showed that errors in the knotdiameter had the most severe impact on the <b>average</b> <b>relative</b> <b>value</b> increaseof a log rotation optimization, followed by errors in the dead knot border. The smallest effect was observed in the case of errors in rotational positionof the knots. Computed tomography scanning can also be used in a sawmill for log sorting in relation to different end-uses of the sawn timber. A simulationsoftware for cross-cutting optimization based on computed tomographydata was developed and it was shown that there was a reasonable correlationbetween these results and the results of an industrial system. Sincethe developed software can be combined with log breakdown simulationsbased on computed tomography data, it is evident that computed tomographycan be used to identify logs that would result in a poor volume yieldin the subsequent cross-cut optimization. Destructive bending strength tests were performed on 113 pieces of Norway spruce sawn timber. Multivariate models for predicting the bending strength of the sawn timber were created using computed tomography data of the sawlogs from which the sawn timber originated. The results showed that computed tomography scanning of logs produced prediction models of bending strength with a higher accuracy than discrete X-rayscanning. The main advantage was the detailed knot information {{that could be used in}} the prediction models. A method to measure saw mismatch automatically in a sawmill basedon laser triangulation was developed and the measurements were well correlatedwith manual measurements of saw mismatch. When laser triangulationwas used to measure saw mismatch in a sawmill, a distinguishabletrend of increasing magnitude and frequency of saw mismatch was observed. Finally, ways in which the sawn timber in a sawmill could be gradedand sorted more efficiently was investigated. It was found that by using agrading method based on multivariate techniques it is possible to increasethe proportion of higher sawn timber grades by up to 10 percentage points,which may increase sawmill profitability.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} relative efficiency of management and variation of managerial efficiency among 37 domestic banks in Taiwan. The relative efficiency of management is analysed through Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to estimate the competitiveness of each bank and managerial efficiency is to show the efficiency variation of each bank through Malmquist index. This article also links those two types of efficiency by constructing a matrix of relative efficiency and managerial efficiency defining of eight different categories of banks. The empirical results show that all 37 banks possess an <b>average</b> <b>relative</b> efficiency <b>value</b> of 0. 591, with a SD of 0. 228. And there are 6 banks with an efficiency value of 1. From the results estimated by Malmquist model, it indicates there are 20 banks with an efficiency variation greater than 1. This means that managerial efficiency of those 20 banks has been improving. However, there are 17 banks with an efficiency variation less than 1. This means that managerial efficiency of those 17 banks has been declining. ...|$|R

Primary outcomes included changes in monthly average ED length of stay (LOS), provider-specific <b>average</b> <b>relative</b> <b>value</b> units (RVUs) per hour (raw and normalized to volume), self-reported estimates of time spent teaching, self-reported estimates of time spent documenting, and job satisfaction. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and appropriate tests for paired pre-post differences in continuous, categorical, and ranked variables. Results: Pre- and post-survey response rates were 76. 1 % and 69. 0 %, respectively. Most responded positively to the intervention, although 9. 5 % reported negative impressions. There was a 36 % reduction (25 %- 50 %; p< 0. 01) in time spent documenting and a 30 % increase (11 %- 46 %, p< 0. 01) in time spent in direct patient contact. No statistically significant changes were seen in job satisfaction or perception of time spent teaching. ED volume increased by 88 patients per day (32 - 146, p= 0. 04) pre- to post- and LOS was unchanged; rates of patients leaving against medical advice dropped, and rates of patients leaving without being seen increased. RVUs per hour increased 5. 5 % and per patient 5. 3 %; both were statistically significant. No statistically significant changes were seen in patients seen per hour. There was moderate correlation between changes in ED volume and changes in productivity metrics. Conclusion: Scribes were well received in our practice. Documentation time was substantially reduced and redirected primarily to patient care. Despite an ED volume increase, LOS was maintained, with fewer patients leaving against medical advice but more leaving without being seen. RVUs per hour and per patient both increased. ...|$|R

40|$|Perched aquifer {{conditions}} often {{develop in}} the constrained zone overlying underground mines, due to dewatering of the mine workings. An inverted water table marks a transition from saturated un-fractured sandstone to an underlying unsaturated fractured zone. The objective {{of this research was}} to identify the relationship between vertical hydraulic conductivity (Kv), saturation (S) and suction (p) for a sandstone. An AllegraX‑ 15 R centrifuge was fitted with custom made drainage cells (n= 4) to test discs of sandstone (50 mm diameter, 5 mm thick) initially at > 95 % saturation with fresh water. The centrifuge speed was accelerated to provide increasing tension and drainage (300 to 2800 revolutions per minute), with the mass of drainage at the base of each cell measured after each acceleration step. The reduction of Kv with decreasing saturation (S) was observed for the sandstone (n = 8). On <b>average,</b> <b>relative</b> Kv <b>values</b> decreased by a factor of 10, as moisture content decreased from 16 % (at maximum saturation) to 13 %. For several sandstone samples, a small decrease in moisture content of 1 - 2 % was associated with a 50 % reduction in Kv values. An empirical relationship of the volumetric water content (V), V = 0. 015 e^ 0. 02 p (r 2 = 0. 9) was developed {{as a function of the}} suction (m H 2 O) applied within the centrifuge. To our knowledge this is the first time such relationships have been developed for consolidated rock. Further research is recommended to verify these observations and to model transient and non-linear drainage processes to calculate actual Kv values. These empirical relationships could be used to improve numerical models that include semi-saturated matrix flow processes. This research has demonstrated that partial desaturation significantly decreases the permeability and that the base of aquifers overlying mine workings can effectively become aquitards...|$|R
40|$|We {{establish}} a vulnerability analytical framework of CISN, and illustrate the impact path of economic fluctuation on CISN performance. Based on this, we propose an improved cascading failure model with directed weighted network, and design five network performance indicators (i. e., <b>relative</b> <b>value</b> of cascading failure, <b>average</b> path length, <b>relative</b> <b>value</b> of maximal connected sub-graphs, network efficiency, and structure entropy). Taking three coal eco-industrial parks in China as cases, we simulate {{and compare the}} impacts on CISN vulnerability (i. e., equality-based, dependent-based, and nested-based CISNs) of economic fluctuation. The {{results indicate that the}} interaction between economic fluctuation and network structure is the key factor in determining system vulnerability. Concerning overall vulnerability, equality-based CISN is highest, dependent-based CISN is next, and nested-based CISN is lowest. Regarding disturbance type, the changes in the five performance indicators of the three types of CISN are more intense under energy price shocks than with declining demand. Moreover, the cascading failure scale of equality-based CISN is greatest with declining demand, while the other two kinds of CISN’s is greatest under energy price shocks. Concerning disturbance intensity, equality-based CISN shows initial value sensitivity to economic fluctuation, and nested-based CISN has the strongest tolerances for economic fluctuation. From the network performance perspective, the performance of nested-based CISN is superior to that of dependent-based and equality-based CISNs. Due to longer average path length and lower network efficiency, the failure diffusion trend of equality-based CISN shows the curve of Type-S, and the diffusion rate is smooth and slow. Contrariwise, the initial diffusion rate of dependent-based CISN is the highest, indicating that the loss of system efficiency can somewhat improve the system’s anti-risk ability...|$|R
40|$|Decomposing litter {{accumulated}} on {{the soil}} surface in forests {{plays a major role}} in several ecosystem processes; its detailed characterization is therefore essential for thorough understanding of ecosystem functioning. In addition, litter is known to affect remote sensing radar data over forested areas and their proper processing requires accurate quantification of litter scattering properties. In the present study, ultrawideband (0. 8 – 2. 2 GHz) ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data were collected in situ for a wide range of litter types to investigate the potential of the technique to reconstruct litter horizons in undisturbed natural conditions. Radar data were processed resorting to full-wave inversion. Good agreement was generally found between estimated and measured litter layer thicknesses, with root-mean-square error values around 1 cm for recently fallen litter (OL layer) and around 2 cm for fragmented litter in partial decomposition (OF layer) and total litter (OL + OF). Nevertheless, significant correlations between estimated and measured thicknesses were found for total litter only. Inaccuracies in the reconstruction of the individual litter horizons were mainly attributed to weak dielectric contrasts amongst litter layers, with absolute differences in <b>relative</b> dielectric permittivity <b>values</b> often lower than 2 between humus horizons, and to uncertainties in the ground truth values. Radar signal inversions also provided reliable estimates of litter electromagnetic properties, with <b>average</b> <b>relative</b> dielectric permittivity <b>values</b> around 2. 9 and 6. 3 for OL and OF litters, respectively. These results are encouraging for the use of GPR for noninvasive characterization and mapping of forest litter. Perspectives for the application of the technique in biogeosciences are discussed...|$|R

Subsequently, we analyzed and compared the outcomes of the two groups by using a Semi-quantitative technique. The results of our analyses show that the <b>relative</b> <b>average</b> gray <b>value</b> of the blood cells' telomere PCR products of the adolescent group is higher than that of the matured group. These analytical results are indications that the blood cells' telomere DNA sequence of the adolescent Chinese alligators is longer than that of the matured Chinese alligators.

40|$|Many {{forms of}} judgments, {{such as those}} used in {{economic}} games or measures of social comparison, require understanding <b>relative</b> <b>value,</b> {{as well as the}} more complex ability to make comparisons between <b>relative</b> <b>values.</b> To examine whether young children can accu-rately compare <b>relative</b> <b>values,</b> we presented children 4 to 7 years with simple judgments of <b>relative</b> <b>value</b> in two scenarios. Children then were asked to compare the <b>relative</b> <b>values</b> in the two scenarios. Results show that even the youngest children downgraded evaluations of a reward when another has a larger amount, indicating the ability to make <b>relative</b> <b>value</b> judgments. When asked to compare <b>relative</b> <b>values</b> however, only the oldest children were able to make these comparisons consistently. We then extended this analysis to economic game performance. Specifically, previous results using economic games suggest that youn-ger children are more generous than older ones. We replicate this result, and then show that a simple change in procedure, based on the initial study, is sufficient to change young children’s choices. Our results strongly suggest that conclusions regarding young children’s pro-social motives based on <b>relative</b> <b>value</b> comparisons should be viewed cautiously...|$|R

40|$|Estimating {{turbulent}} diffusivity in estuaries is {{an important}} component to modelling scalar transport and mixing which can in-turn provide better insight for the management of coastal water environments. A Lagrangian approach has been used to investigate the horizontal dispersion of particles. Field experiments were conducted in a two inlet microtidal estuarine system known as Pumicestone Passage, which separates mainland Australia from Bribie Island. It is a body of water that spans a length of ∼ 45 km, an average width > 500 m and an average depth 2 - 3 m. The northern inlet opens to an unstable beach front with a width of 200 m and the southern inlet to Moreton Bay with a width of ∼ 800 m. Clusters of low resolution drifters were simultaneously deployed at both inlets of the estuary system over a tidal change. Pair particle statistics and finite scale Lyapunov exponents (FSLE) were employed to investigate relative dispersion. It was observed that higher levels of dispersion were presented in the southern inlet, with <b>average</b> <b>relative</b> diffusivity <b>values</b> of 0. 268 m 2 s − 1 and 0. 455 m 2 s − 1 for the northern and southern inlets, respectively. The analyses revealed that both inlets experience a ballistic regime before transferring into a diffusive regime. Furthermore, the southern inlet was observed to experience higher diffusivity values at smaller length scales, for example at a separation scale of 1 m the relative diffusivity is approximately 0. 146 m 2 s − 1 and 0. 195 m 2 s − 1 for the northern and southern inlets, respectively. This could be attributed to the unobstructed flow into Moreton bay and the higher marine traffic in the southern inlet. The FSLE analysis confirmed the existence of a diffusive regime. Relative diffusivity relations were developed for length scales for 1 - 6 m that could refine current hydrodynamic models of Pumicestone Passage and reveal the processes of mixing caused by turbulence...|$|R
