5000|$|Although the Pirates {{finished}} below [...]500 {{for another}} consecutive year, the team started the season strong {{and was in}} {{first place in the}} National League Central by the All-Star break. This {{was the first time the}} Pirates had finished above [...]500 at the All-Star Break since 1992. Much of the success was attributed to good starting pitching performances by Huntington <b>acquirees</b> Jeff Karstens, Charlie Morton, James McDonald, and the newly signed Kevin Correia. In the bullpen, Joel Hanrahan established himself as one of the top closers in the game. Though the offense struggled for most of the year, Andrew McCutchen emerged as one of the game's most exciting and promising young hitters, as well as the Pirates' best hitter. In July, Correia, Hanrahan, and McCutchen were all selected to play for the National League in the 2011 All Star Game. On June 8, the Pirates drafted UCLA pitcher Gerrit Cole with the first overall pick in 2011 Major League Baseball draft.|$|R
5000|$|An {{acquisition}} or takeover is {{the purchase}} of one business or company by another company or other business entity. Specific acquisition targets can be identified through a myriad of avenues including market research, trade expos, or sent up from internal business units, among others. Such purchase may be of 100%, or nearly 100%, of the assets or ownership equity of the acquired entity. Consolidation occurs when two companies combine {{to form a new}} enterprise altogether, and neither of the previous companies remains independently. Acquisitions are divided into [...] "private" [...] and [...] "public" [...] acquisitions, depending on whether the <b>acquiree</b> or merging company (also termed a target) is or is not listed on a public stock market. Some public companies rely on acquisitions as an important value creation strategy. [...] An additional dimension or categorization consists of whether an acquisition is friendly or hostile.|$|E
5000|$|Whether a {{purchase}} {{is perceived as}} being a [...] "friendly" [...] one or [...] "hostile" [...] depends significantly on how the proposed acquisition is communicated to and perceived by the target company's board of directors, employees and shareholders. It is normal for M&A deal communications {{to take place in}} a so-called [...] "confidentiality bubble" [...] wherein the flow of information is restricted pursuant to confidentiality agreements. In the case of a friendly transaction, the companies cooperate in negotiations; {{in the case of a}} hostile deal, the board and/or management of the target is unwilling to be bought or the target's board has no prior knowledge of the offer. Hostile acquisitions can, and often do, ultimately become [...] "friendly", as the acquiror secures endorsement of the transaction from the board of the <b>acquiree</b> company. This usually requires an improvement in the terms of the offer and/or through negotiation.|$|E
40|$|The {{accounting}} for business combinations {{is a very}} important area, therefore it needs a high quality accounting standard {{that could be used for}} both domestic and cross-border financial reporting. IASB issued in January 2008 the revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations, which aims to help both users and preparers of the consolidated financial statements by improving the relevance, reliability and comparability of the information reported by companies around the world. This article aims to highlight few significant changes in the accounting treatment of business combinations that have arisen from the revised IFRS 3, focusing on the accounting principles surrounding the recognition and measurement of the identifiable net assets of the <b>acquiree</b> and any non-controlling interest in the <b>acquiree</b> and on the implications for calculating and measuring goodwill. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{results from}} this paper provide mixed {{conclusions}} as {{to the existence of}} operating gains for a sample of 191 UK takeovers between 1985 and 1993. The existence of gains is found {{to be sensitive to the}} benchmark adopted for evaluating post-takeover performance. If this benchmark is some pro-forma combined measure of <b>acquiree</b> and acquirer pre-takeover performance, the results fail to show any significant improvement in post-takeover operating performance, although no decline either. If, on the other hand, we adopt the Healy, Palepu and Ruback (1992) regression-based methodology, allowing the benchmark to resemble some multiple of pre-takeover performance, the results show significant and positive improvements in operating performance. The {{results from this}} paper serve to cast some light on the non-trivial methodological issues involved in constructing pre-takeover benchmarks of <b>acquiree</b> and acquirer operating performance.

40|$|A common {{feature of}} the {{literature}} on post-acquisition changes is its dyadic feature, i. e. the emphasis is placed on the actors directly involved in the acquisition, often represented by the <b>acquiree</b> and the acquirer. Accordingly, actors outside the dyad, such as suppliers and buyers, are usually disregarded. There is, however, a relevant exception in this literature. Recently, some Nordic authors have claimed that if actors other than the <b>acquiree</b> and the acquirer are not taken into account, the existing literature may only present a partial view of changes following acquisitions. Consequently, they have suggested that changes following this type of operation can be analysed fruitfully at the network level. Our article adds to the efforts of these scholars to understand post-acquisition changes at a broader level by bringing to the fore two issues that have received scarce attention in the literature: i) nets rather than the network level appears to be the locus where post-acquisition changes beyond the dyad take place; ii) relational power can be regarded as an independent variable in post-acquisition changes beyond the dyad. These arguments are illustrated by three brief case studies of cross-border acquisitions. Key words: network; post-acquisition changes; dyad; relational power...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores some of {{the ways}} in which {{accounting}} may affect the power relationships between two organisations, and how accounting can be 2 involved in organisational reconstruction. The empirical basis of the paper is a study of a cross-border acquisition in the former German Democratic Republic. In this particular case, a Swedish construction combine introduced decentralised and project based accounting practices in an acquired German firm as part of an overall reform programme aiming for competitiveness and an increased identification with the acquirer. One conclusion of the analysis is that the new accounting practices helped establish a principal-agent relationship between the acquirer and the <b>acquiree,</b> i. e. a relationship where organisational members considered it natural for the German firm to be governed by the Swedish one. Another conclusion is that internal power relationships were transformed. Project accounting furthered a redrawing of internal boundaries and promoted a redefinition of individual as well as organisational identities. As the cross-border acquisition theme implies, the paper can also be read as tal...|$|E
40|$|We study a {{homogenous}} good triopoly {{in which}} firms first choose their cost-reducing R&D investments and consider alternative merger proposals, and then compete à la Cournot {{in the ensuing}} industry. We identify conditions under which both horizontal mergers and non integration are sustained by Coalition-Proof Nash equilibria (CPNE). These conditions involve {{the effectiveness of the}} R&D technology, as well as the distribution of the bargaining power between the acquirer and the <b>acquiree,</b> which determine the allocation of the incremental profits generated by the merger. We show that whether firms follow duplicative or complementary research paths, sustaining a merger generally requires a sufficiently effective R&D technology that creates endogenous cost asymmetries and renders the merger profitable, and a moderate distribution of bargaining power that allows to spread the benefits of the merger. We examine the welfare effects of mergers and obtain clear policy guidelines.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{means of}} payment in over 2, 500 acquisitions in the UK and US over the period 1955 to 1985. Data on financing proportions, bid premia and postmerger performance are {{used to test the}} validity of tax and information hypotheses. It is difficult to explain many of the results in terms of tax effects. Capital gains tax {{does not appear to be}} a primary determinant of financing patterns in the UK in a period in which there were substantial variations in the tax rate. As well the tax motivated "trapped equity" model is inconsistent with several observations on financing patterns. In both countries much larger <b>acquiree</b> bid premia are associated with cash than equity bids, consistent with information models suggesting that high valuing bidders make cash offers and low valuing bidders make securities offers. Even after controlling for the form of takeover (tender versus merger) and whether the bid is contested, cash offers provide substantially higher wealth gains to target shareholders. In the US bidders using all equity suffer significant abnormal losses at the time of the bid announcement consistent with the findings on the wealth effects of seasoned new equity offerings in the US. In the UK, however, no such losses are evident, perhaps reflecting the fact that in the UK equity bids are typically underwritten. Finally, we find that acquirors making cash offers have better postmerger shareprice performance than do those using equity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that bidders are motivated to use overvalued equity to acquire other firms. ...|$|E
40|$|When buying {{enterprises}} as {{a property}} complex, firm-the buyer {{can pay for}} it as excess cost of the acquired entity on its balance sheet, and an amount less than {{the value of the}} assets on the balance sheet of the <b>acquiree.</b> Based on the requirements of the Russian legislation, in the account of the buyer acquires an intangible asset that distinguishes the Russian from the international practice. International financial reporting standards do not recognize goodwill an intangible asset of the buyer enterprise. Therefore, it is necessary to specify the Russian practice of accounting transactions in the purchase of enterprises as property complex. The article presents a definition of the property complex, based on the requirements of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, highlighted the stages of transfer of the property complex of the specified accounting documents that must be decorated, the analysis of the approaches of domestic and foreign authors to the recognition and measurement of goodwill, studied the specificity of the requirements of the Russian normative-legislative acts to the category “goodwill”, “intangible asset”. Based on the requirements of the Russian legislation, a positive goodwill is recognized in intangible asset (goodwill), in contrast to the negative goodwill (badwill), which immediately applies on other income of the organisation – the buyer of the enterprise – a property complex. On the positive business reputation, then the requirements of the Russian legislation, a positive goodwill is recognized intangible asset. In this paper, the authors proposed a model accounting for the purchase of enterprise as property complex as a result of which the acquisition price of an enterprise as a property complex exceeds its carrying amount of the assessment, therefore, in accounting, the buyer acquires an intangible asset {{in the form of a}} positive business reputation, compiled and substantiated recommended to reflect this fact of financial and economic activities of the correspondence of accounts...|$|E
40|$|Mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M&As) {{have been seen}} as an important strategy in helping organizations to grow, gain access to new markets and resources, increase efficiency, and enable competitiveness in order to fulfil the purpose of the organization. These aspects have made M&As of central interest to academic literature. In co-operative studies mergers especially have been widely studied. The common focus of these studies is that M&As have taken place between organizations of the same form. It is noteworthy that there is a scarcity of literature concerning acquisitions between different organizational types. Moreover, M&As have not been evaluated concerning the organization’s ownership and purpose, which may be significant integration factors. The overall objective {{of this study is to}} describe and understand why co-operative organizations use acquisition as a strategic alternative. In more detail – and in order to develop understanding of the background ideals affecting the acquisition decision and the differences of organization ideals in the integration process – this study is based on a qualitative case study approach. By combining interview data gathered from the OPPohjola Group and associating the observations from various streams of research on acquisitions and management with the purpose of co-operation, and examining these issues further, the thesis contributes to the elaboration of theory in the field of the strategic management of co-operatives. The dissertation consists of two parts. The first part introduces the research topic, methods and publications, as well as discussing the overall outcomes. The second part consists of four publications that address the research questions from different viewpoints. The analyses of this dissertation indicate that, from the strategic point of view, the acquisition of an investor-owned firm by a co-operative organization may create competitive advantage for the co-operative. On the other hand, there are differences in and following from the purpose of acquirer and the <b>acquiree</b> that may, in such case, pose several challenges to the integration process...|$|E
40|$|Background and Problematization: Increased {{globalization}} {{has created a}} larger demand for a harmonization within accounting areas. The new accountancy standard, which is called IFRS, emphasizes that companies, to a larger extent than before in Sweden, make their own judgements of economic events. With {{the introduction of the}} IFRS standards, the purpose is to show the true and fair value of a company. One of the most significant changes has taken place within the regulation that concerns Business combinations which is denominated the IFRS 3 standard. When the IFRS 3 was introduced, companies quoted on the Swedish stock market became obliged to specify, to a larger extent than before, the acquired intangible assets instead of accounting them as part of goodwill. A problem seen from the external shareholder’s decision-making point of view is the fact that different entities allocate various amounts and percentages of the total acquisition cost. While some entities assign the total acquisition cost as goodwill, others assign {{only a small fraction of}} the total amount. Purpose: The purpose of this report has been to examine how companies reasoned and effected the allocation of the net acquisition cost between different assets and goodwill when acquiring companies. An additional purpose has been to illuminate how companies’ allocation of acquisition cost affects analysts’ opinions of the accounting information. Choice of method: The authors have conducted a qualitative study based on interviews. An investigation on how three selected companies reasoned when applying the IFRS 3 rules concerning allocation of acquisition cost between assets has been effected. Result and conclusions: There are several different reasons why allocation of acquisition cost differs between companies. Synergy effects, the acquirers’ size relative to the <b>acquiree</b> and result management incentives are all possible explanations as to why differences exist. Regarding the second question, the authors have come to the conclusion that analysts are far more interested in cash flows and as a result, effects from the transition on analysts have been quite limited. Further research within the area: The authors claim that it would be interesting to conduct a similar study within a few years to see the effects of time and experience regarding the application of the IFRS 3 regulation. Also, an investigation on the effects of a future recession on contingent impairments would be of interest...|$|E
