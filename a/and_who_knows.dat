500|$|... "Better in Time" [...] is a pop and R song {{performed}} by British singer Leona Lewis. It {{was written by}} J. R. Rotem and Andrea Martin, and was produced by Rotem. It is featured on Lewis's debut album Spirit (2007). [...] "Better in Time" [...] was released on 10 March 2008 as Lewis's third single in the United Kingdom, as a double A-side with [...] "Footprints in the Sand", and [...] "You Bring Me Down" [...] as B-side. It was Lewis's second international single following her hit [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] (2007).

500|$|While Michael Cerveris has {{appeared}} as the Observer {{in the three}} previous episodes—and {{has appeared}} in every episode to date—his previous appearances had been brief background cameos. When initially cast for Fringe, Cerveris assumed he was a mere guest star, and that his character was [...] "one of several nuggets dropped in" [...] by J.J. Abrams {{in a manner similar}} to his other science fiction series, Lost. Cerveris soon discovered that his character was [...] "this sort of Where's Waldo thing (as) the linchpin in an overarching story of the series". He continued: Executive producer Jeff Pinkner commented, [...] "Our goal was to take a character who is by definition unknowable and make him someone you can connect to emotionally. He's more specifically connected with the overall character mythology of the show than we ever expected." [...] The decision to remove his eyebrows was made an hour before he first appeared, which caused stress in the make-up department because Cerveris would not shave his eyebrows; he commented about the affair, [...] "I've got a little too much else going on, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> if they would ever grow back. I have little enough hair as it is." [...] "The Arrival" [...] was the first episode in which the Observer had dialogue, and the first in which he was treated as a focal character. In addition to Cerveris, actor Michael Kelly made a guest appearance in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Niffenegger {{began writing}} the novel in 1997; the last scene, {{in which an}} aged Clare is waiting for Henry, was written first, {{because it is the}} story's focal point. The {{narrative}} was originally structured thematically. Responding to comments from readers of early drafts of the manuscript, Niffenegger reorganized the narrative so that it largely followed Clare's timeline. The work was finished in 2001. With no history of commercial publication, Niffenegger had trouble finding interested literary agents—25 rejected the manuscript. In 2002, she sent it unsolicited to the small, San Francisco-based publisher MacAdam/Cage, where it reached Anika Streitfeld. Streitfeld, who became Niffenegger's editor, [...] "thought it was incredible. Right from the very beginning you feel like you are in capable hands, that this is someone who has a story to tell <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> how to tell it." [...] She gave it to David Poindexter, the founder of the publishing firm, [...] "who read it overnight and decided to buy the book". However, Niffenegger had acquired an agent by this time, and several publishing houses in New York City were interested in the novel. The manuscript was put up for auction and MacAdam/Cage bid US$100,000, by far the largest sum it had ever offered for a book. Although another publisher outbid them, Niffenegger selected MacAdam/Cage because they were so dedicated to her work. Also, Niffenegger explains that her [...] "own natural inclination is to go small. My background is in punk music—I'd always pick the indie company over the giant corporation." ...|$|E

She also questions the shallowness of modern life and the [...] "American dream." [...] "I know it sounds clichéd," [...] she admitted. [...] "But I've had 20 years of fame and fortune, and I feel that I {{have the right to}} an opinion on what it is and isn't. All everyone is obsessed about now is being a celebrity.

Before it happens, you have all kinds of notions about how wonderful celebrity is and how much joy it's going to bring you. Then you arrive... In America, more than any other place in the world, you have the freedom to be anything you want to be. Which is all well and good, but it only works if you have a value system – and we seem not to have one anymore. It's, 'Whatever it takes to get to the top, that's what you gotta do.' It's the allure of the beautiful life: 'Look like this, you're gonna be happy. Drive this car, you're gonna be popular. Wear these clothes and people are gonna want to fuck you.' It's a very powerful illusion and people are caught up in it, including myself. Or I was." ...|$|E

500|$|Wizards & Warriors has {{received}} scant coverage from modern video gaming websites. Video gaming website GamesRadar named the opening {{theme for the}} game as [...] "Game music of the day", noting that the theme [...] "suggests, from the moment {{you turn on the}} game, that knights, wizards, goblins <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> what else are about to collide in a battle so epic it's destined for a Frazetta painting." [...] JC Fletcher from Joystiq called the game [...] "a simple action-platformer about a guy in thick armor who kicks open treasure chests in order to bribe knights". He also notes the variety of good and bad items such as the [...] "Staff of Power" [...] which inflicts much damage to enemies and conversely the [...] "Cloak of Darkness", which he says [...] "makes Kuros invisible to you but not to enemies". He said that the game has an arcade feel, with unlimited continues, a high-score list, name entry for high scores, and good music. Houston Press Jef Rouner lauded the game's music and animation, and noted its high difficulty level, especially during boss battles. IGN listed Wizards & Warriors at #56 on its [...] "Top 100 NES Games" [...] list, reviewer Sam Claiborn said that the game was inspired by Dungeons & Dragons-type RPGs, but it went further in incorporating action platforming elements along with more traditional RPG elements. Columnist and comedy writer Seanbaby humorously criticized the game for items that did not work as intended, including the [...] "Cloak of Darkness" [...] and the [...] "Boots of Lava Walk".|$|E

[...] In an interview with media website Digital Spy, Santer discussed the reasoning behind his decision to reintroduce Sam: [...] "What makes Sam interesting for me is that she's Ricky's first love and first wife. As Bianca and Ricky spend more time together [...] the inevitability of them at some point coming together increases. What's stopping them? Well, it's Sam. Sam and Ricky had a good thing going all those years ago.

2500|$|On a little-endian system, the bytes {{are written}} {{from left to}} right in {{increasing}} significance, starting with the one's byte: 0Dh at +0, 0Ch at +1, 0Bh at +2, 0Ah at +3. Writing a 32-bit binary value to a memory location on a little-endian system and outputting the memory location (with growing addresses {{from left to right}}) shows that the order is reversed (byte-swapped) compared to usual big-endian notation. This is the way a hexdump is displayed: because the dumping program is unable to know what kind of data it is dumping, the only orientation it can observe is monotonically increasing addresses. The human reader, however, who knows {{that he or she is}} reading a hexdump of a little-endian system <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> what kind of data he or she is reading, reads the byte sequence 0Dh,0Ch,0Bh,0Ah as the 32-bit binary value 168496141, or 0x0a0b0c0d in hexadecimal notation.
