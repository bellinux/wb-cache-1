25|$|After {{suffering}} from mental disorders for several years, Kiki committed suicide {{on the night}} of December 23, 1946, jumping out of a window of her fifth-floor apartment in the Stanhope Hotel of New York City and landing in a courtyard of the hotel. According to her companion, Lillian Turner, Kiki had been in poor health, depressed and nervous. Turner had just given Preston a glass of milk and then went into {{the living room of the}} apartment to read. When she heard no sounds coming from Kiki's bedroom, she entered it, only to find a window open and Kiki gone. Kiki's pajama-clad body was soon discovered in an <b>areaway</b> behind the hotel. Preston's mother, Helen Steele, was also living at the same hotel at the time. Today, Kiki's home on Lake Naivasha is inhabited by the 7th Earl of Enniskillen.|$|E
500|$|The White House to Treasury Building tunnel is a [...] {{subterranean}} {{structure in}} Washington, D.C. that connects a sub-basement of the East Wing of the White House to the <b>areaway</b> which surrounds the United States Treasury Building. It was originally constructed in 1941 {{to allow the}} evacuation of the president from the White House to underground vaults inside the Treasury {{in the event of}} an emergency.|$|E
500|$|As a stop-gap measure, the {{fortified}} vaults in {{the basement}} of the United States Treasury Building were converted into living quarters for the president and his family, to be used in the event an attack came prior to the bunker's completion. Unlike the White House, which was a fragile structure with what was then a shallow basement, the Treasury Building has a deep basement built into a foundation of granite and its vaults are nested into stone. The ten-room presidential suite sat two floors below the cash room behind a steel bank door and was described as [...] "every bit as nice as a suite at the Mayflower Hotel". The tunnel, connecting the White House to the open <b>areaway</b> of the Treasury Building, was excavated to allow the evacuation of the president from one building to the other without the need to make the crossing outdoors.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{bordered on}} all sides by public streets and sidewalks. Grading slopes {{downhill}} from the front (SE) on Capital Street to the rear (NE) on Fourth Street. On the east elevation the grade is lowered to partially expose the granite base course and basement windows; on the west elevation the grade level was maintained at the first floor level and the basement is lighted by <b>areaways</b> along the west side. Landscaping generally consists of a lawn border along the west, south and east elevations with two large evergreens flanking each front entry (the easternmost tree of the east entry has been lost), and assorted shrubs at the corners. Original Deco lighting standards flank all the entries of the 1932 and 1941 elevations.|$|R
50|$|The {{sidewalls}} of {{the auditorium}} were reconfigured to hold foot-thick concrete shear panels the volume of which could have lessened its reverberant character. New wall openings, cut into abandoned rooftop <b>areaways,</b> are enclosed by new structure to form operable acoustic galleries allow variable acoustic responses. Along with new ceiling coves, the galleries increase {{the volume of the}} hall by 40,000 cubic feet and lengthen its reverberation period by over a second at their maximum setting. Skylights in the gallery restore natural light to the spectacular coffered ceiling, now for the first time, brightly illuminated. Unlike the former plaster interior, the new walls are clad in brick and terra cotta identical to that on the original exterior of the building. The uneven texture of projecting blocks improves sound diffusion. Its pattern is abstracted from Lombard Romanesque motifs in Lucca and other cities in the valley of the Po River in northern Italy.|$|R
5000|$|The {{courthouse}} is {{a three-story}} red brick, Classical Revival style building with limestone trim. It {{consists of an}} original 1937 building, 151' wide, flanked by two 63' wide symmetrical projecting wings added in 1964. The wings are only two stories high, which leaves the original building rising {{in the center of}} the elevation. Limestone detailing is simple and concentrated on the original building elevation. Red brick in a common bond pattern rises from a smooth finish limestone base; a series of six engaged pilasters, with Doric capitals, rise two stories above the first floor base to a plain, 5' high limestone cornice and frieze which borders the entire building, except the rear light court. The words [...] "UNITED STATES POST OFFICE AND COURT HOUSE" [...] are incised into the entablature. There is also limestone trim around the three central entry doors, limestone window sills and lintels, and a limestone stair platform with plinths or cheekwalls, all smooth-finished. A long handicapped ramp with a return visually dominates the approach to the main entry. It is bounded by iron rails which match the ones on the original <b>areaways</b> flanking the entrance.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Arty Ferrard's {{house is}} a poor {{relation}} {{to most of the}} residences there. The black <b>areaway</b> rail is broken, and the basement-door grill is rusty. But at the windows are red-and-white-figured chintz curtains, with a $2.98 bisque figurine of an unclothed lady between them; the door is of spotless white, with a bell-pull of polished brass.|$|E
60|$|For {{three hours}} he writhed on that door-step, till {{he came to}} hate it; it {{was as much a}} prison as his room at the Zapps' had been. He hated the <b>areaway</b> grill, and a big brown spot on the pavement, and, as a truck-driver hates a motorman, so did he hate a pudgy woman across the street who peeped out from a second-story window and watched him with cynical interest. He finally could endure no longer the world's criticism, as {{expressed}} by the woman opposite. He started as though he were going to go right now to some place he had been intending to go to all the time, and stalked away, ignoring the woman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure is a junk heap, {{this old}} block," [...] {{observed}} Pepper, as he fumbled {{in the dim}} light with his keys. At length he opened a door, turned on a light and led Lane into his apartment. [...] "I have three rooms here, and the back one opens into a kind of <b>areaway</b> from which I get into an abandoned storeroom, or I guess it's an attic. To-morrow afternoon about three you meet me here and I'll take you in there and let you have a look through the peep-hole I made. It's no use to-night, because there'll be only boys at the club, and I'm going to take you right in." ...|$|E
6000|$|The flat was hot, dead. The {{summer heat}} was unrelenting as bedclothes drawn {{over the head}} and lashed down. Flies in sneering circles mocked the {{listless}} hand she flipped at them. Too hot to wear many clothes, yet hating the disorder of a flimsy negligée, she panted by a window, while the venomous sun glared on tin roofs, and {{a few feet away}} snarled the ceaseless trrrrrr of a steam-riveter that was erecting new flats to shut off their view of the Hudson. In the lava-paved back yard was the insistent filelike voice of the janitor's son, who kept piping: [...] "Haaay, Bil-lay, hey; Billy's got a girl! Hey, Billy's got a girl! Haaay, Bil-lay!" [...] She imagined herself going down and slaughtering him; vividly saw herself waiting for the elevator, venturing into the hot sepulcher of the back <b>areaway,</b> and there becoming too languid to complete the task of ridding the world of the dear child. She was horrified to discover what she had been imagining, and presently imagined it all over again.|$|E
50|$|A {{subterranean}} lightwell at {{the front}} of a building to provide light to a basement is called an area (or <b>areaway</b> in North American usage).|$|E
50|$|In architecture, an area (<b>areaway</b> in North America) is an excavated, {{subterranean}} {{space around}} {{the walls of}} a building, designed to admit light into a basement, often providing access to the house for tradesmen and deliveries and access to vaults beneath the pavement for storage of coal and ash.|$|E
5000|$|Also provocative was Reichmuthps {{painting}} of a vicious, smoking pope and the performance, that included hanging laundry {{on a lot of}} wires through the <b>areaway</b> of the university. In German, there is a figure of speech that says [...] "dreckige Wäsche zu waschen" [...] ("to wash dirty laundry").|$|E
50|$|The White House to Treasury Building tunnel is a 761 ft {{subterranean}} {{structure in}} Washington, D.C. that connects a sub-basement of the East Wing of the White House to the <b>areaway</b> which surrounds the United States Treasury Building. It was originally constructed in 1941 {{to allow the}} evacuation of the president from the White House to underground vaults inside the Treasury {{in the event of}} an emergency.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} is divided horizontally into three parts. The main façade, on Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., Boulevard, {{is divided into}} five parts vertically as well, having slightly projecting central and end pavilions. The two-story rusticated base, consisting of limestone set in alternating wide and narrow horizontal bands which show only the horizontal joints, has simple rectangular [...] and rises above an <b>areaway</b> with molded watertable and wrought-iron railing.|$|E
5000|$|... 23 and 25 Second Street: This pair {{of brick}} houses, {{built in the}} late 1840s, {{demonstrate}} the transition between the Greek Revival and Italianate styles. Their denticulated cornices, {{a hallmark of the}} former, are supported by the wooden brackets commonly associated with the latter. The houses are distinguished by a Gothic Revival railing around the <b>areaway</b> at 23 along with almost flush lintels and sills, in contrast to the door pediment and projecting sills of 25.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} is a three story E-shaped building featuring a raised basement, shallow projecting corner pavillions, and a gabled tile roof. The structural system {{is composed of}} a concealed steel frame and concrete floors. At the east, south, and west elevations the building is surrounded by raised terrace separated from the exterior walls by an <b>areaway.</b> The principal exterior building materials consist of marble on the east, south, and west facades; limestone within the two courtyards; and stucco on the north facades of {{the east and west}} wings.|$|E
50|$|The {{basement}} finishes {{are similar}} to the other floors, except that the finish under the vinyl flooring is concrete, and lay-in ceilings have not been installed. Some of the original oak doors, frames, and transoms are intact, but have been painted white. Between the old Postal Swing Room and the toilet facilities, the observation <b>areaway</b> and viewports are still intact. At all levels the toilets mostly are still intact in the form in which they were revised during the 1936 remodel. The toilet partitions and wainscoting are marble. The period ceramic fixtures have nickel fixtures and fittings.|$|E
50|$|With {{funding from}} the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the {{building}} was renovated in 1983 as affordable housing with A. Ingre and Associates as the project designers. The residential units are now managed by the Affordable Housing Society. A beer parlour formerly existed below the ground floor, which included areaways extending underneath the above sidewalks. To prevent a cave-in from the weight of pedestrians and above ground traffic, the City of Vancouver filled the <b>areaway</b> in with pea gravel {{at a cost of}} $215,000, which presumably can be easily removed in the event of future restoration.|$|E
5000|$|Then I {{saw that}} I wasn't {{standing}} on the stone of the stoop but {{on a piece of}} glass, and if I didn't like that piece there were plenty of others. They were all over the stoop, the steps, the <b>areaway,</b> and the sidewalk. I looked straight up, and another piece came flying down, missed me by a good inch, and crashed and tinkled at my feet. I backed across the sill, shut the door, and turned to face Wolfe, who was standing in the hall looking bewildered."He took it out on the orchids," [...] I stated.

50|$|No {{large-scale}} occupancy relocations {{have occurred}} {{and the building}} has retained most of its original functions, maintaining the stability of its connection with the community. The first floor post office, third floor courtrooms and judicial spaces, {{as well as many}} of the offices, still serve the purposes for which they were intended. Though modifications to the postal screen walls were made twice within eight years of construction, the building did not undergo significant change until new air conditioning, plaster soffits, and suspended fluorescent fixtures were added to judicial rooms in 1957. The following year a conveyor <b>areaway</b> and stair were added leading to the basement on the Arkansas side. The 1970s brought more changes to the postal screen walls, as well as the insensitive addition of air conditioning equipment and ductwork with suspended acoustic tile ceilings to the offices on floors two through five. It is critical {{to the life of the}} building that its current functions be maintained.|$|E
40|$|Snow {{controls}} {{were employed to}} reduce snow drifts around buildings and a main road {{during the period of}} the 53 rd Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE- 53) wintering party at Syowa Station. Snow and ice that accumulated under the elevated <b>areaway</b> of a sewage treatment building were removed and a blower fence was erected. Wind passages under highfloored buildings were maintained by cutting openings through snow drifts that developed on the leeward side of the buildings. Empty drums were useful as wind ducts to prevent snow drifts from accumulating in front of doors of small huts. Snow removed from along a main road was relocated on the leeward side of the road to prevent the subsequent accumulation of snow drifts...|$|E
