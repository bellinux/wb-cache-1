5|$|The Moon's orbit intersects {{with the}} {{ecliptic}} {{at the two}} nodes that are 180 degrees apart. Therefore, the new moon occurs close to the nodes at two periods of the year approximately six months (173.3 days) apart, known as eclipse seasons, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> always be at least one solar eclipse during these periods. Sometimes the new moon occurs close enough to a node during two consecutive months to eclipse the Sun on both occasions in two partial eclipses. This means that, in any given year, {{there will always be}} at least two solar eclipses, and there can be as many as five.|$|E
5|$|Two hazards {{are uniquely}} {{identified}} with the dam. One is that sedimentation projections are not agreed upon, {{and the other is}} that the dam sits on a seismic fault. At current levels, 80% of the land in the area is experiencing erosion, depositing about 40million tons of sediment into the Yangtze annually. Because the flow is slower above the dam, much of this sediment will now settle there instead of flowing downstream, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be less sediment downstream.|$|E

5|$|Another {{reason is}} the {{protection}} of star players. Fighting within the game can also {{send a message to}} players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players will not be tolerated <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is known to be a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by Dave Semenko, Marty McSorley, and others, and Brett Hull, who was protected by Kelly Chase and others. Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{plans for}} the station were for access to be from Monmouth Road, which runs {{parallel}} to the railway, north of the line. There {{was to be a}} fully accessible footbridge across the line, with both ramp and stairs, as well as a pedestrian crossing across Monmouth Road and a lit 50-space car park on the old goods yard at the eastern end of Monmouth Road. The very end of the goods yard would be maintained for Network Rail access. These plans were changed following an agreement to acquire a property on Station Road. The new plans have the entrance to be on Station Road, at the east end of the site, meaning there would be no need for a footbridge. There would be disabled parking and a pick up/drop off point adjacent to the entrance, although the exact design of this area is still under consideration. Noise mitigation options are to be investigated <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be improvements to local footpaths. The line is due to reopen in 2020.|$|E
5|$|No single {{method for}} {{confirming}} tracheal tube placement {{has been shown}} to be 100% reliable. Accordingly, the use of multiple methods for confirmation of correct tube placement is now widely considered to be the standard of care. Such methods include direct visualization as the tip of the tube passes through the glottis, or indirect visualization of the tracheal tube within the trachea using a device such as a bronchoscope. With a properly positioned tracheal tube, equal bilateral breath sounds will be heard upon listening to the chest with a stethoscope, and no sound upon listening to the area over the stomach. Equal bilateral rise and fall of the chest wall will be evident with ventilatory excursions. A small amount of water vapor will also be evident within the lumen of the tube with each exhalation <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be no gastric contents in the tracheal tube at any time.|$|E

5|$|Afterward, Andy grows {{determined}} {{to escape from}} Shawshank, and informs Red {{that he is going}} to Zihuatanejo in Mexico, telling him that if he should ever get out of prison, he should go to a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be a volcanic rock, and a gift for him under it. During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In a fury, Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of David Cassidy on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing a hole through Cassidy's rectum. Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of Friends, allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a parole board and complains that the concept of rehabilitation is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; for no apparent reason, Red is put on parole anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in Zihuatanejo, eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red never does.|$|E
5|$|Banksia cuneata lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, this species is {{strongly}} serotinous: seed is released only following a fire. Thus plants accumulate an aerial seed bank in fire intervals, which is released all at once after a fire, ensuring population regeneration. The mechanism is a resin that seals the follicles shut, preventing dehiscence; {{the heat of a}} bushfire melts the resin, and the follicles open. Intense fires cause the immediate release of the seed and seed separator, but after cooler fires the seed separator often remains in place, blocking the follicle exit and preventing seed release. The wings on the seed separator are hygroscopic; they draw together when moistened, then reflex out again as they dry. Thus they lever themselves, and the seeds, out of the follicle over the course of one or more wet-dry cycles, ensuring that seed is released only after rain has fallen. The juvenile period for B.cuneata is around four years. Populations are very vulnerable to fire during this period, as fire will wipe out the entire population <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be no seed from which it might recover. A model-based investigation found that the optimal fire interval for maximising population size over the medium term is around 15 years. More frequent fires reduce population size by killing adults before they have reached their full fecundity. Less frequent fires reduce population size because there are fewer opportunities for seed dispersal and germination. However, the optimal fire interval for minimising the risk of extinct in the long term is probably much longer.|$|E

25|$|According to Colwell, {{the quality}} and {{inclusiveness}} of a country's health care system affects the control of cholera, {{as it did in}} the Zimbabwean cholera outbreak. While sanitation practices are important, when governments respond quickly and have readily available vaccines, the country will have a lower cholera death toll. Affordability of vaccines can be a problem; if the governments do not provide vaccinations, only the wealthy may be able to afford them <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be a greater toll on the country's poor.
