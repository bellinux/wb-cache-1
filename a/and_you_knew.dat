25|$|Frankie Laine was {{somebody}} that everybody knew. He {{was a kind}} of a household word like Frank Sinatra or Bobby Darin or Peggy Lee or Ella Fitzgerald—Frankie Laine {{was one of the great}} popular singers and stylists of that time…And his style…he was one of those artists who had such a unique stamp—nobody sounded like he did. You could hear two notes <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> who it was and you were right on the beam with it right away. And of course that defines a successful popular artist, at least at that time. These people were all uniquely individual and Frank was on the front rank of those people in his appeal to the public and his success and certainly in his identifiability. — John Williams.|$|E
2500|$|When Bickle {{decides to}} assassinate Senator Palantine, he cuts his {{hair into a}} Mohawk. This detail was {{suggested}} by actor Victor Magnotta, a friend of Scorsese's who had a small role as a Secret Service agent and who had served in Vietnam. Scorsese later noted: [...] "Magnotta had talked about certain types of soldiers going into the jungle. They cut their hair in a certain way; looked like a Mohawk ... <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> that was a special situation, a commando kind of situation, and people gave them wide berths ... {{we thought it was}} a good idea." ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{studied the}} book and built Steve Davis's own {{technique}} {{on it in the}} 1970s. He started playing at the Lucania Snooker Club in Romford, where at the age of 18 the manager of the club brought his talent to the attention of Barry Hearn, chairman of the Lucania chain of snooker halls. Hearn became Davis' friend and manager. Paid £25 a match by Hearn, Davis toured the country, taking part in challenge matches against established professionals such as Ray Reardon, John Spencer and Alex Higgins. Around this time he was given the nickname [...] "Nugget" [...] because, according to Hearn, [...] "you could put your case of money on him <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> {{you were going to get}} paid." ...|$|E

5000|$|Like many children's cantations, {{there are}} many {{versions}} of the lyrics. A popular version goes like this:If you're happy <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it, clap your hands!If you're happy <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it, clap your hands!If you're happy <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> really want to show it;If you're happy <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it, clap your hands! ...|$|R

2500|$|At Abbey Road Studios on 20 May 1970, a {{month after}} the Beatles' break-up, Harrison ran through [...] "Hear Me Lord" [...] alone on {{electric}} guitar for producer Phil Spector. Leng suggests that, following Lennon and McCartney's routine dismissal of many of his compositions, Harrison [...] "presented his new songs with reticence, almost with a Pavlovian expectation of their being rejected". In his interview for the 2011 [...] documentary, Spector explains his positive reaction to Harrison's spiritually themed songs: [...] "He just lived by his deeds. He was spiritual <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> it, and there was no salesmanship involved. It made you spiritual being around him." [...] Harrison biographer Gary Tillery notes an additional need for faith on the singer's part in mid 1970 as [...] "pillars of Harrison's old life were passing away", with the demise of his former band and the fatal illness of his mother, Louise.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{responses}} {{to her voice}} emphasise her breathy sensuality. Another powerful feature was the sense of longing, in songs such as [...] "I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself" [...] and [...] "Goin' Back". The uniqueness of Springfield's voice was described by Bacharach: [...] "You could hear just three notes <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> it was Dusty". Wexler declared, [...] "er particular hallmark was a haunting sexual vulnerability in her voice, and she may have had the most impeccable intonation of any singer I ever heard". Greil Marcus of Rolling Stone captured Springfield's technique as [...] "a soft, sensual box (voice) that allowed her to combine syllables until they turned into pure cream." [...] She had a finely tuned musical ear and extraordinary control of tone. She sang {{in a variety of}} styles, mostly pop, soul, folk, Latin, and rock'n'roll. Being able to wrap her voice around difficult material, her repertoire included songs that their writers ordinarily would have offered to black vocalists. In the 1960s, on several occasions, she performed as the only white singer on all-black bills. Her soul orientation was so convincing that early in her solo career, US listeners who had only heard her music on radio or records sometimes assumed that she was African American. Later, a considerable number of critics observed that she sounded black and American or made a point of saying she did not.|$|E

'You {{have seen}} his letters come to me ever since his first visit, papa, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> they were a sort of--love-letters; and since he has been here you have let him be alone with me almost entirely; and you guessed, you must have guessed, what we were {{thinking}} of, and doing, and you didn't stop him.

5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of tawhid, {{in the words}} of the prominent Mu’tazili scholar Chief Justice Qadi Abd al-Jabbar (d. 415 AH/1025 AD), is: [...] the knowledge that God, being unique, has attributes that no creature shares with Him. This is explained by the fact that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that the world has a creator who created it and that: He existed eternally in the past and He cannot perish while we exist after being non-existent and we can perish. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that He was and is eternally all-powerful and that impotence is not possible for Him. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that He is omniscient of the past and present and that ignorance is not possible for Him. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that He knows everything that was, everything that is, and how things that are not would be if they were. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that He is eternally in the past and future living, and that calamities and pain are not possible for Him. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that He sees visible things, and perceives perceptibles, and that He does not have need of sense organs. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that He is eternally past and in future sufficient and it is not possible for Him to be in need. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that He is not like physical bodies, and that it is not possible for Him to get up or down, move about, change, be composite, have a form, limbs and body members. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that He is not like the accidents of motion, rest, color, food or smells. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that He is One throughout eternity and there is no second beside Him, and that everything other than He is contingent, made, dependent, structured, and governed by someone/thing else. Thus, if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> all of that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> the oneness of God.|$|R
