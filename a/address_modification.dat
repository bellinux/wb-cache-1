The minicomputer's main task was to build and modify the display list as needed for the next refresh cycle. For text and 2-D line graphics this was easy and did not involve much computing. To minimize costs, Imlac designed their own simple minicomputer with as few registers and logic gates as possible. It was a single-accumulator machine much like a DEC PDP-8, except using 16-bit instructions and data instead of 12 bits. There were no integer multiply/divide instructions, no floating point instructions, no microprogramming, no virtual addressing, and no cache. The single form of <b>address</b> <b>modification</b> was via indirect address pointers held in memory. Certain pointer cells would auto-increment when used. Stack operations were not supported.|$|E

One of the most common types of {{buffer overflow}} attacks is the hijacking of the program counter by overwriting function return addresses in the process ’ stack so as to redirect the program’s control flow to some malicious code injected into the process ’ memory. Previous solutions to this problem are based either on hardware or the compiler. The former requires special hardware while the latter requires the source code of the software. In this paper we introduce the use of a Transparent RUntime Shadow Stack (TRUSS) to protect against function return <b>address</b> <b>modification.</b> Our proposed scheme is built on top of DynamoRIO, a dynamic binary rewriting framework. DynamoRIO is implemented on both Windows and Linux. Hence, our scheme is able to protect applications on both operating systems. We have successfully tested our implementation on the SPECINT 2000 benchmark programs on both Windows and Linux, John Wilander’s “Dynamic testbed for twenty buffer overflow attacks” as well as Microsoft Access, Powerpoint and Word 2002. This paper will discuss the implementation details of our scheme as well as provide a performance evaluation. The latter shows that TRUSS is able to operate with an average overhead of about 20 % to 50 % which we believe is acceptable. ...|$|E
40|$|Regulation of {{the edge}} {{transport}} barrier (ETB) in H-mode has been examined on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak {{in a series of}} recent experiments intended to characterize the ETB, or edge pedestal, structure, as well as associated edge relaxation mechanisms. Extensive prior work [1, 2] determined a number of robust scaling laws for the pedestal in high-recycling plasmas with single null geometry and with the ion Bı drift directed towards the active x-point. Current experiments <b>address</b> <b>modification</b> {{of the edge}} pedestal and global confinement that can be obtained when tools such as neutral particle control and shaping variation are invoked. The main operational goal is to use these tools to reduce core particle inventory to explore high-performance operation at reduced density and/or collisionality p*. The H-modes under study, which are often maintained in steady state for periods much longer than the energy confinement time vE, generally do not exhibit large edge-localized modes (ELMs). Typical edge relaxation mechanisms are the quasi-coherent mode (QCM) associated with enhanced Dc (EDA) discharges [1] and, under the right operational conditions, small ELMs. Pedestal measurements presented here are from mm-resolution edge Thomson scattering; comparisons with charge exchange recombination spectroscopy measurements, when available, demonstrate near equality of Te and TI over a wide range of discharges.
