5|$|Very severe {{hypothyroidism}} and myxedema coma are characteristically {{associated with}} low sodium {{levels in the}} blood together with elevations in <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone,</b> as well as acute worsening of kidney function due {{to a number of}} causes.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located at}} the base of the brain, and intimately connected with the hypothalamus. It consists of two lobes: the posterior pituitary, which consists of nervous tissue branching out of the hypothalamus, and the anterior pituitary, which consists of hormone-producing epithelium. The posterior pituitary secretes <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone,</b> which regulates osmolarity of the blood, and oxytocin, which causes contractions of the uterus in childbirth and participates in breastfeeding.|$|E
5|$|<b>Antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ADH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} the syndrome of diabetes insipidus (unrelated to diabetes mellitus): inability to concentrate the urine, leading to polyuria (production of large amounts of clear urine) that is low in solutes, dehydration and—in compensation—extreme thirst and constant need to drink (polydipsia), as well as hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood). ADH deficiency may be masked if there is ACTH deficiency, with symptoms only appearing when cortisol has been replaced.|$|E
50|$|Functions of {{diuretic}} and <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormones</b> include: postprandial diuresis, post-eclosion diuresis, excretion {{of excess}} metabolic water, clearance of toxic wastes and restricting metabolite loss (Coast et al., 2002).|$|R
50|$|Electrolyte {{balance is}} {{maintained}} by oral, or in emergencies, intravenous (IV) intake of electrolyte-containing substances, and is regulated by hormones, in general with the kidneys flushing out excess levels. In humans, electrolyte homeostasis is regulated by <b>hormones</b> such as <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormones,</b> aldosterone and parathyroid hormones. Serious electrolyte disturbances, such as dehydration and overhydration, {{may lead to}} cardiac and neurological complications and, unless they are rapidly resolved, {{will result in a}} medical emergency.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} {{dilution}} of the interstitial fluids on the responsiveness of the toad urinary bladder to <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormones</b> has been examined in vivo and in vitro. Toads were given periodic injections with vasopressin while in water {{so that their}} plasma osmolality fell below 190 mosmoles/kg H 20. The hydraulic conductivity of bladders which {{had been removed from}} the animal and fixed with 1 % glutaraldehyde was 10 -fold less in overhydrated toads than in normally hydrated controls. A similar inhibitory phenomenon was observed in in vitro studies, when the tonicity of Ringer's fluid in which the bladders were suspended was lowered from its isotonic value. Mannitol, but not urea, could be effectively substituted for one-half of the NaC 1 content of Ringer's fluid. In other experiments {{it has been shown that}} the responsiveness of the bladder to vasotocin is depressed during bulk water movement across the tissue. This "flux inhibition " was found to depend upon the velocity and the duration of water flow from mucosa to the serosa. It is suggested that the responsiveness of the toad bladder to <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormones</b> diminishes as the effective osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluids declines...|$|R
5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone replacement therapy. The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone.</b> This may be treated with the drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the type}} of tumor, paraneoplastic phenomena—symptoms not due to the local {{presence}} of cancer—may initially attract attention to the disease. In lung cancer, these phenomena may include hypercalcemia, syndrome of inappropriate <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone</b> (SIADH, abnormally concentrated urine and diluted blood), ectopic ACTH production, or Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (muscle weakness due to autoantibodies). Tumors {{in the top of the}} lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to Horner's syndrome (dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil on that side), as well as damage to the brachial plexus.|$|E
5|$|Hyponatremia, {{an unusually}} {{low level of}} sodium in the blood that may cause {{confusion}} and seizures, is found in 40% of cases. This {{may be caused by}} low cortisol levels or by inappropriate release of <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ADH) from the posterior pituitary. Several other hormonal deficiencies may develop in the subacute phase. 50% have a deficiency in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), leading to undersecretion of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland and characteristic symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. 75% develop a deficiency to gonadotropins (LH and FSH), which control the reproductive hormone glands. This leads to a disrupted menstrual cycle, infertility and decreased libido.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} known for many years that insects possess {{diuretic}} and antidiuretic factors, but it has only been comparatively recently that technological advances have allowed for them to be characterised. Antidiuretic factors are less well studied than diuretic factors. They act either on the Malpighian tubules to inhibit urine production, or on the hindgut to stimulate reabsorption. To date, the only insect for which both diuretic and <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormones</b> (acting directly on tubules) have been isolated is a beetle, the mealworm Tenebrio molitor (Tenebrionidae).|$|R
40|$|Beetles, {{like other}} insects, depend on {{diuretic}} and <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormones</b> to control water balance. We have isolated, using head extracts from the beetle Tenebrio molitor, a peptide that strongly inhibits fluid secretion by the Malpighian tubules of this insect. This antidiuretic factor (ADF) appears to elicit its effect via cGMP {{as a second}} messenger but does not stimulate NO production. It has primary structure: Val-Val-Asn-Thr-Pro-Gly-His-Ala-Val-Ser-Tyr-His-Val-Tyr-OH. The ADF inhibits tubule secretion with high potency: the EC 50 is around 10 fM. It bears no significant resemblance to other biologically active neuropeptides. To our knowledge {{this is the only}} endogenous insect ADF acting on Malpighian tubules to be sequenced, and the first coleopteran (beetle) antidiuretic factor fully characterized to date...|$|R
40|$|A {{partially}} purified enzyme {{extracted from}} the bladder of the toad, Bufo marinus L., was found to cleave the glycine amide moiety from oxytocin, 8 -lysine-vasopressin, 8 -arginine-vasopressin, and other hormone analogs terminating in a primary carboxamide group; however, this enzyme does not attack hormone analogs terminating with a methylamide, dimethylamide, or carboxyl group. Preliminary experiments indicate that a functionally similar enzyme is also present in the mammalian kidney, the major target organ of neurohypophyseal <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormones.</b> This enzyme, besides inactivating oxytocin and 8 -lysine-vasopressin, also cleaves the phenylalanine amide moiety from a tetrapeptide analog of gastrin, another hormone terminating in a primary carboxamide group. Attention is drawn to the possible general significance of “carboxamidopeptidases” for the termination of the action of peptide hormones in which the C-terminal amino acid residue bears a carboxamide group...|$|R
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome depends on findings such as rapid development of muscle paralysis, absent reflexes, absence of fever, and a likely cause. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (through a lumbar spinal puncture) and nerve conduction studies are supportive investigations commonly {{performed in the}} {{diagnosis of}} GBS. Testing for antiganglioside antibodies is often performed, but their contribution to diagnosis is usually limited. Blood tests are generally performed to exclude the possibility of another cause for weakness, such as {{a low level of}} potassium in the blood. An abnormally low level of sodium in the blood is often encountered in Guillain–Barré syndrome. This has been attributed to the inappropriate secretion of <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone,</b> leading to relative retention of water.|$|E
5|$|Most {{pituitary}} hormones can {{be replaced}} indirectly by administering {{the products of the}} effector glands: hydrocortisone (cortisol) for adrenal insufficiency, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, testosterone for male hypogonadism, and estradiol for female hypogonadism (usually with a progestogen to inhibit unwanted effects on the uterus). Growth hormone is available in synthetic form, but needs to be administered parenterally (by injection). <b>Antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone</b> {{can be replaced}} by desmopressin (DDAVP) tablets or nose spray. Generally, the lowest dose of the replacement medication is used to restore wellbeing and correct the deranged results, as excessive doses would cause side-effects or complications. Those requiring hydrocortisone are usually instructed to increase their dose in physically stressful events such as injury, hospitalization and dental work as these are times when the normal supplementary dose may be inadequate, putting the patient at risk of adrenal crisis.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: We {{assessed}} {{the impact of}} transobturator tape (TOT) treatment on overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms with a particular focus on nocturia in patients with mixed urinary incontinence (MUI). Materials and Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, the medical records of 237 women who underwent TOT surgery {{for the treatment of}} MUI were reviewed. Of these, 86 patients (36. 4 %) had preoperative nocturia. Patients with neurological diseases or sleep disorders that could affect the voiding pattern were excluded. Patients who were being treated with anticholinergics and <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormones</b> were also excluded, which left 70 subjects eligible for analysis. Pre- and postoperative evaluations consisted of a physical examination, 3 -day frequency-volume chart, and health-related quality of life questionnaires (King’s health questionnaire, overactive bladder symptom score, and OAB-questionnaire). Results: TOT treatment resulted in an overall significant improvement in OAB symp-toms including nocturia. Frequency-volume charts revealed that TOT treatment sig-nificantly decreased the actual number of nightly voids (ANV) and the nocturnal blad...|$|R
30|$|Hyponatremia {{with normal}} ECFV {{overlaps}} extensively with the syndrome of inappropriate <b>antidiuretic</b> (AVP) <b>hormone</b> secretion. In order for this diagnosis to be contemplated {{the following criteria}} should be fulfilled: hypotonic hyponatremia, urine osmolality in excess of plasma osmolality, euvolemia, and normal renal and adrenal function [161]. However distinguishing euvolemic patients from mildly hypovolemic patients based solely on clinical grounds is notoriously challenging [145, 162, 163].|$|R
40|$|Neuroendocrine {{secretions}} {{from the}} terminal abdominal ganglion (TAG) augment the cephalic neuroendocrine regulation of integumentary water {{loss in the}} cockroach. As with the cephalic system, the TAG produces both promoting (TAGP) and restricting (TAGR) secretions which, respectively, {{lead to an increase}} or a decrease in the rate of integumentary water loss. The promoting factor (TAGP) requires priming by the cephalic promoting factor (BHP) before it is activated, and it probably acts by stimulating release of more BHP which in turn increases water loss through the integument. The restricting factor (TAGR) is autoactive and exerts its effects {{even in the absence of}} the cephalic neuroendo-crine system or its secretions. It provides additional, independent restriction of integumentary water loss in adverse (desiccating) ambient conditions. Its action accounts for the longer-term decrease in water loss found in decapitated cockroaches. These effects parallel closely the effects of the diuretic and <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormones</b> produced by the TAG. Measurement of faecal product demonstrates that the changes in overall water loss are not primarily due to changes in excretory loss but are due to regulation of integumentary permeability...|$|R
25|$|Alcohol {{has been}} known to {{mitigate}} the production of <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone,</b> which is a hormone that acts on the kidney to favour water reabsorption in the kidneys during filtration. This occurs because alcohol confuses osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which relay osmotic pressure information to the posterior pituitary, the site of <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone</b> release. Alcohol causes the osmoreceptors to signal that there is low osmotic pressure in the blood, which triggers an inhibition of the <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone.</b> As a consequence, one's kidneys are no longer able to reabsorb as much water as they should be absorbing, leading to creation of excessive volumes of urine and the subsequent overall dehydration.|$|E
25|$|Stimulation of the {{posterior}} pituitary to release vasopressin (<b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone,</b> ADH) also acts on the kidneys to increase water retention. If ADH production is excessive in heart failure, Na+ {{level in the}} plasma may fall (hyponatremia), {{and this is a}} sign of increased risk of death in heart failure patients.|$|E
25|$|Any sign of low blood sodium (hyponatremia) or {{weakness}} {{should be}} treated {{with the addition of}} hematin, heme arginate, or even tin mesoporphyrin, as these are signs of impending syndrome of inappropriate <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone</b> (SIADH) or peripheral nervous system involvement that may be localized or severe, progressing to bulbar paresis and respiratory paralysis.|$|E
40|$|Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) is {{characterized}} by repeated spells of apnea. Collapsibility of hypopharynx due to multiple factors involving pharyngeal dilator muscles and deposition of fat or fluid in the surrounding soft tissues are important contributing factors in its pathogenesis. OSA commonly affects obese individuals. Males are more commonly affected than the females {{probably due to the}} disturbing effect of testosterone on sleep. The impact of OSA on human health include disturbances in endocrine and metabolic system affecting hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, adrenocorticotrophic-cortisol axis, growth <b>hormone,</b> <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormones</b> and insulin resistance. There is a tendency for predisposition of the metabolic syndrome or its components including glycemic dysregulation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and physical parameters related to adiposity. On the other hand, several endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism, growth hormone excess, polycystic ovarian disease and testosterone replacement are associated with increased prevalence of OSA. There is limited information on the effect of treatment of OSA by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on the endocrine and metabolic disturbances. There is a need to conduct randomized controlled trials using CPAP therapy in patients with OSA and to study its cause and effect relationship with endocrine and metabolic disturbances...|$|R
40|$|Many Australian {{tetrapods}} inhabit desert environments characterised by low productivity, unpredictable rainfall, {{high temperatures}} and high incident solar radiation. Maintaining a homeostatic milieu intérieur by osmoregulation and thermoregulation are two physiological {{challenges faced by}} tetrapods in deserts, and the endocrine system {{plays an important role}} in regulating these processes. There is a considerable body of work examining the osmoregulatory role of <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormones</b> for Australian amphibians, reptiles and mammals, with particular contributions concerning their role and function for wild, free-living animals in arid environments. The osmoregulatory role of the natriuretic peptide system has received some attention, while the role of adrenal corticosteroids has been more thoroughly investigated for reptiles and marsupials. The endocrinology of thermoregulation has not received similar attention. Reptiles are best-studied, with research examining the influence of arginine vasotocin and melatonin on body temperature, the role of prostaglandins in heart rate hysteresis and the effect of melanocyte-stimulating hormone on skin reflectivity. Australian mammals have been under-utilised in studies examining the regulation, development and evolution of endothermy, and there is little information concerning the endocrinology of thermoregulation for desert species. There is a paucity of data concerning the endocrinology of osmoregulation and thermoregulation for Australian desert birds. Studies of Australian desert fauna have made substantial contributions to endocrinology, but there is considerable scope for further research. A co-ordinated approach to examine arid-habitat adaptations of the endocrine system in an environmental and evolutionary context would be of particular value...|$|R
40|$|Classic {{laboratory}} studies {{performed in the}} 1950 's and 1960 's focused on the structures and biochemical actions of multiple neurohypophysial peptides that possessed profound effects on the overall water balance of many vertebrates [reviewed in 1]. These data {{emphasized the importance of}} <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormones</b> (ADH) in the evolution of vertebrates and provided a framework for our current understanding of their roles in renal function. In a similar fashion, the recent discovery of the family of aquaporin water channel proteins has supplied new tools to examine the molecular aspects of ADH-elicited water transport in epithelial physiology. Data concerning the structure and distribution of aquaporin water channels have been further advanced by recent research defining several of the most basic aspects of hormonally regulated transport in many cell types. Together, these findings have provided many new insights into the apical membrane events set in motion by the binding of ADH to the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells. The purpose of this review is to highlight the role of the ADH-elicited water permeability response in the terrestrial adaptation of amphibians and their evolutionary offspring, mammals including humans. To accomplish this, we have divided the review into three sections. The first section summarizes published data from studies in comparative physiology involving the evolution and distribution of the ADH-elicited water permeability response in various amphibian species. The second section provides an overview of the vesicle mediated water permeability response in toad bladder and mammals. In this selective review, we have emphasized several common features present in ADH-mediated insertion and removal of water channel containing vesicles and the insulin-induced vesicular translocation of a facilitative glucose transport protein. The third section re-examines two important questions about the evolution of the ADH-elicited water permeability response in light of recent data reviewed in the prior section. Taken together, these data illustrate that future research in this area will provide new insights into the origins of the ADH-elicited water permeability response through use of probes specific for various aquaporin water channel proteins...|$|R
25|$|The kidney {{participates in}} whole-body homeostasis, {{regulating}} acid-base balance, electrolyte concentrations, extracellular fluid volume, and blood pressure. The kidney accomplishes these homeostatic functions both independently and {{in concert with}} other organs, particularly those of the endocrine system.

25|$|Baroreceptors in low {{pressure}} receptor zones (mainly in the venae cavae and the pulmonary veins, {{and in the}} atria) result in feedback by regulating the secretion of <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ADH/Vasopressin), renin and aldosterone. The resultant increase in blood volume results in an increased cardiac output by the Frank–Starling law of the heart, in turn increasing arterial blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Maintaining {{water and}} salt {{level of the}} body. Any {{significant}} rise in plasma osmolality is detected by the hypothalamus, which communicates directly with the posterior pituitary gland. An increase in osmolality causes the gland to secrete <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone</b> (ADH), resulting in water reabsorption by the kidney {{and an increase in}} urine concentration. The two factors work together to return the plasma osmolality to its normal levels.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe tumour promoter, {{phorbol ester}} 12, 13 -dibutyrate (PDBu), acts on rectal palisadic {{epithelial}} cells and mimics {{the effects of}} neuroparsin, an <b>antidiuretic</b> neuronal <b>hormone</b> isolated from nervous lobes of the African locust corpora cardiaca. PDBu stimulated Ca 2 +-dependent phospholipase C (PLC) activity resulting in inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3) production, increased cytosolic free calcium (monitored with the probe indo- 1) and rectal fluid resorption. A 15 -min pre-treatment with polymyxin B (PMXB), a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor acting at the phosphatidylserine (PS) binding site, suppressed PDBu stimulatory effects on free calcium entry and fluid resorption but not on phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PtdIns- 4, 5 -P 2) breakdown. On the contrary, bisindolylmaleimide Ro 32 - 0432 (which inhibits PKC at its ATP binding site) abolished entirely PDBu-stimulated PLC activity. It was concluded that two PKC are involved in transduction of the antidiuretic signal of neuroparsin. One PKC is PMXB sensitive and stimulates biological response after cytosolic free Ca 2 + increase, while another PKC, insensitive to the PKC inhibitor, regulates the processes induced by the former PKC. Since PMXB-insensitive PKC exerts a stimulatory effect on PtdIns- 4, 5 -P 2 -PLC production, this original mechanism may {{be considered as a}} new signalling pathway under control of PKC...|$|R
40|$|The kidney plays {{a central}} role in the {{regulation}} of the body water balance. The process of targeting the water channel aquaporin- 2 (AQP 2) on the apical plasma membrane of the collecting duct (CD) principal cells is mainly regulated by the <b>antidiuretic</b> peptide <b>hormone</b> arginine vasopressin (AVP), which is responsible for the maintenance of water homeostasis. Recently, much attention has been focused on the local factors modulating renal water reabsorption by AQP 2 in the collecting ducts, especially prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2). PGE 2 is a lipid mediator involved in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes in the kidney. The biological function of PGE 2 is mainly mediated by four G-protein-coupled receptors, namely EP 1 - 4, which couple to drive separate intracellular signaling pathways. Increasing evidence demonstrates that PGE 2 is essential for renal water transport regulation via multiple mechanisms. Each EP receptor plays a unique role in regulating water reabsorption in renal collecting ducts. This brief review highlights the role of PGE 2 in the regulation of water reabsorption and discusses the involvement of each EP receptor subtype in renal collecting duct. A better understanding of the role of PGE 2 in renal water transport process may improve disease management strategies for water balance disorders, including nephrogenic diabetes insipidus...|$|R
40|$|The hypothalamoneurohypophyseal system (HNS) {{consists}} of the large peptidergic magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic hypo thalamic nucleus (SON) and the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), the axons of which course through the internal zone of the median eminence and terminate at blood capillaries of the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. The HNS is a specialized brain neurosecretory apparatus responsible {{for the production of}} the <b>antidiuretic</b> peptide <b>hormone</b> vasopressin (VP). VP maintains water balance by promoting water conservation {{at the level of the}} kidney. Dehydration evokes a massive increase in the regulated release of VP from magnocellular neuron axon terminals in the posterior pituitary, which is accompanied by a plethora of changes in the morphology, electrophysiological properties, and biosynthetic and secretory activity of the HNS. We wish to understand this functional plasticity in terms of the differential expression of genes. We have therefore used microarrays to comprehensively catalog the genes expressed in the PVN, the SON and the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary gland of control and dehydrated rats. Comparison of these gene lists has enabled us to identify transcripts that are regulated as a consequence of dehydration as well as RNAs that are enriched in the PVN or the SON. We suggest that these differentially expressed genes represent candidate regulators and effectors of HNS activity and remodeling...|$|R
25|$|DDAVP (desmopressin) tablets are a {{synthetic}} replacement for <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone,</b> the hormone that reduces urine production during sleep.

25|$|Tolvaptan and conivaptan antagonize {{the effects}} of <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone</b> (vasopressin), thereby {{promoting}} the specific excretion of free water, directly ameliorating the volume overloaded state, and counteracting the hyponatremia that occurs due {{to the release of}} neuroendocrine hormones in an attempt to counteract {{the effects of}} heart failure. The EVEREST trial, which utilized tolvaptan, showed that when used in combination with conventional therapy, many symptoms of acute decompensated heart failure were significantly improved compared to conventional therapy alone although they found no difference in mortality and morbidity when compared to conventional therapy.|$|E
25|$|The first {{ability is}} a hormone cycle {{that reduces the}} body's urine production. At about sunset each day, the body {{releases}} a minute burst of <b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone</b> (also known as arginine vasopressin or AVP). This hormone burst reduces the kidney's urine output well into the night so that the bladder does not get full until morning. This hormone cycle is not present at birth.

40|$|Growth hormone (GH) is a {{naturally}} occurring polypeptide hormone produced by somatotropic {{cells in the}} anterior pituitary. The main function of somatotropin is stimulation of linear growth, but it also affects carbohydrate metabolism, increases bone mass and has potent lipolytic, antinatriuretic and <b>antidiuretic</b> effects. Growth <b>hormone</b> deficiency (GHD) may occur both in children and in adults. At the moment there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of GHD, and the diagnosis should take into account clinical, auxological, biochemical and radiological changes and, if necessary, genetic testing. Recent studies have highlighted that the biochemical diagnosis of GH deficiency is still imperfect. Stimuli used in the tests are non-physiological, and various substances are characterized by a different mechanism of action and potency. A few {{years ago it was}} thought that GHD treatment in children must be completed at the end of linear growth. Studies performed {{in the last two decades}} have shown that GHD deficiency in adults may result in complex clinical problems, and if untreated shortens the life expectancy and worsens its comfort. Discontinuation of GH therapy after the final height has been reached in fact negatively impacts the physiological processes associated with the transition phase, which is the period of human life between achieving the final height and 25 - 30 years of age. Given the adverse metabolic effects of GH treatment interruption after linear growth has been completed, the latest recommendations propose reassessment of GH secretion in the period at least one month after cessation of treatment and continuation of the therapy in case of persistent deficit...|$|R
40|$|Mammals {{have evolved}} {{sophisticated}} behavioral and physiological responses to oppose {{changes in the}} osmolality of their extracellular fluid. The behavioral approach consists of regulating the intake of salt and water through changes in sodium appetite and thirst. The physiological approach comprises adjustments of renal excretion of water and sodium which are achieved through changes in the release of <b>antidiuretic</b> and natriuretic <b>hormones.</b> Individually, these osmoregulatory responses are controlled by "osmoreceptors": groups of specialized nerve cells capable of transducing changes in external osmotic pressure into meaningful electrical signals. Some of these sensors {{are located in the}} region of the hepatic portal vein, a strategic site allowing early detection of the osmotic impact of ingested foods and fluids. Changes in systemic osmolality, however, are detected centrally, within regions that include the medial preoptic area, the median preoptic nucleus, the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT), the subfornical organ, and the supraoptic nucleus (SON). While studies have indicated that these central and peripheral osmoreceptors participate in the control of osmoregulatory responses, little is known of the mechanisms by which this is achieved. One notable exception, however, consists of the osmotic control of electrical activity in SON neurons which, in the rat, contributes to the regulation of natriuresis and diuresis through effects on the secretion of oxytocin and vasopressin. Previous studies have shown that these cells are respectively excited and inhibited by hypertonic and hypotonic conditions. Experiments in vitro indicate that these responses result from both the endogenous osmosensitivity of these cells and changes in synaptic drive. Patch-clamp analysis has revealed that SON neurons are respectively depolarized and hyperpolarized by increases and decreases in external osmolality and that these intrinsic responses result from changes in the activity of mechanosensitive cationic channels. Moreover, intracellular recordings in hypothalamic explants have shown that changes in electrical activity are associated with proportional changes in the frequency of glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials derived from osmosensitive OVLT neurons. Both of these mechanisms, therefore, may participate in the osmotic regulation of neurohypophysial hormone release in situ...|$|R
25|$|There {{are four}} types of DI, each with a {{different}} set of causes. Central DI (CDI) is {{due to a lack of}} the hormone vasopressin (<b>antidiuretic</b> <b>hormone).</b> This can be due to damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland or genetics. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) occurs when the kidneys do not respond properly to vasopressin. Dipsogenic DI is due to abnormal thirst mechanisms in the hypothalamus while gestational DI occurs only during pregnancy. Diagnosis is often based on urine tests, blood tests, and the fluid deprivation test. Diabetes mellitus is a separate condition with an unrelated mechanism, though both can result in the production of large amounts of urine.|$|E
