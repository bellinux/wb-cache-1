Normalized trace element patterns and diagnostic elemental ratio are very similar to those of modern Ocean-Island Basalts (OIB) a feature which suggests that the mantle source region was the asthenosphere. Comparison with the different types of OIB indicates that the basalts may be derived from a high U/Pb (HIMU) source with slightly elevated K and Ba contents.

Petrological chemical analysis results suggest that silica is poor and aluminum is rich, and high potassium large ion lithophile elements (LILE), light rare earth element (LREE) and Sr are obviously detracted in these rocks. High field strength elements (HFSE) and {{heavy rare earth element}} (HREE) are depleted, especially Nb, Ta, P and Ti. δ Eu: 0. 09 – 1. 64 shows that plagioclase does not appear fractional crystallization during the formation of alkali-rich rocks. δ 34 S, H and O isotopes and Pb isotopes suggest that ore-forming fluid is derived from the mantle, and Pb is possibly mixed by mantle, wall rock and crust. The age of Pb in alkali-rich rocks is about 250 – 220 Ma. The age of alkali porphyry rock (dykes) varies from 30 Ma to 50 Ma. <b>Alkali</b> <b>rocks</b> have strong metallogenetic relation.

Eleven rock samples of the pyroclastics were studied and interpreted {{on the basis of}} their petrography and whole-rock geochemistry in order to generate reliable interpretative model for their genetic and geodynamic history. Petrographic characterization shows that the rocks are composed of plagioclase (labradiorite and andesine), clinopyroxene (cpx) (augite), orthopyroxene (opx) (hypersthene), iron ores, olivine, nepheline and k-spar (in three samples), and quartz (in five samples). Major element geochemistry indicates that the pyroclastics are deficient in CaO and MgO, high in Na 2 O, TiO 2, and LOI, and low to high in K 2 O and are mainly <b>alkali</b> <b>rocks</b> with some olivine tholeiites, and a wide range of SiO 2 contents (38. 51 - 51. 69 %; av. 45. 07 %). The pyroclastics are opx- and cpx-normative with high normative plagioclase (44 - 66 %; av. 53 %). Trace element compositions indicate low contents of LILE, Zr, Ni, and Cr and high contents of HFSE, while the range of REE abundances and distinctive chondrite-normalized patterns define LREE enrichment and HREE depletion. The pyroclastics probably underwent fractional crystallization of olivine and cpx from a partial melt generated from the mantle due to hotspot activities underneath constructive plate margin. The magma was eventually modified by high-K alkaline chemistry, probably from the widening of the proto oceanic South Atlantic before a final emplacement as volcanics in a sediment-dominated continental rift setting...|$|E

It consist of layered ultramafic cumulates, layered gabbro, isotropic gabbro, diabase and a volcanic sequence that exhibits a wide range in composition from subalkaline basalts to alkaline basalts. The associated limestones including of Globotruncana fossils show an upper Cretaceous age for that. The geochemical data clearly identifies some of the volcanic rocks to have formed from two distinct types of basaltic melts: (i) those of the subalkaline suite which formed from an initial melt that are characterized by selective enrichments in fluid-soluble Large Ion Lithophile Elements (LILE) and LREE relative to the High Field Strength Elements (HFSE) and incompatible trace element patterns that suggest an island arc affinity and (ii) those of the alkaline suite with significant enrichment in LILE, HFSE and LMREE and a slight depletion in HREE and incompatible trace element patterns that are virtually identical to typical Oceanic Island Basalt (OIB) pattern. It is suggested that more than one-stage melting process is required to explain geochemical characteristics of back-arc basin and OIB basalts of this area.

40|$|The {{relationship}} among kimberlites, carbonate-rich bodies associated with them, and the carbonatites associated with <b>alkalis</b> <b>rock</b> complexes are reviewed. Particular {{attention is paid}} to the parageneses of oxide minerals in six carbonate-kimberlites: Peuyuk, Tunraq, Wesselton, Liqhobong, De Beers, and Benfontein. New analyses of spinel, limonite, and perovskite from the lower Benfontein Sill, are consistent with previous reports and can be divided into (1) early macrocrysts and cores of grains, and (2) late rims and groundmass grains. The evolution of a carbonate-rich residuum with progressive crystallization appears to be typical of carbonate-rich kimberlite magmas, and is texturally related to the two stages of oxide precipitation in these carbonate-kimberlites. Thus, early Mg-ilmenite and Cr-rich spinel are separated by reaction textures and carbonate from later Mg-Al-titanomagnetite, perovskite, and accessory utile and apatite. The spinels span a large range in composition from Mg-Al-chromite to Mg-Al-titanomagnetite, with an intermediate gap. This simplified paragenetic scheme, and in particular the spinel trend, is repeated in the five other carbonate-kimberlites reviewed. It may be representative of the hypabyssal kimberlites in general, and others where fluidization processes did not completely disrupt the crystallization sequence...|$|R

40|$|The Monaro Volcanic Province (MVP) is an Oligocene-Eocene intraplate basaltic lava field {{situated}} in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales between the towns of Cooma and Bombala. The lava pile of the MVP consists of basal sub-alkali rocks (olivine tholeiite, transitional basalt) capped {{by a number of}} thick ankaramite lavas, above which lie less numerous <b>alkali</b> <b>rocks</b> including alkali olivine basalt, nepheline basanite and olivine nephelinite. Intercalated with the lava flows are massive and matrix-supported alkali and ankaramitic hyaloclastites, alkali pillow basalts, rare tuffs, bauxitic weathering profiles, lacustrine sediments and reworked late Cretaceous to early Tertiary river gravels. The lava pile is intruded through by numerous volcanic plugs and dykes and rare maars. Volcanic centres are principally concentrated in two NW-SE trending zones parallel to major crustal-scale fractures in the Palaeozoic basement. Centres almost always lie over the intersections of two or more conjugate strike-slip or transverse fractures. The stratigraphy, whole-rock geochemistry and Sr and Nd isotopic signatures of rocks from the MVP indicate magma-genesis initially from an asthenospheric source with EM 1 characteristics, gradually becoming more lithospheric with DM source characteristics. The long-lived nature of the MVP rules out a mantle plume-type source for magmas. Instead, a diapiric source is envisaged. The MVP mantle xenolith suite appears to have equilibrated at slightly higher temperatures for given pressures than the Newer Volcanics Province suite suggesting the palaeogeotherm for the MVP was slightly hotter than the "South East Australian" geotherm. Large amounts of amphibole (pargasitic hornblende, pargasite, ferroan pargasite and kaersutite) occuring within the more silica-undersaturated rocks of the MVP, and rarely within Iherzolitic xenoliths, are interpreted to have formed as selvages on mantle veins in contact with peridotite beneath the MVP. Amphiboles were later sampled by magmas rising through the same conduits and were brought to the surface. MVP ankaramite lavas feature < 2 cm clinopyroxene porphyrocrysts, the cores of which are shown to have crystallised at ca. 18 kb pressure or ca. 54 km depth. This defines the base of the local crust within the MVP region. Data from the MVP support a landscape evolution model based on the isostatic rise of the Southern Highlands due to voluminous magmatic underplating since the Cretaceous. Data further support limited denudation since the Early Tertiary based on a pulsatory but high palaeogeotherm...|$|E

A total of 23 tephra layers and six ash zones were analyzed for major and trace element chemistry and grain size characteristics. Relative ages of the tephra layers were estimated based on paleomag-netic and oxygen isotope stratigraphy. Thicknesses of the ash layers range from less than 1 to 18 cm. It is inferred {{on the basis of their}} sorting coefficient and grain size that the majority of the tephra layers are the result of ash fallout from large explosive eruptions. Most of the tephra layers are crystal-poor, with less than 10 % total crystal content. Colorless shards dominate over sideromelane (brown glass) and tachylite. Platy bubble wall shards represent the dominant morphological type of glass, with minor amounts of pumice and vesicular shards. The major element composition of glasses indicates four compositional groups: basalt, basaltic andesite, trachyte and rhyo-lite.

The join, referred to as Terrane Boundary Shear Zone, exhibits an arcuate geometry at the NW margin of the Eastern Ghats where the mobile belt shows the presence of northwesterly verging nappes. Based on this, the area has been described to represent the salient part of a fold thrust belt. Juxtaposition of the granulites over the low grade craton is largely attributed to thrusting along the terrane boundary shear zone.

Trace elements were determined on 42 selected rocks. The contents of REE, Ba, U, Th and Hf increase with silica. The rocks of the marginal sea side are particularly enriched in these elements. The abundance of Sc, Cr, V and Co decreases with increasing silica content. It is noted that Sc and V behave as iron. The three groups, T & CT, H & CH and A & CA, are well distinguished from each other in the chondrite-normalized REE pattern, i. e. T & CT has distribution patterns vary similar to the ocean ridge tholeiite, showing a tendency toward depletion or equality of light REE over heavy REE, whereas A & CA has a marked enrichment of light REE over heavy REE. There is no essential difference in the REE pattern between the calc-alkali rocks and the associated basaltic rocks in each group, suggesting a common source for them. A negative Eu anomaly is a characteristic feature of the calc-alkali rocks, though this anomaly does not always appear. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios were determined on 49 samples. The ratios of the rocks of the Kurile are extremely low (0. 7028 ― 0. 7039), and those of the north Honshu arc are also low (0. 7026 ― 0. 7057). The Sr-isotope ratios of basalt to dacite in a single volcano are almost identical and exhibit a small range of variation without systematic change. This implies that the igneous magmas have been produced from a relatively homogeneous mantle material and not modified by contamination with the older continental crust...|$|R
