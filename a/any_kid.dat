[...] Gilchrist also praised how the film revived interest in animation as it was released {{at a time when}} interest in animation was at a lull. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote a mixed review of the film, referring to it as a [...] "likably unspectacular adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen classic." [...] Hinson went on to write that the film is average even at its highest points. He wrote that while {{there is nothing wrong with}} the film, it would be difficult for children to identify with Ariel and that the characters seemed bland. Hinson concluded his review saying that the film is [...] "accomplished but uninspiring, The Little Mermaid has enough to please <b>any</b> <b>kid.</b> All that's missing is the magic." [...] Empire gave {{a positive}} review of the film, stating that [...] " [...] a charmer of a movie, boasting all the ingredients that make a Disney experience something to treasure yet free of all the politically correct, formulaic elements that have bogged down the more recent productions." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an unconstitutional}} though {{widespread}} practice during the Communist witchhunts, the U.S. State Department refused to renew Rossen's passport. This, and {{his inability to}} find work, brought Rossen, like his friend, ex-Communist Elia Kazan, back to the committee in May 1953, where he named 57 people as Communists. [...] He explained to the committee why he chose to testify: [...] "I don't think, {{after two years of}} thinking, that any one individual can indulge himself in the luxury of personal morality or pit it against what I feel today very strongly is the security and safety of this nation." [...] Stephen Rossen later shed light on his father's decision: [...] "It killed him not to work. He was torn between his desire to work and his desire not to talk, and he didn't know what to do. What I think he wanted to know was, what would I think of him if he talked? He didn't say it in that way, though. Then he explained to me the politics of it—how the studios were in on it, and there was never any chance of his working. He was under pressure, he was sick, his diabetes was bad, and he was drinking. By this time I understood that he had refused to talk before and had done his time, from my point of view. What could <b>any</b> <b>kid</b> say at that point? You say, 'I love you and I'm behind you.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone {{gave the}} song {{four out of}} five stars, and called it [...] "predictably fizzy" [...] and [...] "fiendishly catchy". Rosen also said that the [...] "lyric, belted out with bright-sided earnestness by Lea Michele and Cory Monteith, distills the show's theme: the mystical power of a good tune and a well-choreographed jazz hands routine to turn geeks into gods". Robert Copsey of Digital Spy wrote, [...] "Max Martin and Shellback chuck the Pinks, Keshas and Katy Perrys into the kitchen sink and add a generous coat of gloss and shimmer (and Auto-Tune) to create what is {{ultimately}} an audacious, unabashed and, crucially, authentic pop stomper that remains true to what Glee is all about". Melinda Newman of HitFix liked the song, but said that it could have had [...] "more of an edge". Newman also said, [...] "For <b>any</b> <b>kid</b> who’s ever been bullied or adult who remembers being bullied, it's a bulls-eye." [...] Newman wrote that Michele, who opens the song, had a [...] "classic voice" [...] but it had no [...] "grit" [...] to it, and recommended that Pink cover it. Becky Bain of Idolator said that the song could have been a track for Pink or Avril Lavigne, two common artists who work with Martin. Bain said the song fit in with [...] "Raise Your Glass", and better yet, Kesha's [...] "We R Who We R". Christopher Rosen of Movieline said the song had [...] "total home run potential", and that it [...] "sounds like a blend of Pink, Katy Perry, Avril Lavigne, early Mandy Moore, and Kidz Bop. And that’s a good thing!" [...] On the point that the song sounds like a cover itself, Rosen asked, [...] "who wants to listen to an original song on a television show that relies on covers unless it sounds like a cover itself?" ...|$|E

500|$|The creators {{wanted to}} make Kim as {{believable}} as possible. Schooley's and McCorkle's own daughters inspired them to conceive Kim as a [...] "character with dimension ... that girls could watch and appreciate." [...] McCorkle was quick in deciding very early on that Kim {{does not belong to}} a spy organization, nor does she possess any superpowers. Although admitting that the character's accomplishments are generally [...] "implausible," [...] Schooley and McCorkle wanted Kim to remain relatable to young viewers, and avoided making her [...] "impervious" [...] like superheroes by giving her [...] "real problems and teen issues." [...] McCorkle described Kim as [...] "incredibly competent in the action world but challenged in the real world by all the things we all have trouble with", including embarrassment, school work and family. Schooley explained that [...] "What makes Kim effective in the action world is gymnastics, cheerleading, physical activity, something that <b>any</b> <b>kid,</b> any girl, in the world could do." [...] Additionally, the character is skilled in 17 different types of kung fu. At one point an indestructible supersuit complete with special abilities was created for Kim, but the outfit was ultimately abandoned to avoid contradicting with the character's [...] "she can do anything" [...] motto. Elaborating on her role in the pilot, Schooley believes that [...] "Kim's mix of tenacity, intelligence and heart makes for a very strong female role model for kids," [...] however, [...] "Sure she can save the world, but that doesn't help her a bit when she comes face-to-face with her latest school crush." [...] Furthermore, the writers envisioned the character having her own website and hand-held communicator – named the [...] "Kimmunicator" [...] after the character – with video chat, both of which were considered revolutionary back in 2000, a time when few young people owned cellphones. Kim's use of advanced technology represents her ability to [...] "effortlessly hop around the world and get back in time for dinner. Which is pretty unrealistic, but it’s what kids can do on the internet now. They can talk to somebody anywhere".|$|E
2500|$|Dell Antonia at Common Sense Media {{gave the}} show 4 out of 5 saying [...] "the {{dialogue}} is simple, the animation is intentionally scribbly and dark, {{and the color}} palette is limited.

And yet it's funny -- funny {{for the kind of}} parents who think Dexter's Laboratory is funny, and funny for <b>any</b> <b>kid</b> old enough to handle the weirdness of rooting for a patently bad girl who will never win and with nothing but a secret, lingering fear of monsters under the bed." ...|$|E

40|$|Using his {{seemingly}} crass {{and apparently}} pessimistic "This Be the Verse" {{as a point}} of departure, this paper examines Philip Larkin's poetry with regard to the poet's own attitude towards the reader. His highly accessible poems, penned in common language, resulted in a reputation as both a 'poet of the people' and a 'philistine'. But for all its crudeness, Larkin's mode of writing always showed a keen awareness of the distancing aspects of modernism. In other words, he was not ignorant of the current political trends of his time, rather he was consciously writing against what he deemed elitist art. In conclusion, the paper returns to "This Be the Verse" and considers the moral import of Larkin's ironically acerbic "Get out early as you can, and don't have <b>any</b> <b>kids</b> yourself˝...|$|R

5000|$|We {{were aware}} that it's a little risky. There's {{definitely}} some stuff in that {{first part of the}} movie that's going to be controversial. Here's where we came down on that specific issue: It was really important to us to show that both of the characters make some pretty big mistakes. I mean, his [...] "parental skills" [...] aren't that great. Maybe never having had <b>any</b> <b>kids</b> of his own, he doesn't realize that if you tell a kid to not do something, they're going to want to do it even more. And then she makes some mistakes and then he kind of overreacts to her mistakes and then she overreacts to his overreaction. So it's very human; it's a very understandable story. It's tricky because it's messy, because relationships are sometimes messy. But to me and to Alan and Brian, it was all very fascinating to us to explore that angle.|$|R
