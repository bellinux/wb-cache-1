25|$|When {{physically}} sorting objects, such as <b>alphabetizing</b> papers (such as {{tests or}} books), people intuitively generally use insertion sorts for small sets. For larger sets, people often first bucket, such as by initial letter, and multiple bucketing allows practical sorting of very large sets. Often space is relatively cheap, such as by spreading objects {{out on the}} floor or over a large area, but operations are expensive, particularly moving an object a large distance – locality of reference is important. Merge sorts are also practical for physical objects, particularly as two hands can be used, one for each list to merge, while other algorithms, such as heap sort or quick sort, are poorly suited for human use. Other algorithms, such as library sort, a variant of insertion sort that leaves spaces, are also practical for physical use.|$|E
500|$|Back in Los Angeles, Beck {{began to}} work at a video store in Silver Lake [...] "doing things like <b>alphabetizing</b> the {{pornography}} section". He began performing in arthouse clubs and coffeehouses such as Al's Bar and Raji's. In order to keep indifferent audiences engaged in his music, Beck would play in a spontaneous, joking manner. [...] "I'd be banging away on a Son House tune and the whole audience would be talking. So maybe out of desperation or boredom, or the audience's boredom, I'd make up these ridiculous songs just to see if people were listening," [...] he later remarked. Virtually an unknown to the public and an enigma to those who met him, Beck would hop onstage between acts in local clubs and play [...] "strange folk songs", accompanied by [...] "what could best be described as performance art" [...] while sometimes wearing a Star Wars stormtrooper mask. Beck met someone who offered to help record demos in his living room, and he began to pass cassette tapes around.|$|E

50|$|Thematic units {{can also}} {{fall short of}} {{teaching}} in-depth content to students. Often a theme, such as apples, is used to link unrelated subjects, with little deference to students’ prior knowledge or interests. This superficial coverage of a topic can give students the wrong idea about school, perhaps missing the idea of curriculum integration {{in the first place}} (Barton & Smith, 2000). Thematic units can contain pointless busywork and activities created solely to create a link to a theme; for example, the <b>alphabetizing</b> of state capitals in a social studies unit, attempting to integrate it with language arts (Brophy & Alleman, 1991).|$|E

5000|$|The primary {{difference}} between full members and alternate members is that full members have voting rights.

Alternate members follow a different protocol sequence: they are arranged by the number of votes received when they were elected at the previous Party Congress.|$|E

Allison soon starts forgetting her own origins while the teacher provides an extremely difficult assignment of writing down numbers from zero to one million and then <b>alphabetizing</b> them.

Peter Unseth notes one usage of [...] "digraphia" [...] that most closely parallels Ferguson’s “diglossia,” situations where a language uses different scripts for different domains; for instance, [...] "shorthand in English, pinyin in Chinese for <b>alphabetizing</b> library files, etc. or several scripts which are replaced by Roman script during e-mail usage." ...|$|E

When he becomes incapacitated due to a fall involving his disturbed dog and one of his crazy home inventions, he returns to the family home to stay with his eccentric siblings—sister Rose and brothers Porter and Charles. The siblings' odd habits include <b>alphabetizing</b> the groceries in the kitchen cabinets and ignoring the ringing telephone. When his publisher, Julian, comes to visit, Julian finds himself attracted to Rose. They eventually marry, though Rose later somehow leaves him to move back in with her brothers.|$|E
