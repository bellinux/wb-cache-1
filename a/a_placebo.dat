5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{include both}} an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding. Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal bleeding. In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (<b>a</b> <b>placebo</b> week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.|$|E

5|$|The {{circumcision}} procedure causes pain, and for neonates {{this pain}} {{may interfere with}} mother-infant interaction or cause other behavioral changes, so the use of analgesia is advocated. Ordinary procedural pain may be managed in pharmacological and non-pharmacological ways. Pharmacological methods, such as localized or regional pain-blocking injections and topical analgesic creams, are safe and effective. The ring block and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) are the most effective at reducing pain, and the ring block {{may be more effective}} than the DPNB. They are more effective than EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream, which is more effective than <b>a</b> <b>placebo.</b> Topical creams have been found to irritate the skin of low birth weight infants, so penile nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of people with aphthous stomatitis have minor symptoms and do not require any specific therapy. The pain is often tolerable with simple dietary modification during an episode of ulceration such as avoiding spicy and acidic foods and beverages.

Some of the results of interventions for RAS may in truth represent <b>a</b> <b>placebo</b> effect. No therapy is curative, with treatment aiming to relieve pain, promote healing and reduce the frequency of episodes of ulceration.|$|E

He is soon ostracized by family and friends and gets fired from his job, believed by family, friends and coworkers to have had homosexual relations, and is eventually evicted from his home. At the hospital, he is tended to by Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), who tells him that they are testing a drug called zidovudine (AZT), an antiretroviral drug which is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients—and is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing on humans.

40|$|Abstract Background Modern clinical-research {{practice}} favors placebo controls over usual-care controls whenever <b>a</b> credible <b>placebo</b> exists. An unrecognized {{consequence of}} this preference is that clinicians are more limited {{in their ability to}} provide the benefits of the non-specific healing effects of placebos in clinical practice. Methods We examined the issues in choosing between placebo and usual-care controls. We considered why placebo controls place constraints on clinicians and the trade-offs involved in the choice of control groups. Results We find that, for certain studies, investigators should consider usual-care controls, even if <b>an</b> adequate <b>placebo</b> is available. Employing usual-care controls would be of greatest value for pragmatic trials evaluating treatments to improve clinical care and for which threats to internal validity can be adequately managed without a placebo-control condition. Conclusions Intentionally choosing usual-care controls, even when <b>a</b> satisfactory <b>placebo</b> exists, would allow clinicians to capture the value of non-specific therapeutic benefits that are common to all interventions. The result could be more effective, patient-centered care that makes the best use of both specific and non-specific benefits of medical interventions. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background Alcoholic {{hepatitis}} is {{a clinical}} syndrome characterized by jaundice and liver impairment {{that occurs in}} patients {{with a history of}} heavy and prolonged alcohol use. The short-term mortality among patients with severe disease exceeds 30 %. Prednisolone and pentoxifylline are both recommended for the treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis, but uncertainty about their benefit persists. Methods We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial with a 2 -by- 2 factorial design to evaluate the effect of treatment with prednisolone or pentoxifylline. The primary end point was mortality at 28 days. Secondary end points included death or liver transplantation at 90 days and at 1 year. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis and severe disease were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four groups: a group that received <b>a</b> pentoxifylline-matched <b>placebo</b> and <b>a</b> prednisolone-matched <b>placebo,</b> <b>a</b> group that received prednisolone and <b>a</b> pentoxifylline-matched <b>placebo,</b> <b>a</b> group that received pentoxifylline and <b>a</b> prednisolone-matched <b>placebo,</b> or <b>a</b> group that received both prednisolone and pentoxifylline. Results A total of 1103 patients underwent randomization, and data from 1053 were available for the primary end-point analysis. Mortality at 28 days was 17 % (45 of 269 patients) in the placebo–placebo group, 14 % (38 of 266 patients) in the prednisolone–placebo group, 19 % (50 of 258 patients) in the pentoxifylline–placebo group, and 13 % (35 of 260 patients) in the prednisolone–pentoxifylline group. The odds ratio for 28 -day mortality with pentoxifylline was 1. 07 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 77 to 1. 49; P= 0. 69), and that with prednisolone was 0. 72 (95 % CI, 0. 52 to 1. 01; P= 0. 06). At 90 days and at 1 year, there were no significant between-group differences. Serious infections occurred in 13 % of the patients treated with prednisolone versus 7 % of those who did not receive prednisolone (P= 0. 002). Conclusions Pentoxifylline did not improve survival in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Prednisolone was associated with a reduction in 28 -day mortality that did not reach significance and with no improvement in outcomes at 90 days or 1 year.

30|$|Authors {{of future}} studies should {{consider}} the possibility of erroneous intervention effects that can result from the combination of using self-report measures of depressive symptoms {{and a lack of}} <b>a</b> believable <b>placebo</b> or active control condition. If adolescents are aware they participated in a depression prevention program, it is possible that they might answer questions regarding depressive symptoms post intervention in a socially desirable way, meaning they report fewer depressive symptoms than they actually experience. As only the participants in the prevention condition are likely to experience pressure to respond in this way, it is possible that erroneous intervention effects are observed. To avoid this problem, parent-, teacher-, or clinician-report measures of depressive symptoms should be collected in addition to self-reports. Further, as adolescents in <b>a</b> believable <b>placebo</b> or active control condition would experience a similar pressure to answer in a social desirable way, the authors of future studies might want to follow the example of Pössel et al. (2013) and to compare a prevention program with <b>an</b> equally believable <b>placebo</b> or active control program.|$|R

25|$|Another {{important}} medical {{application of}} a simulator—although, perhaps, denoting a slightly different meaning of simulator—is the use of <b>a</b> <b>placebo</b> drug, a formulation that simulates the active drug in trials of drug efficacy (see Placebo (origins of technical term)).|$|E
