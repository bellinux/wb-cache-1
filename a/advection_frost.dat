50|$|Types {{of frost}} include {{crystalline}} hoar frost from deposition of water vapor from air of low humidity, white frost in humid conditions, window frost on glass surfaces, <b>advection</b> <b>frost</b> from cold wind over cold surfaces, black frost without visible ice at low temperatures and very low humidity, and rime under supercooled wet conditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Advection</b> <b>frost</b> (also called wind frost) {{refers to}} tiny ice spikes that form {{when there is}} a very cold wind blowing over {{branches}} of trees, poles and other surfaces. It looks like rimming on the edge of flowers and leaves and usually it forms against the direction of the wind. It can occur at any hour, day or night.|$|E
50|$|The {{three main}} types of ground frost are {{radiation}} frost (hoar frost), <b>advection</b> <b>frost</b> (advection hoar frost) and evaporation frost. The latter {{is a rare}} type which occurs when surface moisture evaporates into drier air causing its temperature at the surface to fall at or under the freezing point of water. Rime (both soft and hard) is technically not a type of ground frost.|$|E
40|$|Radiation and <b>advection</b> <b>frost</b> {{are common}} in Jordan {{as well as other}} {{neighboring}} countries as they face several frost waves each year during the late months of winter. Recently, many frost episodes hit the valley and damaged the crops that were compensated by millions of dollars by the Jordanian Government. This manuscript addresses and characterizes frost, and assesses the role of global warming in impacting frost in terms of its frequency, severity, and total number of frost days per year. A comprehensive statistical approach was used. The paper indicates that frost waves will continue to hit in the near future regardless of the fact that Earth is moving towards warmer conditions. Agricultural and financial authorities should be urged to minimize frost damage by considering installing wind fans in Jordan valley as an active method in addition to implementing good farm practices (as a passive methods where deemed necessary) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSpring {{frost damage}} in Champagne {{vineyard}} (NE France) {{is a major}} issue among growers. When this natural hazard {{is due to a}} cold air mass <b>advection,</b> <b>frost</b> protection methods are generally inefficient because low temperatures occur over the entire region. In contrast, {{this is not the case}} when freezing occurs in radiative conditions (clear sky and calm wind), when marked temperatures differentiation can be observed due to a complex interplay between wind, topography, land cover, etc. To better understand the spatial and temporal distribution of nocturnal minimum temperatures during radiative conditions, we applied the numerical model MesoNH and confronted its results to observed data (network of weather stations). In this paper, a particular night in March 2003 is examined, a period during which frost was particularly intense. We find that the model reproduces quite well the direction of wind flow, but it tends to overestimate the minimum temperatures for the coldest sites. Moreover, it gives a clear illustration of the interaction between calm regional wind and local breeze, and its influence on spatial temperature distribution...|$|E
40|$|Dates of {{start and}} end of frost based on minimum shelter {{temperature}} equal to or less than 0 °C were studied in Zanjan, Ghazvin and Tehran during 1961 - 2000. The cause of these frosts was determined by weather parameter values at observation hours and the aid of synoptic maps. Frost series based upon last spring or first fall advection are defined and found to be random and normally distributed. The &quot;potential growing season&quot;, defined as the interval between spring last and first fall advection frosts, {{is found to be}} 29 days in Zanjan, 23 days in Ghazvin and 10 days in Tehran longer than the &quot;growing season&quot; defined by the interval from last spring to first fall occurrences of minimum shelter temperature of 0 °C or less. The numbers of radiation frosts in the interval between first radiation frosts in fall or last radiation frost in spring and related <b>advection</b> <b>frost</b> were counted and found that this parameter is greater in Zanjan. Frostless days between the first two fall frosts and last two spring frosts show that the lengthening of spring season with one night protection is possible for 4 days in Zanjan, 6 in Gazvin and 4 in Tehran, providing that first fall and spring last frost is radiation. Results of this study permit estimating the practicality of frost protection for specialized crops in the area of study...|$|E
