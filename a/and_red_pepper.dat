2500|$|LaDou {{had learned}} pizza-making in the 1970s as a {{teenager}} at Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too, a traditional New York-style pizzeria in Mountain View, California.

60|$|He felt strangely {{reluctant}} to move; the fatigue {{he had for}} a time shaken off returned with puzzling suddenness and threatened to overpower him. His head was very heavy, he could hardly hear the people talk, {{and every now and}} then his eyes shut. He could not keep them open, but after a few minutes he straightened his bent shoulders with a resolute jerk and clenched his fist. It was not fatigue that was mastering him; the wine was drugged. He had not noted a suspicious taste, but he was thirsty and the omelette was strongly flavored with garlic <b>and</b> <b>red</b> <b>pepper.</b>|$|E

60|$|Such {{a man was}} Captain John Scarrow, of {{the ship}} Morning Star, and yet he breathed a long sigh of relief {{when he heard the}} splash of the falling anchor and swung at his {{moorings}} within a hundred yards of the guns of the citadel of Basseterre. St. Kitt's was his final port of call, and early next morning his bowsprit would be pointed for Old England. He had had enough of those robber-haunted seas. Ever since he had left Maracaibo upon the Main, with his full lading of sugar <b>and</b> <b>red</b> <b>pepper,</b> he had winced at every topsail which glimmered over the violet edge of the tropical sea. He had coasted up the Windward Islands, touching here and there, and assailed continually by stories of villainy and outrage.|$|E

6000|$|Wallace and I had {{employed}} {{the last few}} warm sunny afternoons in riding {{up and down the}} valley, below Oak, where there was a fine, level stretch. Here I wore out my soreness of muscle, and gradually overcame my awkwardness in the saddle. Frank's remedy of maple sugar <b>and</b> <b>red</b> <b>pepper</b> had rid me of my cold, and with the return of strength, and the coming of confidence, full, joyous appreciation of wild environment and life made me unspeakably happy. And I noticed that my companions were in like condition of mind, though self-contained where I was exuberant. Wallace galloped his sorrel and watched the crags; Jones talked more kindly to the dogs; Jim baked biscuits indefatigably, and smoked in contented silence; Frank said always: [...] "We'll ooze along easy like, for we've all the time there is." [...] Which sentiment, whether from reiterated suggestion, or increasing confidence in the practical cowboy, or charm of its free import, gradually won us all.|$|E
6000|$|When he met Purun Bhagat's eyes--the {{eyes of a}} man used {{to control}} thousands--he bowed to the earth, took the begging-bowl without a word, and {{returned}} to the village, saying, [...] "We have at last a holy man. Never have I seen such a man. He is of the Plains--but pale-coloured--a Brahmin of the Brahmins." [...] Then all the housewives of the village said, [...] "Think you he will stay with us?" [...] and each did her best to cook the most savoury meal for the Bhagat. Hill-food is very simple, but with buckwheat and Indian corn, and rice <b>and</b> <b>red</b> <b>pepper,</b> and little fish out of the stream in the valley, and honey from the flue-like hives built in the stone walls, and dried apricots, and turmeric, and wild ginger, and bannocks of flour, a devout woman can make good things, and it was a full bowl that the priest carried to the Bhagat. Was he going to stay? asked the priest. Would he need a chela--a disciple--to beg for him? Had he a blanket against the cold weather? Was the food good? ...|$|E
6000|$|On the 11th of January I {{was sent}} {{for by the}} Gerad and {{received}} the second mule. At noon we were visited by the Shaykh Jami, who, after a long discourse upon the subject of Sufiism [44], invited me to inspect his books. When midday prayer was concluded we walked to his house, which occupies the very centre of the city: in its courtyard is [...] "Gay Humburti," [...] the historic rock upon which Saint Nur held converse with the Prophet Khizr. The Shaykh, after seating us in a room about ten feet square, and lined with scholars and dusty tomes, began reading out a treatise upon the genealogies of the Grand Masters, and showed me in half a dozen tracts the tenets of the different schools. The only valuable MS. in the place was a fine old copy of the Koran; the Kamus and the Sihah were there [45], {{but by no means}} remarkable for beauty or correctness. Books at Harar are mostly antiques, copyists being exceedingly rare, and the square massive character is more like Cufic with diacritical points, than the graceful modern Naskhi. I could not, however, but admire the bindings: no Eastern country save Persia surpasses them in strength and appearance. After some desultory conversation the Shaykh ushered us into an inner room, or rather a dark closet partitioned off from the study, and ranged us around the usual dish of boiled beef, holcus bread, <b>and</b> <b>red</b> <b>pepper.</b> After returning to the study we sat for a few minutes,--Easterns rarely remain long after dinner,--and took leave, saying that we must call upon the Gerad Mohammed.|$|E
