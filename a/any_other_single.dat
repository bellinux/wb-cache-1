5|$|The middle–late Campanian {{formations}} show {{a greater}} diversity of dinosaurs than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>single</b> group of rocks. The late Maastrichtian rocks contain the largest members of several major clades: Tyrannosaurus, Ankylosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus, Triceratops, and Torosaurus, which suggests food was plentiful {{immediately prior to}} the extinction.|$|E
5|$|Herrmann {{used the}} lowered music budget to his {{advantage}} by writing for a string orchestra rather than a full symphonic ensemble, contrary to Hitchcock's request for a jazz score. He thought of the single tone color of the all-string soundtrack {{as a way of}} reflecting the black-and-white cinematography of the film. The strings play con sordini (muted) for all the music other than the shower scene, creating a darker and more intense effect. Film composer Fred Steiner, in an analysis of the score to Psycho, points out that string instruments gave Herrmann access to a wider range in tone, dynamics, and instrumental special effects than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>single</b> instrumental group would have.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{and high}} tech {{research}} and development operations {{are located in the}} city, including the Lowell Observatory, Northern Arizona University, the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS) and the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) Flagstaff campus. Lowell Observatory continues to be an active astronomical observatory and a popular visitors center which hosts educational displays and tours. It has a distributed network of small telescopes which together create images of celestial bodies with much higher resolutions than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>single</b> telescope can produce. Current research is involved in observations of near-Earth phenomena such as asteroids and comets. The observatory is also involved in a $30 million project with the Discovery Channel to build the Discovery Channel Telescope, a sophisticated, ground-based telescope with advanced optical capabilities for future projects. Lowell Observatory and NOFS are also collaborators on the major project, the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer, on nearby Anderson Mesa. NOFS is heavily involved with the science of star catalogs and astrometry, or the positions and distances of stars and celestial objects.|$|E

5|$|Trinidad and Tobago sent a {{delegation}} {{to compete at}} the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. Its participation in the Beijing games marked its eighteenth Olympic appearance and fifteenth Summer Olympic appearance since its debut at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, excluding its joint participation with Jamaica and Barbados in 1960 as the West Indies Federation. With 28 athletes, more Trinidadians had competed at the Olympics than in <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>single</b> Olympic games in its history before Beijing. Athletes representing Trinidad and Tobago advanced past the preliminary or qualification rounds in twelve events and reached the final rounds in four of those events. Of those four events, silver medals were won in the men's 100meters (by Richard Thompson) and in the men's 4x100meters relay (by Keston Bledman, Marc Burns, Emmanuel Callender, Richard Thompson, and Aaron Armstrong, {{who participated in the}} first round only). The latter can be upgraded to gold due to one member of the quartet that crossed the line first, Nesta Carter, tested positive for a banned substance. The nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony that year was swimmer and Athens medalist George Bovell.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic mammals {{are also}} present in the bay. Before 1825, Spanish, French, English, Russians and Americans were drawn to the Bay Area to harvest prodigious {{quantities}} of beaver, river otter, marten, fisher, mink, fox, weasel, harbor and fur seals and sea otter. This early fur trade, known as the California Fur Rush, was more than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>single</b> factor, responsible for opening up the West and the San Francisco Bay Area, in particular, to world trade. By 1817 sea otter in the area were practically eliminated. Since then, the California golden beaver has re-established {{a presence in the}} Alhambra Creek. The North American river otter which was first reported in Redwood Creek at Muir Beach in 1996, has since been spotted in the North Bay's Corte Madera Creek, the South Bay's Coyote Creek, as well as in 2010 in San Francisco Bay itself at the Richmond Marina. Other mammals include the internationally famous sea lions who began inhabiting San Francisco's Pier 39 after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the locally famous Humphrey the Whale, a humpback whale who entered San Francisco Bay twice on errant migrations in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises have recently returned to the bay, having been absent for many decades. Historically, this was the northern extent of their warm-water species range.|$|E

5000|$|Morning Sun spawned three singles between 1989 and 1990. The lead single, [...] "You Wouldn't Know Love (If It Looked You in the Eye)" [...] was {{released}} in November 1989. The song failed to chart on the United States' Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart, but did peak at #81 on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart in early March 1990. The single became Mandrell's final single to chart in Canada and <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>singles</b> chart. The album's second and third singles entitled [...] "You've Become the Dream" [...] and [...] "The Nearness of You" [...] were both released in 1990, but both failed to chart the Billboard and RPM country singles charts. The album itself {{was released}} in April 1990 and also failed to chart, not reaching Billboard Top Country Albums chart.|$|R

5000|$|... "MC's Act Like They Don't Know" [...] is a {{song from}} KRS-One's 1995 eponymous album. It {{contains}} production from DJ Premier that samples [...] "Yesterdays" [...] by Clifford Brown, and interpolates [...] "The Breaks" [...] by Kurtis Blow. Its lyrics deal with how lots of rappers who achieve positive chart positions and other commercial awards cannot perform well live. Ironically, it holds higher chart positions than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> KRS-One <b>single.</b>|$|R

25|$|The weapon most {{associated}} with the Dacian forces that fought against Trajan's army during his invasions of Dacia was the falx, a single-edged scythe-like weapon. The falx was able to inflict horrible wounds on opponents, easily disabling or killing the heavily armored Roman legionaries that they faced. This weapon, more so than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>single</b> factor, forced the Roman army to adopt previously unused or modified equipment to suit the conditions on the Dacian battlefield.|$|E

5000|$|In 2002, Gregg {{placed a}} phone call to Innis, with whom he had not had any contact in ten years. That led to Restless Heart reuniting once again and {{returning}} the band to its complete original lineup. They soon began touring and released a single called [...] "Torch of Freedom" [...] which did not chart. In 2004, the band signed to Koch Records, then went into a Muscle Shoals, Alabama, recording studio to record the first full-length album to feature the original lineup since 1990's Fast Movin' Train. The new album, entitled Still Restless, was co-produced by Mac McAnally and Kyle Lehning, with three of its songs having been previously been recorded by McAnally himself. Its lead-off single, [...] "Feel My Way to You", peaked at No. 29 on the country music charts. However, Koch closed its Nashville division in early 2005, and the album did not produce <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>singles.</b> The band released a live album, 25 and Live, in 2007 through their website.|$|R

The Operation Meetinghouse raid on Tokyo on the night of 9/10 March 1945 stands as the deadliest air raid in human history, killing 100,000 civilians and destroying 16 square miles of the city that night, which caused more civilian deaths and damage to urbanized land than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>single</b> air attack, including the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.|$|E
25|$|In a 2001 federal lawsuit, Vieques’ {{environmental}} groups and residents accused the Navy of causing “more damage than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>single</b> {{actor in the}} history of Puerto Rico”. The prosecutors stated that the Navy’s activities contaminated much of the eastern portion of the island {{with a wide range of}} toxic substances. As cited by Franciscans International, according to the Navy’s figures, throughout the course of six decades about 5 million pounds (2,000 t) of ordnance was dropped on Vieques every year. Ordnance included toxic compounds and elements such as arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium, depleted uranium and napalm, and tons of a fiberglass-like substance. Most of these toxins are persistent, meaning that they bioaccumulate.|$|E

HIV/AIDS is increasing dramatically, especially in India, which leads the world in absolute numbers of HIV/AIDS infections, estimated at 3–5 million. China is better off {{than most of the}} countries to its south, but it too has a growing AIDS problem, with HIV infections variously estimated at 100,000 to 4000,000. and spreading rapidly.
