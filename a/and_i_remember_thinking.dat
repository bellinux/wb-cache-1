DeWitt {{was given a}} recurring role in the season as Don's mistress, which lasted for six episodes. She initially felt out of place while playing out her character. DeWitt stated, [...] "They were {{at the end of}} casting, and hadn't found the right Midge yet. Originally they had a scene where she opens the door wearing a red kimono, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> 'I'm not that', so I wasn’t sure I was right for the part. Maybe the fact that I wasn't this 'vamp' is what made Matt Weiner give me a shot." [...] Prior to working on Mad Men, Siff mainly worked in theatre and performing arts.|$|E
500|$|Rodriguez wrote Machete in 1993 {{as a full}} {{feature for}} Danny Trejo. [...] "I had cast him in Desperado <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'Wow, this guy should have his own series of Mexploitation movies like Charles Bronson or like Jean-Claude Van Damme.' So I wrote him this idea of a federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard {{sometimes}} FBI or DEA have a really tough job that they don't {{want to get their}} own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, 'That's Machete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for {{a lot of money to}} him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts.' But I never got around to making it." [...] The trailer was made into a feature film which was released in September 2010; a sequel, Machete Kills (2013), followed.|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Partition" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava and was shot at the Parisian cabaret club, Crazy Horse. It was filmed quickly as Jay-Z had to travel to London for a concert after the shooting. In a video commentary to the album, Beyoncé said: [...] "The day that I got engaged was my husband's birthday and I took him to Crazy Horse. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'Damn, these girls are fly.' I {{just thought it was}} the ultimate sexy show I've ever seen. And I was like, 'I wish I was up there, I wish I could perform that for my man...' So that's what I did for the video." [...] Talking about the video, Nava noted that for the shooting Beyoncé was trying to be [...] "even more risque than she's been in the past". While filming, he further tried to [...] "create and capture a bit of genuine intimacy" [...] between the singer and her husband. During a commentary about the video for the song, Beyoncé revealed her motivation to film it by saying, ...|$|E

Subsequently, alcohol played a {{considerable}} part in his life, although he says, [...] "I never became an alcoholic, mainly because my guts quickly staled".|$|R
5000|$|Rodriguez {{started taking}} Suzuki Violin Lessons at her public {{elementary}} school at age 5. Her teacher, Bill Dick, remained her principal violin teacher until she left Austin at age 17 to begin music conservatory. When {{asked why she}} chose to learn Violin {{at such a young}} age, she admits [...] "I was really bad at nap-time. I would talk through the whole thing. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> already had a parent/teacher conference about it. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> getting up {{to go to the bathroom}} and walking down the hall during nap-time and hearing the little squawky beginner violin playing 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> just <b>remember</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'Oh, man, this is what I should be doing.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Charles to make a funny [...] "dark-themed" [...] episode, using {{elements}} that were unusual in sitcoms. Sets for the episode were built, and Bobbi Jo Lathan was cast as flight attendant Lucy Merrit and Ernie Sabella was cast as gun salesman Mo Korn, who was described in the script as [...] "overweight, greasy, slow and low-key". The table reading of the episode was held on December 12, 1990. Louis-Dreyfus stated, [...] "I read the script <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> 'we're {{not going to do}} this'." [...] According to Alexander, when she read a scene in which she holds the gun to her head stating [...] "where do you want it Jerry? The Kennedy? [...] The McKinley?" [...] (referencing the assassination of the two American presidents), Louis-Dreyfus turned to Alexander, stating [...] "I'm not doing this." [...] Both Alexander and Cherones, who would direct the episode, felt that the gun content in the story was too provocative. Richards was concerned that his character would be open about arming Elaine, though in a later interview he stated [...] "although, why not? I think Kramer could justify the use of a weapon." ...|$|E
500|$|Rowland has {{acknowledged}} {{on several occasions}} that although she loved dance music, it was not really the type of music she would record. While in Europe in 2008, she met Guetta {{at one of his}} DJ shows in Southern France and commented that [...] "Listening to him was just crazy." [...] Guetta was playing the instrumental version of [...] "When Love Takes Over". Recalling that it brought tears to her eyes, Rowland remarked, [...] "I felt so much emotion from the track; something happened the first time I heard it, and it was just beautiful. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> 'Why is this touching me like this?' You know, it was like there was a kinda soul-tie to it!" [...] Upon meeting Guetta, she asked him for the song so she could write its lyrics. [...] "So I met David and asked him for the track... He gave it to me, and I brought it back here to London, UK and wrote the actual song". At a writing session in a London hotel room, Rowland and songwriting duo Nervo wrote the lyrics and melody over Guetta's backing track. Rowland later joined Guetta and Julie Terry Lefèvre-Han in the recording studio to finish off the song.|$|E

It was painful. Because I {{wanted to be on}} that stage singing with those guys... But back then I always played those quirky characters. I didn’t get those fancy leads. I got those best friend of the leads, quirky, funny characters. Hookers with a heart of gold. Weirdos." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bringing Down the Horse further explores roots sounds {{heard on}} the band's {{previous}} self-titled album but used a more refined approach. This album features an array of instruments normally associated with roots music including banjos, dobros and pedal steel guitars. Dylan commented on {{the sound of the}} record by saying, [...] "You can counter different sounds and different things. We were in a certain channel already, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> if we mixed it organically, and we kept chasing that sound, it probably would sound dated. I wasn’t interested in making a throwback record from the 60's or 70's. I didn’t have any interest in doing that. And {{that was one of the}} reasons we had Tom Lord-Alge, who was a very current mixer at the time. We thought that he could counter a lot of these acoustic sounds with something that sounded really fresh and up to date." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 20 November 1968, {{two days}} before the release of The Beatles, McCartney gave Radio Luxembourg an {{exclusive}} interview, in which he commented on several of the album's songs. Speaking of [...] "Helter Skelter", he said: [...] "Umm, that came about just 'cause I'd read a review of a record which said, 'and this group really got us wild, there's echo on everything, they're screaming their heads off.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> just <b>remember</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'Oh, it'd be great to do one. Pity they've done it. Must be great – really screaming record.' <b>And</b> then <b>I</b> heard their record and it was quite straight, and it was very sort of sophisticated. It wasn't rough and screaming and tape echo at all. So I thought, 'Oh well, we'll do one like that, then.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> had this song called 'Helter Skelter,' which is just a ridiculous song. So we did it like that, 'cuz I like noise." ...|$|R

"It {{seemed to}} take the {{conductor}} by surprise, and he faced towards the stateroom and let the lantern slip off his arm, and it dropped onto the floor <b>and</b> went out; <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> what a good thing it didn't set the car on fire. But there in the dark--for the car lamps went {{out at the same}} time with the lantern--I could hear those fellows pulling and hauling up and down the aisle and scuffling over the floor, and through all Melford bellowing away, like an orchestral accompaniment to a combat in Wagner opera, but getting quieter and quieter till his bellow died away altogether. At the same time the row in the aisle of the car stopped, and there was perfect silence, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could hear the snow rattling against my window.

Between them they had ₤30 and a deal table {{containing}} her engraving tools, but [...] "Light-hearted indifference, however, to many things generally regarded as essential lent boldness to domestic arrangements, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> it quite natural {{that in the middle}} of the morning I should ask our only maid - a pretty one - to stand for me that I may try to draw her; to which she, being good tempered as well as pretty, cheerfully consented." ...|$|E
2500|$|Planet Terror is {{preceded by}} a fake trailer for a film titled Machete, {{starring}} Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin, as it had during the original [...] "double feature" [...] presentation of Grindhouse. Rodriguez wrote Machete in 1993 as a full feature for Danny Trejo. [...] "I had cast him in Desperado <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'Wow, this guy should have his own series of Mexican exploitation movies like Charles Bronson or like Jean-Claude Van Damme.'

[...] It was later announced that the trailer would be made as a feature film Machete.

60|$|He {{had just}} renounced his velveteen, {{and even those}} cuffs turned {{backward}} over the sleeves, and had begun to dress very carefully in the fashion of the moment. He lived in a little house at Chelsea that the architect Godwin had decorated with an elegance that owed something to Whistler. There was nothing mediaeval, nor Pre-Raphaelite, no cupboard door with figures upon flat gold, no peacock blue, no dark background. I remember vaguely a white drawing room with Whistler etchings, 'let in' to white panels, and a dining room all white: chairs, walls, mantlepiece, carpet, except for a diamond-shaped piece of red cloth {{in the middle of}} the table under a terra cotta statuette, and I think a red shaded lamp hanging from the ceiling to a little above the statuette.

I remember now, for it was just above the marriage-ring I grasped it when I pulled its tail out. I didn't pull it off, for it wouldn't come off; it came out like a telescope or a long piece of indiarubber. Ha! <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> how painful it must be. That was odd, now, to think of that. The other elephant had on crinoline. That was odder still; for of all animals in the world it least required it. Well, let me see. What did I do? Oh yes, I shot them both. Of course, that was natural; but it wasn't quite so natural that the big one should vomit up a live lion, which attacked me with incredible fury. But I killed it cleverly. Yes, it was a clever thing, undoubtedly, to split a lion in two, from the tip of its nose to the extremity of its tail, with one stroke of a penknife--" ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{knowledge}} of Mr. William Morris's poetry begins in years {{so far away}} that they seem like reminiscences of another existence. I remember sitting beneath Cardinal Beaton's ruined castle at St. Andrews, looking across the bay to the sunset, while some one repeated [...] "Two Red Roses across the Moon." [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> that the poem was nonsense. With Mr. Morris's other early verses, [...] "The Defence of Guinevere," [...] this song of {{the moon and the}} roses was published in 1858. Probably the little book won no attention; it is not popular even now. Yet the lyrics remain in memories which forget all but a general impression of the vast [...] "Earthly Paradise," [...] that huge decorative poem, in which slim maidens and green-clad men, and waters wan, and flowering apple trees, and rich palaces are all mingled as on some long ancient tapestry, shaken a little by the wind of death. They are not living and breathing people, these persons of the fables; they are but shadows, beautiful and faint, and their poem is fit reading for sleepy summer afternoons. But the characters in the lyrics in [...] "The Defence of Guinevere" [...] are people of flesh and blood, under their chain armour and their velvet, and the trappings of their tabards.|$|E

6000|$|I saw a {{good deal}} of Wilde at that time--was it 1887 or 1888?--I have no way of fixing the date except that I had {{published}} my first book The Wanderings of Usheen and that Wilde had not yet published his Decay of Lying. He had, before our first meeting, reviewed my book and despite its vagueness of intention, and the inexactness of its speech, praised without qualification; and what was worth more than any review he had talked about it and now he asked me to eat my Christmas dinner with him believing, I imagine, that I was alone in London. He had just renounced his velveteen, and even those cuffs turned backward over the sleeves, and had begun to dress very carefully in the fashion of the moment. He lived in a little house at Chelsea that the architect Godwin had decorated with an elegance that owed something to Whistler.

6000|$|I {{had almost}} avoided the general election, {{but some of}} its consequences, on my return, had smartly to be faced. The season, in London, began to breathe again and to flap its folded wings. Confidence, under the new Ministry, was {{understood}} to be reviving, {{and one of the}} symptoms, in a social body, was a recovery of appetite. People once more fed together, and it happened that, one Saturday night, at somebody's house, I fed with George Gravener. When the ladies left the room I moved up to where he sat and begged to congratulate him. [...] "On my election?" [...] he asked after a moment; so that I could feign, jocosely, not to have heard of that triumph and to be alluding to the rumour of a victory still more personal. I dare say I coloured however, for his political success had momentarily passed out of my mind. What was present to it was that he was to marry that beautiful girl; and yet his question made me conscious of some discomposure--I hadn't intended to put this before everything. He himself indeed ought gracefully to have done so, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>thinking</b> the whole man was in this assumption that in expressing my sense of what he had won I had fixed my thoughts on his [...] "seat." [...] We straightened the matter out, and he was so much lighter in hand than I had lately seen him that his spirits might well have been fed from a twofold source. He was so good as to say that he hoped I should soon make the acquaintance of Miss Anvoy, who, with her aunt, was presently coming up to town. Lady Coxon, in the country, had been seriously unwell, and this had delayed their arrival. I told him I had heard the marriage would be a splendid one; on which, brightened and humanised by his luck, he laughed and said [...] "Do you mean for HER?" [...] When I had again explained what I meant he went on: [...] "Oh she's an American, but you'd scarcely know it; unless, perhaps," [...] he added, [...] "by her being used to more money than most girls in England, even the daughters of rich men. That wouldn't in the least do for a fellow like me, you know, if it wasn't for the great liberality of her father. He really has been most kind, and everything's quite satisfactory." [...] He added that his eldest brother had taken a tremendous fancy to her and that during a recent visit at Coldfield she had nearly won over Lady Maddock. I gathered from something he dropped later on that the free-handed gentleman beyond the seas had not made a settlement, but had given a handsome present and was apparently to be looked to, across the water, for other favours. People are simplified alike by great contentments and great yearnings, and, whether or no it was Gravener's directness that begot my own, I seem to recall that in some turn taken by our talk he almost imposed it on me as an act of decorum to ask if Miss Anvoy had also by chance expectations from her aunt. My enquiry drew out that Lady Coxon, who was the oddest of women, would have in any contingency to act under her late husband's will, which was odder still, saddling her with a mass of queer obligations complicated with queer loopholes. There were several dreary people, Coxon cousins, old maids, to whom she would have more or less to minister. Gravener laughed, without saying no, when I suggested that the young lady might come in through a loophole; then suddenly, as if he suspected my turning a lantern on him, he declared quite dryly: [...] "That's all rot--one's moved by other springs!" ...|$|E
