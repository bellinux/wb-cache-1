5|$|A recent {{necropsy}} {{study of}} captive elk in Pennsylvania <b>attributed</b> <b>the</b> {{cause of death}} in 33 of 65 cases to either gastrointestinal parasites (21 cases, primarily Eimeria sp. and Ostertagia sp.) or bacterial infections (12 cases, mostly pneumonia).|$|E
5|$|After the war, all {{the cast}} members also disclaimed responsibility, {{pleading}} {{that they had}} been coerced into participating in the film. According to his biographer Friedrich Knilli, Marian never came to terms with his having accepted the role of Süß and became an alcoholic, dying shortly after the war in a 1946 car accident. Some have <b>attributed</b> <b>the</b> accident to suicide.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>attributes</b> {{are divided}} into two groups: {{synthesized}} attributes and inherited <b>attributes.</b> <b>The</b> synthesized <b>attributes</b> are <b>the</b> result of <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> evaluation rules, and may also use the values of <b>the</b> inherited <b>attributes.</b> <b>The</b> inherited <b>attributes</b> are passed down from parent nodes.|$|R

30|$|Mapper: The “mapper” tag {{is used to}} {{describe}} the mapping relationship between attributes of elements. There are usually two <b>attributes</b> in <b>the</b> “mapper” tag, the key and value <b>attributes.</b> <b>The</b> value <b>attribute</b> describes <b>the</b> target <b>attribute</b> in <b>the</b> customized model and <b>the</b> key <b>attribute</b> describes <b>the</b> target <b>attribute</b> in Cloud resource runtime models. The element, which <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> belong to, is defined in the outer “helper” tag.|$|R
5|$|Although several {{survivors}} {{claimed to}} have seen a submarine sail with yellow and red insignia, a Navy inquiry <b>attributed</b> <b>the</b> sinking to a boiler explosion. The Navy reversed its findings in 2001 {{to acknowledge that the}} sinking was due to hostile fire and awarded Purple Hearts to the survivors and next-of-kin of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|Beekeepers in Scotland also {{reported}} losses {{for the past}} three years. Andrew Scarlett, a Perthshire-based bee farmer and honey packer, lost 80% of his 1,200 hives during the 2009/10 winter. He <b>attributed</b> <b>the</b> losses to a virulent bacterial infection that quickly spread {{because of a lack of}} bee inspectors, coupled with sustained poor weather that prevented honey bees from building up sufficient pollen and nectar stores.|$|E
5|$|Commentators <b>attributed</b> <b>the</b> {{mismanagement}} behind Enron’s fall to {{a variety}} of ethical and political-economic causes. Ethical explanations centered on executive greed and hubris, a lack of corporate social responsibility, situation ethics, and get-it-done business pragmatism. Political-economic explanations cited post-1970s deregulation, and inadequate staff and funding for regulatory oversight. A more libertarian analysis maintained that Enron’s collapse resulted from the company’s reliance on political lobbying, rent-seeking, and the gaming of regulations.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>attributes</b> of man are {{a mark of}} {{the absence}} of <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> omnipotence, <b>The</b> <b>attributes</b> of a king are a mark of <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> of man, {{therefore}} <b>The</b> <b>attributes</b> of a king are a mark {{of the absence of}} <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> signified by <b>the</b> word omnipotent (or, are evidence of the absence of that attribute).|$|R
30|$|Using {{the same}} logic for a non-beneficial <b>attribute,</b> <b>the</b> minimum loss is taken as zero when <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> value is at minimum and the maximum loss is taken as one when <b>the</b> <b>attribute</b> {{possesses}} <b>the</b> maximum value.|$|R

5|$|Dr. Alexander Cruikshank of the Sudan Medical Services <b>attributed</b> <b>the</b> {{epidemic}} {{in part to}} poor housing conditions.

5|$|Joyce {{dissipated}} {{in an area}} of low {{wind shear}} and warm sea surface temperatures. The National Hurricane Center <b>attributed</b> <b>the</b> weakening to dry air from the Sahara.

30|$|Helper: The “helper” tag {{is used to}} {{describe}} the mapping relationship between elements. There are usually three <b>attributes</b> in <b>the</b> “helper” tag, <b>the</b> key <b>attribute,</b> <b>the</b> value <b>attribute</b> and <b>the</b> type <b>attribute.</b> <b>The</b> value <b>attribute</b> describes <b>the</b> target element in the customized model and <b>the</b> key <b>attribute</b> describes <b>the</b> target element in Cloud resource runtime models. <b>The</b> type <b>attribute</b> describes <b>the</b> type of the mapping relationship. When its value is “basic”, it is a one-to-one mapping relationship or a many-to-one mapping relationship. When its value is “multi”, it is a one-to-many mapping relationship. The “helper” tag is used {{to describe}} the mapping relationship between elements. Elements often have attributes or other elements, so the “helper” tag usually nests “helper” tags, “mapper” tags and “query” tags.|$|R

5|$|The film also rescues {{a central}} concept in the comics, {{the fact that}} {{radiation}} {{is one of the}} causes of genetic mutation in the X-Men fictional universe, and incorporates it in the storyline, resurrecting the concept which went unused in the last years, as writers in the comics more recently have <b>attributed</b> <b>the</b> phenomenon of mutation mostly to evolution and natural selection.|$|E
5|$|The first Argentine historians, such as Bartolomé Mitre, <b>attributed</b> <b>the</b> {{free trade}} to The Representation of the Hacendados {{economic}} report by Mariano Moreno, but is currently considered {{the result of}} a general negotiation between Britain and Spain, as reflected in the Apodaca-Canning treaty of 1809. The actions of Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros in Buenos Aires reflected similar outcomes emanating from the other Spanish cities of South America.|$|E
5|$|Williams shipped around 1,000units of Joust 2, {{significantly}} fewer than its predecessor. Brett Alan Weiss of Allgame and Mike Bevan of Retro Gamer <b>attributed</b> <b>the</b> poor numbers to an industry slump in the mid-1980s.

5|$|A {{large portion}} of the Persian army was trapped in its camp and slaughtered. The {{destruction}} of this army, and the remnants of the Persian navy allegedly on the same day at the Battle of Mycale, decisively ended the invasion. After Plataea and Mycale the Greek allies would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Plataea was in every sense a resounding victory, {{it does not seem to}} have been <b>attributed</b> <b>the</b> same significance (even at the time) as, for example, the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon or the Spartan defeat at Thermopylae.|$|E
5|$|According to Hayes' confession, {{the two men}} {{had planned}} to rob the Petit house under cover of {{darkness}} leaving the family bound, but unharmed. Hayes <b>attributed</b> <b>the</b> outcome to a change of plan. Upon their arrival {{in the early hours of}} July 23, they found William Petit sleeping on a couch on the porch. Komisarjevsky struck William on the head with a baseball bat found in the yard and then tied him up at gunpoint in the basement. The children and their mother were then bound and locked in their respective rooms. Hayes said that he and Komisarjevsky were not satisfied with their haul, and that a bankbook was found which showed an available balance.|$|E

In an analysis in early 2007, science writer Carl Zimmer found evidence that much of what appeared to be inaccurate or inadequate information about science and scientific theory could be traced back to an over-reliance on citations from the works of home-schooling textbook author Jay L.
