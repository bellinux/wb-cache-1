25|$|Tropical Discovery {{was opened}} in 1993. The {{building}} explores several tropical environments and displays mammals, reptiles, fish, amphibians and insects from these areas. The trip {{begins with a}} view into a South American river with different species of freshwater stingray then continues to a cave where guests are immersed within the community of several bat species including the vampire bat. A snake exhibit hidden inside a Mayan temple features several venomous species including the king cobra and eyelash viper. Other South American animals here include capybara, black howler monkey, arapaima, piranha and poison dart frog. Further on, visitors are immersed in a coral reef with epaulette sharks, clownfish, yellow tang, lionfish and garden eels. Around the corner, a gallery of North American snakes is located across from <b>alligator</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> and other North American reptiles and fish in a large pool. Further on, Siamese crocodile lurk in their pool amongst other swamp species like mata mata. The Komodo dragon exhibit was the largest of its kind at opening and {{is still one of}} the largest Komodo dragon exhibits in the country.|$|E
500|$|Other TNACI {{projects}} include conservation genetics {{research on}} fish species, including the blue shiner, flame chub, laurel dace, and Conasauga logperch, {{and the development}} of the Freshwater Information Network (FIN), a database of current and historic locality information for 62 southeastern fish species in peril.

50|$|In June 2006, <b>alligator</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles,</b> {{which are}} a {{non-native}} species, {{were found in the}} pond, and there is the possibility that they are breeding.

50|$|Despite their reputation, <b>alligator</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> are {{typically}} not prone to biting. However, if provoked {{they are quite}} capable of delivering a powerful bite which can easily amputate fingers or cause other significant injuries. Some U.S states where <b>alligator</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> do not naturally occur (such as California) prohibit them from being kept as pets by residents.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>alligator</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> were {{released}} or escaped into {{waters of the}} Czech Republic and Germany. In Bavaria, one turtle caused injury of a child, but was not caught. In Bohemia, four turtles of this species have been caught.

500|$|Many {{aggressive}} mimics use {{the promise}} of nourishment {{as a way of}} attracting prey.

Its tongue bears a conspicuous pink extension that resembles a worm and can be wriggled around; fish that try to eat the [...] "worm" [...] are themselves eaten by the turtle. Similarly, some snakes employ caudal luring (using the tail) or lingual luring (using the tongue) to entice small vertebrates into striking range.|$|E

50|$|Contrary to {{claims that}} <b>alligator</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> possess {{one of the}} strongest bite forces of any animal, it has been {{recorded}} at , which is lower than several other species of turtles and at about the same level as humans, relative to the turtle's body size. Still, these turtles must be handled with extreme care and considered potentially dangerous. This species can bite through the handle of a broom and rare cases have been reported where human fingers have been cleanly bitten off by the species. No human deaths have been reported to have been caused by <b>alligator</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Owing to past exploitation, the {{ecosystems}} of {{the lake}} have been placed under stress. Marshes, for example, are turning to open water, and cypress swamps are being killed by salt water intrusion. However, Brown Pelicans and Bald Eagles, once scarce, are now a common sight along the shores. A team of experts assembled by The Nature Conservancy assessed the situation in 2004. They identified seven target habitat types that were in particular need of conservation management: bottomland hardwood forest, cypress swamp, relict ridge woodland, fresh/intermediate marsh, brackish/salt marsh, lake open water, and littoral submersed aquatic vegetation. [...] The bottomland hardwood forest and cypress swamp are suffering from lack of fresh water input and sediment deposition owing to the levees upstream from the lake. In addition, bottomland hardwoods are being invaded by exotic species such as Chinese tallow while freshwater marshes are being invaded by exotic species such as elephant's-ear. The team also identified four key animal species that could indicate {{the degree to which}} the system declines or improves. [...] These were rangia clam (representing lake bottom habitat), gulf sturgeon and paddlefish (representing fish communities) and the <b>alligator</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> (one of the largest freshwater turtles in the world, but in decline owing to over- harvesting). The future {{of the lake}} depends, in part, on restoring annual spring floods to the wetlands of the lake basin, and controlling urban sprawl on the North shore. [...] Selected species, like the paddlefish and <b>alligator</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle,</b> would benefit from reduced harvesting. The lake could change considerably without such conservation planning. [...] A few examples of future change might include more cypress swamps converting to anthropogenic marsh or open water, Chinese tallow displacing native forests, and, with a warming climate, mangrove trees replacing brackish marsh.|$|E

40|$|We {{conducted}} a mark-recapture study of <b>Alligator</b> <b>Snapping</b> <b>Turtles,</b> Macrochelys temminckii, on Salado Creek (Independence Co., Arkansas) during 10 trapping seasons, which spanned a 20 -year period (1995 – 2015). We trapped {{a total of}} 163 <b>Alligator</b> <b>Snapping</b> <b>Turtles</b> during 416 trap nights and recorded a total of 35 recaptures during this study. Both the catch per unit effort (CPUE) and Jolly-Seber approaches demonstrated that this population benefitted from removal of harvest pressure, thus leading {{to an increase in}} abundance of <b>Alligator</b> <b>Snapping</b> <b>Turtles</b> in the lower ~ 5 km of the creek. The CPUE averaged slightly greater than 0. 24 (317 trap nights) during the first 4 years (1995 – 1998). The CPUE also showed an increase to 0. 64 by 2001 (only 14 trap nights), and then dramatically increased during the final 5 years to 0. 92 (85 trap nights). The population size estimates during the early period of the study (1995 – 2001) ranged from 20 turtles in 1995 to as many as 88 turtles in 1998, whereas the population size estimates from 2011 - 2015 ranged from 105 turtles in 2011 to as many as 282 turtles in 2015. Within our sample, recaptured males grew faster on average than females or juveniles in both straight carapace length and mass. These data, however, should be used with caution as age was not known.

50|$|<b>Alligator</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> are {{sometimes}} captive-bred as pets and {{are readily available}} in the exotic animal trade. Due to their potential size and specific needs, they do not make particularly good pets for any but the most experienced aquatic turtle keepers.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Alligator</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> {{seemingly}} {{most often}} hunt at night. They may also hunt diurnally, however. By day, they {{may try to}} attract fish and other prey by sitting quietly {{at the bottom of}} murky water and let their jaws hang open to reveal their tongues, which look like small, pink, worm-like lures {{in the back of their}} gray mouths, and lure the prey into striking distance. Small fish, such as minnows, are often caught in this way by younger <b>alligator</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles,</b> whereas adults must eat a greater quantity per day and must forage more actively. [...] Though not a regular food source for them, adult alligator snappers have even been known to kill and eat small American alligators.|$|R
