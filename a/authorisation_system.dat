In case the authorisation is refused the applicant will have the right of appeal in accordance with national law of the member state. The authorisation will be valid for five years. A travel authorisation with limited territorial validity may be issued only exceptionally. It is imagined as a system similar to the ESTA system of the United States and the ETA system of Canada. It is expected to enter into operation on 1 January 2020. The cost for developing ETIAS is estimated at EUR 212,1 million.|$|E

PERMIS supports the distributed assignment of both roles and attributes to users by multiple distributed attribute authorities, unlike the NIST model which assumes the centralised assignment of roles to users. PERMIS provides a cryptographically secure privilege management infrastructure (PMI) using public key encryption technologies and X.509 Attribute certificates to maintain users' attributes. PERMIS does not provide any authentication mechanism, but leaves {{it up to the}} application to determine what to use. PERMIS's strength comes from its ability to be integrated into virtually any application and any authentication scheme like Shibboleth (Internet2), Kerberos, username/passwords, Grid proxy certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).|$|E

40|$|From the Introduction. That the {{requirement}} of a prior authorisation, as a precondition for the exercise of any economic activity, may restrict the freedom of establishment and the free provision of services is a truism. If an authorisation is required in the Member State where establishment is to take place or the service is to be offered (host Member State), then operators who lack such authorisation are in no right to proceed to the projected activity. Therefore, {{as soon as it}} is being accepted that the EU internal market rules are not only about discriminatory measures, but also cover mere restrictions, {{it comes as no surprise}} that national <b>authorisation</b> <b>systems</b> come to be scrutinized under the Internal Market rules...|$|R

40|$|An <b>authorisation</b> <b>system</b> determines who is {{authorised}} {{to do what}} i. e. it assigns privileges {{to users}} and provides a decision on whether someone is allowed to perform a requested action on a resource. A traditional authorisation decision system, which is simply called <b>authorisation</b> <b>system</b> or system {{in the rest of}} the thesis, provides the decision based on a policy which is usually written by the system administrator. Such a traditional <b>authorisation</b> <b>system</b> is not sufficient to protect privacy of personal data, since users (the data subjects) are usually given a take it or leave it choice to accept the controlling organisation’s policy. Privacy is the ability of the owners or subjects of personal data to control the flow of data about themselves, according to their own preferences. This thesis describes the design of an <b>authorisation</b> <b>system</b> that will provide privacy for personal data by including sticky authorisation policies from the issuers and data subjects, to supplement the authorisation policy of the controlling organisation. As personal data moves from controlling system to controlling system, the sticky policies travel with the data. A number of data protection laws and regulations have been formulated to protect the privacy of individuals. The rights and prohibitions provided by the law need to be enforced by the <b>authorisation</b> <b>system.</b> Hence, the designed <b>authorisation</b> <b>system</b> also includes the authorisation rules from the legislation. This thesis describes the conversion of rules from the EU Data Protection Directive into machine executable rules. Due to the nature of the legislative rules, not all of them could be converted into deterministic machine executable rules, as in several cases human intervention or human judgement is required. This is catered for by allowing the machine rules to be configurable. Since the system includes independent policies from various authorities (law, issuer, data subject and controller) conflicts may arise among the decisions provided by them. Consequently, this thesis describes a dynamic, automated conflict resolution mechanism. Different conflict resolution algorithms are chosen based on the request contexts. As the EU Data Protection Directive allows processing of personal data based on contracts, we designed and implemented a component, Contract Validation Service (ConVS) that can validate an XML based digital contract to allow processing of personal data based on a contract. The <b>authorisation</b> <b>system</b> has been implemented as a web service and the performance of the system is measured, by first deploying it in a single computer and then in a cloud server. Finally the validity of the design and implementation are tested against a number of use cases based on scenarios involving accessing medical data in a health service provider’s system and accessing personal data such as CVs and degree certificates in an employment service provider’s system. The machine computed authorisation decisions are compared to the theoretical decisions to ensure that the system returns the correct decisions...|$|E
30|$|The {{distributed}} {{nature of}} OpenStack, {{and its ability}} to support multiple heterogeneous services, means that OpenStack components are arranged in a different way. For example, there are two Policy Decision Points (PDP), which require two sets of policies in the same system. This has implications on how OpenStack computes access decisions, and because of that self-adaptive solutions for dealing with authorisation, such as Self-Adaptive Authorisation Framework (SAAF) [2], cannot be directly used on OpenStack Keystone. Moreover, SAAF uses PERMIS [7] as <b>authorisation</b> <b>system,</b> which is different from OpenStack Keystone, and one of the differences is latter’s reliance on a token-based mechanism. The differences between these two authorisation systems, and the fact that in a system based feedback control loop the target system (in this case the <b>authorisation</b> <b>system)</b> influences the design of the controller [4], implies that a novel architectural solution is required for supporting for self-adaptive authorisation in OpenStack, which will be the topic of the next section.|$|E

40|$|<b>Authorisation</b> <b>systems</b> play a {{vital role}} in {{protecting}} access to resources in distributed <b>systems.</b> Traditionally, <b>authorisation</b> is performed at the user level to determine whether a user has the necessary privileges to access a requested resource. However, when it comes to the user's platform, it is often assumed that the system hosting the user and the software running on it are 'trusted' and that it will behave correctly. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive trust enhanced distributed authorisation architecture that provides a holistic framework for authorisation taking into account the state of a user platform. The model encompasses the notions of 'hard' and 'soft' trust to determine whether a platform can be trusted for authorisation. We first explain the rationale for the overall model and then describe our hybrid model with 'hard' and 'soft' trust components, followed by a description of the system architecture. We then illustrate proposed architecture in the context of a simple scenario involving a social networking system. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Providing {{effective}} Grid {{resource allocation}} mechanisms {{is a key}} factor in realising the Grid vision. In this talk, we present the SLA negotiation component developed in the Ontogrid project. We present the Insurance use case between insurance companies and repair services, where negotiation occurs through a broker service. Various negotiation protocols are implemented to provision a damage report and these are the contract net protocol, bilateral protocol and English auctions with timeouts. Strategies, preferences, and evaluation results are discussed. In {{the second part of the}} talk, we discuss how the existing negotiation service can be extended for trust negotiation between semantic web services. VO authorisation and online trust systems lack the ability to securely negotiate suitable trust and privacy requirements. Given the limitations of current VO <b>authorisation</b> <b>systems</b> when faced with malicious parties, this talk argues that trust can be built incrementally through trust negotiation, but without actual exchange of credentials until an SLA has been reached of what to exchange specifically. Finally we discuss if trust can help in SLA agreement.
