5|$|Metalwork was an {{important}} and well-developed craft, <b>and</b> <b>metal</b> tools such as axes, mammoties and hoes were widely used. Weapons and tools of iron and steel were produced in large scale for the military.

5|$|Mouthpieces are {{generally}} made of hard rubber, although some inexpensive mouthpieces {{may be made}} of plastic.

Other materials include wire, wire mesh, plastic, naugahyde, string, or leather.|$|E
40|$|This book {{covers all}} aspects of bioavailability, as related to {{environmental}} contaminants. After {{a discussion of the}} definition of bioavailability and its context, focus is placed on the role of risk assessment and bioavailability. Methods of analysis are then discussed including a range of atomic spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques for <b>metal</b> analysis <b>and</b> chromatographic approaches for persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The occurrence, properties and eco-toxicity of POPs <b>and</b> <b>metals</b> in the soil/sediment environment are discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on the uptake of POPs <b>and</b> <b>metals</b> by plants (phytoextraction). Examples of POPs <b>and</b> <b>metals</b> in the environment are reviewed. Methods to assess the bioavailability of POPs <b>and</b> <b>metals</b> in the environment are discussed. The particular approaches considered are: non-exhaustive extraction techniques; single extraction techniques; sequential extraction techniques; use of cyclodextrin and surfactants; in-vitro gastrointestinal methods including physiological-based extraction test; the use of bioasssays including earthworms. Finally, selected case studies highlight the importance of determining the bioavailability of POPs <b>and</b> <b>metals...</b>|$|R

5|$|After the war, Saunders was demobilised and {{returned}} to civilian life. He later served as a company commander with the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) during the Korean War, where he fought at the Battle of Kapyong. Saunders left the Army in 1954 {{and worked in the}} logging <b>and</b> <b>metal</b> industries, before joining the Office of Aboriginal Affairs (later the Department of Aboriginal Affairs) as a liaison officer in 1969. In 1971, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his community service. He died in 1990, aged 69.|$|E
5|$|Although {{these are}} not found on Earth naturally, boron forms a variety of stable {{compounds}} with formal oxidation state less than three. As for many covalent compounds, formal oxidation states are often of little meaning in boron hydrides <b>and</b> <b>metal</b> borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II). BF, isoelectronic with N2, cannot be isolated in condensed form, but B2F4 and B4Cl4 are well characterized.|$|E

5|$|Arise is {{the fourth}} studio album by Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura, {{released}} in 1991 by Roadrunner Records. Upon its release, the album received top reviews from heavy metal magazines such as Rock Hard, Kerrang! <b>and</b> <b>Metal</b> Forces. Arise is considered Sepultura's finest hour among longtime fans. While the music on Arise was mostly in the same death/thrash style as their previous album, Beneath the Remains, {{it was clear that}} the Sepultura sound was acquiring an experimental edge.|$|E
5|$|As {{printing}} became available, it {{was promptly}} used to publish herbals, the first printed matter being known as incunabula. In Europe, the first printed herbal with woodcut (xylograph) illustrations, the Puch der Natur of Konrad of Megenberg, appeared in 1475. Metal-engraved plates were first used in about 1580. As woodcuts <b>and</b> <b>metal</b> engravings could be reproduced indefinitely they were traded among printers: there was therefore a large {{increase in the}} number of illustrations together with an improvement in quality and detail but a tendency for repetition.|$|E
5|$|Because Triton's surface {{indicates}} {{a long history}} of melting, models of its interior posit that Triton is differentiated, like Earth, into a solid core, a mantle and a crust. Water, the most abundant volatile in the Solar System, comprises Triton's mantle, enveloping a core of rock <b>and</b> <b>metal.</b> There is enough rock in Triton's interior for radioactive decay to power convection in the mantle to this day. The heat may even be sufficient to maintain a global subsurface ocean similar to what is hypothesized to exist beneath the surface of Europa. If liquid water is present in Triton, it has been speculated that this could make it habitable for some form of life.|$|E

5|$|Buckets {{began to}} be {{replaced}} with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers <b>and</b> <b>metal</b> tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.|$|E
5|$|CMLL {{appeared}} to waver about the winner becoming the champion or just joining Stuka and Metro for a title match. CMLL's website indicated Delta won the championship, but Delta's team did not wear the championship belts {{prior to their}} first title match. Concurrent with the poll, CMLL started running an eight-team, three-week tournament to find new challengers for the new champions. Guadalajara regulars Palacio Negro, <b>and</b> <b>Metal</b> Blanco made their Mexico City debuts and qualified for the finals alongside Sagrado, but the team of Rush and the two poll losers, Ángel de Oro and Diamante, won the tournament and {{would go on to}} win the championship.|$|E
5|$|Certain Christian groups, {{most notably}} those in some King James Only denominations, {{consider}} {{all types of}} rock <b>and</b> <b>metal</b> music to be opposition to their faith, regardless of lyrical content or the lifestyles of the band members. However, fans and artists see metal as another genre of music, parallel to such genres as blues, classical, jazz, punk, and hip-hop. Bands such as Showbread and Antestor believe that the instrumentation of the music is simply a medium of art, while the person creating the music {{as well as the}} lyrics being presented provide the message. Therefore, Christian metal is created when Christians compose metal music in a way that reflects their faith in Christ.|$|E

5|$|Further {{purification}} {{is done by}} {{a chemical}} transport reaction developed by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer. In a closed vessel, the metal reacts with iodine at temperatures above 500°C forming metal(IV) iodide; at a tungsten filament of nearly 2000°C the reverse reaction happens and the iodine <b>and</b> <b>metal</b> are set free. The metal forms a solid coating on the tungsten filament and the iodine can react with additional metal resulting in a steady turnover.|$|E
