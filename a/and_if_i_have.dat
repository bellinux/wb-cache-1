500|$|... {{having been}} made without argument, {{and by a}} {{majority}} only of the court, I hope {{that it is not}} an improper course to bring the subject again in review for a more solemn decision, as it {{is not a question of}} mere ordinary import, but vitally affects the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States; a jurisdiction which they cannot lawfully enlarge or diminish. I shall submit, with the utmost cheerfulness, to the judgment of my brethren, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> hazarded a rash opinion, I have the consolation to know, that their superior learning and ability will save the public from an injury by my error.|$|E
500|$|In 1917, the Bolsheviks rose {{to power}} in Russia in the October Revolution. After over two years of fragile independence, Armenia fell to Soviet rule in late 1920. Georgia was also Sovietized {{by the spring of}} 1921. Both {{countries}} formally became part of the Soviet Union in December 1922. Khachaturian later wrote that [...] "the October Revolution fundamentally changed my whole life <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> really grown into a serious artist, then I am indebted only to the people and the Soviet Government. To this people is dedicated my entire conscious life, as is all my creative work." [...] Khachaturian always remained enthusiastic about communism, and was an atheist. When asked about his visit to the Vatican, Khachaturian responded: [...] "I'm an atheist, but I'm a son of the [...] people who were the first to officially adopt Christianity and thus visiting the Vatican was my duty." ...|$|E

2500|$|Just before Gwyn was hanged {{he turned}} to the crowd and said, [...] "I have been a jesting fellow, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{offended}} any that way, or by my songs, I beseech them for God's sake to forgive me." [...] The hangman pulled on his leg irons hoping to put him out of his pain. When he appeared dead they cut him down, but he revived and remained conscious through the disembowelling, until his head was severed. His last words, in Welsh, were reportedly [...] "" [...] ("Jesus, have mercy on me").|$|E
2500|$|When {{questioned}} on Midweek Politics {{about whether}} reporting on celebrities' sexual orientation incites homophobia {{by making it}} news, Hilton indicated {{that he did not}} believe so. He said that coming out in Hollywood is not necessarily a bad thing, citing Ellen DeGeneres and Rosie O'Donnell as examples: [...] "I know there is some controversy about outing people, but I also believe the only way we're gonna have change is with visibility. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to drag some people screaming out of the closet, then I will. I think that lots of celebrities have an archaic fear that being gay will hurt their career but look at Rosie. Look at Ellen." ...|$|E

If Naser has to answer to someone, I'm right here and I'm not running away from responsibility, I'm not running away from the court, I'm not running away from the Hague or anyone. You just have to call on me and no problem." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I assure you, madam!' said Mr Dombey, 'I {{have laid}} no {{commands}} on Florence; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had,</b> {{there are no}} commands like your wish.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Indeed we {{were doing}} nothing of the kind," [...] Cummings said angrily.

6000|$|... "It seems all confused," [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "I don't even {{remember}} going out of the house.
