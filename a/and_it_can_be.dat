The P90's barrel is cold hammer-forged and chrome-lined, with an overall length of 263mm (10.4in). The barrel has eight rifling grooves with a right-hand twist rate of 1:231mm (1:9.1in), and it {{is equipped with a}} diagonally cut flash suppressor that also acts as a recoil compensator. The stated service life of the barrel is 20,000 rounds.|$|E

5|$|There {{have not}} been any {{controlled}} studies on meth mouth, and several of its aspects are unclear.

5|$|However, {{there is}} {{a fine line between}} {{aggressiveness}} and over-aggressiveness at takeoff. One of the most common mistakes made by athletes, including those at world class level, is to raise the ski tips too much during the transition. This excessive angle of attack causes the skis to act more as a spoiler than an efficient aerodynamic device, resulting in more height than distance; a flight curve that is too steep or shallow is unfavourable. In a well-executed jump, athletes will spend several seconds longer in the air than in ski jumping – up to five seconds more – which requires a different level of skill in order to sustain flight for a longer period, and showcases how the role of aerodynamics is magnified in ski flying. Not all athletes who excel in ski jumping are able do so in ski flying (see the section on specialists), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> difficult for them to hone their skills in the latter due to the hills being off-limits when competitions are not staged.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius blennius (commonly {{known as}} the Slimy Milkcap or Beech Milkcap) is a {{medium-sized}} mushroom of the genus Lactarius found commonly in beech forests in Europe, where it is mycorrhizal, favouring the European Beech (though associations with other trees are known). It was first described by Elias Magnus Fries. Though its colour and size vary, it is distinctive because it is slimy when wet and exudes copious amounts of milk. It {{has been the subject}} of some chemical research, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to produce pigments and blennins. Blennins, some of which have shown potential medical application, are derived from lactarane, a chemical so named because of their association with Lactarius. The edibility of L.blennius is uncertain, with different mycologists suggesting that it is edible (though not recommended), inedible or even poisonous.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{attended}} Isidore Newman School in New Orleans, Louisiana, and led their {{football team}} to a 34–5 record during his three seasons as the starter. He was named Gatorade Circle of Champions National Player-of-the-Year and Columbus (Ohio) Touchdown Club National Offensive Player-of-the-Year in 1993. While at Newman, he began wearing the #18 jersey {{in honor of his}} older brother Cooper, who was forced to give up football due to spinal stenosis. Younger brother Eli also wore the number when he became starting quarterback. Newman has since retired the #18 jersey <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen hanging in the school gym. Manning was among the most sought after high school players in the country and was recruited by about 60 colleges, led by Florida, Florida State, LSU, Michigan, Tennessee, Texas, Texas A, and his father's alma mater, Ole Miss.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{control of}} Texas was {{followed}} by Mexican control of Texas, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> difficult to separate the Spanish and Mexican influences on the future state. The most obvious legacy {{is that of the}} language; the state's name comes from the Spanish rendering of an Indian word. Every major river in modern Texas, except the Red River, has a Spanish or Anglicized name, as do 42 of the state's 254 counties and numerous towns also bear Spanish names. Even many of the words that have been incorporated into American English, such as barbecue, canyon, ranch, and plaza, come from Spanish words. An additional obvious legacy is that of Roman Catholicism. At the end of Spain's reign over Texas, virtually all inhabitants practiced the Catholic religion, and it is still practiced in Texas by a large number of people. The Spanish missions built in San Antonio to convert Indians to Catholicism have been restored and are a National Historic Landmark.|$|E

5|$|The Illinois Freedom Bell {{is located}} in Mount Morris, Illinois, United States, and is the {{official}} freedom bell of the U.S. state of Illinois. The bell was created for a church in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin as {{a replica of the}} Liberty Bell in 1862. In 1910, while it was being moved across the frozen Geneva Lake following a fire at the church, the ice cracked and the bell sank {{to the bottom of the}} lake. It was salvaged in 1960 and the village of Mount Morris acquired it in 1966. The Illinois Freedom Bell is rung during the annual Let Freedom Ring festival, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found beneath a gazebo on the village square. The bell has been credited with starting an Independence Day bell-ringing tradition across the United States. The bell was designated the official Illinois Freedom Bell in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The P90 was {{originally}} {{equipped with the}} Ring Sights HC-14-62 reflex sight, but the current weapon is instead fitted with the Ring Sights MC-10-80 sight, which was specifically designed for it. The HC-14-62 has a polymer housing and uses a forward-aimed fiber optic collector to illuminate the white daytime reticle, which consists of a large circle of about 180 minutes of arc (MOA), with a 20 MOA circle surrounding a 3.5 MOA dot in the center. The MC-10-80 has an anodized aluminium housing, and has a similar black reticle. The night reticle for both the HC-14-62 and the MC-10-80 consists of an open T that is primarily illuminated by a tritium module, and, in the HC-14-62, ambient light drawn in by an upward-facing collector. The sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{used in conjunction with}} night vision equipment. As backup in case the reflex sight is damaged, a set of fixed iron sights is provided {{on each side of the}} reflex sight housing.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the modern Finnhorse were important throughout Finnish history, used as work horses and beasts of burden {{in every aspect of}} life from antiquity well into the 20thcentury. The modern breed's precise line of descent is unclear, but numerous outside influences have been recorded throughout the history of Finland. Linguistics suggest that horse has been in use in Finland in the bronze age, but the earliest archaeological evidence of horses existing in what today is Finland dates to the Finnish Middle Iron Age(400-800CE). The Finnhorse and its progenitors later became an indispensable asset for military forces from the region of Finland during the times of Swedish and Russian rule, and since independence as well. In addition to functionality as military and working horses, the Finnhorse has also been bred for speed in harness racing, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> argued that this sport was the main factor in the survival of the breed after its numbers crashed during the later half of the 20thcentury, from approximately 400,000 animals in the 1950s to 14,000 in the 1980s. In the 21st century, the numbers of the breed have stabilised at approximately 20,000 animals.|$|E
