50|$|A fire {{proximity}} suit (also, silvers, silver bunker suit, or <b>asbestos</b> <b>suit)</b> is a suit {{designed to}} protect a firefighter from high temperatures, especially near fires of extreme temperature such as aircraft fires. They were first designed and used in the 1930s. Originally made of asbestos fabric, current models use vacuum-deposited aluminized materials.|$|E
50|$|Heat Wave {{carries a}} hand held {{flamethrower}} {{that allows him}} to project a concentrated stream of fire at opponents. He wears an <b>asbestos</b> <b>suit</b> with a breathing mask that affords him protection against fire and heat. His suit was once shown to be able to project heat as well, staving off an attack from Captain Cold's cold gun. Heat Wave has a pipe attached to his left arm that can project a fire retardant which allows him to put out fires.|$|E
50|$|The foundry {{initially}} used a {{crucible steel}} melting process. Scrap steel metal was melted in crucibles in oil furnaces. The furnace {{was lined with}} fire brick and had a steel cover which was removed for a melter to take a crucible with molten steel from the furnace. The melter was protected by an <b>asbestos</b> <b>suit</b> and gloves as he had to stand right over the intense heat to carefully grab the crucibles with tongs without breaking them. With several employees the two brothers handled the melting and molding. Many a night Walther slept in a hammock in the foundry because he couldn’t leave the work.|$|E
50|$|Suits against ship {{owners were}} a novel legal development. Most of the <b>asbestos</b> <b>suits</b> in Newport News had {{previously}} been brought against parts makers. Shipyards have immunity from <b>asbestos</b> <b>suits</b> under worker's compensation laws. Exxon said the shipyard was solely responsible {{for the safety of}} its workers {{and that there was no}} proof on its ships. Minton lawyers said Exxon new about health risks from asbestos in the 1930s and created rules to protect its own workers but did nothing to warn shipyard workers.|$|R
40|$|When court trials (or arbitration) are the {{mechanisms}} for resolving bargaining impasses, {{the costs and}} risks associated with third-party intervention should motivate settlement (Henry Farber and Harry Katz, 1979). However, empirical evidence suggests that impasses and inefficient settlements are common {{in the legal system}} and in contract negotiations. For example, one study of <b>asbestos</b> <b>suits</b> found that only 37 cents of every dollar spent by both sides end up in the plaintiffs' hands (James Kakalik et al., 1983) ...|$|R

Thanks for every design review. “Be anxious about nothing, {{but in all}} things, with prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, make your request known to God, and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. ” Philippians 4 : 6 - 8 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS First and foremost, I want to thank Lori Clarke and George Avrunin for holding me to {{exacting}} standards for all these years: this work is as much their achievement as it is mine, and I will undoubtedly apply the lessons they taught me about critical thinking and perseverance to many other projects in the future. I think I have finally learned how to put my <b>asbestos</b> <b>suit</b> on! I also want to thank Beth Henneman for her expertise in blood transfusion and patient identification, her attention to detail, her enthusiasm, her encouragement, {{and the way she}} infused a sense of fun into everything! She patiently taught me how to ask the right questions, and she provided an invaluable perspective that added a good dash of practice to my theories.

5000|$|As of 2005, about 10% of {{asbestos}} claims {{were based on}} malignancies. Most suits and trust claims allege either mild asbestosis or pleural plaques and claim not lung injury. Most of these claims are made based on x-ray screenings. Nearly all suits and claims with a non-malignant basis are generated by asbestos screening companies. These firms are generally closely connected to trial lawyers and run by entrepreneurs {{with little or no}} medical training. Screening companies tend to target current and former industrial and construction workers. Screening companies often do their work en masse and make use of vans and trailers equipped with x-ray machines. Pulmonary screening is also often conducted. Roughly 90% of <b>asbestos</b> <b>suits</b> and trust claims originate with screening firms. From 1990 to 2005 750,000 to 1,000,000 people were screened in a massive effort to recruit litigants for plaintiffs attorneys. Most plaintiffs show absolutely no symptoms associated with asbestos exposure. Plaintiffs attorneys pay [...] "B-readers" [...] to make [...] "diagnoses" [...] that can serve as the basis of litigation or trust claims. The pulmonary tests conducted generally violate the standards set by the American Thoracic Society.|$|R
50|$|After {{graduating from}} Patterson Park High School, Angelos {{attended}} the University of Baltimore, where {{he earned a}} bachelor's degree. He then attended law school at night at the University of Baltimore School of Law, studying so conscientiously that he was named class valedictorian. Angelos passed the bar in 1961 and opened an office specializing in handling product-liability cases for employees, almost always on a contingency basis. In {{one of his most}} celebrated cases, he represented some 8,700 steelworkers, shipyard workers, and manufacturers' employees in a consolidated-action <b>asbestos</b> poisoning <b>suit</b> that was partially settled in 1992. Angelos' take from that litigation alone has been estimated at $330 million.|$|R
5000|$|During May 1962, her air {{group was}} dis-embarked {{as she entered}} a short {{maintenance}} period in Portsmouth Dockyard. 807 squadron was disbanded at this time, following a decision to phase out the Scimitar in favour of the Blackburn Buccaneer. Centaur lacked the capacity to operate the Buccaneer, however {{the removal of the}} Scimitar Squadron did enable her to operate an enlarged squadron of twelve Sea Vixens instead. [...] On the 18th June 1962, a new commanding officer, Captain Philip G Sharp, took over the ship, before she sailed to take part in exercises in the North Sea, following which she departed for Gibraltar. The rest of the summer was spent in the Mediterranean, including a three-week refit in Gibraltar, before she returned to home waters in October. On 19 November, whilst exercising in the Irish Sea, there was a sudden loss of pressure in [...] "A" [...] Boiler Room, which in turn led to a loss of power on the port engine and tripped lighting and radar circuits. This was caused by the burst of a main steam-pipe in the boiler room and superheated steam at 700 F and at a pressure of up to [...] escaping and killing, instantly, the five crew members on duty at the time in the boiler room. Engineering staff isolated the affected boiler and later that morning a rescue team wearing <b>asbestos</b> <b>suits,</b> were able to recover the bodies of their ship-mates. Later that day their coffins, wrapped in Union Jacks were flown off to RAF Valley and a memorial service was held. Centaur returned to Portsmouth 27 November for repairs that lasted until 22 January.|$|R
50|$|Fiberboard was an {{asbestos}} supplier near bankruptcy that {{attempted to}} negotiate a global settlement of the claims against it. The proposed settlement would have relied almost entirely on insurance claims. Before the settlement Fiberboard had unpaid debts of at least $1 billion and was facing about 50,000 <b>asbestos</b> injury <b>suits.</b> Fiberboard {{did not have enough}} cash ready to enter the Georgine settlement but decided to pursue the same type of arrangement on its own. Fiberboard first negotiated an inventory settlement with Ness Motley covering 20,000 asbestos claims. This arrangement was later extended to 45,000 claims. Shockingly, the terms of the settlement required Ness Motley to recommend the same terms to any future claimants it might represent. A judge then appointed Ness Motley to negotiate on behalf of future claimants.|$|R
40|$|The Effect of Joint and Several Liability on the Bankruptcy Rate of Defendants: Evidence from Asbestos Litigation - Under the {{doctrine}} of joint and several liability, if two defendants jointly share a liability and the first becomes insolvent, his unpaid liabilities may be reallocated to the second, solvent defendant. While the second defendant's assets may be sufficient to cover his own share of the liability, they may be insufficient to also cover the first defendant's unpaid liability. As a result the first defendant's insolvency may trigger the second defendant's insolvency (White 2002, Cupp 2003). The {{purpose of this paper}} is to quantify the pressure that one defendant's bankruptcy places on the solvency of co-defendants in the context of mass torts subject to joint and several liability. The specific tort we examine is asbestos poisoning. We choose this example because of the large number of companies [...] over 61 since 1982 (Stiglitz et al. 2003) [...] that have gone bankrupt due to asbestos litigation and the even larger number of companies [...] perhaps as many as 8, 000 (Brickman 2004) [...] that have been named as defendants in <b>asbestos</b> <b>suits.</b> Using 10 -K data from a number of large asbestos defendants and a data set of all judgments in asbestos trials, we estimate that the mean per-claim payments by major defendants grew an additional 5 to 10 percent annually or 56 to 157 percent altogether between 1990 and 2002 due to the bankruptcy of jointly liable defendants during this period. To put it another way, if no companies had gone bankrupt between 1990 and 2002, the asbestos liabilities of solvent defendants might have been less than two-fifths their present size. This result is also a contribution to the literature on bankruptcy and on mass torts. First, numerous scholars have suggested tort claimants ought to be given superpriority in bankruptcy to reduce their exposure to the risk of a defendant's insolvency. We demonstrate that, with joint and several liabilities, this risk is actually reallocated to jointly liable but solvent defendants. Tort superpriority would reallocate some of this risk to other creditors, which seems neither fair nor efficient. Second, in the debate over how to compensate victims of mass tort [...] case-by-case litigation, class actions, valuation in bankruptcy, or legislative trust [...] one criticism of piecemeal litigation has been that it leaves the plaintiff bearing the risk of defendant insolvency. Our findings provide evidence otherwise in the case of joint and several liabilities...|$|R
