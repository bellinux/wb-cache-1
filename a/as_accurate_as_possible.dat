25|$|Daniel Jackson's {{lecture on}} his {{theories}} was filmed {{in a hotel}} in Los Angeles. The scene was originally much longer and delved more into the theories that aliens had built the Egyptian pyramids, but the scene was trimmed for time concerns for the release. The scenes with O'Neil at his house were the first scenes filmed with Kurt Russell; his hair was cut short afterwards. Russell requested his hair color to be brightened a little for the film. The fictional facility housing the Stargate was the largest set for the film, located in Long Beach, California. Egyptologist Stuart Tyson Smith joined production to make all Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and spoken language <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|E

Jonas consulted with paleontologists Barnum Brown, Edwin H. Colbert and John Ostrom in order to create nine sculptures that were <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> After the Fair closed, the dinosaur models toured the country on flatbed trailers as part of a company advertising campaign. Most of the statues are now on display at various museums and parks.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, screenwriter Sarah Williams {{approached}} Douglas Rae and Robert Bernstein of Ecosse Films {{with the}} intention of creating a film about the life of Jane Austen, a popular eighteenth century English novelist. Williams had recently read Becoming Jane Austen, a 2003 biography that largely pieced together several known facts, such as Austen's meeting Tom Lefroy on Christmas 1795, into a coherent story about unrequited love. Bernstein agreed to adapt the work, believing that it depicted [...] "a pivotal relationship in Jane Austen's early life that was largely unknown to the public." [...] The book's author, Jon Hunter Spence, was hired as a historical consultant on the film, with the task of [...] "see that, given that the 'story' is a work of imagination, the factual material was <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> within the limitations of the story." ...|$|E

500|$|Determined to {{make her}} novels <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> Heyer {{collected}} reference works and research materials to use while writing. At {{the time of her}} death she owned over 1,000 historical reference books, including Debrett's and an 1808 dictionary of the House of Lords. In addition to the standard historical works about the medieval and eighteenth-century periods, her library included histories of snuff boxes, sign posts, and costumes. She often clipped illustrations from magazine articles and jotted down interesting vocabulary or facts onto note cards, but rarely recorded where she found the information. Her notes were sorted into categories, such as Beauty, Colours, Dress, Hats, Household, Prices, and Shops; and even included details such as the cost of candles in a particular year. Other notebooks contained lists of phrases, covering such topics as [...] "Food and Crockery", [...] "Endearments", and [...] "Forms of Address." [...] One of her publishers, Max Reinhardt, once attempted to offer editorial suggestions about the language in one of her books but was promptly informed by a member of his staff that no one in England knew more about Regency language than Heyer.|$|E
500|$|The {{comic book}} series was {{announced}} at the 2009 Comic-Con International, and was scheduled to debut in October 2009, but its launch was delayed to coincide with that of God of War III. Scott A. Steinberg, Vice President of Product Marketing at SCEA said, [...] "we are thrilled {{to work with the}} world's largest comic book publisher to bring one of our most beloved PlayStation franchises...to comic book fans." [...] In an interview with IGN, the series writer Marv Wolfman stated that when he heard a rumor of the series, he [...] "put [...] name right away and kept pushing" [...] to be chosen as the writer because God of War is one of his favorite video games. Wolfman said that he had already played the first two games, so there was no research to be done and [...] "it's because [...] loved the game that [...] wanted to do the comic." [...] He received copies of the scripts for all the games to ensure his work was <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> and stated that he worked very closely with Sony Santa Monica—the developer of the video games—and tied the comic book's narrative directly to the story they created for the games. Wolfman said that Santa Monica ensured the mythology was consistent while revealing new facts about Kratos' past.|$|E

2500|$|Theoretical {{physicist}} Kip Thorne was {{a scientific}} {{consultant for the}} film to ensure the depictions of wormholes and relativity were <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> [...] "For the depictions of the wormholes and the black hole," [...] he said, [...] "we discussed {{how to go about}} it, and then I worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black hole—so what you see is based on Einstein's general relativity equations." ...|$|E

Hammond said that, while his initial Connery {{impression}} was <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> it would eventually morph into a [...] "bastardization" [...] of the actor, which audiences—and Hammond himself—found far more entertaining. Though Trebek shaved his trademark mustache in 2001, Ferrell retained {{it as long}} as he played the character, even in the twelfth sketch—Ferrell's last episode as a cast member—when a clean-shaven real Trebek made a cameo at the end.|$|E
2500|$|Gill's {{account of}} the battle between HMAS Sydney and the German {{auxiliary}} cruiser Kormoran in November 1941 has been criticised by some authors who view it as being part of an official cover-up. Gill, however, reached his conclusions independently and without censorship and his {{account of the}} battle is generally considered to have been <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> given that little evidence was available on the events which led to Sydney being sunk with the loss of her entire crew. Nevertheless, naval historian and Anglican Bishop to the Australian Defence Force Tom Frame has argued that while Gill [...] "was a man of integrity" [...] and not influenced by the Navy, {{his account of the}} battle is [...] "bad history" [...] as it is contradictory and [...] "went beyond the reliable and corroborated evidence which was available to him".|$|E

2500|$|While {{researching the}} castles, Tranter {{realised}} {{that there were}} many characters and incidents in Scottish history which could be used as the basis for novels, which he tried to make <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> – while making no effort to hide his own strong Scottish identity. The Queen's Grace (1953) was his first novel to focus on an historical character (in this case, Mary, Queen of Scots), although it contained a high fictional content. [...] Two trilogies followed: the MacGregor Trilogy (1957–1962) and the Master of Gray Trilogy (1961–1965). [...] By this time, Tranter was well established as a writer of serious historical fiction. [...] The fictional content decreased as he became more experienced, and his later novels were almost entirely composed around the historical record. These novels have gained a wide readership while providing a basic grounding in Scottish history to their readers.|$|E

Regarding the personal experiences of his heroes he would add that nearly every incident cited has been taken from life, as narrated by those who joined in the frenzied rush to the new gold fields.|$|E
