50|$|Geneon Universal Entertainment {{had signed}} an {{agreement}} with Toei to license an English-dubbed version of the anime in the United States and Canada. It was also announced that the series would air on the Canadian cable channel Razer, though it never earned a timeslot and was cancelled before broadcast. Ultimately only three DVDs of <b>Air</b> <b>Master</b> were released in North America, with the fourth and fifth being solicited but cancelled due to an abrupt termination of partnership between the two companies. Region 1 DVDs for the anime, along with two other Toei titles, received very little advertising and suffered from poor quality, resulting in dismal sales and a large number of returns to Geneon. In 2009, Funimation gained the rights to <b>Air</b> <b>Master</b> and began streaming it on the company's official website. The anime was also streamed on Joost.|$|E
