However, the reconstruction of such networks remains an arduous process requiring a high level of human intervention. This process is further complicated by occurrences of missing or conflicting information and the absence of common annotation standards between different data sources. Results In this article, we report a semi-automated methodology aimed at <b>streamlining</b> the <b>process</b> of metabolic network reconstruction by enabling the integration of different genome-wide databases of metabolic reactions. We present results obtained by applying this methodology to the metabolic network of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. A systematic comparison of compounds and reactions between two genome-wide databases allowed us to obtain a high-quality core consensus reconstruction, which was validated for stoichiometric consistency. A lower level of consensus led to a larger reconstruction, which has a lower quality standard but provides a baseline for further manual curation.

40|$|Role-Based Access Control models (RBACs) – {{and their}} {{extensions}} – are currently {{considered the most}} effective approach for engineering access control in complex infor-mation systems and dynamic organisations. In this paper we consider their application {{in the context of}} Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) – in particular for models and infrastructures supporting role-based organisation models – by means of the notion of Agent Coordination Context (ACC). Here the ACC is used as organisation abstraction released by the MAS infrastructure, defining the runtime context of an agent in terms of its actions/perceptions, according to the roles it is playing inside an organisation. In the paper, we discuss how the ACC abstraction has been used in TuCSoN coordination infrastructure to implement an RBAC-like model, making it possible <b>to</b> dynamically specify <b>and</b> enact articulated role policies, including also interaction protocols. RBAC-like models for MAS In contexts such as information systems, Role-Base Access Control (RBACs) models are currently considered {{the most effective way to}} engineer security for complex organisations (Ferraiolo & Kuhn 1992; Sandhu et al. 1996).

This program annual report describes the activities undertaken during the calender past year, and activities planned in future years to implement the Chemical Management Program, one of six programs that supports environmental management at SNL/CA. SNL/CA is responsible for tracking chemicals (chemical and biological materials), providing Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and for regulatory compliance reporting according to a variety of chemical regulations. The principal regulations for chemical tracking are the Emergency Planning Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) and the California Right-to-Know regulations. The regulations, the Hazard Communication/Lab Standard of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) are also key to the CM Program.

40|$|Supply {{networks}} crossing organizational boundaries {{become more}} and more critical for success in the dynamics of supply relationships. The ability to quickly find, connect and qualify business partners as sources of supply on a regional, national and international basis, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> sustain those relationships crossing intercultural barriers along the completion of business cases, is and will remain a key competitive differentiator in the global economy. Supply networks in particular are characterized by wide inter-organizational settings of connected entities, with the key focus on supply management and procurement in the provision of goods and services. As such, they describe the value generation flow between connected business partners. Supporting supply networks on an individual company level, the primary target of enterprise resource planning systems is to standardize structured data <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>streamline</b> business <b>processes</b> within a company. Extending this scope, e-procurement and supplier-relationship management systems focus on supply networks beyond the boundary of a single company. They enable integration across companies by establishing standards for document exchange between different systems. However, these approaches still result in costly, rigid, and complex data and process integration of peer-to-peer nodes in dynamic supply networks. Also, the emergence of e-marketplaces in the early 2000 s could not overcome these challenges, and many of the most promising e-marketplace providers and concepts disappeared when the. com-bubble burst – primarily because of the data and process integration complexity that arises when connecting dyadic and many-to-many network relationships on a single platform. Besides this integration challenge, e-procurement and supplier-relationship management systems are targeted on <b>streamlining</b> structured business <b>processes</b> and handling of structured data. Structured data and processes have fixed coded meaning, format and sequence - from start to completion of a business transaction. Structured data is normally stored in database fields, and structured processes follow pre-defined patterns of transactional steps to complete standardized business cases. The coverage of structure data and processes is mostly sufficient where the use case is commonly defined and accepted by the involved business partners, composed mostly of routine steps and not requiring much direct human interaction. To cope with the increasing challenges in the highly collaborative, inter-organizational settings <b>and</b> <b>to</b> leverage Web 2. 0 and Enterprise 2. 0 capabilities in supply networks, the support of unstructured interactions become more important. Unlike structured data and processes, unstructured interactions like instant messages, feeds, or blogs have no or limited fixed format, are directly derived from human interactions resulting in textual data, and can hardly be computed without any prior transformation. Many of these happen before, during, and after the actual execution of structured business processes, but are rarely supported by the corresponding supply management systems. This is a particular challenge, as Cappuccio (2012) predicts that enterprise data will grow by 650...|$|R
40|$|As the new {{control system}} of the Mercator Telescope is being finalized, we can review some {{technologies}} and design methodologies that are advantageous, despite their relative uncommonness in astronomical instrumentation. Particular for the Mercator Telescope {{is that it is}} controlled by a single high-end soft-PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). Using off-the-shelf components only, our distributed embedded system controls all subsystems of the telescope such as the pneumatic primary mirror support, the hydrostatic bearing, the telescope axes, the dome, the safety system, and so on. We show how real-time application logic can be written conveniently in typical PLC languages (IEC 61131 - 3) <b>and</b> in C++ (<b>to</b> implement the pointing kernel) using the commercial TwinCAT 3 programming environment. This software processes the inputs and outputs of the distributed system in real-time via an observatory-wide EtherCAT network, which is synchronized with high precision to an IEEE 1588 (PTP, Precision Time Protocol) time reference clock. Taking full advantage of the ability of soft-PLCs to run both real-time and non real-time software, the same device also hosts the most important user interfaces (HMIs or Human Machine Interfaces) and communication servers (OPC UA for process data, FTP for XML configuration data, and VNC for remote control). To manage the complexity of the system <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>streamline</b> the development <b>process,</b> we show how most of the software, electronics and systems engineering aspects of the control system have been modeled as a set of scripts written in a Domain Specific Language (DSL).

Overall, these proposals respond well to the majority of recommendations set out by the Australian Chief Scientist in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) : Australia’s Future, and have the potential <b>to</b> provide significant <b>and</b> lasting benefit <b>to</b> Australia through a comprehensive approach to Australian STEM over the coming decade. This submission from the Academy provides both a high- level summary and a detailed response to the consultation questions on each of the components of the proposed strategy: 1) Australian competitiveness; 2) education and training; 3) research; and 4) international engagement. The submission makes 20 specific recommendations, four of which relate to measures proposed in the consultation document that are not recommended by the Academy, <b>and</b> 16 relating <b>to</b> additional measures that would provide additional value if included in the strategy. Two overarching recommendations of this submission are: 1. That the final national STEM strategy must be implemented {{in such a way as}} to achieve a true whole- of-government framework <b>and</b> approach <b>to</b> STEM in Australia. The Commonwealth Science Council is the clear governing body to oversee the strategy and the myriad programs, initiatives and other strategies that will come under or otherwise relate to it; likely with a limited number of additional subordinate governance mechanisms such as a National Advisory Board for international science required. However, numerous and significant changes and transformations will be required at the point of delivery of new <b>and</b> existing programs <b>to</b> <b>streamline</b> <b>processes</b> <b>and</b> ensure efficient and enabling interaction with the scientists, business people, students, teachers, government representatives and members of the public who engage with them. 2. That the final national STEM strategy include clear mechanisms <b>to</b> increase public <b>and</b> private funding for STEM. Business investment in R&D in Australia sits well below the OECD average, while Commonwealth Government funding for science as a percentage of GDP has been trending down for the past thirty years, and declining in real terms from a peak of $ 9. 8 billion in 2012. While the STEM strategy presents a significant opportunity <b>to</b> better coordinate <b>and</b> target existing resources, the long-term objectives of the strategy will not be realised or sustained without mechanisms to steadily increase public and private investment in science–particularly in basic research–over the coming years...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{commercial}} airframes exceeding {{twenty years of}} service continues to grow. A typical aircraft can experience over 2, 000 fatigue cycles (cabin pressurizations) and even greater flight hours in a single year. An unavoidable by-product of aircraft use is that crack and corrosion flaws develop throughout the aircraft's skin and substructure elements. Economic barriers to the purchase of new aircraft have created an aging aircraft fleet and placed even greater demands on efficient and safe repair methods. The use of bonded composite doublers offers the airframe manufacturers and aircraft maintenance facilities a cost effective method to safety extend {{the lives of their}} aircraft. Instead of riveting multiple steel or aluminum plates to facilitate an aircraft repair, it is now possible to bond a single Boron-Epoxy composite doubler to the damaged structure. The FAA's Airworthiness Assurance Center at Sandia National Labs (AANC) is conducting a program with Boeing <b>and</b> Federal Express <b>to</b> validate <b>and</b> introduce composite doubler repair technology to the US commercial aircraft industry. This project focuses on repair of DC- 10 structure and builds on the foundation of the successful L- 1011 door corner repair that was completed by the AANC, Lockheed-Martin, and Delta Air Lines. The L- 1011 composite doubler repair was installed in 1997 and has not developed any flaws in over three years of service, As a follow-on effort, this DC- 1 O repair program investigated design, analysis, performance (durability, flaw containment, reliability), installation, and nondestructive inspection issues. Current activities are demonstrating regular use of composite doubler repairs on commercial aircraft. The primary goal of this program is to move the technology into niche applications <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>streamline</b> the design-to-installation <b>process.</b> Using the data accumulated to date, the team has designed, analyzed, and developed inspection techniques for an array of composite doubler repairs with high-use fuselage skin applications. The general DC- 10 repair areas which provide a high payoff <b>to</b> FedEx <b>and</b> which minimize design and installation complexities have been identified as follows: (1) gouges, dents, lightning strike, and impact skin damage, and (2) corrosion grind outs in surface skin. This paper presents the engineering activities that have been completed in order to make this technology available for widespread commercial aircraft use...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND A realist {{synthesis}} {{attempts to}} provide policy makers with a transferable theory that suggests a certain program {{is more or}} less likely to work in certain respects, for particular subjects, in specific kinds of situations. Yet realist reviews can require considerable and sustained investment over time, which does not always suit the time-sensitive demands of many policy decisions. ‘Rapid Realist Review’ methodology (RRR) has been developed as a tool for applying a realist approach to a knowledge synthesis process in order to produce a product that is useful to policy makers in responding to time-sensitive and/or emerging issues, while preserving the core elements of realist methodology. METHODS Using examples from completed RRRs, we describe key features of the RRR methodology, the resources required, and the strengths and limitations of the process. All aspects of an RRR are guided by both a local reference group, and a group of content experts. Involvement of knowledge users and external experts ensures both the usability of the review products, as well as their links to current practice. RESULTS RRRs have proven useful in providing evidence for and making explicit what is known on a given topic, as well as articulating where knowledge gaps may exist. From the RRRs completed to date, findings broadly adhere to four (often overlapping) classifications: guiding rules for policy-making; knowledge quantification (i. e., the amount of literature available that identifies context, mechanisms, and outcomes for a given topic); understanding tensions/paradoxes in the evidence base; and, reinforcing or refuting beliefs and decisions taken. CONCLUSIONS ‘Traditional’ realist reviews and RRRs have some key differences, which allow policy makers to apply each type of methodology strategically to maximize its utility within a particular local constellation of history, goals, resources, politics and environment. In particular, the RRR methodology is explicitly designed to engage knowledge users <b>and</b> review stakeholders <b>to</b> define the research questions, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>streamline</b> the review <b>process.</b> In addition, results are presented with a focus on context-specific explanations for what works within a particular set of parameters rather than producing explanations that are potentially transferrable across contexts and populations. For policy makers faced with making difficult decisions in short time frames for which there is sufficient (if limited) published/research and practice-based evidence available, RRR provides a practical, outcomes-focused knowledge synthesis method.
