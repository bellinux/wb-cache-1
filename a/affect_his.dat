The NBO was never itself {{accepted}} as an accrediting entity by {{organizations such as}} the American Board of Medical Specialties, and its certification was considered invalid by many hospitals and insurance companies.

In July, {{he was called}} {{to testify before the}} United States House of Representatives' Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) concerning statements made that April by black athlete and actor Paul Robeson. Robinson was reluctant to testify, but he eventually agreed to do so, fearing it might negatively <b>affect</b> <b>his</b> career if he declined.|$|E
5|$|After Lord's, however, {{his form}} tailed away considerably: tormented by Australia's seam-bowling attack, his {{scores for the}} rest of the series were 13, 0 and 4, and 24 and 1, {{bringing}} his batting average for the five-match series down to 27.78. Collingwood's difficulties with the bat seemed to <b>affect</b> <b>his</b> usually high-class catching, and he dropped three chances of varying degrees of difficulty on the final day of the series at the Oval, though he did take a sharp catch to dismiss Mitchell Johnson for a duck off Steve Harmison as part of England's surge to a 197-run victory in the match, and a 2â€“1 victory in the series.|$|E

5|$|Chapman took up pipe smoking aged 15, which {{continued}} {{for the remainder}} of his life. He began drinking heavily during his time at Cambridge and St Bartholomew's, favouring gin. By the time Monty Python went on tour in 1973, Chapman's drinking had begun to <b>affect</b> <b>his</b> performance, causing him to miss cues to go on stage. He stopped drinking in Christmas 1977, concerned at being able to act in Life of Brian successfully, and remained sober {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|He {{was never}} booked or sent off {{throughout}} his entire career, and teammate Jimmy Armfield noted that Matthews would never retaliate {{to the many}} extremely physical challenges opponents would often make to try and take {{him out of the}} game.

5|$|He {{would carry}} the day after federal {{prosecutors}} appealed for an en banc rehearing by the entire court, reiterating that point for an eight-judge majority and saying that unless Jacobson could demonstrate that a specifically protected right had been violated by the investigation, the conviction should stand. The majority also rejected the entrapment defense, arguing that the postal investigators had merely provided Jacobson with opportunities to purchase child pornography and not sought to <b>affect</b> <b>his</b> predisposition (an important element in entrapment under U.S. law) {{to do so in}} any way.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Grant was {{unsuccessful}} in obtaining the Republican presidential nomination {{for a third}} term. Facing severe investment reversals and dying of throat cancer, he wrote his memoirs, which {{proved to be a}} major critical and financial success. His death in 1885 prompted an outpouring in support of national unity. Historical assessments of Grant's legacy have varied considerably over the years. His popular reputation focuses on his drinking, which historians agree did not adversely <b>affect</b> <b>his</b> military campaigns. Early historical evaluations were mostly negative about Grant's presidency. Scholars continue to rank his presidency below the average, but modern appreciation for his support for civil rights has helped improve his standing.|$|E
5|$|In 1979 {{he began}} to {{experience}} hip and leg problems; one of his legs had shortened {{an inch and a}} half and he had to learn to walk again. Although he remained otherwise in good health this was a sign of his increasing age, and the disabilities that came with it began to <b>affect</b> <b>his</b> judgments as well. While speaking at Cumberland Lodge in 1980 he forgot the details of the case, something shocking for a judge noted for his excellent memory.|$|E

5|$|In the {{extended}} edition of The Two Towers, Jackson included an invented flashback scene showing that Denethor had neglected him {{in favour of}} Boromir when sending him to Rivendell, so that Faramir wanted to please his father by bringing him the Ring. (The relationship is similarly strained in the book, but his father's favouritism {{does not seem to}} <b>affect</b> <b>his</b> decisions in Ithilien.) Reviewers have opined that {{the extended}} edition presents Faramir in a more favourable light.|$|E
5|$|Jailhouse Rock is a 1957 American musical drama film {{directed}} by Richard Thorpe and starring Elvis Presley, Judy Tyler, and Mickey Shaughnessy. Distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and dramatized by Guy Trosper from a story written by Nedrick Young, {{the film is}} about a young man sentenced to prison for manslaughter who is mentored in music by his prison cellmate who realizes his musical abilities. After his release from jail, while {{looking for a job}} as a club singer, the young man meets a musical promoter who helps him launch his career.

He retired from the ministry in February 1923, and in March was granted leave of absence because of his deteriorating health. He died aged 63 from chronic nephritis on 14 September 1923 at Caulfield in Melbourne, {{survived by his wife}} and two daughters. Presbyterian services were held at Parliament House in Melbourne and St Stephen's Church in Sydney, and Millen was given a state funeral. He is buried at Rookwood Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|The central item of Oracle of Seasons is the Rod of Seasons. By {{standing}} on a stump and swinging the rod, Link can change the season and <b>affect</b> <b>his</b> surroundings. For example, to cross a body of water, Link can change the season to winter and walk on the ice. Changing the season to summer causes vines to flourish, which Link can use to scale cliffs. When Link obtains the rod, he initially cannot use it. In {{the course of the}} game, Link visits four towers that house the four spirits of the seasons; each tower Link visits allows him to switch to an additional season.|$|E

In October of that year, a Fortune magazine survey to find the nation's favorite movie actor listed Tracy in first place.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he enjoyed}} the posting as drugs adviser, Penfold was keen {{to go back to}} Africa. He applied for a post as high {{commissioner}} in Namibia, but the post was downgraded and the application fell through. Penfold was then offered a posting to Sierra Leone. Although it was a lower-ranking post than the British Virgin Islands, Penfold was assured that taking the position would not adversely <b>affect</b> <b>his</b> career, so he accepted and, in March 1997, was appointed High Commissioner to Sierra Leone. He later stated that he believed his previous experience in Africa, particularly in Uganda, stood him in good stead for the events of his posting to Sierra Leone. The country {{was in the middle of}} a bloody civil war in 1997, and on 25 Mayâ€”six weeks into Penfold's tenureâ€”President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's government was overthrown in a military coup. Although the coup itself did not come as a surprise, the timing caught the international community off-guard. As in Uganda a decade earlier, Penfold gathered all the high commission staff and their families under one roof.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{endured a}} poor {{start to the}} 1971â€“72 season, {{and as a result}} Mee {{purchased}} Alan Ball, Jr. from Everton for Â£220,000. They went on to go 14 games unbeaten over the winter, closing the gap on leaders Manchester City to four points. They were knocked out of the European Cup at the quarter-final stage by eventual winners Ajax. They ended the season in fifth place, and gifted Derby County the league title by denying Liverpool what would have proved to be a decisive victory on the penultimate day of the season. Arsenal returned to Wembley to defend the FA Cup, but lost 1â€“0 to Leeds United; Kennedy had lost his first team place late in the season after fatigue began to <b>affect</b> <b>his</b> form, and was only named as a substitute for the final before he came on for Radford after 73 minutes. Kennedy scored 19 goals in 55 appearances to finish as the club's top goalscorer for the second successive season.|$|E
5|$|Bond's {{drinking}} habits run {{throughout the}} series of books. During the course of On Her Majesty's Secret Service alone, Bond consumes forty-six drinks: Pouilly-FuissÃ©, Riquewihr and Marsala wines, most of a bottle of Algerian wine, some 1953 ChÃ¢teau Mouton Rothschild claret, along with Taittinger and Krug champagnes and Babycham; for whiskies he consumes three bourbon and waters, half a pint of I.W. Harper bourbon, Jack Daniel's whiskey, two double bourbons on the rocks, two whisky and sodas, two neat scotches and one glass of neat whisky; vodka consumption totalled four vodka and tonics and three double vodka martinis; other spirits included two double brandies with ginger ale, a flask of Enzian Schnaps and a double gin: he also washed this down with four steins of German beer. Bond's alcohol intake {{does not seem to}} <b>affect</b> <b>his</b> performance.|$|E
5|$|Cross Days follows Yuuki Ashikaga, a bespectacled young lad whose {{withdrawn}} {{school life}} goes awry when his affection for two girls begins to <b>affect</b> <b>his</b> relationships {{with his friends}} and peers. Though unaware of each other, the girls in question constitute {{the premise of the}} game: Kotonoha Katsura, a character well known throughout the franchise as the pivotal love-interest of Makoto Itou, and Roka Kitsuregawa, a newcomer whose efforts to make Yuuki jealous only serve to further complicate her relationship with him. Chie Ashikaga, the mildly abusive older sister of Yuuki, and Kyouichi Kasannoin, Nanami Kanroji's boyfriend, having only previously made cameo appearances in the School Days anime, return to make more prominent roles, as does Ai Yamagata, a character last seen from Summer Days. Rounding up the set of the cast are Ion Ishibashi and Kira Youka, a couple of friends who also make first appearances in the game.|$|E
