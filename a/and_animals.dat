40|$|Untreated human <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> excreta once being {{released}} into the environment can be a hazard {{to the environment and}} human health by possible pathogens and drug residues. Integrated human <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> manure management faces challenges given that livestock is kept in proximity to human residencies and large amounts of human <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> manure are produced in limited space. Meanwhile the demand of livestock and humans manure reuse in agriculture and fisheries requires that the hygienic safety of both treated human <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> excreta is ensured and their nutrient contents remain high. This research aims to assess the situation of human <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> excreta management based on regulation documents and environmental health impact approaches and to introduce some initial researches on integrated <b>animal</b> <b>and</b> human waste management. Finally, recommendations on human <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> waste management to reuse the excreta safely and effectively are provided...|$|R

5|$|The plants <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> which live on Solsbury Hill {{reflect the}} habitat {{provided}} by grassland overlying the limestone rock beneath. Specialist plants <b>and</b> <b>animals,</b> {{some of which}} are rare species, have adapted to the calcareous grassland. Most of the landscape is largely unaffected by agriculture as shown by the yellow meadow ant. Examples of plant species found include bird's foot trefoil, vetches, greater knapweed, harebells, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and scabious. It is {{one of a series of}} flower-rich habitats, which Avon Wildlife Trust are trying to link together. The plants attract a range of insects including: the six-spotted burnet moth, hummingbird hawk-moth and a number of butterflies including chalkhill blues. A small population of common buzzard (Buteo buteo) nest in the area. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), badger and red fox are also seen. The skylark also nests on the hill.|$|E
