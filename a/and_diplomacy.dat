5|$|Although the French and the Austrians claimed {{victory at}} the time, {{military}} historians generally agree that the Austrians achieved a strategic advantage. However, the French withdrew from the battlefield in good order and several days later crossed the Rhine River at Hüningen. A confusion of politics <b>and</b> <b>diplomacy</b> in Vienna wasted any strategic advantage that Charles might have obtained and locked the Habsburg force into two sieges on the Rhine, when the troops were badly needed in northern Italy. The battle is commemorated on a monument in Vienna and on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.|$|E

They created the Contadora support group, to support the Contadora group from South America. Both groups negotiated together, but ultimately failed because of the reluctance of both Nicaragua and the United States to change their positions. The group changed its scope later to discuss foreign debt <b>and</b> <b>diplomacy</b> with the United Kingdom in relation to the Falklands conflict.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to terraforming, optimizing individual base performance and building secret projects, players may also benefit their factions through social engineering, probe teams, <b>and</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> Social engineering modifies the ideologically based bonuses and penalties {{forced by the}} player's choice of faction. Probe teams can sabotage and steal information, units, technology, and energy from enemy bases, while diplomacy lets the player create coalitions with other factions. It also allows the trade or transfer of units, bases, technology and energy. The Planetary Council, similar to the United Nations Security Council, takes Planet-wide actions and determines population victories.|$|E

5|$|Vladimir Ćorović noted that, in {{comparison}} with Dušan, who had also left a considerably extended state, Tvrtko was not an overly ambitious conqueror so much as he was an able statesman. Tvrtko, he wrote, used force when necessary but otherwise took care to appear to Serbians as the legitimate heir {{rather than as a}} foreign subjugator and to the Croatians as the preferable ruler. Emphasizing his patience <b>and</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> Ćorović calls Tvrtko a man capable of making the most out of his opportunities.|$|E
5|$|After Alvarado's brutal {{suppression}} of western Honduras, indigenous resistance against the Spanish had coalesced around the Lenca warleader Lempira, who was reputed to have led {{an army of}} thirty thousand native warriors. Lempira had been quietly building a powerful alliance in southern Higueras, in the mountains south of Gracias a Dios. Its political centre was at the town of the Lenca ruler Entepica, and its greatest stronghold was Lempira's hilltop fortress at Peñol de Cerquín. Lempira also attracted support from the native inhabitants Comayagua valley, and the San Pedro mountains. Even former enemies of Lempira, such as the Cares, swore allegiance to him after he overcame them in battle; though a mixture of force <b>and</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> Lempira's alliance extended as far as San Miguel, in eastern El Salvador, and encompassed some 200 towns. Resistance continued from 1537 into 1538, until Lempira and his forces were defeated in battle by the Spanish, led by Alonso de Cáceres.|$|E

5|$|Intellectual men {{of letters}} like the {{versatile}} Shen Kuo dabbled in subjects {{as diverse as}} mathematics, geography, geology, economics, engineering, medicine, art criticism, archaeology, military strategy, <b>and</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> among others. On a court mission to inspect a frontier region, Shen Kuo once made a raised-relief map of wood and glue-soaked sawdust to show the mountains, roads, rivers, and passes to other officials. He once computed {{the total number of}} possible situations on a game board, another time the longest possible military campaign given the limits of human carriers who would bring their own food and food for other soldiers. Shen Kuo is also noted for improving the designs of the inflow clepsydra clock for a more efficient higher-order interpolation, the armillary sphere, the gnomon, and the astronomical sighting tube; increasing its width for better observation of the pole star and other celestial bodies. Shen Kuo also experimented with camera obscura, only a few decades after the first to do so, Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039).|$|E
5|$|The {{final results}} of the Italian {{campaign}} were limited {{in terms of the}} advantages gained by the Empire. The city of Ancona became a Byzantine base in Italy, accepting the Emperor as sovereign. The Normans of Sicily had been damaged and now came to terms with the Empire, ensuring peace for the rest of Manuel's reign. The Empire's ability to get involved in Italian affairs had been demonstrated. However, given the enormous quantities of gold which had been lavished on the project, it also demonstrated the limits of what money <b>and</b> <b>diplomacy</b> alone could achieve. The expense of Manuel's involvement in Italy must have cost the treasury a great deal (probably more than 2,160,000 hyperpyra or 30,000 pounds of gold), and yet it produced only limited solid gains.|$|E
5|$|Yamhad was {{an ancient}} Semitic kingdom {{centered}} on Ḥalab (Aleppo), Syria. The kingdom emerged {{at the end}} of the 19th century BC, and was ruled by the Yamhadite dynasty kings, who counted on both military <b>and</b> <b>diplomacy</b> to expand their realm. From the beginning of its establishment, the kingdom withstood the aggressions of its neighbors Mari, Qatna and Assyria, and was turned into the most powerful Syrian kingdom of its era through the actions of its king Yarim-Lim I. By the middle of the 18th century BC, most of Syria minus the south came under the authority of Yamhad, either as a direct possession or through vassalage, and for nearly a century and a half, Yamhad dominated northern, northwestern and eastern Syria, and had influence over small kingdoms in Mesopotamia at the borders of Elam. The kingdom was eventually destroyed by the Hittites, then annexed by Mitanni in the 16th centuryBC.|$|E

5|$|Before the 4th century BC, Macedonia {{was a small}} kingdom {{outside of}} the area {{dominated}} by the great city-states of Athens, Sparta, and Thebes, and briefly subordinate to Achaemenid Persia. During {{the reign of the}} Argead king PhilipII (359–336 BC), Macedonia subdued mainland Greece and Thrace through conquest <b>and</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> With a reformed army containing phalanxes wielding the sarissa pike, PhilipII defeated the old powers of Athens and Thebes in the Battle of Chaeronea in 338BC; Sparta was occupied a century later by Antigonus III Doson. PhilipII's son Alexander the Great, leading a federation of Greek states, accomplished his father's objective of commanding the whole of Greece when he destroyed Thebes after the city revolted. During Alexander's subsequent campaign of conquest, he overthrew the Achaemenid Empire and conquered territory that stretched as far as the Indus River. For a brief period, his Macedonian empire was the most powerful in the worldthe definitive Hellenistic state, inaugurating the transition to a new period of Ancient Greek civilization. Greek arts and literature flourished in the new conquered lands and advances in philosophy, engineering, and science spread throughout much of the ancient world. Of particular importance were the contributions of Aristotle, tutor to Alexander, whose writings became a keystone of Western philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Byzantium {{had been}} {{absent from the}} affairs of {{southern}} Italy for almost a century, but the accession of Basil the Macedonian changed this: from 868 on, the imperial fleet <b>and</b> <b>diplomacy</b> were employed {{in an effort to}} secure the Adriatic Sea from Saracen raids, re-establish Byzantine dominance over Dalmatia, and extend Byzantine control once more over parts of Italy. Otranto was taken from the Saracens in 873, and Bari in 876. According to the Byzantine sources, during his tenure in Italy Nikephoros recovered numerous towns taken by the Arabs in the previous years, including Taranto, Bari, Santa Severina, Rhegion and Taormina, Tropai and especially Amantia, which Maxentios had previously attacked without success. According to the continuators of Georgios Monachos, he was besieging Amantia when news came of Emperor Basil's death and his own recall by Leo VI; Nikephoros kept the news a secret until he had persuaded the Arab garrison to surrender on guarantee of safe passage. During his time in Italy he also took steps to strengthen the Byzantine position by settling many Armenians in the region, as well as 1,000 manumitted slaves donated by Emperor Basil's old benefactor, the widow Danielis. The 11th-century historian John Skylitzes furthermore reports that Nikephoros brought an end to abuse against the local population, by ending the practice of returning Byzantine soldiers carrying off local Italians to be sold off in the East as slaves. According to Skylitzes, the grateful Italians dedicated a church in his honour. By the time of his departure, he had extended Byzantine control over most of Apulia and Calabria. These victories were followed up by his successors and laid the foundation of a resurgence of Byzantine power in southern Italy, culminating in the establishment of the theme of Longobardia in ca. 892. The regions of Apulia, Calabria and Basilicata would remain firmly under Byzantine control until the 11th century.|$|E
