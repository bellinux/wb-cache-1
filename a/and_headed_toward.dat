5|$|Rescuers {{heading to}} the scene of the Kehoe farm fire heard the {{explosion}} at the school building, turned back, <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>toward</b> the school. Parents within the rural community also began rushing to the school. The school building had turned into a war zone with 38 people killed in the initial explosion, mostly children.|$|E
5|$|Then, on October 14, the National Weather Bureau {{issued a}} warning for the Carolinas, with the caveat {{that the worst}} of the {{hurricane}} was expected to stay offshore. Instead, the storm took a sharp northwest turn <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>toward</b> land. By evening of the same day, the storm was forecast to make landfall near the Carolinas border. Further forecasts expected Hazel to lose its power and dissipate over the Allegheny Mountains.|$|E
25|$|There were {{a number}} of demonstrations during the 2004 Democratic National Convention. Protesters {{included}} members of the Bl(A)ck Tea Society, a group of self-described anarchists, who opposed the war in Iraq. Approximately 400 members of the Bl(A)ck Tea Society marched through Boston's financial district <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>toward</b> the fleet center, where they set fire to an effigy that showed George Bush on one side and John Kerry on the other.|$|E
50|$|SR 262 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 27/SR 1 (Tallahassee Highway) southeast of Attapulgus, in Decatur County. Here, US 27/SR 1 south almost immediately enter Florida <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> Tallahassee.|$|R

25|$|With Muhammad now on his side, 'Ali {{decided to}} send an {{expedition}} under his brother al-Khalil to al-Sus, where Ahmad ibn Laythawayh, who had been appointed by Masrur al-Balkhi as the military governor of al-Ahwaz, was staying. Al-Khalil and Muhammad joined forces <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>toward</b> the city, but Ibn Laythawayh intercepted them before they arrived and launched an attack. Many of the rebels were killed or captured, and the rest soon withdrew. Ibn Laythawayh then proceeded to Junday Sabur and established himself there.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of the Pyrenees was a {{large-scale}} offensive launched on 25 July 1813 by Marshal Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult from the Pyrénées region on Emperor Napoleon’s order, {{in the hope}} of relieving French garrisons under siege at Pamplona and San Sebastián. After initial success the offensive ground to a halt in face of increased allied resistance under the command of Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Wellington. Soult abandoned the offensive on 30 July <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>toward</b> France, having failed to relieve either garrison.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{hundreds}} of people fled the mall after hearing the gunshots, but many remained inside and dashed to cover. Roberts headed further toward the food court, firing at 16-year-old employee Alina Pavlenko, who was over 100 feet away, but missed. He also dropped three other magazines in his possession. He then turned back <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>toward</b> a JCPenney store. He attempted to reload the AR-15 at that point, {{but was unable to}} do so, the weapon having apparently jammed. During that time, Nick Meli, a concealed carry permit holder, drew his Glock 22, claimed to have taken aim at Roberts, but did not fire since there was a bystander behind Roberts. Meli claims that Roberts saw him and that this may have contributed to Roberts' decision to commit suicide.|$|E

25|$|The railway {{originated}} at a terminus {{near the}} Raymond Station by the Raymond Hotel {{which was the}} premier Pasadena winter residence for many eastern magnates. The rails roughly paralleled Fair Oaks Avenue, then crossed Lincoln Avenue to the east then again to the west <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>toward</b> the Arroyo Seco. It turned northward to an area called Las Casitas (the little houses) then swung wide to the east to an alignment with today's Harriet Street in Altadena and ran between Mendocino and Calaveras streets to a terminus on Lake Avenue which would align with the present-day Altadena Post Office building. This right-of-way agrees with the original plan of a railroad on Woodbury's 1887 plot map, and lends support {{to the idea that}} this railroad had greater purpose than that of appeasing a couple of millionaires, even though they were often the only riders.|$|E
25|$|By all accounts, Smith was a well-respected and even-tempered man. However Bogan's taunts {{began to}} wear on Smith, who {{eventually}} climbed down from his wagon <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>toward</b> Bogan. As Smith walked toward Bogan, the latter stuck his hand into his coat. Smith told {{him that if he}} pulled his gun, he'd knock him to the ground. Bogan did pull his pistol, at which point Smith did knock him down with one punch. The two then wrestled briefly before Smith was able to take the young man's gun from him. As he did this, Kemp ran over producing his own handgun, and hit Smith {{in the back of the}} head. Smith then turned and pointed his pistol at Kemp, and pulled the trigger. However, the pistol misfired, according to witnesses, and Kemp fled at top speed. Smith turned Bogan's pistol over to the town marshal.|$|E
25|$|Soon thereafter, Wang was {{recalled}} {{back from}} the Ze front and instead ordered to attack Yun Prefecture to recapture it, with Zhang Hanjie serving as the monitor of his army, {{as part of a}} four-prong counterattack against Later Tang that Duan was envisioning—having Dong attack northwest toward Taiyuan, having Huo attack north toward Zhending (真定, in modern Baoding, Hebei), having Wang attack northeast toward Yun, and having Duan himself attack the Later Tang emperor directly near Desheng. This four-prong plan was revealed to the Later Tang emperor, however, when the Later Liang officer Kang Yanxiao defected to Later Tang. Kang also revealed that the main strength was with Duan, who had by that point crossed the Yellow River <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>toward</b> what he believed to be the Later Tang main army. The Later Tang emperor decided to risk opening up his rear by heading immediately to Yun to rendezvous with Li Siyuan, bypassing the Later Liang main army, and attack Daliang directly.|$|E
5000|$|When General Robert E. Lee {{learned of}} the VI Corps breakthrough, he {{notified}} Confederate President Jefferson Davis {{that he would be}} forced to abandon Richmond <b>and</b> Petersburg <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> Danville that night.

50|$|Soon Alliance was noticeably {{pulling away}} from the pursuers but Duc de Lauzun - second in line - was losing ground to Alarm. In the distance, the {{newcomer}} was seen to change course <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> Alliance. Alarm evidently gave up the chase <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> away. Sybil pressed on and soon began firing at Duc de Lauzun.|$|R
5000|$|... al-Mutayri {{admitted}} leaving Kuwait {{only days}} after 9/11, with $15,000 in cash, <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> the Pakistan-Afghan border regions. His name later {{appeared on a}} list of captives detained in prison, which the United States used as evidence {{he was a member of}} al-Qaeda, a notion rejected by the judge.|$|R
25|$|But, as is {{told in the}} Rotensian Chronicle (the {{chronicle of}} Alfonso III of Asturias in which Pelayo is {{considered}} the successor of the kings of Toledo, with clear goals of political legitimacy) {{as well as in}} that of Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari (a Maghrebi historian of the 16th century who died in Cairo, Egypt, and who could have used the Rotensian Chronicle and rewritten it eight centuries later, making it useless as a historical document), Pelayo escaped from Cordoba during the governorship of al-Hurr (717-718) and his return to Asturias triggered a revolt against the Muslim authorities of Gijón. The identity of Pelayo, however, is still an open subject, and that {{is only one of the}} theories. The leader of the Astures, whose origin is debated by historians, had at that time his home in Bres (in the district of Piloña) and Munuza sent his troops there under al-Qama. After receiving word of the arrival of the Muslims, Pelayo and his companions hurriedly crossed the Piloña <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>toward</b> the narrow, easily defended valley of Auseva mountain, and took refuge in one of its caves, Covadonga. After an attempt at siege was abandoned due to the weather and the exposed position of the deep valley gorge, the troops are said to have taken to exit through the high ports to the south, in order to continue in the search and destroy action against other rebels. There the locals were able to ambush the Muslim detachment, which was annihilated. The rest of its survivors continued south to the plains of Leon, leaving the maritime districts of Asturias exposed and weakened of defenders.|$|E
500|$|The {{expected}} North Korean {{attack on}} Kyongju, however, never came. The North Koreans turned east, crossed the highway {{north of the}} town, <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>toward</b> Yonil Airfield. The next day the US Air Force, attacking North Korean gun positions [...] north of Kyongju along the road, found many targets in the Kigye-Kyongju-P'ohang-dong triangle as they caught the North Koreans advancing in the open.|$|E
500|$|While in Bergen, Prinz Eugen took on [...] of fuel; Bismarck inexplicably {{failed to}} {{similarly}} refuel. At 19:30 on 21 May, Prinz Eugen, Bismarck, {{and the three}} escorting destroyers left port. By midnight, the force was in the open sea <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>toward</b> the Arctic Ocean. At this time, Admiral Raeder finally informed Hitler of the operation, who reluctantly allowed it to continue as planned. The three escorting destroyers were detached at 04:14 on 22 May, while the force steamed off Trondheim. At around 12:00, Lütjens ordered his two ships to turn toward the Denmark Strait to attempt the breakout into the open waters of the Atlantic.|$|E
50|$|The river {{originates}} in the Acushnet cedar swamp in New Bedford, and in Sassaquin Pond, also called Myles Pond. It runs through Dartmouth, passing under U.S. Route 6 and the town's former dump, <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> Russells Mills, <b>and</b> eventually drains into the Slocums River, with an associated floodplain in Apponagansett Swamp.|$|R
50|$|The {{north end}} of the bridge, on the Calvert side, is located in Solomons. Just prior to the bridge, MD 2-4 narrows from four lanes to two, and MD 2 exits the highway, passing under the bridge <b>and</b> <b>heading</b> <b>toward</b> {{downtown}} Solomons.

500|$|Most protesters {{ran after}} hearing gunshots and a {{helicopter}} chased them. After shooting stopped, protesters regrouped. One youth picked a rock <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>toward</b> the army, {{only to be}} stopped by four other protesters. A witness interviewed by Physicians for Human Rights {{said that he and}} other protesters moved closer to army forces following the initial shooting. According to him he asked [...] "Why do you shoot us? We had our hands up. We are peaceful. What do you want from us?", one soldier replied [...] "I want you to leave. If you do not turn back, I have orders to shoot". Arriving ambulances started evacuating the injured when army opened fire again.|$|E
500|$|In August 1799, Archduke Charles {{received}} {{orders from}} his brother, the Emperor, {{to withdraw the}} Austrian army across the Rhine. [...] While Charles could see this to be unreasonable—Alexander Suvorov had not yet reached central Switzerland, and it was folly to think that Alexander Korsakov's force of 30,000 and Hotze's 20,000 could hold all of the region until {{the arrival of the}} rest of the Russian force—the order was emphatic. Charles delayed as long as he could, but in late August he withdrew his force across the Rhine <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>toward</b> Phillipsburg. When Suvorov heard of this breach of military common-sense, he wondered [...] "the owl [...] has either gone out of his mind, or he never had one." [...] The order was eventually reversed too late for the Archduke to stop his withdrawal.|$|E
500|$|After dusk on 10 November, Kaiser left Shanghai <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>toward</b> Kiautschou. Prinzess Wilhelm and [...] were {{to leave}} the {{following}} day to allay suspicion. The three ships rendezvoused on the 12th at sea; Diederichs intended to steam into Kiautschou on the 14th and seize the port. At 06:00 on the 14th, Cormoran steamed into the bay to bring the Chinese forts under fire, while Kaiser and Prinzess Wilhelm sent a landing force of some 700men ashore. In the span of two hours, Diederichs's forces had captured the central and outlying forts and destroyed the Chinese telegraph, preventing them from notifying their superiors of the German attack. After negotiating with General Chang, {{the commander of the}} Kiautschou garrison, Diederichs succeeded in forcing the Chinese concession of Kiautschou to Germany, which he proclaimed at 14:20. Diederichs was promoted to Vice Admiral following the successful seizure of the port.|$|E
50|$|Later, Yousef Bey, who {{has arrived}} in Mapleton, calls on Amon-Ra to aid {{him in his}} quest and begins to brew the sacred fluid of the tana leaves to summon Kharis. Kharis senses the leaves <b>and</b> <b>heads</b> <b>toward</b> them, murdering a {{helpless}} farmer along the way. The Sheriff soon arrives {{on the scene and}} organizes a search party.|$|R

Among the vessels escorting Iowa on this trip was the destroyer [...] which was involved in several mishaps, the most serious of which involved a torpedo drill which went awry when a torpedo from William D. Porter discharged from its tube <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>toward</b> Iowa. On being warned, Iowa turned hard to avoid being hit by the torpedo and the torpedo detonated in the ship's wake. Iowa was unhurt and trained her main guns on William D. Porter, concerned that the smaller ship may have been involved in some sort of assassination plot.|$|E
500|$|She went to {{the garage}} and saw Fischer's body lying face up on the driveway. She told her {{daughter}} Kathy to call 911, and her father, Buddy, who lived a few minutes away. Buddy dressed <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>toward</b> the house. He took a shortcut off Texas highways 77 and 83 to reach the house, and recalled going over [...] at some point, and brushing off a few cars along the way by gesturing with his left hand. Once he reached Rancho Viejo, he ignored the entrance and drove instead through a field of palm trees. As he drew closer to Fischer's house, he heard police sirens at a distance. When he arrived, he saw his son's body holding a garden hose. The running water had covered the entire roadway with Fischer's blood. Witnesses, including Eric, recall seeing a short-bearded Hispanic man in his mid-20s driving a white, four-door vehicle with Mexican license plates speeding away after the attack. Kathy then phoned one of Fischer's closest friends before school started {{and asked him if}} he knew if Fischer had any enemies. Fischer's friend could not think of anyone who disliked him, and only recalled that he and Fischer had been in an altercation with a group of boys at a football game.|$|E
