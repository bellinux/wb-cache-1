5|$|The {{rescue of}} Bat 21 was a {{watershed}} {{event for the}} military and led them to find <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> high-threat search and rescue. They recognized that, if a SAR mission was predestined to fail, {{it should not be}} attempted, and other options, such as special operations, diversionary tactics and other creative approaches tailored to the situation, had to be considered. Recognizing the need for an aircraft that could deliver better close air support, the Air Force accepted the Navy's A-7 Corsair. The military also improved the night capability of helicopters and area denial munitions.|$|E
5|$|After scoring 1,050runs (including six centuries) at {{an average}} of 75.00 in the 1940–41 season, Barnes played little cricket until 1945–46, when he scored centuries in five {{successive}} matches for New South Wales. He was picked for the 1945–46 Australian tour of New Zealand and played in the representative match that was later designated as the first Test match between the two countries: he made 54 as Australia won easily. The post-war period also saw <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> batting on the part of Barnes. He discarded his aggressive and flamboyant shot-making and re-invented himself as a watchful, more defensive player, which made his scoring more prolific, although less crowd pleasing.|$|E
