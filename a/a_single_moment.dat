The mistress clearly {{knew what she was}} doing sleeping with an older man, and yet there is something expletive about it as well. Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to invest in <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>moment</b> while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.|$|E

25|$|Some modern biblical {{scholars}} explain Mount Sinai {{as having}} been a sacred place dedicated {{to one of the}} Semitic deities, even before the Israelites encountered it.

25|$|A deeper {{understanding}} of the mechanisms underlying consciousness on the biochemical level has practical implications which extend to the development of more effective and reliable anesthetics. This method is especially useful for the study of consciousness because of anesthetic's well-known ability to elicit unconsciousness.

Stuart Hameroff is a notable anesthesiologist who promotes this method {{in the development of a}} science of consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{development}} of modern scientific method, Catholic theology had allowed for biblical text to be read as allegorical, rather than literal, where it appeared to contradict that which could be established by science or reason. Thus Catholicism {{has been able to}} refine its understanding of scripture in light of scientific discovery. Among the early Church Fathers there was debate over whether God created the world in six days, as Clement of Alexandria taught, or in <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>moment</b> as held by Augustine, and a literal interpretation of Genesis was normally taken for granted in the Middle Ages and later, until it was rejected in favour of uniformitarianism (entailing far greater timeframes) by a majority of geologists in the 19th century. However modern literal creationism has had little support among the higher levels of the Church.|$|E

500|$|For the album's promotion, Jackson {{appeared}} as a host on Saturday Night Live performing two songs, and {{she was also a}} guest star on sitcom Will & Grace portraying herself.

500|$|The {{critical}} {{recognition and}} renown of Astral Weeks came to overshadow Morrison's subsequent work, {{as well as}} Morrison himself. According to biographer Johnny Rogan, his recording career was [...] "all too often crystallized in <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>moment.</b> Like the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Astral Weeks was perceived as a one-off whose critical standing allowed little discussion for other equally fascinating musical forays that followed." [...] Morrison felt annoyed by the retrospective acclaim and claims about the record's significance. In agreement with Logan's original criticism, he later said he should have [...] "changed the arrangements because the arrangements are too samey ... four or five other songs {{should have had a}} change of mood." [...] Merenstein, on the other hand, still admires the album: [...] "To this day it gives me pain to hear it. Pain is the wrong word—I'm so moved by it." [...] In 2001, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, having shipped 500,000 copies in the US. Music historian Andrew Ford said the album's commercial performance, much like its musical aesthetic, is similar to classical music: [...] "Neither instant nor evanescent: Astral Weeks will sell as many copies this year as it did in 1968 and has every year in between".|$|E

[...] Allrovi reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that [...] "There isn't <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>moment</b> that establishes a distinct musical identity, and the whole thing is rather embarrassing."

[...] Bradley Stern of MuuMuse described [...] "Venus" [...] as [...] "a track just weird and stupid and messy and catchy enough to work."

There, Jor-El informs Clark he needs to begin his training in order to complete his destiny, but Clark interrupts the training to go back to Smallville, which forces Jor-El to strip Clark of his powers. When Clark is killed in his mortal body in season five's [...] "Hidden", Jor-El resurrects Clark with his powers; as a result, Jonathan's life is traded for Clark's in the episode [...] "Reckoning". Clark's consistent disobedience forces Jor-El to imprison his son in a block of ice in the season seven episode [...] "Blue", but after learning a clone of Clark has returned to Smallville in [...] "Persona", Jor-El frees his son so he can take care of the creature. When Clark thinks a world without him would be better, Jor-El sends Clark to an alternate reality to show him the world would be worse if he did not exist in it. By the start of season nine, Jor-El begins fully training Clark for his ultimate destiny. As part of that training, Jor-El informs Clark he needs to tune his Kryptonian intuition. To do so, Jor-El gives Clark the ability to read people's thoughts, only to take it away at an important moment and force Clark to apply what he has learned about human behavior. A clone of Jor-El is released on Earth in the episode [...] "Kandor", but he is murdered before he can fully reunite with Clark and is only able to share <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>moment</b> with his son before dying.|$|E

In 1887, he established the weekly [...] "Saturday Blade", an illustrated newspaper aimed at rural audiences and sold by thousands of newsboys—an innovation at the time. By 1892, the Saturday Blade had the largest circulation of any weekly newspaper in the United States. Boyce's detailed reports of his foreign travels provided articles for the [...] "Saturday Blade" [...] and were reprinted in books by atlas/map publisher Rand McNally. The success of the [...] "Saturday Blade" [...] spawned the W. D. Boyce Publishing Company, which Boyce used to buy or start several newspapers and magazines. In 1892, Boyce bought out the [...] "Chicago Ledger", a fiction weekly publication. In January 1903 {{he founded the}} international [...] "Boyce's Weekly", which advocated worker's rights. Boyce's prominence as a supporter of labor attracted labor/union [...] leaders such as John Mitchell of the United Mine Workers and Henry Demarest Lloyd as writers and editors for [...] "Boyce's Weekly". Eight months later, [...] "Boyce's Weekly" [...] was consolidated with the [...] "Saturday Blade." [...] Boyce also established the selected subject/topical newspapers [...] "Farm Business" [...] in 1914 and [...] "Home Folks Magazine" [...] in 1922.

As Boyce's enterprises grew, he insisted on looking after the welfare of about 30,000 delivery boys, who were key to his financial success. Working with them may have helped him {{gain an understanding of}} America's youth. Boyce felt that delivering and selling newspapers taught a youth important responsibilities such as being polite, reading human nature, and handling money. Boyce's focused determination was evident in the advice he gave to young men: [...] "There are many obstacles to overcome, but toil, grit and endurance will help you to overcome them all. Help yourself and others will help you." [...] and [...] "whatever trade you have selected; never swerve from that purpose <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>moment</b> until it is accomplished".|$|E
