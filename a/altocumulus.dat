5|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} often {{precursors}} of {{other types of}} cloud, such as cumulonimbus, when influenced by weather factors such as instability, moisture, and temperature gradient. Normally, cumulus clouds produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing congestus or cumulonimbus clouds. Cumulus clouds can be formed from water vapor, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals, depending upon the ambient temperature. They come in many distinct subforms, and generally cool the earth by reflecting the incoming solar radiation. Cumulus clouds are part of the larger category of free-convective cumuliform clouds, which include cumulonimbus clouds. The latter genus-type is sometimes categorized separately as cumulonimbiform due to its more complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top. There are also cumuliform clouds of limited convection that comprise stratocumulus (low-), <b>altocumulus</b> (middle-étage) and cirrocumulus. (high-étage). These last three genus-types are sometimes classified separately as stratocumuliform.|$|E
5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into <b>altocumulus</b> and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E
25|$|This is a mid-level stratocumuliform {{cloud layer}} of limited {{convection}} {{that is usually}} appears {{in the form of}} irregular patches or more extensive sheets arranges in groups, lines, or waves. <b>Altocumulus</b> near the top of its range may resemble cirrocumulus but is usually thicker and composed of water droplets so that the bases show at least some light-grey shading. Opaque <b>altocumulus</b> associated with a weak frontal or low-pressure disturbance can produce virga, very light intermittent precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground. If the <b>altocumulus</b> is mixed with moisture-laden altostratus, the precipitation may reach the ground.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for some species to show combined varieties at one time, especially if one variety is opacity-based {{and the other is}} pattern-based. An example of this would be a layer of <b>altocumulus</b> stratiformis arranged in seemingly converging rows separated by small breaks. The full technical name of a cloud in this configuration would be <b>altocumulus</b> stratiformis radiatus perlucidus, which would identify respectively its genus, species, and two combined varieties.|$|E
25|$|One {{group of}} {{supplementary}} features are not actual cloud formations, but precipitation that falls when water droplets or ice crystals {{that make up}} visible clouds have grown too heavy to remain aloft. Virga is a feature seen with clouds producing precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground, these being of the genera cirrocumulus, <b>altocumulus,</b> altostratus, nimbostratus, stratocumulus, cumulus, and cumulonimbus.|$|E
25|$|The mamma feature {{forms on}} {{the bases of}} clouds as downward-facing bubble-like protuberances caused by {{localized}} downdrafts within the cloud. It is also sometimes called mammatus, {{an earlier version of}} the term used before a standardization of Latin nomenclature brought about by the World Meterorological Organization during the 20th century. The best-known is cumulonimbus with mammatus, but the mamma feature is also seen occasionally with cirrus, cirrocumulus, <b>altocumulus,</b> altostratus, and stratocumulus.|$|E
25|$|Clouds of this {{structure}} have both cumuliform and stratiform characteristics {{in the form}} of rolls, ripples, or patches. They generally form as a result of limited convection in an otherwise mostly stable airmass topped by an inversion layer. If the inversion layer is absent or higher in the troposphere, increased convective activity may cause the cloud layers to develop tops {{in the form of}} turrets consisting of embedded cumuliform buildups. The stratocumuliform group is divided into cirrocumulus (high-level), <b>altocumulus</b> (mid-level), and stratocumulus (low-level).|$|E
500|$|<b>Altocumulus</b> {{clouds are}} a middle-étage cloud that forms from [...] high to [...] in polar areas, [...] in {{temperate}} areas, and [...] in tropical areas. They can have precipitation and are commonly {{composed of a}} mixture of ice crystals, supercooled water droplets, and water droplets in temperate latitudes. However, the liquid water concentration was almost always significantly greater than the concentration of ice crystals, and the maximum concentration of liquid water tended {{to be at the}} top of the cloud while the ice concentrated itself at the bottom. The ice crystals in the base of the <b>altocumulus</b> clouds and in the virga were found to be dendrites or conglomerations of dendrites while needles and plates resided more towards the top. <b>Altocumulus</b> clouds can form via convection or via the forced uplift caused by a warm front. Because <b>Altocumulus</b> is a genus-type of limited convection, it is divided into the same four species as cirrocumulus.|$|E
500|$|Smaller cumulus or {{stratocumulus}} clouds, {{along with}} cirrus, and, sometimes, <b>altocumulus</b> or cirrocumulus, {{can be found}} ahead of the squall line. [...] These clouds {{are the result of}} former cumulonimbus clouds having disintegrated, or an area of only minor instability ahead of the main squall line.|$|E
500|$|In the {{intermediate}} range, from [...] to [...] in temperate regions, are the mid-étage clouds. They comprise {{two or three}} genera depending on the system of height classification being used: altostratus, <b>altocumulus,</b> and, according to WMO classification, nimbostratus. These clouds are formed from ice crystals, supercooled water droplets, or liquid water droplets.|$|E
500|$|Winds {{along the}} coast of Texas reached [...] at {{numerous}} points near the hurricane's center. A report from Galveston explained, [...] "There was little characteristic sky appearance prior to the advent of the storm, the sky being mostly clear until lower clouds appeared suddenly between 6 and 7 a. m. C. S. T., on the 22d with <b>altocumulus</b> and alto-stratus overcast showing through breaks occasionally during the day. By late afternoon of the 22d the sky became completely overcast with low clouds of bad weather which predominated throughout the remainder of the storm." [...] Tides at the city, already slightly above-normal due to a previous storm, rose to a crest of [...] on September 23, flooding large portions of Galveston Island. A local airport was flooded with [...] of tidewater.|$|E
500|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} a genus of free-convective low-étage cloud {{along with the}} related limited-convective {{cumuliform}} or stratocumuliform cloud stratocumulus. These clouds form from ground level to [...] at all latitudes. Stratus clouds are also low-étage. In the middle étage are the alto clouds, which consist of the limiited-convective cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud <b>altocumulus</b> and the stratiform cloud altostratus. Middle-étage clouds form from [...] to [...] in polar areas, [...] in temperate areas, and [...] in tropical areas. The high-étage clouds are all cirriform, one of which, cirrocumulus, is also cumuliform of limited convection or stratocumuliform. The other clouds in this étage are cirrus and cirrostratus. High-étage clouds form [...] in high latitudes, [...] in temperate latitudes, and [...] in low, tropical latitudes. Cumulonimbus clouds, like cumulus congestus, extend vertically rather than remaining confined to one étage.|$|E
2500|$|Another variety, {{duplicatus}} (closely spaced {{layers of}} the same type, one above the other), is sometimes found with cirrus of both the fibratus and uncinus species, and with <b>altocumulus</b> and stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and lenticularis. [...] The variety undulatus (having a wavy undulating base) can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or lenticularis, and with altostratus. [...] It is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus. The variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes {{in the form of}} a honeycomb or net. [...] It is occasionally seen with cirrocumulus and <b>altocumulus</b> of the species stratiformis, castellanus, and floccus, and with stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and castellanus.|$|E
2500|$|This genus type is a stratocumuliform {{cloud layer}} of limited convection, {{usually in the}} form of {{irregular}} patches or more extensive sheets similar to <b>altocumulus</b> but having larger elements with deeper-gray shading. [...] Opaque stratocumulus can produce very light intermittent precipitation. This cloud often forms under a precipitating deck of altostratus or high-based nimbostratus associated with a well-developed warm front, slow-moving cold front, or low-pressure area. This can create the illusion of continuous precipitation of more than very light intensity falling from stratocumulus.|$|E
2500|$|Non-vertical {{clouds in}} the middle level are prefixed by alto-, {{yielding}} the genus names <b>altocumulus</b> (Ac) and altostratus (As). These clouds can form as low as [...] above surface at any latitude, but may be based as high as [...] near the poles, [...] at mid latitudes, and [...] in the tropics. [...] As with high clouds, {{it is not possible}} to distinguish between individual forms or genera using satellite photography alone. [...] Without the support of human observations, these clouds are usually collectively identified as middle-type on satellite images.|$|E
2500|$|A newly {{recognized}} {{species of}} stratocumulus or <b>altocumulus</b> {{has been given}} the name volutus, a roll cloud that can occur ahead of a cumulonimbus formation. [...] There are some volutus clouds that form {{as a consequence of}} interactions with specific geographical features rather than with a parent cloud. Perhaps the strangest geographically specific cloud of this type is the Morning Glory, a rolling cylindrical cloud that appears unpredictably over the Gulf of Carpentaria in Northern Australia. Associated with a powerful [...] "ripple" [...] in the atmosphere, the cloud may be [...] "surfed" [...] in glider aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Stratocumuliform genus-types (cirrocumulus, <b>altocumulus,</b> and stratocumulus) {{that appear}} in mostly stable air have two species each. [...] The {{stratiformis}} species normally occur in extensive sheets or in smaller patches where there is only minimal convective activity. Clouds of the lenticularis species tend to have lens-like shapes tapered at the ends. They are most commonly seen as orographic mountain-wave clouds, but can occur anywhere in the troposphere where there is strong wind shear combined with sufficient airmass stability to maintain a generally flat cloud structure. [...] These two species {{can be found in}} the high, middle, or low level of the troposphere depending on the stratocumuliform genus or genera present at any given time.|$|E
2500|$|All cloud {{varieties}} {{fall into}} one of two main groups. [...] One group identifies the opacities of particular low and mid-level cloud structures and comprises the varieties translucidus (thin translucent), perlucidus (thick opaque with translucent or very small clear breaks), and opacus (thick opaque). [...] These varieties are always identifiable for cloud genera and species with variable opacity. [...] All three are associated with the stratiformis species of <b>altocumulus</b> and stratocumulus. [...] However, only two varieties are seen with altostratus and stratus nebulosus whose uniform structures prevent the formation of a perlucidus variety. [...] Opacity-based varieties are not applied to high clouds because they are always translucent, {{or in the case of}} cirrus spissatus, always opaque. [...] Similarly, these varieties are also not associated with moderate and towering vertical clouds because they are always opaque.|$|E
2500|$|A {{second group}} {{describes}} the occasional arrangements of cloud structures into particular patterns that are discernible by a surface-based observer (cloud fields usually being visible {{only from a}} significant altitude above the formations). These varieties are not always present with the genera and species {{with which they are}} otherwise associated, but only appear when atmospheric conditions favor their formation. Intortus and vertebratus varieties occur on occasion with cirrus fibratus. [...] They are respectively filaments twisted into irregular shapes, and those that are arranged in fishbone patterns, usually by uneven wind currents that favor the formation of these varieties. [...] The variety radiatus is associated with cloud rows of a particular type that appear to converge at the horizon. [...] It is sometimes seen with the fibratus and uncinus species of cirrus, the stratiformis species of <b>altocumulus</b> and stratocumulus, the mediocris and sometimes humilis species of cumulus, and with the genus altostratus.|$|E
2500|$|These {{species are}} subdivisions of genus types {{that occur in}} partly {{unstable}} air. The species castellanus appears when a mostly stable stratocumuliform or cirriform layer becomes disturbed by localized areas of airmass instability, usually {{in the morning or}} afternoon. This results in the formation of cumuliform buildups arising from a common stratiform base. Castellanus resembles the turrets of a castle when viewed from the side, and can be found with stratocumuliform genera at any tropospheric altitude level and with limited-convective patches of high-level cirrus. Tufted clouds of the more detached floccus species are subdivisions of genus-types which may be cirriform or stratocumuliform in overall structure. They are sometimes seen with cirrus, and with tufted cirrocumulus, <b>altocumulus,</b> and stratocumulus. [...] Low and mid level castellanus or floccus can resemble cumulo- and cumulonimbogenitus formations (see 'Mother clouds' section). [...] However, the latter genitus types are seen mostly in the evening and are the result of cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds dissipating rather than forming or building.|$|E
2500|$|Several new {{supplementary}} features have been formally {{recognized by the}} World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The feature fluctus can form under conditions of strong atmospheric wind shear and instability when wave-like clouds of the variety undulatus break into regularly spaced crests. This variant is sometimes known informally as a Kelvin–Helmholtz (wave) cloud. [...] This phenomenon has also been observed in cloud formations over other planets {{and even in the}} sun's atmosphere. [...] Another highly disturbed but more chaotic wave-like cloud feature associated with the undulatus variety has been given the Latin name asperitus. [...] The supplementary feature cavum is a circular fall-streak hole that occasionally forms in a thin layer of supercooled <b>altocumulus</b> or cirrocumulus. [...] Fall streaks consisting of virga or wisps of cirrus are usually seen beneath the hole as ice crystals fall out to a lower altitude. [...] This type of hole is usually larger than typical lacunosus holes. A murus feature is a cumulonimbus wall cloud with a lowering, rotating cloud base than can lead to the development of tornadoes. A cauda feature is a tail cloud that extends horizontally away from the murus cloud and is the result of air feeding into the storm.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Altocumulus</b> cloud as {{seen from}} the Space Shuttle. <b>Altocumulus</b> clouds are formed by {{convective}} activity.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Altocumulus</b> (From Latin Altus, [...] "high", cumulus, [...] "heaped") is a middle-altitude {{cloud genus}} that belongs {{mainly to the}} stratocumuliform {{physical}} category characterized by globular masses or rolls in layers or patches, the individual elements being larger and darker than those of cirrocumulus and smaller than those of stratocumulus. [...] However, if the layers become tufted in appearance due to increased airmass instability, then the <b>altocumulus</b> clouds become more purely cumuliform in structure. Like other cumuliform and stratocumuliform clouds, <b>altocumulus</b> signifies convection. A sheet of partially conjoined <b>altocumulus</b> perlucidus is sometimes found preceding a weakening warm front, where the altostratus is starting to fragment, resulting in patches of <b>altocumulus</b> perlucidus between the areas of altostratus. <b>Altocumulus</b> is also commonly found between the warm and cold fronts in a depression, although this is often hidden by lower clouds.|$|E
50|$|Towering <b>altocumulus,</b> {{known as}} <b>altocumulus</b> castellanus, {{frequently}} signals {{the development of}} thunderstorms later in the day, as it shows instability and convection in the middle levels of the troposphere, the area where towering cumulus clouds can turn into cumulonimbus. It is therefore one of three warning clouds often recorded by the aviation industry, the other two being towering cumulus and cumulonimbus. <b>Altocumulus</b> generally forms about 2,000 to 6,100 m above ground level, a similar level to altostratus formations, and satellite photography has revealed that {{the two types of}} cloud can create formations that can stretch for thousands of square miles. Extensive <b>altocumulus</b> formations, particularly if they take the form of undulatus are often referred to as <b>altocumulus</b> mackerel sky.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Altocumulus</b> Castellanus {{clouds are}} {{typically}} accompanied by moderate turbulence {{as well as}} potential icing conditions. For these reasons, flight through <b>Altocumulus</b> Castellanus clouds is often best avoided by aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Pattern-based varieties: Radiatus (arranged in {{parallel}} bands) is sometimes {{seen with the}} stratformis and castellanus species. <b>Altocumulus</b> stratiformis radiatus of any opacity is coded CM5 if it is increasing in amount. The duplicatus or undulatus varieties are occasionally seen with the stratiformis and lenticularis species. [...] <b>Altocumulus</b> stratiformis duplicatus is coded CM7 {{if it is not}} overridden by another coding of higher importance. Lacunosus is very occasionally associated with <b>altocumulus</b> of the species stratiformis, castellanus, or floccus.|$|E

50|$|This is a mid-level stratocumuliform {{cloud layer}} of limited {{convection}} {{that is usually}} appears {{in the form of}} irregular patches or more extensive sheets arranges in groups, lines, or waves. <b>Altocumulus</b> near the top of its range may resemble cirrocumulus but is usually thicker and composed of water droplets so that the bases show at least some light-grey shading.

50|$|Stratocumulus {{clouds are}} same in {{appearance}} to <b>altocumulus</b> {{and are often}} mistaken for such. A simple test to distinguish these is to compare the size of individual masses or rolls: when pointing one's hand {{in the direction of}} the cloud, if the cloud is about the size of the thumb, it is altocumulus; if it is the size of one's fist, it is stratocumulus. This often does not apply when stratocumulus is of a broken, fractus form, when it may appear as small as <b>altocumulus.</b> Stratocumulus is also often, though not always, darker in colour than <b>altocumulus.</b>|$|E
50|$|For mid-level <b>altocumulus</b> and altostratus, {{the range}} is 0 to -20 °C.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: An {{occurrence}} of cloud iridescence with <b>altocumulus</b> volutus and cirrocumulus stratiformis ...|$|E
50|$|However, {{although}} the species castellanus applies to different genera of convective clouds at different levels, {{the most current}} cloud type is the <b>altocumulus</b> castellanus, the base of {{which is in the}} medium level. This is reinforced by the fact that pilot's manuals interchangeably talk about either castellanus or <b>altocumulus</b> castellanus, restricting {{the meaning of the word}} catellanus.|$|E
50|$|Lenticular clouds (<b>Altocumulus</b> lenticularis) are {{stationary}} lens-shaped {{clouds that}} {{form in the}} troposphere, normally in perpendicular alignment to the wind direction. There are three types of lenticular clouds: <b>altocumulus</b> standing lenticular (ACSL), stratocumulus standing lenticular (SCSL), and cirrocumulus standing lenticular (CCSL). Because of their shape, they have been offered as an explanation for some unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings.|$|E
