5000|$|It was contended {{on behalf}} of the {{plaintiff}} that any amendment of the Treaties establishing the Communities made after 1 January 1973, when Ireland joined those Communities would require a further amendment of the Constitution. It was contended {{on behalf of}} the defendants that the authorisation contained in the first sentence of Article 29, s. 4, sub-s. 3 was to join Communities which were established by Treaties as dynamic and developing entities and that it should be interpreted as authorising the State to participate in and agree to amendments of the Treaties which are within the original scope and objectives of the Treaties. It is the opinion of the Court that the first sentence in Article 29, s. 4, sub-s. 3 of the Constitution must be construed as an <b>authorisation</b> <b>given</b> to the State not only to join the Communities as they stood in 1973, but also to join in amendments of the Treaties so long as such amendments do not alter the essential scope or objectives of the Communities. To hold that the first sentence of Article 29, s. 4, sub-s. 3 does not authorise any form of amendment to the Treaties after 1973 without a further amendment of the Constitution would be too narrow a construction; to construe it as an open-ended authority to agree, without further amendment of the Constitution, to any amendment of the Treaties would be too broad.

A Delphi panel participants comprising of nine experts - with a combined experience base of over 130 years - provided the data. The strategic drivers as well as the key competencies of the South African mining house showed marked similarities to industries such as petrochemical, engineering and construction industries abroad. While safety enjoys higher priority in the South African mining environment than in comparable industries abroad, there is room for improvement in the level of prioritisation of projects that takes place within project portfolios. The degree of <b>authorisation</b> <b>given</b> to project teams within the South African mining house to execute the project strategy is lower than that in comparable industries abroad while the level of business focus and business awareness within the South African mining project teams is relatively high. The correlation between strategic drivers and core competencies was weaker than would be expected. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Mining is {{essential}} to the human well-being in many aspects. Mining activities, however, contribute significantly to pollution and other environmental impacts in South Africa. Recently much more stringent environmental legislation has been developed in South Africa due to increased public awareness and environmental disasters caused by mining activities. Authorisations constitute one of the main "command and control" instruments {{that can be used to}} influence and direct the behaviour of individuals and organisations to achieve sound environmental protection ultimately. The problem is that in the ever-changing maze of South African environmental legislation, it is often difficult for individuals and organisations to identify, obtain and maintain environmental authorisations. This article provides a legislative framework for the mining sector, explores the purpose and importance of environmental <b>authorisations,</b> <b>gives</b> an overview of the underlying relationship between environmental authorisations, risk assessment and environmental management systems before proposing a generic procedure for identifying, obtaining and maintaining environmental authorisations.

40|$|Raymond Kevorkian : Armenian {{studies and}} the {{beginnings}} of Orientalism in France. Colbert's intructions to Antoine Galland before his third visit to the East in 1679 — shortly after the <b>authorisation</b> <b>given</b> to Oskan Erewanc'i in 1669 {{to set up an}} Armenian-language printing press in Marseilles — initiated a policy of Armenian acquisitions. The study of the Fathers of the Eastern Church became an issue in the theological disputes between Catholics and Protestants, which stimulated study of Armenian liturgical texts and manuscripts. However the collection of Armenian manuscripts at the Royal Library did not develop until abbé Sevin's mission to the East in 1728. Pétis de la Croix, the royal interpreter and professor at the Royal College, translated Armenian documents, and the first school of Armenian specialists in Europe was founded in Venice in 1715. Napo leon's creation of the chair of Armenian at the School of Oriental Languages enabled the inventory of the riches of the Armenian cultural heritage to continue. Kevorkian Raymond H.
