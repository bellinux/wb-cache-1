50|$|A {{surprise}} inspection tends {{to have different}} results than an <b>announced</b> <b>inspection.</b> Leaders wanting to know how others in their organization perform can drop in without warning, to see directly what happens. If an inspection is made known in advance, it can give {{people a chance to}} cover up or to fix mistakes. This could lead to distorted and inaccurate findings. A {{surprise inspection}}, therefore, gives inspectors a better picture of the typical state of the inspected object or process than an <b>announced</b> <b>inspection.</b> It also enhances external confidence in the inspection process. See section 4.12 of the Crear report.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} optimal fines in {{a regulatory}} framework where the regulator can choose either surprise or <b>announced</b> <b>inspections</b> to monitor a firm for compliance. The regulator hires a supervisor who exerts unobservable monitoring effort. The firm can invest in avoidance, but it receives a fine if the supervisor finds evidence of non-compliance.

We find that when inspec-tions are unannounced, the optimal fine is maximal, but when they are announced, the optimal fine may be less than maximal...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the determination of}} the optimal fine for noncompliance by a legislator who anticipates the inspection game between an autonomous inspection agency and polluting firms. This agency can make the inspection of individual firms contingent on ambient pollution. The agency's autonomy implies that it cannot commit itself to <b>announced</b> <b>inspection</b> probabilities. If the legislator centralizes the decision to monitor ambient pollution, the optimal fine is infinitely large. The legislator can then forbid ambient inspections to avoid overenforcement. If the legislator decentralizes the decision to monitor ambient pollution, overenforcement can be avoided by choosing a finite fine. decentralized environmental enforcement; optimal penalties...|$|E

The environmental administration has succeeded in getting a more efficient approach and the business operators has increased their understanding of the authority’s work.     For maintaining and/or even increasing the efficiency it is important for the inspectors to possess competence and professionalism, which is gained through continuous use of utilities from the National Food Agency.

The US government has offered excess fissile {{material that is}} no longer needed for defense purposes for International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection. Measurement results provided by the CHEM were used by the IAEA in a verification experiment to provide confidence that the US successfully blended excess highly enriched uranium (HEU) down to low enriched uranium (LEU). The CHEM measured the uranium enrichment in two cascade header pipes, a 20. 32 -cm HEU pipe and a 7. 62 -cm product LEU pipe. The CHEM determines the amount of {sup 235 }U from the 185. 7 -keV gamma-ray photopeak and the amount of total uranium by x-ray fluorescence (XRF) of the 98. 4 -keV x-ray from uranium with a {sup 57 }Co XRF source. The ratio yields the enrichment.

40|$|India is {{becoming}} an attractive destination for drug development and clinical research. This {{is evidenced by the}} three fold increment in clinical trial applications in last four years to the office of Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). This upward trend is collaborative efforts of all stake holders and the quality of Indian data. Therefore to sustain this trend, it is important that stake holders such as Regulators, Sponsor, CRO, Monitor, Investigators and trial subjects required maintaining high standards of data and conduct of clinical trials. Indian regulations and the role of DCGI in quality check for Indian clinical trials is always a topic of discussion in various forums. A recent move by DCGI for conducting random inspections of investigational sites and companies at short notice, checking their compliance in accordance with the guidelines, and taking action against non-complier is welcomed. This will certainly increase over quality of the clinical trials. Quality of clinical trial conduct is measured on essential documents for their appropriateness and its correctness. It is observed that the stakeholders engaged in multitasking often overlook the requirements or appropriateness of the document due to their focused approach on a specific activity which is on priority. This can lead to serious quality problem and issues. Understanding of the process and documents reviewed by auditor is important to maintain such high quality.
