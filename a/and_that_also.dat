Shortly after Carl von Linné's death his son confirmed that mice had caused [...] "horrible damage" [...] to the plants <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>also</b> moths and mould had caused considerable damage. He tried to rescue them from the neglect they had suffered during his father's later years, and also added further specimens.

500|$|Academics {{and journalists}} have {{developed}} many other interpretations of {{themes in the}} books, some more complex than others, and some including political subtexts. Themes such as normality, oppression, survival, and overcoming imposing odds have all been considered as prevalent throughout the series. Similarly, the theme of making one's way through adolescence and [...] "going over one's most harrowing ordeals—and thus {{coming to terms with}} them" [...] has also been considered. Rowling has stated that the books comprise [...] "a prolonged argument for tolerance, a prolonged plea for an end to bigotry" [...] <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>also</b> pass on a message to [...] "question authority and... not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth".|$|E

500|$|The {{canonical}} {{image of}} Mariano Moreno {{is the one}} from the portrait Mariano Moreno en su mesa de trabajo (...) [...] It {{was done by the}} Chilean artist Pedro Subercaseaux during the centennial of the May Revolution in 1910. The historian Adolfo Carranza asked him to design various allegorical pictures of the event. Carranza belonged to the mainstream line of historians who professed great admiration for Moreno, who he described as follows: [...] "He was the soul of the government of the revolution of May, his nerve, the distinguished statesman of the group managing the ship attacked the absolutism and doubt, anxious to reach the goal of his aspirations and his destiny. Moreno was the compass <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>also</b> grabbed the helm, as he was the strongest and the ablest of those who came to direct it". He asked for a picture that was consistent with this image. The portrait depicts him as a friendly man with an open and round face, a wide forehead, and a serene look. Subsequent interpretations, like those of Antonio Estrada, would follow this style, as would portraits of other members of the Junta. However, as this portrait was made a hundred years after the death of the subject, with no known depictions done during his lifetime, it was thus based on the artist's imagination. It was known that Moreno had clearly visible smallpox scars from the age of eight, but not {{to the point where they}} disfigured his face.|$|E

She confirmed {{her appearance}} at the ceremony, by uploading {{an image of the}} Grammy trophy wrapped with black strings like the Internet memes for the cover art of Rebel Heart. The singer was dressed in a one-piece outfit in matador red, surrounded by male dancers as Minotaurs similar to the song's music video. It was developed by designer Riccardo Tisci for Givenchy and styled by Akerlund. The performance was described as a [...] "beautiful story for why the matadors fight the bulls <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>also</b> reflects life". After being introduced by singers Miley Cyrus and Nicki Minaj, the performance began with images of Madonna on a kabuki screen talking about starting a revolution. She emerged from the screen and started singing, surrounded by the dancers. Near the end, the singer encouraged the audience to sing-along with her, finally being pulled atop the stage on a wire. Dina Gachman from Forbes reported that Madonna's performance was the most-watched moment of the night. Brittany Spanos from Rolling Stone described it as [...] "the legendary singer was out for blood with her first live performance [...] ". Shauna Murphy from MTV News observed Illuminati symbolism with the performance, including rituals, organized religion homage and a metaphor for death. MuuMuse's Bradley Stern listed it as the best performance of the Grammys, saying that [...] "this is how a major pop performance should really look". Her effort to sing live without Auto-Tune during the choreographed performance was also heavily praised.|$|E

2500|$|The {{royal family}} that ruled {{over most of}} Borikén, now known as Puerto Rico, during the precolombian Taíno period used the honorific [...] "Agüeybana" [...] a title that was akin to [...] "High Chief", which has been {{translated}} as the European concept of [...] "king" [...] in some English sources, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>also</b> doubled as a family name. The title itself carried notable sociological and religious influence, with its holder being revered and given utmost respect among the population. The Agüeybana family lived at Cayabo in the southern region of the main island of Puerto Rico, an agriculturally fertile region, from which they coordinated military and political actions with the lesser caciques (in regions that ranged from the central area of Utuado and Orocovis to Arecibo, among others) scattered through the central, east and west regions such {{as well as the}} islands of Vieques and St. Croix.|$|E

2500|$|The {{intensely}} religious Gordon {{had been}} born into the Church of England, but he never quite trusted the Anglian Church, instead preferring his own personal brand of Protestantism. In his worn out state, Gordon {{had some sort of}} religious rebirth, leading him to write to his sister Augusta: [...] "Through the workings of Christ in my body by His Body and Blood, the medicine worked. Ever since the realization of the sacrament, I have been turned upside down". The eccentric Gordon was very religious, but he departed from Christian orthodoxy on a number of points. Gordon believed in reincarnation. In 1877, he wrote in a letter: [...] "This life is only {{one of a series of}} lives which our incarnated part has lived. I have little doubt of our having pre-existed; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>also</b> in the time of our pre-existence we were actively employed. So, therefore, I believe in our active employment in a future life, and I like the thought." [...] Gordon was an ardent Christian cosmologist, who also believed that the Garden of Eden was on the island of Praslin in the Seychelles. Gordon believed that God's throne from which He governed the universe rested upon the earth, which was further surrounded by the firmament.|$|E
2500|$|A {{psychiatrist}} testimony followed. While Dahlgren {{remained silent}} when questioned by police, he had {{cooperated with the}} psychiatrist who commented that she had spent several times more time analyzing Dahlgren than any other person before. According to her, Dahlgren suffered by mixed personality disorder, however not {{to the extent to}} be declared mentally ill during the murders. [...] He had had a sexual relationship with male classmate during his time at high school, with sexual relationships with women afterwards. Dahlgren had claimed to like animals more than people. Before going to Brno, Dahlgren was contemplating going to Africa instead in order to kill poachers there. In Brno, he first felt fine, however later Mr. Harok Sr. started asking him to find a meaningful occupation, which meant {{that he was in the}} same position as back in the US. During repeated interviews with psychiatrist, Dahlgren had spoken about his [...] "internal voice" [...] that tells him what to do [...] "in order to become a hero". This, however, did not reach a state of psychosis: according to the psychiatrist a person in the state of psychosis would not be able to conduct the murders the manner they happened (over several hours, with bodies being dragged to the garage, covered, and with an attempt to burn the house). Defense attorney attacked the psychiatrist claiming that American specialists found that he is suffering from bipolar-type schizoaffective disorder. The psychiatrist refused that saying that she had spent more time with Dahlgren, collected much more data, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>also</b> that Dahlgren had shown no symptoms of such disorder during his long-term pre-trial custody.|$|E
