2500|$|As {{opposed to}} the member states, the {{relation}} of EU law and international law is debated, particularly relating to the European Convention on Human Rights and the United Nations. All EU member states are party to both organisations through international treaties. The Treaty on European Union article 6(2) required the EU to accede to the ECHR, but would [...] "not affect the Union's competences as defined in the Treaties". This was thought necessary before the Treaty of Lisbon 2007 {{to ensure that the}} EU gave adequate protection to human rights, overseen by the external European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. However, in Opinion 2/13, after a request by the Commission to review their plan to accede, the Court of Justice (in Luxembourg) produced a five main reasons why it felt that the <b>accession</b> <b>agreement</b> as it stood was incompatible with the treaties. The reasoning was regarded by a majority of commentators as thinly veiled attempt of the Court of Justice to clutch onto its own power, but it has meant the Commission is redrafting a new <b>accession</b> <b>agreement.</b> Under TEU articles 3(5), 21, 34 and 42, the EU must also respect the principles of the United Nations Charter. After the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution to freeze the assets of suspected terrorists, linked to Osama Bin Laden. This included a Saudi national, Mr Kadi. Sweden froze his assets pursuant to an EU Regulation, which gave effect to the UN Security Council resolution. In Kadi v Commission, Mr Kadi claimed {{there was no evidence that}} he was connected to terrorism, and he had not had a fair trial: a fundamental human right. The opinion of AG Maduro recalled Aharon Barak, of the Supreme Court of Israel, that it [...] "is when the cannons roar that we especially need the laws". The Court of Justice held that even UN member cannot contravene 'the principles that form part of the very community legal order'. In effect the EU has developed a rule that within the boundaries of certain jus cogens principles, other courts may take primacy. The content of those core principles remains open to ongoing judicial dialogue among the senior courts in Europe.|$|E

50|$|The head {{of state}} is often {{designated}} the high contracting party in international treaties {{on behalf of the}} state; signs them either personally or has them signed in his/her name by ministers (government members or diplomats); subsequent ratification, when necessary, may rest with the legislature. The treaties constituting the European Union and the European Communities are noteworthy contemporary cases of multilateral treaties cast in this traditional format, as are the <b>accession</b> <b>agreements</b> of new member states. However, rather than being invariably concluded between two heads of state, it has become common that bilateral treaties are in present times cast in an intergovernmental format, e.g., between the Government of X and the Government of Y, rather than between His Majesty the King of X and His Excellency the President of Y.|$|R
40|$|There is, in theory, a {{plausible}} {{role for the}} European Union as the partner of a militarily assertive United States: the peacekeeper that follows {{in the wake of}} the peacemaker. The war in Iraq, however, has raised the possibility of a diametrically different role for Europe: as a potential imperial rival to the United States. There is no need to invoke the memory of either Rome or Byzantium to make the case that Europe is capable of spoiling America’s unipolar party. The successful conclusion of <b>accession</b> <b>agreements</b> with ten new member countries – not to mention the sustained appreciation of the euro against the dollar since Kennedy’s article appeared – have seemingly vindicated this analysis.

40|$|Since China’s {{application}} in 1987 to resume its {{status in the}} Generalized Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) /World Trade Organization (WTO) {{there has been a}} great deal of debate over the timing of China’s accession.

40|$|The end of {{the long}} process of China’s {{accession}} to the World Trade Organisation is in sight. How will entry into the WTO affect China’s economy? The work reviewed in this paper shows that China will gain substantially from WTO accession. It will gain from the reforms that it has committed to as part of the accession process. It would gain far more from accession, which will give access to the commitments made by WTO members in the Uruguay Round. The value to China of reforming its services sector and restrictions on investment will also be significant. WTO accession also helps the Chinese government achieve domestic support for its reform agenda by tying domestic reforms to gains from liberalisation {{in the rest of the}} world. WTO accession and liberalisation will have significant long-term effects on China’s structure of production and on patterns of trade, and should speed industrial upgrading. China’s liberalisation and structural adjustment can affect the economies it competes with in world markets, for example some of the ASEAN members. However, when liberalisation takes place in the context of a wider program of reform (in the WTO or in APEC), a greater number of sectors are involved and the gains are distributed more broadly. Significant uncertainties remain – the most significant being whether other members will implement their Uruguay Round commitments on textiles and clothing. The <b>accession</b> <b>agreements</b> do not address the risk to China that other countries will resort to anti-dumping actions to protect their industries. The WTO processes also seem unable to deal with another increasingly important source of anxiety – the growth in preferential arrangements. Dealing with these issues requires further work in the WTO, and complementary action outside it. China’s role as APEC chair in 2001 provides opportunities to complement its WTO accession with support for open regional cooperation. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to discuss {{the extent to which}} {{immigration}} has come to be perceived as a security threat by European Union (EU) policy makers. The manner in which immigration issues are presented by policy makers at the European level is assumed to have substantive implications for the choice of instruments in the area. A second purpose is therefore to discuss {{the extent to which the}} development towards a common EU asylum and immigration policy can be interpreted as security policy strategy. Increased immigration during the last few decades has coincided with increasing unemployment and economic restructuring in Western Europe. The issue of immigration became increasingly sensitive in the late 1980 s after the collapse of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, when a tide of illegal immigrants was expected to inundate the West. Today, images of ships loaded with refugees off the shores of Italy, or of trucks filled with illegal immigrants crossing the English Channel, have become disturbing, but no longer rare features of European newspaper headlines. The impression is that of Europe being ‘swamped’, and unable to deal with the hordes of people standing outside its gates wanting in. Since the aim of this report is to examine the change that has taken place in European perspectives on immigration, a study of political discourse will enable us to deconstruct a number of justificatory domains, which are supported by the members of the European policy community. The main hypothesis is that security considerations are clearly reflected in the establishment and development of asylum and immigration instruments following the Amsterdam programme. Another hypothesis is that the framing of immigration as a security threat has legitimised the introduction of objectives and instruments that have their origin in security policy. This is notably to be seen in the <b>accession</b> <b>agreements</b> with the Central and Eastern European applicant countries, as well in the so-called ‘partnership-agreements’ with immigrant countries of origin and transit. Having established the broader aim of this report, I propose two main and inter linked questions as the framework for the analysis: First: To what extent has the issue of asylum and immigration come to be seen as a security threat, and thus as a security matter at the EU level? Second: To what extent is the above question reflected in the objectives and instruments of the common EU asylum and immigration policy? Can the development towards a common EU asylum and immigration policy be called a security policy strategy...|$|R
