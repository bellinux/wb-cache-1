2500|$|Like SN2 {{reaction}}s, {{there are}} quite a few factors that affect the reaction rate of SN1 reactions. [...] Instead of having two concentrations that affect the reaction rate, there is only one, substrate. [...] The rate equation for this would be Rate=k. [...] Since the rate of a reaction is only determined by its slowest step, the rate at which the leaving group [...] "leaves" [...] determines the speed of the reaction. [...] This means that the better the leaving group, the faster the reaction rate. [...] A general rule for what makes a good leaving group is the weaker the conjugate base, the better the leaving group. [...] In this case, halogens are going to be the best leaving groups, while compounds such as amines, hydrogen, and alkanes are going to be quite poor leaving groups. [...] As SN2 reactions were affected by sterics, SN1 reactions are determined by bulky groups attached to the carbocation. [...] Since there is an intermediate that actually contains a positive charge, bulky groups attached <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> stabilize the charge on the carbocation through resonance and distribution of charge. [...] In this case, tertiary carbocation will react faster than a secondary which will react much faster than a primary. [...] It is also due to this carbocation intermediate that the product does not have to have inversion. [...] The nucleophile can attack from the top or the bottom and therefore create a racemic product. [...] It is important to use a protic solvent, water and alcohols, since an aprotic solvent could attack the intermediate and cause unwanted product. [...] It does not matter if the hydrogens from the protic solvent react with the nucleophile since the nucleophile is not involved in the rate determining step.|$|E
