25|$|Ford was {{renowned for}} his intense {{personality}} and his many idiosyncrasies and eccentricities. From the early Thirties onwards, he always wore dark {{glasses and a}} patch over his left eye, which was only partly to protect his poor eyesight. He was an inveterate pipe-smoker {{and while he was}} shooting he would chew on a linen handkerchief—each morning his wife would give him a dozen fresh handkerchiefs, {{but by the end of}} a day's filming the corners of all of them would be chewed to shreds. He always had music played on the set and would routinely break for tea (Earl Grey) at mid-afternoon every day during filming. He discouraged chatter and disliked bad language on set; its use, especially in front of <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>would</b> typically result in the offender being thrown off the production. He rarely drank during the making of a film, but when a production wrapped he would often lock himself in his study, wrapped only in a sheet, and go on a solitary drinking binge for several days, followed by routine contrition and a vow never to drink again. He was extremely sensitive to criticism and was always particularly angered by any comparison between his work and that of his older brother Francis. He rarely attended premieres or award ceremonies, although his Oscars and other awards were proudly displayed on the mantel in his home.|$|E

25|$|The Cerro de la Bufa is {{very close}} to the city of Guanajuato and has a number of stories {{associated}} with it. At sunset, there is a formation that looks like the profile of the face of a bearded man. According to tradition, this is the face of Christ. There are two caves consecrated to Ignatius of Loyola. There are {{on opposite sides of the}} summit and called the “old” and “new” cave. Each 31 of July, there is a pilgrimage to the “new” cave in honor of the saint. Sometime during the colonial period, an image of Ignatius was painted on a wall. According to legend, a group of male witches used to use the cave for their rites on the eve before the Catholic ritual, “forcing” the image on the wall to observe. The Cerro de la Bufa is home to another legend about an enchanted princess. It states that on feast days, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> appear to a man on a road in the mountain and ask him to carry her to the Basilica in the city center in his arms. If he did so, the city of Guanajuato would return to the height of its wealth. If he chose to do so, noises and threats from behind would haunt him. If he lost his resolve, the woman would turn into a serpent and kill him. No woman has ever been carried from this mountain to the Basilica.|$|E
500|$|Rumors about Isabeau's {{promiscuity}} flourished, which Adams {{attributes to}} English propaganda intended to secure England's grasp on the throne. An allegorical pamphlet, called Pastorelet, {{was published in}} the mid-1420s painting Isabeau and Orleans as lovers. During the same period Isabeau was contrasted with Joan of Arc, considered virginally pure, in the allegedly popular saying [...] "Even as France had been lost by a woman it would be saved by a woman". Adams writes that Joan of Arc has been attributed with the words [...] "France, having been lost by <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>would</b> be restored by a virgin", but neither saying can be substantiated by contemporary documentation or chronicles.|$|E
500|$|There is {{one notable}} {{instance}} where clear attribution {{is given to}} a woman, Bieiris de Romans (also given as Beatritz), but {{the subject of the}} poem is another woman, Na Maria.

This poem, if not clearly marked as by <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>would</b> be assumed to be by a man. Some controversy surrounds the works of the Bieiris de Romans, as scholars have suggested that her canso expresses [...] "lesbian desire." [...] The troubadour would typically speak to the domna (woman); the fact that the lyrical dialogue takes place exclusively between one woman and another is an extreme rarity.|$|E
5|$|As per the census, Zambia {{recorded}} a Total fertility rate (TFR), {{defined as the}} fertility rate of <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> throughout her life, of 5.9, with 7.0 in rural and 4.6 in urban areas. The most urbanized provinces, with higher socio-economic index like Lusaka {{recorded a}} lower TFR. Crude birth rate (CBR), the number of live births for each 1,000 births, stood at 35 in Zambia, with the Northern Province recording a maximum of 41. Child-woman ratio (CWR), the ratio of children aged 0–4 against women aged 15–49, was 738 children per thousand women and it was maximum in Northern province, where it was 880. The General fertility rate (GFR), the number of births per 1,000 child bearing women, was 147 as per the census. The Completed family Size (CF) was 6.4 in rural areas and 5.4 in urban areas.

500|$|Biller and {{executive}} producer Jeri Taylor were critical of Glassner's pitch; Biller {{found it to be}} [...] "very melodramatic and hokey", and Taylor called it [...] "a tired idea" [...] and [...] "too on the nose for B'Elanna." [...] Producer Brannon Braga explained that the decision to purchase the concept was to do a storyline involving an evil twin in the show's first season, and [...] "get it out of the way." [...] He did feel that the concept could be a mistake, and compared it negatively to a hypothetical storyline in which [...] character Data (Brent Spiner) would be made human.

500|$|Controversy {{regarding}} {{his involvement with}} JC's Girls threatened to lose Brown his church facility on the California Baptist University campus, but the church united in support of JC's Girls and remained in the same location. Barone said that Baptists might find viewing the JC's Girls website awkward, {{but that it was}} not intended for them. Stephen Clark of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "an edgy website [...] provocative appeals." [...] Sarah Sumner, author of Men and Women in the Church, said in Bill Day's 2008 documentary film The Pussycat Preacher that some Christians might oppose the female-led JC's Girls because of , a Bible verse that can be interpreted as restricting positions of authority in church to men. Brown said elsewhere in the film that it made more sense for women to lead JC's Girls [...] "because <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> be the most welcome in the industry".|$|E
500|$|The {{second part}} of the poem {{consists}} of a complaint about the evils of women in general. [...] The poem ends with a mythical example illustrating this point, after which the poem breaks off. [...] It is not certain whether the poem originally ended here: Lloyd-Jones thinks that the ending as it stands is too abrupt, and suggests {{that there may have been}} a number of other mythical examples following the one which is preserved; Leslie Schear disagrees, arguing that it is difficult to think of a mythical example from Greek mythology of a wife's treachery which can top that of Helen of Troy. [...] The fact that this general condemnation of women follows so closely on from the praise of the bee-woman at the end of the first part of the poem is perhaps intended to suggest that though such <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> be the ideal wife, she is a mirage; no real wives live up to the ideal bee-woman.|$|E

500|$|Elinor Mavor {{took over}} as editor in early 1979. She had worked for Bernhard as an {{illustrator}} and in the production department of several of his magazines, though not for Amazing. She had also been an editor at Bill of Fare, a restaurant trade magazine. Mavor had read {{a good deal of}} science fiction but knew nothing about the world of science fiction magazines when she took over. She was not confident that <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> be accepted as the editor of a science fiction magazine, so she initially used the pseudonym [...] "Omar Gohagen" [...] for both Amazing and Fantastic, dropping it late in 1980. Circulation continued to fall, and Bernhard refused to consider Mavor's request to undertake a subscription drive, which might have helped. Instead, in late 1980, Bernhard decided to merge the two magazines. Fantastics last independent issue was October 1980; thereafter the combined magazine returned to a bimonthly schedule. At the same time the title was changed to Amazing Science Fiction Stories. Bernhard cut Mavor's salary after the merger, as she was editing only one magazine. Despite this, she stayed with Amazing, but was unable to prevent circulation from dropping again, down to only 11,000 newsstand sales in 1982.|$|E
500|$|Don and Roger Sterling (John Slattery) {{meet with}} Rachel Menken (Maggie Siff), the Jewish {{owner of a}} large {{department}} store. Roger, feeling uncomfortable due to the novelty of having a Jewish client, enlists the only Jewish person in the company, {{a young man who}} works in the mailroom, to attend the meeting, disguised {{as a member of the}} art department, in order to make Rachel feel comfortable. Rachel, looking to attract wealthier customers, is disappointed by the agency's suggestions of coupons to attract frugal housewives. The meeting becomes heated, with Don angry that <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> talk to him in such a commanding way, and Rachel angry that the men will not respect her bold plans for the family business. A later meeting with executives from Lucky Strike tobacco company also appears to go badly, as Don still struggles to find a new approach to cigarette advertising. Pete suggests the [...] "death wish" [...] idea put forth by the company's research, but the executives reject his idea. Just when it seems that the meeting is over, Don comes up with a new tagline—"It's toasted!"—along with a strategy that ignores the question of health risks while extolling the virtues of the supposedly unique way that Lucky Strikes are prepared. The client is impressed, but Don is furious at Pete for literally fishing through Don's trash can to uncover and revive something Don had explicitly rejected.|$|E
500|$|Eberhardt {{relocated}} to Bône {{with her mother}} in May 1897. They initially lived with David and his wife, who both disapproved {{of the amount of}} time Eberhardt and her mother spent with Arabs. Eberhardt and her mother did not like the Davids' attitude, which was typical of European settlers in the area, and later avoided the country's French residents, renting an Arabic-style house far from the European quarter. Eberhardt, aware that a Muslim woman could go out neither alone nor unveiled, dressed as a man in a burnous and turban. She expanded on her previous studies of Arabic, and became fluent within a few months. She and her mother converted to Islam. Mackworth writes that while Eberhardt was a [...] "natural mystic", her conversion appeared to be largely for practical reasons, as it gave her greater acceptance among the Arabs. Eberhardt found it easy to accept Islam; Trophimowsky had brought her up as a fatalist and Islam gave her fatalism a meaning. She embraced the Islamic concept that everything is predestined and the will of God. Although Eberhardt largely devoted herself to the Muslim way of life, she frequently partook of marijuana and alcohol and had many lovers. According to a friend, Eberhardt [...] "drank more than a Legionnaire, smoked more kief than a hashish addict and made love for the love of making love". She was considered heterosexual, though approached sexual intercourse with a traditionally masculine attitude, often treating it as impersonal. The reason for her Arabic companions' tolerance of her lifestyle has been debated by biographers. According to Mackworth, the [...] "delicate courtesy of the Arabs" [...] led them to treat Eberhardt as a man because she wished to live as one. Eberhardt's behaviour made her an outcast with the French settlers and the colonial administration, who watched her closely. Seeing no reason as to why <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> choose the company of impoverished Arabs over her fellow Europeans, they eventually concluded she must be an English agent, sent to stir up resentment towards the French.|$|E

500|$|Fuller was {{an early}} proponent of {{feminism}} and especially believed in providing education to women. Once equal educational rights were afforded women, she believed, women could push for equal political rights as well. She advocated that women seek any employment they wish, rather than catering to the stereotypical [...] "feminine" [...] roles of the time, such as teaching. She once said, [...] "If you ask me what office women should fill, I reply—any... let them be sea captains if you will. I do not doubt that there are women well fitted for such an office". She had great confidence in all women but doubted that <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> produce a lasting work of art or literature in her time and disliked the popular female poets of her time. Fuller also warned women {{to be careful about}} marriage and not to become dependent on their husbands. As she wrote, [...] "I wish woman to live, first for God's sake. Then she will not make an imperfect man for her god, and thus sink to idolatry. Then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty". By 1832, she had made a personal commitment to stay single. Fuller also questioned a definitive line between male and female: [...] "There is no wholly masculine man... no purely feminine" [...] but that both were present in any individual. She suggested also that within a female were two parts: the intellectual side (which she called the Minerva) and the [...] "lyrical" [...] or [...] "Femality" [...] side (the Muse). She admired the work of Emanuel Swedenborg, who believed men and women shared [...] "an angelic ministry", as she wrote, as well as Charles Fourier, who placed [...] "Woman on an entire equality with Man". Unlike several contemporary women writers, including [...] "Mrs. Sigourney" [...] and [...] "Mrs. Stowe", she was familiarly referred to in a less formal manner as [...] "Margaret".|$|E
