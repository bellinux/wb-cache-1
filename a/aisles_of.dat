5|$|The <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> {{the choir}} {{previously}} both extended {{on either side}} of the Lady Chapel. The south aisle was shortened in about 1870 by George Gilbert Scott, and given an apsidal east end, becoming the chapel of StErasmus. The eastern end of the north aisle contains the chapel of St Werburgh.|$|E
5|$|The al-Aqsa Mosque {{has seven}} <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> {{hypostyle}} naves with several additional small halls {{to the west}} and east of the southern section of the building. There are 121 stained glass windows in the mosque from the Abbasid and Fatimid eras. About a fourth of them were restored in 1924.|$|E
5|$|The central nave is groin-vaulted, each bay being {{separated}} {{from one another}} by pointed transverse arches with rectangular profiles. The nave arcades are carried on cruciform piers with an engaged column on each face, sitting on a raised plinth. The two <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> the mosque are also groin-vaulted. Ibn Battuta noted that the Great Mosque had a white marble minbar ("pulpit"); it still exists today. There is a small mihrab in the mosque with an inscription dating from 1663, containing the name of Musa Pasha, a governor of Gaza during Ottoman rule.|$|E
25|$|In 1360, {{the west}} <b>aisle</b> <b>of</b> the south {{transept}} {{and the south}} <b>aisle</b> <b>of</b> the nave were widened, and the outer south aisle added. Also, at this time, the south porch and the tower were built.|$|R

5|$|Bishop John Innes (1407–14) contributed {{greatly to}} the {{rebuilding}} of the cathedral, {{as evidenced by the}} inscription on his tomb praising his efforts. When he died, the chapter met secretly—"in quadam camera secreta in campanili ecclesie Moraviensis"—and agreed that should one of their number be elected to the see, the bishop would grant one-third of the income of the bishopric annually until the rebuilding was finished. The major alterations to the west front were completed before 1435 and contain the arms of Bishop Columba de Dunbar (1422–35), and it is presumed that both the north and south <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> the choir were finished before 1460, as the south aisle contains the tomb of John de Winchester (1435–60). Probably the last important rebuilding feature was the major restructuring of the chapterhouse between 1482 and 1501, which contains the arms of Bishop Andrew Stewart.|$|E
5|$|The vault of {{the nave}} rises steeply {{in a simple}} quadripartite form, {{in harmony with the}} nave arcade. The eastern end of the choir was {{extended}} and the whole upper part elaborated {{in the second quarter of}} the 14th century by William Joy. The vault has a multiplicity of ribs in a net-like form, which is very different from that of the nave, and is perhaps a recreation in stone of a local type of compartmented wooden roof of which examples remain from the 15th century, including those at St Cuthbert's Church, Wells. The vaults of the <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> the choir also have a unique pattern.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fire}} of 1270, a {{programme}} of reconstruction was launched, with repairs and a major enlargement. Outer aisles {{were added to the}} nave, the eastern wing comprising the choir and presbytery was doubled in length and had aisles provided on its north and south sides, and the octagonal chapterhouse was built off the new north choir aisle (Figs. 8 & 9). The new northern and southern aisles ran the length of the choir, past the first bay of the presbytery, and contained recessed and chest tombs. The south aisle of the choir contained the tomb of bishop John of Winchester, suggesting a completion date for the reconstructed aisle between 1435 and 1460 (Fig. 10). Chapels were added to the new outer <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> the nave and were partitioned from each other with wooden screens. The first bay at the west end of each of these aisles and adjacent to the western towers did not contain a chapel but instead had an access door for the laity.|$|E

5|$|The {{church is}} built in red {{sandstone}} with a lead roof. The tower {{is within the}} body of the church with arches leading into the nave and the side aisles. These arches, together with the thin lancet windows and the flat buttresses, date from the 13thcentury. The authors of the Buildings of England series state that this early date is rare for towers in Cheshire. The upper parts of the tower, built after the collapse of 1757, are by William Baker in early Gothic Revival style. The nave has four bays, with north and south <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> six bays. The chancel has three bays with a vestry on its north side. The piers of the arcade date from the 13thcentury while the capitals are from the 19th-century restoration. The authors of the Buildings of England series state that {{the body of the}} church is mostly Perpendicular in style. At the east end of the north aisle is the Mainwaring chapel, which was originally a Lady Chapel; at {{the north side of the}} tower is the Dorfold chantry. Old stone seating remains around the sides of the church, which is unusual.|$|E
5|$|The range {{along the}} western curtain wall dates from about 1480, when the fourth earl remodelled the bailey. The great hall was the social hub of the castle, where the {{household}} gathered to eat. The now-ruined 15th-century building replaced an earlier hall on the same site, dating from about 1200, {{although some of the}} stone dates from the mid 12thcentury. The earl would have entered from the south from his connecting private chambers, and people of lower status through the Lion Tower. Internally, it was split into two <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> differing width. Both halls were heated by open hearths, two of which survive from the earlier hall. Opposite ends of the hall were for opposite ends of the social scale within the castle. The high end (next to the withdrawing chamber) was for the earl and his family, and the low end (next to the kitchen and other service rooms) {{for the rest of the}} household. In the medieval period, the great hall was richly decorated with tapestries.|$|E
25|$|The central nave, {{a sort of}} triumphal alley {{which leads}} to the mihrab, is {{significantly}} higher and wider than the other sixteen <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> the prayer hall. It is bordered on each side of a double row of arches rested on twin columns and surmounted by a carved plaster decoration consisting of floral and geometric patterns.|$|E

25|$|Of {{these three}} buildings, St. Paul's {{is the most}} {{derivative}} of other Victorian models, the arrangement of triple <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> almost equal height, each with an open timber roof is repeated {{many times in the}} work of Pugin and his followers. However, the window traceries, which are of the most complex of the three English styles and for which drawings still exist, display Blacket's mastery of Gothic design.|$|E

The leased Boeing 737-800 have no personal TV but overhead TV's located in the <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> the plane and feature a seat pitch of 29-30inches.

25|$|The {{improvements}} {{include the}} installation of a state-of-the-art Daktronics 16mm HD-ready video replay board in the north end zone, which replaced an older matrix messageboard, and digital 23mm LED ribbon displays {{along the edges of}} both upper decks, the north end zone, and the north tunnel entrances. Eight new concession stands were added, along with more than 60 new toilets in the women's restrooms, 30 new water fountains, handrails on all <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> the upper decks, new speakers in all restrooms, and a new public address system.|$|E
25|$|The nave {{is covered}} by barrel {{vaulting}} and has an upper, arched gallery (triforium). Light gets in through the rose windows of the West façade and transept, the narrow windows of the lateral <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> the nave {{as well as the}} windows of the lantern tower of the transept. The general plan of the cathedral is very {{similar to that of the}} Cathedral of Coimbra, which dates from the same period. One of the chapels of the ambulatory has an interesting Romanesque iron gate.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} rather narrow and {{consists}} of a nave and two side <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> the same height, unifying inner space as in a hall church, a characteristic that would be found in later Manueline spaces like the nave of the Jerónimos Monastery of Lisbon. Each pillar of the nave, supporting a pointed arch, is composed of three intertwined subcolumns in rough granite. These spiralling columns {{would also be a}} typical theme in later Manueline buildings, like the Guarda Cathedral. The side aisles are supported by semi-barrel vaults.|$|E

25|$|Of the façade by Alessandro Galilei (1735), the cliché {{assessment}} {{has ever}} been {{that it is the}} façade of a palace, not of a church. Galilei's front, which is a screen across the older front creating a narthex or vestibule, does express the nave and double <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> the archbasilica, which required a central bay wider {{than the rest of the}} sequence. Galilei provided it, without abandoning the range of identical arch-headed openings, by extending the central window by flanking columns that support the arch, in the familiar Serlian motif.|$|E
25|$|The first architect(s) of the church, most {{probably}} of French origin, followed {{the design of}} the Abbey of Clairvaux (now mostly demolished), which had been founded by Bernard of Clairvaux in 1115. The church is a Latin-cross building with pronounced transept arms and three aisles. The lateral <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> the nave are as high (20 metres) as the central one, which together with the relative slenderness of the church (17 metres) and large length (106 metres) conveys an impression of monumentality. Alcobaça remains, after 800 years, the largest Portuguese church. The vertical emphasis observed in the building is a typical gothic feature.|$|E
25|$|The structure, {{located in}} the northwestern corner of Dewan-e-Aam quadrangle, is typical of Mughal {{architecture}} of Shah Jahan's times. It is completely built of white marble that was brought from Makrana The façade is composed of cusped arches and engaged baluster columns with smooth and fine contours. The mosque has three superimposed domes, two <b>aisles</b> <b>of</b> five bays, and a slightly raised central pishtaq, or portal with a rectangular frame. This five-arched facade distinguishes it from other mosques of the similar class with three-arched facades. The interior is simple and plain {{with the exception of}} ceilings that are decorated and designed in four different orders, two arcuate, and two trabeated.|$|E
