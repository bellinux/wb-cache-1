Billboard posters, newspapers and magazines were employed in addition to motion pictures. Telemarketers were used to make phone calls with scripted dialogues to promote Harding.|$|E

Eight years later, the team was sold again, this time to a group led by New York <b>advertising</b> <b>executive</b> Art Modell.

The team subsequently reached the playoffs three times in the late 1980s, but fell short of playing in the Super Bowl, the inter-league championship game between the NFL and the rival American Football League (AFL) that started in 1966.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. had {{acquired}} {{over a thousand}} vessels during World War I, and still owned most of them when Harding took office. Congress had authorized their disposal in 1920, but the Senate would not confirm Wilson's nominees to the Shipping Board. Harding appointed Albert Lasker as its chairman; the <b>advertising</b> <b>executive</b> undertook to run the fleet as profitably as possible until it could be sold. Most ships proved impossible to sell at anything approaching the government's cost. Lasker recommended a large subsidy to the merchant marine to enable the sales, and Harding repeatedly urged Congress to enact it. Unpopular in the Midwest, the bill passed the House but was defeated by a filibuster in the Senate, and most government ships were eventually scrapped.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{issues with the}} {{promotion}} of the film: promotional material in the form of teaser posters created by Bob Peak, based on the Licence Revoked title and commissioned by Albert Broccoli, had been produced, but MGM decided against using them after American test screenings showed 'Licence Revoked' to be a common American phrase for the withdrawal of a driving licence. The delayed, corrected advertising by Steven Chorney, in the traditional style, limited the film's pre-release screenings. MGM also discarded a campaign created by <b>advertising</b> <b>executive</b> Don Smolen – who had worked in the publicity campaign for eight Bond films before – emphasising the rougher content of the movie.|$|E

5|$|Lester Burnham is {{a middle-aged}} <b>advertising</b> <b>executive</b> and {{magazine}} writer who despises his job. He is unhappily married to Carolyn, a neurotic yet fiercely ambitious {{real estate broker}} who grows red roses in their yard; their teenage daughter, Jane, abhors her parents and has low self-esteem. The Burnhams' new neighbors are the Fitts family, consisting of a homophobic retired U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Frank Fitts, his near-catatonic wife, Barbara, and their teenage son, Ricky, who constantly films his surroundings with a camcorder, collecting hundreds of recordings on videotapes in his bedroom. His part-time job as a bar caterer and waiter serves as a front for his secret marijuana dealings. Frank is a strict disciplinarian who previously sent Ricky to a military school and briefly committed him to a psychiatric hospital. Jim Olmeyer and Jim Berkley, a gay couple who live nearby, welcome the Fitts family to the neighborhood. On the way to school, Frank reveals his homophobia while he angrily discusses the incident with Ricky.|$|E
5|$|The song has two {{different}} themes. It primarily {{talks about the}} romance and later marriage between the film's two main characters Darrin (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Lilly (played by Beyoncé), as well as subtly hinting at Beyoncé's real-life relationship with rapper Jay-Z. Darrin, a shallow New York <b>advertising</b> <b>executive,</b> traveled to {{a small town in}} the deep south upon receiving word that his aunt has died and left him a sizable inheritance. Once in town, Darrin is informed that he will only receive the money if he successfully leads a local gospel group to victory at an upcoming competition. Reluctant but strapped for cash, Darrin takes on the task of finding the best singers in town and shaping the group up. Along the way, he becomes acclimated to the town {{with the help of his}} cousin Lucius (played by Mike Epps) and meets Lilly, a single mother who not only possesses an incredible voice but also the ability to warm Darrin's cold heart. Although Gooding's character, Darrin, was in love with Beyoncé's character, Lilly, the latter did not always feel the same until later on in the film. Near the end of the film, he proposes to her and she accepts. They eventually get married (offscreen) and within eighteen months they had a baby son together, making Darrin a father and also stepfather to Lilly's other son.|$|E
