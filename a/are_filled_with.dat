5|$|Incandescent lights <b>are</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> argon, to {{preserve}} the filaments at high temperature from oxidation. It {{is used for the}} specific way it ionizes and emits light, such as in plasma globes and calorimetry in experimental particle physics. Gas-discharge lamps filled with pure argon provide lilac/violet light; with argon and some mercury, blue light. Argon is also used for blue and green argon-ion lasers.|$|E

5|$|The asci {{are roughly}} {{cylindrical}} {{with a long}} stem-like base; the entire ascus is often as long as 300–325µm and about 15µm in diameter at the thickest point.

40|$|Fifth-generation poly(propylene imine) dendrimers, {{modified}} with 64 apolar adamantyl groups, {{have been}} immobilized on cyclodextrin host monolayers (molecular printboards) on glass by supramolecular microcontact printing. The immobilized dendrimers retain their guest-binding properties and function as molecular boxes that can <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> fluorescent dye molecules from solution. Alternatively, {{part of the}} immobilized dendrimers <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> dye molecules by cross-microcontact printing while the remaining, empty dendrimers <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a different dye from solution, resulting in alternating patterns of dye molecules. In addition, we demonstrate that encapsulation of dyes in immobilized dendrimers is reversible: immobilized molecular boxes can <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a dye, emptied, and subsequently refilled with a different dye...|$|R

There are a total of 129 rooms and most <b>are</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> various objects, such as moveable platforms, static hazards such as spikes and hostile aliens. As well as executing well-timed manoeuvres and jumps, the player is able to use starship props to block or defend themselves. Another feature is the use of remote controlled drones, which can be directed by Alien 8 into inaccessible or dangerous areas.|$|E

5|$|Fairly {{inactive}} in nature, the Japanese sleeper ray {{spends much}} of its time lying buried on the sea floor. It can produce an electric shock of 30–80 volts to ward off predators, which include the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). Its electric organs are composed of electrocytes, which are specialized cells derived from muscle fibers that <b>are</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a jelly-like substance. These electrocytes are stacked in vertical columns, with many columns making up each electric organ; this arrangement functions essentially like batteries connected in parallel. The diet of the Japanese sleeper ray includes benthic invertebrates. A parasite of this species is the tapeworm Anteropora japonica (Yamaguti, 1934) Subhapradha, 1955.|$|E
5|$|Many of Riley's poems <b>are</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> musical references. Riley had no musical education, {{and could}} not read sheet music, but learned from his father how to play guitar, and from a friend how to play violin. He {{performed}} in two different local bands, and became so proficient on the violin {{he was invited to}} play with a group of adult Freemasons at several events. A few of his later poems were set to music and song, one of the most well known being A Short'nin' Bread Song—Pieced Out.|$|E

5|$|Most bats are homeothermic, the {{exception}} being the Vespertilionidae, the Rhinolophidae and the Miniopteridae which extensively use heterothermy. Compared to other mammals, bats {{have a high}} thermal conductivity. Body heat is mainly lost through the wings as they <b>are</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> blood vessels, {{but they may be}} used as an insulator while resting. By wrapping their wings around themselves, they can trap a layer of still air around themselves. Smaller bats generally have a higher metabolic rate than larger bats, and so need to consume more food in order to maintain homeothermy.|$|E
5|$|Most cnidarians prey on organisms {{ranging in}} size from {{plankton}} to animals several times larger than themselves, but many obtain much of their nutrition from dinoflagellates, and a few are parasites. Many are preyed on by other animals including starfish, sea slugs, fish, turtles, and even other cnidarians. Many scleractinian corals—which form the structural foundation for coral reefs—possess polyps that <b>are</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> symbiotic photo-synthetic zooxanthellae. While reef-forming corals are almost entirely restricted to warm and shallow marine waters, other cnidarians can be found at great depths, in polar regions, and in freshwater.|$|E
5|$|Salkin {{had noted}} that its {{tropical}} position might mean that B.dentata {{was a key}} species in the transition from rainforest to open habitat in the ancestry of the genus. One adaptation to a drier sunnier climate was a thick intermediate layer under the epidermis in the leaf architecture. This layer, the hypodermis, contains large vacuoles that <b>are</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a phenolic compound, and seems to serve to reduce the intensity of sunlight reaching the mesophyll.|$|E

There are abundant cheilocystidia on the gill edges. They measure 30–50 by 7–12µm, and are fusoid-ventricose, with tips that are broadly rounded. They <b>are</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a purplish sap and have granular contents. The cap tissue comprises a well-differentiated cuticle, a distinct hypoderm, and a filamentous tramal body. Clamp connections in the hyphae are rare or absent.|$|E
