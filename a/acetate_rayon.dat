50|$|Although Heal Fabrics {{were her}} {{principal}} client, Lucienne also designed textiles for Liberty’s and British Celanese, whose <b>acetate</b> <b>rayon</b> fabrics were marketed by Sanderson during the mid 1950s. She also renewed her earlier associations with Edinburgh Weavers and Cavendish Textiles. Her dress fabrics {{for the latter}} were sold through the John Lewis Partnership.|$|E
50|$|Acetobacter aceti is {{economically}} {{important because}} it {{is used in the}} production of vinegar by converting the ethanol in wine into acetic acid. The acetic acid created by A. aceti is also used in the manufacturing of <b>acetate</b> <b>rayon,</b> plastics production, rubber production, and photographic chemicals. A. aceti is considered an acidophile, which means it is able to survive in acidic environments, due to having an acidified cytoplasm which makes nearly all proteins in the genome to evolve acid stability. A. aceti has become important in helping to understand the process by which proteins can attain acid stability.|$|E

Wood pulp is widely used to make paper, paperboard, cellulose sponges, cellophane and some important plastics and textiles, such as cellulose <b>acetate</b> and <b>rayon.</b> Bamboo stems also have hundreds of uses, including paper, buildings, furniture, boats, musical instruments, fishing poles, water pipes, plant stakes, and scaffolding. Trunks of palm trees and tree ferns are often used for building. Stems of Reed are an important building material for use in thatching in some areas.|$|R

5000|$|Some American {{intelligence}} offices {{visited the}} UK in 1942 to be {{briefed on the}} British efforts in [...] "escape and evasion" [...] techniques and equipment. The British MI9 gave the Americans a book or manual, called, [...] "Per Ardua Libertas", to take back to the US. Published in this manual were examples of each cloth escape and tissue escape map that the British had produced. [...] "After this meeting with the British, the United States began to produce its own escape maps." [...] Most of the American maps supplied by the Army Map Service from World War II were actually printed on <b>rayon</b> <b>acetate</b> materials, and not silk. However, because of the silky texture of the materials, they were referred to by the more familiar textile name.|$|R
5000|$|The {{solubility}} of nitrocellulose {{in organic}} solvents such as ether and acetone {{was the basis}} for the first [...] "artificial silk" [...] by Georges Audemars in about 1855. Commercial production started in 1891, but the result was flammable and more expensive than cellulose <b>acetate</b> or cuprammonium <b>rayon.</b> Because of this expense, production ceased early in the 1900s. Nitrocellulose was briefly known as [...] "mother-in-law silk". Frank Hastings Griffin invented the double-godet, a special stretch-spinning process that changed artificial silk to rayon, rendering it usable in many industrial products such as tire cords and clothing. Nathan Rosenstein invented the [...] "spunize process" [...] by which he turned rayon from a hard fiber to a fabric. This allowed rayon to become a popular raw material in textiles.|$|R

40|$|Soft {{independent}} {{modeling of}} class analogy (SIMCA) {{was successful in}} classifying a large library of 758 commercially available, non-blended samples of <b>acetate,</b> cotton, polyester, <b>rayon,</b> silk and wool 89 %- 98 % of the time at the 95 % confidence level (p = 0. 05 significance level). In the present study, cotton and silk had a 62 % and 24 % chance, respectively, of being classified with their own group and also with rayon. SIMCA correctly identified a counterfeit “silk ” sample as po-lyester. When coupled with diffuse NIR reflectance spectroscopy and a large sample library, SIMCA shows considerable promise as a quick, non-destructive, multivariate method for fiber identifica-tion. A major advantage is simplicity. No sample pretreatment of any kind was required, and no adjustments were made for fiber origin, manufacturing process residues, topical finishes, weave pattern, or dye content. Increasing the sample library should make the models more robust and improve identification rates over those reported in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the resin {{treatment}} of a blended fabric with <b>acetate</b> and viscose <b>rayon,</b> especially {{in the light of}} an improved method of “Pre-heating & Quenching. ” 	The authors tried to investigate the mode of distribution of applied resins on the component fibers, and to elucidate how it affected on each, contributing to the altimate properties of the fabric which was obtained as an algebraic sum of the effects or as a creation of a new effect. 	After preliminary establishing a standard process of resin treatment, including “Pre-heating & Quenching”, with 50 / 50 viscose and acetate blend samples were prepared. And those items, the crease recovery angle, the strength & elongation, the knot strength and elongation, resin contents and their distribution on each component fiber were studied. 	Although the present stage in but a preliminary some interesting facts, how the resins in each component comtributed to or detracted from crease recovery, have already been revealed...|$|R
5000|$|Many slips have floral lace at the hem {{and/or the}} [...] "vents" [...] or [...] "sideslits". Some {{of the older}} slips have decorations, such as a {{butterfly}} or flowers sewn {{into the fabric of}} the slip, and a pillowtab was also added to the waistband of a waist slip. The vast majority of slips are made of 100% nylon, while others are made from polyester, <b>rayon,</b> <b>acetate,</b> silk or in some cases cotton. Still, there are others made of blends, and the label of the garment might read, for example, [...] "40% nylon, 35% rayon, 25% polyester". Nylon slips are often shiny in appearance, and are very smooth to the touch, while polyester slips can even be more shiny with a real slippery feel, especially charmeuse or [...] "satin" [...] slips. Although charmeuse slips have very attractive eye appeal, they are not as durable as nylon slips, and often tear very easily, especially when wet.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 With the {{increased}} variety {{and use of}} lining fabrics, consumers have become concerned over choices for lining fabrics which have good serviceability properties. The major {{purpose of this study}} was to secure some information on the physical properties of lining fabrics to help consumers in the selection of lining fabrics which will give good serviceability. Eight lining fabrics made of one fiber [...] two fabrics each of cotton, <b>rayon,</b> <b>acetate</b> and polyester [...] were examined for their serviceability properties such as resistance to abrasion, breaking load and elongation of yarn and fabric, tearing strength, resistance to yarn slippage, dimensional stability and resistance to wrinkling. They were all white, plain weave, light-weight and commonly-sold lining fabrics. The experimental fabrics were analyzed for their basic characteristics such as fabric count, weight, thickness, twist and yarn number to find out the possible relationship which existed between these characteristics and the serviceability properties. Standard test methods of the American Society for Testing Materials and the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists were conducted under the standard atmospheric conditions. Analysis of variance and correlation coefficients were calculated for data obtained from all tests. Lining fabrics were ranked in terms of fiber content for each fabric performance test. Polyester showed great resistance to abrasion, high yarn and fabric breaking strength and little dimensional change. Rayon showed great resistance to tearing and good yarn and fabric breaking strength. Cotton had good resistance to abrasion and the least yarn slippage at the seams. Acetate consistently ranked the lowest in the majority of serviceability tests. Since linings with different fiber components did not always rank in the same order in all tests, it would be desirable for the consumer to determine what serviceability qualities she desires most...|$|R
