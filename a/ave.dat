25|$|The <b>Ave</b> Regina Caelorum (Hail, Queen of Heaven) is {{an early}} Marian antiphon, praising Mary, the Queen of Heaven. It is {{traditionally}} said or sung after each of the canonical hours of the Liturgy of the Hours.

It is prayed from the Feast of the Presentation (February 2) through the Wednesday of Holy Week. It used to be sung on {{the feast of the}} Assumption of Mary. The <b>Ave</b> Regina Caelorum dates back in a different musical intonation to the 12th century. Today's version is slightly different from a 12th-century intonation. The <b>Ave</b> Regina Caelorum has four parts: <b>Ave,</b> Salve, Gaude and Vale (in English: hail, rejoice, farewell). It was used for processions in honour of the Queen of Heaven. The <b>Ave</b> Regina Caelorum received numerous musical versions, a famous one of which was composed in 1773 by Joseph Haydn.|$|E

40|$|The {{origin of}} birds (<b>Aves)</b> {{is one of}} the great {{evolutionary}} transitions. Fossils show that many unique morphological features of modern birds, such as feathers, reduction in body size, and the semilunate carpal, long preceded the origin of clade <b>Aves,</b> but some may be unique to <b>Aves,</b> such as relative elongation of the forelimb. We study the evolution of body size and forelimb length across the phylogeny of coelurosaurian theropods and Mesozoic <b>Aves.</b> Using recently developed phylogenetic comparative methods, we find an increase in rates of body size and body size dependent forelimb evolution leading to small body size relative to forelimb length in Paraves, the wider clade comprising <b>Aves</b> and Deinonychosauria. The high evolutionary rates arose primarily from a reduction in body size, as there were no increased rates of forelimb evolution. In line with a recent study, we find evidence that <b>Aves</b> appear to have a unique relationship between body size and forelimb dimensions. Traits associated with <b>Aves</b> evolved before their origin, at high rates, and support the notion that numerous lineages of paravians were experimenting with different modes of flight through the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous...|$|R
