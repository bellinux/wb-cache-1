5|$|The most {{important}} oxide is TiO2, which exists in three important polymorphs; <b>anatase,</b> brookite, and rutile. All {{of these are}} white diamagnetic solids, although mineral samples can appear dark (see rutile). They adopt polymeric structures in which Ti is surrounded by six oxide ligands that link to other Ti centers.|$|E
5|$|All three stable {{elements}} {{occur in}} heavy mineral sands ore deposits, which are placer deposits formed, most usually in beach environments, by concentration {{due to the}} specific gravity of the mineral grains of erosion material from mafic and ultramafic rock. The titanium minerals are mostly <b>anatase</b> and rutile, and zirconium occurs in the mineral zircon. Because of the chemical similarity, up to 5% of the zirconium in zircon is replaced by hafnium. The largest producers of the group 4 elements are Australia, South Africa and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Hydrothermal {{alteration}} {{of the central}} lava dome and iron-bearing deposits has generated alunite, <b>anatase,</b> chlorite, copper veinlets, gypsum, illite, jarosite, labradorite, quartz, rutile, sanidine, smectite, and sulfur. Some of these minerals forms veins inside the rock. Silification is prominent and has formed cristobalite and tridymite. Elemental sulfur is also found. Vast regions of the volcano have been altered hydrothermally at temperatures of , giving the rock a clear appearance. Minor exhalation deposits are {{also found in the}} form of sulfates that sometimes conserve conduits. Red-coloured alteration halos occur in andesites adjacent to iron deposits, probably due to iron input.|$|E
5|$|Common titanium-containing {{minerals}} are <b>anatase,</b> brookite, ilmenite, perovskite, rutile, and titanite (sphene). Akaogiite is {{an extremely}} rare mineral consisting of titanium dioxide. Of these minerals, only rutile and ilmenite have economic importance, yet even they are difficult to find in high concentrations. About 6.0 and 0.7 million tonnes of those minerals were mined in 2011, respectively. Significant titanium-bearing ilmenite deposits exist in western Australia, Canada, China, India, Mozambique, New Zealand, Norway, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Ukraine. About 186,000 tonnes of titanium metal sponge were produced in 2011, mostly in China (60,000 t), Japan (56,000 t), Russia (40,000 t), United States (32,000 t) and Kazakhstan (20,700 t). Total reserves of titanium are estimated to exceed 600 million tonnes.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>anatase</b> and rutile TiO2 can intercalate cations, {{acting as}} anode {{material}} in Li-ion batteries and Na-ion batteries.|$|E
25|$|Titanium dioxide, {{particularly}} in the <b>anatase</b> form, exhibits photocatalytic activity under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. This photoactivity is reportedly most pronounced at the {001} planes of <b>anatase,</b> although the {101} planes are thermodynamically more stable and thus more prominent in most synthesised and natural <b>anatase,</b> as evident by the often observed tetragonal dipyramidal growth habit. Interfaces between rutile and <b>anatase</b> are further considered to improve photocatalytic activity by facilitating charge carrier separation and as a result, biphasic titanium dioxide is often considered to possess enhanced functionality as a photocatalyst. It {{has been reported that}} titanium dioxide, when doped with nitrogen ions or doped with metal oxide like tungsten trioxide, exhibits excitation also under visible light.

It can also oxidize oxygen or organic materials directly. Hence, in addition to its use as a pigment, titanium dioxide can be added to paints, cements, windows, tiles, or other products for its sterilizing, deodorizing and anti-fouling properties and is used as a hydrolysis catalyst. It is also used in dye-sensitized solar cells, which are a type of chemical solar cell (also known as a Graetzel cell).|$|E
25|$|In 1991, McCrone visited Yale to take new microsamples {{from the}} map, partly {{to check his}} earlier results, and partly to apply new techniques. Photomicrographs taken at 1 {{micrometer}} intervals through the thickness of ink samples demonstrated that the manufactured <b>anatase</b> particles were not just sticking to the surface as Cahill's criticisms had implied, and Fourier transform spectroscopy identified the ink's binder as gelatin, probably made from animal skin. In July 2002, using Raman spectroscopy, the presence of significant quantities of <b>anatase</b> in the map ink was confirmed by British researchers Katherine Brown and Robin Clark, and the remaining traces of black pigment in the ink were found to consist essentially of soot-type carbon.|$|E
25|$|As one example, Pauling {{considered}} the three mineral forms of titanium dioxide, {{each with a}} coordination number of 6 for the Ti4+ cations. The most stable (and most abundant) form is rutile, in which the coordination octahedra are arranged so that each one shares only two edges (and no faces) with adjoining octahedra. The other two, less stable, forms are brookite and <b>anatase,</b> in which each octahedron shares three and four edges respectively with adjoining octahedra.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, {{with new}} {{technology}} becoming available, Yale sent the map for chemical analysis by forensic specialist Walter McCrone whose team, {{using a variety}} of techniques, found that the yellowish lines contain <b>anatase</b> (titanium dioxide) in a rounded crystalline form manufactured for use in pale pigments since the 1920s, indicating that the ink was modern. They also confirmed that the ink contained only trace amounts of iron, and that the black line remnants were on top of the yellow, indicating that they were not the remains of a penciled guide-line, as the British Museum staff had speculated.|$|E
25|$|Rutile is {{the second}} most {{abundant}} mineral sand. Rutile found in primary rock cannot be extracted hence the deposits containing rutile sand can be mined meaning a reduced availability to the high concentration ore. Crude titanium dioxide (in the form of rutile or synthetic rutile) is purified via converting to titanium tetrachloride in the chloride process. In this process, the crude ore (containing at least 70% TiO2) is reduced with carbon, oxidized with chlorine to give titanium tetrachloride; i.e., carbothermal chlorination. This titanium tetrachloride is distilled, and re-oxidized in a pure oxygen flame or plasma at 1500–2000K to give pure titanium dioxide while also regenerating chlorine. Aluminium chloride is often added to the process as a rutile promotor; the product is mostly <b>anatase</b> in its absence. The preferred raw material for the chloride process is natural rutile because of its high titanium dioxide content.|$|E

25|$|Fly ash {{material}} solidifies while {{suspended in}} the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags. Since the particles solidify rapidly while {{suspended in the}} exhaust gases, fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and {{range in size from}} 0.5 µm to 300µm. The major consequence of the rapid cooling is that few minerals have time to crystallize, and that mainly amorphous, quenched glass remains. Nevertheless, some refractory phases in the pulverized coal do not melt (entirely), and remain crystalline. In consequence, fly ash is a heterogeneous material. SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and occasionally CaO are the main chemical components present in fly ashes. The mineralogy of fly ashes is very diverse. The main phases encountered are a glass phase, together with quartz, mullite and the iron oxides hematite, magnetite and/or maghemite. Other phases often identified are cristobalite, anhydrite, free lime, periclase, calcite, sylvite, halite, portlandite, rutile and <b>anatase.</b> The Ca-bearing minerals anorthite, gehlenite, akermanite and various calcium silicates and calcium aluminates identical to those found in Portland cement can be identified in Ca-rich fly ashes.|$|E

500|$|The {{potential}} of X-ray crystallography {{for determining the}} structure of molecules and minerals—then only known vaguely from chemical and hydrodynamic experiments—was realized immediately. The earliest structures were simple inorganic crystals and minerals, but even these revealed fundamental laws of physics and chemistry. The first atomic-resolution structure to be [...] "solved" [...] (i.e., determined) in 1914 was that of table salt. The distribution of electrons in the table-salt structure showed that crystals are not necessarily composed of covalently bonded molecules, and proved the existence of ionic compounds. The structure of diamond was solved in the same year, proving the tetrahedral arrangement of its chemical bonds and showing that the length of C–C single bond was 1.52 angstroms. Other early structures included copper, calcium fluoride (CaF2, also known as fluorite), calcite (CaCO3) and pyrite (FeS2) in 1914; spinel (MgAl2O4) in 1915; the rutile and <b>anatase</b> forms of titanium dioxide (TiO2) in 1916; pyrochroite Mn(OH)2 and, by extension, brucite Mg(OH)2 in 1919;. Also in 1919 sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and caesium dichloroiodide (CsICl2) were determined by Ralph Walter Graystone Wyckoff, and the wurtzite (hexagonal ZnS) structure became known in 1920.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005 a {{team from}} the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, led by Dr. René Larsen, studied the map and its {{accompanying}} manuscripts to make recommendations on {{the best ways to}} preserve the centuries-old parchment.

A few months earlier, Kirsten Seaver had suggested that a forger could have found two separate blank leaves in the original [...] "Speculum Historiale" [...] volume, from which the first few dozen pages appeared to be missing, and joined them together with the binding strip. On the other hand, at the International Conference on the History of Cartography in July 2009, Larsen revealed that his team had continued their investigation after publishing their original report, and he told the press that [...] "All the tests that we have done {{over the past five years}} — on the materials and other aspects — do not show any signs of forgery". The formal report of his presentation shows that his work ignores rather than contradicts earlier studies. For example, he experimented only with artificial wormholes, and did not follow up the observation made at the 1966 Conference, that live bookworms were a known tool of the fake antiquities trade. Similarly, he claimed that the <b>anatase</b> in the ink could have come from sand used to dry it (the hypothetical source of the sand being gneiss from the Binnenthal area of Switzerland) but his team had not examined the crystals microscopically, and Kenneth Towe responded that this was an essential test, given that crystal size and shape should clearly distinguish commercial <b>anatase</b> from <b>anatase</b> found in sand.|$|E
