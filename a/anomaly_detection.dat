40|$|Abstract—Sensor nodes in {{wireless}} sensor {{networks have}} limited energy resources and this hinders the dissemination of the gathered data to a central location. This stimulated our research {{to make use of}} the limited computational capabilities of these sensor nodes to build a normal model of the data gathered. Hence by having the normal model, anomalies can then be detected and forwarded to a central location. This process is done locally in the sensor nodes and hence reduces the power consumption used in transmitting all the data. Our algorithm is an enhanced version of the Data Capture <b>Anomalies</b> <b>Detection</b> Algorithm; which is used to compute a local model of the normal data in {{wireless sensor networks}}. In this paper the Data Capture <b>Anomalies</b> <b>Detection</b> is used to partition the data and then send all the data to a central server for data classification, building on the Data Capture <b>Anomalies</b> <b>Detection</b> method and in order to classify the partitioned data; our algorithm Two-Layered Data Capture <b>Anomalies</b> <b>Detection</b> sends <b>anomalies</b> (2 %) as well as roughly (2 % or 4 %) of normal data for further data processing and classification purposes. Experimental results on synthetic data show that Two-Layered Data Capture <b>Anomalies</b> <b>Detection</b> is able to provide promising results.
