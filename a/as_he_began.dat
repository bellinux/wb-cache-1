5|$|By 1909 Keynes had {{published}} his first professional economics {{article in the}} Economics Journal, {{about the effect of}} a recent global economic downturn on India. He founded the Political Economy Club, a weekly discussion group. Also in 1909, Keynes accepted a lectureship in economics funded personally by Alfred Marshall. Keynes's earnings rose further <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> to take on pupils for private tuition.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Hunter {{began to}} make a series of trips to {{mainland}} Europe, where he visited Paris, Venice, Florence and the Riviera. Fergusson accompanied him {{on a number of}} these visits. Hunter's visits abroad produced a large number of paintings and his style changed noticeably in this period of European travel <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> using dabs of colour placed instinctively to portray underlying form.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> {{the third}} orbit, Schirra {{disconnected}} the spacecraft's gyroscopes, turned off {{part of the}} electrical power system, and let the capsule drift. He took advantage of this quiet period to test his spatial awareness and motor control, which he found was broadly unaffected by weightlessness, and to eat a light meal. He powered the spacecraft back up over the Indian Ocean, and continued over the Pacific. At Hawaii, he was given clearance for a full six-orbit mission, and as he crossed over towards California shut down the electrical power for a second period of drifting flight, during which he occupied himself taking photographs with the onboard camera.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> to {{read up on}} {{the written}} {{accounts}} of cultural cannibalism, {{he was struck by}} inconsistencies and other problems in these tales. In search of reliable accounts from anthropologists who had witnessed the practice of cultural cannibalism first-hand, he placed an advertisement in the newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, but again failed to come up with any first-hand documented cases. Prior to its publication, rumors had circulated in the anthropological community that Arens was putting together a book that would challenge the concept of cultural cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|For two years, Bahá'u'lláh {{lived alone}} in the {{mountains}} of Kurdistan. He originally lived as a hermit, dressed like a dervish and used the name Darvish Muhammad-i-Irani. At one point someone noticed his penmanship, which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local Sufi orders. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> to take guests, he became noted for his learning and wisdom. Shaykh `Uthmán, Shaykh `Abdu'r-Rahmán, and Shaykh Ismá'íl, leaders of the Naqshbandíyyih, Qádiríyyih, and Khálidíyyih Orders respectively, began to seek his advice. It was to the second of these that the Four Valleys was written. Bahá'u'lláh wrote several other notable books during this time.|$|E

5|$|He {{joined the}} Lodge of Antiquity in London in 1863, and {{that same year}} became Grand Chaplain of United Grand Lodge. While still Rector of Swillington, his new masonic duties {{took him to the}} consecration of many new lodges, and saw him deliver the oration at the laying of the {{foundation}} stone for the new extension to Freemason's Hall in Great Queen Street, London, the next year. In the same period, Woodford started to contribute articles on masonic history, starting with his researches into the old York lodges. He became known to local booksellers <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> to collect old manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{remained}} {{active in}} the Democratic party after his 1880 defeat and began stumping on behalf of other candidates and helping to organize party rallies across the state. His speeches were noted for their partisanship, but his rhetoric gradually shifted away from a conservative viewpoint in the 1890s <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> to identify himself with the growing progressive movement. He {{became a member of}} the state Democratic Central Committee in 1904, a position that raised his popularity and influence in the party.|$|E
5|$|Rathbone {{jumped from}} his seat and {{struggled}} with Booth, who dropped the pistol and drew a knife, then stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm. Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as Booth prepared to jump from the box to the stage, a twelve-foot drop; Booth's riding spur became entangled on the Treasury flag decorating the box, and he landed awkwardly on his left foot. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> crossing the stage, many in the audience thought {{he was part of}} the play.|$|E

Near the end of the match, Bigelow and the Headshrinkers each climbed the turnbuckles to attempt simultaneous diving headbutts, but Tatanka rolled out of the way. Tatanka seized the opportunity and pinned Samu for the win.|$|E
5|$|They {{then changed}} the line-up with Ed Lay {{replacing}} Geraint Owen on drums <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> {{to focus on}} his Welsh band The Heights. Under this lineup they became known as Snowfield. They played their debut gig under this name {{at the request of}} Fused Magazine in March 2003. The following summer the band self-released a demo six-track EP, all of which went on to become future Editors songs. Then, as it was the home of their management and the nearest big city, the band relocated to Birmingham after graduation in the autumn of 2003.|$|E
5|$|Titian was a {{personal}} friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death. Ottavio excelled as a military commander and was awarded the Golden Fleece by the emperor. While the post had been given {{as a means to}} strengthen the family position, it did not come without cost. His success bred resentment amongst his family, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> to see himself unaccountable to Rome.|$|E
5|$|In autumn, Granpa and Emily went fishing, and {{imagined}} of catching a whale that haled {{them through the}} Thames and through London.

5|$|While in Egypt, Zoghby {{considered}} {{the issues of}} ecumenism and the schism between the Melkite Catholic and Antiochian Orthodox Churches. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> to study both the historical roots of the separation and the modern divisions of Middle Eastern churches {{he came to the}} opinion that the schism was unjustifiable. He also began to question the domination of the so-called Uniate churches by the See of Rome. Zoghby, along with other Melkite priests in Egypt such as George Hakim and Joseph Tawil, were influenced by Father Oreste Karame, who advocated the need for the Melkite Church to return to its proper traditions and work for communion with the Orthodox Church.|$|E
5|$|Bolstered by {{publicity}} stunts, Land of the Soviets was {{a commercial}} success in Belgium, and also witnessed serialisation in France and Switzerland. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in the Congo, and the series became a defining {{part of the}} Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Damage to the original plates prevented republication of the book for several decades, while Hergé later expressed embarrassment at the crudeness of the work. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> to redraw his earlier Adventures in second, colour versions from 1942 onward, he decided against doing so for Land of the Soviets; {{it was the only}} completed Tintin story that Hergé did not reproduce in colour. Growing demand among fans of the series resulted in the production of unauthorised copies of the book in the 1960s, with the first officially sanctioned republication appearing in 1969, after which it was translated into several other languages, including English. Critical reception of the work has been largely negative, with commentators on The Adventures of Tintin describing it as one of Hergé's weakest works.|$|E
5|$|During Middleton's {{tenure at}} LSU the {{presidency}} of the university changed hands from President Atkinson to President James Monroe Smith, the latter an appointee of Governor Long. Towards the end of Middleton's fourth year on campus President Smith asked him if he would stay on for an additional year and also become Dean of Men. Middlteon responded that he would accept, but it had to be cleared through the War Department. Smith's request to the War Department for both the extension and the deanship for Middleton were approved. Toward the end of the fifth year Smith went a step further, suggesting that Middleton retire from the army and become a permanent member of the LSU staff. Middleton would not even consider retirement, but accepted a sixth year with the ROTC program. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> his sixth year on campus, on 1 Aug 1935, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.|$|E

5|$|Following his graduation, Clark {{worked in}} Washington, D.C., from July 1983 to 1984 {{in the offices}} of the Chief and Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the United States Army, earning a second Legion of Merit for his work. He then served as the Operations Group {{commander}} at the Fort Irwin Military Reservation from August 1984 to June 1986. He was awarded another Legion of Merit and a Meritorious Service Medal for his work at Fort Irwin and was given a brigade command at Fort Carson in 1986. He commanded the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division there from April 1986 to March 1988. Veneta Clark, Wesley's mother, fell ill <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> this command and died on Mother's Day in 1986. After Fort Carson, Clark returned to the Command and General Staff College to direct and further develop the Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) there until October 1989. The BCTP was created to teach senior officers war-fighting skills, according to the commanding general at the time. On November 1, 1989, Clark was promoted to brigadier general.|$|E
5|$|Himmler's organised, bookish intellect {{served him}} well <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> setting up {{different}} SS departments. In 1931 he appointed Reinhard Heydrich chief of the new Ic Service (intelligence service), which was renamed the Sicherheitsdienst (SD: Security Service) in 1932. He later officially appointed Heydrich his deputy. The two men had a good working relationship and a mutual respect. In 1933, they began to remove the SS from SA control. Along with Interior Minister Frick, they hoped to create a unified German police force. In March 1933, Reich Governor of Bavaria Franz Ritter von Epp appointed Himmler chief of the Munich Police. Himmler appointed Heydrich commander of Department IV, the political police. That same year, Hitler promoted Himmler {{to the rank of}} SS-Obergruppenführer, equal in rank to the senior SA commanders. Thereafter, Himmler and Heydrich took over the political police of state after state; soon only Prussia was controlled by Göring.|$|E
5|$|The {{execution}} of Victor Peirce in episode eight {{is portrayed as}} taking place in his car {{at the front of}} his home, but Peirce was shot dead while parked opposite a supermarket in Bay Street, Port Melbourne. The murder of alleged drug dealer Willie Thompson was portrayed in episode ten as Thompson being shot after leaving a martial arts class in broad daylight. However, Thompson was shot dead at around 9:30 pm, and the murder occurred on Waverley Road in the Melbourne suburb of Chadstone, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> to drive off in his car, directly outside the entrance to the martial arts centre. Another fiction portrayed was the murder of Nik Radev by both Victor Brincat and Andrew Veniamin in the late hours of the night when Radev was in fact ambushed on a residential street in Coburg in the company of two bodyguards in the late afternoon.|$|E
