Nike officially signed Vick again as <b>an</b> <b>athlete</b> on July 1, 2011.

30|$|There are {{a number}} of factors that {{increase}} <b>an</b> <b>athlete’s</b> risk of depression compared with the general population [5]. These factors include injury, termination and performance pressures. There is a significant relationship between <b>an</b> <b>athlete’s</b> depressive symptoms and performance [36], and as <b>an</b> <b>athlete’s</b> depressive experiences intensified, their performances were negatively affected by their symptoms [19], although sometimes other symptoms of mental disorders such as anxiety can occur before depression.|$|R

5|$|Near {{the top of}} the inrun, {{there is}} a 'start gate' – a metal or wooden beam – on which <b>an</b> <b>athlete</b> sits and awaits their signal to jump via a set of traffic lights (green, amber, and red). These lights are {{operated}} directly by Borek Sedlák. <b>An</b> <b>athlete</b> may enter the gate when amber is shown. If red is shown after this point, the wind conditions will have been deemed unfavourable for a safe jump: the athlete must then carefully exit the gate as they had entered it and await another opportunity to jump. Failure to dismount the gate within ten to fifteen seconds of being shown a red light, or jumping without having been given the signal to go, will disqualify the athlete.|$|E

5|$|The Olympic Charter {{requires}} that <b>an</b> <b>athlete</b> {{be a national}} {{of the country for}} which they compete. Dual nationals may compete for either country, as long as three years have passed since the competitor competed for the former country. However, if the NOCs and IF involved agree, then the IOC Executive Board may reduce or cancel this period. This waiting period exists only for athletes who previously competed for one nation and want to compete for another. If <b>an</b> <b>athlete</b> gains a new or second nationality, then they do not need to wait any designated amount of time before participating for the new or second nation. The IOC is only concerned with issues of citizenship and nationality after individual nations have granted citizenship to athletes.|$|E

5|$|To have {{a chance}} of winning a competition, two {{consistently}} good jumps must be made. If <b>an</b> <b>athlete</b> finds themselves in an uncompetitive position after the first round, their challenge in the second round is to make up ground via the attrition of other athletes, their own distance and style points, and wind/gate compensation. For <b>an</b> <b>athlete</b> who had a poor jump in round one, it is possible for them to climb up the order in round two with an excellent jump, and if other competitors fall by the wayside. Conversely, a high-scoring athlete may lose their advantage from round one if their second jump is not up to par.|$|E
