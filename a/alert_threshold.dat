The aim of this review was to systematically review the literature on <b>alert</b> <b>thresholds</b> for common chemistry and hematology tests in adults and to provide an explicit and ranked source of this evidence. Methods: The literature search covered the period of 1995 - 2014. Evidence sources were critically appraised and ranked using the 1999 Stockholm hierarchy for analytical performance specifications in laboratory medicine modified for establishing decision limits. Results: The 30 most frequently reported laboratory tests with <b>alert</b> <b>thresholds</b> are presented with evidence rankings. Similar thresholds were reported in North America, Europe and Asia. Seventy percent of papers reported thresholds set by individual institutions, while 18 % contained thresholds from surveys of laboratories or clinicians. Forty-six percent of the papers referred to 1 or both of the 2 American laboratory surveys from the early 1990 s. "Starter sets" of <b>alert</b> <b>thresholds</b> were recommended by 6 professional bodies, 3 of which were collaborations between pathologists and clinicians.

Ozone concentration levels above the <b>alert</b> <b>threshold</b> (smog alert) were measured in 2003 and 2006, with concentration levels above the <b>alert</b> <b>threshold</b> occurring mostly during heat episodes. Measurements for nitrogen dioxide showed a yearly average concentration at city street locations above the European limit value at approximately half the measuring sites between 2003 and 2006. Yearly average concentrations measured at regional locations have changed relatively little {{in the past four}} years, remaining below the limit value for this entire period. Particulate matter concentrations have been relatively constant in the past few three years, after peaking in 2003. There is an EU standard for particulate matter for short- and long-term exposure of the population, which is represented by year and day average concentrations, with a maximum number of exceedances per year allowed. The year averages for the 2003 to 2006 period are less than the standard for long-term exposure. The maximum number of days showing average concentrations above the limit value was violated at several locations in 2006.

Several of these RT systems provide preset alerts that sound when absolute glucose thresholds are reached. Additionally, some systems allow for predictive algorithm-based alerts that incorporate rates of change. However, clinical trials have identified significant noncompliance in the use of these devices, most notably in the pediatric and adolescent populations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Epidemics of {{meningococcal}} {{disease in}} Africa are commonly detected {{too late to}} prevent many cases. We assessed weekly meningitis incidence {{as a tool to}} detect epidemics in time to implement mass vaccination. METHODS: Meningitis incidence for 41 subdistricts in Mali was determined from cases recorded in health centres (1989 - 98) and from surveillance data (1996 - 98). For incidence thresholds of 5 to 20 cases per 100000 inhabitants per week, we calculated sensitivity and specificity for detecting epidemics, and determined the time lapse between threshold and epidemic peak. FINDINGS: We recorded 9084 meningitis cases. Clinic-based weekly incidence of 5 and 10 cases per 100000 inhabitants detected all meningitis epidemics (sensitivity 100 %, 95 % CI 93 - 100), with median threshold-to-peak time of 5 and 3 weeks. Under-reporting reduced sensitivity: only surveillance thresholds of 5 or 7 cases per 100000 inhabitants per week detected all epidemics. Crossing the lower threshold before the 10 th calendar week doubled epidemic risk relative to crossing it later (relative risk 2. 1, 95 % CI 1. 4 - 3. 2). At 10 cases per 100000 inhabitants per week, specificity for outbreak prediction was 88 %, 95 % CI 83 - 91). For populations under 30000, 3 to 5 cases in one or two weeks predicted epidemics with 85 % to 97 % specificity. INTERPRETATION: Low meningitis thresholds improve timely detection of epidemics. Ten cases per 100000 inhabitants per week in one area confirm epidemic activity in a region, with few false alarms. An <b>alert</b> <b>threshold</b> of 5 cases per 100000 inhabitants per week allows time to investigate, prepare for an epidemic, and initiate mass vaccination where appropriate.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{epidemiological}} {{and laboratory}} studies have evidenced {{the fact that}} atmospheric particulate matter (PM) {{increases the risk of}} respiratory morbidity. It is well known that the smallest fraction of PM (PM 1 - particulate matter having a diameter below 1 mum) penetrates the deepest into the airways. The ratio of the different size fractions in PM is highly variable, but in industrial areas PM 1 can be significant. Despite these facts, the health effects of PM 1 have been poorly investigated and air quality standards are based on PM 10 and PM 2. 5 (PM having diameters below 10 mum and 2. 5 mum, respectively) concentrations. Therefore, this study aimed at determining whether exposure to ambient PM 1 at a near <b>alert</b> <b>threshold</b> level for PM 10 has respiratory consequences in rats. METHODS: Rats were either exposed for 6 weeks to 100 mug/m(3) (<b>alert</b> <b>threshold</b> level for PM 10 in Hungary) urban submicron aerosol, or were kept in room air. End-expiratory lung volume, airway resistance (Raw) and respiratory tissue mechanics were measured. Respiratory mechanics were measured under baseline conditions and following intravenous methacholine challenges to characterize the development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AH). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was analyzed and lung histology was performed. RESULTS: No significant differences were detected in lung volume and mechanical parameters at baseline. However, the exposed rats exhibited significantly greater MCh-induced responses in Raw, demonstrating the progression of AH. The associated bronchial inflammation was evidenced by the accumulation of inflammatory cells in BALF and by lung histology. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that exposure to concentrated ambient PM 1 (mass concentration at the threshold level for PM 10) leads to the development of mild respiratory symptoms in healthy adult rats, which may suggest a need for the reconsideration of threshold limits for airborne PM 1...|$|E

Four types of <b>alert</b> <b>threshold</b> algorithms are compared: weekly percentile, weekly mean with standard deviation (simple, moving average, and logtransformed case numbers), slide positivity proportion, and slope of weekly cases on log scale.

Simple weekly percentile cutoffs appear {{to be as good as}} more complex algorithms for detecting malaria epidemics in Ethiopia. The comparative method developed here may be useful for testing other proposed alert thresholds and for application in other populations. Accurate, well-validated systems to predict unusual increases in malaria cases are needed to enable timely action by public health officials to control such epidemics and mitigate their impact on human health. Such systems are particularly needed in epidemic-prone regions, such as the East African highlands. In such places, transmission is typically highly seasonal, with considerable variation from year to year, and immunity in the population is often incomplete. Consequently, epidemics, when they occur, often cause high illness and death rates, even in adults (1, 2). The value of timely interventions—such as larviciding, residual house spraying, and mass drug administration—to control malaria epidemics has been documented (3), but much less evidence exists about how to identify appropriate times to take such action when resources are limited (4). Ideally, public health and vector control workers would have access to a system that provides alerts when substantial numbers of excess cases are expected, and such alerts should be sensitive (so that alerts are reliably generated when excess cases are imminent), specific (so that there are few false alarms or alerts that d...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} feasibility of using real-time, high-fidelity, intracardiac electrogram monitoring from a permanently implantable ischemia detection system (IIDS), with long-range telemetry capability to detect ST-segment shifts associated with acute or subacute coronary occlusion in a porcine model. BackgroundEarly identification of coronary occlusion with ST-segment elevation could profoundly accelerate the timing of revascularization and improve clinical outcomes. MethodsThis paper reports the first investigation using real-time, high-fidelity, intracardiac electrogram monitoring from a permanently IIDS, with long-range telemetry capability. This IIDS was tested in an ambulatory porcine model, with acute coronary occlusion precipitated by stent thrombosis. Two overlapping copper stents were implanted in the left anterior descending (n = 3), the circumflex (n = 3), or the right coronary artery (n = 2) of juvenile farm pigs. Monitoring was carried using telemetry from the IIDS. ResultsAll stented pigs had acute ST-segment elevation event(s) triggering the <b>alerting</b> <b>thresholds</b> of the IIDS. All triggered events were confirmed to be caused by thrombosis of the copper stent(s), and well correlated to infarct age and location. Four of the 8 pigs died from ventricular fibrillation, recorded by the IIDS at a mean time of 70 ± 121 h after ST-segment alert. The sensitivity and specificity of alerting for ST-segment shift, associated with thrombotic coronary occlusion, were 100 % and 100 %, respectively. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the ability of an implantable ischemia detection system to detect ST-segment elevation from coronary occlusion in a porcine model of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. ST-segment elevation was sufficient to trigger <b>alerting</b> <b>thresholds</b> in all 3 epicardial coronary distributions. Such a system, with real-time alerting capability, could advance the time frame of reperfusion therapy and potentially prevent, rather than interrupt, acute myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease...|$|R
40|$|A key {{challenge}} to the routine, safe operation of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) {{is the development of}} detect-and-avoid (DAA) systems to aid the UAS pilot in remaining "well clear" of nearby aircraft. The goal {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of alerting criteria and pilot response delay on the safety and performance of UAS DAA systems in the context of routine civil UAS operations in the National Airspace System (NAS). A NAS-wide fast-time simulation study was conducted to assess UAS DAA system performance with a large number of encounters and a broad set of DAA alerting and guidance system parameters. Three attributes of the DAA system were controlled as independent variables in the study to conduct trade-off analyses: UAS trajectory prediction method (dead-reckoning vs. intent-based), <b>alerting</b> time <b>threshold</b> (related to predicted time to LoWC), and <b>alerting</b> distance <b>threshold</b> (related to predicted Horizontal Miss Distance, or HMD). A set of metrics, such as the percentage of true positive, false positive, and missed alerts, based on signal detection theory and analysis methods utilizing the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were proposed to evaluate the safety and performance of DAA alerting and guidance systems and aid development of DAA system performance standards. The effect of pilot response delay on the performance of DAA systems was evaluated using a DAA alerting and guidance model and a pilot model developed to support this study. A total of 18 fast-time simulations were conducted with nine different DAA <b>alerting</b> <b>threshold</b> settings and two different trajectory prediction methods, using recorded radar traffic from current Visual Flight Rules (VFR) operations, and supplemented with DAA-equipped UAS traffic based on mission profiles modeling future UAS operations. Results indicate DAA <b>alerting</b> distance <b>threshold</b> has a greater effect on DAA system performance than DAA <b>alerting</b> time <b>threshold</b> or ownship trajectory prediction method. Further analysis on the alert lead time (time in advance of predicted loss of well clear at which a DAA alert is first issued) indicated a strong positive correlation between alert lead time and DAA system performance (i. e. the ability of the UAS pilot to maneuver the unmanned aircraft to remain well clear). While bigger distance thresholds had beneficial effects on alert lead time and missed alert rate, it also generated a higher rate of false alerts. In the design and development of DAA alerting and guidance systems, therefore, the positive and negative effects of false alerts and missed alerts should be carefully considered to achieve acceptable alerting system performance by balancing false and missed alerts. The results and methodology presented in this study are expected to help stakeholders, policymakers and standards committees define the appropriate setting of DAA system parameter thresholds for UAS that ensure safety while minimizing operational impacts to the NAS and equipage requirements for its users before DAA operational performance standards can be finalized...|$|R
