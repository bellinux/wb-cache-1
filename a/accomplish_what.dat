Exceedingly small changes in axial length of the eyeball (18.6–19.2 micrometres) are caused by the action of the ciliary muscle during accommodation. However, these changes are far too small to account for the necessary changes in focus, producing changes of only −0.036 dioptres.|$|E
5|$|Until the film's production, many {{special effects}} in the film {{industry}} were achieved using miniature models, matte paintings, and on-set visual effectsalthough other films had made extensive use of CGI. Knoll previewed 3,500 storyboards for the film; Lucas accompanied him to explain factors of the shots that would be practical and those which would be created through visual effects. Knoll later said that on hearing the explanations of the storyboards, {{he did not know}} how to <b>accomplish</b> <b>what</b> he had seen. The result was a mixture of original techniques and the newest digital techniques to make it difficult for the viewer to guess which technique was being used. Knoll and his visual effects team wrote new computer software, including cloth simulators to allow a realistic depiction of the digital characters' clothing, to create certain shots. Another goal was to create computer-generated characters that could act seamlessly with live-action actors. While filming scenes with CGI characters, Lucas would block the characters using their corresponding voice actors on-set. The voice actors were then removed and the live-action actors would perform the same scene alone. A CGI character would later be added into the shot to complete the conversation. Lucas also used CGI to correct the physical presence of actors in certain scenes. Practical models were used when their visuals helped with miniature sceneries for backgrounds, set extensions, and model vehicles that would be scanned to create the digital models or filmed to represent spaceships and podraces.|$|E

Boy Scout, Cliff Elliot, stirs the pot as he tries to cling to the last shreds of patriotism and earn his Eagle Scout Award.

25|$|As {{human beings}} (Dasein) {{navigate}} their world around them, {{they look for}} tools and ways to <b>accomplish</b> <b>what</b> they need to do: food and water for survival, instruments to complete tasks, shelter for protection etc. Heidegger theorized that Dasein’s “quest” to exist, so to speak, can only be completed via his relationship with others and his world around him. This is what Slife termed radical relationality: human beings are fundamentally and inescapably relational beings. That human beings exist in-the-world as radically relational beings ultimately means that Dasein must seek out his existence through opportunities that present themselves in his world and through his relationships with others. In other words, what ontological hermeneutics is saying about what nature is that human beings cannot {{be thought of as}} merely “self-certain actants” capable of distancing themselves above and against their world effortly to determine rational courses of action, nor as little more than computers that have been programmed to react to stimuli. Instead, all understanding of how to exist comes from being-in-the-world and understanding one’s relation to, or place in, that world. Put another way, human beings conduct themselves within the context of their life-world (the world in which their lives take place) which provides Dasein with possibilities of how to act. It is this understanding of himself in that life-world that informs his choice.|$|E

500|$|This {{movie was}} also the subject of comment from feminist critics. Mimi Nguyen says the film [...] "pokes fun at the {{ultimately}} repressive gender roles that seek to make Mulan a domesticated creature". Nadya Labi agreed, saying [...] "there is a lyric in the film that gives the lie to the bravado of the entire girl-power movement." [...] She pointed out that Mulan needed to become a boy in order to <b>accomplish</b> <b>what</b> she did. Kathleen Karlyn, {{an assistant professor of}} English at the University of Oregon, also criticized the film's portrayal of gender roles: [...] "In order to even imagine female heroism, we're placing it in the realm of fantasy". Pam Coats, the producer of Mulan, said that the film aims to present a character who exhibits both masculine and feminine influences, being both physically and mentally strong.|$|E
500|$|Timothy Johnson {{contends that}} Nixon in China goes beyond minimalism in {{important}} ways. [...] Adams had been inspired, in developing his art, by minimalist composers such as Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley, {{and this is}} reflected in the work by repetitive rhythmic patterns. [...] However, the opera's complex harmonic structures are very different from the simpler ones in, for example, Glass's Einstein on the Beach, which Adams terms [...] "mindlessly repetitive"; Johnson nevertheless considers the Glass opera an influence on Nixon in China. As Glass's techniques did not allow Adams to <b>accomplish</b> <b>what</b> he wanted, he employed a system of constantly shifting metric organizational schemes to supplement the repeated rhythms in the opera. [...] The music is marked by metrical dissonance, which occurs both for musical reasons and in response to the text of the opera.|$|E

The magazine also {{compared the}} feeling of prioritization as a swarm of enemies appear to the feeling of clutter when stacking Tetris blocks haphazardly. Edge also called the red screen and sound effect that flashes upon the player's death [...] "brash and lo-fi and unexpectedly poignant", for which they noted Rogers's interest in noise rock and credited the effect as [...] "a beguiling personal signature". Alternatively, Paste Joe Bernardi thought the sound did not <b>accomplish</b> <b>what</b> it intended. Joseph Leray of TouchArcade noticed how the guitar sound in Gears of War was reaffirming but the opposite in Ziggurat. Edge noted that nuances such as gravity's influence on the arc of uncharged shots make Ziggurat more of a basketball or golf-like sport skill than a [...] "2D Halo".

500|$|Throughout the campaign, Lee was {{influenced}} by the belief that his men were invincible; most of Lee's experiences with the Army of Northern Virginia had convinced him of this, including the great victory at Chancellorsville in early May and the rout of the Union troops at Gettysburg on July 1. Since morale {{plays an important role in}} military victory when other factors are equal, Lee did not want to dampen his army's desire to fight and resisted suggestions, principally by Longstreet, to withdraw from the recently captured Gettysburg to select a ground more favorable to his army. War correspondent Peter W. Alexander wrote that Lee [...] "acted, probably, under the impression that his troops were able to carry any position however formidable. If such was the case, he committed an error, such however as the ablest commanders will sometimes fall into." [...] Lee himself concurred with this judgment, writing to President Davis, [...] "No blame can be attached to the army for its failure to <b>accomplish</b> <b>what</b> was projected by me, nor should it be censured for the unreasonable expectations of the public—I am alone to blame, in perhaps expecting too much of its prowess and valor." ...|$|E

500|$|The Gentlemen, {{called the}} [...] "creepiest villains we've ever done" [...] by series writer Doug Petrie, were {{inspired}} by a nightmare Whedon had as a child, specifically {{one in which he}} was in bed and approached by a floating monster. Whedon fashioned The Gentlemen as something from a Brothers Grimm fairy tale, intending them to be frightening to children — monsters who carve out people's hearts, smiling as they do so. Nosferatu, Pinhead from Hellraiser, and Mr. Burns from The Simpsons all served as physical models for The Gentlemen. Elegantly Victorian in costume and demeanor, Whedon found their politeness and grace especially unsettling. Their metallic teeth {{were inspired by}} the intersection of Victorian culture with the height of the Industrial age, an era that Whedon considers [...] "classically creepy". For Buffy studies scholar Rhonda Wilcox, The Gentlemen and their straitjacket-wearing minions, who clumsily flap, gyrate, and crouch as they move, are representative of class disparity and patriarchy: The Gentlemen, with their Victorian suits, move effortlessly to <b>accomplish</b> <b>what</b> they set out to do while their minions, whom Whedon called [...] "footmen", do the [...] "dirty work".|$|E
500|$|When the {{campaign}} season opened in May 1777, General Washington moved {{most of his}} army from its winter quarters in Morristown, New Jersey to a strongly fortified position in the Watchung Mountains. In June 1777, Howe {{began a series of}} odd moves in New Jersey, apparently in an attempt to draw Washington and his army out of that position onto terrain more favourable for a general engagement. His motives for this are uncertain; historian John Buchanan argues that Howe was determined to attempt to draw Washington into a major engagement while both were in northern New Jersey, writing that [...] "Washington's shift in position had whetted Howe's appetite for a major action when, if everything went right, he would finally <b>accomplish</b> <b>what</b> he and his brother's policies had denied him the previous year: the destruction of the Continental Army", but that Howe's underlying campaign goal for the season was Philadelphia. [...] One British major wrote that [...] "he report circulated by those in power is that it was thought necessary to march to Hilsborough to offer Washington battle." [...] Americans like Henry Knox were perplexed but also concluded that was its purpose: [...] "It was unaccountable that [...] should stop short when they had gone only nine miles ... In {{the course of a day}} or two [...] discovered that they ... had come out with an intention of drawing us into the plain." [...] Washington had intelligence that Howe had moved without taking the heavy river-crossing equipment, and was apparently not fooled at all.|$|E
