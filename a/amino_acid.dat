5|$|Most {{mutations}} within {{genes are}} neutral, having {{no effect on}} the organism's phenotype (silent mutations). Some mutations do not change the <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> sequence because multiple codons encode the same <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> (synonymous mutations). Other mutations can be neutral if they lead to <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> sequence changes, but the protein still functions similarly with the new <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> (e.g. conservative mutations). Many mutations, however, are deleterious or even lethal, and are removed from populations by natural selection. Genetic disorders are the result of deleterious mutations and can be due to spontaneous mutation in the affected individual, or can be inherited. Finally, a small fraction of mutations are beneficial, improving the organism's fitness and are extremely important for evolution, since their directional selection leads to adaptive evolution.|$|E

Non-essential <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> are made by the body from essential <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> or in the normal breakdown of proteins.

5|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of a gene's DNA specifies the <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> sequence of a protein through the genetic code. Sets of three nucleotides, known as codons, each correspond {{to a specific}} <b>amino</b> <b>acid.</b> The principle that three sequential bases of DNA code for each <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> was demonstrated in 1961 using frameshift mutations in the rIIB gene of bacteriophage T4 (see Crick, Brenner et al. experiment).|$|E

5|$|A linear {{chain of}} <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> {{residues}} {{is called a}} polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues. The sequence of <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues in a protein {{is defined by the}} sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.|$|E

5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to {{synthesize}} the 20 common amino acids. Most bacteria and plants can synthesize all twenty, but mammals can only synthesize eleven nonessential amino acids, so nine essential amino acids must be obtained from food. Some simple parasites, such as the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, lack all <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis and take their amino acids directly from their hosts. All amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway. Nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine. <b>Amino</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis depends on the formation of the appropriate alpha-keto acid, which is then transaminated to form an <b>amino</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E

5|$|Amino acids are organic {{compounds}} containing amine (-NH2) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups, {{along with a}} side chain (R group) specific to each <b>amino</b> <b>acid.</b> The key elements of an <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N), although other elements {{are found in the}} side chains of certain amino acids. About 500 amino acids are known (though only 20 appear in the genetic code) and can be classified in many ways. They can be classified according to the core structural functional groups' locations as alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), gamma- (γ-) or delta- (δ-) amino acids; other categories relate to polarity, pH level, and side chain group type (aliphatic, acyclic, aromatic, containing hydroxyl or sulfur, etc.). In the form of proteins, <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues form the second-largest component (water is the largest) of human muscles and other tissues.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in {{determination of the}} high-resolution structure of membrane proteins now enable analysis of the main features of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> in transmembrane (TM) segments in comparison with <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> in water-soluble helices. In this work, we conducted a large-scale analysis of the prevalent locations of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> by using a data set of 170 structures of integral membrane proteins obtained from the MPtopo database and 930 structures of water-soluble helical proteins obtained from the protein data bank. Large hydrophobic <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> (Leu, Val, Ile, and Phe) plus Gly were clearly prevalent in TM helices whereas polar <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> (Glu, Lys, Asp, Arg, and Gln) were less frequent {{in this type of}} helix.

5|$|Amino acids {{must first}} pass out of organelles and cells into blood {{circulation}} via <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> transporters, since the amine and carboxylic acid groups are typically ionized.
