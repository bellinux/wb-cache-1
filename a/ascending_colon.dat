25|$|The <b>ascending</b> <b>colon</b> is {{sometimes}} {{attached to the}} appendix via Gerlach's valve. The appendix, traditionally seen as a vestigial organ, {{has been shown to}} have a high concentration of lymphatic cells. In ruminants, the <b>ascending</b> <b>colon</b> is known as the spiral colon.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ascending</b> <b>colon</b> is {{the first}} of four {{sections}} of the large intestine. It is connected to the small intestine by a section of bowel called the cecum. The <b>ascending</b> <b>colon</b> runs upwards through the abdominal cavity toward the transverse colon for approximately eight inches (20cm).|$|E
25|$|Left-sided diverticular disease (involving the sigmoid colon) is {{most common}} in the West, while right-sided diverticular disease (involving the <b>ascending</b> <b>colon)</b> {{is more common in}} Asia and Africa. Among {{patients}} with diverticulosis, 4 to 15% may go on to develop diverticulitis.|$|E

25|$|Ulcerative colitis {{is usually}} {{continuous}} from the rectum, with the rectum almost universally being involved. Perianal disease is rare. The degree of involvement endoscopically ranges from proctitis or {{inflammation of the}} rectum, to left sided colitis, to pancolitis, which is inflammation involving the <b>ascending</b> <b>colon.</b>|$|E
25|$|A human colon is {{considered}} abnormally enlarged {{if it has}} a diameter greater than 12cm in the cecum (it is usually less than 9cm), greater than 6.5cm in the rectosigmoid region and greater than 8cm for the <b>ascending</b> <b>colon.</b> The transverse colon is usually less than 6cm in diameter.|$|E
25|$|Retroperitoneal {{parts are}} covered with adventitia. They blend into the {{surrounding}} tissue and are fixed in position. For example, the retroperitoneal section of the duodenum usually passes through the transpyloric plane. These include the esophagus, pylorus of the stomach, distal duodenum, <b>ascending</b> <b>colon,</b> descending colon and anal canal. In addition, the oral cavity has adventitia.|$|E
50|$|These ganglia contain neurons whose postganglionic axons {{innervate}} the stomach, liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidney, small intestine, and the <b>ascending</b> and transverse <b>colon.</b> They directly innervate the ovarian theca {{and secondary}} interstitial cells and exert an indirect {{action on the}} luteal cells.|$|R
30|$|The {{anterior}} pararenal space (APS) is bounded anteriorly by {{the posterior}} parietal peritoneum, laterally by the lateroconal fascia and posteriorly by the anterior renal fascia; it contains the pancreatic gland, retroperitoneal {{segments of the}} duodenum, <b>ascending</b> and descending <b>colon</b> and the mesenteric root, as well as adipose tissue. This space is continuous across the midline [25].|$|R
5000|$|Disease being treated; (i.e., no {{colectomy}} surgery {{can cure}} Crohn's disease, because the disease usually recurs {{at the site}} where the healthy sections of the large intestine were joined together. For example, if a patient with Crohn's disease has a transverse colectomy, their Crohn's will usually reappear at the resection site of the <b>ascending</b> and descending <b>colons.)</b> ...|$|R
25|$|The epigastric {{region is}} the upper central square and {{contains}} {{the bottom edge}} of the liver {{as well as the}} upper areas of the stomach. The diaphragm curves like an upside down U over these three regions. The central right region is called the right lumbar region and contains the <b>ascending</b> <b>colon</b> and the right edge of the small intestines. The central square contains the transverse colon and the upper regions of the small intestines. The left lumbar region contains the left edge of the transverse colon and the left edge of the small intestine. The lower right square is the right iliac region and contains the right pelvic bones and the <b>ascending</b> <b>colon.</b> The lower left square is the left iliac region and contains the left pelvic bone and the lower left regions of the small intestine. The lower central square contains the bottom of the pubic bones, upper regions of the bladder and the lower region of the small intestine.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{functions}} of the colon is to remove the water and other key nutrients from waste material and recycle it. As the waste material exits the small intestine through the ileocecal valve, it will move into the cecum {{and then to the}} <b>ascending</b> <b>colon</b> where this process of extraction starts. The unwanted waste material is moved upwards toward the transverse colon by the action of peristalsis.|$|E
25|$|The {{parts of}} the colon are either {{intraperitoneal}} or behind it in the retroperitoneum. Retroperitoneal organs in general {{do not have a}} complete covering of peritoneum, so they are fixed in location. Intraperitoneal organs are completely surrounded by peritoneum and are therefore mobile. Of the colon, the <b>ascending</b> <b>colon,</b> descending colon and rectum are retroperitoneal, while the cecum, appendix, transverse colon and sigmoid colon are intraperitoneal. This is important as it affects which organs can be easily accessed during surgery, such as a laparotomy.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{practitioners}} push on {{the left}} lower quadrant {{to see where the}} patient complains of pain. If pain is felt in the right lower quadrant, then there may be an inflamed organ or piece of tissue in the right lower quadrant. The appendix is generally the prime suspect, although other pathology can also give a [...] "positive" [...] Rovsing's sign. If left lower quadrant pressure by the examiner leads only to left-sided pain or pain on both the left and right sides, then there may be some other pathologic etiology. This may include causes relating to the bladder, uterus, <b>ascending</b> (right) <b>colon,</b> fallopian tubes, ovaries, or other structures ...|$|R
50|$|In {{front of}} the fascia {{anterior}} to the perinephric space (also known as Toldt's membrane) is the anterior pararenal space which contains the pancreas, <b>ascending</b> and descending <b>colon,</b> and second through fourth parts of the duodenum. The fascia posterior to the perinephric space was named Zuckerkandl's fascia. Posterior to this lies the posterior paranephric space which does not contain any abdominal organs.|$|R
40|$|This topic {{begins with}} a {{diagrammatic}} overview of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with particular relevance to the structure and function of the large intestine. The topic then breaks down into the structure and function of the {{various parts of the}} large intestine, including the appendix, caecum, <b>colon</b> (<b>ascending,</b> descending, transverse and sigmoid), rectum and anal canal. The descriptions for each of the above parts are accompanied by diagrams and histological images. ...|$|R
25|$|Lymphatic {{drainage}} {{from the}} <b>ascending</b> <b>colon</b> and proximal {{two-thirds of the}} transverse colon is to the colic lymph nodes and the superior mesenteric lymph nodes, which drain into the cisterna chyli. The lymph from the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the upper rectum drain into the inferior mesenteric and colic lymph nodes. The lower rectum to the anal canal above the pectinate line drain to the internal iliac nodes. The anal canal below the pectinate line drains into the superficial inguinal nodes. The pectinate line only roughly marks this transition.|$|E
25|$|The abdomen may {{be divided}} into four quadrants, more {{commonly}} used in medicine, subdivides the cavity with one horizontal and one vertical line that intersect at the patient’s umbilicus (navel). The right upper quadrant (RUQ) includes the lower right ribs, {{right side of the}} liver, and right side of the transverse colon. The left upper quadrant (LUQ) includes the lower left ribs, stomach, spleen, and upper left area of the transverse colon. The right lower quadrant (RLQ) includes the right half of the small intestines, <b>ascending</b> <b>colon,</b> right pelvic bone and upper right area of the bladder. The left lower quadrant (LLQ) contains the left half of the small intestine and left pelvic bone.|$|E
25|$|The {{primitive}} gut {{is suspended}} from the posterior abdominal wall by the dorsal mesentery. The gastrointestinal tract and associated dorsal mesentery are subdivided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut regions based on the respective blood supply. The foregut is supplied by the celiac trunk, the midgut is supplied by the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and the hindgut is supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). This division is established by the fourth week of development. After this, the midgut undergoes a period of rapid elongation, forcing it to herniate through the navel. During herniation, the midgut rotates 90° anti-clockwise around the axis of the SMA and forms the midgut loop. The cranial portion of the loop moves {{to the right and}} the caudal portion of the loop moves toward the left. This rotation occurs at about the eighth week of development. The cranial portion of the loop will develop into the jejunum, while most of the ileum and the caudal part of the loop eventually form the terminal portion of the ileum, the <b>ascending</b> <b>colon</b> and the initial two-thirds of the transverse colon. As the foetus grows larger, the mid-gut loop is drawn back through the umbilicus and undergoes a further 180° rotation, completing a total of 270° rotation. At this point, about 10 weeks, the caecum lies close to the liver. From here it moves in a cranial to caudal direction to eventually lie in the lower right portion of the abdominal cavity. This process brings the <b>ascending</b> <b>colon</b> to lie vertically in the lateral right portion of the abdominal cavity apposed to the posterior abdominal wall. The descending colon occupies a similar position on the left side.|$|E
50|$|The {{portion of}} the retroperitoneum that is {{posterior}} wall of the abdomen and superior to the iliac vessels is of importance in gynecological oncology. This is the region where para-aortic and paracaval lymphadenectomies are done. The lateral boundary of the retroperitoneum {{is defined by the}} <b>ascending</b> and descending <b>colon.</b> The retroperitoneum can be approached from above by moving the duodenum aside as far as the major renal blood vessels.|$|R
30|$|Sections of the GI tract, such as stomach, {{first part}} of {{duodenum}} (5 cm), jejunum, ileum, caecum, appendix, transverse colon, sigmoid colon and upper third rectum are found within the peritoneal cavity, and are usually mobile[1, 2]. The second and third parts of the duodenum, <b>ascending</b> and descending <b>colon</b> and middle third of rectum are retroperitoneal and fixed; therefore, they may present with gas within the retroperitoneal compartment, usually the anterior pararenal space[3, 4].|$|R
30|$|The pararenal spaces lie {{superficial}} to the perinephric space. The anterior pararenal space {{lies between}} the parietal peritoneum and Gerota’s fascia, and contains the pancreas, duodenum, and <b>ascending</b> and descending <b>colon.</b> The posterior pararenal space sits between Zuckerkandl’s fascia and the transversalis fascia, and contains no organs, only fat pads. As the inter-fascial plane continues towards the iliac fascia, the space produced between Gerota’s fascia and Zuckerkandl’s fascia {{is known as}} the infrarenal space [1, 3].|$|R
25|$|The {{first step}} is usually a digital rectal examination, to examine {{the tone of the}} {{sphincter}} and to determine if preparation has been adequate. The endoscope is then passed through the anus up the rectum, the colon (sigmoid, descending, transverse and <b>ascending</b> <b>colon,</b> the cecum), and ultimately the terminal ileum. The endoscope has a movable tip and multiple channels for instrumentation, air, suction and light. The bowel is occasionally insufflated with air to maximize visibility (a procedure which gives one the false sensation of needing to take a bowel movement). Biopsies are frequently taken for histology. Additionally in a procedure known as chromoendoscopy, a contrast-dye (such as Indigo carmine) may be sprayed via the endoscope onto the bowel wall to help visualise any abnormalities in the mucosal morphology. A Cochrane review updated in 2016 found strong evidence that chromoscopy enhances the detection of cancerous tumours in the colon and rectum.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the chyme has reached this tube, most {{nutrients}} and 90% of the water have been absorbed by the body. At this point some electrolytes like sodium, magnesium, and chloride are left as well as indigestible parts of ingested food (e.g., {{a large part of}} ingested amylose, starch which has been shielded from digestion heretofore, and dietary fiber, which is largely indigestible carbohydrate in either soluble or insoluble form). As the chyme moves through the large intestine, most of the remaining water is removed, while the chyme is mixed with mucus and bacteria (known as gut flora), and becomes feces. The <b>ascending</b> <b>colon</b> receives fecal material as a liquid. The muscles of the colon then move the watery waste material forward and slowly absorb all the excess water, causing the stools to gradually solidify as they move along into the descending colon.|$|E
25|$|Rectal {{examinations}} are {{a cornerstone}} of colic diagnosis, as many large intestinal conditions can be definitively diagnosed by this method alone. Due {{to the risk of}} harm to the horse, a rectal examination is performed by a veterinarian. Approximately 40% of the gastrointestinal tract can be examined by rectal palpation, although this can vary based {{on the size of the}} horse and the length of the examiner's arm. Structures that can be identified include the aorta, caudal pole of the left kidney, nephrosplenic ligament, caudal border of the spleen, <b>ascending</b> <b>colon</b> (left dorsal and ventral, pelvic flexure), the small intestine if distended (it is not normally palpable on rectal), the mesenteric root, the base of the cecum and the medial cecal band, and rarely the inguinal rings. The location within the colon is identified based on size, presence of sacculations, number of bands, and if fecal balls are present.|$|E
2500|$|In humans, {{the large}} {{intestine}} {{begins in the}} right iliac region of the pelvis, just at or below the waist, where it is joined {{to the end of}} the small intestine at the cecum, via the ileocecal valve. It then continues as the <b>colon</b> <b>ascending</b> the abdomen, across the width of the abdominal cavity as the transverse colon, and then descending to the rectum and its endpoint at the [...] anal canal. Overall, in humans, the large intestine is about [...] long, which is about one-fifth of the whole length of the gastrointestinal tract.|$|R
40|$|A 33 {{year old}} man was {{admitted}} to hospital six days after the onset of abdominal pain. There was hypereosinophilia, but the cause could not be identified (primary hypereosinophilia). The hypereosinophilia, high C reactive protein concentration, and gastrointestinal symptoms were alleviated by corticosteroid treatment. Unexpectedly, after this apparent recovery, he was found dead on the 27 th day after admission. Necropsy disclosed two solid tumours primarily composed of eosinophils in the <b>ascending</b> and transverse <b>colon.</b> The cause of the sudden death was pulmonary artery emboli, derived from a thrombus in the left iliac vein...|$|R
50|$|In humans, {{the large}} {{intestine}} {{begins in the}} right iliac region of the pelvis, just at or below the waist, where it is joined {{to the end of}} the small intestine at the cecum, via the ileocecal valve. It then continues as the <b>colon</b> <b>ascending</b> the abdomen, across the width of the abdominal cavity as the transverse colon, and then descending to the rectum and its endpoint at the anal canal. Overall, in humans, the large intestine is about 1.5 m long, which is about one-fifth of the whole length of the gastrointestinal tract.|$|R
25|$|In {{some cases}} FAP can {{manifest}} {{higher in the}} colon than usual (for example, the <b>ascending</b> <b>colon,</b> or proximal to the splenic flexure, or in the gastric or duodenal tracts) where they show no symptoms until cancer is present and greatly advanced. APC mutations {{have been linked to}} certain other cancers such as thyroid cancer. As the mutation causing FAP is genetic, it can be inherited hereditarily from either parent, and passed to children. A genetic blood test of the APC gene exists that can determine whether it is deficient, and therefore can predict the possibility of FAP. Individuals at risk (due to family links or genetic testing) are usually offered routine monitoring of the intestinal tract every 1 – 5 years for life, from early adulthood, to detect the slow-forming polyps and act if found, before they can pose a threat. International polyposis registries exists that track known cases of FAP or APC gene defects, for research and clinical purposes. Mutation of APC also occurs commonly in incident cases of colorectal carcinoma, emphasizing its importance in this form of cancer.|$|E
2500|$|During these {{topographic}} changes, the dorsal mesentery undergoes corresponding changes. Most anatomical and embryological textbooks {{say that}} after adopting a final position, the ascending and descending mesocolons disappear during embryogenesis. Embryology—An Illustrated Colour Text says, [...] "most of the mid-gut retains the original dorsal mesentery, though parts of the duodenum derived from the mid-gut do not. The mesentery associated with the <b>ascending</b> <b>colon</b> and descending colon is resorbed, bringing these parts of the colon into close contact with the body wall." [...] In The Developing Human, the author states, [...] "the mesentery of the <b>ascending</b> <b>colon</b> fuses with the parietal peritoneum on this wall and disappears; consequently the <b>ascending</b> <b>colon</b> also becomes retroperitoneal". To reconcile these differences, several theories of embryologic mesenteric development—including the [...] "regression" [...] and [...] "sliding" [...] theories—have been proposed, but none has been widely accepted.|$|E
2500|$|In mammals, {{the colon}} {{consists}} of five sections: the cecum plus the <b>ascending</b> <b>colon,</b> the transverse colon, the descending colon, [...] the sigmoid colon and the rectum.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of ileal atresia with {{meconium}} peritonitis evaluated by fetal MRI. Prenatal ultrasounds in the third trimester initially demonstrated a cystic abdominal mass that resolved with development of dilated bowel loops. Fetal MRI at 32 weeks gestation identified a perihepatic collection with several dilated small bowel loops and normal sized meconium filled rectosigmoid consistent with distal bowel perforation and loculated meconium peritonitis. Following delivery, the infant presented with bowel obstruction. Contrast enema revealed a normal sized rectosigmoid with small <b>ascending</b> and transverse <b>colon.</b> A distal ileal atresia type IIIa was documented at surgery...|$|R
40|$|Distinct {{epidemiological}} and clinicopathological {{characteristics of}} colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) {{based on their}} anatomical location suggest different risk factors and pathways of transformation associated with proximal and distal colon carcinogenesis. These differences may reflect distinct biological characteristics of proximal and distal colonic mucosa, acquired in embryonic or postnatal development, that determine a differential response to uniformly distributed environmental factors. Alternatively, {{the differences in the}} epidemiology of proximal and distal CRCs could result from the presence of different procarcinogenic factors in the <b>ascending</b> versus descending <b>colon,</b> acting on cells with either similar or distinct biological characteristics.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} conduct a {{quantitative}} meta-analysis for the values of, and variability in, gastrointestinal (GI) pH in the different GI segments; characterize the effect of food on the values and variability in these parameters; and present quantitative meta-models of distributions of GI pH to help inform models of oral drug absorption. The literature was systemically reviewed for the values of, and the variability in, GI pH under fed and fasted conditions. The GI tract was categorized into the following 10 distinct regions: stomach (proximal, mid-distal), duodenum (proximal, mid-distal), jejunum and ileum (proximal, mid, and distal small intestine), and <b>colon</b> (<b>ascending,</b> transverse, and descending colon). Meta-analysis used the "metafor" package of the R language. The time course of postprandial stomach pH was modeled using NONMEM. Food significantly influenced the estimated meta-mean stomach and duodenal pH but had no significant influence on small intestinal and colonic pH. The time course of postprandial pH was described using an exponential model. Increased meal caloric content increased the extent and duration of postprandial gastric pH buffering. The {{different parts of the}} small intestine had significantly different pH. Colonic pH was significantly different for descending but not for <b>ascending</b> and transverse <b>colon.</b> Knowledge of GI pH is important for the formulation design of the pH-dependent dosage forms and in understanding the dissolution and absorption of orally administered drugs. The meta-models of GI pH may also be used as part of semi-physiological pharmacokinetic models to characterize the effect of GI pH on the in vivo drug release and pharmacokinetics. Ahmad Y.
