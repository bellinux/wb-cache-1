500|$|Stipe {{later called}} chorus lyrics of [...] "Sitting Still" [...] from R.E.M. debut album, Murmur, [...] "nonsense", {{saying in a}} 1994 online chat, [...] "You all know there aren't words, per se, {{to a lot of}} the early stuff. I can't even {{remember}} them." [...] In truth, Stipe carefully crafted the lyrics to many early R.E.M. songs. Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like [...] "simple pictures", but after a year he grew tired of the approach and [...] "started experimenting with lyrics that didn't make exact linear sense, and it's just gone from there." [...] In the mid-1980s, as Stipe's pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level. Mills explained, [...] "After you've made three records and you've written several songs and they've gotten better and better lyrically the next step would be to have somebody question you and say, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes [...] [...] [...]" [...] Songs like [...] "Cuyahoga" [...] and [...] "Fall on Me" [...] on Lifes Rich Pageant dealt with such concerns as pollution. Stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on Document and Green. [...] "Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were, and what we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror," [...] Stipe said later. [...] "In 1987 and '88 there was nothing to do but be active." [...] Stipe has since explored other lyrical topics. Automatic for the People dealt with [...] "mortality and dying. Pretty turgid stuff", according to Stipe, while Monster critiqued love and mass culture.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{president}} says that Senator Kerry is emboldening enemies {{and you say that}} we could get hit again if voters make the wrong choice in November, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> {{that it would be a}} dangerous thing to have John Kerry as president? ...|$|E
2500|$|My {{response}} {{is that when}} Creationists talk about God creating every individual species as a separate act, they always instance hummingbirds, or orchids, sunflowers and beautiful things. But I tend to think instead of a parasitic worm that is boring through {{the eye of a}} boy sitting on the bank of a river in West Africa, [...] that's going to make him blind. And , 'Are you telling me that the God you believe in, who you also say is an all-merciful God, who cares for each one of us individually, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> that God created this worm that can live in no other way than in an innocent child's eyeball? Because that doesn't seem to me to coincide with a God who's full of mercy'.|$|E
6000|$|She made a last {{effort to}} plead with him. [...] "Oh sir, is this {{behaving}} {{like the good}} kind man I thought <b>you</b> <b>were?</b> <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> Miss Emily's friend? Don't press me--for Miss Emily's sake!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Looking {{at him as}} if {{she wanted}} to pot at him with a rifle. I should like to do it myself. What <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> when he came up?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perrine, what <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> to Gabriel?" [...] {{asked the}} child opposite, seizing the first {{opportunity}} of breaking the desolate silence--doubly desolate at her age--which was preserved by all around her.|$|R
2500|$|The fifth Republican {{debate was}} held at Florida State Fair Grounds in Tampa, Florida, {{sponsored}} by CNN and Tea Party Express. It was moderated by Wolf Blitzer, and was notable for being the first Tea Party debate in history. Rick Perry was booed by the audience for defending his use of an executive order to mandate young girls have the HPV vaccine, which he defended by saying, [...] "I will always {{err on the side}} of life". The debate also engendered controversy when Blitzer asked Ron Paul a hypothetical question about a young man who could afford health insurance but refused to purchase any and went into a coma. When Blitzer asked Paul [...] "Congressman, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> that society should just let him die?", a few audience members shouted [...] "Yeah!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What the d---- <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> about Miss Lynch?" [...] said Barry, his {{attention}} somewhat {{arrested by the}} mention of his sister's name.|$|E
6000|$|The Capataz {{was heard}} {{striking}} {{the table with}} his fist. [...] "Everything? What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying,</b> there? Everything? Know everything? It is impossible! Everything?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jack; and he added, {{after looking}} at the two bodies with a long-drawn whistle of concern, [...] "and I wouldn't, if I <b>were</b> <b>you,</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} of this to Barker." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'By the bye,' said Aubrey, 'speaking {{of going}} away, what <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> while I <b>was</b> asleep? {{or was it}} a dream that I was looking through Tom's {{microscope}} at a rifle bullet in the Tyrol?' ...|$|R
6000|$|ELISABETTA. Sh--sh--Filippo! Can't {{you hear}} that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> behind his back what <b>you</b> see <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> afore his face? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Saturday allowance," [...] murmured Bayley. [...] "War's begun, but it wouldn't be {{etiquette}} {{for us to}} interfere. What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying,</b> my child?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No! No! Joel, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying?</b> I don't love Van. I don't care {{any more}} for him {{than for any}} other rider--or--or you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying?</b> The only {{agents were}} your uncle's hostility {{and his own}} obstinacy which would not study compromise. You must not blame {{yourself}} for anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|Harold blanched. [...] "Reggie, old man, {{you don't}} know what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> <b>You</b> can't {{remember}} Percy. I wish <b>you</b> wouldn't <b>say</b> these things, even in fun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, a few days," [...] she answered, {{following}} {{the girl with}} her eyes, and hardly hearing. [...] "What <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying?</b> In Dawson? A month, in fact, and glad to get away. The arctic male <b>is</b> elemental, <b>you</b> know, and somewhat strenuous in his feelings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, {{it is not}} {{the place}} for me, for I am a poor shot," [...] said Barret; [...] "besides, I have a fancy to stay here, where I <b>am.</b> <b>You</b> <b>say</b> it <b>is</b> a very good spot, Ivor, I understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What are you shaking at?" [...] {{he said in}} reproof. [...] "Was it no yoursel' that {{chose the}} spot? Lassie, say your prayers. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{answer to}} my command she ceased to groan; her face {{smoothed}} out, and with a bewildered smile she opened her eyes. [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying?</b> Have I been asleep?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For shame, Gonzaga," [...] she cried, now rising too. [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying?</b> Are {{you turned}} witless? Come, sirs, {{since you are}} both my friends, be friends each with the other." ...|$|E
2500|$|Why, what <b>is</b> this <b>you</b> <b>say?</b> A thing against {{reason and}} untrue! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's {{something}} for you to read in your spare moments, Mac. Glance through them {{any time you have}} a suspicion <b>you</b> may <b>be</b> a chump, and you'll have the comfort of knowing that there are others. What <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> about being married?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mad or sane," [...] said Geoffrey, [...] "say {{those words}} {{once more and}} I will stamp {{the life out of}} <b>you</b> where <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> <b>You</b> <b>say</b> that God promised her to you--promised that woman to a hound like <b>you.</b> Ah, <b>be</b> careful!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> to me, Theodore Colville?" [...] she exclaimed, {{flashing}} a full-eyed glance upon him, and then {{breaking into a}} laugh, as unnatural for her. [...] "Really, I don't believe you know!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> about me, Miss Amory?" [...] {{said the}} guardsman, with a grin. [...] "If it's {{anything}} good, {{say it in}} English, for I don't understand French when it's spoke so devilish quick." ...|$|E
6000|$|Here her {{attention}} was suddenly arrested by Madonna, who was eagerly and even impatiently signing on her fingers: [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> to Patty? Oh! do {{let me know}} what you are saying to Patty?" ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Whatever it <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> I <b>am,</b> I am not. Whatever it <b>is</b> <b>you</b> {{want from}} me, I will give. Whatever it <b>is</b> <b>you</b> take from me, you can take. What <b>is</b> it <b>you</b> {{can do to}} me? The worst thing <b>you</b> can do <b>is</b> kill me, after that I won't care, I am still free." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} what it cost;--but there it is." [...] This she said, drawing off her glove and showing him her finger. [...] "And when I am dead, there it will <b>be.</b> <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> want money, Frank. May I {{not give it}} you? Are not we brother and sister?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boyne, if {{you don't}} tell me right off {{just what you}} mean, I don't know what I will do to you! What are you driving at, for pity's sake? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> that she oughtn't to be engaged to Mr. Breckon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|In their utter stupefaction at the unexpectedness and seeming wildness of the statement, neither mother nor {{son could}} find a word to say. No more could Mr. Templeton for a moment. Then, suddenly, wrathfully: [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying,</b> sir?" [...] he roared.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dead! Margaret dead!" [...] the {{lieutenant}} repeated, incredulously. [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying,</b> doctor? There {{must be some}} mistake. She was well yesterday, for I was {{over there in the}} evening and did not leave until nine o'clock. It can't be true." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, father, that <b>is</b> {{just what}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>you</b> wanted, and I <b>am</b> sure <b>you</b> spent {{hours every day}} walking about with the children, or telling them stories." ...|$|R
6000|$|Though {{the words}} {{themselves}} were assuring, {{there was something}} in the tone of his voice which repressed her. [...] "To <b>you</b> I <b>am</b> true and faithful in all things; as faithful as though <b>you</b> <b>were</b> already my husband. What <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> of a time that is soon coming?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>is</b> that <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> Edie?" [...] said Oldbuck, hoping, perhaps, {{that his}} ears had betrayed their duty--"what <b>were</b> <b>you</b> {{speaking}} about!" ...|$|R
