5|$|<b>Acting</b> {{also plays}} a key role in Szabó’s films, as he values {{psychological}} complexity in his central characters.

5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as <b>acting</b> to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, <b>acting</b> on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, <b>acting</b> on zygote formation.|$|E

5|$|Dinklage had {{his first}} {{theatrical}} success in a fifth-grade production of The Velveteen Rabbit. Playing the lead, he was delighted by the audience's response to the show.

5|$|Following Whitman's {{resignation}} and DiFrancesco's departure, John O. Bennett served as <b>acting</b> governor {{for three and}} a half days. During that time, he signed a few bills into law, gave a State of the State Address, and held parties at Drumthwacket, the New Jersey governor's mansion. Similarly, Richard J. Codey served as <b>acting</b> governor as well. Because control of the New Jersey State Senate was split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett, each held the office of <b>acting</b> governor for three days. Perhaps this spectacle as much as any other factor led to the voters' decision to amend the state constitution to create the office of Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey.|$|E
