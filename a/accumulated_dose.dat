Chromosome analysis using fluorescence in situ hybrydization (FISH) and Giemsa techniques was undertaken on 63 workers and 45 administrative staff controls from the Bulgarian Nuclear Power Plant. Using the Giemsa method, the frequencies of cells studied with chromosome aberrations, dicentrics plus rings and chromosome fragments in the radiation workers were significantly higher com-pared with the control group (P = 0. 044, P = 0. 014, and P = 0. 033, respectively). A significant association between frequencies of dicentrics plus rings and <b>accumulated</b> <b>doses</b> was registered (P < 0. 01).

The change in magnetic properties only happens at specific energy levels and for certain microwave frequencies, there are specific magnetic strengths that cause these changes to occur (resonance).

50|$|All {{optical fibers}} undergo some darkening {{depending}} {{on a number}} of factors that include: ionization type, optical fiber core glass composition, operating wavelength, dose rate, total <b>accumulated</b> <b>dose,</b> temperature and power propagating through the core. Since attenuation is composition dependent, it is observed that fibers having pure silica cores and fluorine down doped claddings are amongst the most radiation hard fibers. The presence of dopants in the core such as germanium, phosphorus, boron, aluminum, erbium, ytterbium, thulium, holmium etc. compromises the radiation hardness of optical fibers. To minimize damage consequences, it is better to use a pure silica core fiber at higher operating wavelength, lower dose rate, lower total <b>accumulated</b> <b>dose,</b> higher temperature (accelerated recovery) and higher signal power (photo-bleaching). In addition to these intrinsic steps, external engineering may be required to shield the fiber from the effects of radiation.|$|E

40|$|Background Calculation of <b>accumulated</b> <b>dose</b> in {{fractionated}} radiotherapy {{based on}} spatial mapping of the dose points generally requires deformable image registration (DIR). The {{accuracy of the}} <b>accumulated</b> <b>dose</b> thus depends heavily on the DIR quality. This motivates investigations of how the registration uncertainty influences dose planning objectives and treatment outcome predictions. A framework was developed where the dose mapping {{can be associated with}} a variable known uncertainty to simulate the DIR uncertainties in a clinical workflow. The framework enabled us to study the dependence of dose planning metrics, and the predicted treatment outcome, on the DIR uncertainty. The additional planning margin needed to compensate for the dose mapping uncertainties can also be determined. We applied the simulation framework to a hypofractionated proton treatment of the prostate using two different scanning beam spot sizes to also study the dose mapping sensitivity to penumbra widths. Results The planning parameter most sensitive to the DIR uncertainty was found to be the targetD 95. We found that the registration mean absolute error needs to be ≤ 0. 20 cm to obtain an uncertainty better than 3 % of the calculated D 95  for intermediate sized penumbras. Use of larger margins in constructing PTV from CTV relaxed the registration uncertainty requirements to the cost of increased dose burdens to the surrounding organs at risk. Conclusions The DIR uncertainty requirements should be considered in an adaptive radiotherapy workflow since this uncertainty can have significant impact on the <b>accumulated</b> <b>dose.</b> The simulation framework enabled quantification of the accuracy requirement for DIR algorithms to provide satisfactory clinical accuracy in the <b>accumulated</b> <b>dose...</b>|$|E

This paper presents PCA models as a virtual tool to estimate dosimetric uncertainties for the bladder produced by motion and deformation between fractions. Our goal is to propose a methodology to determine the minimum number of modes required to quantify dose uncertainties of the bladder for motion/deformation models based on PCA. We trained individual PCA models using the bladder contours available from three patients with a planning computed tomography (CT) and on-treatment cone-beam CTs (CBCTs). Based on the above models and via deformable image registration (DIR), we estimated two accumulated doses: firstly, an <b>accumulated</b> <b>dose</b> obtained by integrating the planning dose over the Gaussian probability distribution of the PCA model; and secondly, an <b>accumulated</b> <b>dose</b> obtained by simulating treatment courses via a Monte Carlo approach.
