It was a more eccentric revival of the <b>Aldine</b> face than Bembo, it did not attract as much popularity.|$|E

The oldest surviving bookshop in Britain, Hatchards was started by John Hatchard at No.173 in 1797, moving to the current location at No.189-90 (now No.187) in 1801. <b>Aldine</b> Press moved to Piccadilly from Chancery Lane in 1842, and remained there until 1894.|$|E
5|$|Walter Law was {{a friend}} of Andrew Carnegie, who {{described}} Law as always having an interest in reading and writing. When he found a phrase to be clever or intriguing, Law would document it for further use. Carnegie wrote that Law often made new friends, and had an attractive personality. Law's personal interest was largely in his personal library of 7,000 volumes, which he collected for more than forty years. His library was said to contain many works of classic literature and history; on a vacation to Europe, Law mostly spent time in Greece visiting historic sites. He was {{also a member of the}} Alpine Club, <b>Aldine</b> Association, the American Fine Arts Society, Ardsley Casino (now Ardsley Country Club), the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, New York's Century Association, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Players, and Sleepy Hollow Country Club. Law and his wife were on the Aqueduct Guard Citizens' Committee, a committee tasked with providing for the needs of the New York Guard troops who were protecting the Old Croton Aqueduct during World War I. In 1892, Law also received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Yale University.|$|E

40|$|This report {{stems from}} a joint {{commemoration}} in 2015 of the fiftieth anniversary of the opening of Simon Fraser University and the five-hundredth anniversary {{of the death of}} pioneering Renaissance publisher and scholar Aldus Manutius. To mark these occasions, Publishing@SFU and SFU Library Special Collections joined forces to create a web-based resource comprising an outstanding selection of <b>Aldines</b> from the Wosk–McDonald collection, one of the largest such in North America. This report details the creation of Aldus@SFU, a prototype digital exhibition of the collection intended to be as widely accessible as possible on the Internet through ubiquitous technologies. Adopting a syncretic approach that emphasizes the continuous relationship between innovation and tradition, this report outlines and explores the key intersections between Aldus’ plan to popularize classical literature and the core mission of our project: to contribute to public knowledge by making SFU <b>Aldines</b> conveniently and freely available online via a flexible, mobile-optimized user interface. With original contributions from both scholars and popular media figures complementing the digitized volumes, Aldus@SFU is more than a mere companion website to a library collection. Instead, it is intended as a larger crossover digital platform: an inclusive, collaborative scholarly environment and a visually appealing educational resource whose audience includes not only scholars but also a wider interested public...|$|R
50|$|When {{he became}} bishop his health was overshadowed by asthma {{and he died}} at Eccleshall Castle, Staffordshire (the episcopal country residence), in December 1839 aged 65. Bishop Butler is buried in the church yard of the Collegiate Church of St Mary the Virgin Shrewsbury - the former parish church of Shrewsbury School. After his death the <b>Aldines</b> were sold by auction, the manuscripts {{purchased}} by the British Museum. In his will he left a mansion with land at Whitehall in Shrewsbury, which he had bought in 1834 as an intended retirement home, to his grandson Samuel.

50|$|The fame of the Elzevir editions rests chiefly on {{the works}} {{issued by the}} firm of Bonaventure and Abraham. Their Greek and Hebrew {{impressions}} are considered inferior {{to those of the}} <b>Aldines</b> and the Estiennes, but their small editions in 12mo, 16mo and 24mo, for elegance of design, neatness, clearness and regularity of type, and beauty of paper, cannot be surpassed. Special mention ought to be made of the two editions of the New Testament in Greek, published in 1624 and 1633, of which the latter is the more beautiful and the more sought after; the Psalterium Davidis, 1653; Virgilii opera, 1636; Terentii comediae, 1635; but the works that gave their press its chief celebrity are their collection of French authors on history and politics in 24mo, known under the name of the Petites Républiques, and their series of Latin, French and Italian classics in small 12mo. Also, they are noted for their publication in 1638 of Galileo's last work, the Two New Sciences, {{at a time when the}} Inquisition forbade the latter's writings.|$|R

25|$|Further {{settlement}} {{took place}} after Goodna was proclaimed {{a village in}} 1856. In the following year Joseph and Ellen (née Thompson) Broad built a store on the site, and sold the store later to Edwin Pitt, son of Charles and Mary Pitt. Edwin and his wife Cecilia (née Thompson sister of Ellen Broad) ran the store as a mixed business and Cecilia was the postmistress (see <b>Aldines).</b> They survived the 1893 Brisbane flood but a little later built Pitt's Hotel Cecil on the store site. It was later burnt down and the RSL is now on that site. Edwin and Cecilia's daughter Zora Brenda Pitt grew up and learnt to ride in Goodna and she became Royal National Show champion woman rider in the early 1900s, and the cemetery opened in 1859. By 1863 {{there was a small}} run to Holmes Inn, where Harriet Holmes was postmistress.The Congregational Church was also opened in 1863. It was built by Mr ES Thomas who was also the lay preacher. Mr Thomas was an Ipswich Councillor and the local JP. As a JP he also filled the role of acting magistrate on occasions. He built the now heritage listed house at 43 William Street and owned the adjacent general store and bakery. Mr Thomas originally operated a general store in Brisbane Road but this was flooded in 1893. They had to move their best things into {{the top floor of the}} nearby hotel. There was one acting police sergeant and a constable by 1868. W. Law established himself as a blacksmith in 1870, the year in which the Goodna State School opened.|$|R
6000|$|Curious and {{singular}} {{books are}} {{the next in}} our classification. The category is too large. The books that be [...] "curious" [...] (not in the booksellers' sense of [...] "prurient" [...] and [...] "disgusting,") are innumerable. All suppressed and condemned books, from [...] "Les Fleurs du Mal" [...] to Vanini's [...] "Amphitheatrum," [...] or the English translation of Bruno's [...] "Spaccia della Bestia Trionfante," [...] {{are more or less}} rare, and more or less curious. Wild books, like William Postel's [...] "Three Marvellous Triumphs of Women," [...] are [...] "curious." [...] Freakish books, like macaronic poetry, written in a medley of languages, are curious. Books from private presses are singular. The old English poets and satirists turned out many a book curious to the last degree, and priced at a fantastic value. Such are [...] "Jordan's Jewels of Ingenuity," [...] "Micro-cynicon, six Snarling Satyres" [...] (1599), and the [...] "Treatize made of a Galaunt," [...] printed by Wynkyn de Worde, and found pasted into the fly-leaf, on the oak-board binding of an imperfect volume of Pynson's [...] "Statutes." [...] All our early English poems and miscellanies are curious; and, as relics of delightful singers, are most charming possessions. Such are the [...] "Songes and Sonnettes of Surrey" [...] (1557), the [...] "Paradyce of daynty Deuices" [...] (1576), the [...] "Small Handful of Fragrant Flowers," [...] and [...] "The Handful of Dainty Delights, gathered out of the lovely Garden of Sacred Scripture, fit for any worshipful Gentlewoman to smell unto," [...] (1584). [...] "The Teares of Ireland" [...] (1642), are said, though one would not expect it, to be [...] "extremely rare," [...] and, therefore, precious. But there is no end to the list of such desirable rarities. If we add to them all books coveted as early editions, and, therefore, as relics of great writers, Bunyan, Shakespeare, Milton, Sterne, Walton, and the rest, we might easily fill a book with remarks on this topic alone. The collection of such editions is the most respectable, the most useful, and, alas, the most expensive of the amateur's pursuits. It is curious enough that the early editions of Swift, Scott, and Byron, are little sought for, if not wholly neglected; while early copies of Shelley, Tennyson, and Keats, have a great price set on their heads. The quartoes of Shakespeare, like first editions of Racine, are {{out of the reach of}} any but very opulent purchasers, or unusually lucky, fortunate book-hunters. Before leaving the topic of books which derive their value from the taste and fantasy of collectors, it must be remarked that, in this matter, the fashion of the world changes. Dr. Dibdin lamented, seventy years ago, the waning respect paid to certain editions of the classics. He would find that things have become worse now, and modern German editions, on execrable paper, have supplanted his old favourites. Fifty years ago, M. Brunet expressed his contempt for the designs of Boucher; now they are at the top of the fashion. The study of old booksellers' catalogues is full of instruction as to the changes of caprice. The collection of Dr. Rawlinson was sold in 1756. [...] "The Vision of Pierce Plowman" [...] (1561), and the [...] "Creede of Pierce Plowman" [...] (1553), brought between them no more than three shillings and sixpence. Eleven shillings were paid for the [...] "Boke of Chivalrie" [...] by Caxton. The [...] "Boke of St. Albans," [...] by Wynkyn de Worde, cost 1 pounds: 1s., and this was the highest sum paid for any one of two hundred rare pieces of early English literature. In 1764, a copy of the [...] "Hypnerotomachia" [...] was sold for two shillings, [...] "A Pettie Pallace of Pettie his Pleasures," [...] (ah, what a thought for the amateur!) went for three shillings, while [...] "Palmerin of England" [...] (1602), attained no more than the paltry sum of fourteen shillings. When Osborne sold the Harley collection, the scarcest old English books fetched but three or four shillings. If the wandering Jew had been a collector in the last century he might have turned a pretty profit by selling his old English books in this age of ours. In old French, too, Ahasuerus would have done a good stroke of business, for the prices brought by old Villons, Romances of the Rose, [...] "Les Marguerites de Marguerite," [...] and so forth, at the M'Carthy sale, were truly pitiable. A hundred years hence the original editions of Thackeray, or of Miss Greenaway's Christmas books, or [...] "Modern Painters," [...] may be the ruling passion, and <b>Aldines</b> and Elzevirs, black letter and French vignettes may all be despised. A book which is commonplace in our century is curious in the next, and disregarded in that which follows. Old books of a heretical character were treasures once, rare unholy possessions. Now we have seen so many heretics that the world is indifferent to the audacities of Bruno, and the veiled impieties of Vanini.|$|R
