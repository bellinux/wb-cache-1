Despite his mishandling of the Red Letter episode, I had not appreciated his defects until he took office a second time. I then realised his reluctance to take positive action and noted with dismay his increasing vanity and snobbery, while his habit of telling me, a junior Minister, the poor opinion he had of all his Cabinet colleagues made an unpleasant impression. I had not, however, expected that he would perpetrate the greatest betrayal in the political history of this country...

500|$|In {{contrast}} to other socialist states (which upheld the orthodox communist {{belief that the}} masses are masters of historical development), WPK ideology asserts that the masses can only initiate revolutionary change through a leader. While other socialist states often emphasized certain historical figures, due weight was still given to the people. The opposite occurred in North Korea, where the party line was [...] "The great revolutionary task {{of the working class}} is pioneered and led to victory by the Leader and completed under the leadership of the Leader only." [...] From this perspective, the revolutionary task given the working class by the other socialist regimes became the sole responsibility of the leader in North Korea. The leader theory supports one-man leadership, since all important tasks can only be accomplished by <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>leader</b> it argues. This ideological outlook may explain why Kim Il-sung appointed his son, Kim Jong-il, as his successor. In North Korea, Kim Il-sung was considered a [...] "Great Leader" [...] with a decisive role; he was cited by official media as the man who established the WPK and founder of the Juche idea.
