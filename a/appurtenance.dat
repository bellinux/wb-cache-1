25|$|The name Đirona {{consists}} of a long-vowel, o-grade stem tsīro- derived from the root *ster- and a -no- suffix forming adjectives of <b>appurtenance</b> in many Indo-European languages. Alternatively {{it may be an}} augmentative -on- suffix found in many Celtic divine names and epithets. To this is suffixed the Gaulish feminine singular -a, the usual feminine variant of o-stem adjectives and nouns. So *Tsīrona would seem to have meant ‘stellar’ or ‘astral’.|$|E
25|$|Henry by {{the grace}} of God King of England and France and Lord of Ireland sends {{greetings}} to his archbishops, bishops, abbotts, priors, dukes, marquises, earls, barons, judges, sheriffs, reeves, ministers and all our bailiffs and faithful subjects. Let it be known that we, motivated by our especial grace and certain knowledge of him, have granted for us and our heirs to our faithful servant William Denys, esquire of the Royal Body, to him, his heirs and assigns, the right to empark 500 acres of land, meadow, pasture and wood together with <b>appurtenance</b> at Le Worthy within the manor of Dereham in the county of Gloucestershire and enclose them with fences and hedges {{in order to make a}} park there. Also that they may have free warren in all their demesne lands within the said manor. No other person may enter this park or warren to hunt or catch anything which might belong to that park or warren without permission from William, his heirs or assigns under penalty of £10, provided that the land is not within our forest.|$|E

60|$|But Satan dogged the Tahitian's {{movements}} for a {{full hour}} before he {{made up his mind}} that the man was an <b>appurtenance</b> of the place.

60|$|This is {{the story}} of a man who did not {{appreciate}} his wife; also, of a woman who did him too great an honor when she gave herself to him. Incidentally, it concerns a Jesuit priest who had never been known to lie.

60|$|The {{house was}} a square cot of one story only, sloping up on all sides to a chimney in the midst. It had {{formerly}} been {{the home of a}} charcoal-burner, in times when that fuel was still used in the county houses. Its only <b>appurtenance</b> was a paled enclosure, there being no garden, the shade of the trees preventing the growth of vegetables.

60|$|The {{reconciliation}} made Ebbo retract his hasty {{resolution of}} relinquishing {{all the benefits}} resulting from his connection with the Sorel family, and his mother's fortune {{made it possible to}} carry out many changes that rendered the castle and its inmates far more prosperous in appearance than had ever been the case before.

60|$|Our little craft {{was soon}} in good order. From the spare rigging brought along, we made shrouds to the mast, and {{converted}} the boat- hook into a handy boom for the jib. Going large before the wind, we set this sail wing-and-wing with the main-sail. The latter, {{in accordance with}} the customary rig of whale-boats, was worked with a sprit and sheet. It could be furled or set in an instant. The bags of bread we stowed away in the covered space about the loggerhead, a useless <b>appurtenance</b> now, and therefore removed. At night, Jarl used it for a pillow; saying, that when the boat rolled it gave easy play to his head. The precious breaker we lashed firmly amidships; thereby much improving our sailing.|$|E
60|$|While Middlemas {{cherished}} these hopes, {{he approached}} the Residency. The sentinel on duty stopped him, as of course, {{but he was in}} possession of the counter-sign, and entered without opposition. He rounded the building in which the President of the Council resided, an able and active, but unconscientious man, who, neither in his own affairs, nor in those of the Company, was supposed to embarrass himself much about the means which he used to attain his object. A tap at a small postern gate was answered by a black slave, who admitted Middlemas to that necessary <b>appurtenance</b> of every government, a back stair, which, in its turn, conducted him {{to the office of the}} Bramin Paupiah, the Dubash, or steward of the great man, and by whose means chiefly he communicated with the native courts, and carried on many mysterious intrigues, which he did not communicate to his brethren at the council-board.|$|E
60|$|But {{when at last}} he gains his destination, you are {{amazed to}} {{perceive}} that {{all he has to}} say is imparted by a Freemason touch of his cap, and a bow. He then turns and makes off to his division, perhaps passing several brother Lieutenants, all bound on the same errand he himself has just achieved. For about five minutes these officers are coming and going, bringing in thrilling intelligence from all quarters of the frigate; most stoically received, however, by the First Lieutenant. With his legs apart, so as to give a broad foundation for the superstructure of his dignity, this gentleman stands stiff as a pike-staff on the quarter-deck. One hand holds his sabre--an <b>appurtenance</b> altogether unnecessary at the time; and which he accordingly tucks, point backward, under his arm, like an umbrella on a sun-shiny day. The other hand is continually bobbing up and down to the leather front of his cap, in response to the reports and salute of his subordinates, to whom he never deigns to vouchsafe a syllable, merely going through the motions of accepting their news, without bestowing thanks for their pains.|$|E
60|$|He then {{bowed to}} Miss Ogilvie, took his seat, handed in the <b>appurtenances,</b> received, showed, and {{pocketed}} the tickets, negotiated Janet's purchase of newspapers, and constituted himself altogether cavalier to the party.|$|R
60|$|And {{that very}} hour she caused to be {{replaced}} in the said room the desk and other <b>appurtenances</b> which had been taken out when the room had been arranged for the secretary.|$|R
60|$|To speak less abstractly. In England, for example, no mere {{parade of}} costly <b>appurtenances</b> {{would be so}} likely as with us, to create an {{impression}} of the beautiful in respect to the <b>appurtenances</b> themselves--or of taste as regards the proprietor:--this for the reason, first, that wealth is not, in England, the loftiest object of ambition as constituting a nobility; and secondly, that there, the true nobility of blood, confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste, rather avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a parvenu rivalry may at any time be successfully attempted.|$|R
60|$|Volumnia is away next day, and all {{the cousins}} are {{scattered}} before dinner. Not a cousin of the batch but is amazed to hear from Sir Leicester at breakfast-time of the obliteration of landmarks, and opening of floodgates, and cracking of the framework of society, manifested through Mrs. Rouncewell's son. Not a cousin of the batch but is really indignant, and connects it with the feebleness of William Buffy when in office, and really does feel deprived of {{a stake in the}} country--or the pension list--or something--by fraud and wrong. As to Volumnia, she is handed down the great staircase by Sir Leicester, as eloquent upon the theme as if there were a general rising in the north of England to obtain her rouge-pot and pearl necklace. And thus, with a clatter of maids and valets--for it is one <b>appurtenance</b> of their cousinship that however difficult they may find it to keep themselves, they MUST keep maids and valets--the cousins disperse to the four winds of heaven; and the one wintry wind that blows to-day shakes a shower from the trees near the deserted house, as if all the cousins had been changed into leaves.|$|E

6000|$|The {{greatest}} {{wonder of}} all was the way Mrs. Beale addressed her announcement, so far as could be judged, equally to Mrs. Wix, who, as if from sudden failure of strength, sank into a chair while Maisie surrendered to the visitor's embrace. As soon as the child was liberated she met with profundity Mrs. Wix's stupefaction and actually was able to see that while in a manner sustaining the encounter her face yet seemed with intensity to say: [...] "Now, for God's sake, don't crow 'I told you so!'" [...] Maisie was somehow on the spot aware of an absence of disposition to crow; it had taken her but an extra minute to arrive at such a quick survey of the objects surrounding Mrs. Beale as showed that among them was no <b>appurtenance</b> of Sir Claude's. She knew his dressing-bag now--oh with the fondest knowledge!--and there was an instant during which its not being there was a stroke of the worst news. She was yet to learn what it could be to recognise in some lapse of a sequence the proof of an extinction, and therefore remained unaware that this momentary pang was a foretaste of the experience of death. It of course yielded in a flash to Mrs. Beale's brightness, it gasped itself away in her own instant appeal. [...] "You've come alone?" ...|$|E
