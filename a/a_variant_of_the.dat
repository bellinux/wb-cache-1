5|$|The BAE Systems Hawk, is a British {{advanced}} jet trainer {{which first}} flew in 1974 as the Hawker Siddeley Hawk. ACG operations 33 Hawks as trainers, and these aircraft {{have a limited}} air-to-air and land strike capability.

5|$|The Lockheed D-21 was an American {{reconnaissance}} drone with {{maximum speed}} {{in excess of}} Mach3.3 (2,215mph; 3,564km/h). The D-21 was initially designed to be launched {{from the back of}} a M-21 carrier aircraft, <b>a</b> <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lockheed A-12 aircraft. Development began in October 1962. Originally known by the Lockheed designation Q-12, the drone was intended for reconnaissance deep in enemy airspace.|$|E

5|$|The same distigmai were {{observed}} in Codex Fuldensis, especially in the section containing 1 Cor 14:34–35. The distigme of two codices indicate <b>a</b> <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western manuscripts, which placed 1 Cor 14:34–35 after 1 Cor 14:40 (manuscripts: Claromontanus, Augiensis, Boernerianus, 88, itd, g, and some manuscripts of Vulgate).|$|E

5|$|There is also modest {{evidence}} that genetic factors influence the prognosis in SAH. For example, having {{two copies of}} ApoE4 (<b>a</b> <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gene encoding apolipoprotein E that also {{plays a role in}} Alzheimer's disease) seems to increase risk for delayed ischemia and a worse outcome. The occurrence of hyperglycemia (high blood sugars) after an episode of SAH confers a higher risk of poor outcome.|$|E
5|$|Tianyulong from China {{appears to}} {{preserve}} filamentous integument {{which has been}} interpreted to be <b>a</b> <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proto-feathers found in some theropods. These filaments include a crest along its tail. The presence of this filamentous integument {{has been used to}} suggest that both ornithischians and saurischians were endothermic.|$|E

Centralised Traffic Control was also introduced in the 1960s on the new standard gauge line to Albury, {{and then on the}} main interstate line to Adelaide, allowing trains to be directed from a distance.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{extended}} version used in desert border patrol {{makes use of}} a high-ceilinged canopy to allow a swivelling rear-facing heavy machine-gun mount, while the canopy can be extended to provide a mobile command post. An air conditioned hardtop version of the extended model is often used by officers, and a version developed for riot control has clear polycarbonate shielding along the rear sides and roof, as well as gunports for less-lethal weapons. The shielding allows for a wide field of view {{while at the same}} time protecting against firebombs and rock-throwing.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minimax path {{problem has}} also been {{considered}} for sets of points in the Euclidean plane. As in the undirected graph problem, this Euclidean minimax path problem can be solved efficiently by finding a Euclidean minimum spanning tree: every path in the tree is a minimax path. However, the problem becomes more complicated when a path is desired that not only minimizes the hop length but also, among paths with the same hop length, minimizes or approximately minimizes the total length of the path. The solution can be approximated using geometric spanners.|$|E

5|$|Forty {{years earlier}} than de Tournefort, de Thévenot {{described}} {{much the same}} process, adding that it was seldom used because it was regarded as too cruel. Some 80 years prior to de Thevenot, in 1579, Hans Jacob Breuning von Buchenbach witnessed <b>a</b> <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gaunching ritual. A large iron hook was fixed on the horizontal cross-bar of the gallows and the individual was forced upon this hook, piercing him from the abdomen through his back, so that he hung from it, hands, feet and head downward. On top of the cross bar, the executioner situated himself and performed various torture on the impaled man below him.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club (PJRTC) was {{reformed}} {{with the}} aim of seeking Kennel Club recognition for the breed. The initial application was turned down, but after several further rejections, the Parson Jack Russell Terrier was recognised on 9 January 1990 as <b>a</b> <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fox Terrier, with the United Kennel Club following suit in 1991. The American Kennel Club recognised the breed as the Jack Russell Terrier effective 1 November 1997.|$|E
