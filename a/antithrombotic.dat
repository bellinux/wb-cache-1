5|$|Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly {{blocks the}} {{formation}} of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This <b>antithrombotic</b> property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in {{people who have had}} a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. 40mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.|$|E
5|$|When {{warfarin}} is newly started, it may promote clot formation temporarily. This {{is because}} the level of protein C and protein S are also dependent on vitamin K activity. Warfarin causes decline in protein C levels in first 36 hours. In addition, reduced levels of protein S lead {{to a reduction in}} activity of protein C (for which it is the co-factor) and therefore reduced degradation of factor Va and factor VIIIa. Although loading doses of warfarin over 5mg also produce a precipitous decline in factor VII, resulting in an initial prolongation of the INR, full <b>antithrombotic</b> effect does not take place until significant reduction in factor II occurs days later. The haemostasis system becomes temporarily biased towards thrombus formation, leading to a prothrombotic state. Thus, when warfarin is loaded rapidly at greater than 5mg per day, it is beneficial to co-administer heparin, an anticoagulant that acts upon antithrombin and helps reduce the risk of thrombosis, with warfarin therapy for four to five days, in order to have the benefit of anticoagulation from heparin until the full effect of warfarin has been achieved.|$|E

40|$|Backgrounds: There {{have been}} neither {{appropriate}} guidelines nor clinical studies {{about the use}} of <b>antithrombotics</b> after hemorrhagic transformation (HT). We sought to find whether the use of <b>antithrombotics</b> after hemorrhagic infarction might be associated with aggravation of HT and neurological deterioration. Methods: This retrospective study included prospectively registered consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke and HT in our tertiary stroke center. We focused on the hemorrhagic infarction. Aggravation of HT was defined as either enlargement of the original HT or newly developed HT within the infarcted area by visual analysis. We analyzed relationships between <b>antithrombotics</b> and HT, and neurological deterioration after HT in patients with hemorrhagic infarction. In addition, we assessed composite outcomes including neurological deterioration, vascular events, and death at 1 month after HT. We analyzed relationships between <b>antithrombotics</b> after discharge and composite outcomes within 1 month after HT. Results: 222 patients were finally analyzed. Of the 150 patients with hemorrhagic infarction, 75 (50. 0 %) were type 1. The use of warfarin after detection of hemorrhagic infarction more frequently increased aggravation of HT than did the use of antiplatelets (4 of 24 vs 3 of 69; p = 0. 094), but neither warfarin nor antiplatelets caused more HT than no medication. In addition, the use of <b>antithrombotics</b> after hemorrhagic infarction was not significantly associated with neurologica...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: Ischaemic stroke {{patients}} with atrial fibrillation (AF) {{are at risk}} of early recurrent stroke (RS).

The associations of <b>antithrombotics</b> with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) outcome and the occurrence of RS and SICH (each as a combined end-point of fatal and non-fatal events) at 90  days for post-stroke {{patients with}} AF were described.

40|$|Neutralizing the {{interaction}} of the platelet receptor gpIb with VWF is an attractive strategy to treat and prevent thrombotic complications. ALX- 0081 is a bivalent Nanobody which specifically targets the gpIb-binding site of VWF and interacts avidly with VWF. Nanobodies are therapeutic proteins derived from naturally occurring heavy-chain - only Abs and combine a small molecular size with a high inherent stability. ALX- 0081 exerts potent activity in vitro and in vivo. Perfusion experiments with blood from patients with acute coronary syndrome on standard <b>antithrombotics</b> demonstrated complete inhibition of platelet adhesion after addition of ALX- 0081, while in the absence of ALX- 0081 residual adhesion was observed. In a baboon efficacy and safety model measuring acute thrombosis and surgical bleeding, ALX- 0081 showed a superior therapeutic window compared with marketed <b>antithrombotics.</b> Pharmacokinetic and biodistribution experiments demonstrated target-mediated clearance of ALX- 0081, which leads to a self-regulating disposition behavior.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of bowel dysfunction in hemiplegic patients, and {{its relationship with the}} site of neurological lesion, physical immobilization and pharmacotherapy. METHODS: Ninety consecutive hemiplegic patients and 81 consecutive orthopedic patients were investigated during physical motor rehabilitation in the same period, in the same center and on the same diet. All subjects were interviewed >= 3 mo after injury using a questionnaire inquiring about bowel habits before injury and {{at the time of the}} interview. Patients' mobility was evaluated by the Adapted Patient Evaluation Conference System. Drugs considered for the analysis were nitrates, angiogenic converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, anticoagulants, <b>antithrombotics,</b> antidepressants, anti-epileptics. RESULTS: Mobility scores were similar in the two groups. De novo constipation (OR = 5. 36) was a frequent outcome of the neurological accident. Hemiplegics showed an increased risk of straining at stool (OR: 4. 33), reduced call to evacuate (OR: 4. 13), sensation of incomplete evacuation (OR: 3. 69), use of laxatives (OR: 3. 75). Logistic regression model showed that constipation was significantly and independently associated with hemiplegia. A positive association was found between constipation and use of nitrates and <b>antithrombotics</b> in both groups. Constipation was not related to the site of brain injury. CONCLUSION: Chronic constipation is a possible outcome of cerebrovascular accidents occurring in 30 % of neurologically stabilized hemiplegic patients. Its onset after a cerebrovascular accident appears to be independent from the injured brain hemisphere, and unrelated to physical inactivity. Pharmacological treatment with nitrates and <b>antithrombotics</b> may represent an independent risk factor for developing chronic constipation. (c) 2007 WJG. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme, {{the most}} {{frequent}} type of primary brain tumor, is a rapidly evolving and spatially heterogeneous high-grade astrocytoma that presents areas of necrosis, hypercellularity and microvascular hyperplasia. The aberrant vasculature leads to hypoxic areas and results in an increase of the oxidative stress selecting for more invasive tumor cell phenotypes. In our study we assay in silico different therapeutic approaches which combine <b>antithrombotics,</b> antioxidants and standard radiotherapy. To do so, we have developed a biocomputational model of glioblastoma multiforme that incorporates the spatio-temporal interplay among two glioma cell phenotypes corresponding to oxygenated and hypoxic cells, a necrotic core and the local vasculature whose response evolves with tumor progression. Our numerical simulations predict that suitable combinations of <b>antithrombotics</b> and antioxidants may diminish, in a synergetic way, oxidative stress and the subsequent hypoxic response. This novel therapeutical strategy, with potentially low or no toxicity, might reduce tumor invasion and further sensitize glioblastoma multiforme to conventional radiotherapy or other cytotoxic agents, hopefully increasing median patient overall survival time.
