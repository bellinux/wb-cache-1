RD cells attached to and spread on plastic plates coatce with each lectin. Cell adhesion by the frog lectin was completely inhibited {{by the addition}} of lactose or asialofetuin glycopeptide. Echinoidin-induced cell adhesion was only inhibited by peptide GRGDS. Since echinoidin is known to contain an RGD-sequence, our results clearly indicate that this sequence is active as the cell <b>adhesive</b> <b>signal.</b> These results suggest that some of the animal lectins may function as a cell adhesive molecule rather than using the carbohydrate-recognition mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Cadherins, {{a family}} of Ca-dependent {{adhesion}} molecules, have been proposed to act as regulators of morphogenetic processes and to be major effectors in the maintenance of tissue integrity. In this study, we have compared {{the effects of the}} expression of two truncated cadherins during early neurogenesis in Xenopus laevis. mRNA encoding deleted forms of XB- and N-cadherin lacking most of the extracellular domain were injected into the four animal dorsal blastomeres of 32 -cell stage Xenopus embryos. These truncated cadherins altered the cohesion of cells derived from the injected blastomeres and induced morphogenetic defects in the anterior neural tissue to which they chiefly contributed. Truncated XB-cadherin was more efficient than N- cadherin in inducing these perturbations. Moreover, the coexpression of both truncated cadherins had additive perturbation effects on neural development. The two truncated cadherins can interact with the three known catenins, but with distinct affinities. These results suggest that the <b>adhesive</b> <b>signal</b> mediated by cadherins can be perturbed by overexpressing their cytoplasmic domains by competing with different affinity with catenins and/or a common anchor structure. Therefore, the correct regulation of cadherin function through the cytoplasmic domain appears to be a crucial step {{in the formation of the}} neural tissue...|$|E
40|$|Biophysical {{signals are}} known to {{influence}} cell fate and functions. In particular, topographic cues exert a direct control over focal adhesions positioning and cytoskeletal assemblies. Moreover, the nuclear envelope is directly connected to the cytoskeleton and actin generated stresses can directly impact on nuclear shape and gene matter configuration. However, how topographic patterns might influence the processes above or more generally, cellular and nuclear mechanics is still unclear. The goal of this work is to investigate how the microenvironmental conditions in terms of topographic cues, substrate chemistry and cell-cell contacts may alter the cell morphology, along with cellular and nuclear mechanics. In a first set of experiments we used nanopatterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as cell culturing substrates. The patterns consisted of parallel and straight channels having ridge to groove width ratio of 1 : 1. Pattern features used were 700 nm or 350 nm wide with depth of 250 nm or 100 nm respectively. Additionally, the chemistry of the material surface was modified by performing different functionalization treatments, namely fibronectin or serum coating. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSC) were cultured at low densities on the substrates up to 48 h. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was employed to generate elasticity maps of the whole cell body. We then correlated local elastic modulus with cell height in order to discriminate the different cellular regions. Our analysis showed structural and mechanical heterogeneity of the cell body, clearly mediated by topographic and <b>adhesive</b> <b>signal.</b> In particular, the spindle like phenotype observed on the nanopatterned materials generates compressive forces on the nucleus, which increase its mechanical properties. Our results also demonstrated {{a positive correlation between}} the expression of lamins A / C, the structural proteins of the nucleus, and the mechanical properties of the nuclear region. Therefore it is reasonable to hypothesize that these proteins have a primary role in dictating the mechanical properties of the nucleus. In a second setup, we used endothelial cells (HUVECs) on flat PDMS substrates to investigate the effect of cell-cell contacts on cytoskeletal assembly and nuclear mechanics. We found that actin is redistributed in the cortical area, freeing the nucleus, which exhibits a mechanical conformation characterized by lower moduli than single cells. Our results pave the way for capturing designing concept to fabricate novel patterned platforms that effectively alters nuclear mechanics and possibly cell fate by tuning the material-cytoskeleton-nucleus crosstalk...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIn {{response}} to microenvironmental cues, embryonic cells form <b>adhesive</b> <b>signaling</b> compartments that influence survival and patterning. Dividing cells detach {{from the surrounding}} matrix and initiate extensive membrane remodeling, but the in vivo impact of mitosis on adhesion-dependent signaling remains poorly characterized. We investigate in vivo signaling dynamics using the invertebrate chordate, Ciona intestinalis. In Ciona, matrix adhesion polarizes fibroblast growth factor (FGF) -dependent heart progenitor induction. Here, we show that adhesion inhibits mitotic FGF receptor internalization, leading to receptor enrichment along adherent membranes. Targeted disruption of matrix adhesion promotes uniform FGF receptor internalization and degradation while enhanced adhesion suppresses degradation. Chimeric analysis indicates that integrin β chain-specific impacts on induction are dictated by distinct internalization motifs. We also found that matrix adhesion impacts receptor enrichment through Caveolin-rich membrane domains. These results redefine the relationship between cell division and <b>adhesive</b> <b>signaling,</b> revealing how mitotic membrane turnover orchestrates adhesion-dependent signal polarization...|$|R
40|$|Tissue repair {{requires}} that fibroblasts migrate into the wound {{to produce and}} remodel extracellular matrix, a process that requires adhesion. Failure to suppress the tissue repair program results in fibrotic disorders that are characterized by excessive <b>adhesive</b> <b>signaling.</b> The role of specific components of <b>adhesive</b> <b>signaling</b> in fibrogenic responses is unclear, but may involve small GTPases such as Rac 1. To address the functions of Rac 1 in fibroblasts, we generated mice containing a fibroblast-specific deletion of Rac 1. These mice show delayed cutaneous wound closure, including reduced collagen production and myofibroblast formation. In cultured Rac 1 -deficient fibroblasts, adhesion, spreading, and migration were significantly inhibited. Rac 1 -deficient fibroblasts possessed impaired myofibroblast formation and function as visualized by reduced α-smooth muscle actin expression as well as matrix contraction. Both in vivo and in vitro, Rac 1 - deficient fibroblasts showed a reduced generation of reactive oxygen species; in vitro, hydrogen peroxide alleviated the phenotype of Rac 1 -deficient fibroblasts. Thus, Rac 1 is an essential signaling integrator that is required for normal wound healing and dermal homeostasis...|$|R

Therefore, equilibrium between cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and matrix-associated signals are important for the normal functioning of cells, {{as well as for}} regeneration. In this work, we describe importance of <b>adhesive</b> <b>signals</b> for myoblast cells' growth and differentiation by generating a novel ECM mimetic peptide nanofiber scaffold system. We show that not only structure but also composition of bioactive signals are important for cell adhesion, growth and differentiation by mimicking the compositional and structural properties of native skeletal muscle basal lamina. We conjugated laminin-derived integrin binding peptide sequence, "IKVAV", and fibronectin-derived well known adhesive sequence, "RGD", into peptide nanostructures to provide adhesive and myogenic cues on a nanofibrous morphology. The myogenic and <b>adhesive</b> <b>signals</b> exhibited a synergistic effect on model myoblasts, C 2 C 12 cells. Our results showed that self-assembled peptide nanofibers presenting laminin derived epitopes support adhesion, growth and proliferation of the cells and significantly promote the expression of skeletal muscle-specific marker genes. The functional peptide nanofibers used in this study present a biocompatible and biodegradable microenvironment, which is capable of supporting the growth and differentiation of C 2 C 12 myoblasts into myotubes...|$|R

Although genome-wide expression profiling has suggested that differences in gene expression patters between non-lesional and lesional skin are minimal, phenotypically these areas of tissue are quite different. In fact, lesional areas of scleroderma patients can be distinguished {{by the presence of}} a differentiated form of fibroblast, termed the myofibroblast. This cell type expresses the highly contractile protein smooth muscle actin (SMA). Fibroblasts isolated from SSc lesions excessively synthesize, adhere to and contract extracellular matrix (ECM) and display activated <b>adhesive</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways. Strategies aimed at blocking myofibroblast differentiation, persistence and activity are therefore likely to be useful in alleviating the fibrosis in scleroderma...|$|R
40|$|<b>Adhesive</b> <b>signaling</b> plays a {{key role}} in {{cellular}} differentiation, including in chondrogenesis. Herein, we probe the contribution to early chondrogenesis of two key modulators of adhesion, namely focal adhesion kinase (FAK) /Src and CCN 2 (connective tissue growth factor, CTGF). We use the micromass model of chondrogenesis to show that FAK/Src signaling, which mediates cell/matrix attachment, suppresses early chondrogenesis, including the induction of Ccn 2, Agc, and Sox 6. The FAK/Src inhibitor PP 2 elevates Ccn 2, Agc, and Sox 6 expression in wild-type mesenchymal cells in micromass culture, but not in cells lacking CCN 2. Our results suggest a reduction in FAK/Src signaling is a critical feature permitting chondrogenic differentiation and that CCN 2 operates downstream of this loss to promote chondrogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Focal {{adhesion}} kinase (FAK) is {{an essential}} nonreceptor tyrosine kinase regulating cell migration, <b>adhesive</b> <b>signaling,</b> and mechanosensing. Using FAK-null cells expressing FAK under an inducible promoter, we demonstrate that FAK regulates the time-dependent generation of adhesive forces. During {{the early stages of}} adhesion, FAK expression in FAK-null cells enhances integrin activation to promote integrin binding and, hence, the adhesion strengthening rate. Importantly, FAK expression regulated integrin activation, and talin was required for the FAK-dependent effects. A role for FAK in integrin activation was confirmed in human fibroblasts with knocked-down FAK expression. The FAK autophosphorylation Y 397 site was required for the enhancements in adhesion strengthening and integrin-binding responses. This work demonstrates a novel role for FAK in integrin activation and the time-dependent generation of cell–ECM forces...|$|R
40|$|During T-cell migration, cell {{polarity}} is {{orchestrated by}} chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules and in-volves the functional redistribution of molecules and organelles towards specific cell compartments. In contrast, {{it is generally}} believed that the cell polarity established when T cells meet antigen-presenting cells (APCs) {{is controlled by the}} triggered T-cell receptor (TCR). Here, we show that, during activation of human T lymphocytes by APCs, chemokines and LFA- 1 establish cell polarity independently of TCR triggering. Chemokine-induced LFA- 1 activation results in fast recruitment of MTOC and mitochondria towards the potential APC, a process required to amplify TCR Ca 2 þ signalling at the upcoming immunological synapse, to promote nuclear translocation of transcriptional factor NFATc 2 and boost CD 25 expres-sion.

40|$|Intracellular calcium flux is {{an early}} step in the {{signaling}} cascade that bridges ligation of selectin and chemokine receptors to activation of adhesive and motile functions during recruitment on inflamed endothelium. Calcium flux was imaged in real time and provided a means of correlating signaling events in neutrophils rolling on E-selectin and stimulated by chemokine in a microfluidic chamber. Integrin dependent neutrophil arrest was triggered by E-selectin tethering and ligation of IL- 8 seconds before a rapid rise in intracellular calcium, which {{was followed by the}} onset of pseudopod formation. Calcium flux on rolling neutrophils increased in a shear dependent manner, and served to link integrin adhesion and signaling of cytoskeletally driven cell polarization. Abolishing calcium influx through membrane expressed store operated calcium channels inhibited activation of high affinity β 2 integrin and subsequent cell arrest. We conclude that calcium influx at the plasma membrane integrates chemotactic and <b>adhesive</b> <b>signals,</b> and functions to synchronize signaling of neutrophil arrest and migration in a shear stress dependent manner...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{wound healing}} {{involves}} tightly controlled regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and remodeling, and myofibroblast-mediated wound contraction, to restore normal tissue function. However, these events involved in healing are {{also associated with}} development of tissue fibrosis, which is characterized by excessive deposition of ECM {{and the presence of}} myofibroblasts. Increasing evidence suggests that periostin is a critical player in regulating skin healing and fibrosis. In contrast to most adult tissues, gingival connective tissue is known to heal more rapidly and with less scarring, yet is still associated with fibrosis, such as drug-induced gingival enlargement. The aim {{of this study is to}} understand the mechanism of gingival healing and fibrosis, and to describe the role of periostin. Chapter 2 demonstrates that during wound healing of rat gingiva, periostin upregulation coincides with collagen and fibronectin deposition, while only few myofibroblasts are evident. Although periostin has no influence over myofibroblast differentiation of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs), it induces synthesis of collagen and fibronectin proteins. Chapters 3 - 4 and Appendix 4 show that periostin is highly upregulated by nifedipine and phenytoin in gingiva, and the drugs increase periostin through TGF-b signaling in HGFs. Such increase of periostin also coincides with greater ECM deposition, while myofibroblasts are absent. As <b>adhesive</b> <b>signaling</b> is critical in myofibroblast differentiation, Chapter 5 demonstrates that HGFs cultured on smooth titanium topography have more mature focal adhesions and greater phosphorylated-focal adhesion kinase, compared to HGFs on rough substratum. HGFs cultured on smooth titanium are also associated with greater gene expressions of periostin and CCN 2, fibronectin deposition, and more myofibroblast differentiation, compared to HGFs on rough topography. The overall findings from this thesis are that periostin is a pro-fibrotic protein in gingiva, where it increases matrix synthesis, but not myofibroblast differentiation of gingival fibroblasts, to regulate healing as well as contributing to fibrosis. While seemingly not normally active in gingival fibroblasts, <b>adhesive</b> <b>signaling</b> can be induced resulting in the cells assuming a fibrotic phenotype. Furthermore, this study shows that increased stiffness of the culture substratum does not induce myofibroblast differentiation if cell attachment sites are physically restricted...|$|R
40|$|According to the {{prevailing}} paradigm neutrophils are short-lived cells that undergo spontaneous apoptosis within 24 hours of their release from the bone marrow. However, neutrophil survival can be significantly prolonged within inflamed tissue by cytokines, inflammatory mediators and hypoxia. During screening experiments aimed at identifying {{the effect of the}} adhesive microenvironment on neutrophil survival, we found that VCAM- 1 (CD 106) was able to delay both spontaneous and Fas-induced apoptosis. VCAM- 1 mediated survival was as efficient as that induced by the cytokine IFN- and provided an additive, increased delay in apoptosis when given in combination with IFN-. VCAM- 1 delivered its anti-apoptotic effect through binding the integrin 91. The 91 signaling pathway shares significant features with the IFN- survival signaling pathway; requiring PI 3 Kinase, NF-B activation as well as de novo protein synthesis, but the kinetics of NF-B activation by VCAM- 1 were slower and more sustained compared to IFN-.

40|$|The {{fibronectin}} receptors alpha(5) beta(1) integrin and syndecan- 4 cocluster in focal adhesions {{and coordinate}} cell migration by making individual {{contributions to the}} suppression of RhoA activity during matrix engagement. p 190 Rho-guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein (GAP) is known to inhibit RhoA {{during the early stages}} of cell spreading in an Src-dependent manner. This paper dissects the mechanisms of p 190 RhoGAP regulation and distinguishes the contributions of alpha(5) beta(1) integrin and syndecan- 4. Matrix-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p 190 RhoGAP is stimulated solely by engagement of alpha(5) beta(1) integrin and is independent of syndecan- 4. Parallel engagement of syndecan- 4 causes redistribution of the tyrosine-phosphorylated pool of p 190 RhoGAP between membrane and cytosolic fractions by a mechanism that requires direct activation of protein kinase C alpha by syndecan- 4. Activation of both pathways is necessary for the efficient regulation of RhoA and, as a consequence, focal adhesion formation. Accordingly, we identify p 190 RhoGAP as the convergence point for <b>adhesive</b> <b>signals</b> mediated by alpha(5) beta(1) integrin and syndecan- 4. This molecular mechanism explains the cooperation between extracellular matrix receptors during cell adhesion...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe FERM domain protein Merlin, encoded by the NF 2 tumor {{suppressor}} gene, regulates {{cell proliferation}} {{in response to}} <b>adhesive</b> <b>signaling.</b> The growth inhibitory function of Merlin is induced by intercellular adhesion and inactivated by joint integrin/receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Merlin contributes {{to the formation of}} cell junctions in polarized tissues, activates anti-mitogenic signaling at tight-junctions, and inhibits oncogenic gene expression. Thus, inactivation of Merlin causes uncontrolled mitogenic signaling and tumorigenesis. Merlin’s predominant tumor suppressive functions are attributable to its control of oncogenic gene expression through regulation of Hippo signaling. Notably, Merlin translocates to the nucleus where it directly inhibits the CRL 4 DCAF 1 E 3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby suppressing inhibition of the Lats kinases. A dichotomy in NF 2 function has emerged whereby Merlin acts at the cell cortex to organize cell junctions and propagate anti-mitogenic signaling, whereas it inhibits oncogenic gene expression through the inhibition of CRL 4 DCAF 1 and activation of Hippo signaling. The biochemical events underlying Merlin’s normal function and tumor suppressive activity will be discussed in this Review, with emphasis on recent discoveries that have greatly influenced our understanding of Merlin biology...|$|R
40|$|Ovarian {{cancer is}} {{a leading cause of}} death in women, and despite primary treatment, the {{majority}} of patients relapse. As the cancer becomes chemoresistant, prognosis dramatically worsens. Metastasis, or the spread of cancer, is the primary cause of death in more than 90 % of ovarian cancers. Taxol, a frontline chemotherapeutic drug, works by stabilizing microtubules, cytoskeletal filaments required for cell division. While it is known that microtubules affect cell adhesion, it remains unclear if chemoresistance alters cell adhesion to the extracellular environment. We tested this by isolating Taxol-resistant cells, which displayed increased microtubule dynamics characterized by more rapid microtubule growth from fluorescently labeled EB 3 microtubule protein. Additionally, they displayed faster adhesion rates and decreased adhesion strength, which could help overcome the rate-limiting step of metastasis. Adhesion strength was found to be independent of microtubule polymerization and dependent on up-regulated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in the Taxol-resistant cells. Upon inhibition of FAK in these cells, microtubule dynamics decreased, signifying that <b>adhesive</b> <b>signaling</b> is up-stream of microtubule dynamics. Hence, by altering cell adhesion to the extracellular environment, Taxol-resistant cells show an increase in down-stream microtubule dynamics. This study consequently used FAK inhibition as a therapeutic target to improve prognosis by regaining drug sensitivity. Undergraduat...|$|R
40|$|AbstractProper {{remodeling}} of the endocardial cushions {{into thin}} fibrous valves {{is essential for}} gestational progression and long-term function. This process involves dynamic interactions between resident cells and their local environment, much of which is not understood. In this study, we show that deficiency of the cell–cell adhesion protein cadherin- 11 (Cad- 11) results in significant embryonic and perinatal lethality primarily due to valve related cardiac dysfunction. While endocardial to mesenchymal transformation is not abrogated, mesenchymal cells do not homogeneously cellularize the cushions. These cushions remain thickened with disorganized ECM, resulting in pronounced aortic valve insufficiency. Mice that survive to adulthood maintain thickened and stenotic semilunar valves, but interestingly do not develop calcification. Cad- 11 −/− aortic valve leaflets contained reduced Sox 9 activity, β 1 integrin expression, and RhoA-GTP activity, suggesting that remodeling defects are due to improper migration and/or cellular contraction. Cad- 11 deletion or siRNA knockdown reduced migration, eliminated collective migration, and impaired 3 D matrix compaction by aortic valve interstitial cells (VIC). Cad- 11 depleted cells in culture contained few filopodia, stress fibers, or contact inhibited locomotion. Transfection of Cad- 11 depleted cells with constitutively active RhoA restored cell phenotypes.

However, due to their scarcity in the circulation there is a requirement for ex vivo expansion before they could provide a practical cell therapy and it is currently unclear if they would home and engraft to an injury site. Using an in vitro flow system we studied LO-EPC under simulated injury conditions including EC activation, ischaemia, disrupted EC integrity, and exposed basement membrane. Perfused LO-EPC adhered to discontinuous EC paracellularly at junctional regions between adjacent cells under shear stress 0. 7 [*]dyn/cm 2. The interaction was not adhesion molecule-dependent and not enhanced by EC activation. LO-EPC expressed high levels of the VE-Cadherin which may explain these findings. Ischaemia reperfusion injury decreased the interaction with LO-EPC due to cell retraction. LO-EPC interacted with exposed extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, fibronectin and vitronectin.

40|$|SummarySrc is a nonreceptor {{tyrosine}} kinase that coordinates responses to diverse soluble and <b>adhesive</b> <b>signaling</b> molecules and regulates cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and migration [1]. Normally, Src activity is tightly regulated, and Src-catalyzed phosphorylation is counterbalanced by phosphotyrosine phosphatases [2, 3]. However, deregulated mutant Src causes malignant transformation when highly expressed [4]. Src transformation is dose dependent, {{but it has}} been unclear how much mutant Src, compared with endogenous Src, is required for transformation [5]. Here, we show that transformation requires high-level overexpression of mutant src mRNA, in part because active Src protein is degraded by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis [6]. We show that active but not inactive Src protein is downregulated depending on the putative tumor suppressor and E 3 ubiquitin ligase component, Cullin- 5 (Cul 5). Cul 5 removal synergizes with physiological levels of mutant src mRNA to increase protein tyrosine phosphorylation, induce morphological transformation, and deregulate growth. Cul 5 also represses Src-induced tumorigenesis and regulates Src signaling in normal cells. These results suggest that, when Src is activated by mutation or physiological mechanisms, its effects are limited by Cul 5, which downregulates active Src and its phosphorylated substrates.

40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), {{the most}} {{prevalent}} primary brain cancer, is characterized by diffuse infiltration of tumor cells into brain tissue, which severely complicates surgical resection and contributes to tumor recurrence. The most rapid mode of tissue infiltration occurs along blood vessels or white matter tracts, which represent topological interfaces thought to serve as "tracks" that speed cell migration. Despite this observation, the field lacks experimental paradigms that capture key features of these tissue interfaces and allow reductionist dissection of mechanisms of this interfacial motility. To address this need, we developed a culture system in which tumor cells are sandwiched between a fibronectin-coated ventral surface representing vascular basement membrane and a dorsal hyaluronic acid (HA) surface representing brain parenchyma. We find that inclusion of the dorsal HA surface induces formation of adhesive complexes and significantly slows cell migration relative to a free fibronectin-coated surface. This retardation is amplified by inclusion of integrin binding peptides in the dorsal layer and expression of CD 44, suggesting that the dorsal surface slows migration through biochemically specific mechanisms rather than simple steric hindrance. Moreover, both the reduction in migration speed and assembly of dorsal adhesions depend on myosin activation and the stiffness of the ventral layer, implying that mechanochemical feedback directed by the ventral layer can influence <b>adhesive</b> <b>signaling</b> at the dorsal surface. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundEstablishment and {{maintenance}} of epithelial cell polarity is regulated in part by signaling from adhesion receptors. Loss of cell polarity is associated with multiple pathologies including the initiation and progression of various cancers. The β 1 -integrin adhesion receptor {{plays a role in}} the regulation of cell polarity; however, the identity of the signaling pathways that modulate β 1 -integrin function and connect it to the regulation of polarity pathways remains largely unknown. ResultsThe present work identifies a role for Arg, a member of the Abl family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, in the regulation of <b>adhesive</b> <b>signals</b> and epithelial cell polarity. In a three-dimensional cell culture model, activation of Arg kinase leads to a striking inversion of apical-basal polarity. In contrast, loss of Arg function impairs the establishment of a polarized epithelial cyst structure. Activated Arg kinase disrupts β 1 -integrin signaling and localization and impairs Rac 1 -mediated laminin assembly. Disruption of β 1 -integrin function by active Arg results in altered distribution of selected polarity complex components mediated in part by Rap 1 GTPase signaling. Whereas polarity inversion is partially rescued by a constitutively active Rap 1, Rac 1 -dependent laminin assembly is not, indicating that Rap 1 and Rac 1 signal independently during epithelial polarity. ConclusionsThese findings suggest that modulation of Arg kinase function may contribute not only to normal epithelial polarity regulation but also may promote pathologies associated with loss of cell polarity...|$|R

40|$|Integrins are <b>adhesive,</b> <b>signaling,</b> and mechanotransduction proteins. Talin (Tln) {{activates}} integrins {{and links}} {{it to the}} actin cytoskeleton. Vertebrates contain two talin genes, tln 1 and tln 2. How Tln 1 and Tln 2 function in cardiac myocytes (CMs) is unknown. Tln 1 and Tln 2 expression were evaluated in the normal embryonic and adult mouse heart {{as well as in}} control and failing human adult myocardium. Tln 1 function was then tested in the basal and mechanically stressed myocardium after cardiomyocyte-specific excision of the Tln 1 gene. During embryogenesis, both Tln forms are highly expressed in CMs, but in the mature heart Tln 2 becomes the main Tln isoform, localizing to the costameres. Tln 1 expression is minimal in the adult CM. With pharmacological and mechanical stress causing hypertrophy, Tln 1 is up-regulated in CMs and is specifically detected at costameres, suggesting its importance in the compensatory response to CM stress. In human failing heart, CM Tln 1 also increases compared with control samples from normal functioning myocardium. To directly test Tln 1 function in CMs, we generated CM-specific Tln 1 knock-out mice (Tln 1 cKO). Tln 1 cKO mice showed normal basal cardiac structure and function but when subjected to pressure overload showed blunted hypertrophy, less fibrosis, and improved cardiac function versus controls. Acute responses of ERK 1 / 2, p 38, Akt, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 after mechanical stress were strongly blunted in Tln 1 cKO mice. Given these results, we conclude that Tln 1 and Tln 2 have distinct functions in the myocardium. Our data show that reduction of CM Tln 1 expression can lead to improved cardiac remodeling following pressure overload.

40|$|Fox, Joseph M. The {{research}} in my doctoral study {{consists of two}} major parts. One part is a synthetic method development and its applications in solving complex synthetic chemistry problems. The other part is a multidisciplinary {{research in}}volving the collaboration of the Fox group and the Jia group in material science, studying {{the development of new}} biomaterials for cell culture purpose. ☐ Butenolides are privileged scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and important synthetic building blocks. Allyl cyclopropene carboxylates undergo ring expansion reaction to give alloxyfuran intermediates, which can further rearrange to Δβ, γ butenolides via Claisen rearrangement or Δα, β butenolides via a further Cope rearrangement. The chemoselectivity and regioselectivity can be controlled through judicious choice of catalyst and reaction temperature. The transformation is stereospecific and transfers the chirality of the allyl cyclopropene carboxylate to the butenolide product. Through assignment of the absolute configuration of the product, it was possible to propose a mechanistic model for the rearrangements. ☐ The second chapter centers on the application of the butenolide formation method described in chapter one towards the total synthesis of sessilifoliamide nature products. The route features a one-step installation of the butenolide moiety to furnish the dehydro-sessilifoliamide from a cyclopropene carboxylate precursor and a short and efficient synthesis of the cyclopropene carboxylate. A short 11 -step synthesis of dehydro sessilifoliamide B is described. Attempts to prepare sessilifoliamide B by hydrogenation were unsuccessful. ☐ The third chapter describes a collaborative research on the development of biomaterial for cell culture purpose using tetrazine ligation. The chapter describes the development of chemical tools for the hydrogel preparation. The mechanical properties of hydrogels were controlled by introducing capping groups alongside crosslinker molecules in interfacial crosslinking events. Enzyme degradable crosslinkers and cell <b>adhesive</b> <b>signals</b> are prepared and introduced to the gels. It was shown by my collaborator that all the newly developed chemical tools can be incorporated in to the HA-Tz based hydrogels and NIH 3 T 3 cells can be cultured in the system with good viability and morphology.

40|$|We {{previously}} demonstrated contrasting {{roles for}} integrin α subunits and their cytoplasmic domains in controlling cell cycle withdrawal and {{the onset of}} terminal differentiation (Sastry, S., M. Lakonishok, D. Thomas, J. Muschler, and A. F. Horwitz. 1996. J. Cell Biol. 133 : 169 – 184). Ectopic expression of the integrin α 5 or α 6 A subunit in primary quail myoblasts either decreases or enhances the probability of cell cycle withdrawal, respectively. In this study, we addressed the mechanisms by which changes in integrin α subunit ratios regulate this decision. Ectopic expression of truncated α 5 or α 6 A indicate that the α 5 cytoplasmic domain is permissive for the proliferative pathway whereas the COOH-terminal 11 amino acids of α 6 A cytoplasmic domain inhibit proliferation and promote differentiation. The α 5 and α 6 A cytoplasmic domains {{do not appear to}} initiate these signals directly, but instead regulate β 1 signaling. Ectopically expressed IL 2 R-α 5 or IL 2 R-α 6 A have no detectable effect on the myoblast phenotype. However, ectopic expression of the β 1 A integrin subunit or IL 2 R-β 1 A, autonomously inhibits differentiation and maintains a proliferative state. Perturbing α 5 or α 6 A ratios also significantly affects activation of β 1 integrin signaling pathways. Ectopic α 5 expression enhances expression and activation of paxillin as well as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase with little effect on focal adhesion kinase (FAK). In contrast, ectopic α 6 A expression suppresses FAK and MAP kinase activation with a lesser effect on paxillin. Ectopic expression of wild-type and mutant forms of FAK, paxillin, and MAP/erk kinase (MEK) confirm these correlations. These data demonstrate that (a) proliferative signaling (i. e., inhibition of cell cycle withdrawal and the onset of terminal differentiation) occurs through the β 1 A subunit and is modulated by the α subunit cytoplasmic domains; (b) perturbing α subunit ratios alters paxillin expression and phosphorylation and FAK and MAP kinase activation; (c) quantitative changes in the level of <b>adhesive</b> <b>signaling</b> through integrins and focal adhesion components regulate the decision of myoblasts to withdraw from the cell cycle, in part via MAP kinase...|$|R
40|$|Objective Enhanced <b>adhesive</b> <b>signaling,</b> {{including}} {{activation of}} focal adhesion kinase (FAK), is {{a hallmark of}} fibroblasts from lung fibrosis patients, and FAK has therefore been hypothesized {{to be a key}} mediator of this disease. This study was undertaken to characterize the contribution of FAK to the development of pulmonary fibrosis both in vivo and in vitro. Methods FAK expression and activity were analyzed in lung tissue samples from lung fibrosis patients by immunohistochemistry. Mice orally treated with the FAK inhibitor PF- 562, 271, or with small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing of FAK were exposed to intratracheally instilled bleomycin to induce lung fibrosis, and lungs were harvested for histologic and biochemical analysis. Using endothelin 1 (ET- 1) as a stimulus, cell adhesion and contraction, as well as profibrotic gene expression, were studied in fibroblasts isolated from wild-type and FAK-deficient mouse embryos. ET- 1 -mediated FAK activation and gene expression were studied in primary mouse lung fibroblasts, as well as in wild-type and β 1 integrin-deficient mouse fibroblasts. Results FAK expression and activity were up-regulated in fibroblast foci and remodeled vessels from lung fibrosis patients. Pharmacologic or siRNA-mediated targeting of FAK resulted in marked abrogation of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. Loss of FAK impaired the acquisition of a profibrotic phenotype in response to ET- 1. Profibrotic gene expression leading to myofibroblast differentiation required cell adhesion, and was driven by JNK activation through β 1 integrin/FAK signaling. Conclusion These results implicate FAK as a central mediator of fibrogenesis, and highlight this kinase as a potential therapeutic target in fibrotic diseases.

40|$|Abstract: Multiple {{observations}} {{point to}} involvement of lipid membrane domains, known as lipid rafts, in the pathology of human disorders. The putative role of lipid rafts in hereditary and acquired skin blistering diseases {{is discussed in}} this review. Stable adhesion of the epidermis to the underlying basement membrane is secured by hemidesmosomes, specialized multiprotein complexes in basal keratinocytes. Loss of function of hemidesmosomal proteins due to inherited or acquired abnormalities result in weak dermal-epidermal adhesion and blistering of the skin. Lipid rafts regulate biological functions of two hemidesmosomal transmembrane components: collagen XVII and 64 integrin. Ectodomain shedding of collagen XVII is regulated by membrane lipid domains, suggesting involvement of lipid rafts in the pathogenesis of junctional epidermolysis bullosa, a genetic disease caused by mutations in the collagen XVII gene, and of bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune disease with autoantibodies to this collagen. Similarly, <b>adhesive</b> and <b>signaling</b> functions of 64 integrin are modulated by lipid rafts, again linking lipid rafts to junctional epidermolysis bullosa. Therefore, modulation of lipid domains in the epidermis might have therapeutic potential for this group of skin blistering diseases...|$|R
40|$|Vascular endothelial {{and smooth}} muscle cells exhibit {{reciprocal}} migratory responses after transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta 1 treatment. Endothelial cells exhibit a decreased migratory rate and smooth muscle cells exhibit an increased migratory rate. Previous {{studies have demonstrated}} increases in extracellular matrix and integrin synthesis and expression in response to TGF-beta 1. In this report, we illustrate the roles of plasminogen activator inhibitor in modulating the migratory rates in these two cell types. Endothelial cells appear to require a proteolytic phenotype for rapid migration, whereas vascular smooth muscle cells appear to require an anti-proteolytic phenotype. Modulation of proteinase/anti-proteinase activity ratios was accomplished via TGF-beta 1 induction, addition of exogenous plasminogen activator inhibitor, addition of anti-catalytic antibodies directed against urokinase plasminogen activator, overexpression of plasminogen activator inhibitor utilizing stable transfectants, {{and the use of}} vitronectin as a substratum. The reciprocal migratory behaviors exhibited by these two vascular cell types in response to TGF-beta 1 is discussed in the context that these two vascular cell types utilize distinct <b>adhesive</b> and <b>signaling</b> pathways in their interactions with extracellular matrix components and responsiveness to proteolytic activity...|$|R
40|$|The <b>adhesive</b> and <b>signaling</b> {{functions}} of integrins are regulated through their cytoplasmic domains. We identified a novel 111 residue polypeptide, designated beta 3 -endonexin, that interacted with the cytoplasmic {{tail of the}} beta 3 integrin subunit in a yeast two-hybrid system. This interaction is structurally specific, since it was reduced by 64 % by a point mutation in the beta 3 cytoplasmic tail (S 752 [...] >P) that disrupts integrin signaling. Moreover, this interaction is integrin subunit specific since it was not observed with the cytoplasmic tails of the alpha IIb, beta 1, or beta 2 subunits. beta 3 - Endonexin fusion proteins bound selectively to detergent-solubilized beta 3 from platelets and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and beta 3 -endonexin mRNA and protein were detected in platelets and other tissues. A related mRNA encoded a larger polypeptide that failed to bind to beta integrin tails. The apparent specificity of beta 3 - endonexin for the beta 3 integrin subunit suggests potential mechanisms for selective modulation of integrin functions...|$|R
40|$|Selectins {{and their}} ligands mediate {{leukocyte}} rolling allowing interactions with chemokines {{that lead to}} integrin activation and arrest. Here, we demonstrate that E-selectin is critical to induce a secondary wave of activating signals transduced specifically by E-selectin ligand- 1, that induces polarized, activated αMβ 2 integrin clusters {{at the leading edge}} of crawling neutrophils, allowing the capture of circulating erythrocytes or platelets. In a humanized model of sickle cell disease (SCD), the capture of erythrocytes by αMβ 2 microdomains leads to acute lethal vascular occlusions. In a model of transfusion-related acute lung injury, polarized neutrophils capture circulating platelets, resulting in the generation of oxidative species that produces vascular damage and lung injury. Inactivation of E-selectin or αMβ 2 prevented tissue injury in both inflammatory models, suggesting broad implications of this paradigm in thrombo-inflammatory diseases. These results indicate that endothelial selectins can influence neutrophil behavior beyond its canonical rolling step through delayed, organ-damaging, polarized activation. Leukocytes are recruited to inflamed areas by a tightly regulated cascade of <b>adhesive</b> and <b>signaling</b> events that choreograph their migration. Neutrophil (PMN) rolling is mediated b...|$|R
