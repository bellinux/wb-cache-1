500|$|Lyrically [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] {{describes}} {{a day in}} the life of Madonna, with the singer working through her schedule. The verses during the chorus are representative of how Madonna had previously ignored her detractors, instead choosing to express it with her music with the lines, [...] "I'm moving fast, Can you follow my track, I'm livin' fast, And I like it like that, I do ten things all at once, <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> problem, I don't give a." [...] During the bridge, the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not work out for unknown reasons, [...] "I tried to be a good girl/ I tried to be your wife/ I diminished myself/ And I swallowed my light." [...] Many critics agreed that the song has pretty direct lyrics that seem to take aim at her ex-husband, film director Guy Ritchie. However, when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song, Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg added that [...] " [...] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... I appreciate that people will speculate." [...] The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line, [...] "There's only one queen and that's Madonna. Bitch!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Solicitor General Paul D. Clement {{told the}} Court that he {{believed}} {{that even if the}} program had been set up by Congress instead of by an Executive Order there would still not be any standing for a taxpayer to sue, [...] "Because there has to be two things. There has to be a statute. And then {{there has to be an}} allegation that the statute creates a unique injury in the context of spending that affects taxpayers differently than anybodythan any other citizen. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> situation...where you don't have any spending that goes outside of the Government, then you might have an establishment clause problem, but it wouldn't be an establishment clause problem where the nub of the problem is the fact that money is spent." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2007, {{during a}} news conference in Staten Island, Bloomberg {{declared}} his strong opposition to legislation proposed in Congress calling for a clear timetable for troop withdrawal. He said, [...] "We ask our young men and women to go over and to fight, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> deadline knowing they're pulling out, how can you expect them to defend this country? How can you expect them to go out and put their lives at risk? I just think that's untenable and {{that this is not a}} responsible piece of legislation. It is totally separate of how we're conducting the war. It's totally separate of whether we should have been there. The issue that you asked about is plain and simple: Should the Congress pass a law forcing the president to withdraw troops at a given point in time? I think that is not something that is in the country's interest or in the military's interest." ...|$|E

[...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> allowed anything wrong {{to come to}} that security of Lignum's, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> let him in for it, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> put us {{in danger of being}} sold up--and I see sold up in your face, George, as plain as print--you have done a shameful action and have deceived us cruelly.

6000|$|... 'You'll {{never get}} it in houses and {{furniture}}--or even clothes. Houses and furniture and clothes, they are all terms of an old base world, a detestable society of man. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> Tudor house and old, beautiful furniture, {{it is only the}} past perpetuated on top of you, horrible. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> perfect modern house done for you by Poiret, it is something else perpetuated on top of you. It is all horrible. It is all possessions, possessions, bullying you and turning you into a generalisation. You have to be like Rodin, Michelangelo, and leave a piece of raw rock unfinished to your figure. You must leave your surroundings sketchy, unfinished, so that you are never contained, never confined, never dominated from the outside.' ...|$|E

'I don't know her, indeed, but I was in Loughrea yesterday, and a {{neighbour}} of hers {{that had}} some dealings with me {{was saying that}} she bade him send you word, if he met any one from this side in the market, that her mother has died from her, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> mind yet to join with herself, she is willing to keep her word to you.' ...|$|E

"I {{will read}} {{a chapter in}} the Bible myself," [...] he said; [...] "for I should not like the people {{to see one of}} the crew go overboard, and the {{officers}} have no word to say in the ceremonies; it might beget disrespect, and throw a slur on our knowledge; but you man-of-war's-men are generally more regularly brought up to prayers than us liners, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> proper book by you, I should feel infinitely obliged if you would give us a lift on this melancholy occasion." ...|$|E

6000|$|At {{eleven o'clock}} Captain Fagan arrived, on horseback, with a mounted dragoon after him. He paid his {{compliments}} to the collation which my mother's care had provided for him, and then said, 'Look ye, Redmond my boy; {{this is a}} silly business. The girl will marry Quin, mark my words; and as sure as she does you'll forget her. You are but a boy. Quin is willing to consider you as such.

6000|$|... 'Nay, {{have no fear}} of that. But for {{the rest}} I cannot say. In an hour you may be dead or great among us, if {{any of us can}} be called great in these days of shame. Otomie has worked well for you among the princes and the counsellors, so she says, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> heart, you should be {{grateful}} to her, for {{it seems to me that}} few women have loved a man so much. As for me, I have been employed elsewhere,' and he glanced at his rent armour, 'but I will lift up my voice for you. Now come, friend, for the torch burns low. By this time you must be well seasoned in dangers; one more or less will matter as little to you as to me.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{dare say}} the long {{residence}} of the Countess Czerlaski at Shepperton Vicarage is very puzzling to you also, dear reader, {{as well as to}} Mr. Barton's clerical brethren; the more so, as I hope you are not in the least inclined to put that very evil interpretation on it which evidently found acceptance with the sallow and dyspeptic Mr. Duke, and with the florid and highly peptic Mr. Fellowes. You have seen enough, I trust, of the Rev. Amos Barton, to be convinced that he was more apt to fall into a blunder than into a sin--more apt to be deceived than to incur a necessity for being deceitful: <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> keen eye for physiognomy, you will have detected that the Countess Czerlaski loved herself far too well to get entangled in an unprofitable vice.|$|E
