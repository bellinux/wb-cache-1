5|$|Plymouth's {{climate is}} a {{transitional}} humid continental/cold humid subtropical/marine type, {{which is the}} predominant climate for Massachusetts. Due to its location on the Atlantic Ocean, humidity levels can be very high year-round. Plymouth's coastal location causes it to experience warmer temperatures than many inland locations in New England. Summers are typically hot and humid, while winters <b>are</b> <b>cold,</b> windy and often snowy.|$|E

In the Calchaquí Valleys in Salta Province, the climate is temperate and arid with large thermal amplitudes, long summers, and a long frost free period which varies by altitude. In both the Quebrada de Humahuaca and Calchaquí valleys, winters <b>are</b> <b>cold</b> with frosts that can occur between March and September.|$|E

5|$|Winters <b>are</b> <b>cold</b> and snowy; Utica {{receives}} lake-effect {{snow from}} Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Utica is colder on average than other Great Lakes cities {{because of its}} location in a valley and susceptibility to north winds; temperatures in the single digits or below zero Fahrenheit are not uncommon on winter nights. Annual precipitation (based on a 30-year average from 1981–2010) is , falling on an average of 171 days.|$|E
5|$|An oceanic (or maritime) {{climate is}} {{typically}} found {{along the west}} coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents, bordering cool oceans, as well as southeastern Australia, and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round. The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of western North America, parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile. The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. A steppe is a dry grassland. Subarctic climates <b>are</b> <b>cold</b> with continuous permafrost and little precipitation.|$|E
5|$|Kona lows, most extra{{tropical}} cyclones, {{and tropical}} upper tropospheric cyclones <b>are</b> <b>cold</b> core lows. In {{the eastern half}} of the north Pacific ocean and north Indian ocean, the formation of a weak circulation underneath a mid to upper-tropospheric low which has cut off from the main belt of the westerlies during the cold season (winter) is called a subtropical cyclone. In the case of the north Indian ocean, the formation of this type of vortex leads to the onset of monsoon rains during the wet season.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{ambulances}} {{are typically}} powered by internal combustion engines, {{which can be}} powered by any conventional fuel, including diesel, gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas, depending on the preference of the operator {{and the availability of}} different options. Colder regions often use gasoline-powered engines, as diesels can be difficult to start when they <b>are</b> <b>cold.</b> Warmer regions may favor diesel engines, as they are thought to be more efficient and more durable. Diesel power is sometimes chosen due to safety concerns, after a series of fires involving gasoline-powered ambulances during the 1980s. These fires were ultimately attributed in part to gasoline's higher volatility in comparison to diesel fuel. The type of engine may be determined by the manufacturer: in the past two decades, Ford would only sell vehicles for ambulance conversion if they are diesel-powered. Beginning in 2010, Ford will sell its ambulance chassis with a gasoline engine in order to meet emissions requirements.|$|E
5|$|Reported {{details about}} the event, such as water boiling in the muddy crater for ten minutes from {{the heat of the}} impact, {{presented}} a problem for experts. Because the impact site is at a high altitude of more than , the meteoroid may not have been slowed down as much as it ordinarily would have been by passage through the Earth’s denser lower atmosphere, and kinetic energy at impact may have been unusually high for a terrestrial impact of an object of this size and mass. Most larger meteorites <b>are</b> <b>cold</b> in their bulk mass when they land on Earth, since their heated outer layers ablate from the objects before impacting. It was later confirmed that the meteorite contained a large amount of iron and possessed magnetic properties common to similar metallic objects, which contributed to its capacity to retain heat during atmospheric entry.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} may {{be manufactured}} from steel plate discs, which <b>are</b> <b>cold</b> {{drawn to a}} cylindrical cup form, {{in two or three}} stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} usually require {{very warm}} water to depth, generally above 26.5°C (80°F) extending {{to a depth}} of 50meters (160ft). However, the waters off California <b>are</b> <b>cold</b> even in summer. They rarely rise above 24°C (75°F) in near-shore southern California, and usually remain below 17°C (63°F) along {{most of the rest of}} the coast and outer coastal waters, although El Niño events may warm the waters somewhat. This is due primarily to the extensive upwelling of colder sub-surface waters caused by the prevailing northwesterly winds acting through the Ekman Effect. The winds drive surface water to the right of the wind flow, that is offshore, which draws water up from below to replace it. The upwelling further cools the already cool California Current which runs north to south along coastal California and even much of coastal Baja California. This is the same mechanism which produces coastal California's characteristic fog.|$|E
