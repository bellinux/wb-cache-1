25|$|The calling of {{a general}} strike had an {{unexpected}} result: it gave the General Strike Committee, whose makeup was far less militant than the longshoremen's strike committee, effective control over the maritime strike itself. When the Labor Council voted to terminate the general strike it also recommended that the unions <b>accept</b> <b>arbitration</b> of all disputed issues. When the National Longshore Board put the employer's proposal to arbitrate to a vote of striking longshoremen, it passed in every port except Everett, Washington.|$|E

The union membership voted overwhelmingly on 5 March to <b>accept</b> <b>arbitration.</b> The arbitration decision went against them, but the union voted on 9 March 1897 to return to work at the old wage scale.

25|$|Bell {{wanted a}} three-year {{contract}} from the Padres, who instead offered two years with an option for 2014.

The Padres offered arbitration, but Bell backed away from his earlier intention to <b>accept</b> <b>arbitration.</b> The Miami Marlins, the Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim were also interested in signing him. Bell had a 27–19 record with a 2.53earned run average and 134 saves in 354 appearances with the Padres over five seasons. His 132saves in the last three seasons led the majors.|$|E
500|$|Britain unofficially {{told the}} United States on 17 December {{that it would}} <b>accept</b> <b>arbitration</b> in principle, and that Germany would soon agree too, and it did on 19 December. Castro's failure to back down left limited options {{in the face of}} the Monroe Doctrine, which would make any seizure of Venezuelan territory, even temporarily, problematic. In addition, the {{negative}} reaction in the British and American press had raised the costs of the intervention particularly for Germany, whose relations with the US were more fragile than the United Kingdom's and who placed great value on the attitude of the British press. Germany had followed the United Kingdom's lead throughout the planning and execution of the operation, and as the British Ambassador in Berlin observed, [...] "The idea of arbitration did not smile on them, but they accepted it at once because we had proposed it". Fourteen years later (during a presidential campaign against the backdrop of World War I), then US President Theodore Roosevelt claimed that Germany's acquiescence to arbitration came from his threat to attack the German ships in Venezuelan waters using Dewey's fleet. No documentary evidence has been found to confirm the claim. However, following the 18 December announcement that the US Navy fleet would be dispersed to West Indian ports for Christmas, which would take some of it to Trinidad, near the Venezuelan coast, the German embassy in Washington sought clarification from the US government.|$|E

2500|$|Bell was {{the highest}} paid Padres player in 2011 at $7.5 million salary and would be {{eligible}} for free agency {{at the end of the}} season. He converted his first seven save opportunities of 2011, which tied him with Hoffman for the Padres club record of 41 consecutive successful save conversions. The streak also tied him with Hoffman and Rod Beck for the then-fourth longest in MLB history. Bell blew his next save opportunity, a 3–0 lead, after he opened the ninth inning walking the first two batters, and third baseman Chase Headley made a two-out, two-run throwing error to tie the game. On May 14, Bell recorded his 100th career save in a 9–7 win over the Colorado Rockies. Bell was selected to his third consecutive All-Star game. Entering the game in the eight inning, Bell sprinted from the bullpen and did a slide in front of the pitcher's mound, taking out a chunk of the infield grass and leaving grass stains on his pants. [...] "I wanted the fans to have fun with this", said Bell. With the team 12 games under [...]500 coming out of the All-Star break, general manager Jed Hoyer said the Padres would pursue a long-term contract with Bell if they did not get a desirable trade offer for him. Ultimately Bell was not traded at the non-waiver trade deadline on July 31, but Hoyer admitted Bell's greatest value to the team might come as a free agent if Bell refuses salary arbitration and signs elsewhere—the Padres would receive two first-round draft picks in June 2012 as compensation. Bell said he planned to <b>accept</b> <b>arbitration</b> from the Padres if they did not agree on a multi-year deal. He finished the season 43 of 48 in save opportunities with a 2.44ERA, but he struck out less than 30percent of all opponents’ at-bats for the first time as a Padre.|$|E

500|$|A {{group of}} Ali's army, later known as Kharijites or Khawarij ("those who leave"), opposed against {{arbitration}} {{after the battle}} of Siffin, when he <b>accepted</b> <b>arbitration</b> with Mu'awiya. They opposed to human judgement {{in the matter of}} religion and used [...] "Judgment belongs to God alone," [...] as their slogan. In 658 they violated their oath of allegiance, revolted and openly threatened to kill any Muslim who would not join them. Ali defeated them at the Battle of Nahrawan. The killing of the Kharijites [...] was [...] "the most problematic event" [...] during Ali's caliphate, because they had been among his most vigorous allies in the war against Muawiah.|$|R
5|$|In January 1896 the British Government {{decided in}} effect to {{recognise}} the US right {{to intervene in}} the boundary dispute, <b>accepting</b> <b>arbitration</b> in principle without insisting on the Schomburgk line as a basis for negotiation.

An agreement between the US and UK was signed on 12 November 1896. Cleveland's Boundary Commission's work was suspended in November 1896, though it still went on to produce a large report.|$|R

2500|$|In {{terms of}} {{international}} law, the Vienna Award was later ruled to be null and void. Although it {{was presented as}} a voluntary act of two sovereign states in arbitration, the Czechoslovak government had <b>accepted</b> <b>arbitration</b> under a presumed threat from both arbiters (Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy) and under heavy influence of the [...] demands of Hungary. Under international law, the act is considered to have been illegal and its result could not be accepted as valid. Just as the Munich agreement was later nullified as Czechoslovakia's interests were largely ignored and the arbiters had used their military prowess to pressure those in the agreement, the Vienna Award was also found to be illegal {{at the end of}} World War II.

Ultimately Britain backed down and tacitly accepted the US right to intervene under the Monroe Doctrine.

50|$|In 1895, {{a longstanding}} dispute with Great Britain about the {{territory}} of Guayana Esequiba, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory, erupted into the Venezuela Crisis of 1895. The dispute became a diplomatic crisis when Venezuela's lobbyist William L. Scruggs sought to argue that British behavior over the issue violated the United States' Monroe Doctrine of 1823, and used his influence in Washington, D.C., to pursue the matter. Then, US President Grover Cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the doctrine that did not just simply forbid new European colonies, but declared an American interest in any matter within the hemisphere. Britain ultimately <b>accepted</b> <b>arbitration,</b> but in negotiations over its terms was able to persuade the US {{on many of the}} details. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the issue, and in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to British Guiana.|$|R
