Phillips joined a new band called Projected with Sevendust members John Connolly and Vinnie Hornsby, and former Submersed guitarist Eric Friedman, releasing an album called Human.|$|E

Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E

500|$|Units of the Soviet Air Defence Forces {{that had}} been {{tracking}} the South Korean aircraft {{for more than an}} hour while it entered and left Soviet airspace now classified the aircraft as a military target when it reentered their airspace over Sakhalin. After the protracted ground-controlled interception, the three Su-15 fighters (from nearby Dolinsk-Sokol airbase) and the MiG-23 (from Smirnykh Air Base) managed to make visual contact with the Boeing. The pilot of the lead Su-15 fighter fired warning shots, but recalled later in 1991, [...] "I fired four bursts, more than 200 rounds. For all the good it did.

500|$|Besides winning two of {{the most}} prestigious {{literary}} prizes in France (Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française and Prix Goncourt), Les Bienveillantes was generally very favourably reviewed in the French literary press. Le Figaro proclaimed Littell [...] "man of the year". The editor of the Nouvel Observateurs literary section called it [...] "a great book" [...] and the weekly Le Point stated that the novel has [...] "exploded onto the dreary plain of the literary autumn like a meteor." [...] Even though French filmmaker and professor Claude Lanzmann had mixed feelings about the book, he said: [...] "I am familiar with his subject, and above <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> astounded by the absolute accuracy of the novel. Everything is correct." [...] French historian Pierre Nora called it [...] "an extraordinary literary and historical phenomenon." [...] The book has been compared to War and Peace for its similar scope and ambition.|$|E

500|$|Patrick's {{voice is}} {{provided}} by actor Bill Fagerbakke, who also does the voices of numerous other characters on SpongeBob SquarePants. While creating the show and writing its pilot episode in 1997, Hillenburg and Derek Drymon, the show's then-creative director, were also conducting auditions to find voices for the show's characters. Fagerbakke auditioned {{for the role of}} Patrick after Tom Kenny, SpongeBob's voice actor, had been cast. Fagerbakke said, [...] "Steve is such a lovely guy, and I had absolutely no feeling for the material whatsoever." [...] He described his experience in the audition, saying [...] "I was just going in for another audition, and I {{had no idea what was}} in store there in terms of the remarkable visual wit and really the kind of endearing child-like humanity in the show.

500|$|Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack reached #4 on the Oricon charts, {{and sold}} 140,000 copies as of January 2010. The album was {{moderately}} well received; while some reviewers felt {{it to be}} an [...] "absolutely amazing" [...] soundtrack, others only found it to be a [...] "satisfying" [...] work that was [...] "not quite <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hoping for". Some reviewers felt that of the three composers, Uematsu's pieces were the weakest, citing them as having a tendency to be [...] "buried" [...] under the compositions of the others. The same reviewers, however, noted that some of the best pieces on the soundtrack, such as [...] "To Zanarkand", were the work of Uematsu. Hamauzu's contributions were seen as some of his best work, and reviewers felt that both he and Nakano brought a [...] "myriad of new flavors" [...] to the soundtrack which were very well received. Final Fantasy X Official Soundtrack, although not re-released after the Original Soundtrack was brought to North America, was seen as a good sampler of the music from the full soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Josh Modell of The A.V. Club {{said the}} episode was [...] "boring" [...] and [...] "unfunny", and was particularly disappointing following the episode [...] "Fishsticks" [...] the previous week. Modell said, [...] "South Park episodes don't get much lazier or uninspired than this one. It was like half an idea stretched out forever and ever, and {{with very little}} payoff." [...] Carlos Delgado of If Magazine said the episode plot was too silly and lacked laughs: [...] "All in <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> left feeling a little cheated. [...] "Pinewood Derby" [...] wasn’t funny, it was just weird." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said the episode was told with [...] "the warp-speed storytelling style that is making this season one of South Parks best". Travis Fickett of IGN said {{he was happy to}} see an episode centered on Randy Marsh, who he said is an excellent character; Fickett said of [...] "Pinewood Derby", [...] "This isn't a great episode but its fast-paced lunacy in the South Park tradition and most of the genre tropes it riffs on are dead on." ...|$|E

500|$|Bill Fagerbakke voiced SpongeBob's best friend, a starfish named Patrick Star in the episode. He {{auditioned for}} the role after Kenny had been cast as SpongeBob.

[...] For the part of Squidward, Hillenburg originally had Mr. Lawrence in mind {{for the role}}. Lawrence worked with Hillenburg and Drymon before on Rocko's Modern Life, so while working on the episode, Hillenburg invited him to audition for all the characters. Drymon said, [...] "We were showing Doug the storyboard, and he started reading back to us in his Tony the Tiger/Gregory Peck voice. It was really funny, and we wound up having SpongeBob use a deep voice when he entered the Krusty Krab for the first time." [...] Hillenburg decided to give Lawrence the part of the series villain, Plankton, instead.|$|E
500|$|Spurs won the 1949–50 Second Division {{title with}} seven games to spare, scoring more goals and conceding fewer {{than any of}} their rivals, and were {{promoted}} to the First Division for the following season. In August 1950, shortly before Tottenham embarked on their first top-flight season since they had been relegated {{at the end of}} the 1934–35 campaign, Rowe told the club's annual meeting: [...] "As much as anything else, I would rate our good time last year to the acquisition of Alf Ramsey." [...] After an uncertain start to the 1950–51 season, Spurs quickly recovered their form of the previous year and by Christmas were top of the table. Ramsey continued to play a key role, according to McKinstry playing [...] "the best football of his life": [...] "He was the master of strategy, the lynchpin of a side that built its attacks from the back, the scheming practitioner who put Rowe's plans into action." [...] His understanding of the game and authority on and off the field led to his teammates nicknaming him [...] "The General". On 28 April 1951, with a 1–0 home victory over Sheffield Wednesday, Tottenham were crowned champions of England only a year after promotion. [...] "I think fortune shone upon me very handsomely during the 1950–51 season," [...] Ramsey remarked in Talking Football—"After <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a member of one of the finest club teams in years".|$|E
500|$|The Southern Rhodesian {{electoral system}} allowed {{only those who}} met certain {{financial}} and educational qualifications to vote. The criteria were applied equally to all regardless of race, but since most Black citizens {{did not meet the}} set standards, the electoral roll and the colonial parliament were overwhelmingly White. Smith canvassed around the geographically very large Selukwe constituency and quickly won considerable popularity. Many White families were receptive to him because of their respect for his father, or because they had had children at school with him. His RAF service also helped, particularly as the local United Party candidate, Petrus Cilliers, had been interned during the hostilities for opposing the war effort. On 15 September 1948, Smith defeated Cilliers and the Labour candidate Egon Klifborg with 361 votes out of 747, and thereby became Member of Parliament for Selukwe. At 29 years old, he was the youngest MP in Southern Rhodesian history. The Liberals, however, were roundly defeated, going from 12 seats before the election to only five afterwards. Smit, who had lost his seat in Salisbury City, retired and was replaced as Leader of the Opposition by Raymond Stockil, who renamed the Liberals the Rhodesia Party. Having grown up in an area of Cape Town so pro-Smuts that she had never had to vote, Janet did not think her husband's entry to parliament would alter their lives at all. [...] "First of <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> marrying a farmer," [...] she later said, [...] "now {{he was going to be}} a politician as well. So I said, 'Well, if you are really interested in it, carry on.'...It never dawned on me—being so naive about politicians—that our lives would be affected in the slightest degree." ...|$|E
