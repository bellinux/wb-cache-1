5|$|Abelisaurids, {{especially}} Majungasaurus, may instead {{have been}} adapted for a feeding strategy {{more similar to}} modern felids, with short and broad snouts, that bite once and hold on until the prey is subdued. Majungasaurus had an even broader snout than other abelisaurids, {{and other aspects of}} its anatomy may also support the bite-and-hold hypothesis. The neck was strengthened, with robust vertebrae, interlocking ribs and ossified tendons, as well as reinforced muscle attachment sites on the vertebrae and the back of the skull. These muscles {{would have been able to}} hold the head steady despite the struggles of its prey. Abelisaurid skulls were also strengthened in many areas by bone mineralized out of the skin, creating the characteristic rough texture of the bones. This is particularly true of Majungasaurus, where the nasal bones were fused and thickened for strength. On the other hand, the lower jaw of Majungasaurus sported a large fenestra (opening) on each side, as seen in other ceratosaurs, as well as synovial joints between certain bones that allowed a high degree of flexibility in the lower jaw, although not to the extent seen in snakes. This may have been an adaptation to prevent the fracture of the lower jaw when holding onto a struggling prey animal. The front teeth of the upper jaw were more robust than the rest, to provide an <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> for the bite, while the low crown height of Majungasaurus teeth prevented them from breaking off during a struggle. Finally, unlike the teeth of Allosaurus and most other theropods, which were curved on both the front and back, abelisaurids like Majungasaurus had teeth curved on the front edge but straighter on the back (cutting) edge. This structure may have served to prevent slicing, and instead holding the teeth in place when biting.|$|E
25|$|We take an illustrative {{synthetic}} bivariate {{data set}} of 50 points {{to illustrate the}} construction of histograms. This requires the choice of an <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> (the lower left corner of the histogram grid). For the histogram on the left, we choose (−1.5,−1.5): for {{the one on the}} right, we shift the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> by 0.125 in both directions to (−1.625,−1.625). Both histograms have a binwidth of 0.5, so any differences are due to the change in the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> only. The colour-coding indicates the number of data points which fall into a bin: 0=white, 1=pale yellow, 2=bright yellow, 3=orange, 4=red. The left histogram appears to indicate that the upper half has a higher density than the lower half, whereas the reverse is the case for the right-hand histogram, confirming that histograms are highly sensitive to the placement of the <b>anchor</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

These <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> {{can be used}} to estimate the pose and then match the test image to a 3 D face model.

We achieve 99 % success in finding <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> in frontal images and 86 % success in scans with large variations in pose and changes in expression.

Most methods for genomic alignment use high-scoring local alignments as <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> to reduce the search space of the alignment procedure.

40|$|A {{common goal}} of outdoor {{augmented}} reality (AR) is {{the presentation of}} annotations that are registered to <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> in the real world. We present an enhanced approach for registering and tracking such <b>anchor</b> <b>points,</b> which is suitable for current generation mobile phones and can also successfully deal with {{the wide variety of}} viewing conditions encountered in real life outdoor use. The approach is based on on-the-fly generation of panoramic images by sweeping the camera over the scene. The panoramas are then used for stable orientation tracking, while the user is performing only rotational movements. This basic approach is improved by several new techniques for the re-detection and tracking of <b>anchor</b> <b>points.</b> For the re-detection, specifically after temporal variations, we first compute a panoramic image with extended dynamic range, which can better represent varying illumination conditions. The panorama is then searched for known <b>anchor</b> <b>points,</b> while orientation tracking continues uninterrupted. We then use information from an internal orientation sensor to prime an active search scheme for the <b>anchor</b> <b>points,</b> which improves matching results. Finally, global consistency is enhanced by statistical estimation of a global rotation that minimizes the overall position error of <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> when transforming them from the source panorama in which they were created, to the current view represented by a new panorama. Once the <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> are redetected, we track the user's movement using a novel 3 -degree-of-freedom orientation tracking approach that combines vision tracking with the absolute orientation from inertial and magnetic sensors. We tested our system using an AR campus guide as an example application and provide detailed results for our approach using an off-the-shelf smartphone. Results show that the re-detection rate is improved by a factor of 2 compared to previous work and reaches almost 90 % {{for a wide variety of}} test cases while still keeping the ability to run at interactive frame rates...|$|R

25|$|One {{approach}} for exhaustive enumeration goes as follows.

This ensures that the fragment chain forms realistic angles both within the fragment and between fragments. This is then repeated until a loop with the correct length of residues is constructed.|$|E

25|$|When push-points are absent, {{but there}} is not enough space to use sidewinding because of lateral constraints, such as in tunnels, snakes rely on {{concertina}} locomotion. In this mode, the snake braces the posterior portion of its body against the tunnel wall while the front of the snake extends and straightens. The front portion then flexes and forms an <b>anchor</b> <b>point,</b> and the posterior is straightened and pulled forwards. This mode of locomotion is slow and very demanding, up to seven times the cost of laterally undulating over the same distance. This high cost is due to the repeated stops and starts of portions of the body as well as the necessity of using active muscular effort to brace against the tunnel walls.|$|E
25|$|A {{inverter}} or capsizing {{line can}} {{be attached to the}} top of the bag. This line should be long enough and strong enough to attach to an independent <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> so that if the lift bag or rigging fails the bag will be inverted and the air will escape, preventing a runaway lift. This procedure is generally used for short distance transport near the bottom, as when aligning large components for assembly. With this method the load will generally hold the bag in the upright position, so the tripping line may be subjected to considerable load and the bag may not invert. An inverter line can also be attached to the load, so it will capsize the bag if it breaks free of the load, but this will not stop a runaway lift, and a holdback line is used for this purpose.|$|E
