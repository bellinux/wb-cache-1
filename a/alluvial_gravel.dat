25|$|The depth, {{texture and}} {{composition}} of soils can influence its water retaining and draining ability. Soils containing large amounts of organic material tend to have the highest water retention abilities. These types of soils include deep loams, silty soils like what is typically found on the fertile valley floors {{such as in the}} California's Napa Valley. Clay particles have the potential to remain in colloidal suspension {{for long periods of time}} when it is dissolved in water. This gives clay-based soils the potential to retain significant amount of water such as the clay soils of the Right bank Bordeaux region of Pomerol. Many regions with these types of water retaining soils have little need for irrigation, or if they do it is usually supplemental during periods of drought. Soils with poor water retention include sand and <b>alluvial</b> <b>gravel</b> based soils such as those found in the Barolo and Barbaresco zones of Italy or in many areas of South Australia. Depending on the climate and amount of natural rainfall, areas with poor water retention may need irrigation.|$|E

40|$|Fault slip-rates and the {{recurrence}} interval between earthquakes {{can be determined}} from reliable dating of deformed sediments. We report optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages of <b>alluvial</b> <b>gravels,</b> fine-grained sediments and colluvial deposits associated with the Sabzevar thrust fault in northeastern Iran. Six samples of the late Quaternary deposits were dated by OSL using the single aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) protocol. The OSL ages indicate deposition of <b>alluvial</b> <b>gravels</b> in the study region between ∼ 30 and ∼ 9 - 13  ka, followed by a period of fluvial incision which is ongoing at the present day. The alluvial deposits have been uplifted by ∼ 9. 5  m relative to the river level, indicating a Holocene slip-rate of ∼ 1  mm/yr and a rate of convergence across the fault of 0. 4 - 0. 6  mm/yr assuming a maximum fault dip of 60 °. The average interval between large earthquakes on the Sabzevar fault will be ∼ 3000  years if the fault dips ∼ 60 °, and less if the fault dip is less.

50|$|The {{civil parish}} covers 2,696 acres (1,091 hectares), and has long east-west and short north-south axes, {{stretching}} from the downs west of the River Avon to the watershed of the Avon and Till rivers in the east. Most of it is chalk downland, {{but there is some}} <b>alluvial</b> <b>gravel</b> deposited around the river. The village was formerly in two parts based around two manors: East End and West End. The East End was in the vicinity of Bulford Road, while the West End was based at the High Street. These streets are aligned north and south and the church is set between them, in the north of the village. The East/West dichotomy was brought to an end with the construction of a large council estate centred on Coronation Road during the 1950s between the East and West Ends. Therefore, {{it would be better to}} say that the village is, nowadays, divided into a North End and South End: the North contains the old, pre-20th-century village, with expensive, mainly thatched houses, whereas the South contains the council houses (many of which are now privately owned).|$|E
50|$|Canterbury Bight is a 135 km {{stretch of}} {{coastline}} between Dashing Rocks (north Timaru) {{and the southern}} side of Banks Peninsula (Birdlings Flat) {{on the eastern side}} of the South Island, New Zealand. The bight faces southeast, which exposes it to high-energy storm waves originating in the Pacific Ocean (Kirk, 1967). The most frequent wave approach direction for the Canterbury Bight is from the southeast and the most dominant the south with wave heights of over 2m common (Kirk, 1967). The bight is a large, gently curving bend of shoreline of primarily mixed sand and gravel (MSG) beaches. The MSG beaches are steep, highly reflective (of wave energy) and composed of <b>alluvial</b> <b>gravel</b> deposits. The alluvial gravels are the outwash products of multiple glaciations that occurred in the Southern Alps during the Pleistocene (Kirk, 1967). Large braided rivers transported this material to the edge of the current continental shelf, which, due to sea level rise is 50 km seaward of the coasts current position (Kirk, 1967). The MSG beaches of the Canterbury Bight therefore occur where the alluvial fans of the Canterbury Plains rivers are exposed to high-energy ocean swells (Hart et al., 2008). The dominant rock ‘greywacke’ in the Southern Alps is consequently the primary constituent of the MSG beaches (and Canterbury Plains), which is partially indurated sandstone of the Torlesse Supergroup (Hart et al., 2008). River-mouth lagoons are a relatively common occurrence on the MSG beaches of the Canterbury Bight.|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews New Zealand {{research}} and experience with fertilisers at establishment of plantations of exotic tree species and outlines current manage-ment practice. The first commercial use of fertilisers at establishment {{was made in}} the mid- 1960 s during planting of radiata pine on P-deficient clay soils. Currently c. 6000 ha of new plantings are fertilised annually. The main fertiliser elements are P, N and B. All are applied manually on an individual basis in order to minimise stimulation of competing vegetation. The most common practice is to place the fertiliser in a spade slit some 15 cm {{from the base of the}} seedling within 3 to 8 weeks after planting. Phosphorus is applied to radiata pine at establishment mainly on weathered and leached clays and podsolised sands in the Auckland region and on strongly leached <b>alluvial</b> <b>gravels</b> in the Nelson region. With minor variations application rates are (as P) 17 g/seedling in the Auckland region and 6 - 10 g/seedling in the Nelson region. Most P is applied as superphosphate (8 - 10 % P). Responses to P tend to be enhanced by site preparation methods involving weed control and deep soil cultivation. Spot applications of P at establishment are usually effective for only 3 to 4 years. Nitrogen is applied at establishment of radiata pine on podsolised soils, skid sites where topsoil has been removed and on strongly leached <b>alluvial</b> <b>gravels.</b> The most common application rate is c. 15 g/seedling of N applied as urea, or diammonium phosphate where both N and P are required. Nitrogen is used in the establishment of Eucalyptus spp. on a range of sites with up to 30 g/seedling of N (as urea) being used. Establishment applications of N tend to be effective for only 1 to 2 years. Boron is used to a limited extent in the establishment of radiata pine on strongly leached soils formed from <b>alluvial</b> <b>gravels</b> and granite in the Nelson region. It is usually applied in the form of boronated superphosphate to give 0. 8 g/seedling of B. These applications are usually effective for only 3 to 4 years...|$|R

50|$|The {{government}} also {{is trying to}} expand Ghana's diamond-mining industry, which has produced primarily industrial grade gems from <b>alluvial</b> <b>gravels</b> since the 1920s. More than 11000000 carat kg of proven and probable reserves are located about seventy miles northwest of Accra. The main producer is the state-owned Ghana Consolidated Diamonds (GCD), which operates in the Birim River Basin. In the 1960s, the company mined 2000000 carat kg of diamonds a year, but annual production in 1991 amounted to only 146000 carat kg. This downturn resulted from technical problems and GCD's weak financial position. Production from all mines came to 688000 carat kg in 1991 and to 694000 carat kg in 1992.|$|R

The timing of the faulting is interpreted to be Late Quaternary (Fenton et al., 2003). The relationship between this fault and the Thoen Fault remains unknown, although its location and orientation suggest that it is a synthetic fault (i.e., it has the same dip and sense of movement as the main fault) (Fenton et al., 2003).|$|R
40|$|Variations in {{floodplain}} channel {{water levels}} and valley floor groundwater levels (measured in piezometers and boreholes) are examined at selected {{points along the}} course of the River Lambourn, a chalk river in southern England. A local <b>alluvial</b> <b>gravel</b> aquifer in the valley bottom is associated with numerous small wetlands that extend over much of the river's perennial profile. Variations in hydraulic gradient between local borehole levels and/or floodplain channel water levels are described for three sites in the seasonal section of the channel at Bockhampton, East Garston and West Shefford. The results indicate that observed groundwater levels are closely associated with flows from discrete springs at the margins of the channel and floodplain. However, as the floodplain widens and the <b>alluvial</b> <b>gravel</b> aquifer increases in size, the gravel aquifer accounts for a substantial down-valley component of groundwater flow with a diffuse vertical water flux. In the lower catchment, the exchange of flows between the gravel aquifer and the river enables some attenuation of floodplain water-table variability, providing a stable hydrological regime for valley-bottom wetlands. Catchment controls upon the local, valley-bottom, wetland regime are demonstrated with the application of a simple groundwater model developed using MODFLOW. The model is used to simulate groundwater discharge to the river in the upper and lower catchment, in addition to the water level regime at selected points in the valley bottom in the lower catchment. The results demonstrate the importance of taking catchment-scale water flow into account when managing isolated wetlands in a permeable catchment...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a sequence of}} stratified quartzite slope deposits and <b>alluvial</b> fan <b>gravels</b> from a small catchment at Rocky Cape. A lower series of indurated slope deposits overlain by a podzol soil profile suggests that cold climatic conditions, which favoured frost fracturing of exposed 13 rock surfaces and gelifluction of detritus, occurred prior to the Last Glacial Stage. An upper series of unconsolidated slope deposits contains wedge structures. These deposits appear to have resulted from frost fracturing and to have been moved downslope by gelifluction processes. The wedge structures may have been produced by seasonal freezing of the ground surface {{during the period of}} maximum cold in the Last Glacial Stage (after 22, 000 and before 10, 000 BP). Radiocarbon dating of charcoal and wood from organic horizons and a buried soil in the lower part of a thick sequence of <b>alluvial</b> fan <b>gravels</b> shows that they began to accumulate mainly between about 33, 000 and 22, 000 BP, when strong but episodic erosion of the open Eucalyptus forested catchment occurred. The upper part of the <b>alluvial</b> fan <b>gravels</b> does not contain organic horizons but probably accumulated after 22, 000 and before 10, 000 BP.
