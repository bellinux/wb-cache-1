5|$|Plants {{appear in}} art, either to {{illustrate}} their botanical appearance, {{or for the}} purposes of the artist, which may include decoration or religious symbolism. For example, the Virgin Mary was compared by the Venerable Bede to a lily, the white petals denoting purity of body, while the yellow anthers signified the radiant light of the soul; accordingly, European portraits of the Virgin's Annunciation may depict <b>a</b> <b>vase</b> <b>of</b> white lilies in her room to indicate her attributes. Plants are also often used as backgrounds or features in portraits, and as main subjects in still lifes.|$|E

25|$|La Femme aux Phlox is an oil {{on canvas}} with {{dimensions}} 81 x 100cm (31 by 39 inches) signed and dated 'Alb Gleizes 10'. Created {{during the second half}} of 1910, the painting represents a woman sitting in an interior setting, with <b>a</b> <b>vase</b> <b>of</b> flowers (phloxes) in front and another to her left. The window behind the sitter opens out onto an exterior scene, the whole blurring the distinction between interior and exterior.|$|E
25|$|In 1937 Schiaparelli {{collaborated with}} the artist Jean Cocteau to produce two of her most notable art-themed designs for that year's Autumn collection. An evening jacket was {{embroidered}} with a female figure with one hand caressing the waist of the wearer, and long blonde hair cascading down one sleeve. A long evening coat featured two profiles facing each other, creating the optical illusion of <b>a</b> <b>vase</b> <b>of</b> roses. The embroidering of both garments was executed by the couture embroiderers Lesage.|$|E
25|$|At an {{undetermined}} date, a great clearance {{of temple}} offerings {{had been made}} and a modern discovery of a chamber into which they were gathered yielded the fine ivory carvings and the glazed figures and tiles that show the splendid work of the first dynasty. <b>A</b> <b>vase</b> <b>of</b> Menes with purple hieroglyphs inlaid into a green glaze and tiles with relief figures {{are the most important}} pieces found. The noble statuette of Cheops in ivory, found in the stone chamber of the temple, gives the only portrait of this great pharaoh.|$|E

25|$|His son and {{successor}} Entemena {{restored the}} prestige of Lagash. Illi of Umma was subdued, {{with the help of}} his ally Lugal-kinishe-dudu or Lugal-ure of Uruk, successor to Enshakushana and also on the king-list. Lugal-kinishe-dudu seems to have been the prominent figure at the time, since he also claimed to rule Kish and Ur. A silver vase dedicated by Entemena to his god is now in the Louvre. A frieze of lions devouring ibexes and deer, incised with great artistic skill, runs round the neck, while the eagle crest of Lagash adorns the globular part. The vase is a proof of the high degree of excellence to which the goldsmith's art had already attained. <b>A</b> <b>vase</b> <b>of</b> calcite, also dedicated by Entemena, has been found at Nippur. After Entemena, a series of weak, corrupt priest-kings is attested for Lagash. The last of these, Urukagina, was known for his judicial, social, and economic reforms, and his may well be the first legal code known to have existed.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Campbell denounced Nazi Germany and returned to Britain. He did duty as an Air Raid Precautions warden in London. During this period he met and befriended Dylan Thomas, a fellow alcoholic, with whom he once ate <b>a</b> <b>vase</b> <b>of</b> daffodils in celebration of St. David's Day. Although he was over draft age and in bad physical shape, as well as having a bad hip, Campbell finally managed to get enlisted in the British Army. He was accepted by the Intelligence Corps because of his knowledge of languages and began training as a private with the Royal Welch Fusiliers on 1 April 1942. Having completed basic training, Campbell was transferred in July to the I.C. Depot near Winchester, where he was trained in motorcycles. In February 1943 he was promoted to sergeant, and in March he was posted to British East Africa. On 5 May, he arrived in Nairobi and was attached to the King's African Rifles, serving in a camp two miles outside the city. After having worked as a military censor he was transferred in June to the 12th Observation Unit of the commando force being trained for jungle warfare against the Japanese. However, any hope of seeing real action in the Far East was thwarted when Campbell during training in late July suffered a new injury to his damaged hip in a fall from a motorcycle. He was sent back to hospital in Nairobi, where the doctors examined an X-ray of his hips and declared him unfit for active duty.|$|E
25|$|The Pontic vases {{are also}} closely related stylistically to Ionian pottery painting. Also {{in this case}} it is assumed that they were {{produced}} in Etruscan workshops by craftsmen who emigrated from Ionia. The vases got their misleading name from the depiction on <b>a</b> <b>vase</b> <b>of</b> archers thought to be Scythians, who lived at the Black Sea (Pontus). Most of the vases were found in graves in Vulci, a significant number also in Cerveteri. The index form was a neck amphora with a particularly slender shape, closely resembling Tyrrhenian amphoras. Other shapes were oenochoes with spiral handles, dinos, kyathos, plates, beakers with high bases, and, less often, kantharos and other forms. The adornment of Pontic vases is always similar. In general there is an ornamental decoration on the neck, then figures on the shoulder, followed by another band of ornaments, an animal frieze, and finally a ring of rays. Foot, neck and handles are black. The importance of ornaments is noticeable, although they are often rather carelessly formed; some vases are decorated only with ornaments. The clay of these vases is yellowish-red; the slip covering the vases is black or brownish-red, of high quality, and with a metallic sheen. Red and white opaque colors are generously used for figures and ornaments. Animals are usually decorated with a white stripe on their bellies. Scholars have identified six workshops to date. The earliest and best is considered to be that of the Paris Painter. He shows mythological figures, included a beardless Heracles, as was customary in eastern Greece. Occasionally there are scenes which are not a part of Greek mythology, such as Heracles fighting Juno Sospita ("the Savior") by the Paris Painter, or a wolf demon by the Tityos Painter. There are also scenes of daily life, komos scenes, and riders. The vases are dated to a time between 550 and 500 BC, and about 200 are known.|$|E

500|$|To {{the north}} of the mansion was a garden, which was purportedly well known for its boxwoods, lilacs, and roses. The garden {{remained}} through the ownership of the Smoot family. A winding path led from the mansion to a large burial vault, which was closed by a great iron lock. According to members of the Smoot family, the lock to the burial vault would [...] "never stay locked more than three days" [...] at a time. <b>A</b> <b>vase</b> <b>of</b> urn stood in the front lawn of the mansion; according to tradition this marked the location where Pocahontas was baptized.

500|$|In addition, several {{alabaster}} vases bearing Unas' cartouche are known.

Another vessel, of unknown origins, is on display at the Louvre Museum. It is a , [...] globular alabaster vase finely decorated with a falcon with outstretched wings and two uraei, or rearing cobras, holding ankh signs surrounding Unas' cartouche. An ointment jar bearing Unas' cartouche and Horus name is in the Brooklyn Museum. Finally, a fragment of a calcite vase rim bearing two cartouches of Unas is on display in the Petrie Museum.|$|E

[...] (Original letter is in the Eagle Crest Library.) Further, the Harpers Literary Gossip printed an article, [...] "How the First 'Ben-Hur' Was Bound": [...] "Inquiries have reached the Harpers concerning the binding of the first edition of Ben-Hur, which appeared in 1880. The first edition was issued in a series which the Harpers were then publishing. It was 16mo form, bound in cadet-blue cloth, and decorated with clusters of flowers in red, blue, and green on the front cover and <b>a</b> <b>vase</b> <b>of</b> flowers in the same colors on the back cover.

2500|$|By {{the early}} seventeenth century {{drinking}} chocolate {{began to be}} popular in Spain, and was first accepted by the upper classes. It gradually expanded in two directions: geographic and social. Other foods from The Americas were not so accepted in Spanish society of the time as cocoa. The remaining foodstuffs were relegated to botanical study situations, or incorporated in some new culinary preparations on exceptional occasions and with general reluctance. [...] However, chocolate {{was part of a}} number of seventeenth century palace rituals offered to visitors, as part of the [...] "entertainment". This ritual was that the ladies of the Court offered their female visitors a dose of cocoa along with various sweets (cakes, sweetened bread, muffins and brioches) and <b>a</b> <b>vase</b> <b>of</b> snow. The chocolate was served to visitors who rested on cushions, surrounded by tapestries and the heat of braziers heat. Chocolatadas, the social custom of drinking chocolate in the community, had made their first appearance in Spain.|$|E
