5|$|About 18 percent (40,000) of the Uruguayan {{population}} (220,000) spoke Portuguese {{and regarded}} themselves as Brazilian rather than Uruguayan. Many within Flores' ranks were Brazilians, some hailing {{from the nearby}} Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul. Life along the frontier between Rio Grande do Sul and Uruguay was often chaotic, with hostilities erupting between partisans of various cattle barons, cattle-rustling <b>and</b> <b>random</b> killings. Large landowners {{on both sides of}} the border had long been antagonistic toward Berro's policies. The Uruguayan president attempted to tax the cattle coming from Rio Grande do Sul and to impose curbs on the use of Brazilian slaves within Uruguayan territory; slavery had been outlawed years before in Uruguay.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{consist of}} both story-related boss fights <b>and</b> <b>random</b> {{encounters}} with standard enemies. Battles are turn-based, with the player characters and enemies moving around a small battle arena to perform actions. Once the player {{has laid out}} their strategy in the battle menu, the characters perform their assigned actions until the battle ends with victory for {{one side or the}} player pauses the action to change strategies. Instead of the grid-based battle system from the original Persona, party members and enemy units act in the same phase of a turn, rather than being restricted by their placement on the field.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: In {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) imaging, the main function of scatter <b>and</b> <b>randoms</b> corrections is to improve contrast and quantitative accuracy. Both corrections are essential and critically important. Several iterative reconstruction schemes incorporating scatter <b>and</b> <b>randoms</b> corrections have been developed over the years. In this work, the authors propose a new method to incorporate the scatter <b>and</b> <b>randoms</b> corrections into the iterative image reconstruction, which has shown promising results in regards to improving reconstruction performance and image quality {{as compared to the}} standard methods...|$|R

5|$|Bravely Default, {{known in}} Japan as Bravely Default: Flying Fairy, is a {{role-playing}} video game developed by Silicon Studio for the Nintendo 3DS handheld video game console. Bravely Default was originally released in 2012, while an expanded edition titled For the Sequel released in 2013 in Japan, Europe and Australia, and in 2014 in North America. Square Enix published {{the game in}} Japan, while Nintendo handled publishing duties overseas. The gameplay uses a turn-based battle system and job system, in addition to incorporating options to combine job abilities and adjust battle speed <b>and</b> <b>random</b> encounter rates.|$|E
5|$|Cheng {{related in}} an {{interview}} that Don't Starves development taught Klei a considerable amount {{about the nature of the}} emergent gameplay that was endemic to its open <b>and</b> <b>random</b> world; Klei tries to experiment with a new genre with each project and prefers not to create sequels to any of its games. These lessons would later be used to balance the mechanics of Klei's upcoming project Invisible, Inc.|$|E
5|$|During exploration, {{the player}} enters battle through both story-based boss battles <b>and</b> <b>random</b> {{encounters}} with standard enemies. Combat is turn-based, with enemies facing against a four-member party {{made up of}} the protagonist and three chosen demons. Combat is governed by a derivative of the Press Turn system used in : in Strange Journey, the relevant system is called the Demon Co-op System. If the player group strikes their opponent's weak point, any allied demon of the attacker's aliment will follow up with an unblockable attack which deals high damage.|$|E

5|$|Geisel {{created the}} book in {{response}} to a debate in the United States about literacy in early childhood and the ineffectiveness of traditional primers such as those featuring Dick and Jane. Geisel was asked to write a more entertaining primer by William Spaulding, whom he had met during World War II and who was then director of the education division at Houghton Mifflin. However, because Geisel was already under contract with Random House, the two publishers agreed to a deal: Houghton Mifflin published the education edition, which was sold to schools, <b>and</b> <b>Random</b> House published the trade edition, which was sold in bookstores.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} was {{produced}} by the ABC Studios in association with The Mark Gordon Company <b>and</b> <b>Random</b> Acts Productions. Safran, Gordon, Robert Sertner, Nicholas Pepper and Jake Coburn served as the executive producers. The show was designed to have a flashback narrative, shifting between two timelines. Safran incorporated the flashforward storytelling technique as he thought it allowed them to spread out the plot points.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Chris Marrs Piliero and was released February 25, 2011. The video co-stars actor James Van Der Beek, who plays Kesha's nemesis. Piliero and Kesha {{came up with the}} video's concept and is intended to be simplistic, a video that is cool <b>and</b> <b>random.</b> Reception of the video by critics were positive, with the mid-video dialogue scene's humor being highlighted.|$|E

5|$|Traditional Indonesian wax-resist batik {{designs on}} cloth combine {{representational}} motifs (such as floral and vegetal elements) with abstract and somewhat chaotic elements, including imprecision in applying the wax resist, <b>and</b> <b>random</b> variation introduced by cracking of the wax. Batik designs have a fractal dimension between 1 and 2, varying in different regional styles. For example, the batik of Cirebon has a fractal dimension of 1.1; the batiks of Yogyakarta and Surakarta (Solo) in Central Java have a fractal dimension of 1.2 to 1.5; and the batiks of Lasem {{on the north}} coast of Java and of Tasikmalaya in West Java have a fractal dimension between 1.5 and 1.7.|$|E
5|$|Who's Your City? was {{published}} as a hardcover in March 2008 by Basic Books in the United States <b>and</b> <b>Random</b> House Canada in Canada. A year later, the trade paperback version {{was published}} in the United States. After Canadian reviewers commented on the US-focus of the book, a revised Canadian version, with some studies and maps expanded to include Canada, was published by Vintage Canada as a trade paperback. An international version was published overseas. Excerpts were published in The Globe and Mail newspaper and Fast Company magazine.|$|E
5|$|COBOL {{supports}} three file formats, or : sequential, indexed and relative. In sequential files, {{records are}} contiguous {{and must be}} traversed sequentially, similarly to a linked list. Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be randomly accessed and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a unique key, but other, , record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as Câ€‘ISAM and VSAM, are based on IBM's ISAM. Relative files, like indexed files, have a unique record key, {{but they do not}} have alternate keys. A relative record's key is its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a key of 10. This means that creating a record with a key of 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding records. Relative files also allow for both sequential <b>and</b> <b>random</b> access.|$|E

5|$|Entities {{undergoing}} {{uniparental inheritance}} and {{with little to}} no recombination {{may be expected to}} be subject to Muller's ratchet, the inexorable accumulation of deleterious mutations until functionality is lost. Animal populations of mitochondria avoid this buildup through a developmental process known as the mtDNA bottleneck. The bottleneck exploits stochastic processes in the cell to increase in the cell-to-cell variability in mutant load as an organism develops: a single egg cell with some proportion of mutant mtDNA thus produces an embryo where different cells have different mutant loads. Cell-level selection may then act to remove those cells with more mutant mtDNA, leading to a stabilisation or reduction in mutant load between generations. The mechanism underlying the bottleneck is debated, with a recent mathematical and experimental metastudy providing evidence for a combination of random partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions <b>and</b> <b>random</b> turnover of mtDNA molecules within the cell.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} {{produced}} by the ABC Studios in association with The Mark Gordon Company <b>and</b> <b>Random</b> Acts Productions. Safran, Gordon, Robert Sertner and Nicholas Pepper serve as the executive producers, with Cherien Dabis {{as one of the}} producers. Safran served as the head writer of the series. The writing staff of Quantico consists of Justin Brenneman, Cami Delavigne, Cameron Litvack, Logan Slakter, Gideon Yago, Beth Schacter, Jordon Nardino, and Cherien Dabis, all of whom have written multiple episodes for the series. Various directors have worked on several episodes throughout the series notably Patrick Morris, Jennifer Lynch, David McWhirter, Stephen Kay and Steve Robin. Colleen Sharp, Nicholas Erasmus, Daniel A. Valverde, Terilyn A. Shropshire and Shelby Siegel have edited multiple episodes. The Director of Photography is Anthony Wolberg, who has provided cinematography for the maximum episodes. Other cinematographers include Anastas N. Michos and Todd McMullen. Joel J. Richard and Joseph Trapanese have provided the music for Quantico.|$|E
5|$|The {{tape loops}} were played on BTR3 tape {{machines}} located in various studios of the Abbey Road building {{and controlled by}} EMI technicians in Studio Two at Abbey Road on 7 April. Each machine was monitored by one technician, who had to hold a pencil within each loop to maintain tension. The four Beatles controlled the faders of the mixing console while Martin varied the stereo panning and Emerick watched the meters. Eight of the tapes were used at one time, changed halfway through the song. The tapes were made (like {{most of the other}} loops) by superimposition and acceleration. According to Martin, the finished mix of the tape loops could not be repeated because of the complex <b>and</b> <b>random</b> way in which they were laid over the music.|$|E
