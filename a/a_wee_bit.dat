500|$|Baxter {{was noted}} for {{accurate}} passes, for sending opponents {{the wrong way}} with a swivel of his hips, and for inspiring teammates with his confident approach. He attracted attention by his stylish play, controlling the game with [...] "unhurried artistry". He refused to conform with the [...] "efficient" [...] style that dominated British football or the energetic, physical style that was typical of Rangers at the time. Indeed, although Rangers insisted that players tuck their shirts completely into their shorts, Baxter always let part of his dangle over his left hip. He described his approach to playing football as [...] "treating the ball like a woman. Give it a cuddle, caress it <b>a</b> <b>wee</b> <b>bit,</b> take your time, and you'll get the required response".|$|E
500|$|In 1942, {{the year}} before she died, Potter's {{thoughts}} returned to Kitty MacDonald when she wrote about a piece of crockery:Seventy eighty years ago it belonged to another old woman, old Katie MacDonald, the Highland washerwoman. She was a tiny body, brown as a berry, beady black eyes and much wrinkled, against an incongruously white frilled mutch. She wore a small plaid crossed over shawl pinned with a silver brooch, a bed jacket, and a full kilted petticoat. She dropped bob curtsies, but she was outspoken and very independent, proud and proper ... The joy of converse with old Katie was to draw her out {{to talk of the}} days when she was <b>a</b> <b>wee</b> <b>bit</b> lassie—herding the kine. The days when 'Boney' was a terror ... the old woman wouldn't dwell upon hard weather and storms; she spoke of the sunshine and clouds, and shadows, the heather bells, the ... "the broom of the Cowden Knowes", the sun and wind on the hills where she played, and knitted, and herded cattle and sheep. A bonny life it was, but it never came back ..." ...|$|E
500|$|He left CAI {{at the age}} of 18 {{and began}} a degree in French at the University of Ulster, (formally Ulster Polytechnic) in Jordanstown. He stayed at {{university}} for a year before dropping out. In a 1999 interview, Nesbitt said, [...] "I had the necessary in my head, but I just couldn't be bothered. Being 18 is the worst age to expect people to learn things. There are other things to be bothered with, like girls and football." [...] He made the decision to quit when he was trying to write an overdue essay on existentialism in Les Mains Sales at 4am one day. His father suggested that he should move to England if he wanted to continue acting, so Nesbitt enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), part of University of London. Nesbitt felt lost and misrepresented when he first arrived in London, on account of his Northern Irish background; [...] "When I first came to drama school I was a Paddy the minute I walked in. And I remember going to drama school and them all saying to me, 'Aww, yeah, Brits out', and I was like 'It's <b>a</b> <b>wee</b> <b>bit</b> more complicated than that, you know.'" [...] He graduated in 1987, {{at the age of}} 22.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} several negative reviews. Andrew Billen, writing for The Times, lamented that Davies had [...] "forgotten that Doctor Who's main {{task is to}} send children scuttling behind sofas while entertaining their fathers with the odd philosophical idea, the occasional classical reference, a joke or two they would probably not wish to explain and <b>a</b> <b>wee</b> <b>bit</b> of space totty". Billen also criticised the writing and acting, but commended Tate for a [...] "toned down performance". Alan Stanley Blair of SyFy Portal summarised it as [...] "a runaway Saturday morning cartoon in desperate need to a solid story". Blair found flaws with the comedy and the music in the episode, but was impressed with Tate's acting and Piper's cameo. Kevin O'Sullivan of the Sunday Mirror criticised Tate and Tennant for overacting, and had concerns about the writing: [...] "It didn't exactly ooze tension. All {{we got in the}} way of terrifying space enemies was Sarah Lancashire hamming it up as an intergalactic super nanny, a couple of security guards with guns and lots of cute little fat babies." [...] Ian Hyland of News of the World criticised the child-friendly storyline, comparing it to [...] "the back of a fag packet". He also criticised Tennant for appearing [...] "jaded" [...] and Tate for [...] "still shouting".|$|E

2500|$|On 3 April 2017 it was {{revealed}} that Moyes had made a controversial remark after a post-match interview after Sunderland's goalless draw with Burnley on 18 March. After the interview with the BBC's Vicki Sparks, while the microphone was still audible, Moyes, said: [...] "It was getting <b>a</b> <b>wee</b> <b>bit</b> naughty at the end there so just watch yourself. You still might get a slap even though you’re a woman. Careful the next time you come in". Moyes apologised for the incident. The FA wrote to Moyes to ask for his observations on the incident.|$|E

2500|$|One {{week after}} being sacked as Kerry manager, Ó Sé was {{unveiled}} {{as the new}} manager of the Westmeath senior football team. On Sunday, 10 March 2004, Westmeath took on Jack O'Connor's Kerry team in a fourth-round league match, with Kerry winning by a scoreline of 2-10 to 0-10 victory, as Ó Sé sat on the bench, later admitting in the documentary Marooned that it was [...] "the hardest {{day of my life}} outside bereavements and things like that". Things improved <b>a</b> <b>wee</b> <b>bit</b> and Ó Sé led the county to their first ever Leinster Championship title in his first season in charge. The 0-12 to 0-10 defeat of Laois in the provincial decider proved that Ó Sé was a manager of some considerable skill. However, Westmeath's dream season came to an abrupt halt with a defeat by Derry in the All-Ireland quarter-final.|$|E

50|$|In 1887, {{regional}} businessmen {{hoped that}} Duck Hill {{would become a}} thriving mill town after iron ore was found nearby. Financial speculation followed.

Somehow she got to thinking of her old home, {{and for the first time}} she began to feel just <b>a</b> <b>wee,</b> <b>wee</b> <b>bit</b> homesick. It was just then that she heard a familiar voice.

2500|$|The {{ambulance}} {{arrived at}} the hospital at 2.44am, where Alder was described by one witness who dealt with him as [...] "confused and dazed" [...] and [...] "generally abusive." [...] One of the paramedics from the ambulance crew who had transported him there stated that Alder asked: [...] "Where am I? What's happened?" [...] One of the nurses who treated him also stated that, {{in addition to being}} abusive and swearing at her, he was asking: [...] "Where am I, what am I doing?" [...] Two police officers who were present in the emergency department on an unrelated matter intervened at one point and asked him to cooperate with the nursing staff. They recalled later that he calmed down but remained [...] "confused." [...] PC Dawson and PC Blakey {{arrived at the}} hospital at approximately 3.05am. Alder again became uncooperative with staff at the hospital, and the police control room were informed by the officers at 3.19am: [...] "Our complainant is being <b>a</b> <b>wee</b> <b>bit</b> troublesome.

2500|$|Now I {{will never}} forget this incident... We were at al-Malikiyya, the other {{frontier}} base and word came through about 6 {{o'clock in the morning}} that one of our patrols had been blown up and Millie Law [...] had been killed. Now Gerald Whitfeld [...] had told these mukhtars that if any of this sort of thing happened he would take punitive measures against the nearest village {{to the scene of the}} mine. Well the nearest village to the scene of the mine was a place called al-Bassa and our Company C were ordered to take part in punitive measures. And I {{will never forget}} arriving at al-Bassa and seeing the Rolls Royce armoured cars of the 11th Hussars peppering Bassa with machine gun fire and this went on for about 20minutes and then we went in and I remembered we had lighted braziers and we set the houses on fire and we burnt the village to the ground... Monty had him [...] up and he asked him all about it and Gerald Whitfeld explained to him. He said [...] "Sir, I have warned the mukhtars in these villages that if this happened to any of my officers or men, I would take punitive measures against them and I did this and I would've lost control of the frontier if I hadn't." [...] Monty said [...] "All right but just go <b>a</b> <b>wee</b> <b>bit</b> easier in the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{notes in}} her {{assessment}} of the review: [...] "Once Upon a Time has taken us pretty much everywhere {{in and out of}} fairy tale lore over the past five years: Storybrooke, the Enchanted Forest, Arendelle, Neverland. Tonight, with a return marking the show's midseason premiere, as well as its landmark 100th episode, Once gave us something old (daddy issues), something new (the Underworld), something borrowed (a potion) and something blue (that classic Hades hair)," [...] but later sums up the entire episode: [...] "I know we're going to be dealing with a lot of returning cast in the coming weeks, but admittedly, I was <b>a</b> <b>wee</b> <b>bit</b> let down by the fact this was touted as Once's big reunion episode, and the only significant people we saw from the past were Neal, Cora, and Pan. What I am happy about, though, is the prospect that Regina may end up being wholly important to this Underworld story line. Maybe she'll finally get an arc that's more than just waffling between good and evil. More importantly, it seems like everyone in the Underworld is either in cahoots with Hades or being manipulated by him in some way. Both Pan and Cora were keen on persuading their still-living significant family members, with Cora asking Regina to leave and Pan asking Rumple to save him. I'm interested in seeing exactly what's going on in this little corner of hell and exactly how Once is going to wade through this new road of storytelling.|$|E
60|$|But after a while, {{having nothing}} else to do, Reddy began to think. Now it is {{surprising}} how thinking will change matters. One of the first thoughts that came to Reddy was {{that he might have}} been caught in a trap,--one of those cruel traps that close like a pair of jaws and sometimes break the bones of the foot or leg, and from which there is no escape. Right away Reddy realized that to have been so caught would have been much worse than being a prisoner in Farmer Brown's henyard. This made him feel just <b>a</b> <b>wee,</b> <b>wee</b> <b>bit</b> better, and he began to do some more thinking.|$|R
60|$|So he did it. He had <b>a</b> little <b>wee</b> <b>bit</b> of steamboating, {{and some}} stage-coaching, {{but all the}} rest of the way was horseback, and it took him three weeks to get to Washington. He saw lots of land and lots of villages and four cities. He was gone 'most eight weeks, and there never was such a proud man in the village as he when he got back. His travels made him the {{greatest}} man in all that region, and the most talked about; and people come from as much as thirty miles back in the country, and from over in the Illinois bottoms, too, just to look at him--and there they'd stand and gawk, and he'd gabble. You never see anything like it.|$|R
6000|$|All {{the rest}} of that night Peter sat under a {{friendly}} old bramble-bush {{on the edge of the}} Old Pasture and nursed the sore places made by the claws of Hooty the Owl. At last jolly, round, red Mr. Sun began to climb up in the blue, blue sky, just as he does every day. Peter looked up at him, and he felt sure that Mr. Sun winked at him. Somehow it made him feel better. The fact is, Peter was beginning to feel just <b>a</b> <b>wee,</b> <b>wee</b> <b>bit</b> homesick. It is bad enough to be in a strange place alone, but to be sore and to smart and ache as Peter did makes that lonesome feeling a whole lot harder to bear. It is dreadful not to have any one to speak to, but to look around and not see a single thing you have ever seen before,--my, my, my, it certainly does give you a strange, sinking feeling way down inside! ...|$|R

At first Old Mother Nature refused, but he begged so hard and promised so faithfully never again to be discontented, that finally she relented and took away his tail, all but just <b>a</b> <b>wee</b> little <b>bit.</b> That she left as a reminder lest he should forget the lesson he had learned and should again grow envious.|$|R
