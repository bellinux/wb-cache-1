On the 8th, a serious internal explosion {{occurred in the}} aft <b>auxiliary</b> <b>machinery</b> space above the armor deck. The explosion killed or injured 34 men and prompted the crew to flood the magazines for turret Caesar as a precaution against a magazine explosion.

40|$|Ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) mediates the {{fixation}} {{of atmospheric}} CO 2 in photosynthesis by catalyzing the carboxylation of the 5 -carbon sugar ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate (RuBP). Despite its pivotal role, Rubisco is an inefficient enzyme and thus {{has been a}} key target for bioengineering. However, efforts to increase crop yields by Rubisco engineering remain unsuccessful, {{due in part to}} the complex machinery of molecular chaperones required for Rubisco biogenesis and metabolic repair. While the large subunit of Rubisco generally requires the chaperonin system for folding, the evolution of the hexadecameric Rubisco from its dimeric precursor resulted in the dependence on an array of additional factors required for assembly. Moreover, Rubisco function can be inhibited by a range of sugar-phosphate ligands. Metabolic repair of Rubisco depends on remodeling by the ATP-dependent Rubisco activase and hydrolysis of inhibitors by specific phosphatases.

40|$|As bactérias patogênicas gram-negativas desenvolveram estratégias sofisticadas para infectar seus hospedeiros, utilizando sistemas de secreção especializados para translocar proteínas de virulência através da membrana das células eucarióticas para o citoplasma. Para que este processo seja eficiente, estas proteínas de virulência devem estar parcialmente enoveladas ou mesmo desenoveladas para que possam ser transportadas para o {{interior}} das células hospedeiras através desses sistemas de secreção. Uma vez dentro das células alvo, as proteínas de virulência são encaminhadas ao seu estado nativo e ativadas pela própria maquinaria de enovelamento da célula hospedeira. As proteínas responsáveis em auxiliar o enovelamento protéico nas células são as chaperonas, denominadas classicamente de proteínas de choque térmico (Hsps). Plantas, por serem organismos sésseis, são muito mais vulneráveis a fatores de estresse biótico e abiótico, tornando o papel das Hsps ainda mais relevante para a homeostase protéica e viabilidade celular. O estudo das proteínas da família Hsp 90 é muito difundido devido ao seu papel fundamental desempenhado nas situações de infecção e em diferentes tipos de estresse. Neste trabalho, a proteína recombinante Hsp 90 de laranja doce (Citrus sinesis) foi clonada e purificada com o objetivo de estudar o mecanismo geral de infecção do fitopatógeno bacteriano de espécies de citros Xanthomonas citri (Xac). Investigou-se a interação, combinando técnicas de {{western blot}} e ensaios de pull-down, entre a Hsp 90 e todas as quatro variantes da PthA, principal fator de virulência de Xac, e as co-chaperonas da Hsp 90 de laranja ciclofilina (Cyp) e uma proteína tiorredoxina-"like? (TDX). Estas proteínas já foram descritas por se apresentarem reguladas positivamente na laranja doce durante a infecção com Xac, apontando para um possível papel da Hsp 90 na formação de um complexo de enovelamento capaz de ativar as proteínas de virulência de Xac no interior das células infectadas. Além disso, investigamos a estrutura e função da Hsp 90 de laranja doce que apresentou-se enovelada e solúvel, como medido por dicroísmo circular (CD), espectroscopia de fluorescência intrínseca e espalhamento de luz dinâmico (DLS). A Hsp 90 se apresentou como um dímero em solução com um raio de Stokes de 62 Å, e altamente resistente á desnaturação por temperatura, como medido por CD. A proteína mostrou-se funcional, como medido pela sua capacidade de proteger a agregação da citrato sintase in vitro em um ensaio de espalhamento de luz. O estudo do efeito de nucleotídeos na conformação e função da Hsp 90 através de CD, fluorescência intrínseca e de espalhamento de raios-X a baixos ângulos (SAXS) mostram alterações na conformação da proteína na presença destes ligantes. Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, which have developed sophisticated strategies to infect hosts, use specialized secretion systems to secrete and translocate virulence proteins across the eukaryotic cell membrane into the cytoplasm. The translocation process depends on unfolded or partially folded virulence proteins to be transportated through the secretion system into the target inner cell {{where they are}} folded by the host chaperone <b>machinery.</b> <b>Auxiliary</b> proteins are responsible to help folding in cells and are known as molecular chaperones, or heat shock proteins (HSPs). Plants, being sessile organisms, are much more vulnerable to biotic and abiotic stress factors, making the role of HSPs even more important for protein homeostasis and cell viability. The study of the Hsp 90 family is widespread due to the key role played in situations of infection and under various types of stress. In this work, an Hsp 90 sweet orange (Citrus sinesis) was cloned and purified in order to study the general mechanism of infection of the bacterial pathogen of citrus species, Xanthomonas citri (Xac). First, we investigated the interaction, by combining immunostaining and pull-down assays, between Hsp 90 and all four variants of PthA, the major virulence factor of Xac, and the orange Hsp 90 cochaperonas cyclophilin (Cyp) and a thioredoxin-like protein (TDX). These proteins have been described to be upregulated in sweet orange during infection with Xac, pointing to a possible role of Hsp 90 {{in the formation of}} a folding complex able to activate the virulence proteins of Xac inside the infected cells. Furthermore, we took to investigate the structure and function of the Hsp 90 from sweet orange, which was folded and soluble as measured by circular dichroism (CD), intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Hsp 90 was a dimer in solution with a Stokes radius of about 62 Å, tolerating up to 90 °C without denaturation, as measured by CD. The protein was functional, as measured by its ability to protect the aggregation of citrate synthase in an light scattering assay. The study of the effect of nucleotides on the conformation and function of Hsp 90 by CD, intrinsic fluorescence and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) show evidence of conformation modulation by ATP and ADP...|$|R
