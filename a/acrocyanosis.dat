50|$|Although {{there is}} no {{definitive}} reporting on its incidence, <b>acrocyanosis</b> shows prevalence in {{children and young adults}} than in patients thirty years of age or older. Epidemiological data suggests that cold climate, outdoor occupation, and low body mass index are significant risk factors for developing <b>acrocyanosis.</b> As expected, <b>acrocyanosis</b> would be more prevalent in women than in men due to differences in BMI. However, the incidence rate of <b>acrocyanosis</b> often decreases with increasing age, regardless of regional climate. It completely resolves in many women after menopause implying significant hormonal influences.|$|E
50|$|While {{there is}} no cure for <b>acrocyanosis,</b> {{patients}} otherwise have excellent prognosis. Unless <b>acrocyanosis</b> results from another condition (e.g. malignancy, antiphospholipid syndrome, atherosclerosis, acute ischemic limb, bacterial endocarditis), {{there is no}} associated increased risk of disease or death, and there are no known complications. Aside from the discoloration, there are no other symptoms: no pain, and no loss of function. Patients can expect to lead normal lives. In secondary <b>acrocyanosis</b> treatment of the primary condition defines outcomes.|$|E
5000|$|The precise {{mechanism}} of <b>acrocyanosis</b> is not known. The current {{line of thinking}} goes that vasospasms in the cutaneous arteries and arterioles produce cyanotic discoloration, while compensatory dilatation in the postcapillary venules causes sweating. Arteriovenous subpapillary plexus shunting also occurs. [...] Persistent vasoconstriction at the precapillary sphincter creates a local hypoxic environment, thus releasing adenosine into the capillary bed. Vasospasms force adenosine to enter the capillary bed, where it vasodilates the postcapillary venules. Such differences in vessel tone create a countercurrent exchange system that attempts to retain heat. Profuse sweating would then be caused by an overwhelmed countercurrent exchange system. In addition to adenosine, other hormones may contribute to <b>acrocyanosis</b> such as increase blood levels of serotonin. This would seem to support case studies reporting <b>acrocyanosis</b> as an unusual side effect for pediatric patients taking tricyclic antidepressants, as these medications can inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and thus increase their blood concentrations. <b>Acrocyanosis</b> {{has been reported in}} association with many other medications and substances.|$|E

5000|$|In 1912 {{he first}} {{described}} a circulatory disease marked by {{an association of}} ovarian insufficiency and <b>acrocyanosis</b> with vasomotor-trophic disturbance of the skin, and disturbances of sensitivity caused by dysregulation of the vegetative nervous system which has been given the eponymic name of [...] "Cassirer's syndrome" [...] or [...] "Crocq-Cassirer syndrome".|$|E
50|$|Skin changes: Skin changes {{occur in}} 68% to 89% of POEMS {{syndrome}} patients. These changes most commonly are hyperpigmentation and/or hypertrichosis (abnormal amount of hair {{growth over the}} body) but less commonly include glomeruloid hemangioma, signs or symptoms of Hypervolemia (e.g. edema and ascites), <b>acrocyanosis</b> (blue discoloration of the extremities due to blood flow abnormalities), flushing, and/or white nails.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Acrocyanosis</b> {{may be a}} sign of a {{more serious}} medical problem, such as {{connective}} tissue diseases and diseases associated with central cyanosis. Other causative conditions include infections, toxicities, antiphospholipid syndrome, cryoglobulinemia, neoplasms. In these cases, the observed cutaneous changes are known as [...] "secondary acrocyanosis". They may have a less symmetric distribution and may be associated with pain and tissue loss.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{described}} over 100 {{years ago}} and not uncommon in practice, {{the nature of this}} phenomenon is still uncertain. The very term [...] "acrocyanosis" [...] is often applied inappropriately in cases when blue discoloration of the hands, feet, or parts of the face is noted.The principal (primary) form of <b>acrocyanosis</b> is that of a benign cosmetic condition, sometimes caused by a relatively benign neurohormonal disorder. Regardless of its cause, the benign form typically does not require medical treatment. A medical emergency would ensue if the extremities experience prolonged periods of exposure to the cold, particularly in children and patients with poor general health. However, frostbite differs from <b>acrocyanosis</b> because pain (via thermal nociceptors) often accompanies the former condition, while the latter is very rarely associated with pain. There are also a number of other conditions that affect hands, feet, and parts of the face with associated skin color changes that need to be differentiated from acrocyanosis: Raynaud’s phenomenon, pernio, acrorygosis, erythromelalgia, blue finger syndrome. The diagnosis may be challenging in some cases, especially when these syndromes co-exist.|$|E
50|$|In up to {{one third}} of people with POTS, fainting occurs in {{response}} to postural changes or exercise. Migraine-like headaches are common, sometimes with symptoms worsening in an upright position (orthostatic headache). Some people with POTS develop <b>acrocyanosis,</b> or blotchy, red/blue skin upon standing, especially over the feet (indicative of blood pooling). 48% of people with POTS report chronic fatigue and 32% report sleep disturbances. Others exhibit only the cardinal symptom of orthostatic tachycardia.|$|E
50|$|Tolazoline is a non-selective {{competitive}} α-adrenergic receptor antagonist. It is a vasodilator {{that is used}} {{to treat}} spasms of peripheral blood vessels (as in <b>acrocyanosis).</b> It has also been used (in conjunction with sodium nitroprusside) successfully as an antidote to reverse the severe peripheral vasoconstriction which can occur as a result of overdose with certain 5-HT2A agonist drugs such as 25I-NBOMe, DOB and Bromodragonfly (prolonged severe vasoconstriction can lead to gangrene if untreated).|$|E
50|$|There is no {{standard}} {{medical or}} surgical treatment for <b>acrocyanosis,</b> and treatment, other than reassurance and avoidance of cold, is usually unnecessary. The patient is reassured that no serious illness is present. A sympathectomy would alleviate the cyanosis by disrupting the fibers of the {{sympathetic nervous system}} to the area. However, such an extreme procedure would rarely be appropriate. Treatment with vasoactive drugs is not recommended but traditionally is mentioned as optional. However, there is little, if any, empirical evidence that vasoactive drugs (α-adrenergic blocking agents or calcium channel blockers) are effective.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acrocyanosis</b> is {{diagnosed}} clinically, {{based on a}} medical history and physical examination; laboratory studies or imaging studies are not necessary. The normal peripheral pulses rule out peripheral arterial occlusive disease, where arterial narrowing limits {{blood flow to the}} extremities. Pulse oximetry will show a normal oxygen saturation. Unlike the closely related Raynaud's phenomenon, cyanosis is continually persistent. In addition, there is usually no associated trophic skin changes, localized pain, or ulcerations. Capillaroscopy and other laboratory methods may be helpful but only complement clinical diagnosis in unclear cases, especially when they connective tissue disorders may be present.|$|E
5000|$|Neurologic {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} include progressively delayed development, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures, and abnormal movements. The body's network of blood vessels is also affected. Children with this disorder may experience rashes of tiny red spots (petechiae) caused by bleeding under the skin and blue discoloration in the hands and feet due to reduced oxygen in the blood (<b>acrocyanosis).</b> Chronic diarrhea is another common feature of ethylmalonic encephalopathy. [...] EE is often identified by urine organic acid analysis, the excretion of ethylmalonic acid, methylsuccinic acid, isobutyrylglycine and isovalerylglucine. Patients will also often have elevated thiosulphate concentration in their urine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acrocyanosis</b> is {{characterized}} by peripheral cyanosis: persistent cyanosis of the hands or of the hands, feet, or face. The extremities often are cold and clammy and may exhibit some swelling (especially in the warmer weather). The palms and soles exhibit {{a wide range of}} sweating from moderately moist to profuse, but all peripheral pulses should have normal rate, rhythm, and quality. Exposure to cold temperatures worsens the cyanosis, while it often improves on warming. Aside from the color changes, patients normally are asymptomatic and therefore there is usually no associated pain. The most common sign, discoloration, usually is what prompts patients to seek medical care.|$|E
50|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{due to the}} cryoglobulins of type I disease reflect the hyperviscosity and deposition of cryoglobulins within the blood vessels which reduce or stop blood perfusion to tissues. These events occur particularly in cases where blood cryoglobulin levels of monoclonal IgM are high in patients with IgM MGUS, smoldering Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, or Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and in uncommon cases where the levels of monoclonal IgA, IgG, free κ light chains, or free λ light chains are extremely high in patients with non-IgM MGUS, non-IgM smoldering multiple myeloma, or multiple myeloma. The interruption of blood flow to neurological tissues can cause symptoms of confusion, headache, hearing loss, and peripheral neuropathy. Interruption of blood flow to other tissues in type I disease can cause cutaneous manifestations of purpura, <b>acrocyanosis,</b> necrosis, ulcers, and livedo reticularis; spontaneous nose bleeds, joint pain, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; and cardiovascular disturbances such as shortness of breath, hypoxemia, and congestive heart failure.|$|E
5000|$|Patients {{suffering}} type 1 cryoglobulinemia {{present with}} symptoms due to cold temperature-induce blood hyperviscosity and consequential interruptions of blood flow, e.g. skin lesions (lower extremity purpuric spots and papules, <b>acrocyanosis,</b> necrosis skin ulcers, livedo reticularis urticaria), peripheral neuropathy, blurred vision, loss of vision, hearing loss, headaches, confusion, transient ischemic attacks, chest pain, heart failure, glomerulonephritis, renal failure, oral bleeding, and nasal bleeding. Rarely, patients may present with catastrophic decreases in {{blood flow to}} vital tissues and require emergency treatment. Symptomatic patients typically exhibit levels of a myeloma protein >5 gram/liter and can be diagnosed by simple observing the temperature-induced, reversible induction of serum precipitate formation. Patients, particularly those with catastrophic presentations, are treated with plasma exchange and/or plasmapharesis to reduce the load of circulating myeloma proteins and relieve acute symptoms. Patients with an overt malignancy are treated with the chemotherapy regimens used for Waldenstroms macroglobulinemia or multiply myeloma; patients with MGUS precursors to these diseases appear less reaponsive to these chemotherapeutic regimens. These patients as well as patients with overt malignancy may be treated with rituximab (kills normal and malignant B cells that bear the CD20 antigen or the proteasome inhibitor, Bortezomib.|$|E
40|$|Raynaud's {{phenomenon}} (RP) is {{an extremely}} unusual finding in early infancy. In the present report we describe a one-month-old previously healthy male infant who presented with unilateral <b>acrocyanosis.</b> Although infantile <b>acrocyanosis</b> {{is known to be}} a benign and self-resolving condition, it is generally bilateral and symmetric. The unilateral nature of the <b>acrocyanosis</b> was an atypical finding in this infant. Consequently, he was closely monitored to evaluate the progression of his <b>acrocyanosis.</b> Based on his benign clinical course and failure to demonstrate other etiologies contributing to his <b>acrocyanosis,</b> he was diagnosed to have primary RP.

40|$|Autonomic {{functions}} in <b>acrocyanosis</b> assessed by {{heart rate variability}} Objective: To evaluate the autonomic activity of patients with <b>acrocyanosis</b> by using heart rate variability indices. Material and Methods: The study group consisted of 24 patients with <b>acrocyanosis</b> and the control group contained 22 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects. All subjects underwent 24 -hour Holter monitoring. Among the heart rate variability (HRV) parameters, time-domain and frequency-domain indices were analysed. Results: The time-domain indices of HRV indicating global autonomic functions {{were found to be}} increased, and indices indicating parasympathetic activity showed a significant decrease in the patient group. Power-spectral analysis of HRV revealed that the low frequency and high frequency power were higher in the patient group than in controls. However, the ratio of Low Frequency/High Frequency was found to be lower in the patient group than in controls. Conclusion: In <b>acrocyanosis,</b> both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems seem to be disrupted. Therefore, we may conclude that <b>acrocyanosis</b> may be resulted of systemic autonomic imbalance rather than pure sympathetic over-activation. Also, these results suggest that <b>acrocyanosis</b> is not a localised disorder; on the contrary, it is associated with various abnormalities of the systemic autonomic nervous system.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{prognostic}} significance of scleroderma capillary pattern (SD-pattern) in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon. Thirty patients with a capillaroscopy examination suggestive of scleroderma (megacapillaries and/or avascularity) but without clinical criteria of scleroderma (ARA criteria) were reevaluated 6 years after the initial clinical and capillaroscopy examinations. SD-pattern abnormalities were classified according to a semiquantitative method. Eight out of the 28 evaluated patients (28 %) developed a scleroderma spectrum disorder (SDS). The presence of avascularity and/or a mean of more than two megacapillaries digit greatly enhanced the percentage of evolution toward SDS (70 %/ 88 % respectively). Most of the patients with few enlarged capillaries and no capillary rarefaction at entry had primary <b>acrocyanosis</b> (11 / 15). None of them developed SDS. The microangiopathy disappeared during the follow-up period in most of these patients (14 / 15). These results confirm the prognostic value of SD-pattern capillary abnormalities for SDS.

40|$|<b>Acrocyanosis</b> is a {{condition}} in which the ex-tremities are cold and blue. It differs from Ray-naud's disease in that it does not occur in attacks, but is relatively permanent, and in that there is no sharp line of demarcation separating the nor-mal skin from the abnormal areas. Lewis and Landis (1) believe that the fault lies in an exces-sive sensitivity to cold {{on the part of the}} small vessels of the extremities. This sensitivity results in spasm of the arterioles and a secondary dila-tion of the venous capillaries. Villaret and co-workers (2) and Kreindler and Elias (3) believe that the cause is hypertonicity of the sympathetic nervous system. Elliott, Evans, and Stone (4) emphasize chiefly a local fault of the small vessels, but they recognize that centrally arising impulses may be contributory. They feel that there is merely dilation and atonicity of the venules and venous capillaries rather than spasm of the arteri-oles. Pearse (5) believes that in Raynaud's dis-ease sensitivity of the vessels causes an exag-gerated vascular response to normal influences, whether local or general. It is the purpose of this paper to describe a study of the spontaneous warming of the hands and feet in sleep in a case of <b>acrocyanosis.</b> The facts collected lend support to the theory that the condition in this case may be the result of vaso-constrictive influences arising from central por-tions of the sympathetic nervous system and not directly related to the temperature of the environ-ment...|$|E
