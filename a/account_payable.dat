50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, advance deposits are {{an example}} of an <b>account</b> <b>payable</b> found in the city ledger. When a guest pays a deposit prior to registration, the hotel incurs an <b>account</b> <b>payable</b> to the guest for services to be rendered in the future. Advance deposits from all guests are collected in a common advance deposit account. This amount is then transferred back to the guest's front-office account (folio) upon check-in.|$|E
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of accounts in the city ledger are accounts receivable (one notable exception is the advance deposit account discussed below, which is an <b>account</b> <b>payable).</b>|$|E
50|$|Under IFRS {{items are}} always shown based on {{liquidity}} from the least liquid assets at the top, usually {{land and buildings}} to the most liquid, i.e. cash. Then liabilities and equity continue from the most immediate liability to be paid (usual <b>account</b> <b>payable)</b> to the least i.e. long term debt such a mortgages and owners equity at the very bottom.|$|E
50|$|A more {{complete}} definition is that current liabilities are obligations {{that will be}} settled by current assets or by {{the creation of new}} current liabilities. <b>Accounts</b> <b>payable</b> are due within 30 days, and are paid within 30 days, but do often run past 30 days or 60 days in some situations. The laws regarding late payment and claims for unpaid <b>accounts</b> <b>payable</b> is related to the issue of <b>accounts</b> <b>payable.</b> An operating cycle for a firm is the average time that is required to go from cash to cash in producing revenues. For example, <b>accounts</b> <b>payable</b> for goods, services or supplies that were purchased for use in the operation of the business and payable within a normal period would be current liabilities. Amounts listed on a balance sheet as <b>accounts</b> <b>payable</b> represent allbills payable to vendors of a company, whether or not the bills are less than 31 days old or more than 30 days old. Therefore, late payments are not disclosed on the balance sheet for <b>accounts</b> <b>payable.</b> There may be footnotes in audited financial statements regarding age of <b>accounts</b> <b>payable,</b> but this is not common accounting practice. Lawsuits regarding <b>accounts</b> <b>payable</b> are required to be shown on audited financial statements, but this is not necessarily common accounting practice.|$|R

50|$|<b>Accounts</b> <b>payable</b> {{automation}} or AP automation is a {{term used}} to describe the ongoing effort of many companies to streamline the business process of their <b>accounts</b> <b>payable</b> departments. The <b>accounts</b> <b>payable</b> department's main responsibility is to process and review transactions between the company and its suppliers. In other words, it is the <b>accounts</b> <b>payable</b> department's job to make sure all outstanding invoices from their suppliers are approved, processed, and paid. Processing an invoice includes recording important data from the invoice and inputting it into the company’s financial, or bookkeeping, system. After this is accomplished, the invoices must go through the company’s respective business process in order to be paid.|$|R
50|$|Again, {{notice that}} the amounts paid {{are the same as}} in the cash flow hedge. The big {{difference}} here is that the adjustments are made directly to the assets and not to the other comprehensive income holding account. This is because this type of hedge is more concerned with the fair value of the asset or liability (in this case the <b>account</b> <b>payable)</b> than it is with the profit and loss position of the entity.|$|E
5000|$|Self-billing invoice - A self billing invoice is {{when the}} buyer issues the invoice to himself (e.g. {{according}} to the consumption levels he is taking out of a vendor-managed inventory stock). The buyer (i.e. the issuer) should treat the invoice as an <b>account</b> <b>payable,</b> and the seller should treat it as an account receivable. If there is tax on the sale, e.g. VAT or GST, then buyer and seller may need to adjust their tax accounts in accordance with tax legislation.|$|E
5000|$|Pro forma invoice — In foreign trade, a {{pro forma}} invoice is a {{document}} that states a commitment from the seller to provide specified goods to the buyer at specific prices. It {{is often used to}} declare value for customs. It is not an actual invoice, and thus the seller does not record a pro forma invoice as an account receivable and the buyer does not record a pro forma invoice as an <b>account</b> <b>payable.</b> A pro forma invoice is not issued by the seller until the seller and buyer have agreed to the terms of the order. In a few cases, a pro forma invoice is issued to request advance payments from the buyer, either to allow production to start or for security of the goods produced.|$|E

50|$|An {{accounts}} payable is {{recorded in the}} <b>Account</b> <b>Payable</b> sub-ledger at the time an invoice is vouched for payment. Vouchered, or vouched, means that an invoice is approved for payment and has been recorded in the General Ledger or AP subledger as an outstanding, or open, liability because {{it has not been}} paid. Payables are often categorized as Trade Payables, payables for the purchase of physical goods that are recorded in Inventory, and Expense Payables, payables for the purchase of goods or services that are expensed. Common examples of Expense Payables are advertising, travel, entertainment, office supplies and utilities. A/P is a form of credit that suppliers offer to their customers by allowing them to pay for a product or service after it has already been received. Suppliers offer various payment terms for an invoice. Payment terms may include the offer of a cash discount for paying an invoice within a defined number of days. For example, 2%, Net 30 terms mean that the payer will deduct 2% from the invoice if payment is madewithin 30 days. If the payment is made on Day 31 then the full amount is paid.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Earnings Management (EM) is {{an effort}} {{performed}} by company management as financial report issuer on purpose to influence the readers and stakeholders behavior who rely on financial reports as their primary information source, in accordance with firm managements’ direction.   EM motivations may vary, from remuneration reason, merger and acquisition event, to comply with particular requirement and regulation, to initial public offering (IPO) motivation. This study revealed EM effort in IPO event due to management motivation to demonstrate good performance to public before and during such activity. This study took 50 IPO firms listed at Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) within 1998 - 2002. EM detection adopted Modified Jones Model as a powerful model to detect EM. Test result proved that EM was occurred on JSX IPO firms as stated by positive discretionary accruals (DA).                  Further study tried to reveal accounts used as EM tools. This study utilized linear regression with DA as fixed variable to indicate EM and predicted accounts on financial reports used as way to do EM as explanatory variables. Such explanatory variables are account receivable, <b>account</b> <b>payable,</b> inventory, accrued liability, accumulated depreciation, expenses (selling and general administrative) and other income (expense). Test result showed that only two variables statistically significant to dependent variable, i. e. DA, they were account receivable and <b>account</b> <b>payable.</b> This result supports a study by Marquardt and Wiedman (2002) who found that EM during IPO activity was influenced by account receivable in positive direction. However, this study does not support Wiedyaningdyah (2001) who concluded IPO activity in JSX during 1994 - 1997 was significantly influenced by liability (leverage). This study recommends investors or any other parties who rely on firm financial report during IPO activity on JSX to behave more conservative on net income as reported by related firms and considers account receivable and <b>account</b> <b>payable</b> as accounts need to be reviewed prior to any economical decision making related to the financial reports.
