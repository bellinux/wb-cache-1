5|$|In 2007, the {{government}} unveiled {{a proposal to}} redevelop the area surrounding the historic Albert Hall into a tourist <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> precinct. This included the building of an eight-storey building and the rezoning of some waterfront land currently designated as cultural to commercial. It was met with widespread hostility from heritage activists and the general community, which submitted more than 3,300 signatories in a petition against the scheme.

5|$|The {{blurring}} or {{diffusion of}} the Republic's more rigid hierarchies led to increased social mobility under the Empire, both upward and downward, {{to an extent}} that exceeded that of all other well-documented ancient societies. Women, freedmen, and slaves had opportunities to profit and exercise influence in ways previously less available to them. Social life in the Empire, particularly for those whose personal resources were limited, was further fostered by a proliferation of voluntary associations and confraternities (collegia and sodalitates) formed for various purposes: professional and trade guilds, veterans' groups, religious sodalities, drinking <b>and</b> <b>dining</b> clubs, performing arts troupes, and burial societies.|$|E
