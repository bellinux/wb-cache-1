5|$|Though {{convection}} later {{began to}} consolidate {{into a small}} central dense overcast (CDO) feature by March28, continued disruption of the low-level inflow prevented much development. Météo-France noted that despite forecasting the storm to peak <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>moderate</b> tropical storm, with winds of 75km/h (45mph), there was potential for rapid intensification due to the storm's small size. Conversely, the JTWC noted that proximity to land and dry mid-level air, represented by surface outflow boundaries, could hamper significant development. Once further over the Mozambique Channel, the system became increasingly organized and the JTWC initiated advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 21S. Météo-France followed suit at 0000UTC on March29 and classified the cyclone <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>moderate</b> tropical storm, with the tropical cyclone warning center in Madagascar assigning the name Hellen. Hellen soon assumed an east-southeast track toward Madagascar as a ridge established itself to the northeast.

5|$|Born in Hodgenville, Kentucky, Lincoln {{grew up on}} {{the western}} {{frontier}} in Kentucky and Indiana. Largely self-educated, he became a lawyer in Illinois, a Whig Party leader, and was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives, in which he served for eight years. Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1846, Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy and opposed the Mexican–American War. After a single term, he returned to Illinois and resumed his successful law practice. Reentering politics in 1854, he became a leader in building the new Republican Party, which had a statewide majority in Illinois. As part of the 1858 campaign for US Senator from Illinois, Lincoln took part in a series of highly publicized debates with his opponent and rival, Democrat Stephen A. Douglas; Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery, but lost the race to Douglas. In 1860, Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>moderate</b> from a swing state, though most delegates originally favored other candidates. Though he gained very little support in the slaveholding states of the South, he swept the North and was elected president in 1860.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the effect that the country of design and the country of {{manufacture}} has on the perceived quality of a product, and the role of involvement <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>moderating</b> variable. The conceptual framework has been tested using laboratory experiments that included a 2 x 2 x 2 between the subject’s factorial designs.

The results indicate that there is no difference between the high and low points of a product’s perceived quality, based on its country of design. Conversely, a favorable country of manufacture results in a higher perceived quality for its products, than for those of a lower scoring country of manufacture. Furthermore, consumers’ involvement, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>moderating</b> variable, limits the strength of the country of design and the perceived quality’s relationship as this relationship is found to be stronger in circumstances where the consumers’ involvement is greater than in the less involved group’s condition.
