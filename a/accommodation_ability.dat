The nerve also contains fibers that innervate the muscles that enable pupillary constriction and <b>accommodation</b> (<b>ability</b> to focus on near objects as in reading).

50|$|The {{fact that}} optical powers are {{approximately}} additive enables an {{eye care professional}} to prescribe corrective lenses as a simple correction to the eye's optical power, rather than doing {{a detailed analysis of}} the entire optical system (the eye and the lens). Optical power {{can also be used to}} adjust a basic prescription for reading. Thus an eye care professional, having determined that a myopic (nearsighted) person requires a basic correction of, say, −2 dioptres to restore normal distance vision, might then make a further prescription of 'add 1' for reading, to make up for lack of <b>accommodation</b> (<b>ability</b> to alter focus). This is the same as saying that −1 dioptre lenses are prescribed for reading.|$|E
40|$|Fretting wear {{tests of}} a NiTi {{shape memory alloy}} plate against a GCr 15 steel ball (NiTi/GCr 15) were {{performed}} on a horizontal servo-hydraulic fretting test machine at various temperatures. As a comparison, fretting wear tests of a GCr 15 steel plate against a GCr 15 steel ball were also conducted under the same experimental conditions. The fretting behavior of GCr 15 and NiTi alloy was studied by analyzing both the frictional logs (variation of the tangential force F, and displacement D {{with the number of}} fretting cycles N) and fretting scar features. The experiments showed that NiTi exhibits much better fretting behavior than GCr 15 steel even with a relatively low hardness at room temperature. With an increase in temperature from 22 to 200 degrees C, while the fretting behavior of GCr 15 is almost temperature independent, the range of the partial slip regime of NiTi/GCr 15 becomes small and the fretting wear resistance of NiTi is found to anomalously decrease with an increase in nominal hardness. It was demonstrated that the unique temperature dependent phase transition properties of NiTi {{play a key role in}} its fretting behavior. The stress-induced phase transition not only greatly improves the elastic <b>accommodation</b> <b>ability</b> of NiTi through the large recoverable deformation, but also increases its fretting wear resistance through the transformation shielding effect. With the increasing temperature, the elastic <b>accommodation</b> <b>ability</b> of NiTi decreases not only because of the increase of austenite elastic modulus and phase transition stress but also the plastic deformation of austenite, which in turn causes a small range of the partial slip regime in the NiTi/GCr 15 pair. As the temperature increases, the decrease in fretting wear resistance is attributed to the decrease in the elastic <b>accommodation</b> <b>ability</b> of NiTi and the plastic yield of austenite before phase transition at high temperatures.

The cornea functions as a protective membrane and a “window” through which light rays pass to the retina. In the ideal refractive state, emmetropia, an image is focused directly on the retina, resulting {{in the perception of}} a sharp image in a healthy visual system. In myopia (nearsightedness), the image appears focused anterior to the retina, producing a sharp image at near and a blurred image at distance. The inverse is true in hypermetropia (farsightedness), where the image is projected posterior to the retina, producing a blurred image at near and a sharper image at distance. Astigmatism (cylindrical error) is the result of two different refractive powers between two perpendicular meridians.

40|$|Abstract—As the {{streaming}} of multimedia-rich contents such as {{videos and}} music is an increasingly popular Internet service, more traffic flows require real-time performance. For this reason, Traffic Engineering (TE) with consideration of real-time traffic delay requirements {{is essential to}} accommodate traffic effectively and lower the link congestion occurrence rate. Most previous studies used equations that require traffic changes also in real-time traffic flows when traffic changes require re-calculation of the routes and did not overcome the risk of degrading transmitted data quality. In this paper, we examine the Simplified Delay-guaranteed Traffic Engineering Method (SDG-TE), which allows us to use TE only for traffic that has no delay requirements and use shortest routes for real-time traffic flows without recalculation even if traffic changes occur. We assume that the total traffic contains {{is a certain amount}} of real-time traffic. Simulations show that SDG-TE eliminates route change risks for real-time traffic and real-time traffic can be accommodated effectively without major degradation unlike TE-based traffic schemes. Also, evaluations on the traffic <b>accommodation</b> <b>ability</b> of SDG-TE under the assumption that there some traffic distributions can be predicted suggest that if we assign an adequate volume of real-time traffic, SDG-TE can realize networks with shortest routes that carry 90 percent or more of each maximum traffic volume that can be accommodated.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAccording to the Helmholtz {{theory of}} {{accommodation}} {{the loss of}} accommodation amplitude {{is caused by the}} growing sclerosis of the crystalline lens, whereas the ciliary muscle and the lens capsule are mainly uneffected by age. A permanent treatment method for presbyopia which offers a dynamic <b>accommodation</b> <b>ability</b> is a recent field of study. The concept followed in this paper uses femtosecond laser pulses to potentially overcome the loss of deformation ability of the crystalline lens by creating gliding planes inside the lens tissue to improve its flexibility. MethodsThe aim of the study is to show that the flexibility of human donor lenses can be increased by applying tightly focused near infrared femtosecond laser pulses into the lens tissue. Thereby the tissue is separated by the photodisruption effect. A certain pattern of gliding planes is cut inside the tissue of 41 human donor lenses and the deformation ability of the lenses are compared using the Fisher spinning test before and after laser treatment. ResultsThe laser treatment results in an increased deformation ability of the crystalline lens. The lens a–p thickness increases on average by 97 μm± 14 μm after the treatment. The Fisher spinning test shows an increase of 16 % in deformation ability of the lens at a rotational speed of 1620 rpm. ConclusionThe creation of gliding planes with a fs laser inside the crystalline lens tissue can change the deformation ability of the lens. This might be an indication for a possible method to treat presbyopia in future...|$|E

40|$|Relying on the {{analysis}} of the author and his co-worker’s data, this overview substantiates the basic propositions of the multilevel wave model in fracture mesomechanics. Any solid under loading is considered as a self-organized multilevel system where plastic flow and fracture are two subsequent stages of shear-stability loss at the micro-, meso- and macroscale levels. Fracture is global shear-stability loss in a loaded specimen. Two parallel ({{in the shape of a}} dipole) or conjugate (in the shape of a cross) macrobands of plastic flow localization propagate throughout the specimen cross section. They evolve self-consistently by the “phase wave ” mechanism. The macrobands are characterized by strongly localized material rotation, which is accompanied by mesofragmentation of the surrounding material as the accommodation mechanism of rotation. For macrobands conjugated in the shape of a cross there are two kinds of their self-consistency. At the first stage, the self-consistency between two half-macrobands at each side of the specimen takes place. The rotation modes of the two coupled half-macrobands are accommodated by mesofragmentation of the surrounding material. It is accompanied by the formation of a ductile neck. At the definite extent of mesofragmentation the <b>accommodation</b> <b>ability</b> of the deformed material within the area of coupled macrobands is exhausted. Then the self-consistency between the coupled half-macrobands at each side of the specimen breaks down and the neck formation is stopped. At the second stage of loading, there arises the self-consistency between half-macrobands from the opposite sides of the specimen. It is accompanied by crack propagation throughout the cross section and causes fracture of the loaded specimen. For the dipole configuration of the two opposite macrobands their self-consistency across the entire cross section arises from the very beginning. It results in quasi-brittle fracture of the specimen. The prefracture criterion of a solid under loading based on a multilevel wave model is discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|When {{performing}} visually demanding {{tasks such}} as reading on a smartphone, users can incur excessive ocular stress because of small image size. Such stress is likely exacerbated by lower display resolution, improper ambient lighting, and less ideal subpixel arrangement that further degrade image appearance. Senior users (40 years and older) should be more affected by these factors because of their degraded <b>accommodation</b> <b>ability.</b> The present study evaluated effects of these smartphone properties on visual performance, discomfort, and preference of young and senior adult viewers. To this end, young (age 18 to 30) and senior (age 40 to 65) adults performed visual discrimination and reading tasks on three phones with vertical strip LCD, PenTile OLED, and vertical strip OLED displays that differed on resolution and subpixel structures. Their viewing distance and visual performance were measured in visual discrimination task, and also perceived discomfort in reading task. Subjective comparisons of display properties for the tested phones were also conducted with text, photo, and video images. Our findings revealed that LCD resulted in better discrimination of Landolt C orientation (with fixed target distance) and enabled longer viewing distances in the reading task compared to OLEDs. OLED displays were better in displaying red and blue text, whereas LCD was better in displaying black 2 ̆ 6 white and green text. Senior viewers performed more poorly on the Landolt Ring task with fixed viewing distance, but less so with LCD display and self-adjusted distance. Viewing symptoms were mostly greater with higher illumination, and not affected by tested phones alone. Young viewers preferred LCD displays to OLEDs, but seniors showed no preference. The present findings suggest that screens with higher resolution and better subpixel structure afford farther viewing distance and better visual discrimination, allowing senior viewers to match the performance of younger viewers. These indicate the importance of smartphone display quality, especially for senior viewers and those with poorer visual abilities. avoiding excessive ambient light is also important for attenuating visual comfort...|$|E

Thus, they are a very promising energy storage system for our daily life. As {{one of the most important}} components in a battery, cathode materials have been investigated intensively in recent years as they play a key role in determining the cell voltage and discharge capacity in a battery. Both layered Li(Ni 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3 Mn 1 / 3) O 2 (NCM) and olivine-structured LiFePO 4 (LFP) materials are promising cathode candidates. However, these cathodes also have some disadvantages that have hindered further commercialization. The main issue with NCM is its rapid performance decay upon cycling. In addition, LFP is hindered by a low rate capacity and low lithium ion diffusivity. We studied the crystal growth behavior and performance of both Li(Ni 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3 Mn 1 / 3) O 2 and LiFePO 4 cathodes in order to develop synthesis-structure-function relationships. Three different crystal growth behaviors were observed for the NCM annealing process: surface, volume and grain boundary diffusion. Further exploration of the mechanism of NCM performance decay revealed that microstructural changes were related to the strain <b>accommodation</b> <b>ability</b> in this system and that nanostructured materials were more stable during cycling. In the LFP synthesis, we observed both oriented attachment (OA) and Ostwald ripening (OR) during growth in a triethylene-glycol system. Both polycrystalline and single crystalline particles evolved as a function of a time-dependent pH change. Thus, the lithium ion diffusion rate of LiFePO 4 was improved by tailoring the morphology and size though our modification of the precursor environment, revealing that polycrystalline LFP displayed better performance than single crystalline particles. Finally, the electronic conductivity of LiFePO 4 was successfully increased via a polymer solution coating method. By producing more uniform, thin and coherent coatings on LiFePO 4 particles, we were able to produce batteries with significantly less carbon (i. e., 0. 41 wt. %) while has comparable performance (discharge capacity of 80 mAh/g at 2 C) compared to traditionally synthesized carbon-coated LiFePO 4 with higher carbon loadings (ca. 2. 64 wt. %). This will enable us to produce batteries with higher active material loading and therefore, significantly larger energy densities...|$|E

40|$|Presbyopia {{has been}} a {{complicated}} problem for clinicians and researchers for centuries. Defining what constitutes presbyopia and what are its primary causes {{has long been a}} struggle for the vision and scientific community. Although presbyopia is a normal aging process of the eye, the continuous and gradual loss of accommodation is often dreaded and feared. If presbyopia were to be considered a disease, its global burden would be enormous as it affects more than a billion people worldwide. In this dissertation, I explore factors associated with presbyopia and develop a model for explaining the onset of presbyopia. In this model, the onset of presbyopia is associated primarily with three factors; depth of focus, focusing <b>ability</b> (<b>accommodation),</b> and habitual reading (or task) distance. If any of these three factors could be altered sufficiently, the onset of presbyopia could be delayed or prevented. Based on this model, I then examine possible optical methods that would be effective in correcting for presbyopia by expanding depth of focus. Two methods that have been show to be effective at expanding depth of focus include utilizing a small pupil aperture or generating higher order aberrations, particularly spherical aberration. I compare these two optical methods through the use of simulated designs, monitor testing, and visual performance metrics and then apply them in subjects through an adaptive optics system that corrects aberrations through a wavefront aberrometer and deformable mirror. I then summarize my findings and speculate about the future of presbyopia correction...|$|R

40|$|Injection molding is {{a widely}} {{employed}} manufacturing process in modern industry for mass production of plastic parts. Of the various parameters that {{affect the quality of}} injection molded products, the pressure and temperature distribution within the mold cavity are the most critical factors, as improper setting of the filling pressure or cooling speed may lead to defects such as sinks, flashes, or short shots. With increasing mold complexity and the related high cost to structurally modify the mold for sensor <b>accommodation,</b> the <b>ability</b> to integrate multiple, miniaturized sensors within the mold cavity for on- line, multi-point pressure and temperature distribution measurement while minimizing mold structure modification becomes highly attractive to the industry. ^ This thesis presented the design of a self-energized, acoustic wireless sensing methodology for the simultaneous measurement of pressure and temperature right at the mold cavity, within one sensor package. The sensor harvests energy from the pressure variation of the polymer melt during the injection molding process, and utilizes ultrasonic pulses as the carrier to wirelessly transmit pressure and temperature information through the injection mold. A significant advantage of the designed sensing method is that it avoids drilling through-holes in the injection molds or holding plates, which are costly to implement but necessary for installing traditional wired sensors, thereby allowing multiple sensors to be embedded within a complicated mold structure to improve the observability of the polymer state during the injection molding processes. ^ Research conducted in this thesis addresses four aspects of the complete solution: (1) Design of a dual-parameter modulation method suited for injection molding environment, (2) Structural optimization of the energy harvesting component, known as a piezoceramic stack, for a minimal volume of the stack while maintaining the minimum Signal-to-Noise Ratio required for reliable signal reception, (3) Design of a multi-layer ultrasound transmitter for effective transmission of the ultrasonic pulses through injection mold steel, and (4) The investigation of signal propagation within the mold cavity and the optimal localization of the receiver to obtain maximum signal strength on the back surface of the injection mold. ^ The developed sensing methodology was systematically evaluated through experiments using a sensor prototype on a Milacron T 100 injection molding machine. States of the melt at multiple locations in the mold cavity were retrieved from the sensor data to provide real- time process feedback for the machine controllers. This information will enable the development and widespread implementation of state variable control algorithms for injection molding to reduce the time required for process set-up and stabilization, and improve part quality and consistency. The energy harvesting and signal modulation mechanisms developed from this research provide a new means to power sensors for the condition monitoring and health diagnosis of dynamic systems and processes in a broad range of applications. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND People {{with disabilities}} {{have the right}} to {{personal}} mobility and available and affordable assistive technology, according to the Convention of Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Few studies have investigated overall satisfaction with prostheses fabricated using low-cost technology. Evidence-based recommendations for prosthetic and orthotic services in low-income countries are needed in order to more effectively provide services. Detailed analysis of variables which influence patient satisfaction with assistive devices are therefore of significance to investigate for improving of clinical rehabilitation practice. AIM The aims were to investigate similarities and differences between Sierra Leone and Malawi concerning participants’ mobility and satisfaction with their lower-limb prosthetic or orthotic device and related service delivery, and to identify variables associated with patients’ satisfaction with assistive devices and associated services in the entire study group from these two low-income countries. METHOD This is a cross-sectional survey study in two low-income countries with correlative and comparative design. Questionnaires, including QUEST, were answered by a total of 222 patients in Sierra Leone and Malawi. RESULTS Eighty-six per cent of assistive devices were in use, but half needed repair. One third of participants reported pain when using their assistive device. A higher percentage (66 %) of participants in Sierra Leone had difficulties or could not walk at all on uneven ground compared with 42 % in Malawi. The majority in both countries had difficulties or could not walk at all up and down hills, or on stairs. Participants in both countries were quite satisfied (mean 3. 7 – 3. 9 of 5) with their assistive device. Participants were most dissatisfied with: comfort (46 %), dimensions (39 %), and safety (38 %) of their assistive device. In Sierra Leone participants were less satisfied than in Malawi with service delivery (mean 3. 7; 4. 4, p<. 001). Access to repairs and servicing of their assistive device was considered the most important item. In Sierra Leone patients were less satisfied with follow-up services (41 %) than patients in Malawi were (22 %). The significant association with satisfaction with assistive device was pain, general condition of the device, ability to walk on uneven ground/roads, ability to walk on stairs, and ability {{to get in and out}} of a car. The significant association with satisfaction with service was general condition of the device, ability to walk on uneven ground, ability to pay for costs associated with receiving the service appliances, <b>accommodation,</b> travel, and <b>ability</b> to walk on stairs. DISCUSSION Implications of the results is that the design and manufacture of prostheses and orthoses using low-cost technology needs be improved, specifically towards appropriate dimensions, increased comfort, and increasing the ability of patients to ambulate on challenging surfaces with their assistive device, as well as increasing patients’ ability to walk long distances with reduced pain. Increased or simulated ankle joint range of motion, careful dynamic alignment, more optimal dimensioning of assistive devices, and better training could facilitate the desired improvements. Access to repairs and follow-up services were important to participants, and should be addressed both by professionals operating within the rehabilitation field and policymakers, as it has the potential to improve mobility and satisfaction levels as well as reduce pain. The quality of assistive devices and service delivery could be enhanced by addressing the education level of staff. CONCLUSION Participants reported high levels of use and mobility with their assistive device, in spite of pain and difficulties walking on uneven ground, which were also associated with the level of satisfaction with the assistive device. More than half of the assistive devices were in need of repair. Access to repairs and follow-up services were the most important to patients, and should be addressed. Country was associated with satisfaction with service, with participants in Sierra Leone significantly less satisfied. REFERENCES Magnusson L, Ahlström G.

40|$|Down {{syndrome}} (DS) is {{the most}} common genetic cause of mental challenge in individuals and is associated with many ocular disorders. One of these anomalies which is frequently present in this population is reduced accommodation and many studies have reported this. <b>Accommodation</b> is the <b>ability</b> of the crystalline lens in the eye to focus for objects at different distances. Prescribing bifocals could potentially help in correcting the resultant inaccurate focus, although this modality of treatment is not very commonly practiced. The impact of bifocals on reading and literacy skills (academic skills) as well as visual-perceptual skills in individuals with DS has not been studied previously. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the impact of bifocals on the educational attainment of children and young adults with DS who have reduced accommodation and monitor their performance longitudinally. This is the first time that the impact of bifocal provision on the functional performance of children and young adults with DS has been studied. Also for the first time in children with DS, frequent measures of performance have been used to control for progression with time before and after bifocal prescription. A battery of tests comprising early literacy and visual-perceptual skills was administered before and after bifocal prescription. Accommodation and printing skills were also measured periodically. It was expected that the prescription of bifocals would help to improve near visual acuity and that the improved near acuity would result in educational achievements at school. Compliance with spectacle wear and school reports were also considered. A longitudinal observational study design was utilized with each child acting as his/her own control. Fourteen children and teenagers aged 8 - 18 with DS were recruited and underwent a basic optometric exam including measurement of their accommodative ability and a cycloplegic refraction. Seventy nine percent required a change in their spectacle prescription and were prescribed single vision (SV) lenses. One hundred percent had reduced accommodation both before and after new SV glasses were prescribed. Distance visual acuity did not significantly improve with SV lenses (p> 0. 05) but near visual acuity showed a significant improvement (p-= 0. 015) from 0. 64 ± 0. 25 logMAR to 0. 54 ± 0. 20 logMAR. A high prevalence of high refractive errors, including both hyperopia and myopia, was observed t andnear visual acuity even with a habitual correctionwas reduced compared to distance VA. A full battery of reading and visual-perceptual tests was administered with SV lenses. Thereafter the participants were followed for 6 months and monthly subtests (probes) of literacy skills and printing tasks were administered. These “probes” acted as immediate indicators of the child’s performance with his/her correction and change in performance over this time period was monitored. Over the 6 months the participants showed no noteworthy progression in their literacy skills. The group of participants performed at an age-equivalent between 3 - 10 years. The quality of printing formation in this population has been studied for the first time and showed no significant change over time. It was observed that some aspects of visual-perceptual and early literacy skills could be measured in all the participants. Chronological age and receptive vocabulary were significantly correlated with visual motor integration and Word Identification. Eighty five percent of the participants were prescribed bifocals with additions ranging from + 1. 00 D to + 3. 50 D at the 6 th month after the provision of SV lenses. Post-bifocal measures of visual acuity, accommodation, visual-perceptual and early literacy skills were taken 1 - 2 weeks, and finally 5 months, after bifocal correction. Throughout the pre- and post-bifocal period, verbal compliance with spectacle wear was assessed through school and parental reports. The mean near logMAR VA improved with bifocals (p= 0. 007) compared to SV lenses. Accommodative accuracy improved with bifocals (less accommodative lag) compared to SV lenses (p= 0. 002) but there was no change in the accommodation exerted through the distance portion of the lens compared to SV lenses (p= 0. 423). There was a main effect of bifocals on sight words (p= 0. 013), Word Identification (p= 0. 047), and 2 out of 3 tests of visual perception (p< 0. 05). It was observed that bifocals have a positive impact on the children’s visual and school performance and this was supported by reports of improved performance in school for nine out of eleven individuals who were prescribed bifocals. The children adapted to bifocals more readily than the SV glasses, wearing them for the majority of their waking time. All the sessions of early literacy and visual-perceptual skills administered throughout the duration of the study were videotaped and were then analyzed by a naïve examiner. The time taken to perform each task was calculated and compared between the main single vision and bifocal visits. There was a significant decrease in the completion times on the test battery with bifocals for Word Identification (p= 0. 0015) and the Dolch sight words (p= 0. 048). All participants who completed the monthly probes took less time to complete the Dolch sight words (p= 0. 025) and the number writing task (p= 0. 001) with bifocals. Similar results were not observed for the visual-perceptual tests. Performance in the monthly probes was compared before and after bifocal prescription in terms of the average raw scores and time taken. The rate of improvement in performance with bifocals was calculated by plotting the test scores against time and determing the regression lines. There was an overall significant improvement in the monthly probe scores of Word Identification (p= 0. 050), Dolch sight words (p= 0. 025) and the number test (p= 0. 023) with bifocals. The rate of progression in scores increased with bifocals for the Word Identification (p= 0. 008). Evidence of improved and faster performance with bifocals on some literacy skills was seen. It was concluded that bifocals, which result in improved near focusing, help individuals with DS to maximize their educational potential. It is suggested that more children and teenagers with DS will benefit from bifocal prescription, as they were observed to improve near visual acuity and enable better focusing for near. This thesis has provided a comprehensive analysis of the some tests of literacy, visual- perceptual and early printing skills before and after a bifocal prescription in a group of children and teenagers with Down syndrome. This is the first study to longitudinally monitor the educational impact of bifocals in a population with Down syndrome. Furthermore, the quality of printing formation in this population is a previously unstudied area and was studied longitudinally prior to and after bifocal intervention. The impact of bifocals on printing skills is also discussed. Another novel approach was that all the literacy, writing and visual-perceptual tasks sessions were videotaped to calculate the time taken to complete each task pre- and post-bifocals. This thesis is an addition to the existing literature on bifocal prescription in Down syndrome populations. From the findings in this thesis, the following recommendations are made in order to improve the standard of clinical eye care in this population. Measurement of accommodation should be considered a routine test in the clinical ocular examination for young individuals with DS, now that it is known that many of them present with accommodative deficits. When accommodation is found to be reduced, prescription of bifocals is indicated and should also become the standard of care in this population...|$|R
