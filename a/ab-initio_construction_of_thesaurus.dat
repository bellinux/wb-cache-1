40|$|Thesauruses {{are useful}} {{resources}} for NLP; however, manual <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>thesaurus</b> is time consuming and suffers low coverage. Automatic thesaurus construction is developed {{to solve the}} problem. Conventional way to automatically construct thesaurus is by finding similar words based on context vector models and then organizing similar words into thesaurus structure. But the context vector methods suffer from the problems of vast feature dimensions and data sparseness. Latent Semantic Index (LSI) was commonly used to overcome the problems. In this paper, we propose a feature clustering method to overcome the same problems. The experimental results show that it performs better than the LSI models and do enhance contextual information for infrequent words. ...|$|R

We also propose a new re- duction procedure where the derived equations are used to decide which scheme should be employed for each feature group on the given feature hier- archy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments using HTTP access logs and also a collection of full-text aca- demic articles. 1 Introduction Frequency matrices are common data representa- tions in information systems which {{can be viewed as}} a special type of contingency tables whose cell (i; j) represents the number of occurrences of event j with object i. For this type of data, dual scaling analysis (DSA) [1]is known to provide an effective way to explore the underlying association structure among rows and among columns. DSA is a statistical analysis method which adopts a mathematical technique called the sin- gular value decomposition (SVD). In recent years, the usefulness of DSA or other SVD-based method- s was demonstrated in various application domains including automatic <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>thesaurus</b> [2], automatic indexing in information retrieval sys- tems [3] or concept space visualization [4].

40|$|Purpose - With {{the growing}} {{recognition}} that thesauri aid information retrieval, organisations {{are beginning to}} adopt, and in many cases, create thesauri. This paper offers some guidance on the construction process. Design/methodology/approach - An opinion piece with a practical focus, based on recent experiences gleaned from consultancy work. Findings - A number of steps {{can be taken to}} ensure any thesaurus under construction is fit for purpose. Due consideration is therefore given to aspects such as term selection, structure and notation, thesauri standards, software and Web display issues, thesauri evaluation and maintenance. This paper also notes that creating new subject schemes from scratch, however attractive, contributes to the plethora of terminologies currently in existence and can limit user searching within particular contexts. The decision to create a "new" thesaurus should therefore be taken carefully and observance of standards is paramount.

When θ exceeds a certain value, the daily usage frequency of most words in the gender-specific thesaurus will decrease. When the words in the thesaurus are not words that people use frequently every day, the classifier will have difficulty capturing the gender features contained in the text, so the classification effect based on the thesaurus will begin to decrease.

40|$|International audienceResearch on {{the various}} {{components}} of biodiversity has and will produce large quantities of heterogeneous and distributed data {{that need to be}} integrated and characterized in a unified way to reveal their full potential. Over the last thirty years the trait-based, functional approach to biodiversity has undergone an extraordinary expansion and has been key to advances in many fields of natural science. To represent, exploit and share the tremendous amount of data the biodiversity community has to acquire data standards, which should reflect the perception of this community. A first step toward this goal is to define the set of concepts that form the basis of this particular domain of knowledge, thereby developing a thesaurus for plant functional diversity research. Such concepts can be represented by a controlled list of preferred terms that are identified by the thesaurus' developers. Such a thesaurus will serve as a stable reference of standards for integration purposes, specifically when published in RDF language, a Semantic Web standard, and in addition available as linked data on the web.
