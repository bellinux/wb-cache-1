5|$|In 1913, {{writing on}} his own, Hesketh-Prichard created the crime-fighting figure November Joe, <b>a</b> <b>hunter</b> and backwoodsman from the Canadian wilderness. It was {{broadcast}} as a radio {{play by the}} BBC on 23 September 1970.|$|E
5|$|O'Flaherty {{interprets the}} myth of Prithu—his {{transformation}} from <b>a</b> <b>hunter</b> who chased the earth-cow to the herdsman-farmer—as a transition in Vedic or Hindu people from eating beef to having cow's milk and cultivated vegetables and grain instead of beef. David Shulman compares Prithu with the Vedic deity Rudra-Shiva. Prithu, like Rudra, is an ideal king, but with a violent side. Prithu's actions of chasing the earth-cow as <b>a</b> <b>hunter</b> and finally milking her, display this terrifying side of the king. Both, Prithu and Rudra, are closely associated with sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two main}} issues {{concerning}} the locomotory abilities of Tyrannosaurus: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been. Both {{are relevant to the}} debate about whether it was <b>a</b> <b>hunter</b> or a scavenger.|$|E
5|$|A {{traditional}} {{game called}} kitsune-ken (fox-fist) references the kitsune's powers over human beings. The game {{is similar to}} rock, paper, scissors, but the three hand positions signify a fox, <b>a</b> <b>hunter,</b> and a village headman. The headman beats the hunter, whom he outranks; the hunter beats the fox, whom he shoots; the fox beats the headman, whom he bewitches.|$|E
50|$|Example: <b>Hunter</b> <b>A</b> attacks <b>Hunter</b> B. <b>Hunter</b> <b>A</b> has 3 {{attack and}} 0 defense, Hunter B has 1 attack and 2 defense. Hunter B chooses to counterattack {{and uses a}} +5 yellow Defense modifier. <b>Hunter</b> <b>A</b> chooses to use a +3 red Attack modifier. The system then rolls a 6 and <b>a</b> 5 for <b>Hunter</b> <b>A,</b> and a 4 and <b>a</b> 4 for <b>Hunter</b> B. <b>Hunter</b> <b>A's</b> attack is 6+5 +3 bonus +3 = 17. Hunter B's defense is 4+4 +5 bonus +2 = 15. Hunter B will take 2 damage. The system will then {{calculate}} Hunter B's counter-attack in a similar fashion.|$|R

5|$|Across {{the texts}} of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to {{non-human}} life, but without a universal consensus. Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa. In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, <b>a</b> <b>hunter</b> defends his profession in a long discourse.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, the {{assumption}} of the subspecies' extinction was challenged when <b>a</b> <b>hunter</b> shot an adult female, proving the species had somehow survived the war.

With six of his friends, armed with guns, Mike ventures into the forest to hunt the shark. The shark kills each person except for Mike. Following this, Chapman, Lincoln, Wendy, and Cameron {{make their way into}} the woods, armed with a miniature crossbow, a shotgun, and a motion-sensing camera. They set up the camera on a tree and depart. At the town bar, Professor Hoffman enters, having gone into hiding and now wearing an eyepatch. Later, he and a grieving Mike drink beers.|$|E

5|$|Due to its graphic content, Ultime grida dalla savana has {{encountered}} censorship issues with certain countries' film boards. In Australia, the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) banned both an uncut and cut {{version of the}} film in 1976. An appeal filed later that year was denied. Ten years later, the home video distributor Palace Video brought the same cut print before the film board and it received an R18+ rating. The cuts include segments from the lion attack, the torture and murder of the indigenous man by mercenaries, {{the death of a}} fox by a pack of hounds, and the death of a stag by <b>a</b> <b>hunter</b> in the opening scene.|$|E

The tail-piece for Sabine's snipe, a gamebird, shows <b>a</b> <b>hunter</b> firing, and a small bird falling to the ground. There is no exclusion of human life from the images: one tail-piece depicts a works complete with smoking chimney beside a river.|$|E

5|$|HMS Levant was a 28-gun sixth-rate frigate of the , {{which saw}} Royal Navy service against France in the Seven Years' War, and against France, Spain and the American colonies during the American Revolutionary War. Principally <b>a</b> <b>hunter</b> of privateers, {{she was also}} {{designed}} to be a match for small French frigates, but with a broader hull and sturdier build at the expense of some speed and manoeuvrability. Launched in 1758, Levant was assigned to the Royal Navy's Jamaica station from 1759 and proved her worth in defeating nine French vessels during her first three years at sea. She was also part of the British expedition against Martinique in 1762 but played no role in the landings or subsequent defeat of French forces at Fort Royal.|$|E
