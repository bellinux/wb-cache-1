5|$|With this tour, I'm {{going to}} be working on some {{different}} arrangements for some of the older songs, to... give it a little more life to them. That's not to say they're going to sound totally different and to freak anybody out... I love re-singing songs to different music. I genuinely want to tour with these new songs, as well as older hits. These new songs mean so much to me, this time of my life has been so wonderful for me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to experience that with my fans.|$|E
25|$|I {{think we}} have a way in, making it visual and making it funny. I want it to be really funny and entertaining, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> you to not realize how much {{information}} is being thrown at you because you're having fun. We've found a couple of ideas on how to bust the form a bit, in order for all that information to reach you in a way that's a little oblique.|$|E
25|$|When Qabbani was 15, his sister, who was 25 at the time, {{committed}} suicide because {{she refused to}} marry a man she did not love. During her funeral he decided to fight the social conditions he saw as causing her death. When asked whether he was a revolutionary, the poet answered: “Love in the Arab world is like a prisoner, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to set (it) free. I want to free the Arab soul, sense and body with my poetry. The relationships {{between men and women}} in our society are not healthy.” He is {{known as one of the}} most feminist and progressive intellectuals of his time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{coaches were}} calling the house, telling my dad to ‘talk to her.’ And {{part of it}} was the drugs, {{part of it was}} I'd done it so long. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be a teenager. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do stuff on {{weekends}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> not to have to practice at 5 in the morning <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>want</b> to have to run 3 miles every other day.|$|R

25|$|In {{his recent}} book 'Back to the Mark' the fast bowler had written 'I try to hit a batsman in the rib-cage when I bowl a {{purposeful}} bouncer <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> it to hurt {{so much that the}} batsman doesn't want to face me any more'. How well he had succeeded in Edrich's case! The irony of his pyrrhic victory was that Edrich had not been felled by a bouncer...The English press greeted the incident with headlines such as: 'Licence to Kill!', 'Lillee should be banned' – '007, James Bond cricket'. The atmosphere {{on and off the field}} was emotionally electric. Bodyline was freely discussed. In the background the crowd, lusting for more blood and guts, stirred the embers of controversy chanting for 'Lillee, Lillee'.|$|E

500|$|... "When I wrote American Life, I {{was very}} {{agitated}} {{by what was}} going on in the world around me, [...] I was angry. I had a lot to get off my chest. I made a lot of political statements. But now, I feel that I just want to have fun; I want to dance; I want to feel buoyant. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to give other people the same feeling. There's a lot of madness in the world around us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> people to be happy." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{wrote the}} first verse and Roger helped me with the rest. I was {{inspired}} by listening to Charlie Parker, feeling that this was really a free spirit, and whatever he'd done with drugs and booze and everything else, that his playing released him and freed his spirit, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> us to be like that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to write a song about that, a spiritual song.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{he was the}} dearest donkey in the world! <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to h--shake {{hands with}} him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to kiss--yes, kiss!--her, {{she was such a}} lovable fool." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to {{come tonight}} because I'm going away next week, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to see how he'd act at a {{surprise}} party again," [...] Rose explained.|$|R
500|$|Ishii was {{inspired}} to write a film with an international cast after watching a South Korean dramatization of the war. He wanted the film to be an [...] "entertaining action film", but also said he was [...] "very interested in depicting MacArthur {{as a human being}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> the world to know how miserable the war was for the Korean people." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{extensive}} redecoration {{was paid}} for by private donations. Many significant and long-lasting changes occurred {{as a result of}} the renovation and refurbishment, of which Reagan said, [...] "This house belongs to all Americans, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> it to be something of which they can be proud." [...] The renovations received some criticisms for being funded by tax-deductible donations, meaning some of it eventually did indirectly come from the tax-paying public.|$|E
500|$|In 1994, {{the three}} films were {{released}} as the VHS tape Meat Loaf – Bat Out of Hell 2 – Picture Show, which also included alternate versions of [...] "Paradise by the Dashboard Light", [...] "Life Is a Lemon <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> My Money Back" [...] and [...] "I'd Do Anything for Love", all featuring lead vocalist Patti Russo. They were included on a DVD in 2006 with the 'Collectors Edition' {{release of the}} album.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was mad," [...] he continued. [...] "I saw {{the notes}} {{and they went}} to my head. Men do wild things {{sometimes}} when they are drunk, or for love. I don't drink much, and I'm not over fond of women, but, my God, money is like the blood of my body to me! <b>I</b> saw it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> went mad! Zoe, you won't give me away? Say you won't!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to," [...] {{answered}} Kiki. [...] "You {{acted as}} if I was your slave, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to show these forest people that I am more powerful than you." ...|$|R

500|$|Rundgren {{points out}} that [...] "the themes of the songs were darker." [...] The second track, [...] "Life is a Lemon <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> My Money Back", {{demonstrates}} this pessimism. Several things are identified as [...] "defective", including love, sex, gods, childhood and the future. AllMusic labels it [...] "a stomping rocker that wraps serious feelings in a cryptically witty metaphor." [...] Despite the pessimism, both AllMusic and Meat Loaf point out that [...] "it is a funny song." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{said of her}} {{decision}} to finish the show, [...] "I love television, {{and if it was}} possible for me to work in it more, then I would; but because of the position I've put myself in of being the only writer on the show, I can't physically work in it that often. I've just had it with sketch shows for a bit – people have liked it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to stop while they still like it." ...|$|E
500|$|Angel is a {{long-haired}} blond youth {{inspired by}} Billy the Kid. He is a skilled gunfighter, and possesses a fiery temper. Nicknamed 'the fire-eatin', lead-throwin' angel', when first meeting Clay Duncan, he presents himself thus: [...] "Got not peeve! I live alone... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{to be left}} alone! I ain't like other kids! They got mothers and fathers to fuss over 'em! Well, I don't need nobody! Nobody! I kin handle myself against any man!" [...] His horse's name is Paint.|$|E
5000|$|... "I didn't {{want to work}} {{on walls}} or on the floor <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to use street lamps as an urban gallery <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to use the {{darkness}} as the setting around my artwork." ...|$|R
5000|$|As Savchenkov himself explains, 'many {{people find}} {{suburban}} landscapes sterile <b>and</b> anonymous, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to disprove that. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to show that}} every housing block and every vacant lot contain certain histories and memories.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm all right, boys," [...] he declared. [...] "I couldn't find a cab--had to walk {{further than}} <b>I</b> meant, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> a drink badly. Wrayson, come over here. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{to talk to}} you." ...|$|R
500|$|These {{concepts}} {{shaped the}} Mercury Control Center, which was located at Cape Canaveral in Florida. Another important concept pioneered by Kraft {{was the idea}} of the flight director, the man who would coordinate the team of engineers and make real-time decisions about the conduct of the mission. As Mathews later recalled, Kraft came to him one day saying, [...] "There needs to be someone in charge of the flights while they're actually going on, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to be that person." [...] In this informal way, the position of flight director was born.|$|E
500|$|When a {{civil war}} seemed unavoidable, Ellsworth {{proceeded}} to New York City to recruit his own regiment from the city's volunteer fire companies, stating: [...] "I want the New York Firemen, for {{there are no more}} effective men in the country, and none with whom I can do so much. They are sleeping on a volcano at Washington <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> men who can go into a fight now." [...] Two days after his arrival, Ellsworth awarded officer commissions to several foremen of the volunteer fire companies and began recruiting in earnest.|$|E
500|$|With reports speculating that Costa {{wanting to}} leave Chelsea, Costa affirmed on 2 June 2015 after Chelsea's post-season tour {{that he had}} no desire to leave London, saying, [...] "It's always a bit more {{difficult}} in the first season for adaptation, but I have no reason to leave this place, I love it, the fans love me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to stay. It’s really good to come in the first season [...] and win two things [...] Next year I’ll be ready to come back and, hopefully, win a couple more trophies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{is a true}} revelation, {{as far as it}} goes; {{but there}} is {{something}} more. I have received this letter, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to say--something.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why do you {{not follow}} their example?" [...] I asked jocosely, for this young woman puzzled me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to find out about}} her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; Mrs. Luna, in New York, told me {{you were}} {{sometimes}} here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted,</b> at any rate, to make the attempt to find you." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{recording}} {{began on}} August 21, 1977 and {{took place in}} Midtown Manhattan at Media Sound Studios, a premises of a former Episcopalian Church. On {{the first day of}} sessions, guitarist Johnny Ramone brought a copy of the Sex Pistols' single [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] with him, remarking that their type of music [...] "robbed" [...] the band. He emphasized that the album's sound engineer Ed Stasium needed to incorporate better production than that of the Sex Pistols, to which Stasium replied [...] "no problem". Johnny relates: [...] "These guys ripped us off <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to sound better than this." ...|$|E
500|$|Myers {{obtained}} the coaching job at his alma mater, Centre College, and brought all the above-named players with him. McMillin and Weaver {{did not have}} sufficient high-school credits to enter college and enrolled at Somerset High School for the 1916-17 year, playing with Red Roberts. [...] "I've got a boy under my wing down here in Texas who's a football-playing fool <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{him to go to}} Centre. I'd like for you to get him in a high school up there, and away from his pool-playing pals in Texas." [...] wrote Myers to a man in Somerset.|$|E
500|$|On 18 April 2016, an {{official}} statement was released, cancelling {{the last leg}} of the RoXXXette 30th Anniversary Tour due to concerns about Marie Fredriksson's health. As her doctors have advised her to refrain from playing live, there will be no further Roxette tours. Fredriksson stated: [...] "Sadly, now my touring days are over <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to take this opportunity to thank our wonderful fans that has followed us on our long and winding journey."
