I rose to my feet, stared at him for some seconds in utter amazement, and then it appears that I must have fainted for the first and the last time in my life. Certainly a gray mist swirled before my eyes, and when it cleared I found my collar-ends undone and the tingling <b>after-taste</b> of brandy upon my lips. Holmes was bending over my chair, his flask in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|I didn't, for two reasons, {{answer your}} {{delightful}} letter, or rather exquisite note, from the Sydney Club, but I must {{thank you for}} it now, before the gulfs have washed you down, or at least have washed away from you all <b>after-tastes</b> of brineless things--the stay-at-home works of lubberly friends. One of the reasons just mentioned was that I had written to you at Sydney (c/o the mystic Towns,) {{only a few days}} before your note arrived; the other is that until a few days ago I hugged the soft illusion that by the time anything else would reach you, you would already have started for England. This fondest of hopes of all of us has been shattered in a manner to which history furnishes a parallel only in the behaviour of its most famous coquettes and courtesans. You are indeed the male Cleopatra or buccaneering Pompadour of the Deep--the wandering Wanton of the Pacific. You swim into our ken with every provocation and prospect--and we have only time to open our arms to receive you when your immortal back is turned to us in the act of still more provoking flight. The moral {{is that we have to}} be virtuous whether we like it or no. Seriously, it was a real heart-break to have September substituted for June; but I have a general faith in the fascinated providence who watches over you, to the neglect of all other human affairs--I believe that even He has an idea that you know what you are about, and even what He is, though He by this time doesn't in the least know himself. Moreover I have selfish grounds of resignation in the fact that I shall be in England in September, whereas, to my almost intolerable torment, I should probably not have been in June. Therefore when you come, if you ever do, which in my heart of hearts I doubt, I shall see you in all your strange exotic bloom, in all your paint and beads and feathers. May you grow a magnificent extra crop of all such things (as they will bring you a fortune here,) in this much grudged extra summer. Charming and delightful to me to see you with a palate for my plain domestic pudding, after all the wild cannibal smacks that you have learned to know. I think the better of the poor little study in the painfully-familiar, since hearing that it could bear such voyages and resist such tests. You have fed a presumption that vaguely stirs within me--that of trying to get at you in June or July with a fearfully long-winded but very highly-finished novel which I am putting forth in (probably) the last days of May. If I were sure it would overtake you on some coral strand I shouldn't hesitate; for, seriously and selfishly speaking, I can't (spiritually) afford not to put the book under the eye of the sole and single Anglo-saxon capable of perceiving--though he may care for little else in it--how well it is written. So I shall probably cast it upon the waters and pray for it; as I suppose you are coming back to Sydney, it may meet you there, and you can read it on the voyage home. In that box you'll have to. I don't say it to bribe you in advance to unnatural tolerance--but I have an impression that I didn't make copious or clear to you in my last what a grand literary life your Master of B. has been leading here. Somehow, a miracle has been wrought for you (for you they are,) and the fine old feather-bed of English taste has thrilled with preternatural recognitions. The most unlikely number of people have discerned that the Master is [...] "well written." [...] It has had the highest success of honour that the English-reading public can now confer; where it has failed (the success, save that it hasn't failed at all!) it has done so through the constitutional incapacity of the umpire--infected, by vulgar intercourses, as with some unnameable disease. We have lost our status--nous n'avons plus qualité--to confer degrees. Nevertheless, last year you woke us up at night, for an hour--and we scrambled down in our shirt and climbed a garden-wall and stole a laurel, which we have been brandishing ever since over your absent head. I tell you this because I think Colvin (at least it was probably he--he is visibly better--or else Mrs. Sitwell) mentioned to me the other day that you had asked in touching virginal ignorance for news of the fate of the book. Its [...] "fate," [...] my dear fellow, has been glittering glory--simply: and I ween--that is I hope--you will find the glitter has chinked as well. I sent you a new Zola the other day--at a venture: but I have no confidence that I gratified a curiosity. I haven't read The Human Beast--one knows him without that--and I am told Zola's account of him is dull and imperfect. I would read anything new about him--but this is old, old, old. I hope your pen, this summer, will cleave the deeps of art even as your prow, or your keel, or whatever's the knowing name for it, furrows the Pacific flood. Into what strange and wondrous dyes you must be now qualified to dip it! Roast yourself, I beseech you, on the sharp spit of perfection, that you may give out your aromas and essences! Tell your wife, please, to read between the lines of this, and between the words and the letters, all that I miss the occasion to write directly to her. I hope she has continued to distil, to your mother, the honey of those impressions of which a few months ago the latter lent me for a day or two a taste--on its long yellow foolscap combs. They would make, they will make, of course, a deliciously sweet book. I hope Lloyd, whom I greet and bless, is living up to the height of his young privilege--and secreting honey too, according to the mild discipline of the hive. There are lots of things more to tell you, no doubt, but if I go on they will all take the shape of questions, and that won't be fair. The supreme thing to say is Don't, oh don't, simply ruin our nerves and our tempers for the rest of life by not throwing the rope in September, to him who will, for once in his life, not muff his catch: ...|$|R
60|$|In {{regard to}} their religion, nations, like individuals, seem {{singularly}} averse to practising what they have preached. Whether it be that his self-constructed idols prove to the maker too suggestive of his own intellectual chisel to deceive him for long, or whether sacred soil, like less hallowed ground, becomes after a time incapable of responding to repeated sowings of the same seed, certain it is that in spiritual matters most peoples have grown out of conceit with their own conceptions. An individual may cling with a certain sentiment to the religion of his mother, but nations have shown anything but a foolish fondness for the sacred superstitions of their great-grandfathers. To the charm of creation succeeds invariably the bitter-sweet <b>after-taste</b> of criticism, and man {{would not be the}} progressive animal he is if he long remained in love with his own productions.|$|E
60|$|Willems never {{remembered how}} and when he parted from Aissa. He caught himself {{drinking}} the muddy {{water out of the}} hollow of his hand, while his canoe was drifting in mid-stream past the last houses of Sambir. With his returning wits came the fear of something unknown that had taken possession of his heart, of something inarticulate and masterful which could not speak and would be obeyed. His first impulse was that of revolt. He would never go back there. Never! He looked round slowly at the brilliance of things in the deadly sunshine and took up his paddle! How changed everything seemed! The river was broader, the sky was higher. How fast the canoe flew under the strokes of his paddle! Since when had he acquired the strength of two men or more? He {{looked up and down the}} reach at the forests of the bank with a confused notion that with one sweep of his hand he could tumble all these trees into the stream. His face felt burning. He drank again, and shuddered with a depraved sense of pleasure at the <b>after-taste</b> of slime in the water.|$|E
60|$|I {{went back}} to the old gate which led to the bridge. Close by, in the little place, was the hut of the consumo, the local custom-house, with {{officials}} lounging at the door or sitting straddle-legged on chairs, lazily smoking. Opposite was a tobacconist's, with the gaudy red and yellow sign, Campañia arrendataria de tabacos, and a dram-shop where three hardy Spaniards from the mountains stood drinking aguardiente. Than this, by the way, there is in the world no more insidious liquor, for at first you think its taste of aniseed and peppermint very disagreeable; but perseverance, here as in other human affairs, has its reward, and presently you develop for it a liking which time increases to enthusiasm. In Spain, the land of custom and usage, everything is done in a certain way; and there is a proper manner to drink aguardiente. To sip it would show a lamentable want of decorum. A Spaniard lifts the little glass to his lips, and with a comic, abrupt motion tosses the contents into his mouth, immediately afterwards drinking water, a tumbler of which is always given with the spirit. It is really the most epicurean of intoxicants because the charm lies in the <b>after-taste.</b> The water is so cool and refreshing after the fieriness; it gives, without the gasconnade, the emotion Keats experienced when he peppered his mouth with cayenne for the greater enjoyment of iced claret.|$|E
60|$|But {{he had no}} more frivolity to {{complain}} of. We finished our stage {{and came to the}} inn-door with decorum, to find the house still alight and in a bustle with many late arrivals; to give our orders with a prompt severity which ensured obedience, and to be served soon after at a side-table, close to the fire and in a blaze of candle-light, with such a meal as I had been dreaming of for days past. For days, you are to remember, I had been skulking in the covered cart, a prey to cold, hunger, and an accumulation of discomforts that might have daunted the most brave; and the white table napery, the bright crystal, the reverberation of the fire, the red curtains, the Turkey carpet, the portraits on the coffee-room wall, the placid faces of the two or three late guests who were silently prolonging the pleasures of digestion, and (last, but not by any means least) a glass of an excellent light dry port, put me in a humour only to be described as heavenly. The thought of the Colonel, of how he would have enjoyed this snug room and roaring fire, and of his cold grave in the wood by Market Bosworth, lingered on my palate, amari aliquid, like an <b>after-taste,</b> but was not able--I say it with shame--entirely to dispel my self-complacency. After all, in this world every dog hangs by its own tail. I was a free adventurer, who had just brought to a successful end--or, at least, within view of it--an adventure very difficult and alarming; and I looked across at Mr. Dudgeon, as the port rose to his cheeks, and a smile, that was semi-confidential and a trifle foolish, began to play upon his leathery features, not only with composure, but with a suspicion of kindness. The rascal had been brave, a quality for which I would value the devil; and if he had been pertinacious in the beginning, he had more than made up for it before the end.|$|E
60|$|And he {{told her}} of a whole world, or rather of several intermingled worlds, set apart in this sleepy hollow in the hills, of beast lore and wood lore and farm craft, at times {{touching}} almost the border of witchcraft--passing lightly here, not with the probing eagerness of those who know nothing, but with the averted glance of those who fear to see too much. He told her {{of those things that}} slept and those that prowled when the dusk fell, of strange hunting cats, of the yard swine and the stalled cattle, of the farm folk themselves, as curious and remote in their way, in their ideas and fears and wants and tragedies, as the brutes and feathered stock that they tended. It seemed to Elaine as if a musty store of old-world children's books had been fetched down from some cobwebbed lumber- room and brought to life. Sitting there in the little paddock, grown thickly with tall weeds and rank grasses, and shadowed by the weather-beaten old grey barn, listening to this chronicle of wonderful things, half fanciful, half very real, she could scarcely believe that a few miles away there was a garden-party in full swing, with smart frocks and smart conversation, fashionable refreshments and fashionable music, and a fevered undercurrent of social strivings and snubbings. Did Vienna and the Balkan Mountains and the Black Sea seem as remote and hard to believe in, she wondered, to the man sitting by her side, who had discovered or invented this wonderful fairyland? Was it a true and merciful arrangement of fate and life that the things of the moment thrust out the <b>after-taste</b> of the things that had been? Here was one who had held much that was priceless in the hollow of his hand and lost it all, and he was happy and absorbed and well-content with the little wayside corner of the world into which he had crept. And Elaine, who held so many desirable things in the hollow of her hand, could not make up her mind to be even moderately happy. She did not even know whether to take this hero of her childhood down from his pedestal, or to place him on a higher one; on the whole she was inclined to resent rather than approve the idea that ill- health and misfortune could so completely subdue and tame an erstwhile bold and roving spirit.|$|E
60|$|A {{part of the}} mountain-top is {{occupied}} by the church of St. Margaret, and this was St. Margaret's day. The houses pause roundabout it and leave a grassy slope, planted here and there with lean black cypresses. The contadini from near and far had congregated in force and were crowding into the church or winding up the slope. When I arrived they were all kneeling or uncovered; a bedizened procession, with banners and censers, bearing abroad, I believe, the relics of the saint, was re-entering the church. The scene made one of those pictures that Italy still brushes in for you with an incomparable hand and from an inexhaustible palette when you find her in the mood. The day was superb--the sky blazed overhead like a vault of deepest sapphire. The grave brown peasantry, with no great accent of costume, but with sundry small ones--decked, that is, in cheap fineries of scarlet and yellow--made a mass of motley colour in the high wind-stirred light. The procession halted in the pious hush, and the lovely land around and beneath us melted away, almost to either sea, in tones of azure scarcely less intense than the sky. Behind the church was an empty crumbling citadel, with half-a-dozen old women keeping the gate for coppers. Here were views and breezes and sun and shade and grassy corners to the heart's content, together with one could n't say what huge seated mystic melancholy presence, the <b>after-taste</b> of everything the still open maw of time had consumed. I chose a spot that fairly combined all these advantages, a spot from which I seemed to look, as who should say, straight down the throat of the monster, no dark passage now, {{but with all the}} glorious day playing into it, and spent a good part of my stay at Cortona lying there at my length and observing the situation over the top of a volume that I must have brought in my pocket just for that especial wanton luxury of the resource provided and slighted. In the afternoon I came down and hustled a while through the crowded little streets, and then strolled forth under the scorching sun and made the outer circuit of the wall. There I found tremendous uncemented blocks; they glared and twinkled in the powerful light, and I had to put on a blue eye-glass in order to throw into its proper perspective the vague Etruscan past, obtruded and magnified in such masses quite as with the effect of inadequately-withdrawn hands and feet in photographs.|$|E
60|$|But that {{proposition}} holds true, after all, {{for almost}} any mild pastime of the incurable student of loose meanings and stray relics and odd references and dim analogies in an Italian hill- city bronzed and seasoned by the ages. I ought perhaps, for justification {{of the right}} to talk, to have plunged into the Siena archives of which, on one occasion, a kindly custodian gave me, in rather dusty and stuffy conditions, as the incident vaguely comes back to me, a glimpse that was like a moment's stand at the mouth of a deep, dark mine. I didn't descend into the pit; I did, instead of this, a much idler and easier thing: I simply went every afternoon, my stint of work over, I like to recall, for a musing stroll upon the Lizza--the Lizza which had its own unpretentious but quite insidious art of meeting the lover of old stories halfway. The great and subtle thing, if you are not a strenuous specialist, in places of a heavily charged historic consciousness, is to profit by the sense of that consciousness--or in other words to cultivate a relation with the oracle--after the fashion that suits yourself; so that if the general <b>after-taste</b> of experience, experience at large, the fine distilled essence of the matter, seems to breathe, in such a case, from the very stones and to make a thick strong liquor of the very air, you may thus gather as you pass what is most to your purpose; which is more the indestructible mixture of lived things, with its concentrated lingering odour, than any interminable list of numbered chapters and verses. Chapters and verses, literally scanned, refuse coincidence, mostly, with the divisional proprieties of your own pile of manuscript--which is but another way of saying, in short, that if the Lizza is a mere fortified promontory of the great Sienese hill, serving at once as a stronghold for the present military garrison and as a planted and benched and band-standed walk and recreation-ground for the citizens, so I could never, toward close of day, either have enough of it or yet feel the vaguest saunterings there to be vain. They were vague with the qualification always of that finer massing, as one wandered off, of the bronzed and seasoned element, the huge rock pedestal, the bravery of walls and gates and towers and palaces and loudly asserted dominion; and then of that pervaded or mildly infested air in which one feels the experience of the ages, of which I just spoke, to be exquisitely in solution; and lastly of the wide, strange, sad, beautiful horizon, a rim of far mountains that always pictured, for the leaner on old rubbed and smoothed parapets at the sunset hour, a country not exactly blighted or deserted, but that had had its life, on an immense scale, and had gone, with all its memories and relics, into rather austere, in fact into almost grim and misanthropic, retirement. This was a manner and a mood, at any rate, in all the land, that favoured in the late afternoons the divinest landscape blues and purples--not to speak of its favouring still more my practical contention that the whole guarded headland in question, with the immense ramparts of golden brown and red that dropped into vineyards and orchards and cornfields and all the rustic elegance of the Tuscan podere, was knitting for me a chain of unforgettable hours; to the justice of which claim let these divagations testify.|$|E
6000|$|That {{was to be}} {{more than}} made up on this later {{occasion}} by an hour of early evening, snatched on the run back to Rome, that remains with me as one of those felicities we are wise to leave for ever, just as they are, just, that is, where they fell, never attempting to renew or improve them. So happy a chance was it that ensured me at the afternoon's end a solitary stroll through the Villa d' Este, where the day's invasion, whatever it might have been, had left no traces and where I met nobody in the great rococo passages and chambers, and in the prodigious alleys and on the repeated flights of tortuous steps, but the haunting Genius of Style, into whose noble battered old face, as if it had come out clearer in the golden twilight and on recognition of response so deeply moved, I seemed to exhale my sympathy. This was truly, amid a conception and order of things all mossed over from disuse, but still without a form abandoned or a principle disowned, one of the hours that one doesn't forget. The ruined fountains seemed strangely to wait, in the stillness and under cover of the approaching dusk, not to begin ever again to play, also, but just only to be tenderly imagined to do so; quite as everything held its breath, at the mystic moment, for the drop of the cruel and garish exposure, for the Spirit of the place to steal forth and go his round. The vistas of the innumerable mighty cypresses ranged themselves, in their files and companies, like beaten heroes for their captain's, review; the great artificial [...] "works" [...] of every description, cascades, hemicycles, all graded and grassed and stone-seated as for floral games, mazes and bowers and alcoves and grottos, brave indissoluble unions of the planted and the builded symmetry, with the terraces and staircases that overhang and the arcades and cloisters that underspread, made common cause together as for one's taking up a little, in kindly lingering wonder, the [...] "feeling" [...] out of which they have sprung. One didn't see it, under the actual influence, one wouldn't for the world have seen it, as that they longed to be justified, during a few minutes in the twenty-four hours, of their absurdity of pomp and circumstance--but only that they asked for company, once in a way, as they were so splendidly formed to give it, and that the best company, in a changed world, at the end of time, what could they hope it to be but just the lone, the dawdling person of taste, the visitor with a flicker of fancy, not to speak of a pang of pity, to spare for them? It was in the flicker of fancy, no doubt, that as I hung about the great top-most terrace in especial, and then again took my way through the high gaunt corridors and the square and bare alcoved and recessed saloons, all overscored with such a dim waste of those painted, those delicate and capricious decorations which the loggie of the Vatican promptly borrowed from the ruins of the Palatine, or from whatever other revealed and inspiring ancientries, and which make ghostly confession here of that descent, I gave the rein to my sense of the sinister too, of that vague <b>after-taste</b> as of evil things that lurks so often, for a suspicious sensibility, wherever the terrible game {{of the life of the}} Renaissance was played as the Italians played it; wherever the huge tessellated chessboard seems to stretch about us; swept bare, almost always violently swept bare, of its chiselled and shifting figures, of every value and degree, but with this echoing desolation itself representing the long gasp, as it were, of overstrained time, the great after-hush that follows on things too wonderful or dreadful.|$|E

40|$|Sensory {{data were}} {{collected}} from ready-to-eat (RTE) cereal breakfast foods and asparagus using quantitative descriptive analysis. The collated data were subjected to univariate and multivariate statistical procedures. ^ Trained panelists using wide a array of RTE breakfast cereals generated 16 sensory descriptors covering appearance, texture, flavor and <b>after-taste.</b> ANOVA in conjunction with MANOVA of the RTE breakfast cereal data showed that each of seven panelist can proficiently discriminate between RTE cereal breakfast foods. Principal component analysis, based on panelists scores, effectively segregated 3 of the panelists and considered them as outliers. When scores of the outliers were deleted and the remaining data were pooled and subjected to ANOVA, 13 of the 16 descriptors were classified as discriminators. Factor analysis effectively reduced the 13 discriminators into 3 orthogonal factors with as little loss of information as possible. Finally based on the sensory characteristics of RTE cereal breakfast foods, discriminant analysis was able to group them into their respective sugar categories. ^ Quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) done on green and white (blanched) asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.) by trained panelists generated 11 flavor descriptors which were categorized as aromatic, up-front taste and <b>after-taste.</b> Through factor analysis the 11 flavor descriptors were further reduced to five orthogonal factors namely Factor 1, component related to green and leafy vegetables, Factor 2, component related to yellow vegetables, Factor 3, the <b>after-taste</b> component, Factor 4, the sulfury component and Factor 5, the sweet pea component. ^ Slopes of individual panelists with time was used to determine who among the panelists were entirely different in their flavor perception. Deletion of panelists with completely different slopes reduced variability within treatment. ^ Repeated measures analysis of variance when applied to the harvest data, which was collected over 5 weeks, indicated that white asparagus has a higher <b>after-taste</b> component as well as sweet pea components.

In this study, the effects of mood state on taste sensitivity was evaluated in humans who were exposed to conditions of mental or physical fatigue and tension. Taste responses to quinine sulfate (bitter), citric acid (sour) and sucrose (sweet) were tested. The intensity of the taste sensations were recorded by a computerized time-intensity (Tl) on-line system. Subjects performed mental tasks by personal computer or physical tasks by ergometer for 10 - 40 min. Before and after these sessions, the duration of the <b>after-taste</b> and the intensity of the sensation of taste were recorded by the Tl system, and in addition, psychological mood states were evaluated with POMS (Profile of Mood State). Tl evaluation showed that after the mental tasks, the perceived duration of bitter, sour and sweet taste sensations was shortened relative to the control. Total amount of bitterness, sourness and sweetness was also significantly reduced. Furthermore, the maximum intensity of bitterness was significantly reduced. There {{were no significant differences in}} bitterness and sweetness sensations following physical tasks. However, relative to before the physical task, the duration of the <b>after-taste</b> of sourness was significantly shortened by the physical task. After the physical task, the buffering capacity of saliva was significantly increased. Thus mental and physical tasks alter taste perception in different ways; the mechanisms underlying these changes remain to be determined. Chem. Senses 21 : 195 - 200, 1996...|$|E
40|$|Four antacid {{preparations}} {{have been}} studied in a stratified, randomized, double-blind trial to evaluate criteria which determine patients' acceptance {{of this type of}} therapy. There was a considerable range of judgements about palatability, but preference was determined not only by factors such as the smell, taste, texture and <b>after-taste</b> of the preparation, but also by the order in which the antacids were tested and by the age and sex of the patient. The preparations also differed considerably in acid-neutralizing capacity and ability to bind bile salts, as well as cost. We conclude that individuals requiring antacid therapy should be allowed to chose from among a range of preparations, in order to maximize compliance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how short-short stories published {{on social media}} platforms such asFacebook and Twitter experiment with brevity. It examines the use of devices such as planned spaces between words, colors, and enjambments, a genre called twitter fiction, to deliver the literary <b>after-taste</b> of ‘byte-sized’ fiction. What are the ramifications, requirements, and results of this form of brevity? Since the works are written and published on/for the digital media, what other aids supplement the reading process, if any? What forms of innovation does this conciseness allow? Two platforms of reading and writing short-short stories (of 140 characters or less) {{will be used to}} examine these questions: Terribly Tiny Tales on Facebook and Very Short Story (@veryshortstory) on Twitter...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{microflora}} fermentation causes {{changes in}} freshly tapped palm sap and therefore makes its storage, transport, and large scale use difficult. This study {{was aimed at}} developing stable and value added products, including syrup and non-alcoholic “malt-like ” drink from the sap of palms. The sap of Raphia hookeri collected from “evening-to-morning”(1700 Hrs- 0700 Hrs) and “morning-to-afternoon ” (0700 Hrs- 1600 Hrs), respectively, {{were used in the}} preparation of syrup. The respective syrups were in turn used in combination with varying proportions of water, sugar, and caramel for the formulation of six(6) palm “malt-like ” drinks from which the best (from sensory evaluation) was carbonated and named Palm Malt. The prepared Palm Malt was compared to commercially popular malt drinks on the market. A nine point hedonic scale (1 =like extremely – 9 =dislike extremely) was used by a panel of 56 to evaluate the colour, taste, flavour and <b>after-taste,</b> as well as overall consumer acceptability of the product. Proximate and physicochemical analyses were also carried out on the sap, syrup and Palm Malt using standard procedures. Descriptive statistics (percentages...|$|E
