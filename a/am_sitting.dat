We came last night, {{got up to}} a {{delightful}} spring day, {{and we are now}} enjoying the little book room, with the windows open, hearing the birds sing, and the place looking beautiful. The plants in the passage are just watered: and with the passage door open the room smells like a greenhouse. Pamela has dressed four beautiful flower-pots, and is now working at her frame, while I write to my dearest mother; and upon the two little stands are six pots of fine auriculas, and I <b>am</b> <b>sitting</b> in a bay window with all those pleasant feelings which the fine weather, the pretty place, the singing birds, the pretty wife and Frescati give me.|$|E

500|$|An older cousin, Josef Smetana, {{a teacher}} at the Premonstratensian School in Plzeň (Pilsen), then offered to {{supervise}} the boy's remaining schooling, and in the summer of 1840 Smetana departed for Plzeň. He remained there until he completed his schooling in 1843. His skills as a pianist were in great demand at the town's many soirées, and he enjoyed a hectic social life. This included a number of romances, the most important of which was with Kateřina Kolářová, whom he had known briefly in his early childhood. Smetana was entirely captivated with her, writing in his journal: [...] "When I am not with her I <b>am</b> <b>sitting</b> on hot coals and have no peace". He composed several pieces for her, among which are two Quadrilles, a song duet, and an incomplete piano study for the left hand. He also composed his first orchestral piece, a B-flat minuet.|$|E

500|$|Lowell {{returned}} to the United States and began his duties at Harvard {{in the summer of}} 1856. Still grieving the loss of his wife, however, he avoided Elmwood, lodging instead in an area known as Professors' Row on Kirkland Street in Cambridge along with his daughter Mabel and her governess Frances Dunlap. Lowell and Dunlap married in 1857. After the death of Lowell's father in January 1861 due to a heart attack, he moved back to Elmwood with his family. Despite avoiding the home for so long, he was pleased to be back. He wrote to his friend Charles Frederick Briggs: [...] "I am back again to the place I love best. I <b>am</b> <b>sitting</b> in my old garret, at my old desk, smoking my old pipe... I begin to feel more like my old self than I have these ten years". However, Elmwood's expenses drained him, with taxes at $1,000 a year. As early as 1867, he considered renting out Elmwood and moving into a smaller home elsewhere but never did. Instead, to ease his financial plight, he began to sell off land in 1870 until only two and a half acres remained.|$|E
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1857, The Atlantic Monthly was established, and Lowell was its first editor. With its first issue in November of that year, he at once gave the {{magazine}} the stamp of high literature and of bold speech on public affairs. In January 1861, Lowell's father {{died of a heart}} attack, inspiring Lowell to move his family back to Elmwood. As he wrote to his friend Briggs, [...] "I am back again to the place I love best. I <b>am</b> <b>sitting</b> in my old garret, at my old desk, smoking my old pipe... I begin to feel more like my old self than I have these ten years." [...] Shortly thereafter, in May, he left The Atlantic Monthly when James Thomas Fields took over as editor; the magazine had been purchased by Ticknor and Fields for $10,000 two years before. Lowell returned to Elmwood by January 1861 but maintained an amicable relationship with the new owners of the journal, continuing to submit his poetry and prose {{for the rest of his}} life. His prose, however, was more abundantly presented in the pages of the North American Review during the years 1862–1872. For the Review, he served as a coeditor along with Charles Eliot Norton. Lowell's reviews for the journal covered a wide variety of literary releases of the day, though he was writing fewer poems.|$|E

2500|$|Much of his time, however, {{was spent}} in a mellow mood. At this time he wrote [...] "Merry England" [...] (which {{appeared}} in the December 1825 New Monthly Magazine). [...] "As I write this", he wrote, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sitting</b> {{in the open air}} in a beautiful valley.... Intent upon the scene and upon the thoughts that stir within me, I conjure up the cheerful passages of my life, and a crowd of happy images appear before me".|$|E

Under Dougherty at Gona they had been thrown against an entrenched Japanese force, which had been massively underestimated in strength. Many good men who had fought alongside Potts in the Middle East and Kokoda died at Gona.
