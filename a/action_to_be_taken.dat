During a match against Catania on 1 December, Balotelli accused opponent Nicolás Spolli of racially abusing him, but there was insufficient evidence for any <b>action</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken.</b> The following week, Balotelli scored two goals in a 2–2 draw with Livorno, including a sensational 30-yard direct free kick that was clocked at a speed of 109km/h.|$|E

Also on 5 February there was criticism that nearby farmers had not been advised as to the <b>action</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken.</b> Around 320 workers at the plant were given anti-viral drugs. Although a vet from the site was admitted into hospital, suffering from a 'mild respiratory illness' during the evening of 6 February, it was found not to be bird flu. The plant was thoroughly disinfected, with cleaning complete on 12 February, and permission being given for production to resume.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, 19 October 2011, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs Teo Chee Hean {{explained the}} relevance of the ISA and its powers of preventive detention. He noted that in the 1960s preventive detention was primarily used to counter the subversive Communist threat posed by the Malayan Communist Party which was hiding within legal organizations. For the past two decades, though, preventive detention has helped safeguard Singapore's national security by countering threats posed by espionage and terrorism. Preventive detention allows for a comprehensive assessment of a threat, as opposed to a criminal case tried before a court which requires the court to consider only the specific acts that relate to the charge. Detaining those who have not yet committed overt deeds that warrant prosecution also allows pre-emptive <b>action</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to neutralize threats before they materialize into actual harm. In addition, the Minister said that detention without trial is preferable in situations where open prosecutions in court are not practicable due to the confidentiality of certain intelligence. Such intelligence might have been obtained through foreign security agencies on the understanding that the source and details would not be disclosed to an open court. What is more, disclosure of confidential intelligence could compromise ongoing or future operations through the revelation of existing sources and methods of intelligence gathering. However, if confidential information were withheld from the court, a criminal case could be weakened due to evidential requirements, which may result in the acquittal of an otherwise guilty accused. Finally, court proceedings may stall investigations {{as part of a broader}} network, and could exacerbate situations where communal sensitivities are involved.|$|E

Thus is, if genocidal acts occurred, they were beyond the power given by the 1918 Ordinance. Gaudron J went further and held that genocide was so fundamentally abhorrent that the Australian Parliament did not have the Constitutional power to make laws authorising acts of genocide. Her Honour was however the only judge to find a right to freedom from genocide.|$|E

In 1937, Linstead was awarded the OBE for services to the industry. In 1938 when the Central Pharmaceutical War Committee was set up, Linstead became its Secretary.

25|$|The Republicans {{were in a}} {{hurry to}} force the city to {{surrender}} as the rainy weather of autumn would prevent any further military <b>action</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken.</b> Upon his arrival Díaz proclaimed that his intents were to arrest General Márquez, Tomás O'Horán and the former Minister of State. He also stated that he would execute all the Austrian auxiliaries if they were captured.

On 20 April Agnes Salm-Salm, a Prussian princess in Imperial service, appeared at the camp of Díaz and offered the disbandment of the European troops in exchange for the guarantee of their and Maximilian's lives and free passage back to Europe.

25|$|The 'red plan' {{targeted}} {{victims and}} detailed <b>action</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> against them. The scenario, {{as described by}} Max Coleman in A Crime Against Humanity: Analysing the Repression of the Apartheid State, was as follows:Step 1: A person or a target would be identified as {{an enemy of the}} State. A cell member would then be instructed to monitor the 'target'.Step 2: A project - i.e. the elimination of a target would be registered with the co-ordinator. The co-ordinator would then have the project authorised by the regional manager and the managing director.Step 3: The CCB member would then do a reconnaissance to study the target's movements with a view to eliminating him or her.Step 4: The operative would propose the most practical method to the managing director. If the director felt this method was efficient, he would sign the proposal at what was called an 'in-house' meeting. There adjustments could be made to the plan before it was approved. The budget would be considered and finance would be made available for the project. The finance would come from the budget the Defence Force allocated to CCB activities. Indications are that money was always paid in cash.Step 5: The co-ordinator would be requested to make available the necessary arms and ammunition such as limpet mines, poison and/or live ammunition or other logistical support such as transport, etc.Step 6: The project would be carried out and the target would be eliminated. To do this the cell member could engage the assistance of what were termed 'unconscious members'. These were essentially underworld criminals who would, for money, kill as instructed. These 'unconscious' members were never told of the motive or the SADF connection - a false motive was usually supplied.|$|E

500|$|In September 2006 Pope Benedict XVI gave {{a speech}} on the {{question}} of the [...] "reasonableness" [...] of the Christian faith, to the University of Regensburg in Germany.

[...] The citation attracted severe criticism from Muslims around the world, including the parliament of Pakistan which condemned the Pope for his comments, and which sought an apology from him. [...] Following the speech, on 17 September Choudary led a protest outside Westminster Cathedral, where he told reporters [...] "Whoever insults the message of Mohammed is going to be subject to capital punishment." [...] The Daily Mail reported him as saying: [...] "I am here [...] have a peaceful demonstration, but there may be people in Italy and other parts that would carry that out." [...] The Metropolitan Police investigated his comments, but concluded that [...] "no substantive offences" [...] were committed during the demonstration. The Shadow Home Secretary, David Davis, who had called for <b>action</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> against Choudary, said: [...] "It is quite disgraceful.
