5|$|Avonmouth {{railway station}} was the {{terminus}} of the Bristol Port Railway and Pier, a self-contained railway which {{ran along the}} River Avon in Bristol, England. The station, which opened in 1865, was adjacent to a pier on the River Severn at Avonmouth. It had two platforms and an adjacent hotel, {{as well as an}} engine shed and water tank. The station was closed in 1902 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> was required for the expansion of Avonmouth Docks, although it remained in use for workers' trains until 1903. The hotel continued in operation until 1926, when it too was demolished {{to make way for the}} docks. The station site is now in the middle of Avonmouth Docks.|$|E
5|$|Shaw and Crompton's built {{environment}} {{is similar to}} the urban structure of most towns in England, consisting of residential dwellings centred on a High Street in the town centre, which is the local centre of commerce. There is a mixture of low-density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Shaw and Crompton, but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is residential; industrial areas and terraced houses give way to suburbs and rural greenery <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> rises out of the town. Generally, property in the centre, west, and south of the town is older and smaller in comparison to that found in the east and north.|$|E
5|$|The chief threats {{faced by}} the brolga, {{particularly}} {{in the southern part}} of its range, are habitat destruction, the drainage of wetlands, collision with powerlines, and predation by the introduced red fox. It is more secure in its northern habitat <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> is mostly unsuitable for farming and much of it is in national parks or private ownership, but changes in vegetation cover, encouraged by the rooting activities of feral pigs, may reduce the abundance of bulkuru sedge and may make the brolga more vulnerable by providing cover for predators.|$|E

5|$|The {{coalition}} army {{then proceeded}} to Amyclae, from whence they plundered the surrounding countryside. Lucius Quinctius, meanwhile, received the voluntary surrender of several coastal towns in Laconia. The allies then advanced on the largest city in the area, Sparta's port and naval arsenal at Gythium. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> forces began to invest the city, the allied navy arrived. The sailors from the three fleets set to construct siege engines within a few days. Though these machines had a devastating effect on the city walls, the garrison successfully held out.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of Avonmouth Docks, {{and particularly the}} construction of Royal Edward Dock, led to the closure of Avonmouth station, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> was required for construction. Services {{for the general public}} were withdrawn on 1 October 1902, but the station was used for unadvertised workers' trains until 15 May 1903, with the official closure the following day. After the closure of the station, all trains terminated at Avonmouth Dock. The station site is now in the middle of Avonmouth Docks.|$|E
5|$|The {{marshes and}} meres {{surrounding}} the village supported fishing since Saxon times, {{at least until}} significant draining during the 17th century. Eels were plentiful in the waters {{in and around the}} Isle of Ely (Eel–ey). In 1086, Little Thetford was worth 3,250 eels to the nearby abbots. In one year, 1087, it was written that 52,000 eels were caught in and around the city. The islands in this landscape supported pastures; whilst reeds, peat, and rushes were harvested from the wetlands. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> was drained, arable farming became the dominant activity, as it is today.|$|E

5|$|While the Beagle {{surveyed}} {{the coasts of}} South America from February 1832 to September 1835, Darwin made several trips inland and found extensive evidence that the continent was gradually rising. After witnessing an erupting volcano from the ship, he experienced the 1835 Concepción earthquake. In the following months he speculated that <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> was uplifted, {{large areas of the}} ocean bed subsided. It struck him that this could explain the formation of atolls.|$|E
5|$|Wildfire {{intensity}} increases during daytime hours. For example, burn {{rates of}} smoldering logs {{are up to}} five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground {{during the day and}} causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.|$|E
5|$|According to Dekema, {{planning}} for I-805 began in 1956. The original routing for I-805 was approved as an Interstate Highway in July1958. It {{was added to}} the state highway system and the Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 as Route241. I-805 was expected to reduce traffic on what was then US101 between Los Angeles and San Diego, when the former was opened. Route241 was renumbered to Route805 in the 1964 state highway renumbering, and I-5 was designated along the route from Los Angeles to San Diego. Further planning was underway in 1965, with the goal to have the route built by 1972, the federal highway funding deadline. This was to be the first freeway in the area with no prior road along its route that it would replace; the goal was to provide a bypass around San Diego for those traveling to Mexico, and improve access for local residents. By June, houses along the route in the North Park area were being sold, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> was needed for the first stretch of the freeway to be constructed. The next year, Dekema confirmed that the first portion of what was known as the Inland Freeway to be built would be between Home and Adams avenues.|$|E

5|$|As the gambier {{and pepper}} {{plantations}} expanded in the 1870s, the more established Kangchu were entrusted with larger blocks of farms and made contracts with Chinese merchants from Singapore. The profits generated from harvests of these plantations formed {{the bulk of}} Johor's economy, and financed the development of Johor's infrastructure. Abu Bakar's relationship with the Chinese leaders was excellent, and he appointed many of them to political positions in the state. Of particular note, Abu Bakar appointed two Chinese leaders to the Johor State Council: a Kangchu from Chaozhou, Tan Hiok Nee, and a contractor from Taishan, Wong Ah Fook, who also owned gambier and pepper farms in Mersing in the 1880s. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> along the river banks in Southern Johor was already taken by the earlier waves of Chinese settlers, newer Chinese settlers began migrating northwards in the 1870s and established new gambier and pepper plantations further north; new plantations were established in Yong Peng, Batu Pahat, Benut, Endau and Kota Tinggi. In particular, Abu Bakar actively encouraged Chinese settlers to establish plantations in Muar, shortly after the British Colonial Government ruled in favour of Abu Bakar over Tengku Alam Shah (Sultan Ali's eldest son) and his family, and granted Abu Bakar control of Muar.|$|E
5|$|Birth by Sleep is a prequel to {{the first}} Kingdom Hearts game, taking place ten years prior. Like the other games in the series, the player {{progresses}} through a collection of various worlds, based on various locales from the Disney animated features canon: Dwarf Woodlands from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Enchanted Dominion from Sleeping Beauty, Castle of Dreams from Cinderella, Olympus Coliseum from Hercules, Deep Space from Lilo & Stitch, Neverland from Peter Pan and Mysterious Tower from Fantasia. The game also features various new worlds specially created for the series by Square Enix such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> of Departure and Radiant Garden. Disney Town, which is the town that surrounds the castle grounds of Disney Castle, serves as the game's minigame world. Worlds such as Destiny Islands and Castle Oblivion also appear {{in the form of}} cutscenes, while the 100 Acre Wood from the Winnie the Pooh franchise, which had appeared in most other games of the series, only appears as a Command Board in Birth by Sleep. The staff first chose the worlds based on the game's scenario, leading to the inclusion of Princesses' worlds. They then added the worlds of Neverland and Deep Space to add variety to the game, while Olympus Coliseum was selected to reflect the game's earlier setting compared to the original Kingdom Hearts.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Devonian period (400 Mya) the sea was retreating from the Welsh Basin <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> was thrust up by the collision of land masses, forming a new range of mountains, the Welsh Caledonides. The strata were compressed and deformed, and in places, the clay minerals recrystallised, developing a grain that allowed parallel cleavage, making it easy to split the rocks into thin flat sheets of stone known as slate. In the Carboniferous period (360 to 300 Mya), erosion of the mountains resulted in the formation of sandstones and mudstones. A reinvasion of southern and northeastern parts of Wales by the sea resulted in depositions of limestone, and extensive swamps in South Wales gave rise to peat deposits and the eventual formation of coal measures. Southwestern Wales, in particular, was affected by the Variscan orogeny, a period when continental collisions further south caused complex folding and fracturing of the strata.|$|E

5|$|Ezra Meeker's farm at Swamp Place was not {{a success}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> was too poor to grow crops. The family {{continued}} to run the store in Steilacoom. On January 5, 1861, Oliver Meeker drowned while returning from a buying trip to San Francisco, when his ship, the Northerner, sank off the California coast. The Meekers had borrowed to finance the trip, and the losses from this disaster reduced Ezra Meeker to near penury. He secured the squatter's claim of Jerry Stilly on land in the Puyallup Valley, and moved {{his wife and children}} there in 1862. While clearing his own holdings, he earned money by helping to clear the land of others. His father and surviving brother, John Meeker, also had claims in the valley. John Meeker had come to Washington Territory by ship in 1859 and had settled in the Puyallup Valley. Ezra Meeker ran for the Washington Territorial Legislature in 1861, but was defeated. In 1869, Meeker ran for Pierce County Surveyor; he was defeated by James Gallagher, 138 votes to 116.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{mismanagement}} {{and internal}} disputes led to {{delays in the}} project. By the time Brookwood Cemetery opened in late 1854, {{a number of other}} cemeteries had opened nearer to London or {{were in the process of}} opening. While some parishes in London did arrange for the LNC to handle the burials of their dead, many preferred to use nearer cemeteries. The LNC had anticipated handling between 10,000 and 50,000 burials per year, but the number never rose above 4,100 per year, and in its first 150 years of operations only 231,730 burials had been conducted. Buying the land for Brookwood Cemetery and building the cemetery and railway had been very expensive, and by the time the cemetery opened the LNC was already on the verge of bankruptcy. The LNC remained solvent by selling surplus parts of its land, but <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> had been chosen in the first place for its remoteness, sales were low.|$|E
5|$|The Great Famine of 1845–1851 devastated Ireland, as {{in those}} years Ireland's {{population}} fell by one-third. More than one million people died from starvation and disease, while an additional two million people emigrated, mostly to the United States and Canada. By {{the end of the}} decade, half of all immigration to the United States was from Ireland. The period of civil unrest that followed {{until the end of the}} 19th century is referred to <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> War. Mass emigration became deeply entrenched and the population continued to decline until the mid-20th century. Immediately prior to the famine the population was recorded as 8.2 million by the 1841 census. The population has never returned to this level since. The population continued to fall until 1961 and it was not until the 2006 census that the last county of Ireland (County Leitrim) to record a rise in population since 1841 did so.|$|E
