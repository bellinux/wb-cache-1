Mike Callahan and Joseph [...] "Red Dog" [...] Campbell became the band’s early crew members.

In Macon, the group stayed at friend Twiggs Lyndon's apartment on 309 College Street, which {{became known as}} the communal home of the band and crew, nicknamed the Hippie Crash Pad. [...] "There were five or six occupied apartments in the building with the Hippie Crash Pad and you would expect they would call the police on us because we were constantly raising hell at three or four in the morning, but they all just moved out," [...] said Trucks. [...] Living meagerly, they found a friend in [...] "Mama Louise" [...] Hudson, cook and proprietor of the H Soul Food Restaurant, who ran a tab when they were short of funds, early on made good with proceeds from Duane's recording sessions on the side. The band's image was radical in the just barely integrated Macon: [...] "A lot of the white folk around here did not approve of them long-haired boys, or of them always having <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>guy</b> with them," [...] said Hudson. The band performed locally, as well as 80 miles north in Atlanta's Piedmont Park, and practiced at the newly minted Capricorn nearly each day.|$|E

500|$|Before Chamberlain, {{the most}} {{dominant}} big man in the NBA was [...] George Mikan. In November 1950, the Fort Wayne Pistons held the ball for {{minutes at a time}} without shooting to limit the impact of the Minneapolis Lakers' Mikan. The Pistons attempted 13 shots in the game, and won 19–18. NBA President Maurice Podoloff said, [...] "In our game, with the number of stars we have, we of necessity run up big scores." [...] In the , teams averaged just above 80 points per game. The NBA introduced the 24-second shot clock in 1954, and league scoring and attendance increased. By the , teams were averaging 119points each game. Chamberlain that season was one of 37black players in the league, the NBA having started integration of blacks in 1950. With their emergence, the NBA game was stylistically being played faster and above the rim. Many of the league's great players were black, and blacks believed they were limited by a league quota of four black players per team. Critics suggested that basketball was becoming uninteresting with taller players dominating. Warriors teammate Joe Ruklick thought that [...] "the attitude [...] was, in my opinion, ' is a freak who will come and go. There will never be <b>a</b> <b>black</b> <b>guy</b> doing this again.'" [...] Chamberlain, nicknamed Dipper, was revolutionizing the sport with his slam dunks, nicknamed the Dipper Dunk. Traditionalists considered dunking poor sportsmanship, and their occurrence was rare. As the league's second tallest player, Chamberlain began dunking more regularly. He was still more of a finesse player, preferring fadeaway shots and finger rolls. He rarely dunked forcefully. Teammate Paul Arizin believed Chamberlain {{did not want to be}} perceived as great merely from being tall.|$|E
