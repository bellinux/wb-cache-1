Framing addiction within the sphere of 'choice' prompts behavioural economic theorists to predict that variables can be manipulated to influence choice from one direction to another, despite addiction. Recently, evidence has been provided which suggests that this 'choice' for addicts is somewhat impaired by problems in decision making, particular to substance dependent individuals.

40|$|The study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the relationship between pornography addiction and psychosocial and academic adjustment of students in universities in Lagos State. In order to achieve this objective, five research questions were formulated and two hypotheses postulated. The subjects for the study consisted of 616 full-time third-year undergraduate students from two universities in Lagos State. They were composed using purposive sampling technique. The instrument used for data collection was that researchers designed questionnaire titled “Pornography Addiction, Psychosocial and Academic Adjustment Instrument”. The reliability coefficient of the instrument was also determined, using the Cronbach alpha statistics which determines the coefficient of {{internal consistency of the}} instrument. The research questions were analyzed using mean scores and SD (standard deviation) while the null hypotheses were tested at 0. 05 level of significance using Pearson product moment coefficient and the t-test. The findings show that university students in Lagos State experienced high level of pornography addiction. The results also show that university students in Lagos State experienced moderate level of psychosocial and academic adjustment. There is a significant but negative relationship between pornography addiction and psychosocial adjustment. There is a slight positive relationship between pornography addiction and academic adjustment. Based on the findings, implications were highlighted.

40|$|Objective The present {{research}} explored the cortical correlates of rewarding mechanisms and cortical 'unbalance' effect in internet addiction (IA) vulnerability. Methods Internet Addiction Inventory (IAT) and personality trait (Behavioural Inhibition System, BIS; Behavioural Activation System, BAS) {{were applied to}} 28 subjects. Electroencephalographic (EEG, alpha frequency band) and response times (RTs) were registered during a Go-NoGo task execution in response to different online stimuli: gambling videos, videogames or neutral stimuli. Higher-IAT (more than 50 score, with moderate or severe internet addiction) and lower-IAT (< 50 score, with no internet addiction). Results Alpha band and RTs were affected by IAT, with significant bias (reduced RTs) for high-IAT in response to gambling videos and videogames; and by BAS, BAS-Reward subscale (BAS-R), since not only higher-IAT, but also BAS and BAS-R values determined an increasing of left prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity (alpha reduction) in response to videogames and gambling stimuli for both Go and NoGo conditions, in addition to decreased RTs for these stimuli categories. Conclusion The increased PFC responsiveness and the lateralisation (left PFC hemisphere) effect in NoGo condition was explained {{on the basis of}} a 'rewarding bias' towards more rewarding cues and a deficit in inhibitory control in higher-IAT and higher-BAS subjects. In contrast lower-IAT and lower-BAS predicted a decreased PFC response and increased RTs for NoGo (inhibitory mechanism).

40|$|Neuroimmune {{signalling}} underlies {{addiction and}} comorbid depression. Clinical observations indicate that infections and chronic lesions are more frequent in drug users and elevated inflammatory states {{are evident in}} cocaine dependents. Therefore, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and inflammatory cytokines represent an important tool for the investigation of sickness, depressive illness and <b>addiction</b> <b>behaviour.</b> A major component of addiction is the progressive and persistent increase in locomotor activity after repeated drug administration and even prolonged periods of abstinence. {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the response of locomotor sensitization when a non-sensitizing dose of cocaine is paired with a systemic inflammatory stimulus. LPS and cocaine were administered intraperitonealy in young-adult male C 57 b 1 / 6 mice during a 5 -day acquisition phase. After a 48 -h withdrawal period all groups were challenged with cocaine to evaluate locomotor expression. During the acquisition phase, the LPS-treated groups displayed characteristic hypolocomotion related to sickness behaviour. the low dose of cocaine did not increase the distance travelled, characterizing a non-sensitization dose. Groups that received both LPS and cocaine did not display hypolocomotion, indicating that cocaine might counteract hypolocomotion sickness behaviour. Moreover, during challenge, only these animals expressed locomotor sensitization. Our results indicate that LPS could facilitate the expression of locomotor sensitization in mice and that the immune system may modulate cocaine-induced sensitization. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Drug {{addiction}} is a brain disease {{which leads to}} profound disturbances in an individual’s behaviour. In spite of the progress made {{in the understanding of}} the neurobiological mechanisms underlying addiction, expectations from a therapeutic point of view have not been satisfying. Given the modest efficacy of therapeutic tools available, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) seems to be a promising “non-pharmacologic” aid in various neuropathologies including addiction which is characterized by a decrease of dopaminergic activity (DA). Thus, ‘restoring’ pre-pathology DA activity may yield clinical benefits in addicts. In particular, {{it has been reported that}} TMS reduces the craving for cocaine in cocaine addicts. Thus, the main aims of the present project is to apply bilateral dTMS to the Dorso-Lateral Pre-frontal Cortices of cocaine abusers in order to deepen understanding the neural correlates of addiction; to identify optimal parameters of stimulation; and, above all, to evaluate short/long term therapeutic effects of dTMS. Wee applied dTMS in nineteen cocaine abusers (average age: 34, 57; F: 2; M: 17) selected on DSM IV criteria and randomly assigned to real/sham stimulation protocols. Fourteen of them are currently included in the study while four abandoned due to personal problems (4 drop-out) and one has been excluded because he did not satisfy inclusion criteria. We assessed the intake of cocaine through self-reports and hair analysis at different times pre- (T 0) and post-treatment (T 1 T 2 T 3 [...] ). We considered the psycho-social impact of <b>Addiction</b> <b>behaviour</b> by assessing the anxiety (STAY- 1; STAY- 2) and the several dimension of hostility (BDHI) before and after stimulation (T 0, T 1,T 2,T 3 [...] ). The interim analysis shows that all subjects have reduced intake of cocaine regardless of the frequency (1 Hz n. = 6 or 10 Hz n. = 8) of the stimulation protocol applied (sham condition was administered in six subjects). Six months after treatment (T 3) all subjects show a reduction in cocaine intake with no distinction among groups (real vs sham nor 10 vs 1 Hz). More cases are needed in 1 Hz and sham conditions to “balance” the groups. The follow-up data, however, shows a strong persistence of the effect in the real group, and decidedly weaker maintenance in sham group. An analogues trend has been observed also in psychological dimensions. We hypothesize an initial placebo/sham effect which disappears over time in the sham patients group. Nevertheless these preliminary data encourage further investigation to evaluate the potential effects of dTMS in the treatment of cocaine abusers and in the prevention of relapses...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Addiction is a {{cyclical}} disorder associated with rigid, habit like behaviour {{and a high}} propensity to relapse into drug seeking. Up to 90 % of addicts will relapse during in their treatment, posing a substantial clinical hurdle to recovery. Currently, few pharmacotherapies are available to aid in recovery from drug seeking and prevention of relapse. The lack of effective treatment options {{is a product of}} our limited understanding of the persistent neuroadaptations that render individuals vulnerable to addiction and relapse. The striatum is a critical brain region involved in regulation of many facets of addiction-like behaviour, including reinforcement of conditioned stimuli and regulation of habit-like behaviour. Importantly, the striatum can be divided into four functionally heterogenous subregions: the nucleus accumbens shell (NACsh) and core (NACc) and the dorsomedial (DM) and dorsolateral (DL) striatum. A number of studies have identified changes in synaptic plasticity processes in these regions following illicit drug use. However, the molecular mechanisms that contribute to synaptic plasticity are yet to be fully elucidated. This thesis aimed to uncover the role of a number of critical synaptic plasticity associated genes in the development of addiction. Moreover, I aimed to understand the role of miRNA regulation of these genes, and how these changes in molecular substrates may contribute to addiction vulnerability. I first investigated the role of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC 1) in regulation of cocaine taking, withdrawal and reinstatement of drug use. mTORC 1 is a serine threonine kinase involved in the translation of several synaptic plasticity proteins, including AMPAR subunits and CAMKIIα, and has been previously implicated in <b>addiction</b> <b>behaviour.</b> I observed that withdrawal from cocaine taking increased mTORC 1 activity in the NAC. Moreover, inhibition of mTORC 1 using rapamycin decreased the expression of addiction-like behaviour, while reducing markers of mTORC 1 activity. Intra-cerebroventricular injection of rapamycin also decreased the motivation to consume cocaine measured using progressive ratio (PR) testing. Furthermore, inhibition of mTORC 1 in the NACsh reduced PR responding as well as cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. These addiction behaviours were reduced by systemic administration of rapamycin. Critically, decreased expression of indices of mTORC 1 activity were evident in the NAC, but not DS. Together these experiments demonstrate a key role for mTORC 1 expression in the NAC but not DS in the regulation of addiction-like behaviour. Importantly, {{it has been shown that}} mTOR and other synaptic plasticity genes are altered in the striatum of rats that show evidence of addiction vulnerability. However, the mechanisms contributing to these changes are unclear. Thus, the second aim of this thesis was to assess the role of miRNA in the regulation of these critical synaptic plasticity genes. miRNA are short, non-coding RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression. I assessed the expression of miRNA in the striatal subregions and their role in regulation of synaptic plasticity genes. Previous evidence suggests that there is a global downregulation of synaptic plasticity genes, including mTOR, Arc and Drd 1, in the striatum of addiction-vulnerable animals compared to resilient controls. However, the results of my first study showed that decreased mTORC 1 in the NACsh reduced indices of addiction. Critically, this demonstrates a temporal time course for expression of these genes. As such, I developed a novel method of identifying addiction vulnerable animals throughout the course of the addiction cycle. I found that during the drug-taking phase of addiction cycle, cocaine self-administering rats had altered expression of key miRNA, including miR- 101 b, miR- 137, miR- 132 and miR- 212 in the striatal subregions. However, there were few changes between vulnerability groups. In contrast, there was a significant increase in the expression of these miRNA in the striatal subregions of addiction vulnerable rats compared to resilient controls following cocaine reinstatement. Importantly, miR- 212 has been implicated in the regulation of compulsive cocaine use. Moreover, miR- 101 b has been previously shown to regulate mTOR, and was found in the current thesis to regulate Drd 1 expression. These results suggest that miRNA are involved in the regulation of key synaptic plasticity genes involved in control of addiction relevant behaviour. Overall, the results of this thesis demonstrate a critical role for synaptic plasticity genes including mTOR, Arc and Drd 1 and their miRNA regulators in the development of addiction. My findings have helped to elucidate the molecular changes in the striatal subregions that may contribute to addiction vulnerability and an increased propensity to relapse in addicted individuals...|$|E
40|$|Methamphetamine is {{a widely}} abused, highly {{addictive}} drug. Regulation of synaptic proteins within the brain's reward pathway modulates <b>addiction</b> <b>behaviours,</b> the progression of drug addiction and long-term changes in brain structure and function that result from drug use. Therefore, using large scale proteomics studies we aim to identify global protein expression changes within the dorsal striatum, a key brain region involved in the modulation of addiction. We performed LC-MS/MS analyses on rat striatal synaptosomes following 30 days of methamphetamine self-administration (2 hours/day) and 14 days abstinence. We identified a total of 84 differentially-expressed proteins with known roles in neuroprotection, neuroplasticity, cell cytoskeleton, energy regulation and synaptic vesicles. We identify significant expression changes in stress-induced phosphoprotein and tubulin polymerisation-promoting protein, which have not previously been associated with addiction. In addition, we confirm the role of amphiphysin and phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein in addiction. This approach has provided new insight into the effects of methamphetamine self-administration on synaptic protein expression in a key brain region associated with addiction, showing a large set of differentially-expressed proteins that persist into abstinence.

40|$|Gambling is {{a popular}} activity, both {{globally}} and in the UK, {{with the majority of}} adults engaging in some degree of gambling behaviour. Contemporary views of gambling <b>behaviour,</b> <b>addiction</b> and <b>behaviour</b> change suggest that such behaviours move along a continuum and are subject to a variety of influences. Theories such as dual processing have highlighted the effects of implicit mechanisms on changing problem behaviours. In a longitudinal mixed methods design, a group of sixty regular gamblers were interviewed and tested at three-month intervals for up to two years. Data was gathered via semi-structured interviews, explicit self-report questionnaires (PGSI, Fallacious Beliefs, Dissociation) and implicit tasks (Gambling Stroop Task, Roulette MouseTracker Task). From the first session data levels of problem gambling (PGSI) were predicted by elements of each type of data collected (Self-reported gambling behaviours, MouseTracker and interview content analysed by LIWC 2007). The same measures were analysed as potential predictors of change in PGSI (N 41), but found no significant relationships. A quantitative analysis of interview data revealed measurable change in gamblers’ narratives (N 12) when comparing interviews from low scoring PGSI periods to interviews during high scoring PGSI periods. Further in-depth IPA analysis (N 12) identified six main themes including; external influence, conflict, self-identity, organisation and change. The findings support concepts of dual processing theory, demonstrating that a variety of methods are a stronger predictor of change than any one. Gambling behaviour as a multifaceted construct, which relies on individual self-concept alongside unconscious processes, held in place by gamblers’ narratives which adhere to a modern acceptance of gambling behaviour. The resulting conflict appears to sustain problem gambling for many regular gamblers, rather than allowing them either an acceptable gambling identity or a social view that assists their cessation. Suggested applications of the findings require an equally multi-faceted approach, exploring the psychological processes involved and helping both the individual and the society around them to develop a new narrative for gamblers...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Internet {{addiction}} {{has been}} the focus of attention of some researchers due to its negative implications on both individuals and families. A study conducted by the Institute for Applied Psychology (ISPA) mentions some of the consequences of internet addiction on students, namely their academic performance and success, as well as their interpersonal relationships and sleep disorders [1]. Objectives: To identify the sociodemographic variables that influence sleep quality of students; Identify academic variables influencing sleep quality of students; to analyse the influence of the variable addition to internet in sleep quality of students. Methods: quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study involving a sample of 511 students attending higher education of the country's central region, with the highest prevalence in the age group of 17 - 21 years. Data collection includes the questionnaire of demographic data and academic context, the Internet will Addition Test (IAT) to Young [2] and Quality Questionnaire Pittsburgh Sleep h, validated by Duarte [3]. Results: Sample is mostly female (78. 7 %), prevailing students in the age group of 17 - 21 years (65. 8 %), living in urban areas (50. 9 %). Most (56. 4 %) attended the Polytechnic Institute of Viseu, 36. 0 % are in the 1 st year of the course and 22. 1 % the 2 nd year; 59. 7 % live with colleagues during school; 84. 5 % have a single room. The male students, older (22 - 24 years) living in urban areas, from the area of science, attend the 4 th year of the course, reside with relatives, are those who manifest worse sleep quality. With this study we notice that young students with higher internet addiction are the ones who display greater alterations in sleep quality and patterns (less sleep, more latency, less sleep efficacy and insomnia). We also verified that there is a negative and significant correlation between internet addiction and daily sleep duration. Beranuy et al [4] observed a positive relationship with sleep disorders and a negative relationship with psychological well-being, showing that sleep quality assumes a predictive and significant value for internet abuse. These results corroborate those reported by Young et al [2] where Internet dependence is shown to be associated with altered sleep patterns. In a similar fashion, Griffiths, M. D., & Szabo, A. [5] concluded that sleep duration was fewer in students with internet <b>addiction</b> <b>behaviours,</b> and also that excessive internet usage associates with an excessive daytime drowsiness. Conclusion: A good sleep hygiene is vital for university students’ success, heatlh and well-being, and considering that there is a significant negative correlation between the addition to the Internet and the sleep quality of higher education students, an intervention will be required to minimize the negative consequences of Internet addiction on the students’ quality of sleep. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Since MAO-A is {{an enzyme}} {{involved}} in the metabolism of neurotransmitters, fluctuations in MAO-A functionality are associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders {{as well as with}} tobacco <b>addiction</b> and <b>behaviour.</b> This study reports the radiolabelling of two [11 C]-labelled pyrrole- 2 -carboxamide derivates, RS 2315 and RS 2360, along with the characterization of their in vivo properties. Methods: The radiolabelling of [11 C]-RS 2315 and [11 C]-RS 2360 was accomplished by alkylation of their amide precursors with [11 C]CH 3 I. Biodistribution, blocking and metabolite studies of both tracers were performed in NMRI mice. Finally, a PET study in Sprague-Dawley rats was performed for [11 C]-RS 2360. Results: Both tracers were obtained in a radiochemical yield of approximately 30 % with radiochemical purity of > 98 %. Biodistribution studies showed high brain uptake followed by rapid brain clearance for both radiotracers. In the brain, [11 C]-RS 2360 was more stable than [11 C]-RS 2315. Blocking studies in mice could not demonstrate specificity of [11 C]-RS 2315 towards MAO-A or MAO-B. The blocking and imaging study with [11 C]-RS 2360 on the other hand indicated specific binding in MAO-A at the earliest time points. Conclusions: [11 C]-RS 2315 displayed a high nonspecific binding and is therefore not suitable for visualization of MAO-A in vivo. [11 C]-RS 2360 on the other hand has potential for mapping MAO-A since specific binding is demonstrated. © 2010...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project contains a first proposal, a second proposal, and {{an examination of}} the decision to change from the first to the second, and four products of the research. This was an aborted interview-intensive qualitative research initiative with paedophile sexual offenders. The second was the development of a treatment and training programme for sexual addiction. The change from the first to the second was caused by the secondary trauma that followed exposure to the primary trauma of others. The four products principally cover the following subjects: 1] narcissistic damage, sexual <b>addiction</b> and religious <b>behaviour</b> 2] causation issues in sexual abuse in the church 3] researching sensitive and distressing topics 4] treatment and training issues in sexual addiction. The fourth product was preceded by a quantitative {{research project}}. The whole of the above is anchored in the story of a personal journey and includes an analysis of the theory of sexual addiction...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies show}} the {{similarity}} of reward-related neurocircuitry and behavioral patterns between pathological gamblers and substance addictive patients. Evidences proved that pathological gambling (PG) and Substance Use Disorders (SUD) are associated with deficits in frontal lobe function and that they show similar behaviors to that of patients with bilateral VMPFC lesions. The present article aimed to compare the results of two studies concerning {{the relationship between the}} Behavioral Activation System (BAS) and the hemispheric lateralisation effect that supports the gambling behavior in addiction disease. In the two studies we considered a group of Cocaine Addictive (CA) patients and high-BAS healthy subjects who were tested using the Iowa Gambling Task. Also metacognitive questionary and alpha band modulation were considered. It was found that the “left hemisphere unbalance” may be considered as a critical marker of dysfunctional decision-making in addictive behaviors (drug <b>addiction</b> and gambling <b>behaviours)</b> and a factor able to explain the tendency to opt in favor of more reward-related conditions...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{supporting}} {{the application of}} Brown's (1991, 1993) conception of behavioural <b>addiction</b> to computing <b>behaviour</b> is presented. Questionnaire items tapping Brown's addiction criteria were factor-analysed along with others, including computer apathy-engagement and computer anxiety-comfort items of Charlton and Birkett (1995). Items relating to some of Brown's criteria (tolerance, euphoria, and cognitive salience) {{were found to be}} complex, an Addiction factor loading upon them but an Engagement factor loading more highly. Items tapping other criteria (conflict, withdrawal, behavioural salience, and relapse and reinstatement) were shown to be factor pure, with only the addiction factor loading highly upon them. It is concluded that Brown's conception of behavioural addiction can be applied to computer-related behaviour, although the relationship of milder facets of addiction, which are also merely indicative of high engagement, to computer-related addictions is non-unique. It is also concluded that classifying individuals as exhibiting pathological computer use using checklists based upon adaptations of DSM criteria for pathological gambling is likely to overestimate the number of people addicted to computing activities...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Two {{seemingly}} contrary theories {{describe the}} learning mechanisms that mediate human addictive behaviour. According {{to the classical}} incentive theories of <b>addiction,</b> addictive <b>behaviour</b> is motivated by a Pavlovian conditioned appetitive emotional response elicited by drug-paired stimuli. Expectancy theory, on the other hand, argues that addictive behaviour is mediated by an expectancy of the drug imparted by cognitive knowledge of the Pavlovian (predictive) contingency between stimuli (S+) and the drug and of the instrumental (causal) contingency between instrumental behaviour and the drug. Aims and method: The present paper reviewed humannicotine- conditioning studies to assess the role of appetitive emotional conditioning and explicit contingency knowledge in mediating addictive behaviour. Results: The studies reviewed here provided evidence for both the emotional conditioning and the expectancy accounts. The first source of evidence is that nicotine-paired S+ elicit an appetitive emotional conditioned response (CR), albeit only in participants who expect nicotine. Furthermore, {{the magnitude of this}} emotional state is modulated by nicotine deprivation/satiation. However, the causal status of the emotional response in driving other forms of conditioned behaviour remains undemonstrated. The second source of evidence is that other nicotine CRs, including physiological responses, self-administration, attentional bias and subjective craving, are also dependent on participants possessing explicit knowledge of the Pavlovian contingencies arranged in the experiment. In addition, several of the nicotine CRs can be brought about or modified by instructed contingency knowledge, demonstrating the causal status of this knowledge. Conclusions: Collectively, these data suggest that human nicotine conditioned effects are mediated by an explicit expectancy of the drug coupled with an appetitive emotional response that reflects the positive biological value of the drug. The implication of this conclusion is that treatments designed to modify the expected value of the drug may prove effective...|$|R
