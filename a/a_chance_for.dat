40|$|This chapter {{provides}} {{a survey of}} changing national and global higher education policy contexts {{over the past three}} decades, specifically {{from the perspective of the}} publication of the <b>A</b> Fair <b>Chance</b> <b>for</b> All discussion paper in 1990. We show how <b>A</b> Fair <b>Chance</b> <b>for</b> All emerged from a specifically Australian conjunction of social justice commitments to ‘a fair go’ and the emergence of neo-liberalism. In this respect, <b>A</b> Fair <b>Chance</b> <b>for</b> All constitutes <b>an</b> early Australian exemplar of neo-social governance, and its emphasis on the introduction of targets and performance measures foreshadowed the rise of policy as numbers in education. <b>A</b> Fair <b>Chance</b> <b>for</b> All also prefigured a shift in student equity policy in higher education to focus on aspirations, which sought to activate people in relation to their educational potential, and it enshrined a conception of equity as fairness that would come to shape education policies globally in the decades that followed its publication...|$|R
5|$|Krusty is a {{favorite}} character {{of several of the}} original writers, many of whom related themselves to him and wanted to write the Krusty-focused episodes. Krusty was used as <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> show business jokes and thus many of Krusty's experiences and anecdotes are based on real experiences and stories heard by the writers. He was a particular favorite of Brad Bird, who directed the first two Krusty episodes and always tried to animate a scene in every Krusty episode.|$|E
5|$|Overdrive is the 19th studio album by pop punk trio Shonen Knife. It was {{released}} on April 14, 2014 in Europe, and on April 16, 2014 in Japan. According to band leader Naoko Yamano, because their album Free Time (2010) was heavily influenced by punk rock, and Pop Tune (2012) had explored a more pop-oriented sound, Overdrive was <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> the band to explore a more hard rock sound. The album's lyrics cover {{a wide array of}} topics, from green tea, fortune cookies, and cats.|$|E

5|$|The Broncos' {{first drive}} {{of the second}} quarter was halted after a holding penalty and an {{incomplete}} pass denied BSU <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> a first down. Boise was forced to kick the ball away once more. The Pirates' second drive of the quarter began at their 26–yard line. ECU needed just four plays to march 74yards down the field for a touchdown. On the drive, Chris Johnson rushed for 46yards and threw an 18–yard pass for a touchdown. After the touchdown and the extra point kick, ECU led 24–7.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand {{campaign}} was <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> the younger players to establish {{themselves in the}} national team. Meckiff took 2/46 and 3/25 in his first-class debut for Australia, an innings win over Otago. He played in the first match against New Zealand, but after taking 0/41 in a drawn encounter, he was dropped for the second game. The paceman forced his {{way back into the}} team for the third match after claiming 4/12 and 5/48 to help to set up an innings victory over Auckland.|$|E
5|$|The {{event has}} been {{described}} by historians as a decapitation strike, which was intended to deprive the Armenian population of leadership and <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> resistance. To commemorate the victims of the Armenian Genocide, 24 April is observed as Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day. First observed in 1919 on the four-year anniversary of the events in Constantinople, the date is generally considered the date on which the genocide began. The Armenian Genocide has since been commemorated annually on the same day, which has become a national holiday in Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and is observed by the Armenian diaspora around the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{limited time}} {{left in the}} game meant there was little chance the Hokies could make good the 20-point deficit. Tech's hopes flared after Nebraska's kickoff was {{returned}} 67 yards to the Nebraska 25-yard line, providing <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> a quick score. Druckenmiller completed a 14-yard pass after the long return, giving Tech a first down at the 11-yard line, but the Hokies were unable to advance the ball much further. Oxendine ran for five yards, but Druckenmiller threw three incomplete passes, turning the ball over on downs. With a firm lead, Nebraska proceeded to run four short rushes, running out the clock and bringing the game to an end. Nebraska won the 63rd Orange Bowl, 4121.|$|E

The MCC fielded seven players {{who went on to}} {{represent}} England in the Tests,N- and were basically a full-strength Test team, as were Australia, who fielded their first-choice team. It was <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> players from both countries to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Test matches, and Tallon was selected ahead of Saggers despite conceding byes at a higher rate in the opening tour matches. Saggers looked on as Tallon conceded 26 byes and Australia won by an innings.|$|E

5|$|With captain Johnson {{and vice}} captain Miller, the main spinner {{and one of}} the two leading fast bowlers {{retiring}} upon their return from the subcontinent, Australia moved into uncharted territory and needed younger bowlers to step up following three successive series losses to England. The 1956–57 Australian season was purely domestic and <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> the players to stake their claims to be part of Australia's future. Davidson scored 374 runs at 34.00 including three fifties and took 30 wicket at 27.50 from eight matches. His most effective effort was a 5/65 in the second innings of the match between Harvey's XI and Lindwall's XI. Davidson's effort helped set up a seven-wicket triumph for Harvey's men.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea, {{in their}} usual home strip of blue, kicked-off the match and {{immediately}} lost possession when Walcott dispossessed Matic. Walcott sent {{the ball to}} Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, whose cross on the right forced a punch from Thibaut Courtois. Francis Coquelin conceded a free kick in the sixth minute having fouled Willian inside Chelsea's half, though nothing came of the set piece. Fàbregas went down under the challenge of Per Mertesacker in Arsenal's penalty area soon afterwards, but his appeal for a penalty kick was turned down by referee Anthony Taylor and play resumed. Chelsea, having settled the slower of the two teams, began to dominate ball possession and won two early corners, {{both of which were}} easily dealt with. In the 17th minute, Nacho Monreal's charge forward was stopped by Cahill; the Chelsea defender in the process of making that challenge had suffered a nose bleed. A free kick for Arsenal presented <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> Walcott to score, but his header goalwards was saved.|$|E
