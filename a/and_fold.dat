5|$|The geology of Shetland is complex, with {{numerous}} faults <b>and</b> <b>fold</b> axes. These islands are the northern outpost of the Caledonian orogeny, {{and there are}} outcrops of Lewisian, Dalradian and Moine metamorphic rocks with histories similar to their equivalents on the Scottish mainland. There are also Old Red Sandstone deposits and granite intrusions. The most distinctive features are the ultrabasic ophiolite, peridotite and gabbro on Unst and Fetlar, which are remnants of the Iapetus Ocean floor.|$|E
5|$|Crickets are {{relatively}} defenceless, soft-bodied insects. Most species are nocturnal {{and spend the}} day hidden in cracks, under bark, inside curling leaves, under stones or fallen logs, in leaf litter, or in {{the cracks in the}} ground that develop in dry weather. Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground <b>and</b> <b>fold</b> in their antennae to conceal their presence. Some of these burrows are temporary shelters, used for a single day, but others serve as more permanent residences and places for mating and laying eggs. Crickets burrow by loosening the soil with the mandibles and then carrying it with the limbs, flicking it backwards with the hind legs or pushing it with the head.|$|E

5|$|There are {{fourteen}} extant {{families of}} the order Testudines, an order of reptile commonly known as turtles, tortoises and terrapins. The testudines {{are some of the}} most ancient reptiles alive, with only the tuataras considered more primitive. There are approximately 300 extant species and 97 genera of testudines, split into two suborders: the Cryptodirans and the Pleurodirans. The distinction between these two suborders is based on the mode in which they cover their head and neck. The Pleurodirans, also called the side-necked turtles, have long necks, <b>and</b> <b>fold</b> them sideways to align them with the shell. The Pelomedusidae and Chelidae are the only extant families of pleurodires. The Cryptodirans pull their neck straight back to conceal their head within the shell. The Carettochelyidae, Cheloniidae, Chelydridae, Dermatemydidae, Dermochelyidae, Emydidae, Kinosternidae, Testudinidae and Trionychidae are all cryptodires, although the ability to retract the head has been lost in the sea turtles (Cheloniidae and Dermochelyidae). A third order, the Paracryptodirans, are extinct.|$|E

25|$|In newt {{and general}} {{amphibian}} embryos, cell division {{is not a}} driving role in morphogenesis. Newt embryo cells are much larger and exhibit egg pigmentation to distinguish cells from each other. The newt neural plate doubles in length, decreases in apical width, and increases in thickness. The plate edges rise dorsally <b>and</b> <b>fold</b> toward the midline to form the neural tube. The apical surface area decreases.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two layers}} of mesoderm; intraembryonic and extraembryonic. As the intraembryonic layer grows laterally, it becomes {{continuous}} with the extraembryonic layer, forming the chorion (contributing to the blood supply). At the same time during embryonic development, the ectoderm begins to thicken <b>and</b> <b>fold</b> upward, forming the neural folds, which eventually meet to form the neural tube and neural crest. Because these two events occur {{at roughly the same}} time in embryological development, abnormalities found in this syndrome can involve not only the ectodermal cells, but also disruption to development in the mesectodermal layer constituted by the neural crest.|$|E
40|$|Distributions {{of protein}} {{families}} <b>and</b> <b>folds</b> in genomes are highly skewed, having {{a small number}} of prevalent superfamiles/superfolds and a large number of families/folds of a small size. Why are the distributions of protein families <b>and</b> <b>folds</b> skewed? Why are there {{only a limited number of}} protein families? Here, we employ an information theoretic approach to investigate the protein sequence-structure relationship that leads to the skewed distributions. We consider that protein sequences <b>and</b> <b>folds</b> constitute an information theoretic channel and computed the most efficient distribution of sequences that code all protein folds. The identified distributions of sequences <b>and</b> <b>folds</b> are found to follow a power law, consistent with those observed for proteins in nature. Importantly, the skewed distributions of sequences <b>and</b> <b>folds</b> are suggested to have different origins: the skewed distribution of sequences is due to evolutionary pressure to achieve efficient coding of necessary folds, whereas that of folds is based on the thermodynamic stability of folds. The current study provides a new information theoretic framework for proteins that could be widely applied for understanding protein sequences, structures, functions, and interactions...|$|R

25|$|Following the {{exposure}} {{that came from}} A Walk to Remember, Switchfoot attracted attention from multiple record labels, and ultimately signed with Columbia Records/SonyBMG. Their major label debut, The Beautiful Letdown, under Columbia Records/Red Ink, represented the band's evolution from the predominantly lo-fi, indie rock sound of their early albums, toward a more layered, synth-influenced sound that helped launch the band to mainstream popularity. This shift sonically {{could be attributed to}} the fact that the album was the first to include keyboardist Jerome Fontamillas, formerly of industrial bands Mortal <b>and</b> <b>Fold</b> Zandura. Fontamillas had been touring with Switchfoot since 2000, following the release of Learning to Breathe.|$|E
25|$|This {{pattern in}} turn {{suggests}} the following method of creating models of iterations of the Heighway dragon curve by folding {{a strip of}} paper. Take a strip of paper <b>and</b> <b>fold</b> it in half to the right. Fold it in half again to the right. If the strip was opened out now, unbending each fold to become a 90 degree turn, the turn sequence would be RRL i.e. the second iteration of the Heighway dragon. Fold the strip in half again to the right, and the turn sequence of the unfolded strip is now RRLRRLL â€“ the third iteration of the Heighway dragon. Continuing folding the strip in half {{to the right to}} create further iterations of the Heighway dragon (in practice, the strip becomes too thick to fold sharply after four or five iterations).|$|E
