500|$|After {{the success}} of his 2002 {{documentary}} Spellbound, Jeffrey Blitz was encouraged by his agents to write fiction because of the larger revenue brought in by fiction films. Blitz began to piece together a story that had come to him while he had been filming Spellbound: [...] "I kept thinking, what if we met <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>that</b> was just an amazing lover of words? What if we met <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>that</b> was lured into the spelling bee because {{he was in love with}} a girl?" [...] He had compiled a mental list of characters who he expected to encounter while making Spellbound, several of whom eventually became Rocket Science characters. Despite claiming to be [...] "allergic" [...] to autobiographical films, he was persuaded by HBO executive Maud Nadler to write a screenplay based on his own adolescence when he told her that, as a teenager, he joined his school's debate team to try and overcome his stutter. He says that he is uninterested in teen films, so [...] "the only way I was going to do a teen movie is if I felt like I could try to be more honest about what the actual experience of being a teenager is like." [...] He was aware of the clichés in teen films, so [...] "tried to undo them without wrecking them". Blitz wrote the script [...] "off and on" [...] over a year in between stints of commercial directing. He cites directors Hal Ashby and Billy Wilder as his greatest influences with their absurdist comedies, though critics have suggested influence from Gary Larson, Alexander Payne, Mike Nichols and Wes Anderson—the latter despite Blitz specifically saying, [...] "I did not want a Wes Andersen [...] snowglobe artificial world." ...|$|E

500|$|At the 2012 NBA Draft Combine, White {{measured}} at 6'8" [...] {{and had the}} widest hands——of any player participating. [...] According to Iowa State head coach Fred Hoiberg, [...] "He's such a unique player and plays such a different style that it's difficult to compare him to anybody". [...] When asked who in the NBA he would compare White to. Kentucky Wildcats coach John Calipari {{had this to say}} about White: [...] "Here's <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>that</b> would rather pass and get 15 assists than score a basket. It's amazing. And he plays tough, and he's got huge hands. So you'd better grab the ball with two because he'll grab it with one." [...] He was able to bench-press 185 pounds 30 times in pre-combine workouts. [...] That would have been a NBA combine record had he bench pressed. White was drafted by the Houston Rockets on June 28, 2012 with the 16th selection. He was represented by Andrew Vye and Andy Miller of the ASM Sports as his agents.|$|E

500|$|A {{parody of}} the song {{performed}} by Bieber caused controversy after a video of it was released by the entertainment news website TMZ on June 4, 2014. The video featured a then 14-year-old Bieber, parodying the song with the main lyric [...] "One less lonely nigger," [...] and {{that if he were}} to kill [...] "one less lonely nigger," [...] he'd be [...] "part of the KKK." [...] Sources stated that Bieber told his mentors, musical artists Usher and Will Smith, about the video after it was filmed, after which Usher showed Bieber some historically racist videos in an effort to teach him about the degradational intent of the word [...] "nigger" [...] and other racial epithets. On June 5, 2014, the rapper and president of Young Money Entertainment, Mack Maine chose to defend Bieber after the racist remarks. He said Maine says Bieber is still family for the artists on Young Money, according to TMZ. The publication reports that Maine says Bieber has black friends and that [...] "Bieber does not have a slave mentality." [...] According to Mack Maine, Bieber [...] "treats his people with respect." [...] Mack Maine has said that he brought up a racial joke in his past.

[...] Mack Maine also confirms that Young Money and Justin Bieber are slated to continue working together. On the same day, Bieber made an announcement of his apology for the parody.|$|E
2500|$|Benjamin McKenzie portrays Ryan Atwood, {{a troubled}} {{teenager}} from Chino who {{is brought into}} the privileged community of Newport Beach, California after his mother, Dawn Atwood, throws him out of their family home. Ryan is subsequently taken in by his public defender, Sandy Cohen. He forms fast bonds with the entire Cohen family, especially Sandy's son Seth, {{as well as an}} extreme attachment to the girl next door, Marissa Cooper. Ryan slowly finds himself a place within his new materialistic society, and makes of the most of his situation by not only completing high school, but also continuing on to university. Casting director Patrick Rush found the role of Ryan Atwood particularly hard to cast and only invited Benjamin McKenzie to an audition after Fox had made them aware of the young actor after his unsuccessful audition for a UPN sitcom. Rush said, [...] "When Benjamin [...] came in, he wasn't physically what Josh had envisioned, but he inhabited the character unlike anyone we had seen. I think that the character of Ryan is <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>that</b> always seems a little lost and has a sense of mystery and danger; Benjamin has all those qualities." [...] Chad Michael Murray was originally offered the role of Ryan Atwood but turned it down for the lead role of Lucas Scott on One Tree Hill.|$|E
2500|$|By 1918, Lloyd and Roach {{had begun}} to develop his {{character}} beyond an imitation of his contemporaries. Harold Lloyd would move away from tragicomic personas, and portray an everyman with unwavering confidence and optimism. The persona Lloyd referred to as his [...] "Glass" [...] character (often named [...] "Harold" [...] in the silent films) was a much more mature comedy character with greater potential for sympathy and emotional depth, and was easy for audiences of the time to identify with. The [...] "Glass" [...] character {{is said to have}} been created after Roach suggested that Harold was too handsome to do comedy without some sort of disguise. To create his new character Lloyd donned a pair of lensless horn-rimmed eyeglasses but wore normal clothing; previously, he had worn a fake mustache and ill-fitting clothes as the Chaplinesque [...] "Lonesome Luke". [...] "When I adopted the glasses," [...] he recalled in a 1962 interview with Harry Reasoner, [...] "it more or less put me in a different category because I became a human being. He was <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>that</b> you would meet next door, across the street, but at the same time I could still do all the crazy things that we did before, but you believed them. They were natural and the romance could be believable." [...] Unlike most silent comedy personae, [...] "Harold" [...] was never typecast to a social class, but he was always striving for success and recognition. Within the first few years of the character's debut, he had portrayed social ranks ranging from a starving vagrant in From Hand to Mouth to a wealthy socialite in Captain Kidd's Kids.|$|E

60|$|It was <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>that</b> he {{had come}} to roast. But it was a kid opened out, made quite flat, and speared like a flat fan on a long iron stalk. It was a really curious sight. And it must have taken some doing. The whole of the skinned kid was there, the head curled in against a shoulder, the stubby cut ears, the eyes, the teeth, the few hairs of the nostrils: and the feet curled curiously round, like an animal that puts its fore-paw over its ducked head: and the hind-legs twisted indescribably up: and all {{skewered}} flat-wise upon the long iron rod, so that it was a complete flat pattern. It reminded me intensely of those distorted, slim-limbed, dog-like animals which figure on the old Lombard ornaments, distorted and curiously infolded upon themselves.
