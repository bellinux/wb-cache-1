We have been working on two <b>air</b> <b>interfaces,</b> one of which is based on inter-cell synchronous CDMA and the other on inter-cell asynchronous CDMA. Both <b>air</b> <b>interfaces</b> are designed to accommodate chip rates of 4. 196, 8. 192, and 16. 384 Mcps (chip per second) corresponding to radio frequency (RF) bandwidths of 5, 10, and 20 MHz, respectively. These two <b>air</b> <b>interfaces</b> are being implemented in the first and second testbed systems, respectively. In this paper, we focus on the first phase system, especially on the design and implementation of wideband CDMA modem...|$|R

30|$|No works can {{be found}} on the {{specific}} issue of interference between LDR WPAN and HDR WPAN colocated <b>air</b> <b>interfaces,</b> which is the focus of this paper.|$|R
30|$|These situations, where {{multiple}} <b>air</b> <b>interfaces</b> {{are positioned}} {{in the same}} multimode device, {{are referred to as}} colocated <b>air</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Colocated <b>air</b> <b>interfaces</b> create an increased level of system interference which can affect data transfer significantly by reducing goodput. This paper addresses the issue of the interference management among Low Data Rate (LDR, few kbps) and High Data Rate (HDR, hundreds of Mbps) WPAN <b>air</b> <b>interfaces</b> that are in close-proximity (colocated at a maximum distance of 10 [*]cm) [1]. Recently, the issue of interference evaluation and management between Ultra Wideband (UWB) and narrowband systems has received a wide interest. An overview of coexistence issues between UWB and narrowband wireless communication systems is provided in [2]. The authors of [3] propose an analytical framework for coexistence in networks composed of both narrowband and UWB wireless nodes, based on fundamental tools from stochastic geometry. In [4] the bit error probability is analyzed for the case of a single UWB pulse interfering with a binary phase shift keying narrowband system, in an AWGN channel. Furthermore, many works {{can be found on the}} analysis of interference and on interference avoidance mechanisms for uncoordinated wireless devices that transmit over the same unlicensed bands [5, 6]. However, most of these works focus on the coexistence of short range wireless networks (i.e., Bluetooth, 802.15. 1 and 802.15. 4) and Wireless Local Area Networks (i.e., IEEE 802.11) [7].|$|R
40|$|Future-generation {{cellular}} wireless systems, transporting {{high bit}} rates in non-ideal radio propagation environments, must be robust to severe frequency selective multipath. Further requirements include moderate terminal and base station hardware costs, high spectral efficiency, and scalability {{of the cost}} of terminals with respect to their maximum bit rate capabilities. Reconfigurable <b>air</b> <b>interfaces,</b> based on frequency domain transmission and reception methods, best meet these requirements, by adaptively selecting the uplink and downlink modulation and multiple access scheme that is most appropriate for the channel, interference, traffic and cost constraints. This approach also leads to a general unified framework for possible <b>air</b> <b>interfaces.</b> 1. Introduction-Requirement...|$|R

The paper considers IEEE 802.15. 4 and ECMA- 368 standards. The authors propose a collaborative coexistence mechanism called alternating wireless activity (AWA) for managing the simultaneous operation in close proximity of these two complementary WPANs. It is shown that the AWA mechanism achieves perfect coexistence by controlling and synchronizing the access to the network of the HDR and LDR <b>air</b> <b>interfaces.</b>|$|R
