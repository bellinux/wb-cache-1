40|$|To {{decrease}} the operating cost of flue gas purification technologies based on carbon-based materials, the adsorption and regeneration performance of low-price semi-coke and <b>activated</b> <b>coke</b> were compared for SO 2 and NO removal in a simulated flue gas. The functional {{groups of the}} two adsorbents before and after regeneration were characterized by a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, and were quantitatively assessed using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) coupled with FTIR and acid-base titration. The results show that semi-coke had higher adsorption capacity (16. 2 % for SO 2 and 38. 6 % for NO) than <b>activated</b> <b>coke</b> because of its higher content of basic functional groups and lactones. After regeneration, the adsorption performance of semi-coke decreased {{because the number of}} active functional groups decreased and the micropores increased. Semi-coke had better regeneration performance than <b>activated</b> <b>coke.</b> Semi-coke had a larger SO 2 recovery of 7. 2 % and smaller carbon consumption of 12 % compared to <b>activated</b> <b>coke.</b> The semi-coke carbon-based adsorbent could be regenerated at lower temperatures to depress the carbon consumption, because the SO 2 recovery was only reduced a small amount.

No significant carbon isotope fractionation was observed during the equilibrium vaporization of aqueous solution of toluene and trichloroethylene (Slater et al. 1999), the soil adsorption of BTEX (Harrington et al. 1999) and the sorption of halogenated hydrocarbon compounds (trichloroethene, cis-dichloroethene, vinylchloride) and BTEX compounds onto <b>activated</b> carbon, lignite <b>coke,</b> and lignite (Schüth et al. 2003).

When the subjects were informed of the brand names the consumers preferred Coke, and only <b>Coke</b> <b>activated</b> the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, suggesting that drinking the Coke brand is rewarding beyond simply the taste itself. More subjects preferred Coke when they knew it was Coke than when the taste testing was anonymous, which demonstrates the power of branding to influence consumer behavior. There was also significant activation in the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex when subjects knew they were drinking Coke. These brain structures are known to play a role in memory and recollection, which indicates they are helping the subjects to connect their present drinking experience to previous brand associations. The study proposes that there are two separate processes contributing to consumer decision making: the ventromedial prefrontal cortex responds to sensory inputs and the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex recall previous associations to cultural information. According to the results of this study, the Coke brand has much more firmly established itself as a rewarding experience.|$|R
40|$|Each day {{large volumes}} of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) are being {{produced}} during the extraction of bitumen in oil sands industry in northern Alberta. OSPW contains different polyaromatic hydrocarbons which {{not only are the}} major source of toxicity in OSPW, but also create operational problems such as corrosion of the equipment during bitumen recovery process. Therefore, these compounds need to be removed prior to the recycle of the OSPW. In this research, petroleum coke (PC) as an abundant, inexpensive adsorbent was selected as an adsorbent for recovery of chemicals from OSPW. The surface area and adsorption capacity of PC were increased through several processes such as KOH activation, surface modification, and optimization. The Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology were employed to optimize KOH activation parameters for the production of <b>activated</b> petroleum <b>coke</b> (APC). APC adsorbent with a BET surface area of 1726 m 2 /g and total pore volume of 0. 85 cc/g was produced at the optimum activation conditions (KOH/coke mass ratio of 3. 0, activation temperature 790 °C, and activation time 3. 47 hr). The produced APC at optimum condition was tested in batch and bench scale continuous adsorption column for adsorption of model compounds and treatment of OSPW. Furthermore, two different amination processes including a single stage treatment with ammonia gas at an elevated temperature and a two-step treatment of nitration followed by reduction were adopted. The results showed an excellent adsorption capacity for the model NAs and OSPW at pH= 4. 0. Ammonia treatment was more effective on improvement of adsorption capacity than the nitration followed by reduction method. The results of the PLS model shows that the pH of the solution and the NH 3 surface modification are the most important contributors that affect the adsorption capacity of APC. The result of this study provides an effective treatment method for OSPW by using APC. The TOC of OSPW could be reduced by 96 percent after a two steps treatment including pH adjustment and adsorption by APC.

As part of this effort, small-scale production of activated carbon was produced from Fort Union lignite. A conceptual design of a commercial activated carbon production plant was drawn, and a market assessment was performed to determine likely revenue streams for the produced carbon. Activated carbon was produced from lignite coal in both laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactors and in a small pilot-scale rotary kiln. The EERC was successfully able to upgrade the laboratory-scale activated carbon production system to a pilot-scale rotary kiln system. The activated carbon produced from North Dakota lignite was superior to commercial grade DARCO{reg_sign} FGD and Rheinbraun's HOK <b>activated</b> <b>coke</b> product with respect to iodine number. The iodine number of North Dakota lignite-derived activated carbon was between 600 and 800 mg I{sub 2 }/g, whereas the iodine number of DARCO FGD was between 500 and 600 mg I{sub 2 }/g, and the iodine number of Rheinbraun's HOK <b>activated</b> <b>coke</b> product was around 275 mg I{sub 2 }/g. The EERC performed both bench-scale and pilot-scale mercury capture tests using the activated carbon made under various optimization process conditions. For comparison, the mercury capture capability of commercial DARCO FGD was also tested. The lab-scale apparatus is a thin fixed-bed mercury-screening system, which {{has been used by}} the EERC for many mercury capture screen tests. The pilot-scale systems included two combustion units, both equipped with an electrostatic precipitator (ESP). Activated carbons were also tested in a slipstream baghouse at a Texas power plant. The results indicated that the activated carbon produced from North Dakota lignite coal is capable of removing mercury from flue gas. The tests showed that activated carbon with the greatest iodine number was superior to commercial DARCO FGD for mercury capture. The results of the activated carbon market assessment indicate an existing market for water treatment and an emerging application for mercury control. That market will involve both existing and new coal-fired plants. It is expected that 20 % of the existing coal-fired plants will implement activated carbon injection by 2015, representing about 200, 000 tons of annual demand. The potential annual demand by new plants is even greater. In the mercury control market, two characteristics are going to dominate the customer's buying habit-performance and price.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} in use of reducing agents in blast furnace (BF) ironmaking has been significantly improved over the years. At most blast furnaces, auxiliary fuels are injected to replace some of the coke. To further reduce carbon consumption, prevention of losses and modification of raw materials or process conditions are required. In this study coke properties, their development during the descent in the BF under different process conditions, contribution to off-gas dust as well as modifications of coke aiming for reduced energy consumption in the BF have been investigated. The changes in chemical composition of coke ash, mineral phase developments and coke participation in the endothermic gasification reaction with CO 2 and coke graphitisation were studied. Also, {{in order to reduce}} the losses of material in the off-gas, a characterisation of the off-gas dust and its connection to BF conditions and coke property development in the BF has been made. Coke properties have been studied in the laboratory and in samples taken out from different parts of the LKAB Experimental BF (EBF®) during varied operational set-ups. Properties of coke from the BF high-temperature region were studied via tuyere core-drilling of samples from the EBF and an industrial-scale BF. The results showed that the coarser dry flue dust is mechanically formed. Coke fines originating from the upper shaft dominates the coarser fractions. Gasification in the shaft has a negligible effect on the high quality coke used in the EBF. The finer dust fraction, sludge, consists mainly of chemically formed spherical particles in the order of < 1 μm. Gaseous compounds formed in the BF high-temperature area precipitate from the ascending gas as the temperature decreases. Flow conditions in the top of the BF and the fluidisation properties of fine particles determine out-flow of off-gas dust. Low off-gas temperatures, and thus lower off-gas velocities, are favourable for low flue dust amounts expelled from the blast furnace. The strength and reactivity of coke at high temperature, measured in the standardised test, was compared with coke from basket samples charged into the EBF. Coke reactivity in the EBF is considerably lower for all coke types studied compared to coke studied in the CRI/CSR test. Due to higher gasification in the laboratory test the ash content is higher in that test. However, gaseous components in the EBF, such as recirculated alkali, contribute to changed ash composition in BF coke. Laboratory studies using fixed bed reactor (FBR) and a thermo gravimetric analyser (TGA) on the same material, original as well as Fe- and Ca-activated coke samples, identified the effects on reaction behaviour and were the basis for selection of the potentially best method for <b>activating</b> nut <b>coke</b> to achieve higher reactivity with CO 2 when charged into iron-bearing layers. All types of Fe- and Ca-containing activation agents used increase the apparent reaction rates for coke with low reactivity and contents of catalytic components in the ash. Activation with a solution of Fe(NO 3) 3 has the strongest effect on the reactivity, followed by slurry of Ca(OH) 2 and iron oxides (Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4) in descending order. Use of a non-specific weight loss in TGA as a basis for apparent reaction rate demands measurements in a temperature interval free from other reactions involving the activation agents. The reaction rate is reduced when CO is present in the reaction gas. Aiming for a method for determination of thermal history in BF samples the correlation between temperature and coke graphitisation was studied using three different data processing methods for removing the influence from overlapping peaks during X-ray diffraction measurements. Structural changes in coke during heat treatment are accompanied by chemical transformations in ash compounds and changed the pattern of disturbing peaks. Key ash phases were SiO 2 and mullite. At high temperatures (~ 1500 °C) the SiO 2 peaks are reduced in magnitude and finally disappear to be replaced with SiC peaks. The graphitisation was correlated with temperature and time in argon atmosphere and the impact from hot metal and slag was investigated. The graphitisation degree in coke samples from the EBF raceway and hearth was estimated and the evolution of structural order was found to be suitable in order to estimate the thermal history of coke in blast furnaces.

40|$|The {{catalytic}} conversion of hydrocarbons over zeolites {{has been applied}} in large scale petroleum-refining processes. However, there is always formation and retention of heavy by-products, called coke, which causes catalyst deactivation. This deactivation {{is due to the}} poisoning of the acid sites and/or pore blockage. The formation of coke on hydrocarbon processing catalysts is of considerable technological and economic importance {{and a great deal of}} work has been carried out to this study. The main aim of this work is to understand the deactivation of zeolite catalysts as a result of coke deposition. The deactivation by coke of USHY zeolite was investigated during {{catalytic conversion}} of hydrocarbons – 1 -pentene, n-heptane and ethylbenzene – as representatives of olefins, paraffins and aromatics respectively, at different reaction temperatures, time-on-streams and composition. Three novel techniques, coke classification, thermogravimetric method for characterising coke precursors and indirect temperature programmed desorption (TPD) for catalyst acid sites characterisation were developed to further study catalyst deactivation mechanism. Product distribution, coke formation, characterisation of coke precursors, as well as the role of strong acid sites on hydrocarbon reactions are presented and discussed. During catalytic reactions of 1 -pentene over USHY zeolite, cracking and hydride transfer were the predominant reactions in initial stage which deactivated rapidly allowing isomerisation to become the main reaction afterwards. Deactivation studies showed that coke formation was very strong initially which is in good correlation with the initial rapid deactivation. The hydrogen freed during this initial time from the formation of high C/H ratio coke components contributed to the formation of hydride transfer products. The amount of coke precursors decrease with increasing reaction temperature due to the higher desorption of coke precursors into gas phase while hard coke amount increased with temperature as expected from an <b>activated</b> process. The <b>coke</b> amount formed was not proportional to the reactant feed composition, because of a strong pseudo-zeroth- order initial coking on strong acidic sites. The thermogravimetric method provides insight into the chemical character of coke precursor components in terms of the mode of their removal and allows further classification of coke precursors into small and large coke precursors. The concentration and strength of acid sites of coked catalysts were studied by the TPD methodology. Besides, characterisation of coke precursors was also revealed. The initial deactivation preferentially on strong acid sites is very fast. The concentration of free acid sites is inversely correlated well with the total concentration of coke rather than individual coke groups. Coke precursors tend to be more stable at higher reaction temperatures. Furthermore, by selectively poisoning strong acid sites of USHY zeolite, it shows conclusively that strong acid sites are responsible for cracking and hydride transfer reactions as well as strong coke formation while weak acid sites can only catalyse double bond isomerisation. ...|$|R

This incinerator is internally divided into primary, secondary, intermediate and heat exchanger chambers. In the primary chamber, the infectious meat is burned using 95 – 200 kW burner, the combustion products are then passed through the intermediate chamber, the secondary chamber, and eventually through the heat exchanger chamber. A 50 kW burner is installed in the secondary chamber to complete the combustion of CO and to destruct the dioxin. Fresh air is then introduced to the flue gases to dilute the emission concentrations and to reduce the flue gas temperature. The flue gas is finally cleaned using an <b>activated</b> <b>coke</b> filter which is installed before the incinerator stack.

Die Ergebnisse der bisher veröffentlichten wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten sind sehr unterschiedlich, wenn nicht sogar widersprüchlich. In dieser Arbeit wird, anhand der Messung von NO-Durchbruchskurven und thermischen Desorptionsspektren, die Adsorption und Reaktion von Stickstoffmonoxid an Aktivkohlen und -koksen in Anwesenheit von Sauerstoff und Wasserdampf untersucht. Zur Durchführung der experimentellen Untersuchungen wird eine Versuchsanlage, bestehend aus einer Vorrichtung zur Gasgemischaufbereitung, einem Festbettreaktor und einer Gasanalytik, konzipiert und aufgebaut. Die Untersuchungen erfolgen bei Temperaturen zwischen 100 und 150 °C. Die NO-, O 2 - und H 2 O-Konzentrationen werden anhand der Rauchgaszusammensetzung kohlegefeuerter Kraftwerke gewählt. Die experimentellen Untersuchungen konzentrieren sich auf die Verwendung einer Aktivkohle aus Ölpalmschalen, die in einem Drehrohrreaktor am Institut für Thermische Energietechnik der Universität Kassel hergestellt wurde. Die experimentellen Ergebnisse zeigen, dass während des Prozesses NO-Adsorption, -Reduktion und -Oxidation, NO 2 -Bildung, -Adsorption und -reduktive Desorption, H 2 O-Adsorption sowie O 2 -Vergasung gleichzeitig stattfinden. Bei niedrigen Temperaturen werden die NO 2 -Bildung und die Adsorption bevorzugt. Die NO-Reduktion läuft über adsorbiertes NO mit CO 2 - und CO-Bildung. Durch O 2 -Vergasung werden aktive freie Cf-Plätzen für die NO-Reaktion und -Adsorption gebildet. Wasserdampf wird an der Aktivkohle adsorbiert und belegt aktive Plätze für diese Prozesse. Aus den experimentellen Ergebnissen werden kinetische und Gleichgewichtsparameter der NO-Sorption bestimmt.

For the execution of the experimental work a pilot plant composed of a device for the preparation of the gas mixture, a fix bed reactor and a gas analysis system was designed and constructed. The experiments are made at temperatures between 100 and 150 °C. The concentrations of NO, O 2 and H 2 O correspond to the composition of the flue gas from coal fired power plants. The experimental work focus on the use of an activated carbon from oil palm shells, which were produced in a rotary kiln at the Institut for Thermal Engineering at the University of Kassel. The experimental results show, that during the process occurs simultaneously adsorption, reduction and oxidation of NO; formation, adsorption and reductive desorption of NO 2, adsorption of H 2 O and gasification mit O 2. The creation of NO 2 and the adsorption process are at low temperature favoured. The reduction of NO takes place over adsorbed NO with formation of CO 2 and CO.

Das PKA-Pyrolyseverfahren ist durch folgende Verfahrensschritte gekennzeichnet: -Aufbereitung der Einsatzstoffe auf die fuer den Prozess erforderliche Koernung und Aushaltung ferromagnetischer Bestandteile - Pyrolyseanlage zur thermischen Behandlung der Einsatzstoffe und Spaltung in die Produkte Pyrolysereststoff sowie Pyrolyserohgas in der indirekt beheizten Pyrolysetrommel bei ca. 550 C -Crackung der im Pyrolyserohgas enthaltenen Kohlenwasserstoffe bei Temperaturen von 110 bis 1200 C - Gasreinigung, bestehend aus einer mehrstufigen Gaswaesche, Trockenentschwefelung und Aktivkoksfilter. Durch ein umfangreiches Probenahme-, Mess- und Analysenprogramm wurden die Verfahrensschritte Pyrolyse und Gascrackung und das Gesamtverfahren untersucht. Auf dieser Grundlage sind Aussagen zur Stoff- und Energiebilanzierung, zur Schadstoffreduzierung und zu Emissionen moeglich. Die Ergebnisse dienen als Basis fuer die Projektierung von thermischen Entsorgungsanlagen. Weiterhin wurden wertvolle Erkenntnisse zu Verbesserungen der Gascrackung und Staubabscheidung aus dem Spaltgas gewonnen. So wurde der Gascracker mit Steinkohlenkoksbefuellung durch eine kokslose Technologie ersetzt und der Staub im Spaltgas mit einem Schlauchfilter abgeschieden. Auf Grund der Variabilitaet der stofflichen Zusammensetzung der Einsatzstoffe sind auch die Bilanzergebnisse sehr unterschiedlich. Bei allen Einsatzstoffen wurde eine starke Reduzierung der Massen und Volumina der festen Reststoffe erreicht und ein energetisch verwertbares Reingas produziert. Die Verwertung der Pyrolysereststoffe durch Hochtemperaturvergasung ist nicht Gegenstand dieses Foerderprojektes. (orig.) Within the {{framework}} of this sponsored project, the following materials were pyrolysed at the pyrolysis plant operated by DBI Rohstoff- und Anlagentechnik GmbH for research purposes at Freiberg: PAH-contaminated wood, shredded car parts, aluminium-containing plastic waste, used carpets, and paint shop wastes. The PKA pyrolysis technique {{is characterized by the}} following process steps: conditioning of materials to the grain size required for the process and elimination of ferromagnetic components, pyrolysis for thermal treatment and for breaking a material up into the products pyrolysis residue and crude pyrolysis gas in an indirectly heated pyrolysis drum at approximately 550 C, cracking of hydrocarbons contained in the crude pyrolysis gas at temperatures between 110 and 1200 C, and flue gas cleaning by means of of multi-stage gas scrubbing, dry desulfurization and <b>activated</b> <b>coke</b> filters. In a comprehensive sampling, measuring and analysis program, the process steps pyrolysis and gas cracking and the overall process were investigated. On this basis statements can be made regarding material and energy budgets, pollutant control, and emissions. The results serve as a basis for the planning of thermal disposal plants. Furthermore, valuable knowledge was obtained on how to enhance gas cracking and dust precipitation from the cracked gas. Thus, the gas cracker with hard-coal-coke filling was replaced by a cokeless unit, and dust in the cracked gas was precipitated by means of a tube filter. On account of the variability of composition of the materials used, budgeting results vary greatly, too. For all materials used, the mass and volume of solid residues could be substantially reduced; the clean gas produced can be used as an energy source. Processing of the pyrolysis residues by high-temperature gasification is not the object of this research project. (orig.)
