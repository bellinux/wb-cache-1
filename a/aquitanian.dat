5|$|Basque, not an Indo-European language, {{survived in}} the region of the Pyrenees. The people of southwestern Gaul and northeastern Hispania (roughly present-day Aquitaine and Navarre) were {{regarded}} by Julius Caesar as ethnically distinct from the Celts, and the <b>Aquitanian</b> language they spoke was Vasconic like Basque, judging from place names. The Aquitani adopted Latin under Roman rule.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Baroni Urbani {{described}} a new Baltic fossil species, {{of which he}} named it Prionomyrmex janzeni. After examining specimens of the new species and Nothomyrmecia macrops, Baroni Urbani stated that the newly described species and Nothomyrmecia macrops {{belong to the same}} genus (Prionomyrmex), in which he synonymised Nothomyrmecia as a genus and treated the tribe Prionomyrmecini as a subfamily, known as Prionomyrmecinae. Prior to this, John S. Clark, the original author who described Nothomyrmecia, noted that the genus was similar in appearance to Prionomyrmex; both the heads and mandibles were identical, but the nodes were different. As the mandibles of Prionomyrmex are similar to that of Nothomyrmecia, this suggests that they are intermediate to each other. This classification was short-lived, as Nothomyrmecia was separated and treated as a valid genus from Prionomyrmex by Dlussky & Perfilieva in 2003, on the base of the fusion of an abdominal segment. Other studies published in the same year came to the same conclusions of Dlussky & Perfilieva, and the subfamily Prionomyrmecinae would later be treated as a tribe in Myrmeciinae. However, Baroni Urbani would treat the tribe as a subfamily again in both his 2005 and 2008 publications, suggesting additional evidence in favor of his former interpretation as opposed to that of Ward and Brady's arguments. In 2012, P. wappleri was described by Gennady M. Dlussky, based on a fossilised worker from the Late Oligocene, <b>Aquitanian</b> stage. This subsequent report that described new fossil myrmecines accepted the classification of Archibald et al. and Ward & Brady without comment on the views of Baroni Urbani.|$|E
25|$|The {{city was}} plundered by the troops of Abd er Rahman in 732 after {{storming}} the fortified city and overwhelming the <b>Aquitanian</b> garrison. Duke Eudes mustered a force ready {{to engage the}} Umayyads outside Bordeaux, eventually taking on them in the Battle of the River Garonne somewhere near the river Dordogne, described as taking a heavy death toll. After Duke Eudes's defeat, the <b>Aquitanian</b> duke could still save part of its troops and keep his grip on Aquitaine after the Battle of Poitiers.|$|E

25|$|According to some theories, Basques may be {{the least}} assimilated remnant of the Paleolithic {{inhabitants}} of Western Europe (specifically those of the Franco-Cantabrian region known as Azilian) to the Indo-European migrations. Basque tribes were mentioned by Greek writer Strabo and Roman writer Pliny, including the Vascones, the Aquitani, and others. There is considerable evidence to show their Basque ethnicity in Roman times {{in the form of}} place-names, Caesar's reference to their customs and physical make-up, the so-called <b>Aquitanian</b> inscriptions recording names of people and gods (approx. 1st century, see <b>Aquitanian</b> language), etc.|$|E
25|$|He either {{assumed that}} the Franks would {{not come to the}} aid of their <b>Aquitanian</b> rivals, or did not care, and he thus failed to assess their {{strength}} before invasion.|$|E
25|$|In 735, the <b>Aquitanian</b> duke Hunald led a {{rebellion}} {{after his father}} Eudes's death, at which Charles responded by sending an expedition that captured and plundered Bordeaux again, {{but it was not}} retained for long. The following year, the Frankish commander descended again over Aquitaine, but clashed in battle with the Aquitanians and left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745, Aquitaine faced yet another expedition by Charles' sons Pepin and Carloman against Hunald, the <b>Aquitanian</b> princeps (or duke) strong in Bordeaux. Hunald was defeated, and his son Waifer replaced him, who in turn confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).|$|E

25|$|In {{historical}} times, around 300 BC it was {{the settlement}} of a Celtic tribe, the Bituriges Vivisci, who named the town Burdigala, probably of <b>Aquitanian</b> origin. The name Bourde is still {{the name of a}} river south of the city.|$|E
25|$|Most French {{people are}} of Celtic (Gauls) origin, with an {{admixture}} of Latin (Romans) and Germanic (Franks) groups.

25|$|Abdul Rahman next {{proceeded}} through Gascony {{all the way}} to Bordeaux, {{capturing the}} city. Odo engaged Abdul Rahman on the Garonne River at the Battle of Bordeaux, but was defeated. The Umayyads looted the rich monasteries of northern Aquitaine before resuming their march towards Tours, a town said to be holding abundant wealth and treasures. This plundering gave Odo enough time to re-organise his <b>Aquitanian</b> troops and warn Charles Martel of the impending danger.|$|E
50|$|The Frankish {{troops were}} beaten by the <b>Aquitanians</b> {{near the river}} Agout and were forced to retreat without {{significant}} accomplishments.

25|$|When Philip {{heard of}} Richard's deal with Emperor Henry, {{he decided to}} {{consolidate}} his gains by forcing Richard's regents to concede with a treaty at Mantes in July 1193. Firstly, John was handed back his estates in both England and France. Secondly, Count Ademar was to be released and no <b>Aquitanian</b> vassals were to be charged or penalised. Thirdly, Richard was to give four major castles to Philip and pay the cost of garrisoning them, along with other compensation.|$|E
25|$|However, {{when the}} Muslim first crossed the Pyrenees, Aquitaine was {{actually}} an independent realm under duke Odo's {{leadership and the}} Gothic Septimania remained out of Frankish rule. Odo, who was Charles's southern rival, had struck a peace treaty after the Frankish civil wars in Neustria and Austrasia, and garnered much popularity and the Pope's favour for his victory on the 721 Battle of Toulouse against the Moors. On {{the eve of the}} Muslim expedition north (731), Charles Martel crossed the Loire and captured the <b>Aquitanian</b> city of Bourges, while Odo re-captured it briefly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|With {{the rise}} of the Carolingians and Pepin the Short's war on Aquitaine, the Duchy of Aquitaine led by Waifer was {{defeated}} and further ensued Frankish penetration into the duchy. The Basques (Vascones, Wascones) of the Duchy of Vasconia, one of the mainstays of the <b>Aquitanian</b> army, submitted to Pepin in 766 and 769, but the territory south of the Garonne remained largely unscathed and self-governed. However, as of 778 Charlemagne expanded Frankish takeover of Aquitaine to present-day Gascony, by appointing trusted Franks, Burgundians and Church officials in key regional positions and establishing counties, such as Fezensac, Bordeaux, and Toulouse, on the left bank of the Garonne.|$|E
5000|$|This {{campaign}} {{focuses on}} the Roman acquisition of the Iberian Peninsula, starting with the Carthaginian landings by Hamilcar Barca. Tribes active in this campaign (besides Romans) are the Kallaikes, Astures, Vettones, Lusitanes, Keltikes, Baitures, Karthaginians, Turdetanes, Bastetanes, Oretanes, Karpetanes, Vakkaies, Kantabres, Vaskones, Keltiberes, Edetanes, Kontestanes, Arsetanes, Ilurgetes and <b>Aquitanians.</b>|$|R
50|$|Their {{historical}} territory today corresponds {{very well}} with {{the extension of the}} Biscayan dialect of the Basque language, however it is discussed if the Caristii were actually <b>Aquitanians,</b> related to the Vascones, or if they were Celts, related to tribes such as the Cantabri and Celtiberians and that later suffered a Basquisation.|$|R
50|$|Charlemagne {{decided to}} {{organize}} a regional subkingdom {{in order to keep}} the <b>Aquitanians</b> in check and to secure the southern border of the Carolingian Empire against Muslim incursions. In 781, his three-year-old son Louis was crowned king of Aquitaine, under the supervision of Charlemagne's trustee William of Gellone, and was nominally in charge of the incipient Spanish March.|$|R
25|$|Louis VII died in 1180 and was {{succeeded by}} his 15-year-old son, crowned as Philip II. The {{man who would}} later become arguably his main rival, Richard, had {{administered}} Aquitaine since 1175 but his policy of centralisation of the <b>Aquitanian</b> government had grown unpopular {{in the eastern part}} of the Duchy, notably Périgord and Limousin. Richard was further unliked in Aquitaine due to his apparent disregard for Aquitaine's customs of inheritance, as shown by events in Angoulême in 1181. If Richard was unpopular in Aquitaine though, Philip was equally unliked by his contemporaries with comments describing him as: astute, manipulative, calculating, penurious and ungallant ruler.|$|E
25|$|A direct frontal assault, such as took Arles, using rope ladders and rams, {{plus a few}} catapults, {{simply was}} not {{sufficient}} to take Narbonne without horrific loss {{of life for the}} Franks, troops Charles felt he could not lose. Nor could he spare years to starve the city into submission, years he needed to set up the administration of an empire his heirs would reign over. In addition, he faced strong opposition from regional lords such as the patrician Maurentius, from Marseille, who revolted against the Frankish leader. Moreover, the <b>Aquitanian</b> duke Hunald threatened his lines of communication with the north, so deciding him to withdraw from Septimania and destroy several strongholds (Béziers, Agde, etc.). He left Narbonne therefore, isolated and surrounded, and his son would return to conquer it for the Franks.|$|E
25|$|In the 720s, the al-Andalus {{governors}} launched several sa'ifa raids into Aquitaine, {{but were}} severely defeated by Duke Odo the Great of Aquitaine at the Battle of Toulouse (721). However, after crushing Odo's Berber ally Uthman ibn Naissa {{on the eastern}} Pyrenees, Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi led an expedition north across the western Pyrenees and defeated the <b>Aquitanian</b> duke, who in turn appealed to the Frankish leader Charles Martel for assistance, offering to place himself under Carolingian sovereignty. At the Battle of Poitiers in 732, the al-Andalus raiding army was defeated by Charles Martel. In 734, the Andalusi launched raids to the east, capturing Avignon and Arles and overran much of Provence. In 737, they climbed up the Rhône valley, reached as far as Burgundy. Charles Martel of the Franks, {{with the assistance of}} Liutprand of the Lombards, invaded Burgundy and Provence and expelled the raiders by 739.|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem that}} arises {{in the study}} of the {{language}} of the Vascones is the lack of direct classic records regarding the language spoken by this people, with the exception of a vague description by Strabo and Pomponius Mela, or the description made by Julius Caesar on the language of the <b>Aquitanians</b> in his work Commentarii de Bello Gallico.|$|R
50|$|Basques as an Iberian subgroup: Based on {{occasional}} use {{by early}} Basques of the Iberian alphabet and Julius Caesar's {{description of the}} <b>Aquitanians</b> as Iberians. Apparent similarities between the undeciphered Iberian language and Basque have also been cited, but this fails {{to account for the}} fact that attempts so far to decipher Iberian using Basque as a reference have failed.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the country}} where the {{original}} <b>Aquitanians</b> lived came to be named Novempopulania (nine peoples) in the late years of the Roman Empire and Early Middle Ages (up to the 6th century), the number of tribes varied (about 20 for Strabo, but comparing with the information of other classical authors such as Pliny, Ptolemy and Julius Caesar, the total number were 32 or 33): ...|$|R
500|$|The oldest-known sestina is [...] "Lo ferm voler qu'el cor m'intra", written around 1200 by Arnaut Daniel, a troubadour of <b>Aquitanian</b> origin; {{he refers}} to it as [...] "cledisat", meaning, more or less, [...] "interlock". Hence, Daniel is {{generally}} considered the form's inventor, though {{it has been suggested}} that he may only have innovated an already existing form. Nevertheless, two other original troubadouric sestinas are known, the best known being [...] "Eras, pus vey mon benastruc" [...] by Guilhem Peire Cazals de Caortz; there are also two contrafacta built on the same end-words, the best known being Ben gran avoleza intra by Bertran de Born. These early sestinas were written in Old Occitan; the form started spilling into Italian with Dante in the 13th century; by the 15th, it was used in Portuguese by Luís de Camões.|$|E
500|$|P. wappleri was {{described}} in 2012 by Russian palaeoentomologist Gennady M. Dlussky of the Moscow State University, from a fossilised holotype worker found in Germany from the <b>Aquitanian</b> stage 29 to 30 million years ago. The specimen is currently housed in the Institut für Paläontologie at the University of Bonn, North Rhine-Westphalia. Dlussky coined the specific epithet [...] wappleri from the surname [...] "Wappler", as he named the ant after German palaeoentomologist Torsten Wappler. The estimated body length of P. wappleri is [...] long, and the head is 1.35 times longer than the total width of it. The eyes are small and oval shaped, located in {{the upper part of}} the head, which is four times as long as the eyes. The mandibles are nearly three-quarters the length of the head; P. wappleri differs from P. longiceps and P. janzeni due to the apex of the clypeal lobe being pointed instead of round, and the first segment of the flagellum is only half the length of the second segment. Before the discovery of P. wappleri, extinct Myrmeciinae ants were only found from Eocene deposits. This suggests that the subfamily was still present in Europe during the Late Oligocene.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Occitan" [...] was attested around 1300 as [...] "occitanus", a {{crossing}} of oc and aquitanus (<b>Aquitanian).</b>|$|E
