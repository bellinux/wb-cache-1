50|$|The group {{velocity}} vg is {{often thought of}} as the velocity at which energy or information is conveyed along the wave. In most cases this is true, and the {{group velocity}} can be {{thought of as the}} signal velocity of the waveform. In some unusual circumstances, called cases of anomalous dispersion, the rate of change of the index of refraction with respect to the wavelength changes sign (becoming negative), in which case it is possible for the group velocity to exceed the speed of light (vg > c). Anomalous dispersion occurs, for instance, where the wavelength of the light is close to an <b>absorption</b> <b>resonance</b> of the medium. When the dispersion is anomalous, however, group velocity is no longer an indicator of signal velocity. Instead, a signal travels at the speed of the wavefront, which is c irrespective of the index of refraction. Recently, it has become possible to create gases in which the group velocity is not only larger than the speed of light, but even negative. In these cases, a pulse can appear to exit a medium before it enters. Even in these cases, however, a signal travels at, or less than, the speed of light, as demonstrated by Stenner, et al.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Guided-Mode Resonance (GMR) {{effects in}} {{transparent}} periodic gratings possess {{a number of}} remarkable phenomena. GMRs exhibit strong features in the optical spectrum, i. e., dips, peaks, cusps, and may attain extremely high Q-factors. In some cases, resonant reflection with the efficiency equal to unity can be observed. We demonstrate that the introduction of small losses in the structure can drastically modify its optical response by causing strong <b>absorption</b> <b>resonances.</b> Unity reflection in loss-free structures can be almost completely converted into unity absorption peaks as soon as very small losses are introduced. Even thin absorbing films in the structure (or in its vicinity) can lead to such strong resonant <b>absorption</b> effects. The <b>resonances</b> may exhibit a negligible spectral shift, but a significant variation in the magnitude when losses are slightly altered, which is highly attractive for sensor and switch applications. Absorption peaks experience a resonant behavior with respect to both frequency and material losses. We show that {{the width of the}} absorption peaks decreases and approaches the width of the reflection peaks, as losses decrease. Thus, high-Q resonances can be observed. The <b>absorption</b> <b>resonances</b> also possess strong angular dependence; they may split and significantly increase in magnitude for a slightly inclined incidence.
