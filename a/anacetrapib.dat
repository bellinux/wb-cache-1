Epidemiological studies propose HDL-C as a possible candidate. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) transfers cholesteryl esters from atheroprotective HDL to atherogenic (V) LDL. The CETP inhibitor <b>anacetrapib</b> decreases (V) LDL-C by ∼ 15 - 40 % and increases HDL-C by ∼ 40 - 140 % in clinical trials. We evaluated {{the effects of a}} broad dose range of <b>anacetrapib</b> on atherosclerosis and HDL function, and examined possible additive/synergistic effects of <b>anacetrapib</b> on top of atorvastatin in APOE* 3 Leiden.

Our data clearly indicated that in the liver, CETP is exclusively expressed by F 4 / 80 +Ly 6 C-Clec 4 f+Vsig 4 + macrophages that represent resident, rather than immature macrophages. Next, we showed that the HDL response to the inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide is mediated by hepatic macrophages via down regulation of CETP expression in the liver that causes an increase in the level of HDL-C.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity affects HDL metabolism was investigated using agents that selectively target CETP (dalcetrapib, torcetrapib, <b>anacetrapib).</b> In contrast with torcetrapib and <b>anacetrapib,</b> dalcetrapib requires cysteine 13 to decrease CETP activity, measured as transfer of cholesteryl ester (CE) from HDL to LDL, and does not affect transfer of CE from HDL 3 to HDL 2. Only dalcetrapib induced a conformational change in CETP, when added to human plasma in vitro, also observed in vivo and correlated with CETP activity. CETP-induced pre-β-HDL formation in vitro in human plasma was unchanged by dalcetrapib ≤ 3 µM and increased at 10 µM.

40|$|Background: Secondary {{prevention}} of coronary events {{in patients with}} known CHD and dyslipidemia has traditionally been focused on decreasing LDL-C {{through the use of}} statins. However, significant risk remains in individuals whose LDL-C has been optimized but HDL-C remains low.

At week 52, <b>anacetrapib</b> reduced mean LDL-C concentration from 3 · 3 mmol/L (SD 0 · 8) to 2 · 1 mmol/L (0 · 8; percentage change 36 · 0 % [95 % CI - 39 · 5 to - 32 · 5] compared with an increase with placebo from 3 · 4 mmol/L (1 · 2) to 3 · 5 mmol/L (1 · 6; percentage change 3 · 7 % [- 1 · 2 to 8 · 6], with a difference in percentage change between <b>anacetrapib</b> and placebo of - 39 · 7 % (95 % CI - 45 · 7 to - 33 · 7; p < 0 · 0001). The number of cardiovascular events was increased in patients given <b>anacetrapib</b> compared with those given placebo (4 [2 %] of 203 vs none [0 %] of 102; p= 0 · 1544), but the proportion with adverse events leading to discontinuation was similar (12 [6 %] of 203 vs five [5 %] of 102). In patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, treatment with <b>anacetrapib</b> for 1 year was well tolerated and resulted in substantial reductions in LDL-C concentration. Whether this change leads to a reduction of cardiovascular events will be answered in an outcome study. Merck & Co, In...|$|E
40|$|Marta A Miyares, Kyle DavisPharmacy Department, Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, FL, USAAbstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is {{responsible}} for significant morbidity and mortality within the United States and worldwide. Although targeting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) {{in the prevention of}} CVD {{has been shown to be}} effective, evidence exists to indicate that significant cardiovascular (CV) risk remains in patients receiving 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) &ndash; a risk that may be correlated with low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Among the various tactics under investigation to increase HDL-C, inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) appears the most adept to raise these levels. Although torcetrapib, a CETP inhibitor, demonstrated significant beneficial changes in HDL-C and LDL-C after 12 months of therapy when coadministered with atorvastatin, patients in the torcetrapib arm experienced a rise in mortality, including increased risk of death from CV and non-CV causes as well as a significant rise in major CV events. Later studies established that the adverse effects of torcetrapib were produced from molecule-specific off-target effects and not to the mechanism of CETP inhibition. These untoward outcomes have not been detected with <b>anacetrapib,</b> the third of the CETP inhibitors to enter Phase III trials. Furthermore, treatment with <b>anacetrapib</b> revealed both a statistically significant decrease in LDL-C and increase in HDL-C over placebo. While the place in therapy of niacin and fibrates to reduce CV events is currently in question secondary to the Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL Cholesterol/High Triglyceride and Impact on Global Health Outcomes and the Action to Control CV Risk in Diabetes trials, the ongoing large-scale, randomized&ndash;placebo, controlled-outcomes study with <b>anacetrapib</b> coadministered with statin treatment will not only test the hypothesis if CETP inhibition lowers residual CV risk but will also provide insight as to which patient subgroups might benefit the most from <b>anacetrapib</b> despite aggressive therapy with statins.

40|$|Hyperaldosteronism and {{hypertension}} were unexpected {{side effects}} observed in trials of torcetrapib, a cholesteryl ester-transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor that increases high-density lipoprotein. Given that CETP inhibitors are lipid soluble, accumulate in adipose tissue, and have binding sites for proteins involved in adipogenesis, and that adipocytes {{are a source}} of aldosterone, we questioned whether CETP inhibitors (torcetrapib, dalcetrapib, and <b>anacetrapib)</b> influence aldosterone production by adipocytes. Studies were performed using human adipocytes (SW 872), which express CETP, and mouse adipocytes (3 T 3 -L 1), which lack the CETP gene. Torcetrapib, dalcetrapib, and <b>anacetrapib</b> increased expression of CYP 11 B 2, CYP 11 B 1, and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, enzymes involved in mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid generation. These effects were associated with increased reactive oxygen species formation. Torcetrapib, dalcetrapib, and <b>anacetrapib</b> upregulated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-γ, important in adipogenesis, but only torcetrapib stimulated production of chemerin, a proinflammatory adipokine. To determine mechanisms whereby CETP inhibitors mediate effects, cells were pretreated with inhibitors of Nox 1 /Nox 4 [GKT 137831; 2 -(2 -chlorophenyl) - 4 -[3 -(dimethylamino) phenyl]- 5 -methyl- 1 H-pyrazolo[4, 3 -c]pyridine- 3, 6 (2 H, 5 H) -dione], Nox 1 (ML 171 [2 -acetylphenothiazine]), mitochondria (rotenone), and STAT 3 (S 3 I- 201 [2 -hydroxy- 4 -(((4 -methylphenyl) sulfonyloxy) acetyl) amino) -benzoic acid]). In torcetrapib-stimulated cells, Nox inhibitors, rotenone, and S 3 I- 201 downregulated CYP 11 B 2 and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and reduced aldosterone. Dalcetrapib and <b>anacetrapib</b> effects on aldosterone were variably blocked by GKT 137831, ML 171, rotenone, and S 3 I- 201. In adipocytes, torcetrapib, dalcetrapib, and <b>anacetrapib</b> inhibit enzymatic pathways responsible for aldosterone production through Nox 1 /Nox 4 - and mitochondrial-generated reactive oxygen species and STAT 3. CETP inhibitors also influence adipokine production. These processes may be CETP independent. Our findings identify novel adipocyte-related mechanisms whereby CETP inhibitors increase aldosterone production. Such phenomena may contribute to hyperaldosteronism observed in CETP inhibitor clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|A model-based {{strategy}} {{was used to}} inform the early clinical development of <b>anacetrapib,</b> a novel cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor under development {{for the treatment of}} hyperlipidemia. The objectives of this model-based approach were to enable bridging variable pharmacokinetic effects, differences among formulations used in development, and to identify an appropriate dose for the phase III confirmatory program. Nonlinear mixed effects PK/PD models were initially developed based on data obtained from multiple phase I studies and later were updated with data from a phase IIb study. The population pharmacokinetic model described differences between the liquid-filled capsule used in phase I and phase IIb and the hot-melt extruded (HME) tablet formulation introduced in phase III, allowing for bridging of the two formulations, and quantified the complex relationship of apparent <b>anacetrapib</b> bioavailability with subject meal intake. Proportional Emax models quantified the relationships between <b>anacetrapib</b> trough concentration and lipoprotein effects (LDL-C and HDL-C), with covariate effects of study population (normal volunteers vs. patients), and co-administration with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (“statin”). The interaction between <b>anacetrapib</b> and atorvastatin suggested pharmacological independence, i. e., that when given together, each agent exerts the same proportional lipid effect observed from monotherapy. Clinical trial simulation was used to examine the robustness of the effects to random dietary indiscretion, and found that the results were robust as long as patients generally adhered to a low-fat diet. These results allowed the selection of the 100  mg dose with the HME formulation for phase III development even though this dose and formulation were not specifically studied in a phase IIb trial...|$|E

Statins have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events by 25 %– 40 % in a dose-dependent fashion; yet additional therapies are needed to reduce vascular disease progression and acute thrombotic events.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Cholesteryl ester {{transfer}} protein (CETP) -inhibiting drugs effectively raise HDL cholesterol. In 2007, the CETP inhibitor torcetrapib unexpectedly showed increased fatality and cardiovascular events, possibly related to increased {{blood pressure and}} aldosterone levels caused by torcetrapib. Since then, novel CETP inhibiting drugs have been investigated. This review will discuss {{the safety of the}} CETP-inhibiting drugs. Recent findings The novel CETP inhibitors dalcetrapib, evacetrapib and <b>anacetrapib</b> did not show harmful effects on blood pressure or aldosterone levels. Ultrasound brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation, carotid MRI and F- 18 -fluordeoxyglucose PET imaging studies, showed that dalcetrapib therapy had neither harmful nor beneficial effects on endothelial function, atherosclerosis progression, or vessel wall inflammation. Recently, the clinical endpoint study investigating dalcetrapib was announced to be terminated early, after the second interim analysis showed that dalcetrapib lacked clinically meaningful efficacy. Summary Dalcetrapib, evacetrapib and <b>anacetrapib</b> did not show the harmful effects on aldosterone and blood pressure that were exhibited by torcetrapib, indicating that CETP inhibition is well tolerated. So far CETP inhibition did not show beneficial effects on clinical outcome.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Because {{high-density}} lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are {{inversely related to}} cardiovascular disease (CVD), raising HDL-C levels would seem intuitively valuable. However, the recent failure of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor torcetrapib to decrease CVD has raised doubts regarding HDL-C raising in general and CETP inhibition in particular for CVD prevention. We briefly discuss the complexity of HDL metabolism, caveats of CETP inhibition, possible mechanisms for torcetrapib 2 ̆ 7 s failure, and the potential utility of other CETP inhibitors. RECENT FINDINGS: Torcetrapib likely failed because of off-target effects, since other CETP inhibitors, such as dalcetrapib (JTT- 705 /R 1658) or <b>anacetrapib</b> (MK- 0859), do not increase blood pressure, a specific pressor effect of tocetrapib {{that appears to be}} CETP-independent. In small human trials of short duration, <b>anacetrapib</b> and dalcetrapib appear to improve the lipoprotein profile without obvious adverse effects, so far. SUMMARY: The relationship between HDL metabolism, pharmacologic CETP inhibition, and atherosclerosis requires further elucidation. There seems to be sufficient evidence that evaluation of CETP inhibitors such as dalcetrapib and <b>anacetrapib</b> should proceed, if cautiously, since it remains uncertain whether the increased CVD risk with torcetrapib was related to agent-specific off-target effects or more generally to CETP inhibition as a mechanism to raise HDL...|$|E
