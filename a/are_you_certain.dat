You have been very good; you have shown the sympathy of a true friend. But you cannot possibly understand how this blow has fallen on Me. I am crushed. Madame Pratolungo!" [...] (he appealed to me, in my corner); [...] "Mrs. Finch!" [...] (he appealed to his wife, in her corner)--"I am crushed. There is no other word to express it but the word I have used. Crushed." [...] He stopped {{in the middle of}} the room. He looked expectantly at me--he looked expectantly at his wife. His face and manner said plainly, [...] "If both these women faint, I shall consider it a natural and becoming proceeding on their parts, after what I have just told them." [...] I waited for the lead of the lady of the house. Mrs. Finch did not roll prostrate, with the baby and the novel, on the floor. Thus encouraged, I presumed to keep my seat. The rector still waited for us. I looked as miserable as I could. Mrs. Finch cast her eyes up reverentially at her husband, as if she thought him the noblest of created beings, and silently put her handkerchief to her eyes. Mr. Finch was satisfied; Mr. Finch went on. [...] "My health has suffered--I assure you, Madame Pratolungo, MY health has suffered. Since this sad occurrence, my stomach has given way. My balance is lost--my usual regularity is gone. I am subject--entirely through this miserable business--to fits of morbid appetite. I want things at wrong times--breakfast {{in the middle of the}} night; dinner at four in the morning. I want something now!" [...] Mr. Finch stopped, horror-struck at his condition; pondering with his eyebrows fiercely knit, and his hand pressed convulsively on the lower buttons of his rusty black waistcoat. Mrs. Finch's watery blue eyes looked across the room at me, in a moist melancholy of conjugal distress. The rector, suddenly enlightened after his consultation with his stomach, strutted to the door, flung it wide open, and called down the kitchen stairs with a voice of thunder, [...] "Poach me an egg!" [...] He came back into the room--held another consultation, keeping his eyes severely fixed on me--strutted back in a furious hurry to the door--and bellowed a counter-order down the kitchen-stairs, [...] "No egg! Do me a red herring!" [...] He came back for the second time, with his eyes closed and his hand laid distractedly on his head. He appealed alternately to Mrs. Finch and to me. [...] "See for yourselves--Mrs. Finch! Madame Pratolungo!--see for yourselves what a state I am in. It's simply pitiable. I hesitate about the most trifling things. First, I think I want a poached egg--then, I think I want a red herring--now I don't know what I want. Upon my word of honor as a clergyman and a gentleman, I don't know what I want! Morbid appetite all day; morbid wakefulness all night--what a condition! I can't rest. I disturb my wife at night. Mrs. Finch! I disturb you at night. How many times--since this misfortune fell upon us--do I turn in bed before I fall off to sleep? Eight times? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>certain</b> of it? Don't exaggerate! <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>certain</b> you counted! Very well: good creature! I never remember--I assure you, Madame Pratolungo, I never remember--such a complete upset as this before. The nearest approach to it was some years since, at my wife's last confinement but four. Mrs. Finch! was it at your last confinement but four? or your last but five? Your last but four? Are you sure. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>certain</b> you are not misleading our friend here? Very well: good creature! Pecuniary difficulties, Madame Pratolungo, were at the bottom of it on that last occasion. I got over the pecuniary difficulties. How am I to get over this? My plans for Oscar and Lucilla were completely arranged. My relations with my wedded children were pleasantly laid out. I saw my own future; I saw the future of my family. What do I see now? All, so to speak, annihilated at a blow. Inscrutable Providence!" [...] He paused, and lifted his eyes and hands devotionally to the ceiling. The cook appeared with the red herring. [...] "Inscrutable Providence"--proceeded Mr. Finch, a tone lower. [...] "Eat it, dear," [...] said Mrs. Finch, [...] "while it's hot." [...] The rector paused again. His unresting tongue urged him to proceed; his undisciplined stomach clamored for the herring. The cook uncovered the dish. Mr. Finch's nose instantly sided with Mr. Finch's stomach. He stopped at [...] "Inscrutable Providence"--and peppered his herring.|$|E
5000|$|A vivid {{display of}} Eulenburg's anti-Semitism {{occurred}} in October 1895 when he reluctantly attended a Jewish charity concert in Vienna. In a dispatch {{back to the}} Kaiser, Eulenburg complained {{that he was the}} [...] "sole Aryan" [...] in the entire concert hall and stated his ears were pained to hear of [...] "the indescribable mishmash of German spoken with Austrian, Bohemian and Hungarian accents with international cliquishness"." [...] Eulenburg went on to write of his disgust of the [...] "drooping and enormously crooked noses", [...] "bandy knees", [...] "noses like tapirs", [...] "fat lips", [...] "prominent cheekbones", [...] "eye teeth like a walrus's", [...] "slanted eyes like slits", [...] "gaping jaws with hollow teeth", and the [...] "exposed and sweaty shoulders" [...] of the Jewish women in their evening night-gowns. Eulenburg wrote that since the Jews all paid their respects to a [...] "Jewish greybeard" [...] that this proved the old Jew [...] "must had slaughtered and eaten many Christian children, since two dozen long yellow teeth protruded from his ghastly maw" [...] (it is not clear in repeating the blood libel if Eulenburg was making an anti-Semitic joke or if he really believed in the blood libel). Finally, Eulenburg concluded his report to the Kaiser that the [...] "badly behaved" [...] Jewish children at the concert were all repulsively ugly and that the only attractive Jew he saw at the concert was the lead singer, a young woman whom Eulenburg stated was more animal than human, albeit one who could sing very well for a Jew. Despite his anti-Semitism, during his time as Ambassador to Austria, Eulenburg engaged in a homosexual relationship with the Austrian banker Nathaniel Meyer von Rothschild who liked Eulenburg so much that when he died in 1905 he left Eulenburg one million krones in his will. Rothschild, who possessed great wealth was ostracized by the Austrian aristocracy because he was a Jew (the fact that he was also gay contributed to him feeling like an outsider), and he often paid aristocrats to be his friends, which is how he met Eulenburg. Eulenburg often proclaimed his hatred of Jews, but he was prepared to socialize with wealthy Jews provided that they were willing to pay well for the social prestige that they accrued by having such an illustrious man as Eulenburg in their social circle. The relative penury of his youth left Eulenburg with an insatiable desire for money, and despite his wealth, he was {{always on the lookout for}} chances to make more money. In 1897, Eulenburg's younger brother, Friedrich von Eulenburg, an army officer was charged with being a homosexual. His older brother tried his best to have the Kaiser stop the court-martial, but the Army was unwilling to do so. In 1900, Eulenburg wrote a long memo for the benefit of his social circle about the court-martial of his brother, writing that men like himself and his brother were always threatened with public disgrace, which ended with Eulenburg writing: [...] "Farewell, my friend! <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>certain</b> that you have understood the story correctly? Please read it once again I beg you! So that you understand completely that the path of our lives is crossed by terrible demons, and that we should raise our hands to God in supplication, begging him, begging him fervently to defend us from them, to defend our loved ones from them!". In 1898, scandal threatened Eulenburg when the wife of Kuno von Moltke, in a sealed deposition, filed for divorce on the grounds that her husband was more interested in having sex with Eulenburg than with her. Moltke promptly instructed his lawyer to settle the divorce in his wife's favor in exchange for her not making these accusations public. Axel [...] "Dachs" [...] von Varnbüler wrote to Moltke telling him not to worry about losing the favor of [...] "the One" [...] II saying: [...] "I'm sure I am not mistaken in thinking that your pain is sharpened because you cannot hide, keep at bay, all this ugliness from him, from the Liebchen II. But do not torment yourself unnecessarily about this -- he is man enough to put a stop to nasty gossip -- and he knows and loves you too well in your peculiarity to allow even the shadow of blame to fall upon you". After learning of Moltke's divorce, Wilhelm confronted Varnbüler, and demanded to know what was happening. According to Varnbüler in a letter written on 4 June 1898 to Moltke: [...] "The Liebchen accosted me in the Tiergarten the day before yesterday. After he duly admired my yellow boots and colour co-ordinated riding costume, he asked me [...] "Don't you know anything about Kuno? I can't get anything out of either him or Philly"". Varnbüler went on to write that Wilhelm used [...] "unrepeatably energetic expressions" [...] which indicated to Varnbüler [...] "that he was extremely well-informed and no longer retained any illusions"." ...|$|E

40|$|Based on Fairy Tales by the Brothers Grimm, Into the Woods is an {{intricate}} weaving of {{the tales of}} Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood and Rapunzel, with a brand new story about the Baker and his Wife. When you add an ugly Witch who always tells the truth and {{has the power to}} grant wishes, and a friendly Narrator to help the story along, it 2 ̆ 7 s an eclectic mix. The story appears to be happily resolved at intermission. Each of the main characters seems to have achieved their goals, or have they? As Cinderella 2 ̆ 7 s dead mother says to her: 2 ̆ 2 <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>certain</b> what you wish is what you want? 2 ̆ 2 Things and people are not always what they seem to be. In the second act as the characters {{have to deal with the}} consequences of their single-minded pursuit of their wishes, they are forced to come together in a communal effort to overcome the peril in which they find themselves. The show was filled with glorious music. The very first musical statement; was five single notes as the 2 ̆ 2 magic bean 2 ̆ 2 theme and they occurred throughout the show in various songs or to underscore scenes. They were also memorably inverted in the very last song in the show. The 2 ̆ 2 theme 2 ̆ 2 means that something magical can happen.
