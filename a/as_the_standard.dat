5|$|By the early-20th century, Dhaka {{projected}} itself <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> {{bearer of}} Muslim minorities in British India; {{as opposed to}} the heavily Hindu-dominated city of Calcutta. During the abortive Partition of Bengal in 1905, Dhaka became the short lived capital of Eastern Bengal and Assam. In 1906, the All India Muslim League was formed at the Ahsan Manzil, during a conference on liberal education hosted by Nawab Sir Khawja Salimullah. Bengal was reunited in 1911. The University of Dacca was established in 1921. DEVCO, a subsidiary of the Occtavian Steel Company, began widescale power distribution in 1930.|$|E
5|$|Despite these advances, {{movable type}} {{printing}} never gained {{the amount of}} widespread use in East Asia that woodblock printing had achieved since the Chinese Tang Dynasty in the 9th century. With written Chinese, the vast amount of written morpheme characters impeded movable type's acceptance and practical use, and was therefore seen as largely unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the European printing press, first invented by Johannes Gutenberg (1398–1468), was eventually wholly adopted <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> in China, yet the tradition of woodblock printing remains popular in East Asian countries still.|$|E

5|$|A delayed or {{deployable}} surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB) is a soft inflatable tube which {{is attached to}} a reel or spool line at one end, and is inflated by the diver under water and released to float to the surface, deploying the line as it ascends. This provides information to the surface that the diver is about to ascend, and where he is. This equipment is commonly used by recreational and technical divers, and requires a certain level of skill to operate safely. Once deployed, it can be used for the same purposes <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> surface marker and reel, and in the same way, but they are mostly used to signal the boat that the diver has started ascent or to indicate a problem in technical diving.|$|E
5|$|Drivers are {{not legally}} {{required}} to take field sobriety tests, although the results are admissible in court. The Alcotest has replaced the Breathalyzer <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> device for determining blood alcohol level. When a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample, and must warn {{the driver of the}} consequences of refusing a breath sample. In 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the breath sample refusal conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified of the law in a language that they understand. A person can be charged with DUI or breath refusal up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case the statute of limitations is 5 years.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, {{improvements}} in natural resource management techniques emerged, along with increased concerns about otter population declines in North America. Consequently, many wildlife management agencies developed strategies to restore or enhance otter populations, {{including the use}} of reintroduction projects. Since 1976, over 4,000 otters have been reintroduced in 21 U.S. states. All Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island and 29 U.S. states have viable populations that sustain annual harvests. Annual harvest numbers of northern river otters are similar for Canada and the United States, with most pelts being used in the garment industry. In the late 1970s, annual harvest in North America reached approximately 50,000 pelts, for a value of US$3 million. Otters are inadvertently harvested by traps set for beavers, and therefore management plans should consider both species simultaneously. While current harvest strategies do not pose a threat to maintaining otter populations, harvest may limit expansion of otter populations in some areas. Otter harvests correlate positively with the beaver harvests and with the average beaver pelt price from the preceding year. Fur of the river otter is thick and lustrous and is the most durable of Native American furs. River otter pelts are used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> for rating the quality of other pelts.|$|E

5|$|Family {{studies on}} {{schizophrenia}} were reviewed. That the disorder runs in families did not suggest it was genetically inherited, since cultural transmission occurs from parents to children. Twin and adoption studies were presented <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> methods to disentangle contributions from genes and the environment. Gottesman used a computer-based method for calculating {{the odds of}} becoming schizophrenic based on the many causes. The book examines the problems caused by schizophrenia for relatives of patients and for society at large, larger-scale ones exemplified by the eugenics policies of states such as Nazi Germany. Two final chapters cover molecular biology and neuroanatomy briefly. Newer methods of behavioral genetics being researched {{at the time of}} publication, such as linkage analysis which used the likelihood of neighboring genes being inherited together, were not covered.|$|E
5|$|Heliade inaugurated {{his series}} of {{proposals}} for reforming {{the language in}} 1828, when his work on Romanian grammar called for the Cyrillic script to be reduced to 27 letters, reflecting phonetic spelling (for this rule, Heliade cited {{the example of the}} Latin alphabet as used in Ancient Rome). Soon after, he began a campaign in favor of introducing Romance neologisms, which he wanted to adapt to Romanian spelling. By that time, Romanians in various regions had grown aware of the need to unify the varieties of Romanian and create a standard Romanian lexis: this notion was first supported by the Transylvanians Gheorghe Şincai and Petru Maior, whose proposal was to unite Romanians around the issue of the choice of liturgical language, both Orthodox and Greek-Catholic (see Transylvanian School). Heliade, who first proposed a language regulator (an idea which was to be employed in creating the Romanian Academy), expanded on this legacy, while stressing that the dialect spoken in Muntenia, which had formed the basis of religious texts published by the 16th century printer Coresi, serve <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> language.|$|E
5|$|In 1887 Michelson {{proposed}} {{the use of}} optical interferometers for the measurement of length, work which contributed to him being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1907. In 1952 the CIPM {{proposed the}} use of wavelength of a specific light source <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> for defining length, and in 1960 the CGPM accepted this proposal using radiation corresponding to a transition between specified energy levels of the krypton 86 atom as the new standard for the metre. By 1975, when the second had been {{defined in terms of}} a physical phenomenon rather than the earth's rotation and Einstein's assertion that the speed of light was constant, the CGPM authorised the CIPM to investigate the use of the speed of light {{as the basis for the}} definition of the metre. This proposal was accepted in 1983.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of the {{following}} year, steps began to make coin operation, via a nickel slot, part of {{the mechanics of the}} viewing system. By autumn 1892, the design of the Kinetoscope was essentially complete. The filmstrip, based on stock manufactured first by Eastman, and then, from April 1893 onward, by New York's Blair Camera Co., was 35 mm (1 3/8inches) wide; each vertically sequenced frame bore a rectangular image and four perforations on each side. Within a few years, this basic format would be adopted globally <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> for motion picture film, which it remains to this day. The publication in the October 1892 Phonogram of cinematographic sequences shot in the format demonstrates that the Kinetograph had already been reconfigured to produce movies with the new film.|$|E
5|$|Outside of {{the hurdles}} events, the steeplechase race {{is the other}} track and field event with obstacles. Just as the {{hurdling}} events, the steeplechase finds its origin in student competition in Oxford, England. However, this event was born as a human variation on the original steeplechase competition found in horse racing. A steeplechase event was held on a track for the 1879 English championships and the 1900 Summer Olympics featured men's 2500m and 4000m steeplechase races. The event was held over various distances until the 1920 Summer Olympics marked {{the rise of the}} 3000 metres steeplechase <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> event. The IAAF set the standards of the event in 1954, and the event is held on a 400m circuit that includes a water jump on each lap. Despite the long history of men's steeplechase in track and field, the women's steeplechase only gained World Championship status in 2005, with its first Olympic appearance coming in 2008.|$|E

The first three volumes chronicled {{the beginnings of the}} women's rights movement, including the years that Stone was active. Because of differences between Stone and Stanton that had been highlighted in the schism between NWSA and AWSA, Stone's place in history was marginalized in the work. The text was used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> scholarly resource on 19th-century U.S. feminism for much of the 20th century, causing Stone's extensive contribution to be overlooked in many histories of women's causes.|$|E
