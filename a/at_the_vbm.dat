40|$|Monolayer Tellurium (Te) or tellurene {{has been}} {{suggested}} by a recent theory as a new two-dimensional (2 D) system with great electronic and optoelectronic promises. Here we present an experimental study of epitaxial Te deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrate by molecular-beam epitaxy. Scanning tunneling microscopy of ultrathin layers of Te reveals rectangular surface cells with the cell size consistent with the theoretically predicted beta-tellurene, whereas for thicker films, the cell size is more consistent {{with that of the}} (10 - 10) surface of bulk Te crystal. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements show the films are semiconductors with the energy bandgaps decreasing with increasing film thickness, and the gap narrowing occurs predominantly at the valance-band maximum (VBM). The latter is understood by strong coupling of states <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> but a weak coupling at conduction band minimum (CBM) as revealed by density functional theory calculations.

40|$|Boron {{arsenide}}, the typically-ignored {{member of}} the III–V arsenide series BAs–AlAs–GaAs– InAs is found to resemble silicon electronically: its Γ conduction band minimum is p-like (Γ 15), not s-like (Γ 1 c), it has an X 1 c-like indirect band gap, and its bond charge is distributed almost equally on the two atoms in the unit cell, exhibiting nearly perfect covalency. The reasons for these are tracked down to the anomalously low atomic p orbital energy in the boron and to the unusually strong s–s repulsion in BAs relative to most other III–V compounds. We find unexpected valence band offsets of BAs with respect to GaAs and AlAs. The valence band maximum (VBM) of BAs is significantly {{higher than that of}} AlAs, despite the much smaller bond length of BAs, and the VBM of GaAs is only slightly higher than in BAs. These effects result from the unusually strong mixing of the cation and anion states <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>VBM.</b> For the BAs–GaAs alloys, we find (i) a relatively small (∼ 3. 5 eV) and composition-independent band gap bowing. This means that while addition of small amounts of nitrogen to GaAs lowers the gap, addition of small amounts of boron to GaAs raises the gap (ii) boron “semi-localized” states in the conduction band (similar to those in GaN–GaAs alloys), and (iii) bulk mixing enthalpies which are smaller than in GaN–GaAs alloys.

40|$|In {{succession}} to {{the first}} paper (arXiv 1406. 6204 v 5), the impurity-atom concentrations when the Fermi levels are either at the valence band maximum (VBM) or the conduction band minimum (CBM) were identified for diamond, cubic boron nitride (cBN), and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) scheme using the local density approximation (LDA). In the present paper, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used instead of the LDA for exchange-correlation. The impurity atoms were B and N for diamond, Be, Si, and C for cBN, and Be for hBN; these impurity atoms were known in the first paper to form degenerate states by increased impurity-atom concentrations. The impurity-atom concentrations when the Fermi level was located either <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> or the CBM were as follows: (i) the B concentration was 0. 27 at. % in B-doped diamond, (ii) the N concentration was 0. 25 at. % in N-doped diamond, (iii) the concentration of Be substituting B was 0. 88 at. % in cBN, (iv) the concentration of Si substituting B was 0. 06 at. % in cBN, (v) the concentration of C substituting B was 0. 07 at. % in cBN, (vi) the concentration of C substituting N was 0. 88 at. % in cBN, and (vii) the concentration of Be substituting B was 1. 80 at. % in hBN. The values of (iv) and (v) were significantly smaller than the corresponding values in paper I, but it was attributed to the input parameters {{used in the present}} paper, hence it was concluded that the computed concentrations were not sensitive to the GGA used.

40|$|Speed of processing, theorized {{to be an}} {{important}} cognitive component of intelligence, is indexed by response speed on standardized cognitive ability tests. However, the term “processing speed” is also used to refer to “speed of information processing” during a cognitive task tapping early stages of processing, though these concepts arise from two different theoretical schools of thought. This study investigates the relationship between processing speed on higher-order cognitive tasks and information processing efficiency during early stages of processing. University of New Mexico undergraduate students (n= 101) completed a widely used IQ test, the WAIS-III, and an information processing task, the visual backward masking task (<b>VBM).</b> <b>The</b> <b>VBM</b> consists of a computer presentation of a target and masking stimuli and is used to tap into the amount of time information is accurately processed in the sensory register. Two measures gathered during <b>the</b> <b>VBM,</b> detection accuracy, and a psychophysiological measure of mental effort, pupillary dilation response, were used to index information processing efficiency. Both VBM detection accuracy and the pupillary response to <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> masking stimulus, which represents resources allocated to the task irrelevant stimuli, have been associated with IQ scores. Consistent with previous studies, <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> detection accuracy scores on the 83 ms and 117 ms stimulus onset asynchrony conditions were associated with various components of the WAIS-III; however, <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> pupillary dilation response had stronger relationships to WAIS-III components appears to have a stronger underlying factor of g. In addition, <b>the</b> shorter <b>VBM</b> stimulus onset asynchrony conditions were associated with WAIS-III performance measures while the longer conditions were associated with verbal measures. These results suggest that, while processing speed and information processing efficiency are similar constructs with strong relationships to IQ, they are separate constructs with different underlying factors of those relationships. <b>The</b> <b>VBM</b> physiological measure of pupillary dilation response may be a more stable measure of cognitive ability than <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> behavioral detection accuracy responses during this early information processing task.

40|$|GaN {{and related}} nitride {{compounds}} have found many applications in optoelectronic devices. Point defects introduce energy levels into the band gap and alter the electrical and optical properties of GaN. Previous studies focussed on studying point defects with density functional theory (DFT), periodic boundary conditions (PBC) and relatively inaccurate LDA energy functionals. We aim {{to improve on}} the defi�ciencies of this method by implementing a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) scheme, which has been specifically designed {{for the study of}} point defects; we use a hybrid functional and a formal charge scheme for the MM model. We o�ffer an explanation for why p-type doping is difficult to achieve in GaN; the exothermic formation energies of the Ga interstitial and N vacancy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> are thought to be the main cause. We suggest that the processes responsible for a variety of DLTS signals between 0. 18 - 0. 67 eV below the CBM may be due to Ga interstitial 3 +/ 2 +, 2 +/ 1 + transitions, N interstitials (1 +/ 0) and Ga vacancies (2 -/ 1 -, 3 -/ 2 -). We attribute the ODMR signal indicating a deep donor state 0. 7 eV below the conduction band to the N interstitial 0 / 1 - transition. Finally, our results support previous suggestions that Ga vacancies may be the cause of yellow luminescence in GaN. Further refi�nements of the model, especially improving the basis set, are recommended in the future, as well as a more detailed investigation into the causes of discrepancy between our model and PBC calculations. We use the MM model to study the properties of ternary alloys of AlN, GaN and InN, and to �find their thermodynamically stable con�figurations. Our results are in good agreement with PBC DFT calculations. These structures are not observed experimentally; we suggest that this is a growth phenomenon.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis is concentrated mostly around {{the properties of the}} Variational Boussinesq Model (<b>VBM).</b> <b>The</b> <b>VBM</b> is a model for waves above a layer of ideal fluid, which conserves mass, momentum, energy, and has decreased dimensionality compared to the full problem. It is derived from the Hamiltonian formulation via an approximation of the kinetic energy, and can provide approximate dis- persion characteristics. In particular, dispersive properties of a model are important for a large number of practical applications, especially if modelled waves have a broad spectrum. The most important assessment for a model is a comparison between results obtained from the model and experimental data. We show how well <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> performs in a few complex cases, such as focussing wave groups with broad spectra. The real-life experiments with this type of waves were performed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> facilities of the MARIN hydrodynamic laboratory (Maritime Research Institute Netherlands). In order to put the work into the context of existing research, we compare the obtained results to those of other models, in particular the AB-equation which is briefly discussed in the thesis as well. Having free parameters in <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> gives opportunities to optimize the parameters depending on the specifcs of the application. We explore possibilities of such optimization, interchanging norms in different optimization criteria. Then the question rises, which of these norms is the best? We come up with the novel kinetic energy optimization criterium that is natural for <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> and gives seemingly the best result in the considered test cases. Another important property from the practical viewpoint is how well a model simulates reflection. We study the reflective properties of <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> and compare them to previous results by other authors. We also derive and investigate an analytical reflection model of the WKB (Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin) type, whose performance is surprisingly good. For the numerical implementation of <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> we employ a Finite Element Method (FEM), and a pseudo-spectral method in case of the AB-equation.

Here, structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data collected from a large sample of BD and SCZ patients and healthy controls (HC) were analyzed in terms of gray matter volume (GMV) using both voxel based morphometry (VBM) and a region of interest (ROI) approach. The analysis was conducted on two datasets, Dataset 1 (802 subjects: 243 SCZ, 176 BD, 383 HC) and Dataset 2, a homogeneous subset of Dataset 1 (301 subjects: 107 HC, 85 BD and 109 SCZ).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel video {{denoising}} method based on adaptive thresholding and K-means clustering. In the proposed method the adaptive thresholding is applied rather than the conventional hard-thresholding of <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> 3 D method. The adaptive thresholding has a high ability to adapt and change according to the amount of noise. More specifically, hard-thresholding is applied on the higher noise areas while soft-thresholding is applied on the lower noise areas. Consequently, we can successfully remove the noise effectively and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time preserve the edges of the image, because the clustering approach saves more computation time and is more capable of finding relevant patches than the block-matching approach. So, the K-means clustering method in the final estimate in this paper is adopted instead of the block-matching method in <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> 3 D method in order to restrict the search of the candidate patches within the region of the reference patch and therefore improve the grouping. Experimental results emphasize the superiority of the new method over the reference methods in terms of visual quality, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Image Enhancement Factor (IEF).

30|$|For the In 3 d {{spectra of}} both the InN and the thin InN/BTO samples, {{additional}} low intensity higher-binding-energy components were required. These extra components are attributed to In-O bonding due to oxide contamination when InN is present <b>at</b> <b>the</b> surface [12], as shown in Figure 2 a. In the thin InN/BTO sample shown in Figure 2 c, they are attributed to In-O bonding <b>at</b> <b>the</b> InN/BTO interfaces, and/or inelastic losses to free carriers in the InN layer [13]. The CL peak attributed to In-N bonding locates at 443.67 ± 0.03 and 443.98 ± 0.03 eV for thick InN and thin InN/BTO, respectively, as shown in Figure 2 a, c. From Figure 2 b, it can be clearly seen that the Ti 2 p peak in the bulk BTO is not symmetric and consists of two components by careful Voigt fitting. The prominent one located at 457.12 ± 0.03 eV is attributed to the Ti emitters within the BTO substrate, which have six bonds to oxygen atoms. The other one shifting by ~ 2 eV to a lower binding energy is attributed to TiOx suboxides {{on account of the}} TiO-terminated BTO initial surface [14]. However, the Ti 2 p spectrum in the thin InN/BTO heterojunction is quite symmetric, indicating a uniform bonding state and the only peaks correspond to Ti-O bonds. It is interesting that the Ti 2 p peaks transform from asymmetry in bulk BTO to symmetry in the thin InN/BTO sample, as recently observed in the thin ZnO/BTO heterostructure [15]. <b>The</b> <b>VBM</b> value of bulk BTO is determined to be 1.49 ± 0.06 eV using the linear method. The Fermi energy level of an insulator is expected to be located {{in the middle of the}} forbidden energy gap, so <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> will be one-half of the band gap of insulators [16]. For BTO, <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> should be 1.55 eV calculated from the band gap of 3.1 eV [17], which is in good agreement with the measured value (1.49 ± 0.06 eV) in the present work. Using the same fitting methods mentioned above, <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> value for <b>the</b> thick InN lms can be determined to be 0.24 eV, as shown in Figure 1 e. Substituting the above values in Equation 1, the resulting VBO value is calculated to be 2.25 ± 0.09 eV.|$|R

Here, we expand upon this initial work to systematically investigate the effect of substitutional admixing on the energy levels of band edges. Density functional theory was used to survey potential admixing candidates that modify either the conduction band minimum (CBM) or valence band maximum (VBM). We considered two sets of compositions based on Lu$_ 3 $B$_ 5 $O$_{ 12 }$ where B = Al, Ga, In, As, and Sb; and RE$_ 3 $Al$_ 5 $O$_{ 12 }$, where RE = Lu, Gd, Dy, and Er.

40|$|AbstractThe high {{sensitivity}} and wide bandwidth of mammalian hearing {{are thought to}} derive from an active process involving the somatic and hair-bundle motility {{of the thousands of}} outer hair cells uniquely found in mammalian cochleae. To better understand this, a biophysical three-dimensional cochlear fluid model was developed for gerbil, chinchilla, cat, and human, featuring an active “push-pull” cochlear amplifier mechanism based on the cytoarchitecture of the organ of Corti and using the time-averaged Lagrangian method. Cochlear responses are simulated and compared with in vivo physiological measurements for the basilar membrane (BM) velocity, VBM, frequency tuning of the BM vibration, and Q 10 values representing the sharpness of the cochlear tuning curves. <b>The</b> <b>VBM</b> simulation results for gerbil and chinchilla are consistent with in vivo cochlea measurements. Simulated mechanical tuning curves based on maintaining a constant VBM value agree with neural-tuning threshold measurements better than those based on a constant displacement value, which implies that the inner hair cells are more sensitive to VBM than to BM displacement. The Q 10 values of <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> tuning curve agree well with those of cochlear neurons across species, and appear to be related in part to the width of the basilar membrane...|$|R

40|$|The Variational Boussinesq Model (VBM) for waves {{is based}} on the {{essential}} property that wave phenomena can be exactly described as a Hamiltonian system. In <b>the</b> <b>VBM,</b> <b>the</b> fluid potential in the expression of the kinetic energy is approximated by its value <b>at</b> <b>the</b> free surface plus a linear combination of vertical potential profiles with horizontal spatially dependent functions as coefficients. The vertical potential profiles are chosen a priori and determine completely the dispersive properties of the model. For signalling problems above varying bottom we show how to optimize the wave number of one or more Airy functions as vertical profiles, by minimizing the kinetic energy functional for the given influx signal. The performance of a finite element implementation with piecewise linear basis functions is investigated by comparing simulations with experimental data from MARIN hydrodynamic laboratory for bichromatic and irregular waves running over a sloping bottom. The conclusion is that this code is robust and remarkably accurate and efficient...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{acknowledged}} {{effectiveness of}} vinblastine, bleomycin, and methotrexate (VBM) chemotherapy {{in patients with}} early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma {{has been associated with}} conflicting toxicity reports. METHODS. One hundred forty-three patients were evaluated clinically and had favorable Stage IA or IIA Hodgkin lymphoma. Ninety-three patients were treated with <b>the</b> standard <b>VBM</b> schedule combined with extended-field radiotherapy (EFRT), leaving the choice of the therapeutic sequence free. Fifty subsequent patients were treated with a slightly modified VBM schedule (VbMp) combined with RT limited to involved fields (IF-RT) and delivered only after the end of chemotherapy. In the VbMp schedule, intervals between cycles were 21 days instead of 28 days, bleomycin doses were reduced, small doses of prednisone were given orally, and the interval before RT was prolonged. RESULTS. Clinical response was complete in 96 % of patients who were treated with VBM plus EF-RT and in 94 % of patients who were treated with VbMp plus IF-RT. Recurrence rates were nearly identical (12 % and 11 %, respectively) over necessarily different follow-up (91 months and 33 months, respectively). Hematologic toxicity was tolerable in both trials, and pulmonary side effects were moderate in the first trial and negligible in the second. On the whole, treatment was tolerated better when RT followed chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS. <b>The</b> <b>VBM</b> regimen was confirmed to be effective in patients with early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma. Administration of all cycles before RT improved tolerance; pulmonary toxicity probably is mitigated further by reduced bleomycin doses, mild prednisone therapy, and a more prolonged resting interval before RT. A slightly higher recurrence rate was expectable in <b>the</b> <b>VBM</b> plus IF-RT trial despite the actual intensification of vinblastine and methotrexate...|$|R
