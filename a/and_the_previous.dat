5|$|A three-disc {{edition of}} Casino Royale on DVD was {{released}} in the United Kingdom on 31 October 2008, coinciding with the cinema release of the sequel, Quantum of Solace (the following week in the United States). As well as features present from the 2007 release, the collector's edition contains an audio commentary, deleted scenes, featurettes and a storyboard-to-film comparison. A two-disc Blu-ray version also followed in late 2008, featuring additional supplementary materials, enhanced interactivity through BD-Live, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> version's 5.1 PCM soundtrack was replaced with a similar 5.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, {{the man and}} {{one woman}} walk into the woods {{together}} and masturbate each other while standing. The other woman, left at the car, becomes curious and follows them into the woods. Upon seeing them, she becomes sexually aroused and stimulates herself. Meanwhile, the man <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> woman have sex in the missionary position. Soon after, the other woman joins them and the man has sex with her doggy style. Later, they have a threesome, {{and one of the}} women subsequently gives the man fellatio. After finishing the sexual acts, they return to the car.|$|E

5|$|Cristiano Ronaldo is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 406 goals. Five {{other players}} have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–64), Santillana (1971–88), Ferenc Puskás (1958–66), Hugo Sánchez (1985–92) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds {{the record for}} the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), {{alongside}} being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 285 goals. Di Stéfano's 49goals in 58matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, which now is held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals. The fastest goal {{in the history of the}} club (12 seconds) was scored by the Brazilian Ronaldo on 3 December 2003 during a league match against Atlético Madrid.|$|E
5|$|Each {{contestant}} had {{the same}} decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt {{to answer the question}} or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question {{at the end of the}} tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's {{name had}} been {{proposed}} several times for the Democratic nomination for president, but he never captured a majority of delegates. In 1880, however, Hancock's chances improved. President Hayes had promised not to run for a second term, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> Democratic nominee, Tilden, declined to run again due to poor health. Hancock faced several competitors for the nomination, including Thomas A. Hendricks, Allen G. Thurman, Stephen Johnson Field, and Thomas F. Bayard. Hancock's neutrality on the monetary question, and his lingering support in the South (owing to his General Order Number 40) meant that Hancock, {{more than any other}} candidate, had nationwide support. When the Democratic convention assembled in Cincinnati in June 1880, Hancock led on the first ballot, but did not have a majority. By the second ballot, Hancock received the requisite two-thirds, and William Hayden English of Indiana was chosen as his running mate.|$|E

As {{a result of}} the halting of 152mm howitzer production, the Red Army corps artillery lacked a weapon more mobile than the heavy 152 mm howitzer-gun M1937 (ML-20) (typically employed by army-level and Reserve of the Main Command artillery units), but more powerful than the 122 mm howitzer M1938 (M-30).|$|E

It only took until September 1991 for vandals to destroy the keepers' cottages by fire. In 1992 the Australian Construction Services cleared the site and stabilised some of the building elements, and a security fence was installed.|$|E
5|$|In the June 2009 {{legislative}} elections, Kirchner {{was defeated}} by Francisco de Narváez of the Union PRO coalition for National Deputy of Buenos Aires Province. The Front for Victory was defeated in the Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and Córdoba, and the Kirchners lost the Congressional majority. Voter disenchantment with the Kirchners was caused by inflation, crime <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> year's agricultural conflict, which cost them rural support. The Kirchners pushed a media law through during the Congress' lame-duck session. The Kirchners described it as an antitrust law to limit media ownership, but critics considered instead that {{it was used to}} reduce the freedom of the press.|$|E

5|$|The 2009 {{version was}} {{released}} for sale September 9, 2008.

Average installation times range from eight to ten minutes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> 2008 version had a 400 MB footprint. Other goals included reducing load time after the computer starts, from 20–30 seconds to 10 seconds, and file scanning times with a technology allowing Norton to skip certain trusted files.

5|$|The Executive Committee has {{ultimate}} {{authority over}} all policy {{decisions of the}} LSA. The Committee is composed of 12 members, 11 of which have voting privileges.

The remaining seven positions are specifically elected and held {{by members of the}} LSA. One is a student member, elected to a two-year term, while the remaining six are full members elected to three year terms. The elections for the three-year terms are staggered, with two members elected each year. The Executive Director is nominated by the Executive Committee and appointed by the President. They serve as the Chief Administrative Officer, overseeing the Society's application and adherence to policies, and report directly to the Executive Committee.|$|E

5|$|The actual road {{names were}} not known until early 2009, when Transport Minister Simon O'Brien {{revealed}} that the section south of Pinjarra Road would be known as Forrest Highway, with the section to the north {{to become part of}} the Kwinana Freeway. The route bypasses Mandurah by taking traffic around the eastern side of the Peel-Harvey Estuary prior to joining the existing dual carriageway on Old Coast Road, reducing the journey time from Perth to Bunbury. The Kwinana Freeway extension and Forrest Highway were opened on 20 September 2009, with a ceremony held at the interchange between the freeway, highway, and Pinjarra Road. The roads were officially opened by Premier Colin Barnett, Senator Chris Evans, Transport Minister Simon O'Brien, Member for Canning Don Randall, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> Transport Minister Alannah MacTiernan.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} other {{highways}} that bore the M-51 designation. The first connected Holland and Grand Rapids {{with the birth}} of the highway system in 1919. After the creation of the United States Numbered Highway System in 1926, the number was moved to a different highway in The Thumb area. That second highway was scaled back and later decommissioned in the 1960s. The current highway dates back to 1971 when the southern end of M-40 was rerouted, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> alignment was given the M-51 moniker. It was extended to the state line in 1998 to complete the current highway.|$|E
