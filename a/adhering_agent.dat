40|$|A {{label-free}} electrochemical biosensor {{for detecting}} DNA hybridisation {{was developed by}} monitoring {{the change in the}} voltammetric activity of ferrocenecarboxylic acid at the biosensor-solution interface. The biosensor was constructed by initially immobilising on a glassy carbon electrode an anchoring layer consisting of chitosan, carboxyl group functionalised carbon nanofibres and glutaraldehye. Chitosan acted as an <b>adhering</b> <b>agent</b> and carbon nanofibres were strategically used to provide a large surface area with binding points for DNA immobilisation, while glutaraldehye was a linker for DNA probes on the electrode surface. Based on a two-factorial design, cyclic voltammetry of [Fe(CN) 6] 3 -/ 4 - was performed to optimise the composition of the anchoring layer. Next, a 17 -base pair DNA probe was attached to the anchoring layer, followed by its complementary target. Zr(IV) ion, known to exhibit affinity for oxygen-containing electroactive markers, for example, ferrocenecarboxylic acid, was then coordinated in the DNA duplex. In this way, ferrocenecarboxylic acid was attracted towards the biosensor for oxidation. A change in the voltammetric oxidation current of ferrocenecarboxylic acid pre- and post-hybridisation was used to provide an indication of hybridisation. A linear dynamic range between 0. 5 and 40 nM and a detection limit of 88 pM of DNA target were then achieved. In addition, the biosensor exhibited good selectivity, repeatability and stability for the determination of DNA sequences. 10 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Electrospinning is an {{attractive}} method for producing nanofibrous scaffolds for tissue engineering and for controlled drug delivery. The aim of this thesis was to develop functionalized nanofibers as a controlled delivery system for growth factors. Nanofibers were functionalized by simple adhesion of bioactive agents to the nanofiber surface, and incorporating them into the nanofiber mesh using a blend or coaxial electrospinning technique. Within the framework of this thesis, poly--caprolactone (PCL) nanofibers were functionalized with platelets, and also with synthetic growth factors and with growth factors incorporated into liposomes adhered to the nanofiber surface. Functionalized PCL nanofibers with <b>adhered</b> bioactive <b>agents</b> appear to be suitable for drug delivery of growth factors, and for tissue engineering applications with comparatively short time scales. In {{the second set of}} experiments, we focused on prolonging the release time of growth factors by incorporating them into the liposome-nanofiber system using blend or coaxial electrospinning.

We describe how they are produced and detail their role in a comprehensive cognitive architecture designed to explain, integrate, and model human cognition.

30|$|Sizing is {{a widely}} used process to impart water {{resistance}} to paper and paperboard by treating fiber substrate with hydrophobic substance. There {{are two types of}} sizing: surface sizing and internal sizing. Internal sizing chemicals used in papermaking at the wet end are Alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) [14 – 16], alkyl succinic anhydride (ASA) [17] and rosin [18]. Surface sizing agents consist of mainly modified starches and other chemicals, such as waterborne polyurethane [19, 20], styrene/acrylic type polymers [21 – 23]. Surface sizing agents are amphiphilic molecules having both hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) ends. The sizing <b>agent</b> <b>adheres</b> to fibers substrate and forms a film, with the hydrophilic tail facing the fiber and the hydrophobic tail facing outwards, resulting in a smooth finish that tends to be water-repellent, which can prevent water to wetting the paper sheet. What is wetting? Wetting is the ability of liquids to form interfaces with solid surfaces. To determine the degree of wetting, the water contact angle that is formed between the liquid and the solid surface is measured, which is a good indicator of wetting or dewetting. The smaller the water contact angle and the smaller the surface tension, the greater the degree of wetting [24]. The Young’s equation describes wetting if 0 ° ≤ θ <  90 ° and non-wetting if θ >  90 °, which mean a water drop spreading out to increase the contact surface on a hydrophilic surface, but minimizing the contact surface on a hydrophobic surface. By the same token, for paper or paperboard, the greater the water contact angle, the better the water resistance. From the Young’s equation, the high surface tension of solid is more easily wetted than that of low surface tension. Surface sizing agents are amphiphilic molecules, having both hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) ends. The sizing <b>agent</b> <b>adheres</b> to substrate fibers and forms a film, with the hydrophilic tail facing the fiber and the hydrophobic tail facing outwards, resulting in a smooth finish that tends to reduce the surface tension of the sheet, which make the paper sheet water-repellent and which is also the surface sizing mechanism.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel system for selling bundles of news items. Through the system, {{customers}} bargain with the seller over the price {{and quality of the}} delivered goods. The advantage of the developed system is that it allows for a high degree of flexibility in the price, quality, and content of the offered bundles. The price, quality, and content of the delivered goods may, for example, differ based on daily dynamics and personal interest of customers. Autonomous "software agents" execute the negotiation on behalf of the users of the system. To perform the actual negotiation these agents make use of bargaining strategies. We present the novel approach of decomposing bargaining strategies into concession strategies and Pareto-efficient search strategies. Additionally, we introduce the orthogonal and orthogonal-DF strategy: two Pareto search strategies. We show through computer experiments that the use of these Pareto search strategies will result in very efficient bargaining outcomes. Moreover, the system is setup such that it is actually {{in the best interest of}} the customer to have their <b>agent</b> <b>adhere</b> to this approach of disentangling the bargaining strategy...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} trust and {{cooperation}} is {{a major component of}} multi-agent systems research. Such work often focuses on how best to estimate the reliability of a specific agent, or how to create strategies and protocols that engender the most cooperation from the most agents. However, when cooperation is not a desired aspect of a multi-agent system, these actions define collusive behavior, which can {{have a significant impact on}} the dynamics of the system. This thesis defines a generic, graph-theoretic approach to collusion detection known as Collusion Detection using Interaction Graphs (CODING). This approach detects group-based collusion, targeting two basic collusion mechanisms that rely on large numbers of colluding agents for success. CODING analyzes and classifies agent interactions from the system and constructs a series of interaction graphs from this data. These graphs are processed for structures that correspond to collusion mechanisms; the agents composing these structures are reported as colluders. CODING is applied to a game theory domain, in which it must detect <b>agents</b> <b>adhering</b> to group strategies in round-robin tournaments composed of single-player strategies...|$|R

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis seeks primarily {{to establish a}} model which shows how loanwords in Japanese evolve through a stepwise process. The process starts well before the actual borrowing itself, when Japanese school children acquire a stratum of English morphemes to which conventional pronunciations have been ascribed. This stratum {{could be said to}} be composed of a large set of orthography-pronunciation analogies. Foreign words are then extracted from foreign word stocks by agents of introduction, typically advertising copywriters or magazine journalists. However, since these words are unsuitable for use in Japanese as is, the agents then proceed to domesticate them according to Japanese rules of phonology, orthography, morphology, syntax and semantics. The next step involves transference into the public zone, crucially via the written word, before being disseminated and finally integrated. A few researchers have hinted that such a process exists but have taken it no further. Here, proof is evinced by interviews with the agents themselves and together with documentary and quantitative corpus analyses it is shown that lexical borrowing of western words in Japanese proceeds in accordance with such a model. It is furthermore shown that these <b>agents</b> <b>adhere</b> to one of three broad cultural environments and borrow/domesticate words within this genre. They then pass along channels of tran, ference, dissemination and integration in accordance with genre specific patterns. Investigation of these genre-specific channels of evolution constitutes the second research objective. Three other research objectives are addressed within the framework of this model, namely genre-specific patterns of transference and dissemination, when a word changes from being a foreign word to being an integrated loanword, and factors governing the displacement of native words by loanwords...|$|R

An interesting phenomenon in Badau district is the apparently harmonious social relations between the kaolin mining companies and the community, including community leaders, Islamic religious leaders, prominent members and other members. This study investigated the role played by community leaders and community relations practitioners in their efforts to undertake community development activities as part of relationship building strategies. This study examined how community relations practitioners and community leaders create and maintain mutually beneficial relations in a mining community in Badau Village. Through a qualitative approach using case study design, the research employed a combination of ethnography, document analysis and interviews with representatives of two kaolin mining companies, community leaders and residents of Badau village. This study critically contributes to the agency theory by adding a new dimension of the relationship between agent and principal. It was previously contended that <b>agent</b> <b>adheres</b> to only its official principal. However, the study findings demonstrate that an <b>agent</b> may <b>adhere</b> to more than one principal. This flexibility depends on how each principal is able to strategize its usage of sources of power, such as money and knowledge.

Holton claims that these well-known accounts of action cannot explain cases in which an <b>agent</b> <b>adheres</b> {{to the dictates of}} a previous resolution in spite of a persistent desire to the contrary. In this chapter, I present an explanation and defense of Holton’s criticism of these accounts of action, and then I argue that while Holton highlights a crucial deficiency in both, his own explanation of strength of will is problematic. 1. Strength of will as adherence to a resolution How do you succeed in persisting with a resolution {{in the face of a}} compelling desire to the contrary? For example, imagine that you have recently decided to give up espresso and that you now desire to refrain from doing so. Imagine further that unaware of your decision I present you with the opportunity to drink a freshly brewed espresso from your favorite café and you find yourself with a compelling desire to accept my offer, one whose influence is felt more powerfully than your previous desire. In spite of this strong desire, though, you refrain from accepting my offer, thereby adhering to your previous decision and displaying what shall here be called strength of will. According to Richard Holton, two prominent accounts of action cannot explain cases in which you manage to do this sort of thing. 1 He describes the two accounts 2 as follows: The Humean Account: All action is explained in terms of your beliefs and desires, where you act on whichever of your desires are strongest. 3 On this account, when you adhere to the dictates of a resolution, the resolution itself must be understood either as the strongest desire or the strongest combination of beliefs and desires...|$|R
40|$|At {{least since}} Knight (1921), economists have {{suspected}} that the distinction between risk and `uncertainty 2 ̆ 7 might be important in economics. However,Savage (1954) showed this distinction is meaningless if <b>agents</b> <b>adhere</b> to certain axioms, which seem to be normatively compelling. Savage 2 ̆ 7 s SubjectiveExpected Utility (SEU) model became the dominant paradigm in economics, and remains so to this very day. Still, suspicions that the distinction matters never really died. The Ellsberg Paradox (1961) first raised doubts about the SEU model. Then, Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989) showed how to modifySavage 2 ̆ 7 s axioms so that the distinction does matter. In their model, agents entertain a set of priors, and optimize against the worst-caseprior. Finally, Hansen and Sargent (2008) operationalized this new approach by linking it to the engineering literature on `robust control 2 ̆ 7. My dissertationapplies the Hansen-Sargent framework to the foreign exchange market. I show that if we think of market participants as confronting both uncertainty andrisk, then we can easily explain several well known empirical puzzles in the foreign exchange market. The second chapter of my dissertation, entitled "Robustness and Exchange Rate Volatility", {{was published in the}} Journal of International Economics in 2013, and is coauthored with my supervisor, Prof. Kenneth Kasa. This paper uses the monetary model of exchange rates. It assumes investors are aware of their own lack of knowledge about the economy. They respond to their ignorance strategically, by constructing forecasts that are robust to model misspecification. We show that revisions of robust forecasts are more sensitive to new information, and can easily explain observed violations of Shiller 2 ̆ 7 s variance bound inequality. The third chapter, entitled "Model Uncertainty and the Forward Premium Puzzle", was published in the "Journal of International Money and Finance" in 2014. It studies a standard two-country Lucas (1982) asset-pricing model. The main objective is to understand the determinants of observed excess return in the foreign exchange market. The paper shows that Hansen-Jagannathan (1991) volatility bounds can be attained with both reasonable degrees of risk aversion and empirically plausible detection error probabilities. Hence, excess returns in the foreign exchange market appear to be primarily driven by a `model uncertainty premium 2 ̆ 7 rather than a risk premium. The fourth chaper, entitled "Robust Learning in the Foreign Exchange Market", was recently revised and resubmitted to the "Canadian Journal of Economics". Following Hansen and Sargent (2010), it assumes agents cope with uncertainty by both learning and by formulating robust decision rules. Agents entertain two competing models, differing by the persistence of consumption growth. As in my previous paper, agents continue to doubt the specification of each model. It shows that robust learning can not only explain unconditional risk premia in the foreign exchange market, but can also explain the cyclical dynamics of risk premia. In particular, an empirically plausible concern for model misspecification and model uncertainty generates a stochastic discount factor that uniformly satisfies the spectral Hansen-Jagannathan bound of Otrok et. al. (2007) ...|$|R
