40|$|Over 10 {{years the}} {{terrorist}} activities and threats {{have become the}} growing problem in Indonesia. Following the September 9 th, 2004, vehicle bombing of the Australian Embassy in Kuningan, Jakarta, July 17 th, 2009, bombing at the JW Marriott hotel and Ritz-Carlton hotel, Jakarta, until the most recent terrorist activities January 14 th, 2016, explosions and gun fire near Plaza Sarinah, Jl. MH Thamrin, Jakarta Pusat. As we already aware that terrorists were targeting the government buildings, embassies, hotels, but after {{a decade and a}} half of rolling waves of terrorist act across the world, these buildings are now harder to hit, so they’ve changed their target, over the last 13 months there has been a series of extremely bloody attacks on school, colleges and universities. This final project attempts to analyze the UAJY’s library structure subjected to the blast loading especially from vehicle bombing. The blast loading obtains by using software called AT Blast and compared with the procedure proposed by UFC 3 - 340 - 02. The blast load was analytically determined as a pressure-time history and numerical model of the structure was created using ETABS 2015 (v. 15. 2. 0), the conventional software for the static/dynamic analysis of structures, as a full 3 D model with Beam elements for girders and columns and Shell elements for slabs. The blast pressure is depending on the stand-off distance. Peak refracted overpressure Pr was increasing when the stand-off distance decreasing. Resulted in the reflected overpressure is more at the bottom floors and low at the top floors. Blast has a characteristic of high amplitude, the explosion near the structure can cause catastrophic damage to the structure, from the story drift ratio result it was observed that the story drift exceeds the story drift limitation as per SNI 1726 : 2012 Section 7. 12. 1 the story drift ratio shall not exceed 0. 015.

Coal and nonmetal mining used about 43 billion pounds <b>of</b> explosives and <b>blasting</b> agents between 1989 to 1999. A majority of this consumption was used at surface mines. Accident data indicates that fly rock and lack <b>of</b> <b>blast</b> area security {{were the primary}} causes <b>of</b> <b>blasting</b> related injuries in surface mining. Fatal injuries due to lack <b>of</b> <b>blast</b> area security were attributed to: failure to clear blast area; failure to follow instructions; inadequate guarding; inadequate blasting shelter; and unsafe location. Seven fatalities due to fly rock and lack <b>of</b> <b>blast</b> area security were reported in surface coal mines and six in nonmetal mines. Out of these, two fatalities (one each in coal and nonmetal mines) occurred outside the mine property. In the coal mining sector, two fatalities were attributed to fly rock, and five to lack <b>of</b> <b>blast</b> area security. In the nonmetal mining sector, three fatalities were attributed to fly rock, and three to lack <b>of</b> <b>blast</b> area security. Preventive measures include: ensuring that all personnel have evacuated the blast area during shot firing; using adequate blasting shelters for employees whose presence is required in the blast area; controlling and monitoring all entrances to the blast area; ensuring that the blast is properly designed, drilled, and loaded; and emphasizing education and training to enhance skill levels for implementation of engineering control techniques...|$|R
