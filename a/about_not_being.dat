5|$|Culverhouse's {{relationships}} with other NFL owners were occasionally, as in {{his relationship with the}} Rams, alleged to constitute conflicts of interest. His $3 million loan to help Philadelphia Eagles owner Leonard Tose with his gambling debts was one example, as it violated the NFL constitution and bylaws. On other occasions, he was criticized for his overly-secretive ways as NFL Finance Committee Chairman, as other league owners found it difficult to obtain information on how league finances were being spent. In particular, owners were upset <b>about</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> informed about money given to NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle in a 5-year extension of his contract. The extension was awarded to him by the Finance Committee as a reward for negotiation of the league television contract in 1982, even though Rozelle had five years remaining on his current contract.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{ordered the}} {{motorcade}} {{to turn around}} at the Bridge Street intersection because he realised that they had proceeded further than expected, and because the police officers {{were not going to}} stop them. After partially turning the motorcade, Licciardello alighted onto the street and complained, in character as bin Laden, <b>about</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> invited to the APEC Summit. At this point, the police requested Morrow's identity. After inspecting his fake pass, officers realised that Morrow was from The Chaser and took all eleven members of the motorcade into custody. Surprisingly, as pointed out by the team on their television show, the officers initially ignored Licciardello (Osama Bin Laden) and only arrested Morrow.|$|E
5|$|Paulo {{was written}} to be unlikable, {{with the hope}} he would redeem himself when his backstory was {{revealed}} in his final episode. Paulo either resents or is indifferent toward the often heroic actions {{of some of the}} survivors, spending much of his time golfing. He complains to Nikki <b>about</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> included; however, he does little to help out around the camp and does not try to improve his status in the survivors' hierarchy. When he does get chances to participate in treks, for example, when Hurley finds a car, Paulo is uninterested and discourages Nikki from joining Hurley on his adventure. Nikki tries to participate, tending to a wounded Mr. Eko and volunteering to go with Locke to the Pearl station, much to the surprise of Paulo. Paulo accompanies her, and he exhibits a constant sarcastic behavior in the Pearl.|$|E

A maid tries to no avail to wake him up in his motel room. Meanwhile, Dean Winchester (Ackles) finds his brother Sam (Padalecki) drinking at a bar {{in the middle of}} the afternoon. When Dean questions him about it, a drunken Sam admits that he is upset <b>about</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> able to save Dean from his demonic pact, which left him only a year to live. What bothers Sam even more is that Dean, who has little self-worth, is not even concerned about his fate. Their conversation is interrupted by a call from the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peattie's {{landlord}} sneaks {{into his}} apartment for pain medication and finds Lynette's body in his bed. Immediately, she contracts a flesh-eating disease. After {{hearing about the}} incident on the news, Mulder goes to Peattie's apartment and finds the body, now headless. Peattie finds the Wieder family, whom Scully is protecting, and makes a poppet with Scully's hair and photo inside. He places nails in the doll's eyes and Scully promptly goes blind. Peattie breaks into the house, takes Scully's gun and stabs a poppet of Wieder, causing the doctor to collapse in pain. Wieder gets Peattie to admit that he's taking out his own guilt <b>about</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> able to save Lynette by blaming him instead. Mulder shows up, finds Scully's doll and removes the nails from it, allowing her to regain her vision and shoot Peattie. He is placed in a coma and Lynnette's body is shipped back to her home in West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Two Air Corps historians {{state that}} no {{evidence}} exists that the Navy {{was behind the}} order. One explained that Craig believed the Air Corps violated War Department policy on publicity, while the second asserted that Craig was unhappy <b>about</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> provided details of the mission before it was publicly announced, and thus issued the order to ensure full notification before granting exceptions to the restriction. Deputy chief of staff Embick made {{the claim that the}} restriction had been issued only as a safety measure. Greer, however, in his history of Air Corps doctrine, firmly attributes the restriction to the Navy, noting that in November 1938 it achieved a new modification of the Joint Action statement specifically granting it the authorization for long-range land-based flights that the Army was denied, and immediately prepared six major bases to conduct them. A fourth historian, in a biography of Arnold, stated that the restriction had actually been promulgated on 1 September 1936, at the insistence of the Navy, but was not enforced by Craig until after the Rex incident.|$|E

This radioactive, lethal gas invaded a 60 m2 (646 ft2) room but was contained. According to news reports, the gas leak did not affect any of the 450 workers or the 8,000 residents of the nearest district. However, the communities in the area nearby complained <b>about</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> informed about the accident.|$|E
25|$|The second LP, Find Us A Way {{showed the}} band {{moving away from}} their R roots and taking in new {{influences}} from acts like The Spencer Davis Group, who were themselves starting {{to move away from}} their earlier style.

Although they were apparently unhappy <b>about</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> not consulted over the final track selection or the cover art, it also sold very well.|$|E
25|$|Tanaka {{initially}} planned out 50 songs, {{but this}} was far too many to record and fit into the game within allotted time and budget estimates, so the number was cut down to 24. The number was further cut down toe seven, but Hiroi was brought close to tears by this. Faced with this issue, Tanaka asked how much music the team could manage, {{and was told that}} one CD's worth of content was enough. Tanaka eventually settled on between eleven and twelve songs which made it into the final game. The lyrics of all the songs were written by Hiroi, despite his repeated protests <b>about</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> a professional lyricist. Due to Hiroi's self-professed inexperience, Tanaka ended up being a teacher figure for him. As part of his training, Hiroi went to karaoke sessions, studied the work of famous songwriter Yū Aku, and bought old records of vintage songs. The learning process took between one and two months before Hiroi was competent at writing song lyrics. The songs of Sakura Wars all started with Hiroi creating the lyrics and then handing his work to Tanaka for polishing and to be set to music.|$|E
