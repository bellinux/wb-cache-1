25|$|Refineries {{examine whether}} {{it makes sense}} {{economically}} to install alkylation units. Alkylation units are complex, with substantial economy of scale. SAAU and HFAU have comparable capital investment costs. It {{is not surprising that}} the two processes are competitive on a capital cost basis, when one considers the basic process differences. The SAAU has a more expensive reactor section and requires refrigeration. However, equal costs are realized in the HF unit by the need for feed driers, product treating, regeneration equipment and more exotic metallurgy. In addition, most refiners will require a dedicated cooling system for an HF unit, to remove the risk of site-wide corrosion in the case of an HF leak. It should be noted that these capital cost estimates do not account for the additional safety and mitigation equipment now required in HF units. Due to the possible hazardous <b>aerosol</b> <b>formation</b> when the HF catalyst is released as a superheated liquid, expensive mitigation systems are now required in many locations throughout the world where HF is used as an alkylation catalyst.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{demonstrates}} a systems framework for assessment of environmental impacts from ‘green initiatives’, through {{a case study}} of meso-scale, anthropogenic–biogenic interactions. The following cross-sectoral green initiatives, combining the emerging trends in the North East region of the United Kingdom, have been considered – increasing the vegetation cover; decarbonising road transport; decentralising energy production through biomass plants. Two future scenarios are assessed – Baseline_ 2020 (projected emissions from realisation of policy instruments); Aggressive_ 2020 (additional emissions from realisation of green initiatives). Resulting trends from the Aggressive_ 2020 scenario suggest an increase in emissions of pollutant precursors, including biogenic volatile organic compounds and nitrogen dioxide over the base case by up to 20 % and 5 % respectively. This has implications for enhanced daytime ozone and secondary <b>aerosols</b> <b>formation</b> by up to 15 % and over 5 % respectively.
