Smith was again resolute: why, he queried, was Whitehall so adamant to avoid legal arbitration if its ministers were so sure they were right? He promised to drop the matter if such a panel ruled against him, but to no avail. Johnston said only that he would telegraph Whitehall to inform them that Reedman's appointment was imminent. Dupont confirmed it that afternoon, telling the Rhodesian Legislative Assembly that the mission had been accepted by Portugal.|$|E

25|$|Within {{days of his}} {{confession}} in open court, Heirens denied any responsibility for the murders. Mary Jane Blanchard, daughter of murder victim Josephine Ross, {{was one of the}} first dissenters, being quoted in 1946 as saying:I cannot believe that young Heirens murdered my mother.

25|$|An inquest {{into the}} deaths of the six men was opened in March 2006 in Oxfordshire. The inquest heard {{evidence}} that they men were only issued with 50 rounds each for their SA-80 rifles and that no satellite phone was allocated to them, although 37 units were available <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> to prevent the Red Caps from signing one out. The inquest heard detailed reports into the men's injuries {{at the hands of the}} mob with multiple gunshot wounds to hands, legs arms and faces. Relatives at the inquest demanded an apology from Dr Nicholas Hunt, the government appointed pathologist, as he had used photographs of the dead men in a seminar in how to set up temporary mortuaries in disaster zones without permission from the families.|$|E
25|$|The council {{maintained}} {{control by}} forbidding its affiliates from competing in matches against unaffiliated bodies without permission, {{and with the}} threat of excluding from the council any leagues, players or clubs who defied its rules. This meant that leagues could face exclusion if they played representative matches against un-affiliated leagues or their clubs without permission. It also meant that players who broke the ANFC's transfer rules by switching to an un-affiliated league without a clearance would be banned from affiliated leagues. Any penalties imposed by the council were inherently valid only within the council-affiliated competitions, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> to stop a league or player from ignoring council rules and carrying on in an unaffiliated system – and the Victorian Football Association spent much of its history operating in this manner – however, by virtue of the council's size, the number of options for unaffiliated leagues and players was sufficiently small to encourage most competitions to adhere to council rules and remain affiliated.|$|E

25|$|Franklin's party reached Fort Enterprise on 12 October 1821, {{two days}} after Back. They found it deserted and unstocked. The promised {{supplies}} of dried meat had not appeared, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> to eat except bones from the previous winter, a few rotting skins which had been used as bedding, and a little tripe de roche. A note from Back explained {{that he had found}} the fort in this state, and that he was heading towards Fort Providence to look for Akaitcho and his first nation members. The party despaired. Two voyageurs, Augustus and Benoit, set off upriver in the hope of meeting some first nation people. The rest of the group remained, too weak to go any further. Two of the voyageurs lay down crying and waited to die, and even the normally optimistic Franklin wrote of how quickly his strength was evaporating. None of them had eaten meat for four weeks.|$|E
500|$|A {{major problem}} for the team from the start was that wreck sites in the UK lacked any legal {{protection}} from plunderers and treasure hunters. Sunken ships, once being moving objects, were legally treated as chattel and were awarded to those who could first raise them. The Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 also stipulated that any objects raised from a wreck should be auctioned off to finance the salvage operations, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> preventing anyone from [...] "stealing" [...] the wreck and making a profit. The problem was handled by forming an organisation, the Mary Rose Committee, aiming [...] "to find, excavate, raise and preserve for all time such remains of the ship Mary Rose as may be of historical or archaeological interest".|$|E
500|$|According to a December 2011 {{interview}} with Craig, [...] "We had the bare bones of a script {{and then there}} was a writers' strike <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> we could do. We couldn't employ a writer to finish it. I say to myself, 'Never again', but who knows? There was me trying to rewrite scenes—and a writer I am not." [...] He said that he and Forster [...] "were the ones allowed to do it. The rules were that you couldn't employ anyone as a writer, but the actor and director could work on scenes together. We were stuffed. We got away with it, but only just. It was never meant to be as much of a sequel as it was, but it ended up being a sequel, starting where the last one finished." ...|$|E

500|$|She {{attended}} Southport State Primary School {{and experienced}} the personal struggles of a lonely childhood as {{she wanted a}} life similar to her school friends. [...] "Their mums and dads were married. They had brothers and sisters. They had afternoon tea. They had a cooked dinner. I never had that. I'd get home from school <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> in the cupboard. I would eat mouldy bread and drink water because that would fill me up". Coulter grew up mostly on her own because her mother worked two jobs to pay the bills. During primary school, Coulter participated in many sports, including swimming, touch football and netball, which she played for six years. When Coulter was nine years old, her mother met John, a man of Scottish descent who is now her step father. Coulter has two half-sisters, Jodie and Emily.|$|E
500|$|The Samoan {{team was}} not feeling downhearted after the game, and even embraced and sang to the {{audience}} as the game finished. Salapu declared that he enjoyed the game. [...] "I wasn't embarrassed because we all learned something from it. If we had all our players maybe {{it would have been}} only five or six goals, because I was without my best defenders <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> I could do." [...] Tony Langkilde also defended the goalkeeper, saying that he [...] "kept the score down with a magnificent display". He also added that [...] "now we are recognised by FIFA, it has really helped spark an interest in football on the islands". Samoan manager Tunoa Lui commented that football was being played in the Samoan elementary and high schools and [...] "in five years we will be competitive." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{positively}} {{reviewed by the}} contemporary trade publications that garnered almost universal acclaim. The Moving Picture News stated {{that this was the}} first Shakespeare adaptation by an Independent producer and said, [...] "We were asked to inspect and criticize this film, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> for us to do but give our full approval and applause, which we do right heartily." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror praised the production and commented on the clear adaptation of Shakespeare's work, resulting in an unusually clear presentation of the story. Another review in The Moving Picture World praised the film in a follow-up to the first review, commenting on the ephemeral nature of the productions by saying [...] "Few, indeed, will be the releases of the month to surpass this, and few, indeed, are the pictures that seem so complete and in every way satisfactory." ...|$|E

500|$|Engel {{obtained}} {{stories from}} moderately well-known science fiction names for both issues, including John Jakes, Mack Reynolds, Jack Vance, and Raymond F. Jones, {{but many of}} the stories were [...] "barrel-scrapings" [...] from the Scott Meredith Literary Agency, {{in the words of one}} historian; most had already been rejected at the other active science fiction markets. Space SF also published Arthur C. Clarke's [...] "Critical Mass", one of the popular [...] "White Hart" [...] stories. It had already appeared in a 1949 edition of a British magazine, Lilliput, but Clarke revised it for this publication. Overall, in the words of Mike Ashley, [...] "... carried stories by noted sf writers, [...] they read like rejects from better magazines, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> of lasting value". Ashley comments that the best story was Jakes's [...] "The Devil Spins a Sun-Dream", which was atmospheric if poorly plotted; the protagonist, a human prospector on Mars, finds a fabulous city, but an ancient booby-trap destroys it before his eyes.|$|E
500|$|Further {{disappointment}} followed as the American 4 x 100m relay team, with Gay as anchor, {{failed to}} qualify for the final. Darvis Patton and Gay failed to pass on the baton in the heat. Gay personally took responsibility for the dropped baton but Patton denied this was true, saying [...] "That's Tyson Gay. He's a humble guy, but I know it's my job to get the guy the baton and I didn't do that." [...] After stating his desire to win four Olympic gold medals (by adding the 400 metres to his repertoire) earlier in the year, Gay finished the 2008 Olympics without a single medal. Having failed to reach the finals of the 100m sprint or relay, he reflected upon his failure to make the podium in Beijing: [...] " [...] then I went to grab it <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing.</b> It's kind of the way it's been happening to me this Olympics." ...|$|E
500|$|Neal Purvis and Robert Wade {{returned}} as screenwriters and completed {{a draft of}} the script by April 2007; Paul Haggis also worked on the script, completing it two hours before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike officially began. Further work on the script had to be undertaken by Forster and Daniel Craig, who said later, [...] "We had the bare bones of a script {{and then there was a}} writers' strike <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> we could do. We couldn't employ a writer to finish it. I say to myself, 'Never again', but who knows? There was me trying to rewrite scenes – and a writer I am not". Craig also admitted that the film was not initially meant to be a sequel, but it became one because of the re-writes undertaken by him and Forster. Haggis located his draft's climax in the Swiss Alps, but Forster wanted the action sequences to allude to the four classical elements of earth, water, air and fire. Michael G. Wilson decided on the film's title Quantum of Solace only [...] "a few days" [...] before its announcement on 24 January 2008. Forster hired Dennis Gassner as production designer, replacing Peter Lamont.|$|E

500|$|Monteux {{wished to}} {{continue}} his work in helping young conductors: [...] "Conducting is not enough. I must create something. I am not a composer, so I will create fine young musicians." [...] In addition to his classes in Paris and Les Baux in the 1930s he had given private lessons to Igor Markevitch; later private students included André Previn, Seiji Ozawa, José Serebrier and Robert Shaw. Previn called him [...] "the kindest, wisest man I can remember, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> about conducting he didn't know." [...] After a performance conducted by Previn, Monteux said to him, [...] "Did you think the orchestra was playing well? ... So did I. Next time don't interfere with them." [...] Previn said that he never forgot this advice. Monteux's best-known undertaking as a teacher was the Pierre Monteux School for conductors and orchestral musicians, held each summer {{at his home in}} Hancock, Maine from 1943 onwards. Internationally known alumni of the school include Leon Fleisher, Erich Kunzel, Lorin Maazel, Neville Marriner, Hugh Wolff and David Zinman. Other Monteux students included John Canarina, whose 2003 biography was the first full-length study of the conductor in English, Charles Bruck, one of Monteux's first pupils in Paris, who became music director of the school in Hancock after Monteux's death, and Emanuel Leplin.|$|E
500|$|TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 4 out of 5 stars, writing [...] "Simpsons Season 26 starts {{off with a}} bang, with plenty of laughs {{and even a few}} sentimental moments". Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 4 stars out of 5, commenting 'Clown in the Dumps' may not be {{considered}} a classic episode now, but after a few years when we watch it again on syndication, probably next year on FXX, it will grow in stature. It is a heartfelt episode that does bring on the laughs. The sadness of the episode to me was Jackie Mason's voice, which sounds very tired. Paste gave the episode a rating of 7.1, concluding These days, The Simpsons can be hit or miss, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> to guarantee success from 'Clown in the Dumps'. However, even if the character death was perfunctory, and Rabbi Krustofski has made only a handful of appearances in over 550 episodes, it was still a funny, solid half hour of television. Nothing special—really, it was just another Krusty episode, and not the best Krusty episode. Nevertheless, the 26th season of The Simpsons has started out on somewhat of a high note. The good times keep on rolling for Matt Groening's deathless creation.|$|E
500|$|Despite these problems, {{from late}} October 1974 his {{demeanour}} appeared {{to change for}} the better. His best man, John Wilbraham, remarked that Lucan's apparent obsession over regaining his children had diminished. While having dinner with his mother he cast aside talk of his family problems and turned instead to politics. On 6November he met his uncle John Bevan, apparently in good spirits. Later that day he met 21-year-old Charlotte Andrina Colquhoun, who said that [...] "he seemed very happy, just his usual self, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to suggest that he}} was worried or depressed". He also dined at the Clermont with racing driver Graham Hill. At the time, casinos could open only between 2:00pm and 4:00am, so Lucan often gambled into {{the early hours of the}} morning. He took tablets to deal with his insomnia and therefore usually awoke around lunchtime. On 7November though, he broke routine and called his solicitor early that morning, and at 10:30am took a call from Colquhoun. They arranged to eat at the Clermont at about 3:00pm, but Lucan failed to appear. Colquhoun drove past the Clermont and Ladbroke clubs, and past Elizabeth Street, but could not find his car anywhere. Lucan also failed to arrive for his 1:00pm lunch appointment with artist Dominic Elwes and banker Daniel Meinertzhagen, again at the Clermont.|$|E
