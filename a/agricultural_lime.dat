40|$|The {{agricultural}} soils on South Africa’s Eastern Highveld are acidified {{to some extent}} due to the relatively high rainfall, management practices {{and to a lesser}} extent acid rain. These soils are very sensitive to acidification due to sandstone dominated parent materials, leading to sandy soils with low buffer capacities. Several thousand tons of slags are used annually as liming materials in this area due to the close proximity of two slag producing steel plants. No clear guidelines presently exist in South Africa concerning the use of heavy metal-containing slags as <b>agricultural</b> <b>limes.</b> Three slag products from these two sources were tested for their Cr, V, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn and Mo levels. A soil that had received approximately 20 tons of one of the slags over the past 10 years was subjected to acidification in pots with HNO 3 and H 2 SO 4 separately. EPA 3050, EDTA and NH 4 NO 3 extractions were done on the treated soil and wheat grown in the pots was dry-ashed and Cr, V, and Ni levels determined. In all the cases except the EPA 3050 the metal levels were very low, indicating almost no risk of food-chain pollution with the use of this slag. Long-term projections of current application rates indicate a very slight risk of heavy metal build-up over 100 years for all three slags. There is however a pronounced need for proper guidelines and research to be conducted on the long-term impact of slag use – especially for conditions that differ from those mentioned here...|$|R

25|$|The early 1790s were a {{time when}} there was an {{increasing}} demand for coal, but a shortage in many places because much of the coal being produced was being consumed by industries close to the mines. There were coal reserves near Barnsley, but no transport links to distribute it to the region. In July 1792, the Aire and Calder Canal Company asked William Martin, who was the manager of the canal, to prepare plans for a link from near Wakefield to the Barnsley mines. Hearing of the plans, the River Don Navigation Company proposed an alternative, which involved the canalisation of the River Dearne, to reach the same destination.

40|$|Scholarly {{attention}} has recently {{focused on the}} extent of the deterioration of the Great Barrier Reef and several authors have attempted to place that decline into historical context. We present documentary and oral history evidence that the extent and severity of mining in the Great Barrier Reef has been hitherto neglected in environmental histories of the ecosystem. Extraction of phosphatic sandstone, guano, rock phosphate and coral from many islands, cays and coral reefs have resulted in extensive transformations of some habitats. In particular, Raine, Lady Elliot, Lady Musgrave, North West and Holbourne Islands experienced intensive mining for guano and rock phosphate, while more sustained guano mining took place at Upolu, Oyster and Michaelmas Cays prior to 1940. Coral mining - which has not previously been documented for the Great Barrier Reef - also occurred in at least twelve locations between 1900 and 1940 with the result that thousands of tons of coral were removed from some reefs and pulverised to produce <b>agricultural</b> and industrial <b>lime.</b> This account suggests that historical mining in the Great Barrier Reef has left impacts in the landscape of several islands and cays. Further scientific research and monitoring is required to elucidate the impacts of coral mining, although comparisons with coral mining sites elsewhere in the world suggest that it is reasonable to presume that the impacts of that activity were severe for parts of several reefs, including Snapper Island, Kings and Alexandra Reefs...|$|R

40|$|Fixed wing {{agricultural}} aircraft apply approximately 40 % of the fertiliser used in New Zealand, {{the majority of}} which is applied in hill country. The amount varies from approximately 600, 000 tonnes to 1. 2 million tonnes per annum. About 100 fixed wing aircraft of various types are engaged in agricultural operations {{throughout the country and}} the safety record has been of considerable concern; the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of New Zealand report that there are 12 serious accidents per 100, 000 flying hours which result in 4 deaths, almost 2 annually. Agricultural aviation stakeholders, including, the Department of Labour, Civil Aviation Authority, New Zealand Agricultural Aviation Association (NZAAA) and Federated Farmers are trying {{to reduce the number of}} incidents in the sector by establishing guidelines for airstrips, fertiliser storage facilities, their use and application from them. A large proportion of incidents have, as contributing factors, poor flowing product which cannot be jettisoned in time to avert an accident, collisions with obstructions near the airstrip (20 % of all accidents are aircraft hitting fences in proximity to the airstrip) and damage to aircraft due to an inappropriate surface, such as rutting. The New Zealand topdressing industry handles many products of which only a few are homogenous e. g. Urea and fresh Di-ammonium phosphate. The majority of spreading being undertaken involves products with large variations in particle size and moisture content producing particles from fine dust to concretions. These characteristics make it very difficult to achieve continuous flow and even spreading from an aircraft. There have been a disproportionate number of accidents and near misses in the New Zealand topdressing industry that have occurred whilst spreading <b>agricultural</b> limestone (<b>lime).</b> Lime has been identified as being particularly problematic and is being used as a focus for this study. Superphosphate, which is used as a flow standard in New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority rules, is used as a comparison in powder flow engineering experiments. This thesis is a prescribed project concerned with solving specific problems for industry mainly funded by the Fertiliser Manufacturers’ Research Association. Specific objectives/aims of the project: 1. Quantify the flow characteristic of products being spread and identify risks within the system, identifying risk materials and risk situations. 2. Develop a better understanding of material variability in terms of characterising the different deposits used around New Zealand and relating these differences to flow properties. 3. Develop a better understanding of the mechanisms creating the variability in flow properties that relate to production processes, transport and storage and finally loading and spreading with topdressing aircraft of the different limes used in New Zealand. 4. Quantify system performance in terms of economic and environmental impacts. 5. Identify suitable test methodologies that can be used within the industry to determine whether a product is fit for spreading and its flow characteristics. These would be dispatch tests at the lime quarry or fertiliser plant and a flowabiltiy test as the material is loaded onto the aircraft. 6. Identify design criteria that determine the performance of aircraft in relation to safety, flow control and spreading performance. Work with the interested parties to improve work quality and safety associated with agricultural aviation systems. Flow properties have been quantified using a shear testing regime and engineering design parameters established for mass flow have been calculated from interpreting the powder flow functions. However, as the material from each quarry has variations in particle size distributions caused by factors such as the moisture of the parent limestone, age of the crushing hammers and time being crushed; the results are only an instantaneous solution. All commonly used products except lime are free flowing and shear testing was undertaken on superphosphate samples as a comparison. All the limes tend to be on the cohesive – easy flow boundary. Limes from throughout New Zealand have been classified by mineralogy, have been analysed by thermal decomposition and have had impurities identified through X-ray diffraction. Although there were differences in the particle size distributions and loose and tapped bulk densities between the limes, helium pycnometry testing showed the limes to have similar particle densities. In order to achieve free flow conditions with these products they require modification. The simplest modification that proved effective was the removal of fine particles. This had the effect of reducing the particle size distribution which is important in reducing the packing density and cohesive strength. This was also achieved by only having particles within a narrow particle size range, by removing the fine particles the cohesive strength was reduced and the materials were free flowing. Although this can be done there is clearly a cost involved, the industry is already struggling with reduced demand and any increase in cost is likely to be unwelcome even though it could help to save pilots’ lives and improve the quality of spread achieved. This thesis considers three aspects of topdressing costs in order to estimate the actual costs of spreading fertiliser and lime. The questions posed are; what are the actual costs of operating the two main models of aircraft flown in New Zealand? What size of aircraft fleet is required to fulfil the spreading requirements? What are the on-farm infrastructure costs that also need to be considered in order to calculate the true costs of servicing the application of fertiliser to our hill country sector? Topdressing services mainly the sheep and beef sectors which contribute 22. 5 % of New Zealand’s agricultural output. Farm income in this sector is nearly $ 4 billion. Application of fertiliser is important to sector productivity and the possible collapse of the topdressing industry would have far reaching consequences for these farming sectors and New Zealand’s export earnings. The model finds that there is no financial return on capital invested in the industry. Therefore, the best returns are found by applying fertiliser from old aircraft with aged support vehicles all with little capital value. This is clearly unsustainable as even old aircraft require large injections of capital periodically to maintain airworthiness. As fertiliser prices have increased, application rates have fallen, which increases application cost per tonne applied. The agreed fixed price charging model is traditionally based on an application charge per tonne. It is likely that farmers perceive increased application charges per tonne as a price increase, whereas it is only compensating the applicator for the additional time of sowing at a lower rate. It is clear that although farmers buy fertiliser on a cost per tonne basis this is not the activity based cost driver for the aerial applicator. Converting the cost per hour aircraft cost driver, to a cost per tonne for charging farmers; is confusing as application charges alter by rate and product. The industry needs to alter its charging mechanism to a cost per aircraft flying hour activity based charging regime...|$|R
2500|$|This area of {{the country}} was formed during the Tertiary period, {{containing}} some of the youngest rock in the British Isles. Like the vast majority of Suffolk, the surface 'rock' is the very fertile boulder clay or clay loam, lying on top of layers of chalk. The landscape surrounding the Stour Valley {{is the result of the}} joint effects of past glaciation and the agricultural alteration of the land. [...] Originally the area was under the sea; the shells of the sea creatures dropped to bed of the ocean and formed into chalk about 140 million years ago. Another mineral, silica, filled the sponges and other similar animals in the sea. As this was left behind it formed nodules of hard flint. A ridge of Cretaceous chalk left by the ancient sea juts into Suffolk from Cambridgeshire. This ridge is never more than 140 metres above sea level but it makes what is called High Suffolk. This chalk layer forms the so-called solid rock layer. This chalk was originally quarried where it came to the surface, and was either burned to produce <b>agricultural</b> <b>lime</b> or was mixed with sand, quarried locally, for mortar used in building (hence the presence of cream bricks ('Suffolk whites') for houses in the area). Chalk in the water makes it 'hard' (classified as 'very hard; 511mg/l as calcium carbonate) according to Anglian Water's water quality.|$|E
