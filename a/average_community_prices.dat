40|$|Food {{price policy}} {{relies heavily on}} {{estimated}} price elasticities of food demand to help balance the nutritional and economic objectives in poor countries. Economists use either unit values (ratios of household expenditure to quantity purchased) or <b>community</b> <b>prices</b> (enumerated from vendors in local markets) as proxies for market prices when estimating price elasticities with household survey data. Biases are believed to result from using unit values, due to measurement error and quality effects, but evidence on this issue is lacking and even less is known about <b>community</b> <b>prices.</b> This article provides an empirical evidence from Vietnam, which suggests that economists should exercise caution when estimating price elasticities from household surveys. A 14 -food demand system is estimated alternatively with unit values or <b>community</b> <b>prices,</b> and the elasticity of calories with respect to rice prices is calculated. This elasticity {{is more than twice}} as large (- 0. 54 versus - 0. 22) when <b>community</b> <b>prices</b> are used rather than unit values. Hence, conclusions about the nutritional effects of rice price increases appear sensitive to data choices made by economists. More generally, this discrepancy suggests that the household survey databases commonly used by economists may not provide reliable estimates. ...|$|R

The mixing parameter is set to the ratio between intra- and inter-cluster edges of the found communities. As many networks in our set of real-world networks contain a few small connected components, the smallest communities usually only contain just two nodes while all other communities are much larger. Therefore, frequently our minimum power law exponent 1 is chosen and the expected <b>average</b> <b>community</b> size is still too low. In these cases we also fit the minimum community size using binary search until the expected <b>average</b> <b>community</b> size is the real <b>average</b> <b>community</b> size. Further, if the maximum community size is {{too small for the}} largest internal degree, we increase also the maximum community size to be 5 % larger than the maximum internal degree. Even with these extra 5 % we need several attempts for some of the graphs until random numbers are drawn that actually lead to fitting community sizes and node degrees. In Table  1 this is denoted by plfit*. For the scaling, we simply append copies of the same values.|$|R

This is a phenomenon, where users do not change their behavior (energy consumption in this case) due to the low impact that this change would have on their bill. In contrast, a personalized pricing mechanism is able to treat different users in different ways, according to their flexibility, and thus achieve a specific behavioral change efficiently.|$|R

40|$|Reduction in {{body size}} has been {{proposed}} as a universal response of organisms, both to warming and to decreased salinity. However, it is still controversial if size reduction is caused by temperature or salinity on their own, or if other factors interfere as well. We used natural benthic diatom communities to explore how "body size" (cells and colonies) and motility change along temperature (2 - 26 °C) and salinity (0. 5 - 7. 8) gradients in the brackish Baltic Sea. Fourth-corner analysis confirmed that small cell and colony sizes were associated with high temperature in summer. <b>Average</b> <b>community</b> cell volume decreased linearly with 2. 2 % per °C. However, cells were larger with artificial warming when nutrient concentrations were high in the cold season. <b>Average</b> <b>community</b> cell volume increased by 5. 2 % per °C of artificial warming from 0 to 8. 5 °C and simultaneously there was a selection for motility, which probably helped to optimize growth rates by trade-offs between nutrient supply and irradiation. Along the Baltic Sea salinity gradient cell size decreased with decreasing salinity, apparently mediated by nutrient stoichiometry. Altogether, our results suggest that climate change in this century may polarize seasonality by creating two new niches, with elevated temperature at high nutrient concentrations in the cold season (increasing cell size) and elevated temperature at low nutrient concentrations in the warm season (decreasing cell size). Higher temperature in summer and lower salinity by increased land-runoff are expected to decrease the average cell size of primary producers, {{which is likely to}} affect the transfer of energy to higher trophic levels...|$|R

40|$|In {{the view}} of many analysts, the best way to assist “underwater ” homeowners—those who owe more on their {{mortgages}} than their houses are worth—is to reduce the principal on their home loans. Yet in the case of privately securitized mortgages, such write-downs are almost impossible to carry out, since loan modifications on the scale necessitated by the housing market crash would require collective action by a multitude of geographically dispersed security holders. The solution, this study suggests, is for state and municipal governments to use their eminent domain powers to buy up and restructure underwater mortgages, thereby sidestepping the need to coordinate action across large numbers of security holders.

40|$|The Andean <b>Community's</b> <b>Price</b> Band System (APBS), {{introduced}} in 1995, had the announced goal of reducing domestic price instability by buffering fluctuations in international prices {{through use of}} a variable import tariff. This paper evaluates {{the effects of the}} Andean Price Band System on domestic producer price variability, levels of nominal protection and changes in producer welfare. Application is made to four important food products - maize, rice, sugar and milk - in Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, from the period 1990 to 1998. The effects of the APBS on producer price variability are analyzed through 1) comparing coefficients of variation of detrended, monthly deseasonalized real prices before and after the harmonization of the APBS in 1995, and 2) variance decomposition of real domestic prices. For Colombia and Ecuador, the APBS is shown to have successfully reduced real price instability below levels of instability which existed prior to its introduction. Real exchange rate instability also decreased sharply in these two countries following introduction of the APBS. In Venezuela, real price instability is shown to have increased following introduction of the APBS, while real exchange rate instability was unchanged. The APBS' effects on producer price protection are examined through estimation of average nominal protection coefficients for the twelve country-commodity combinations identified above before and after the introduction of the APBS. Results show that in all three countries and four virtually all products, the APBS contributed to increased producer protection. Finally, this paper uses a variant of the Newbery-Stiglitz approach to calculate efficiency benefits due to risk reduction among producers and the transfer benefits created by redistributing income among producers, consumers and government. The results show that the risk reduction benefits created by the APBS are small. Similarly, the income transfer effects, though larger, are also low, and both contribute to generally low levels of estimated producer welfare effects. Overall, the paper concludes that the APBS has been of limited usefulness as a policy instrument designed to reduce producer price variability in an economically efficient manner.
