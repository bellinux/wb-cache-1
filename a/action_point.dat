25|$|Valkyria Chronicles is a {{tactical}} role-playing {{game in which}} the player uses a unique turn-based battle system called BLiTZ (Battle of Live Tactical Zones). During their turn the player views an overhead map in Command Mode, but zooms in to control each individual unit on the battlefield in Action Mode. Much like the Growlanser series, movement and other actions are handled in real time during Action Mode, though limited in movement by an <b>action</b> <b>point</b> (AP) gauge that varies {{for each type of}} character. During Target Mode, the player is in direct control of characters' aim while the action freezes, allowing for head shots and other maneuvers. Taking command of individual units during the player's phase costs Command Points, which can be used dynamically to grant movement to many different units or the same unit consecutively with diminishing AP reserve, depending on what the player wants to accomplish. By using their troops the player must fulfill various conditions depending on the mission in order to achieve victory, most often the capture of a major enemy encampment. Upon completing missions, the player is awarded money and experience with which to upgrade their materiel and character classes, respectively, and the game's story is advanced. Missions can be failed if the player's forces are wholly incapacitated or killed, the squad's main battle tank is destroyed, or the player's main base camp is captured by the enemy.|$|E
500|$|The Americans {{travelled}} to Florida to {{face the}} Jacksonville Sharks, 27,140 Jacksonville fans, and the Sharks' new coach, Charlie Tate. [...] Birmingham managed a 15–14 win with a touchdown by Charlie Harraway and <b>action</b> <b>point</b> by quarterback Matthew Reed with 19 seconds remaining in the August 21 game. [...] The Americans then went north {{to face the}} Chicago Fire on Thursday, August 29, 1974, in their first nationally televised game. Birmingham won that match-up 22–8 with 44,732 fans in attendance at Soldier Field.|$|E
500|$|The game's battle system, the BliTZ system, {{is carried}} over {{directly}} from Valkyira Chronicles. During missions, players select each unit using a top-down {{perspective of the}} battlefield map: once a character is selected, the player moves the character around the battlefield in third-person. A character can only act once per-turn, but characters can be granted multiple turns {{at the expense of}} other characters' turns. Each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their Action Gauge. Up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission. During gameplay, characters will call out if something happens to them, such as their health points (HP) getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks. Each character has specific [...] "Potentials", skills unique to each character. They are divided into [...] "Personal Potential", which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character, and [...] "Battle Potentials", which are grown throughout the game and always grant boons to a character. To learn Battle Potentials, each character has a unique [...] "Masters Table", a grid-based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills. Characters also have Special Abilities that grant them temporary boosts on the battlefield: Kurt can activate [...] "Direct Command" [...] and move around the battlefield without depleting his <b>Action</b> <b>Point</b> gauge, the character Reila can shift into her [...] "Valkyria Form" [...] and become invincible, while Imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon.|$|E
50|$|Each force takes {{alternating}} {{turns to}} move, attack, and perform various other actions. Each character has {{a limited amount}} of <b>action</b> <b>points,</b> which are spent to perform <b>actions.</b> The <b>action</b> <b>points</b> are renewed {{at the beginning of each}} round, depending on the physical state of the merc. Some unspent <b>action</b> <b>points</b> will also be carried over to the next round. If a combatant has some <b>action</b> <b>points</b> left over during the enemy's turn and spots an enemy, they stand a chance of interrupting the enemy turn and performing actions.|$|R
50|$|When player {{characters}} and enemies {{are in the}} same sector, the game switches to turn-based play. Both sides take turns to move and perform actions, which uses their <b>action</b> <b>points.</b> The number of <b>action</b> <b>points</b> is determined by the character's attributes. Tougher terrain surfaces on the ground use up greater numbers of <b>action</b> <b>points.</b> Interrupts are possible. Mercenaries can also crouch to make themselves a smaller target or take cover behind objects. It is possible to walk backwards and move stealthily so the mercenary can avoid being noticed by the enemy, though both of these actions uses more <b>action</b> <b>points</b> than normal moving.|$|R
5000|$|To try {{to create}} a pulp setting, Eberron uses [...] "action points" [...] that allow a player to add a six-sided die to the result of rolls made with a twenty-sided die. Characters receive a set {{allotment}} of single-use <b>action</b> <b>points</b> each character level. The Eberron Campaign Setting also includes feats which grant additional uses for <b>action</b> <b>points,</b> such as allowing a player to add an eight-sided die instead of a six-sided die, or spending two <b>action</b> <b>points</b> to grant your character an additional move or standard action. Certain class features with uses per day, like a barbarian's rage ability, a cleric's turn/rebuke undead ability, or a druid's wild shape ability, can be used again by spending 2 <b>action</b> <b>points.</b> The final use for <b>action</b> <b>points</b> is to spend one to stabilize a dying character.|$|R
2500|$|During combat segments, the Imperial Assault Force fight monsters in {{the streets}} of Tokyo using {{machines}} called Koubu. Battles take place within 3D arenas, where each unit has a full range of movement, with their distance limited by an <b>Action</b> <b>Point</b> meter: the battle system is dubbed [...] "ARMS" [...] (Active & Realtime Machine System). Each unit can perform two actions during their turn, which cover a variety of actions including attacking, healing, boosting a unit's statistics, and defending. Actions taken during LIPS sequences with members of the Flower Division directly impact battles; skillful performances during LIPS segments raise a character's Motivation, granting status increases and improving combat ability. LIPS interactions can also unlock Combination and Coalesce attacks, where two characters perform a joint attack to deal high damage to a single enemy.|$|E

Each unit has their own turn, with each turn allowing two actions. These actions include [...] "Attack", [...] "Defend", [...] "Move", [...] "Deathblow" [...] (a critical strike that kills an enemy in one hit), Charge (store energy for a more powerful action during the next turn), and Heal (which restores health points to a chosen unit). Different units specialize in different skills, such as support actions, melee attacks, or distance attacks—along with their range of movement, each unit also has an independent range in which they can perform actions. Actions taken during LIPS sequences with members of the Flower Division directly impact battles; skillful performances during LIPS segments raise a character's Motivation, granting status increases and improving combat ability.

2500|$|During {{the combat}} sequences, the player {{controls}} the New York Combat Revue as they battle demonic forces using machines dubbed Super Telekinetic Assault Robots (STARs). Battles {{take place within}} 3D arenas, where each unit has {{a full range of}} movement, with their distance limited by an <b>Action</b> <b>Point</b> meter: the battle system is dubbed [...] "ARMS" [...] (Active & Realtime Machine System). Each unit has their own turn, with each turn allowing two actions.

Different units specialize in different skills, such as support actions, melee attacks, or distance attacks—along with their range of movement, each unit also has an independent range in which they can perform actions. LIPS interactions in between combat segments raised each heroine's statistics, allowing a greater range of movement, and unlocking more powerful abilities and combination attacks. Should a character fall in battle, the relationship will suffer, weakening their future combat ability. In addition to ground-based battles, STAR units can convert into a flying form, enabling mid-air battles using identical mechanics to the ground battles.|$|E

500|$|Torn {{was to use}} a {{modified}} version of the SPECIAL system; combat occurred in quasi-real-time, rather than strictly being turn-based. To achieve this, Black Isle Studios created the [...] "recovery system", in which <b>action</b> <b>points</b> were used to determine the amount a combatant could accomplish in a given amount of time. <b>Action</b> <b>points</b> were spent with each action, and based on what percentage of an acting character's total <b>action</b> <b>points</b> were used, that character would need to wait a varying amount of time before taking action again. For example, if two characters expend half of their <b>action</b> <b>points,</b> they will attack each other at the same speed, regardless of the point totals for each character. Exceptions to this were to include recovery being hindered by movement, using items, or switching equipment, which was always allowed, though it reset the recovery time.|$|R
