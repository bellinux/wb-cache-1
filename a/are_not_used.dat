5|$|Abbreviations {{are rarely}} {{used in the}} codex. The {{handwriting}} {{is very close to}} that of the Rossano Gospels. The errors of itacism occur, but not so often as in Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus. It uses grammatical forms typical of the ancient manuscripts (e.g. ειπαν, ηλθαν, ευραν), which <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> in later medieval manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Other poems may be {{organized}} into verse paragraphs, in which regular rhymes with established rhythms <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used,</b> but the poetic tone is instead established by {{a collection of}} rhythms, alliterations, and rhymes established in paragraph form. Many medieval poems were written in verse paragraphs, even where regular rhymes and rhythms were used.|$|E
5|$|Ptychocysts <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> for prey capture— {{instead the}} threads of {{discharged}} ptychocysts {{are used for}} building protective tubes in which their owners live. Ptychocysts are found only in the order Ceriantharia, tube anemones.|$|E

5|$|Thrombolysis, stenting {{and surgery}} <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> as widely as anticoagulation or {{antiplatelet}} drugs. These treatments are invasive or more risky, and are typically reserved for situations where symptoms worsen despite medical treatment, or where medical treatment may be unsafe (e.g. an unacceptable bleeding tendency).|$|E
5|$|Audience {{etiquette}} {{is generally}} similar to formal western theatre—the audience quietly watches. Surtitles <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used,</b> but some audience members follow {{along in the}} libretto. Because there are no curtains on the stage, the performance begins with the actors entering the stage and ends with their leaving the stage. The house lights are usually kept on during the performances, creating an intimate feel that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in fall 2007 {{there will}} be more than 30 traffic cameras {{operating}} on Omaha area freeways, including one at I-80 near Gretna and another on West Dodge near 120th Street. Operated by the Nebraska Department of Roads, the sensors and cameras <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> to catch speeders or for other traffic enforcement. The state also operates an extensive traffic operations center that utilizes the cameras to monitor Omaha traffic patterns. Similar to traffic monitoring centers in Lincoln and North Platte, the one in Omaha is the biggest and has the greatest capability to provide traffic information.|$|E

5|$|Full {{capital letters}} <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> as IPA symbols. They are, however, {{often used for}} archiphonemes and for natural classes of phonemes (that is, as wildcards). Such usage {{is not part of}} the IPA or even standardized, and may be {{ambiguous}} between authors, but it is commonly used in conjunction with the IPA. (The extIPA chart, for example, uses one or two wildcards in its illustrations.) Capital letters are also basic to the Voice Quality Symbols sometimes used in conjunction with the IPA.|$|E
5|$|Lead and tin: high density; {{extremely}} close dimensional accuracy; used for special forms of corrosion resistance. Such alloys <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> in foodservice applications {{for public health}} reasons. Type metal, an alloy of lead, tin and antimony (with sometimes traces of copper) is used for casting hand-set type in letterpress printing and hot foil blocking. Traditionally cast in hand jerk moulds now predominantly die cast after the industrialisation of the type foundries. Around 1900 the slug casting machines came onto the market and added further automation, with sometimes dozens of casting machines at one newspaper office.|$|E
5|$|Needle {{receiving}} tubes: A hollow tube made of metal, shatter-resistant {{glass or}} plastic, needle receiving tubes, like forceps, {{are used to}} support the tissue at the piercing site and are common in septum and some cartilage piercings. Not only are these tubes intended to support the tissue, but they also receive the needle once it has passed through the tissue, offering protection from the sharp point. Needle receiving tubes <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> in the freehand piercing method.|$|E

5|$|Readville is a {{passenger}} rail station located slightly northwest of Wolcott Square in the Readville {{section of the}} Hyde Park neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. It serves multiple lines on the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) Commuter Rail system, {{with access to the}} Fairmount Line and Franklin Line on separate platforms. Readville is the terminus of the Fairmount Line, although a small number of rush hour trains continue through the station to and from the Franklin Line. The station has platforms in place on the Northeast Corridor, but they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> by Providence/Stoughton Line trains except during service disruptions.|$|E
5|$|Reitman needed fifty days to film Up in the Air, {{eight of}} which were devoted to aerial shooting. The aerial shots {{turned out to be}} more {{difficult}} than expected. He was unable to use three days of the aerial filming. Many aerial shots, such as the crop circle on fire, are seen in the Paramount trailer, but <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> in the film. The pilot who flies the Boeing 747 that carried the space shuttle flew the aircraft for the aerial shots.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{related to}} {{vocabulary}} development show that children's language competence depends upon {{their ability to}} hear sounds during infancy. Infants' perception of speech is distinct. Between six and ten months of age, infants can discriminate sounds used in the languages of the world. By 10 to 12 months, infants can no longer discriminate between speech sounds that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> in the language(s) {{to which they are}} exposed. Among six-month-old infants, seen articulations (i.e. the mouth movements they observe others make while talking) actually enhance their ability to discriminate sounds, and may also contribute to infants' ability to learn phonemic boundaries. Infants' phonological register is completed between the ages of 18 months and 7 years.|$|E

5|$|Taiko {{performance}} is generally taught orally and through demonstration. Historically, general patterns for taiko were written down, {{such as in}} the 1512 encyclopedia called the Taigensho, but written scores for taiko pieces are generally unavailable. One reason for the adherence to an oral tradition is that, from group to group, the rhythmic patterns in a given piece are often performed differently. Furthermore, ethnomusicologist WilliamP. Malm observed that Japanese players within a group could not usefully predict one another using written notation, and instead did so through listening. In Japan, printed parts <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> during lessons.|$|E
5|$|The {{forewings}} of beetles <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> for flight, but form elytra which {{cover the}} hind {{part of the}} body and protect the hindwings. The elytra are usually hard shell-like structures which must be raised to allow the hind wings to move for flight. However, in the soldier beetles (Cantharidae), the elytra are soft, earning this family the name of leatherwings. Other soft wing beetles include the net-winged beetle Calopteron discrepans, which has brittle wings that rupture easily in order to release chemicals for defence.|$|E
5|$|This list {{does not}} include games for Nintendo's 64DD disk drive peripheral. The list is {{initially}} organized alphabetically by their English titles or their alphabet conversions; however, {{it is also possible}} to sort each column individually. It is arranged with the different titles being listed once for each program that it contains; the various titles are listed by the majority name first. In the case of two English regions bearing a game with different names, the first version is listed first. All English titles are listed first, with an alternate title listed afterward; direct translations of English titles <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used.</b>|$|E
50|$|Almost all Protestant churches {{practice}} communion {{under both}} kinds. One marked distinction in many Protestant churches <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>using</b> a chalice for the wine, but rather individual communion cups. In some churches wine <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>used,</b> but rather grape juice (see Alcohol in Christianity).|$|R
50|$|There {{is a lack}} of Italian {{influence}} in the Maltralian dialect, unlike Standard Maltese, for example ċaw (bye) <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> but saħħa <b>is,</b> awguri <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> but nifraħlek or nixtieqlek ir-riżq are.

5|$|Traditional {{street names}} <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> in the development. The main {{thoroughfares}} are styled blue, white, pink, yellow, orange, purple and green where street furniture and coloured ambient lighting will be colour-coded to match. A stylised {{map of the}} site has been devised. Landscape architects, Gillespies regenerated the brownfield site to create public spaces. The focal point is a piazza and landscaped park, which stretches to the ship canal around which the buildings are located. The piazza's two distinct areas, The Green and The Stage are capable of holding events for up to 6500 people. In front of The Studios there is a free-standing big screen, which is viewable from the piazza.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Many birds show plumage {{patterns}} in ultraviolet that are {{invisible to the}} human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar {{to the naked eye}} are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. With the exception of pigeons and a few other species, the eyelids of birds <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten.|$|E
