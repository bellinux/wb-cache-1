40|$|Proteins of the Ras superfamily, Ras, Rac, Rho, and Cdc 42, {{control the}} remodelling of the {{cortical}} actin cytoskeleton following growth factor stimulation. A major regulator of Ras, Ras-GAP, contains several structural motifs, including an SH 3 domain and two SH 2 domains, {{and there is}} evidence that they harbor a signalling function. We have previously described a monoclonal antibody to the SH 3 domain of Ras-GAP which blocks Ras signalling in Xenopus oocytes. We now show that microinjection of this antibody into Swiss 3 T 3 cells prevents the formation of actin stress fibers stimulated by growth factors or activated Ras, but not membrane ruffling. This inhibition is bypassed by coinjection of activated Rho, suggesting that the Ras-GAP SH 3 domain is necessary for endogenous Rho activation. In agreement, the antibody blocks lysophosphatidic acid-induced neurite retraction in differentiated PC 12 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that microinjection of full-length Ras-GAP triggers stress fiber polymerization in fibroblasts in an SH 3 -dependent manner, strongly suggesting an effector function besides its role as a Ras downregulator. These results support the idea that Ras-GAP connects the Ras and Rho pathways <b>and,</b> <b>therefore,</b> <b>regulates</b> <b>the</b> actin cytoskeleton through a mechanism which probably does not involve p 190 Rho-GAP...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{contribution}} describes {{measurements of}} lipid bilayer domain line tension based on two-dimensional thermal undulations of membranes with liquid ordered/liquid disordered phase coexistence and near-critical composition at room temperature. Lateral inhomogeneity of lipid and protein composition {{is currently a}} subject of avid research aimed at determining both fundamental properties and biological relevance of membrane domains. Line tension at fluid lipid bilayer membrane domain boundaries controls the kinetics of domain growth <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>regulates</b> <b>the</b> size of compositional heterogeneities. High line tension promotes membrane domain budding and fission. Line tension could therefore be an important control parameter regulating functional aspects of biological membranes. Here the established method of fluid domain flicker spectroscopy is applied to examine thermal domain wall fluctuations of phase-separated bilayer membranes. We find a Gaussian probability distribution {{for the first few}} excited mode amplitudes, which permits an analysis by means of appropriately specialized capillary wave theory. Time autocorrelation functions are found to decay exponentially, and relaxation times are fitted by means of a hydrodynamic theory relating line tensions and excited mode relaxation kinetics. Line tensions below 1 pN are obtained, with these two approaches yielding similar results. We examine experimental artifacts that perturb the Fourier spectrum of domain traces and discuss ways to identify the number of modes that yield reliable line tension information...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2007. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 46 - 54). x, 54 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmHuman Serum Albumin (HSA) is {{the most}} abundant plasma protein that transports a variety of drugs and endogenous compounds. HSA is the primary transporter for delivering free fatty acid (FFA) to tissues and possesses at least eleven binding sites for this ligand. Although most FFAs are bound to albumin, a small fraction dissociates from the protein and exists in monomeric form within the aqueous phase, {{referred to as the}} unbound free fatty acid (uFFA). The interaction of FFA and HSA serves to buffer the level of FFA in serum <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>regulates</b> <b>the</b> rate at which FFA is transported to appropriate target cells. Since a close relationship of elevated FFA levels to the incidence of Type 2 Diabetes (T 2 D) have been shown, the HSA/FFA interactions might therefore indicate HSA's role in the pathogenesis of diabetes by modulating fatty acid availability. Most hydrophobic ligands that bind to HSA such as FFAs bind to one or two distinct high affinity binding pockets or sites in subdomains IIA and IIIA of HSA. In this study, site-directed mutagenesis and a novel protein expression system called Pichia pastoris system were used to synthesize recombinant HSA proteins with specific mutations on key amino acid residues that are involved in FFA binding on these domains. Binding affinities of recombinant HSA and mutant proteins for long chain FAs (palmitate and oleate) were determined by using a fluorescent probe composed of Acrylodan-Derivatized Intestinal Fatty Acid Binding protein (ADIFAB) FFA quantification method. The modified FFA binding affinity induced by mutations in FA binding sites of HSA may provide the rationale background for further studies associated with cellular HSAIFF A interactions and HSA polymorphism...|$|E

40|$|Human rhinoviral (RV) {{infection}} {{is a major}} trigger of exacerbations of airway diseases such as asthma and COPD. Whilst many {{studies have shown that}} RV-infected airway epithelial cells secrete many proinflammatory cytokines that may exacerbate airway inflammation, limited studies have sought to investigate the potential role of airway fibroblasts in mediating RV-induced inflammation in airway diseases. Furthermore, the signalling pathways involved in the regulation of cytokine responses of structural airway cells to RV infection remain unclear, particularly with regard to signalling via PI 3 K, and the PI 3 K-dependent pathway, autophagy. The first aim of this thesis was to investigate the innate immune responses of human airway fibroblasts to RV infection, and to compare those responses with those of airway epithelial cells. It was found that RV infection induced differential responses in normal human airway fibroblasts and epithelial cells. In comparison to airway epithelial cells, the lack of viral-detecting PRRs TLR 3, RIG-I, MDA 5 and virally-induced transcription factors IRF 1 and IRF 7 in fibroblasts may be a potential explanation as to why the fibroblasts do not secrete the IFN-stimulated cytokines CCL 5 and CXCL 10 (indicating that the RV-infected fibroblasts do not produce IFNs), therefore providing no antiviral response to limit viral replication, with concomitant cell death. The work presented here demonstrated the permissiveness of lung fibroblasts isolated from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients to RV infection. This study also showed the ability of IL- 1 Î² to enhance proinflammatory responses of RV-infected epithelial cells. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that in the presence of monocytes, RV and bacterial-derived LPS coinfections could act in synergy to augment the proinflammatory responses of airway tissue cells. The second aim of this thesis was to determine whether the PI 3 K-dependent pathway autophagy is involved in the detection of RV infection, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>regulates</b> <b>the</b> RV-induced responses of airway epithelial cells. It was found that the PI 3 K pharmacological inhibitor 3 -MA, typically used to inhibit autophagy, suppressed RV-induced cytokine production in airway epithelial cells. In contrast to the actions of 3 -MA, specific targeting of the autophagy proteins Bec 1, LC 3, Atg 7, or the autophagy-specific class III PI 3 K Vps 34 by siRNA had very modest effects on RV-induced cytokine responses. Knockdown of autophagy proteins by siRNA also had minimal effects on RV replication. However, it was found that RV infection induced autophagy in the airway epithelial cells, although additional work is required to confirm this finding. Subsequent experiments performed using a panel of broad and class I-selective PI 3 K small-molecule inhibitors demonstrated functional redundancy of class I PI 3 K isoforms in modulating the RV-induced inflammation. The PI 3 K inhibitors 3 -MA and LY 294002 also remarkably reduced viral replication, suggesting that PI 3 Ks exert their roles in controlling RV infection via multiple mechanisms. Moreover, preliminary data suggests a potential role for mTOR in regulating the proinflammatory responses to RV infection. In conclusion, the work outlined in this thesis demonstrates two major findings: (i) a potential role for lung fibroblasts in mediating airway inflammation following RV infection and (ii) the involvement of PI 3 Ks and mTOR in induction of proinflammatory cytokines in response to RV infection, and that autophagy plays a limited role in the cytokine response to RV infection or control of RV replication...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{examine the}} effects of ethanol-induced {{proteasome}} inhibition, and the effects of proteasome inhibition in the regulation of epigenetic mechanisms. METHODS: Rats were fed ethanol for 1 mo using the Tsukamoto-French model and were compared to rats given the proteasome inhibitor PS- 341 (Bortezomib, Velcadeâ¢) by intraperitoneal injection. Microarray analysis and real time PCR were performed and proteasome activity assays and Western blot analysis were performed using isolated nuclei. RESULTS: Chronic ethanol feeding caused a significant inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway in the nucleus, which led to changes in the turnover of transcriptional factors, histone-modifying enzymes, <b>and,</b> <b>therefore,</b> affected epigenetic mechanisms. Chronic ethanol feeding was related to an increase in histone acetylation, and it is hypothesized that the proteasome proteolytic activity regulated histone modifications by controlling the stability of histone modifying enzymes, <b>and,</b> <b>therefore,</b> <b>regulated</b> <b>the</b> chromatin structure, allowing easy access to chromatin by RNA polymerase, and, thus, proper gene expression. Proteasome inhibition by PS- 341 increased histone acetylation similar to chronic ethanol feeding. In addition, proteasome inhibition caused dramatic changes in hepatic remethylation reactions as there was a significant decrease in the enzymes responsible for the regeneration of S-adenosylmethionine, and, in particular, a significant decrease in the betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase enzyme. This suggested that hypomethylation was associated with proteasome inhibition, as indicated by the decrease in histone methylation. CONCLUSION: The role of proteasome inhibition in regulating epigenetic mechanisms, and its link to liver injury in alcoholic liver disease, is thus a promising approach to study liver injury due to chronic ethanol consumption...|$|R

Lysine can undergo various PTMs and thereby contribute to the regulation of different cellular processes. It can be reversibly acetylated and methylated using a pool of respective enzymes, to act as a switch for controlling the binding efficiency of RBPs. Here we have delineated the thermodynamic and kinetic effects of N-acetylation and N-monomethylation of lysine on interaction between HIV- 1 TAR RNA and its cognate binder Tat peptide (a model system). Our results indicate that acetylation of lysine 50 (K 50), leads to eight- fold reduction in binding affinity, originating exclusively from entropy changes whereas, lysine 51 (K 51) acetylation resulted only in three fold decrease with large enthalpy-entropy compensation. The measurement of kinetic parameters indicated major change (4. 5 fold) in dissociation rate in case of K 50 acetylation however, K 51 acetylation showed similar effect on both association and dissociation rates. In contrast, lysine methylation did not affect the binding affinity of Tat peptide to TAR RNA at K 50, nonetheless three fold enhancement in binding affinity was observed at K 51 position. In spite of large enthalpy-entropy compensation, lysine methylation seems to have more pronounced position specific effect on the kinetic parameters. In case of K 50 methylation, simultaneous increase was observed in the rate of association and dissociation leaving binding affinity unaffected. The increased binding affinity for methylated Tat at K 51 stems from faster association rate with slightly slower dissociation rate...|$|R

Among invertebrates, both conserved and novel, lineage specific, microRNAs have been extensively studied predominantly in holometabolous insects such as Drosophila melanogaster. However little is known about microRNA repertoires in other arthropod lineages such as the chelicerates. To understand the evolution of microRNAs in this poorly sampled subphylum, we characterized the microRNA repertoire expressed during embryogenesis of the common house spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum. We identified a total of 148 microRNAs in P. tepidariorum representing 66 families. Approximately half of these microRNA families are conserved in other metazoans, while the remainder are specific to this spider. Of the 35 conserved microRNAs families 15 had at least two copies in the P. tepidariorum genome. A BLAST based approach revealed a similar pattern of duplication in other spiders and a scorpion, but not among other chelicerates and arthropods, {{with the exception of a}} horseshoe crab. Among the duplicated microRNAs we found examples of lineage specific tandem duplications, and the duplication of entire microRNA clusters in three spiders, a scorpion, and in a horseshoe crab. Furthermore, we found that paralogs of many P. tepidariorum microRNA families exhibit arm switching, which suggests that duplication was often followed by sub- or neofunctionalization.

We found that FOG 1 is SUMOylated and phosphorylated in erythroid cells in a differentiation-dependent manner. Removal of the SUMOylation sites in FOG 1 does not impair nuclear localization, protein stability, or chromatin occupancy. However, SUMOylation of FOG 1 modulates interactions with C-terminal binding protein family members, specifically promoting CTBP 1 binding.

The present studies were undertaken {{in order to}} determine whether TSH could activate protein kinase C in vitro. Following exposure of porcine thyroid cells to TSH, translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosol to its membrane-bound form was observed. Maximal translocation occurred at the lowest TSH concentration able to trigger this response (10 mU/ml) but persisted at higher concentrations (20 â 100 mU/ml). Time-course studies revealed that translocation of protein kinase C was seen only after 40 min. TSH could also produce a similar translocation in human neutrophils (known to have TSH receptors). In thyroid cells pre-treated with TSH, modulation of phorbol-mediated protein kinase C translocation was noted. These results indicate that TSH causes the translocation of protein kinase C in porcine thyroid cells (and possibly other TSH receptor-containing cells) <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> may <b>regulate</b> <b>the</b> action of protein kinase C on differentiated thyroid function...|$|R

A {{wide variety of}} mechanisms can regulate PIP trafficking to the {{plasma membrane}} and their activity or gating. These mechanisms usually involve physical interactions of PIPs with other proteins. We are characterizing specific interactions of several PIP isoforms with key molecular interactors in the secretory pathway belonging to the syntaxin (SYP) subfamily of SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor protein attachment protein receptor) proteins. We found that the post-Golgi traffic and water channel activity of PIP proteins is regulated by SYP 121, a plasma membrane resident syntaxin involved in vesicle traffic, signaling and regulation of K+ channels. This SYP 121 -mediated regulation of PIP activity is conserved in both maize and Arabidopsis and supports the view that SYP 121 {{plays a key role}} in the regulation of the cell osmotic homeostasis. Interaction of PIPs with SYP 61, a Trans Golgi Network/Pre-Vacuolar Compartment-localized SNARE also appears to be necessary for the proper trafficking of PIPs to the plasma membrane.

This process occurs in the bone marrow of adult mammals, and generates these lineages throughout life. Furthermore, hematopoiesis is sensitive to multiple insults that drive demand for new hematopoietic cell differentiation, including infection, inflammation and myeloablation. These situations of demand alter hematopoietic differentiation to favor myeloid cell production, in {{a process known as}} emergency myelopoiesis. Both steady state hematopoiesis and emergency myelopoiesis are tightly regulated by a variety of signals in order to properly control the output of the different hematopoietic lineages. BCAP (B cell adaptor for PI- 3 kinase) is a signaling adaptor protein expressed in hematopoietic cells, where it has a wide array of functions. Here we show that BCAP is expressed in the Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor cells in the bone marrow, and acts as an inhibitor of myeloid cell development in both the steady state and during demand situations.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, a model eudicot species, the transcription factor LFY confers a floral fate to new meristems arising from {{the periphery of the}} reproductive shoot apex. Diverse orthologous LFY genes regulate vegetative-to-reproductive phase transition when expressed in Arabidopsis, a property not shared by RFL, the homolog in the agronomically important grass, rice. We have characterized RFL by knockdown of its expression and by its ectopic overexpression in transgenic rice. We find that reduction in RFL expression causes a dramatic delay in transition to flowering, with the extreme phenotype being no flowering. Conversely, RFL overexpression triggers precocious flowering. In these transgenics, the expression levels of known flowering time genes reveal RFL as a regulator of OsSOC 1 (OsMADS 50), an activator of flowering.

50|$|Prior to the {{widespread}} adoption of electronic fuel injection, most carbureted automobile engines used mechanical fuel pumps to transfer fuel from {{the fuel tank}} into the fuel bowls of the carburetor. Most mechanical fuel pumps are diaphragm pumps, which are a type of positive displacement pump. Diaphragm pumps contain a pump chamber whose volume is increased or decreased by the flexing of a flexible diaphragm, similar to the action of a piston pump. A check valve is located at both the inlet and outlet ports of the pump chamber to force the fuel to flow in one direction only. Specific designs vary, but in the most common configuration, these pumps are typically bolted onto the engine block or head, and the engine's camshaft has an extra eccentric lobe that operates a lever on the pump, either directly or via a pushrod, by pulling the diaphragm to bottom dead center. In doing so, the volume inside the pump chamber increased, causing pressure to decrease.This allows fuel to be pushed into the pump from the tank (caused by atmospheric pressure acting on the fuel in the tank). The return motion of the diaphragm to top dead center is accomplished by a diaphragm spring, during which the fuel in the pump chamber is squeezed through the outlet port and into the carburetor. The pressure at which the fuel is expelled from the pump is thus limited (<b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>regulated)</b> by <b>the</b> force applied by the diaphragm spring.|$|R

50|$|With {{the advent}} of novel {{technological}} innovations and information {{in the field of}} neuroscience, the military has begun to anticipate specific uses for such neuroscience research. However, these approaches, which can alter human cognitive abilities as well as infringe on an individualâs right to the privacy {{of his or her own}} thoughts, are still innovatory and early in development. Therefore, the precise effects and potential influence are yet to be well explained. Present day treaties, such as the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights and the Chemical Weapons Conventions, address only the use of certain chemical agents <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> cannot adequately <b>regulate</b> <b>the</b> fast-paced evolution of recent advancements in cognitive science research. Due to this ambiguity and the potential of technology misuse, it has become increasingly pressing to address the regulations needed for controlling the extent to which neuroscience research can be employed in military functions.|$|R
30|$|One of {{the most}} {{dominant}} genera in the throat is Streptococcus (yet limitations in next-generation sequencing (NGS) do not necessarily allow differentiation to a precise species) {{and it has been}} shown that some Streptococci like Streptococcus salivarius can inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacteria [51]. Thus, microbe-microbe interactions might be an important ecological mechanism in this niche. Suppressive actions of some dominant species might explain why later on, in CF patients suffering from lower airways infection with P. aeruginosa or other gram-negative pathogens, these specific pathogens are found only at low abundance in the throat. A recent study from Whiley et al. showed that the relationship between Streptococci and P. aeruginosa was highly dependent on the sequence of colonization and the environmental factors: Streptococcus could inhibit P. aeruginosa only when it was the first colonizer [52]. During the first months of life, in CF patients, Streptococcus establishes as a dominant species [14] in <b>the</b> throat <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> probably <b>regulates</b> <b>the</b> chances of infection by gram-negative bacteria in the throat. It is still unknown whether such a postulated protective effect occurs in CF patients but it is certain that it does not extend to the lower airways as gram-negative pathogens highly dominate the lung microbiome during the later stage of the disease [1]. Microbial interactions within the specific niche of the throat might result in a quite stable microbiota that is more influenced by the oral cavity and less prone to alterations even in CF patients.|$|R
40|$|International audienceUp to 850 {{billion gallons}} of {{untreated}} combined sewer overflow (CSO) is discharged into waters of the United States each year. Recent changes in CSO management policy support green infrastructure (GI) technologies as âfront of the pipeâ approaches to discharge mitigation by detention/reduction of urban stormwater runoff. Constructed wetlands for CSO treatment have been considered among suites of GI solutions. However, these wetlands differ fundamentally from other GI technologies {{in that they are}} âend of the pipeâ treatment systems that discharge from a point source, <b>and</b> are <b>therefore</b> <b>regulated</b> in <b>the</b> U. S. under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). We use a comparative regulatory analysis to examine the U. S. policy framework for CSO treatment wetlands. We find in all cases that permitting authorities have used best professional judgment to determine effluent limits and compliance monitoring requirements, referencing technology and water quality-based standards originally developed for traditional âgreyâ treatment systems. A qualitative comparison with Europe shows less stringent regulatory requirements, perhaps due to institutionalized design parameters. We recommend that permitting authorities develop technical guidance documents for evaluation of âgreenâ CSO treatment systems that account for their unique operational concerns and benefits with respect to sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|Disordered {{regions and}} Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) are {{involved}} in critical cellu-lar processes and may acquire a stable three-dimensional structure only upon binding to their partners. IDPs may follow a folding-after-binding process, known as induced folding, or a folding-before-binding process, known as conformational selection. The transcription fac-tor p 53 {{is involved in the}} regulation of cellular events that arise upon stress or DNA damage. The p 53 domain structure is composed of an N-terminal transactivation domain (p 53 TAD), a DNA Binding Domain and a tetramerization domain. The activity of TAD is tightly regu-lated by interactions with cofactors, inhibitors and phosphorylation. To initiate transcription, p 53 TAD binds to the TAZ 2 domain of CBP, a co-transcription factor, and undergoes a fold-ing and binding process, as revealed by the recent NMR structure of the complex. The activ-ity of p 53 is regulated by phosphorylation at multiple sites on the TAD domain and recent studies have shown that modifications at three residues affect the binding towards TAZ 2. However, we still do not know how these phosphorylations affect the structure of the bound state <b>and,</b> <b>therefore,</b> how they <b>regulate</b> <b>the</b> p 53 function. In this work, we have used compu...|$|R

The scope of my investigation will be thorough analysis of the clothes that are worn in Gilead, where the story takes place, whilst examining the symbolic meanings {{and the effect of}} clothing on the characters and the power structure. The Handmaidâs Tale Word count: 200, the clothes are used to solidify the new social structure of the theocratic and patriarchal republic of Gilead (formerly the United States of America), which is born {{in the late twentieth century}} <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> has to <b>regulate</b> <b>the</b> society strictly to prevent rebellions. The society is broken down into groups, and all groups are assigned some new roles and responsibilities, along with new clothes, or rather uniforms, which everyone has to wear. With these clothes, people grow into their assigned roles and easily adapt to the social structure of Gilead. With the help of symbolic meanings, the responsibilities and roles of groups are enclosed in the uniforms. In time, people lose their originality and characters and become what they wear, which is the main aim of the new âdesignsâ...|$|R
40|$|Citrus {{tristeza}} virus (CTV) is a filamentous virion (genus Closterovirus, family Closteroviridae) {{that contains}} a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 19. 3 kb consisting of 12 open reading frames (ORFs). CTV is the responsible of the current devastation of cultivated citrus trees especially of the widely used rootstock sour orange (Citrus aurantium), {{which appears to be}} one of the most susceptible species causing severe economic losses. Moreover, the relative species of trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata) appears to be resistant to the disease while, the Citrange carrizo, derived from the cross between C. sinensis L. x P. trifoliate, appears to be tolerant. The resistance to the virus is due to the presence of a locus, called Ctv locus, which is available an accurate genetic map. Eight retrotransposons, 61 Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs), more than 400 Miniature Inverted-repeats transposable Elements (mites) and several genes, with a high homology sequence to known function genes of other species are present into the Ctv locus. Among these the Ctv. 20 gene showed homology with a plant virus movement-like protein. This membrane protein is involved, through the formation of channels in plasmodesma, in the protein transfer and viral RNA movement from cell to cell. The aim of the present work was to carry out different siRNA 21 : 24 nucleotides libraries by Illumina sequencing, from susceptible plants of sour orange and tolerant of Citrange carrizo ones, both healthy and infected with different strains of CTV virus. The presence of a homologous locus in susceptible species such as Citrus aurantium suggests that the mechanisms of resistance <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> of <b>regulating</b> <b>the</b> expression of the genes present in the locus cannot be fully explained by DNA sequence alone. On this basis we moved to verify the role of siRNA through an epigenetic regulation of the methylation status of Ctv locus. The difference between methylated and unmethylated condition in tolerant and susceptible plants was performed by PCR analysis on DNA digested by sensitive and unsensitive enzymes to cytosine methylatio...|$|R
