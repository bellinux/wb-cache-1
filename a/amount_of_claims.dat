The aim of this project is to develop the Insurance Management System for Insurans Hayat dan Am (IHA) Agency. Next, the objectives of this project are to gather and analyzed requirements from IHA Agency, to design an IMS and to develop an IMS. Currently, the agency has faced problem to manage data entry, not able to answer customer’s question about the estimation <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> and send message to customer manually. This system may able to reduce the current problem of the insurance management. Mainly, this system is focused on calculate estimation <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim.</b> Other than that, this system also able to generate SMS to alert customer about their payment. Methodology that applied for this project is Waterfall Model. There are three (3) phases involved in this project. The first phase is gathered and analyzed the requirements. Meanwhile, second phase is system design and last phase is system development. The programming language that used for this system is Java language while SQL Developer is used to store the data of the system. This system are benefits to the admin and staff as it assists in insurance management. The future enhancement of this system is to connect with any insurance company and enlarge {{the scope of the}} system.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 13.7% of all water used in the home today {{can be attributed to}} plumbing leaks. [...] On average that is approximately 10,000 gallons of water per year wasted by leaks for each US home. A tiny, 1/8-inch crack in a pipe can release up to 250 gallons of water a day. According to Claims Magazine in August 2000, broken water pipes ranked second to hurricanes in terms of both the number of homes damaged and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> (on average $50,000 per insurance claim) costs in the US. Experts suggest that homeowners inspect and replace worn pipe fittings and hose connections to all household appliances that use water at least once a year. This includes washing machines, dishwashers, kitchen sinks and bathroom lavatories, refrigerator icemakers, water softeners and humidifiers. A few US companies offer whole-house leak protection systems utilizing flow-based technologies. A number of insurance companies offer policy holders reduced rates for installing a whole-house leak protection system.|$|E
