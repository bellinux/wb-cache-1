30|$|Our {{paper is}} {{organized}} in three big sections. In the first section, we study general <b>almost</b> periodic functions <b>and</b> asymptotically <b>almost</b> periodic ones. In the second section, {{we deal with}} the Stepanov generalization for <b>almost</b> periodicity <b>and</b> asymptotic <b>almost</b> periodicity. Then, Weyl <b>almost</b> periodic functions <b>and</b> asymptotically <b>almost</b> periodic functions are considered. These sections are mutually closely connected since we analyze some comparison relations linking the different functional spaces defined in each paragraph.|$|R

5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, the economy went into decline and the population quickly started to decrease. Between 1989 and 2002, Murmansk Oblast lost almost a quarter of its population; <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> 100,000 more between 2002 and 2010. Nevertheless, the economy rebounded somewhat {{in the first decade of}} the 2000s and the peninsula remains the most industrially developed and urbanized region in northern Russia.|$|E
5|$|After trucks {{became popular}} in the 1910s, the Omaha Stockyards grew exponentially. Cattle, hogs and sheep were shipped cheaper by truck than by trains.

In 1955 the Stockyards became the biggest livestock distribution center in the United States, <b>and</b> <b>almost</b> all of the cattle was shipped by truck.|$|E

30|$|The idea {{of almost}} {{convergence}} was presented by Lorentz in 1948 [1] and has various applications. Several authors, including Ahmad and Mursaleen [2], Lorentz [1], King [3], Mohapatra [4, 5], Nanda [6], and other authors [7 – 10] {{have concentrated on}} almost convergent sequences. As convergence motivates us to study absolute and strong convergence, similarly it was very common to study the ideas of absolute <b>almost</b> <b>and</b> strong <b>almost</b> convergence after the concept of almost convergence. These two concepts of absolute <b>almost</b> <b>and</b> strongly <b>almost</b> convergent sequences have been examined in [11] and [12], respectively.|$|R

This seems to reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in the depiction of a body under clothing.|$|E
