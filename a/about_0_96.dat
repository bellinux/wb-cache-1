40|$|November 2004 (Revised from April 2003). We {{estimate}} the incentive effects of income taxation in a life-cycle model of consumption and labor supply that relaxes the standard assumption of strong separability within periods. Our model permits identification of both within-period preference parameters and life-cycle preference parameters {{such as the}} inter-temporal substitution elasticity. Results indicate that consumption and hours worked are direct complements in utility, and both increase {{with an increase in}} the after-tax share and with a compensated increase in the net wage. The compensated net wage elasticity is <b>about</b> <b>0.</b> 3, nearly double the standard estimates for men in the United States that ignore within-period non-separability between consumption and hours and rely on linear preferences.

O etefom acelerou a deiscência dos capuchos do algodoeiro a partir da dose 1, 44 kg/ha, o que não se observou para o tidiazurom. Os resultados indicaram que os produtos, quando aplicados conjuntamente, não possuem ação antagônica. Os diversos tratamentos não diferiram estatisticamente entre si na produção de algodão.

40|$|Journal of Oceanography, Oceanographic Society of Japan, 67 A new maximum angle {{method has}} been {{developed}} to determine surface mixed-layer (a 19 general name for isothermal/constant-density layer) depth from profile data. It has three steps 20 (1) fitting the profile data with a first vector (pointing downward) from a depth to an upper level 21 and a second vector (pointing downward) from that depth to a deeper level, (2) identifying the 22 angle (varying with depth) between the two vectors, (3) finding the depth (i. e., the mixed layer 23 depth) with maximum angle between the two vectors. Temperature and potential density profiles 24 collected from two seagliders in the Gulf Stream near Florida coast during 14 November ? 5 25 December 2007 were used to demonstrate its capability. The quality index (1. 0 for perfect 26 identification) of the maximum angle method is <b>about</b> <b>0.</b> <b>96.</b> The isothermal layer depth is 27 generally larger than the constant-density layer depth, i. e., the barrier layer occurs during the 28 study period. Comparison with the existing difference, gradient, and curvature criteria shows the 29 advantage of using the maximum angle method. Uncertainty due to varying threshold using the 30 difference method is also presented...|$|E
40|$|Field {{extrapolation}} is {{an alternative}} method to study chromospheric and coronal magnetic fields. In this paper, two semi-analytical solutions of force- free fields (Low and Lou, 1990) {{have been used to}} study the errors of nonlin- ear force-free (NLFF) fields based on force-free factor alpha. Three NLFF fields are extrapolated by approximate vertical integration (AVI) Song et al. (2006), boundary integral equation (BIE) Yan and Sakurai (2000) and optimization (Opt.) Wiegelmann (2004) methods. Compared with the first semi-analytical field, it is found that the mean values of absolute relative standard deviations (RSD) of alpha along field lines are <b>about</b> <b>0.</b> <b>96</b> - 1. 05, 0. 94 - 1. 07 and 0. 46 - 0. 72 for AVI, BIE and Opt. fields, respectively. While for the second semi-analytical field, they are about 0. 80 - 1. 02, 0. 63 - 1. 34 and 0. 33 - 0. 55 for AVI, BIE and Opt. fields, respectively. As for the analytical field, the calculation error of hjRSDji is about 0. 1 0. 2. It is also found that RSD does not apparently depend on the length of field line. These provide the basic estimation on the deviation of extrapolated field obtained by proposed methods from the real force-free field.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relation}} between illiquidity level and illiquidity risk and the size, value and momentum anomalies for US stocks 1931 - 2012. In contrast to statistical factors both illiquidity level and illiquidity risk have a solid theoretical foundation in the liquidity adjusted capital asset pricing model (LCAPM). A horse race between the LCAPM and the CAPM shows that the LCAPM outperforms the CAPM in terms of ability to explain risk premiums of size and value sorted test portfolios. The outrun comes mostly from the illiquidity level premium while the illiquidity risk premium is overall less important. We 8 ̆ 5 nd a very strong correlation between Fama-French size betas and illiquidity level betas (<b>about</b> <b>0.</b> <b>96)</b> and a fairly strong correlation between Fama-French value betas and illiquidity risk betas (about 0. 56) while Carharts momentum beta has high negative correlation with betas both for illiquidity level and risk (- 0. 76 and- 0. 94 respectively). The premiums related to size can to large extent be explained as a compensation for illiquidity level. The premiums related to momentum are essentially explained by the high illiquidity (both level and risk) of the portfolios with little momentum. The premiums related to value can to some extent be interpreted as compensation for illiquidity risk {{and to some extent}} as compensation for illiquidity level but cannot fully explain the value anomaly...|$|E
40|$|MnCoGe-based {{compounds}} are {{of interest}} {{with respect to the}} magnetocaloric effect due to a martensitic phase transition from the low-temperature orthorhombic phase to the high-temperature hexagonal phase. A key feature is that the transition temperature can be readily tuned to obtain a magneto-structural transition. Fe is an effective substitute for Mn or Co to stabilize the hexagonal phase at low temperature. Here we present initial 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy measurements on (Mn <b>0.</b> <b>96</b> Fe <b>0.</b> 04) CoGe and Mn(Co <b>0.</b> <b>96</b> Fe <b>0.</b> 04) Ge samples doped with 0. 5 wt % 57 Fe. The martensitic transition temperatures were determined to be 239 K and 304 K with transition full widths at half maximum of 44 K and 39 K respectively as determined from x-ray diffraction experiments over the temperature range 10 – 310 K. The magnetic properties were studied over the temperature range 5 – 300 K and a magneto-structural transition found in Mn(Co <b>0.</b> <b>96</b> Fe <b>0.</b> 04) Ge. Analysis of the 20 K Mössbauer spectra reveals that the Fe atoms are distributed on both the Mn and Co sites and tend to prefer to occupy the Co site in both the (Mn <b>0.</b> <b>96</b> Fe <b>0.</b> 04) CoGe and Mn(Co <b>0.</b> <b>96</b> Fe <b>0.</b> 04) Ge samples.

40|$|New minimal {{invasive}} diagnostic {{methods for}} {{early detection of}} lung cancer are urgently needed. It is known that the immune system responds to tumors with production of tumor-autoantibodies. Protein microarrays are a suitable highly multiplexed platform for identification of autoantibody signatures against tumor-associated antigens (TAA). These microarrays can be probed using 0. 1 mg immunoglobulin G (IgG), purified from 10 µL of plasma. We used a microarray comprising recombinant proteins derived from 15, 417 cDNA clones for the screening of 100 lung cancer samples, including 25 samples of each main histological entity of lung cancer, and 100 controls. Since this number of samples cannot be processed at once, the resulting data showed non-biological variances due to “batch effects”. Our aim was to evaluate quantile normalization, “distance-weighted discrimination” (DWD), and “ComBat” for their effectiveness in data pre-processing for elucidating diagnostic immune‑signatures. “ComBat” data adjustment outperformed the other methods and allowed us to identify classifiers for all lung cancer cases versus controls and small-cell, squamous cell, large-cell, and adenocarcinoma of the lung with an accuracy of 85 %, 94 %, 96 %, 92 %, and 83 % (sensitivity of 0. 85, <b>0.</b> 92, <b>0.</b> <b>96,</b> <b>0.</b> 88, 0. 83; specificity of <b>0.</b> 85, <b>0.</b> <b>96,</b> <b>0.</b> <b>96,</b> <b>0.</b> <b>96,</b> <b>0.</b> 83), respectively.
