5|$|An <b>Apollo</b> 1 mission patch {{was left}} on the Moon's surface after the first manned lunar landing by <b>Apollo</b> 11 crew members Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. The <b>Apollo</b> 15 mission {{left on the}} surface of the Moon a tiny {{memorial}} statue, Fallen Astronaut, along with a plaque containing the names of the <b>Apollo</b> 1 astronauts, among others including Soviet cosmonauts, who perished in the pursuit of human space flight.|$|E
5|$|<b>Apollo</b> 16 was {{the second}} of the <b>Apollo</b> type J missions, {{featuring}} the use of the Lunar Roving Vehicle, increased scientific capability, and lunar surface stays of three days. As <b>Apollo</b> 16 was the penultimate mission in the <b>Apollo</b> program and there was no new hardware or procedures to test on the lunar surface, the last two missions (the other being <b>Apollo</b> 17) presented opportunities for astronauts to clear up some uncertainties in understanding the Moon's properties. Although previous <b>Apollo</b> expeditions, including <b>Apollo</b> 14 and <b>Apollo</b> 15, obtained samples of pre-mare lunar material, before lava began to upwell from the Moon's interior and flood the low areas and basins, none had actually visited the lunar highlands.|$|E
5|$|As <b>Apollo</b> 14 was {{an early}} <b>Apollo</b> mission, landing sites were {{restricted}} to equatorial regions for technical reasons. After <b>Apollo</b> 12 demonstrated the ability to land at a pre-specified landing zone, mission planners considered landings in rough, but geologically interesting areas of the Moon.|$|E
40|$|This article aims to {{contribute}} to our knowledge of informal urban singing culture in the Netherlands, especially {{within the context of}} youth subcultures. Hundreds of songbooks from the period of the Dutch Republic (the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) evidence such a singing culture. In this article I will focus on a hitherto lesser known complex of popular secular songbooks {{from the middle of the}} eighteenth century, which will be referred to as <b>Apollo’s</b> gifts. The first songbook in this series is <b>Apollo’s</b> Kermis-gift (<b>Apollo’s</b> Kermesse gift), published in The Hague in 1740 by Jan van den Bergh and followed by two sequels. Other books of the series are <b>Apollo’s</b> St. Nicolaas gift (<b>Apollo’s</b> St. Nicholas gift; Leiden 1741), <b>Apollo’s</b> Nieuwe-Jaers-gift (<b>Apollo’s</b> New Year gift; The Hague 1742), and <b>Apollo’s</b> Vastenavond-gift (<b>Apollo’s</b> Carnival gift; The Hague 1745). They remind us of the important function of informal public singing at annual feasts such as the Kermesse, New Year’s, St. Nicholas and Carnival. The entire population participated in such celebrations, including the elite and the middle classes who imitated the elite, as can be deduced from the songbooks. <b>Apollo’s</b> gifts also reminds us that these feasts were not merely folklore in the countryside but also a part of urban daily life. ...|$|R

5|$|Manned <b>Apollo</b> {{flights were}} {{suspended}} for 20 months while the Command Module's hazards were addressed. However, {{the development and}} unmanned testing of the Lunar Module (LM) and Saturn V Moon rocket continued. The Saturn IB launch vehicle for <b>Apollo</b> 1, AS-204, {{was used for the}} first LM test flight, <b>Apollo</b> 5.

5|$|Mattingly had {{originally}} been assigned to the prime crew of <b>Apollo</b> 13, but was exposed to the measles through Duke, at that time on the back-up crew for <b>Apollo</b> 13, who had caught it {{from one of his}} children. He never contracted the illness, but was nevertheless removed from the crew and replaced by his backup, Jack Swigert, three days before the launch. Young, a captain in the United States Navy, had flown on three spaceflights prior to <b>Apollo</b> 16: Gemini 3, Gemini 10 and <b>Apollo</b> 10, which orbited the Moon. One of 19 astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966, Duke had never flown in space before <b>Apollo</b> 16. He served on the support crew of <b>Apollo</b> 10 and was a Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) for <b>Apollo</b> 11.|$|E

5|$|Neither Shepard nor Lovell {{expected}} {{there would}} be much difference between <b>Apollo</b> 13 and <b>Apollo</b> 14, but <b>Apollo</b> 13 went disastrously wrong. An oxygen tank explosion nearly resulted {{in the loss of}} the crew, and the moon landing was aborted. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who would offer to give Shepard back the mission each time they bumped into each other. The failure of <b>Apollo</b> 13 delayed <b>Apollo</b> 14 until 1971 so that modifications could be made to the spacecraft. The target of the <b>Apollo</b> 14 mission was switched to the Fra Mauro formation, the intended destination of <b>Apollo</b> 13.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Apollo</b> program, {{or certain}} missions, have been dramatized in <b>Apollo</b> 13 (1995), <b>Apollo</b> 11 (1996), From the Earth to the Moon (1998), The Dish (2000), Space Race (2005), and Moonshot (2009).|$|E
5|$|When Slayton {{submitted}} the proposed crew assignments to NASA headquarters, George Mueller turned {{them down on}} the grounds that the crew was too inexperienced. So Slayton asked Jim Lovell, who had been the backup commander for <b>Apollo</b> 11, and was slated to command <b>Apollo</b> 14, if his crew would be willing to fly <b>Apollo</b> 13 instead. He agreed to do so, and Shepard's inexperienced crew was assigned to <b>Apollo</b> 14.|$|E

5|$|After the accident, NASA {{decided to}} give the flight the {{official}} designation of <b>Apollo</b> 1 and then skip to <b>Apollo</b> 4 for the first unmanned orbital test of the CSM, counting the two unmanned suborbital tests AS-201 and 202 {{as part of the}} sequence. The spacecraft problems were corrected, and the <b>Apollo</b> program carried on to reach its objective of landing men on the Moon successfully.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} spacecraft, the Gemini Lunar Surface Survival Shelter, {{was designed}} to be sent to the Moon ahead of an <b>Apollo</b> mission. It would have landed close to the planned <b>Apollo</b> landing site, and if the <b>Apollo</b> Lunar Module's ascent stage failed to ignite, the crew would have performed an EVA to transfer to the LSSS. The shelter was not designed to take off again after landing, so an LSRS or another <b>Apollo</b> mission would then be sent to collect the crew, whilst the Command Module Pilot of the original <b>Apollo</b> mission would have returned to Earth alone aboard his spacecraft. It consisted of a Gemini Reentry Module, which would have housed the astronauts whilst they awaited rescue, and a descent stage containing life support systems, consumables, and the engine and propellant used to land the spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|<b>Apollo</b> 14 {{had visited}} and sampled a ridge of {{material}} that had been ejected by the impact that created the Mare Imbrium impact basin. Likewise, <b>Apollo</b> 15 had also sampled material {{in the region of}} Imbrium, visiting the basin's edge. There remained the possibility, because the <b>Apollo</b> 14 and <b>Apollo</b> 15 landing sites were closely associated with the Imbrium basin, that different geologic processes were prevalent in areas of the lunar highlands far from Mare Imbrium. Several members of the scientific community remarked that the central lunar highlands resembled regions on Earth that were created by volcanic processes and hypothesized the same might be true on the Moon. They had hoped that scientific output from the <b>Apollo</b> 16 mission would provide an answer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Apollo</b> 17 was {{the last}} of the <b>Apollo</b> program, landing in the Taurus-Littrow region in December 1972. Eugene Cernan {{commanded}} Ronald E. Evans and NASA's first scientist-astronaut, geologist Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt. Schmitt was originally scheduled for <b>Apollo</b> 18, but the lunar geological community lobbied for his inclusion on the final lunar landing. Cernan and Schmitt stayed on the surface for just over three days and spent just over 23 hours of total EVA.|$|E
5|$|<b>Apollo</b> set major {{milestones}} {{in human}} spaceflight. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit, and landing humans on another celestial body. <b>Apollo</b> 8 {{was the first}} manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while <b>Apollo</b> 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low Earth orbit to date. The program spurred advances {{in many areas of}} technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. <b>Apollo</b> sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. Many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.|$|E
