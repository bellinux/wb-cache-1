5|$|As, {{according}} to Bulgarian mythology {{and some other}} traditions, tortoises were the only beings who knew {{the appearance of the}} herb and the location where it grows, such people would try to obtain the raskovnik by deceiving a tortoise. They would find a tortoise nesting site and hem it in with a fence while the tortoise is away. When it returns, the tortoise would be unable to access its eggs, so it would return with a raskovnik in order to breach the fence. Thus, the tortoise would reveal the herb <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> acquire it from the tortoise, which does not need it anymore.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} decade, {{the casino}} began exhibiting burlesque and vaudeville acts to draw crowds, and a raised stage was installed for the live performances. The building eventually became village property, and housed the town's fire house. Known as Firemen's Hall, {{the building was}} also used by the town's fire department as a basketball court. Basketball was extremely popular in Rosendale in the 1940s. On Friday nights the Firemen's Hall became a dance hall, <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> sometimes square dance in formal attire.|$|E
25|$|During the period, {{a segment}} of the {{population}} began to demonstrate an increasingly less conciliatory policy towards the Jews. The Jewish population reacted by siding with the Greek monarchists during the Greek National Schism (opposing Eleftherios Venizelos, who had the overwhelming support of refugees and the lower income classes). This would {{set the stage for a}} 20-year period during which the relationship of the Jews with the Greek state <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> oscillate as Greek politics changed.|$|E

25|$|The {{events in}} a life script are often positive, celebrated, and normative. It {{represents}} and idealized life story. An average life would also include negative events <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> learn from experience. But the life script is handed down from older generations, through stories, and observations {{of the behavior of}} others, typically older, people within the same culture. Individuals should also remember more during their young adulthood because that era is the time of biological maturation, new experiences, adult identity formation, and major events in life scripts.|$|E
25|$|For {{at least}} {{ten years after the}} wreck, the imprint of Jones' engine was clearly visible in the {{embankment}} {{on the east side of}} the tracks about two-tenths of a mile north of Tucker's Creek, which is where the marker was located. The imprint of the headlight, boiler and the spokes of the wheels could be seen <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> ride up on handcars to view the traces of the famous wreck. Corn that was scattered by the wreck grew for years afterward in the surrounding fields.|$|E
25|$|The {{excursions}} sometimes {{evolved into}} rowdy gatherings and legislation was passed to prevent this. A commission established in 1805 issued instructions which prohibited {{the consumption of}} food or drink as well as music or {{any other kind of}} cheerful behaviour in the cemetery. The gravediggers, who lived on the premises, were to enforce these restrictions but they seem to have taken their duties lightly. Legislation from 1813 prohibited them to sell alcohol to visitors to the cemetery. Despite all these efforts, the desired peace and quiet was a long time in coming. For particularly grand funerals, crowds of spectators would gather, <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> festoon the cemetery walls to get a better view. To reduce numbers of visitors, there was talk of introducing admission fees, but this was never carried out.|$|E

500|$|Chinese {{emperors}} used caracals as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, Yuan dynasty rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs and tigers from Muslim {{merchants in}} the western parts of the empire in return for gold, silver, cash and silk. According to the Ming Shilu, the subsequent Ming dynasty continued this practice. Until {{as recently as the}} 20th century, the caracal was used in hunts by Indian rulers to hunt small game, while the cheetah was used for larger game. In those times, caracals would be exposed to a flock of pigeons <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> bet on which caracal would kill the largest number of pigeons. This probably gave rise to the expression [...] "to put the cat among the pigeons".|$|E
500|$|The first table read of {{the episode}} was held on January 9, 1991. The episode was filmed {{in front of a}} live {{audience}} on January 15, 1991. Filming {{of the episode}} took place at the CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California, where, starting with the season premiere [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend", filming of all the show's episodes took place. A few scenes were changed prior to the filming of the episode. The scene in which Jerry informs George he told Elaine about the apartment initially showed them standing in line for the movies, talking about sitting {{in the front of the}} theatre. George would tell Jerry that he once pretended to have a grotesque physical impairment while he was standing in line to get a ticket for The Exorcist (1973), <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> let him go in front of them without saying anything. The location of this scene, however, was changed to Monk's Cafe, a regular hangout for the show's main characters, and George and Jerry's dialogue was shortened. In the original script, Jerry, instead of George, proclaimed himself [...] "lord of the idiots", but this was changed during rehearsals.|$|E
500|$|While {{there are}} not many {{accounts}} of early courts in Alder Gulch, probably due to their informality and short existence, John X. Beidler recalled a murder trial in the Virginia City miners' court in his memoirs. The trial recalled by Beidler occurred in the fall of 1863. It concerned the matter of the murder of J.W. Dillingham. [...] The trial was held outside, {{due to the fact that}} every resident took part. In the end all three defendants were set free. The first, Charley Forbes, was freed after he gave an eloquent and sentimental speech about his mother. [...] The other two, Buck Stinson and Haze Lyons, were convicted and set to be the first men executed in what would become the state of Montana. [...] However, at what would be a very public hanging friends and sympathizers of Stinson and Lyons convinced the crowd to vote again on the execution. [...] Two attempts at counting the vote were made according to Beidler. The first people voting 'hang' were to walk up-hill while those voting 'no hang' were to walk down-hill. [...] This vote was rejected and the next attempt had four men form two gates <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> cast their vote by walking through the 'hang' gate or the 'no hang' gate. [...] Beidler claims that friends of the condemned men simply walked through the 'no hang' gate multiple times casting multiple fraudulent votes that possibly allowed two murderers to walk free.|$|E

5000|$|In linguistics, {{referential}} indeterminacy is {{a situation}} in which different people vary in naming objects.

500|$|In 1968 he {{ran against}} the 81-year-old {{incumbent}} Democratic Senator Ernest Gruening, a popular {{former governor of}} the Alaska Territory who {{was considered one of}} the fathers of Alaska's statehood, for his party's nomination to the U.S. Senate. Gravel's campaign was primarily based on his youth rather than issue differences. He hired Joseph Napolitan, the first self-described political consultant, in late 1966. They spent over {{a year and a half}} planning a short, nine-day primary election campaign that featured the slogans [...] "Alaska first" [...] and [...] "Let's do something about the state we're in", the distribution of a collection of essays entitled Jobs and More Jobs, and the creation of a half-hour, well-produced, glamorized biographical film of Gravel, Man for Alaska. The film was shown twice a day on every television station in Alaska and carried by plane and shown on home projectors in hundreds of Alaska Native villages. The heavy showings quickly reversed a 2–to–1 Gruening lead in polls into a Gravel lead. Gravel visited many remote villages by seaplane and showed a thorough understanding of the needs of the bush country and the fishing and oil industries. Gravel also benefited by being deliberately ambiguous about his Vietnam policy. Gruening had been one of only two Senators to vote against the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and his opposition to President Lyndon B. Johnson's war policies was harming him among the Democratic electorate; according to Gravel, [...] "...all I had to do was stand up and not deal with the subject, <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> assume that I was to the right of Ernest Gruening, when in point of fact I was to the left of him." ...|$|E
