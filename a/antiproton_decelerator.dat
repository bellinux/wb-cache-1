5000|$|The Low Energy Antiproton Ring (LEAR), {{commissioned}} in 1982, which {{assembled the}} first pieces of true antimatter, in 1995, consisting of nine atoms of antihydrogen. It was closed in 1996, and superseded by the <b>Antiproton</b> <b>Decelerator.</b>|$|E
50|$|Subsequently, CERN {{built the}} <b>Antiproton</b> <b>Decelerator</b> (AD) to support efforts towards {{low-energy}} antihydrogen, for tests of fundamental symmetries. The AD will supply several CERN groups. CERN expects their facilities will {{be capable of}} producing 10 million antiprotons per minute.|$|E
50|$|ATHENA was an {{antimatter}} {{research project}} {{that took place}} at the <b>Antiproton</b> <b>Decelerator.</b> In August 2002, it was the first experiment to produce 50,000 low-energy antihydrogen atoms, as reported in Nature. In 2005, ATHENA was disbanded and many of the former members worked on the subsequent ALPHA experiment.|$|E
50|$|After {{the last}} {{run of the}} SpS, in 1991, LEAR {{remained}} the sole client of the AAC, and a simpler way to serve low-energy physics was sought. LEAR was converted to become the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR), the AA was dismantled, and the AC was converted to become the <b>Antiproton</b> <b>Decelerator</b> (AD).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Antiproton</b> <b>Decelerator</b> (AD) is {{a storage}} ring at the CERN {{laboratory}} near Geneva. It was {{built as a}} successor to the Low Energy Antiproton Ring (LEAR) and started operation in the year 2000. Antiprotons are created by impinging a proton beam from the Proton Synchrotron on a metal target. The AD decelerates the resultant antiprotons to an energy of 5.3 MeV, which are then ejected to one of several connected experiments.|$|E
5000|$|Antiprotons are {{received}} by the <b>Antiproton</b> <b>Decelerator</b> and are 'mixed' with positrons from a specially-designed positron accumulator in a versatile Penning trap.

50|$|His {{prolific}} inventiveness to {{the whole}} park of accelerators at CERN that run so well today for physics, whether they might be for neutrinos sent to Gran Sasso, colliding proton beams at the LHC, or antiproton physics at the <b>Antiproton</b> <b>Decelerator</b> (AD), owe him an immense amount of gratitude.Likewise, the Fermilab antiproton programme that has been running since 1983-85 and the successes of the p-pbar Tevatron Collider up to 2011 and its discovery of the top quark, owe him considerable gratitude.|$|E
50|$|Since 2010 the {{production}} of cold antihydrogen has become possible at the <b>Antiproton</b> <b>Decelerator</b> at CERN. Antihydrogen, which is electrically neutral, should {{make it possible to}} directly measure the gravitational attraction of antimatter particles to the matter Earth. In 2013, experiments on antihydrogen atoms released from the ALPHA trap set direct, i.e. freefall, coarse limits on antimatter gravity. These limits were coarse, with a relative precision of ± 100%, thus far from a clear statement even for the sign of gravity acting on antimatter. Future experiments at CERN with beams of antihydrogen, such as AEGIS and GBAR, or with trapped antihydrogen such as ALPHA, have to improve the sensitivity to make a clear, scientific statement about gravity on antimatter.|$|E
50|$|AEgIS {{would attempt}} to {{determine}} if gravity affects antimatter {{in the same way}} it affects matter by testing its effect on an antihydrogen beam. The first phase of the experiment creates antihydrogen: antiprotons from the <b>Antiproton</b> <b>Decelerator</b> are coupled with positrons, making a pulse of horizontally-travelling antihydrogen atoms. These atoms are sent through a series of diffraction gratings, ultimately hitting a surface and thus annihilating. The points where the antihydrogen annihilates are measured with a precise detector. Areas behind the gratings are shadowed, while those behind the slits are not. The annihilation points reproduce a periodic pattern of light and shadowed areas. Using this pattern, it can be measured how many atoms of different velocities drop during horizontal flight. Therefore, the Earth's gravitational force on antihydrogen can be determined. It was originally proposed in 2007. Construction of the main apparatus was completed in 2012.|$|E
5000|$|In reality, {{however, the}} few known physics {{reactions}} for producing antimatter involve particle accelerators or particle bombardment, but are both currently highly inefficient and prohibitively expensive. The global production rate per year is only 1 to 10 nanograms. In 2008, the annual production of antiprotons at the <b>Antiproton</b> <b>Decelerator</b> facility of CERN was several picograms {{at a cost}} of US$20 million. Thus, at the current level of production, an equivalent of a 10 Mt hydrogen bomb, about 250 grams of antimatter will take 2.5 billion years of the energy production of the entire Earth to produce. [...] A milligram of antimatter will take 100,000 times the annual production rate to produce (or 100,000 years). For example, an equivalent of the Hiroshima atomic bomb would take half a gram of antimatter, but would take CERN two million years to produce at the current production rate.|$|E
5000|$|Gabrielse was {{a pioneer}} in the field of low energy {{antiproton}} and antihydrogen physics by proposing the trapping of antiprotons from a storage ring, cooling them in collisions with trapped electrons, and the use of these to form low energy antihydrogen atoms. [...] He led the TRAP team that realized the first antiproton trapping, the first electron cooling of trapped antiprotons, and the accumulation of antiprotons in a 4 Kelvin apparatus. [...] The demonstrations and methods made possible an effort that grew to involve 4 international collaborations of physicists working at CERN's <b>Antiproton</b> <b>Decelerator.</b> In 1999, Gabrielse's TRAP team made the most precise test of the Standard Model's fundamental CPT theorem by comparing the charge-to-mass ratio of a single trapped antiproton with that of a proton to a precision of 9 parts in 1011. The precision of the resulting confirmation of the Standard Model prediction exceeded that of earlier comparisons by nearly a factor of 106.|$|E

40|$|Central to {{the control}} and {{operation}} of the CERN <b>Antiproton</b> <b>Decelerator</b> (AD) is the deceleration cycle which involves accelerator sub-systems such as magnet current, timing, RF systems etc. It is fundamental to AD operation that these sub-system cycles are coherent and an integrated AD Cycle Editor has been proposed to guarantee this coherence. In the object oriented model of the AD, {{the highest level of}} abstraction is the class &quot;AD Cycle &quot; which is described in physical terms with an associated set of operations. The accelerator sub-systems inherit from this class thus guaranteeing coherence. The model is implemented in the AD Cycle Editor, which acts on the AD Cycle class and implicitly therefore also on the sub-systems. In this paper the model of the AD Cycle and sub-systems are discussed. The AD Cycle Editor is also presented with comments on the results of the commissioned system. 1 <b>ANTIPROTON</b> <b>DECELERATOR</b> The CERN <b>Antiproton</b> <b>Decelerator</b> (AD) [1] is a circular accelerator that decelerates protons or antiprotons from 3. 57 GeV/c down to 100 MeV/c through intermediate levels at 2. 0 GeV/c and 300 MeV/c.
