40|$|Tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing</b> {{has got the}} {{interest}} of ERP vendors. Tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing</b> {{is concerned with the}} monitoring and registering of data on goods in the supply chain and the reconstruction of product history. Incorporating tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing</b> functionality in ERP software is of particular interest to vendors. Amongst others, tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing</b> enables ERP customers to optimize process performance with respect to recall management and may also offer better protection against product liability. This paper focuses particularly on tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing</b> in semi-process industry. A description is given of the functional requirements for tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing,</b> derived from ERP customers in the Netherlands. Some reference structures are generated to extend existing ERP data models with. Surprisingly, from these structures, a design pattern emerges. Illustrative hereof is the modeling of the bill-of-lots and the bill-of-batches: analogous to the bill-of-materials...|$|R
40|$|Although {{government}} and business interest in tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing</b> has grown enormously over the last decade, a clear and coherent overview of the topic is still lacking and is not found in (logistics) literature. This article presents a structure for development and contemporary practices of tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing.</b> The development structure is conceptualised by three supply-chain layers: item coding (the physical layer), information architecture (the information layer); and planning and control (the control layer). On behalf of tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing,</b> the layers represent different levels of supply-chain integration. The conceptualisation is derived from similar ideas found in literature on supply-chain management. From a scientific point of view, the structure provides a coherent and systematic organisation of tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing</b> concepts. From the viewpoint of business administration, the structure facilitates {{the determination of the}} scope of tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing</b> application(s), which is of management value...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} and analyse, by means of in-depth case study, opportunities offered by sharing rail-wagon tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing</b> data for operations of actors of an automotive Supply Chain (SC). The study shows that sharing data via a wagon tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing</b> system provides opportunities for traffi c authorities to better monitor infrastructure usage. This will lead to improved maintenance procedures by transport operators and, further, will enable the tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing</b> of containers <b>and</b> pallets demanded by transport customers. This research provides guidelines for the adoption of Radio Frequency Identifi cation (RFID) for vehicle tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing,</b> especially in rail logistics. New opportunities created by the auto-identifi cation of rail wagons and sharing of tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing</b> data are not discussed in the current literature. This research topic has generated a great deal of interest from the rail industry in Europe...|$|R

5|$|Any {{astatine}} {{present at}} {{the formation of the}} Earth has long since disappeared; the four naturally occurring isotopes (astatine-215, -217, -218 and -219) are instead continuously produced {{as a result of the}} decay of radioactive thorium and uranium ores, <b>and</b> <b>trace</b> quantities of neptunium-237. The landmass of North and South America combined, to a depth of 16 kilometers (10 miles), contains only about one trillion astatine-215 atoms at any given time (around 3.5 × 10−10 grams). Astatine-217 is produced via the radioactive decay of neptunium-237. Primordial remnants of the latter isotope—due to its relatively short half-life of 2.14 million years—are no longer present on Earth. However, trace amounts occur naturally as a product of transmutation reactions in uranium ores. Astatine-218 was the first astatine isotope discovered in nature. Astatine-219, with a half-life of 56 seconds, is the longest lived of the naturally occurring isotopes.|$|E

Aboard the Bus, the aerial headquarters for S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson and his team, Agent Grant Ward is struggling to supervise the training of the unmotivated civilian-recruit Skye. Learning of Hall's kidnapping, Coulson and his team investigate the convoy wreckage.

5|$|Conventional fission {{power plants}} {{rely on the}} chain {{reaction}} caused when fission events release thermal neutrons that cause further fission events. Each fission event in U-235 releases two or three neutrons with about 2MeV of kinetic energy. By careful arrangement {{and the use of}} various absorber materials, designers can balance the system so one of those neutrons causes another fission event while the other one or two are lost. This balance is known as criticality. Natural uranium is a mix of three isotopes; mainly U-238, with some U-235, <b>and</b> <b>trace</b> amounts of U-234. The neutrons released in the fission of either of the main isotopes will cause fission in U-235, but not in U-238, which requires higher energies around 5MeV. There is not enough U-235 in natural uranium to reach criticality. Commercial light water nuclear reactors, the most prevalent power reactors in the world, use nuclear fuel containing uranium enriched to 3 to 5% U-235 while the leftover is U-238.|$|E
5|$|Infants and {{patients}} fed via a gastrostomy tube {{can also be}} given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a prescribed powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed. Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula. Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total cholesterol than a solid ketogenic diet. KetoCal is a nutritionally complete food containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals <b>and</b> <b>trace</b> elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding. Other formula products include KetoVolve and Ketonia. Alternatively, a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose.|$|E
5|$|Vegetables play an {{important}} role in human nutrition. Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling.

When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose is}} to {{identify}} and analyse the effects of using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) enabled vehicle tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing</b> on the operations of organisations involved in an automotive supply chain (SC). A literature study is conducted to set a theoretical framework for SC information sharing, RFID <b>and</b> tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing.</b> A case study of an automotive SC is conducted to fulfill {{the purpose of the}} study. New data and novel possibilities of sharing information through the application of the RFID-based tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing</b> system provide business advantages for all the organizations involved in the studied SC.

40|$|The {{ability for}} {{tracking}} <b>and</b> <b>tracing</b> activities {{has become a}} common feature in supply chains not the least because of quality assurance and product liability considerations. Furthermore, food safety concerns have put tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing</b> at the centre point of discussions {{on the development of}} a competitive and sustainable food production. However, in commodities and especially in food commodities, the establishment of tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing</b> capabilities meets many barriers that have prevented their broad based use beyond what is legally required. Characteristics in the food sector as well as the nature of food commodity products may result in unfavourable cost-benefit considerations at enterprise levels. The view is different at sector and policy levels which creates a complex decision situation. The paper develops a suitable tracking <b>and</b> <b>tracing</b> process <b>and</b> decision model which also supports the understanding of the deadlock the sector is in. The decision situation for enterprises and the sector is summarized in a cost-benefit decision table that provides a framework for future developments.

5|$|When a {{protostar}} {{is formed}} from {{the collapse of}} a giant molecular cloud of gas and dust in the local interstellar medium, the initial composition is homogeneous throughout, consisting of about 70% hydrogen, 28% helium <b>and</b> <b>trace</b> amounts of other elements, by mass. The initial mass of the star depends on the local conditions within the cloud. (The mass distribution of newly formed stars is described empirically by the initial mass function.) During the initial collapse, this pre-main-sequence star generates energy through gravitational contraction. Upon reaching a suitable density, energy generation is begun at the core using an exothermic nuclear fusion process that converts hydrogen into helium.|$|E
5|$|At pH values {{between the}} two pKa values, the {{zwitterion}} predominates, but coexists in dynamic equilibrium with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the exact midpoint {{between the two}} pKa values, the trace amount of net negative <b>and</b> <b>trace</b> of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero. This pH {{is known as the}} isoelectric point pI, so pI = ½(pKa1 + pKa2). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side chains, the pKa of the side chain is involved. Thus for Asp, Glu with negative side chains, pI = ½(pKa1 + pKaR), where pKaR is the side chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pKaR = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the side chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive side chains, pI = ½(pKaR + pKa2). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.|$|E

He indicates several computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house; arsonist Obi Tate, his only known survivor Amanda Young, business man Gus Colyard, gangster Jonas Singer, Laura Hunter, drug dealer Xavier Chavez, prostitute Addison Corday, and Daniel. A nerve agent filling the house will kill them within two hours, but Kramer assures Eric that following his own game, simply sitting and chatting with John, will see his son Daniel returned to him unharmed. At Kerry's urging, Eric agrees in order to buy time for the tech team to arrive <b>and</b> <b>trace</b> the video signal.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} seventeenth century {{relatively}} {{large numbers of}} Scots took service in foreign armies involved in the Thirty Years' War, with 20–30,000 in Swedish service, a Scots brigade in the Netherlands, and 5–6,000 raised for Danish service in the period 1626–27, 11,000 for France and large numbers in the armies of eastern Europe, including German states, Poland and Russia. As armed confrontation between Scotland and the Charles I looked increasingly likely from 1637, the Standing Committee of the Tables began {{to function as a}} war council. It appointed two lairds in every parish to draw up lists of men suitable for military service, arms and the names of Scots serving abroad so that they could be recalled. Three commissioners were appointed in each shire, two residing in Edinburgh and another remaining in the locality, where presbyteries appointed commissioners to communicate instructions to the parishes. Hundreds of Scots mercenaries returned home from foreign service, including experienced leaders like Alexander and David Leslie. These veterans {{played an important role in}} training the parish recruits. Nobles were able to raise regiments, which usually bore their name as colonel, and they could appoint company commanders, but the lieutenant colonel and sergeant major of the regiment, and the lieutenant and sergeant of each company, were to be professional soldiers. The returning soldiers also brought expertise in fortification <b>and</b> <b>trace</b> italliene fortifications were added at Leith, Burntisland and Greenock.

They say he was possessed at age ten by Castiel, demon of mischief, but Castiel needs a new human host every fifty years, and Andras is now dying. Katy was chosen as the next host after a mutual friend at Tabitha and Hector's church recommended her to them. It is revealed that Shell also attends the church, and she helped them to lure Katy.
