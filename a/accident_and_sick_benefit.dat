40|$|The {{macroeconomic}} {{literature on}} automatic stabilization tends {{to focus on}} taxes and dismiss the relevance of government expenditure except for unemployment compensation. Our results go sharply contrary to this view. We engage in an empirical analysis of 21 OECD countries from 1982 to 2003 and find that age- and health-related social expenditure as well as incapacity <b>and</b> <b>sick</b> <b>benefits</b> all react to the cycle in a stabilizing manner. While possibly new in the macro literature, this conforms to many results in studies in labour economics. The policy implications are broad since much previous analysis of discretionary fiscal policy rests on official figures for automatic stabilization. There are also major implications for efforts to incorporate automatic fiscal policy in simulation models". Copyright (c) CEPR, CES, MSH, 2008. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the prevalence and cost of illness of asthma in Germany by retrospectively analysing routine health insurance data. This analysis investigated claims data from all insured persons of six large sickness funds. Insurants with asthma were identified via the International Classification of Diseases (ninth revision) diagnosis and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System Code for regular medication prescriptions. Costs for hospital care, medication <b>and</b> <b>sick</b> <b>benefit</b> were taken from claims data. Costs for rehabilitation, premature death and early retirement were estimated using the human capital approach and data from national statistics. Prevalence of asthma in the German statutory health insurance was 6. 34 %. Total costs for asthma, including direct and indirect costs, were calculated at J 2. 74 billion during 1999. The prevalence of asthma in the German statutory health insurance has previously been estimated to be 4 – 6 %. The results of this large study show the prevalence of asthma in the German social insurance system to be, 6 %. The study also indicates that there is room for substantial savings in the German social insurance system, with indirect costs amounting to 74. 8 % of total costs <b>and</b> payment of <b>sick</b> <b>benefits</b> through the sickness funds amounting to 58. 3 % of indirect costs.

40|$|Studies on shading {{behaviour}} of contractors have in {{the past}} been focused on lack of product quality and other factors affecting the customer. This study of 222 publicly procured road and railroad projects aim to analyse shading behaviour from a perspective of workers safety. The study shows, though with limitations in statistical power, that the number of reported incidents related to workers’ safety increases in projects with high numbers of bidders, i. e. projects under high competitive pressure, further the number of days of registered sick leave also increases with higher numbers of bidders. However, measures directly related to contractors shading behaviour do seem to increase prediction of number of <b>accidents</b> <b>and</b> <b>sick</b> leave days. It is suggested that public authority has to construct bid competitions in manners which does not necessarily aim at the best bargain but rather have a fair bargain approach balancing the goals of the contractor and the goals of the public client. This can be done by balancing the allocation of risks more evenly among the parties ex ante...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the implementation of the waiting period into the sickness insurance in the Czech Republic in the years from 2008 to 2014. The theoretical part explains the fundamental concepts related to the sickness insurance, the health insurance allowance and the waiting period. The practical part consists of a legal analysis and the current happening around the waiting period in the Czech Republic or in the EU and EFTA member states. The income and expenditure analysis of the sickness insurance helps to reveal that the costs of sickness insurance have decreased, which was also due to the implementation of the waiting period. This work evaluates data, which indicate that the short-term morbidity has decreased as well as the work incapacity. There are detailed calculations in the conclusion which show how adjustments in the sickness insurance changed the amount of wage compensation <b>and</b> the <b>sick</b> <b>benefits.</b> The aim of this work is to identify and quantify the benefits and costs of the waiting period implementation within the sickness insurance in the Czech Republic...|$|R

40|$|The Freedom Benevolent Society was {{a mutual}} aid and fraternal {{organization}} founded by Jewish {{immigrants from the}} Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1882, on the Lower East Side of New York City. The collection documents the society's activities over more than a century, from 1884 until its initiation of dissolution proceedings, in 1991. It includes membership applications from {{the early decades of}} the society's history (1884 - 1927), anniversary programs spanning fifty years (1932 - 1982), and a visitors' register for the 1500 th meeting, in 1950, as well as account books, meeting notices, and two cemetery plans, one of which relates to the First Franz Joseph Ladies <b>Sick</b> <b>and</b> Benevolent Society. The Freedom Benevolent Society was a mutual aid and fraternal organization founded by Jewish immigrants in the fall of 1882, in the Golden Rule Hall, at Rivington and Essex Streets, on the Lower East Side of New York City. Its main purpose was to provide its members with <b>sick</b> <b>benefits,</b> <b>and</b> relief in times of need, as well as fellowship and entertainment. Eventually it also functioned as a burial society, and maintained cemetery plots. The society received a charter from the State of New York in December 1882 and was incorporated in May 1883. The early members presumably hailed from the Austro-Hungarian Empire (Austria-Hungary), since the original name of the organization makes reference to the emperor: Erster Kaiser Franz Josef Kranken Unterstützungs-Verein, or the First Franz Joseph <b>Sick</b> <b>and</b> Benevolent Society. According to the brief histories published in the society's anniversary programs, there were 14 founding members: Dr. Bleier, Louis Fishel, Louis Fleigel, Louis Fried, Mr. Fuchs (the first president), M. Heidenreich, William Klein, Johann Krauss, Max London, Mr. Luft, Dr. Price, Mr. Reich, Mr. Rottenberg, and Adolph Schroeder. Early in its history the society held meetings and kept records in the German language. It officially changed its name to the Freedom Benevolent Society on March 27, 1940, and by that time was apparently conducting its business exclusively in English. At its 50 th anniversary, in 1932, at what was probably the peak of its size, the society had close to 300 members. At the 70 th anniversary, in 1952, approximately 120 members had attended a meeting in the past year; and at the centennial, in 1982, there were approximately 75 members. Meetings were held in public venues such as hotels. The society had only male members. For at least a time, in the 1930 s to 1940 s, there was a women's auxiliary, the Franz Joseph Ladies <b>Sick</b> <b>and</b> Benevolent Society. For most of its history the society had a Relief Committee; a <b>Sick</b> Committee; <b>and</b> a Shiva Committee, or, later on, a Cemetery Board. Until around 1950 it had its own physician. The Relief Committee received no requests for aid after 1970; <b>and</b> the <b>Sick</b> Committee was dissolved, <b>and</b> <b>sick</b> <b>benefits</b> eliminated, in 1974. The society began liquidation proceedings in December 1991, and the proceedings were finally closed in 2013. Processeddigitize...|$|R
