40|$|Alkylsulfate-based ionic liquids (ILs) were {{synthesized}} {{and used}} as solid-liquid separation solvents to extract asphaltene-type materials from direct coal liquefaction residue (DCLR). Among the ILs employed, tetraethylammonium ethylsulfate ([E 4 N][ESO 4]) was {{proved to be a}} potential solvent for trapping asphaltene-type materials from DCLR due to the higher extraction yield and the lower H/C atomic ratio of the extract. N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) was added to reduce the viscosity of [E 4 N][ESO 4]. It also increased the extraction yield and decreased H/C atomic ratio of the asphaltene-type materials. The mechanism of extraction might be concluded that the interactions are formed between ILs or [E 4 N][ESO 4]/NMP mixed solvents and asphaltene-type materials, which disturbs the interactions between DCLR and leads to the dissolution of asphaltene-type materials into solvents.

Three Clar structures with two sextets each are present in chrysene.

The extracts were characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, C- 13 -NMR, quinoline insolubles tests and so on. The results show that asphaltenes with the potential of precursors of carbon materials can be separated from DCLR at room temperature using PILs and the solid-liquid separation is carried out facilely due to the lower viscosities of PILs. The influences of PILs structures on extraction yields and atomic ratios of H/C were also investigated. As alkyl chain length of PILs anions increases, extraction yields of asphaltenes increase while H/C ratios decrease. Moreover, extraction yields vary with various cations of PILs and increase according {{to the order of}} N-methylimidazolium ([MIM](+)) triethylammonium ([TEtA](+)) > 3 -methylpyridinium ([MPy](+)).

Soil samples (0 - 5 cm) were collected every 12 months for 5 years from two sites that had contrasting soil types and fertility. Harvest residue management treatments established at both sites were (a) no harvest residues; and (b) double harvest residues. The use of 13 C CPMAS and DD NMR spectroscopy enabled the successful non-destructive detection of SOM quality changes in the two E. globulus plantations. Relative intensities of 13 C CPMAS NMR spectral regions were similar at both sites, and for both harvest residue treatments, indicating that SOM composition was also similar. Dipolar dephasing (DD) NMR spectra revealed resonances in SOM assigned to lignin and tannin structures, with larger resonances in the carbonyl and alkyl C regions that were indicative of cuticular material, enabling detection of changes in SOM quality.

Suwannee River NOM, Suwannee River fulvic acid, and Pahokee Peat fulvic acid were treated with 15 N-labeled nitric acid at concentrations ranging from 15 % to 22 % and analyzed by liquid and solid state 15 N NMR spectroscopy. Bulk Pahokee peat and Illinois # 6 coal were also treated with nitric acid, at 29 % and 40 % respectively, and analyzed by solid state 15 N NMR spectroscopy. In addition to nitro groups from nitration of aromatic carbon, the 15 N NMR spectra of all five samples exhibited peaks attributable to nitrosation reactions. These include nitrosophenol peaks in the peat fulvic acid and Suwannee River samples, from nitrosation of phenolic rings, and N-nitroso groups in the peat samples, from nitrosation of secondary amides or amines, the latter consistent with the peat samples having the highest naturally abundant nitrogen contents. Peaks attributable to Beckmann and secondary reactions of the initially formed oximes were present in all spectra, including primary amide, secondary amide, lactam, and nitrile nitrogens. The degree of secondary reaction product formation resulting from nitrosation reactions appeared to correlate inversely with the 13 C <b>aromaticities</b> of the samples.
