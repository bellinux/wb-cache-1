It is possible to predict the hardening, the thinning and required forces for sheet metal stamped parts {{and it is also}} possible to predict the geometrical defects such as springback, wrinkling and surface <b>appearance</b> problems. <b>Sheet</b> metal forming can therefore be used in a closed loop to help design of parts and required tools in order to achieve a pre-defined geometry and mechanical performance. The paper presents a practical optimization methodology applied to automotive sheet metal stamped parts. The goal is to automatically optimize tool geometry in order to achieve an optimal part. An optimal part is regarded as a part free of defects. The defects are classified in two categories: material and geometrical. Material defects prevent the forming of the parts which can be {{in the form of a}} premature failure or an excessive wrinkling. The geometrical defects prevent the formed part from being assembled to the body structure and are generally referred as “springback”.

In yeast, altering lipid synthesis by inactivating the yeast homolog of lipin, a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase, leads to disorganization of the peripheral ER and abnormal nuclear shape.

In mammals, lipin has been implicated in adipose tissue differentiation, insulin resistance, lipid storage and obesity, but the underlying cellular defects caused by altering lipin levels are not known.

To isolate the influence of formation from other factors which differ between species and fractions and may cause strength differences, we compared one fraction of one species at differing forming consistencies. This showed that the direct contribution of formation to tensile strength was significant, with poor formation giving lower strength for all fractions.

Functional (electroretinogram), chemical (rhodopsin analyses) and morphological (light and electron microscopy) data obtained in the rat indicated two main processes: (a) overproduction of rhodopsin and an associated abnormal lamellar tissue component, (b) progressive loss of photoreceptor cells. The first abnormality recognized was the <b>appearance</b> of swirling <b>sheets</b> or bundles of extracellular lamellae between normally developing retinal rods and pigment epithelium; membrane thickness and spacing resembled that in normal outer segments.

Photoreceptors attained virtually adult form and ERG function. Then rod inner segments and nuclei began degenerating; the ERG lost sensitivity and showed selective depression of the a-wave at high luminances. Outer segments and lamellae gradually degenerated and rhodopsin content decreased. No phagocytosis was seen, though pigment cells partially dedifferentiated and many migrated through the outer segment-debris zone toward the retina.

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{detailed}} investigation concerning the construction of granite plutons by the incremental emplacement of granitic sheets. The modem consensus is that sheeted plutons are often controlled by tectonic structures such shear zones. The Main Donegal Granite (MDG), NW Ireland forms the basis to this study. This pluton is the largest presently exposed member of the Caledonian Donegal Batholith (~ 405 Ma). Field evidence from this highly deformed pluton, attest to emplacement along the long-axis of a sinistral transcurrent shear zone. The presence of long and persistent xenolith "trains" within the pluton has been taken as evidence of an overall sheeted structure; however detailed maps have not been available to test this hypothesis. Two earlier members of the Donegal Batholith, the Ardara and Thorr plutons, whilst having their main outcrops outside the MDG, also occur as xenoliths within the main body. It can be demonstrated {{in a number of}} critical situations that these xenoliths are commonly more deformed than the host MDG facies. Furthermore the presence of original country rock contacts implies these xenoliths were originally in situ. These features imply that the shear zone was active prior to the emplacement of the MDG, with it controlling the emplacement of substantial parts of these earlier plutons. Further evidence from the study of parts of the petrographically similar and younger Trawenagh Bay Granite implies the sinistral shear zone was still operational after the majority of the MDG had crystallised. New, detailed (scale 1 : 250) and reconnaissance mapping of the MDG, reveals its hitherto unrecognised heterogeneity. At least seven major plutonic zones or packages have been identified. All these units have an NE -SW elongate form parallel to the long axis of the pluton and are often, but not always, separated by extensive "raft-trains" of country rock and older plutons. The major packages in the central regions of the pluton are often complex and are composed of three main granitoid phases, ranging in composition form early granodiorites and tonalites to latest porphyritic and to lesser extent equigranular, monzogranites. The early granodiorite and tonalite sheets are now only preserved as xenolithic rafts within the later monzogranites. The broad range in composition/chemistry together allied with field observations implies a complex intrusion history, with these granitoid packages representing sites of long-standing intrusion within the pluton. In contrast, towards the more marginal areas of the pluton there are large units of monzogranite which are characterised by general homogeneity, but in reality are believed to consist of relatively small compostionally similar sheets. On all scales, either meta-sediments, older plutonic material, or early MDG facies are found to lie along the boundaries of younger intrusive units. This implies the pluton is primarily sheeted in character and that the "raft-trains" are partially disrupted, in situ roof material which has been wedged apart during the intrusion of the <b>sheets.</b> The <b>appearance</b> of <b>sheets</b> within the field is dependent on the rheology of the material into which the granitic material was intruded into, i. e. to what extent has the host was crystallised. The degree of crystallisation in the host is related to how fast later sheets were being intruded, i. e. the rate of emplacement. The field relationships, in the central regions of the pluton, between the granodiorites tonalites and the later monzogranites, are interpreted as representing zones of episodic-to slow emplacement, where earlier phases had become essentially competent by the time later units were intruded (i. e. capable of fracture). These earlier phases may be preserved as angular rafts within later sheets. At moderate emplacement rates earlier sheets may still be crystallising but sufficiently viscous to prevent mixing, except at their immediate boundaries with transitional contacts developing. The more homogeneous zones are believed to be related to rapid emplacement with original contacts between pulses being destroyed at the level of emplacement due to homogenisation of pulses which had similar viscosities and hence allowed mixing. The emplacement of granitic melts within active shear zones can lead {{to the development of a}} self- perpetuating situation, where melts in a shear zone will enhance deformation rates and cause greater displacements subsequently allowing more melt to enter the shear zone promoting even greater displacement rates. This process is only halted when melts within the source regions are drained; hence the rate of pluton construction and <b>appearance</b> of <b>sheets</b> within plutons is ultimately related to how fast granitic melts are being generated within the source regions...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} the horseshoe drag exerted on a low-mass planet {{embedded in a}} gaseous disk, assuming the disk’s flow in the coorbital region to be adiabatic. We restrict this analysis {{to the case of}} a planet on a circular orbit, and we assume a steady flow in the corotating frame. We also assume that the corotational flow upstream of the U-turns is unperturbed, so that we discard saturation effects. In addition to the classical expression for the horseshoe drag in barotropic disks, which features the vortensity gradient across corotation, we find an additional term which scales with the entropy gradient, and whose amplitude depends on the perturbed pressure at the stagnation point of the horseshoe separatrices. This additional torque is exerted by evanescent waves launched at the horseshoe separatrices, as a consequence of an asymmetry of the horseshoe region. It has a steep dependence on the potential’s softening length, suggesting that the effect can be extremely strong in the three dimensional case. We describe the main properties of the coorbital region (the production of vortensity during the U-turns, the <b>appearance</b> of vorticity <b>sheets</b> at the downstream separatrices, and the pressure response), and we give torque expressions suitable to this regime of migration.

40|$|Possibilities to {{influence}} the deep drawing process during its duration are limited and generally consist of influences at the flange of the thin sheet, mainly by the contact pressure (the blank holding force). The common characteristics of previous investigations were setting of the fixed values of the blank holding force or the holder's pressure within the ironing tool. The objective {{of this investigation was}} the continuous setting of the variable pressure during the sliding process, via the preset functions, in order to analyze the variable pressure influence on the ironing process. This is why an experimental computerized device was designed and constructed for analyzing the influence of the variable contact pressure on the sliding process of the model strip during the flat-die test. The multi-parameter experiment was conducted; various materials of the tested pieces were applied (primarily thin sheet made of Al alloys and low-carbon steels sheet, with and without coating); different versions of the tool's contact elements were used, with various friction regimes and influential parameters (variable contact pressure during the sliding process, etc.). This experimental device practically represents a simulator for realization and studying of the physical model of an important segment of the ironing process in the completely realistic conditions (materials, tools, etc.). The aim was to find the optimal combination of the variable contact pressure and the tribological parameters, so that the punch force, as one of the process output parameters, would have the minimal value, as well as to avoid the undesired effects during the forming (difficult sliding of the flange, <b>appearance</b> of thin <b>sheet's</b> wrinkling, structural destruction, etc.).

40|$|AbstractHot rolled, {{annealed}} or galvanized {{low carbon}} steel sheets display yield points in tensile testing. These are associated with deformation heterogeneities along the test specimen, known as Lüders bands, which cause an unacceptable surface <b>appearance</b> in steel <b>sheet</b> formed products. This problem is usually eliminated through a light cold rolling pass (“skin-pass”) in the material as a last step in its industrial manufacturing, imposing a reduction of thickness of about 1 – 2. 0 % on the sheet. Existing experimental results for these strain heterogeneities along the rolling direction are analyzed, as well as corresponding finite element analyses. The constitutive behavior of the material is described by a curve displaying an initial stress peak followed by the work hardening of the material. The FEAs led to distributions and shapes of Lüders bands in the sheets similar to the experimental ones. The bands nucleate intermitently and propagate {{from the surface of}} the sheets, at the initial contact region between the material and the rolls. For low and high friction between the material and the roll and for low sheet thickness reductions (0. 5 % and 1. 0 %), a limited influence of the roll diameter on the Lüders bands distribution was found. For sheet thickness reductions of 2. 0 % and higher, high friction between the roll and the material and large roll diameters, the distribution of LBs in the sheets was different from that obtained for small roll diameters and low friction between the rolls and the material. Increasing thickness reductions in the skin-pass led to changes in the Lüders bands distribution, involving an increasing homogeneity in the deformation. It is suggested that the critical thickness reduction in the skin-pass is associated to a minimum volume fraction of material deformed above a certain strain level...|$|R
40|$|Eolian ergs, and {{associated}} environs {{are sensitive to}} short- and long-term climate changes. In one of the oldest, erg deposits, the ~ 2. 0 Ga Makgabeng Formation, facies association changes reflect {{one of the earliest}} recordings of short-term climatic shifts in a continental setting. The Makgabeng Formation is separated into lower and upper erg deposits by a playa or saline pan deposit. The lower erg deposit consists of dune sets with thin lenses of dry and deflationary interdunes that transitions vertically to thicker damp to wet interdunes. A laterally persistent playa deposit {{in the middle of the}} section consists of mudstone with deep and shallow penetrating mud cracks and subordinate siltstone and sandstone interbeds. Above this lower mudstone interval, the playa strata are sandy. Overlying the playa deposit, the upper erg deposit consists of thick eolian sets with thin lenses of dry interdune deposits. Grain size change near the top of the upper erg deposit corresponds to the <b>appearance</b> of fluvial, <b>sheet</b> flood, eolian cross-beds sculpted by mass flows, and thin playa deposits. The vertical facies association demonstrates shifts in precipitation and fluctuating water tables. Fluvial and playa deposits record high water tables whereas low-water tables are reflected in the core erg. The transition from a lower to higher water table is recorded by wet interdune interspersed within the dune strata towards the top of this interval. Rapid climatic amelioration occurred near the termination of the Makgabeng erg resulting in impingement of ephemeral river systems, development of playas, and generation of massive sand flows. This 2. 0 Ga erg demonstrates the impact of climate change on erg development, resulting from shifts in the monsoonal impingement through time.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the real time records of aurora by use of a highly {{sensitive}} TV camera at Syowa Station, Antarctica, classifications of appearance modes, patterns, and dynamics of auroras are attempted. The modes of appearance are classified into continuous appearance and intermittent <b>appearance,</b> patterns into <b>sheet</b> (or discrete arc), diffuse arc, smoke, striation, patch, and surface, and basic dynamics into splitting (or fold-over), fractional rotation, disruption and reconnection, meandering and folding, drift and propagation, on-off switching (or pulsation), and fading out. Among the 7 dynamical features, the splittings and rotations associated with rapid disruption and reconnections are found to be the most essential ones as the auroral activity proceeds, which leads to both the poleward and westward expansion of dusk aurora and the equatorward and eastward expansion of dawn aurora during an expansion phase. Rotation and folding-over of bright parts of aurora are concluded to be always clockwise viewed from below (viewed along the magnetic field). For example, splittings arise toward the right-hand side (clockwise curving protrusion from the primary sheet), bright spots rotate clockwise with trailing arms, active bright spots rotate with outward and clockwise streaming arms and small splittings such as ray structures unfold through a clockwise rotation of the split part. Rotation dominates in the region of a westward traveling surge or auroral bulge and poleward expanding arc, and consequently these regions are characterized by a chain of a strong clockwise vorticity or strong shear of drift, suggesting a rapid production of radial electric field in the magnetic tube of flux corresponding to these regions. It is pointed out that the clockwise splitting is the initial activation of aurora, and that the split part subsequently expands into a loop or a typical S-type structure as the luminosity increases at the expanding front. On the other hand, another typical pattern, the flame-like pattern, tends to appear mostly at the contracting or shrinking site of auroral activity also as a result of multiple clock-wise splittings. It can appear also even at the expanding front when the expansion slows down or stops as well when the expanding front begins to retreat. An S-type pattern is found to be the most fundamental pattern of discrete aurora at the western part of an activated region, while a flame-like structure is that mostly at the eastern part. The two patterns, despite the apparent difference, are concluded to arise from the same deformation processes, of which the S-pattern formation is an expanding mode and the flame-pattern formation is a less active or shrinking mode. As a matter of fact, rotational symmetry is found between the cusp-like S-pattern formation and flame-pattern formation. Special emphasis is placed on the striking similarity between the global and local patterns, namely {{on the fact that the}} two patterns, the S-pattern and the flame-pattern, are the same independent of the sizes of the patterns from global to local. These essentially have the same development modes, suggesting that the physical processes giving rise to these structures are due to the general dynamics of electron plasma sheet or cloud in a magnetic field without any specific requirements on the configuration and distribution of magnetic field and plasma and that the dynamics is ruled by a simple similarity law which permits a formulations of the dynamics in a dimensionless formula with some appropriate similarity constants. Inter-relations between auroral activities and VLF-ULF emissions, are briefly reviewed as well...|$|R
