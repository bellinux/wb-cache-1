30|$|Compared to the {{tertiary}} mode, {{the secondary}} mode resulted in higher breakthrough recovery but lower ultimate oil recovery. This is maybe {{due to the}} fact that in the secondary mode, the surfactant should improve the macroscopic sweep efficiency (volumetric sweep of the <b>injection</b> <b>fluid</b> and capture of the displaced oil at the core sample outlet) rather than the microscopic sweep efficiency (displacement efficiency of the <b>injection</b> <b>fluid</b> in the rock volume that is swept), whereas in the tertiary mode, the microscopic sweep efficiency is what matters mainly.|$|R

30|$|Use of the {{polymeric}} waterflood is {{a technique}} to enhance oil recovery from a reservoir by improving the reservoir sweep and {{reducing the amount of}} <b>injection</b> <b>fluid</b> needed to produce the same amount of oil (Sorbie and Phil 1991). Polymer floods work by adding a certain amount of water-soluble polymers to the <b>injection</b> <b>fluid</b> to increase the viscosity of the injectant (Chang et al. 2006). In this way, the mobility ratio between the displaced phase and displacing phase can be reduced significantly, and the sweep volume is increased accordingly.|$|R
30|$|The {{chemical}} EOR {{methods are}} those that add chemical agents to the <b>injection</b> <b>fluid</b> (e.g., surfactant, polymer, foam flooding, and nano) or tune the composition of injection brine (low salinity and smart water injection) to change the rock and fluid properties towards favorable conditions. In the polymer injection, a water-soluble polymer {{is added to the}} water, such that the viscosity of water increased, and hence, the mobility ratio is improved (Needham and Doe 1987). The surfactants’ flooding changes the interfacial tension between oil and <b>injection</b> <b>fluid,</b> such that the capillary forces decrease and the trapped oil is release from the tight pores (Green and Willhite 1998 a). The Nano EOR as a recent approach is performed by dispersing a nano particle (e.g., silica) in the <b>injection</b> <b>fluid</b> to change the rock–fluid surface properties (wettability or IFT). One of the main challenges in Nano EOR is stability of nanoparticles in the carrier fluid (brine) which may affect the performance of this method (Karimi et al. 2012).|$|R

30|$|Usually, the {{injection}} evaluation of chemical flooding is {{conducted by the}} variation of dynamic injection data such as the rise of {{the injection}} pressure and the drop of the injection rate. The increase in the flow resistance to the <b>injection</b> <b>fluid</b> indicates the increment of the chemical efficiency. After the chemical solution is injected into a reservoir, due to the high-molecular weight polymer dissolved in the <b>injection</b> <b>fluid,</b> the flow resistance increases, causing an increase in the injection pressure and a decline in the injection rate (Cheng et al. 2002; Li 2004). As a result, the variation of the injection pressure and the injection rate can be used to evaluate whether the chemical injection is effective.|$|R

This study aimed to compare the most commonly used vascular injection products in fresh-frozen and formalin-embalmed cadaver specimens. An overview of the properties, advantages and limitations of each substance was given, and a comparison of vascular infusion procedures in both preservation methods was made. A literature search was performed in order to identify the most commonly used vascular injection products. Acrylic paint, latex, gelatin, silicone, Araldite F and Batson's No. 17 were selected for the study. One fresh-frozen and one embalmed cadaver forearm were infused with each injection product according to a uniform protocol. The curing time, skin- and subcutaneous tissue penetration, degree of filling of the arterial tree, extravasations, consistency of the injected vessels during dissection, and the costs of each <b>injection</b> <b>fluid</b> were noted. There was a large variation between the <b>injection</b> <b>fluids</b> in processing- and curing time, colour intensity, flexibility, fragility, elasticity, strength, toxicity and costs. All fluids were suitable for infusion. The penetration of <b>injection</b> <b>fluid</b> into the skin and subcutaneous tissue was significantly better in fresh-frozen specimens (P = 0. 002 and P = 0. 009, respectively), with significantly smaller branches casted (P = 0. 004). Vascular infusion of fresh-frozen cadaver specimens results in a significantly better filled coloured arterial tree, enabling more detail to be achieved and smaller branches casted. The biomechanical properties of fresh-frozen soft tissues are less affected compared with formalin fixation.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{two approaches}} for estimating formation permeability based on microseismic data. The two approaches differ {{in terms of}} the mechanism that triggers the seismicity: pore-pressure triggering mechanism and the so-called seepage-force (or effective stress) triggering mechanism. Based on microseismic data from a hydraulic fracture experiment using water and supercritical CO 2 injection, we estimate permeability using the two different approaches. The microseismic data comes from two hydraulic stimulation treatments that were performed on two formation intervals having similar geological, geomechanical, and in situ stress conditions, yet different <b>injection</b> <b>fluid</b> was used. Both approaches (pore-pressure triggering, and the seepage-force triggering) provide estimates of permeability within the same order of magnitude.

The work contains theoretical review of the materials connected to the topic, experimental part, interpretation of acquired data, discussion of results, simulation and proposed mechanism. In this thesis the effect of changing the injection water salinity on oil recovery was studied. The porous media {{is represented by the}} Stevns Klint chalk cores. Synthetic oil that was used is the mixture of n-decane and stearic acid. Synthetic sea water was acquired by diluting salts in distilled water (total salinity is 33388 ppm). Low salinity brines represent the dilution of synthetic sea water 5 times, 10 times, 15 times, 20 times and 25 times. Synthetic sea water and low salinity brines were studied during primary recovery water flooding on 4 PV/day flowrate and 16 PV/day flowrate. The recovery using different salinity gave different results both on low flowrate and on high flowrate. The data acquired during the flooding process, including pressure drop, pH of the effluent and the <b>injection</b> <b>fluid,</b> ions chromatography analysis, were interpreted and support the discussion about the observed recovery results. Based on these data the mechanism of the recovery increase with low salinity is proposed. It includes the brine/rock interaction which induces the dissolution of calcite. The dissolution leads to peeling off calcite particles and fine migration in core. Fines then block the pore throats and this increases the sweep efficiency. The proposed reason for the difference in dissolution rates between different salinity brines lies in physical properties of these brines, such as pH of <b>injection</b> <b>fluid</b> and IFT. The pH of brine decreases with lowering of salinity, which enhance the dissolution process. However, IFT between the <b>injection</b> <b>fluid</b> and synthetic oil increases with lowering of salinity, which increases the amount of capillary trapped oil. These two parameters working together can give the distribution of results as it was observed. The simulation of relative permeability curves in Sendra supports the proposed mechanism. The implementing of 10 times diluted synthetic sea water as a secondary recovery fluid brought incremental oil. This shows the potential of implementing low salinity brine as an EOR fluid. However, the incremental oil is only equal to 0. 3 % OOIC. This was connected to the damaging of the core by synthetic sea water on high flowrate during primary flooding...|$|R

30|$|The {{variation}} of the RPI can be interpreted by the {{variation of}} resistance to flow in the reservoir.
