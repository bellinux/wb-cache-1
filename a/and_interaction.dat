Despite predictions of weakening, the typhoon continued to intensify, reaching peak winds of 175km/h (110mph 10minute sustained) on March5. The combination of cooler air <b>and</b> <b>interaction</b> with the westerlies caused Mitag to weaken significantly. Only four days after reaching peak winds, the storm had dissipated well to the east of the Philippines.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{unsupervised}} learning framework for activity perception. To understand activities in complicated scenes from visual data, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian model to connect three elements: low-level visual features, simple “atomic ” activities, <b>and</b> multi-agent <b>interactions.</b> Atomic activities are modeled as distributions over low-level visual features, <b>and</b> <b>interactions</b> are modeled as distributions over atomic activities. Our models improve existing language models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) by modeling interactions without supervision. Our data sets are challenging video sequences from crowded traffic scenes with {{many kinds of}} activities co-occurring. Our approach provides a summary of typical atomic activities <b>and</b> <b>interactions</b> in the scene. Unusual activities <b>and</b> <b>interactions</b> are found, with natural probabilistic explanations. Our method supports flexible high-level queries on activities <b>and</b> <b>interactions</b> using atomic activities as components. 1...|$|R
5|$|The {{combat system}} is turn-based instead of real-time. Gameplay is usually step-based, where player actions are {{performed}} serially {{and take a}} variable measure of in-game time to complete. Game processes (e.g., monster movement <b>and</b> <b>interaction,</b> progressive effects such as poisoning or starvation) advance based on {{the passage of time}} dictated by these actions. This requires the player to learn and apply tactics as they progress in the dungeon.|$|E

The first levels focus on restoring life and color to the landscape. After activating a series of windmills, the player flies through a nighttime field, illuminating darkened strings of lights until they reach the city. The city is full of menacing metal structures, small arcs of electricity, and washed-out buildings; the player enlivens the city in the final two levels and transforms it into a bright and cheerful place.|$|E

5|$|Later on January2, the {{combination}} of the subtropical ridge to the north, an approaching mid-latitude trough and moderate to strong westerlies caused Severe Tropical Storm Cyprien to turn towards the southwest. Slight weakening took place shortly before the storm made landfall in Morombe; maximum winds decreased to 50mph (85km/h 10-minute winds). Increased wind shear <b>and</b> <b>interaction</b> with land caused the deep convection to become substantially displaced to the east from the center of circulation. Early on January3, Cyprien was downgraded to a tropical depression by both agencies; however, some areas were still reporting gale-force winds. It turned to the northeast over land, dissipating late on January3.|$|E

In 2006, Levy-Pounds founded the Community Justice Project (CJP), a partnership between UST's School of Law and the Saint Paul chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

5|$|Mass Effect is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video game developed by BioWare {{and published by}} Microsoft Game Studios and Electronic Arts. Originally released for the Xbox 360 video game console in 2007, {{it is the first}} game of the Mass Effect series. The game takes place within the Milky Way galaxy in the year 2183, where civilization is threatened by a highly advanced machine race of synthetic-organic starships. The player assumes the role of Commander Shepard, an elite human soldier who must stop a rogue agent from carrying out the machine race's galactic invasion. The gameplay requires the player to complete multiple quests that generally involve space exploration, squad and vehicular combat, <b>and</b> <b>interaction</b> with non-player characters.|$|E

Poorer outcomes were related to {{lack of access to}} appropriate AAC supports and resources, problems with technology and negative attitudes.|$|E
5|$|Sociology is the {{scientific}} study of society, including patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and culture. It is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order, acceptance, and change. Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the micro-sociology level of individual agency <b>and</b> <b>interaction</b> to the macro level of systems and the social structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of 4 consists of mid-tempo pieces, {{but unlike the}} filler that might have occupied this pacing on previous albums, many of this album’s greatest strengths lie in this realm. Perhaps best exemplifying this spirit is the André 3000 and Kanye West assisted, 'Party' in which Beyoncé relaxes into a beat that, while {{not be easy to}} grind to, still works perfectly as a party anthem. Beyoncé reminds us that a party is not only meant for dancing. It is a place where you go to enjoy the company of others and oftentimes, that involves real human conversation <b>and</b> <b>interaction.</b> Echoing this sentiment, André’s verse is tranquilized from his customarily rapid-fire delivery to a drawl more reminiscent of Lil’ Wayne than his traditional work with Outkast. 'Party' like much of 4, is a conversation, and André 3000 wants to be heard.|$|E
