40|$|Much of the self-image of the Western {{university}} {{hangs on}} the idea that research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> are intimately connected. The central axiom here is that research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> are mutually supportive of each other. An institution lacking such a set of relationships between research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> falls short {{of what it means to}} be a university. This set of beliefs raises certain questions: Is it the case that the presence of such a mutually supportive set of relationships between research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> is a necessary condition of the fulfilment of the idea of the university? (A conceptual question). And is it true that, in practice today, such a mutually supportive set of relationships between research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> characterises universities? (An empirical question). In my talk, I want to explore these matters in a critical vein. I shall suggest that: a) In practice today, such a mutually supportive set of relationships between research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> is in jeopardy. Far from supporting each other, very often research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> contend against each other. Research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> are becoming two separate ideologies, with their own interest structures. b) Historically, the supposed tight link between research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> is both of recent origin and far from universally achieved in universities. Institutional separateness between research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> is <b>and</b> has been evident, both across institutions and even across departments in the same institution. c) Conceptually, research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> are different activities: each is complex and neither is reducible to the other. In theory, therefore, research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> may be said to constitute a holy alliance but in practice, we see more of an unholy alliance. If, then, in an ideal world, a positive relationship between research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> is still a worthwhile goal, how might it be construed and worked for? Seeing research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> as two discrete and unified sets of activity is now inadequate. Much better is a construal of research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> as themselves complexes, as intermingling pools of activity helping to form the liquid university that is emerging today. On this view, research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> are fluid spaces, ever on the move, taking up new shapes, and themselves dividing and reforming, as the university reworks its own destiny in modern society. On such a perspective, working out a productive relationship between research <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> is a complex project. This is an alliance that is neither holy nor unholy. It is an uneasy alliance, with temporary accommodations and continuous new possibilitie...|$|R

After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane to depressurize. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Flynn and Troy take the controls of the plane and Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game flight simulator. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, the plane makes it to the terminal. The passengers leave the plane and anti-venom is given to those who need it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest.
