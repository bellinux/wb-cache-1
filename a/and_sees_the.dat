5|$|Many astronomical {{alignments}} {{have been}} claimed for Stonehenge, {{a complex of}} megaliths and earthworks in the Salisbury Plain of England. The most famous {{of these is the}} midsummer alignment, where the Sun rises over the Heel Stone. However, this interpretation has been challenged by some archaeologists who argue that the midwinter alignment, where the viewer is outside Stonehenge <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> sun setting in the henge, is the more significant alignment, and the midsummer alignment may be a coincidence due to local topography.|$|E

5|$|Arha's {{childhood}} and youth are lonely; her only friends are Manan and Penthe, a priestess her own age. She {{is trained in}} her duties by Thar and Kossil, the priestesses of the two other major deities. Thar tells her of the undertomb and the labyrinth beneath the Tombs, teaching her the instructions to find her way around them. She tells of the treasure hidden within the labyrinth, which wizards from the archipelago have tried to steal in past years. When Arha asks about the wizards, Thar tells her that they are unbelievers who can work magic. When she turns fourteen, Arha assumes all the responsibilities of her position, becoming the highest ranked priestess in the Tombs. She is required to order the death of prisoners sent to the Tombs by the God-King of the Kargad lands; she has them killed by starvation, an act which haunts {{her for a long}} time. After Thar dies of old age, Arha becomes increasingly isolated: although stern, Thar had been fair to her. Kossil despises Arha <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> Nameless Ones as a threat to her power.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Seward {{comes to}} respect and {{collaborate}} with Lincoln. Chase, on the other hand, schemes against Lincoln from within the cabinet, hoping to replace him as the Republican nominee in the 1864 presidential election. Lincoln nonetheless keeps Chase in the cabinet until 1864 for his skill at financing the war effort, and his efforts to undermine the president are ultimately unsuccessful. Lincoln also recruits Chase ally Edwin M. Stanton to replace Pennsylvania political boss Simon Cameron as Secretary of War; like Seward, Stanton comes {{to respect and}} support Lincoln. While managing the disparate personalities of his cabinet, Lincoln also struggles to manage a series of generals including George B. McClellan, Henry Halleck, and George Meade. The president finally finds success in 1864 by promoting Ulysses S. Grant to commander of the Union armies. Lincoln oversees {{the passage of the}} Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolishes slavery, <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> war to its successful conclusion. He also appoints Chase as the Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, believing him the best man to secure the rights of newly freed black citizens.|$|E

5|$|Following her {{resignation}} from Vector in {{the wake}} of her discoveries and the Gnosis Terrorism, Shion allies with underground group Scientia to investigate. Her former co-worker Allen takes her place looking after KOS-MOS. Meanwhile, Canaan, Jr., Jin, chaos, MOMO and Ziggy are investigating a landmass that originated from Lost Jerusalem. They are attacked by Margulis, then the landmass is swallowed with the Elsa in an inverted pocket of hyperspace. Shion meanwhile visits Allen, <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> demonstration of two new weapons for fighting the Gnosis—T-elos, a battle robot meant to replace KOS-MOS; and Omega, a mech created from the Proto Omega's remains and piloted by Abel. After the test, T-elos' creator Roth Mantel informs Allen that KOS-MOS will be scrapped so development can focus on T-elos. As KOS-MOS's weaponry {{is the only way to}} break into the hyperspace pocket and save the Elsa, Shion leads the group into the facility and rescues KOS-MOS, guided at one point by Abel. During this time, Shion has frequent visions of the girl Nephilim, and has blackouts where she is contacted by U-DO. Events are also observed by Wilhelm, who is working with the Testaments to find both Abel and Abel's Ark.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the novel, the narrator, and by extension McGregor, treats disorganized workers with scorn; from the miners of Coal Creek, to the downtrodden laborers of Chicago who are shown mastered by their bosses (unlike McGregor, who does not follow this trend). It is when McGregor comes back to Coal Creek to bury his mother <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> usually jumbled miners marching in step as part of the funeral procession does he have an epiphany that together the workers are a powerful force, to be organized specifically by him. Indeed, this realization is foreshadowed in Chapter 3 of Book I when as a young man he sees a troupe of marching soldiers disperse a rowdy mob of miner's (and, as a consequence, save his family's bakery) during a strike.|$|E

5|$|Roger got {{drawn into}} the {{controversy}} with Becket because Henry II wanted to have his eldest living son crowned as king during Henry's lifetime.(Traditionally, the ceremony is performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury) This was a new practice for England, but was a custom of the Capetian kings of France, which Henry decided to imitate. Henry II insisted that his son, Henry be crowned at Westminster Abbey on 14 June 1170 by Archbishop Roger of York. Also present at the coronation were the bishops of London, Salisbury, Exeter, Chester, Rochester, St Aspah, Llandaff, Durham, Bayeux, Évreux <b>and</b> <b>Sées.</b> <b>The</b> only English bishops absent {{seem to have been}} Winchester, Norwich, Worcester, and of course Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was in exile. The remaining English sees were vacant. This overstepped a long tradition which reserved coronations to the Archbishop of Canterbury, a reservation confirmed as recently as 1166 by Pope Alexander III. In 1170, however, Henry II received papal permission to have Roger crown the younger Henry, a permission which Alexander later revoked.|$|E
