Ford had sympathies with the City Beautiful movement, disliked the unimaginative form of many New York skyscrapers, and had concerns over urban public health, but he also found tall buildings exciting and believed that horizontal visual unity produced boring architecture. As a consequence of Ford's influence, New York's laws were relatively complex and divided up the city into different zones; in each zone, a particular zoning envelope applied, controlling the height to which buildings could be built. Typically a building could only rise up from the sidewalk vertically by around , after which the building had to be set back at a set angle to allow sunlight to reach the street below. On {{a quarter of the}} site, however, the owner could build <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> wished, without any further restrictions.|$|E

The Channel later confirmed this decision, {{at the same time}} announcing that Stargate Atlantis had been picked up for another season. Many fans denounced Gateworld's cancellation announcement, both the timing of it (apparently it had been made while the cast and crew were celebrating the episode's airing)—and the decision itself, on the ground that, while ratings were not <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> had been in previous seasons, the series was still drawing an audience of a respectable size. (For example, it had a season average of 2million viewers in Australia, half of them in the 18–49 demographic.) Sci Fi responded that the cancellation decision had not been based on ratings so much as a feeling the series had run its course.

However, it presently came into my thoughts, that if there were white men among them, it would be much easier to make them understand what we meant as to peace or war, than we found it with others; so tying a piece of white rag {{to the end of a}} stick, we sent two negroes with it to the bank of the water, carrying the pole up <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could; it was presently understood, and two of their men and the white man came to the shore on the other side.|$|E

About two hours after came another king, or captain, with forty or fifty men after him.
