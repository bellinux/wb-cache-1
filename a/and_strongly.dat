This inclines them not to eat poisons avoided by older rats.|$|E

5|$|After Pather Panchali, Ray {{went on to}} make 36 more films, {{including}} feature films, documentaries and shorts. He {{worked on}} scripting, casting, scoring, cinematography, art direction and editing, as well as designing his own credit titles and publicity material. He developed a distinctive style of film-making based, {{as was the case}} with Pather Panchali, on visual lyricism <b>and</b> <b>strongly</b> humanistic themes. Thus, Ray established himself as an internationally recognized auteur of cinema.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{voted in}} the United Nations condemning the human rights {{violations}} in Cuba, but refused to send military forces to Afghanistan and Iraq. Still, Duhalde proposed to send peacekeeping troops, <b>and</b> <b>strongly</b> criticized the regime of Saddam Hussein and international terrorism. Duhalde increased his criticism of the United States during {{the final years of}} his government, and changed the vote in relation to Cuba to an abstention. Those changes were motivated by the upcoming 2003 elections. Menem, who was running for a third term as president, supported the vote condemning Cuba and the military aid to the United States.|$|E

Sold by Etty to a private collector in 1833, it passed through the hands of several more before entering {{the collection of the}} Lady Lever Art Gallery. In 1958 it was acquired by the Tate Gallery, and it remains in the collection of Tate Britain.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{formulated}} the Jay Treaty {{to normalize}} {{trade relations with}} Great Britain, remove them from western forts, and resolve financial debts remaining from the Revolution; John Jay negotiated and signed the treaty on November 19, 1794.

Washington listened to both sides, then announced his strong support, which mobilized public opinion and was pivotal in securing ratification in the Senate on June 24, 1795 by the requisite two-thirds majority.|$|E

Booth {{was a member}} of the {{prominent}} 19th-century Booth theatrical family from Maryland and, by the 1860s, was a well-known actor. He was also a Confederate sympathizer, vehement in his denunciation of Lincoln, <b>and</b> <b>strongly</b> opposed to the abolition of slavery in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Catlins has a cool {{maritime}} temperate climate, somewhat {{cooler than}} {{other parts of}} the South Island, <b>and</b> <b>strongly</b> modified by the effect of the Pacific Ocean. Winds can reach considerable strength, especially on the exposed coast; most of the South Island's storms develop to the south or southwest of the island, and thus the Catlins catches the brunt of many of these weather patterns.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{encouraged}} intermarriage {{with the}} local population, <b>and</b> <b>strongly</b> supported the Roman Catholic Church. In 1560, they started proselytising the local Koli, Kunbi, Kumbhar population in Mahim, Worli, and Bassein. These Christians were referred to by the British as Portuguese Christians, though they were Nestorian Christians who had only recently established ties with the Roman Catholic Church. During this time, Bombay's main trade was coconuts and coir. After Antonio Pessoa's death in 1571, a patent was issued which granted Mazagaon in perpetuity to the Sousa e Lima family. The St. Andrew Church at Bandra was built in 1575.|$|E

5|$|The paws of the cheetah are {{narrower}} {{than those}} of other felids. The slightly curved claws lack a protective sheath and are weakly retractable (semi-retractable). This is a major point of difference between the cheetah and the big cats, which have fully retractable claws, and a similarity to canids. Additionally, the claws of the cheetah are shorter as well as straighter {{than those of}} other cats. Absence of protection makes the claws blunt; however, the large <b>and</b> <b>strongly</b> curved dewclaw is remarkably sharp.|$|E
5|$|Under Carl Duisberg's leadership, Bayer {{was firmly}} {{committed}} {{to the standards of}} ethical drugs, as opposed to patent medicines. Ethical drugs were drugs that could be obtained only through a pharmacist, usually with a doctor's prescription. Advertising drugs directly to consumers was considered unethical <b>and</b> <b>strongly</b> opposed by many medical organizations; that was the domain of patent medicines. Therefore, Bayer was limited to marketing Aspirin directly to doctors.|$|E

5|$|Women's lacrosse, a {{non-contact}} {{version of}} the sport originating in Scotland during the 1890s, is played by twelve players per side, on longer fields and with less protective equipment than the men's game requires.

Box lacrosse is played indoors, with smaller nets, between two teams of six players, <b>and</b> <b>strongly</b> resembles the game its areas were designed for.|$|E
5|$|A later 1994 {{study by}} Novas instead {{classified}} Herrerasaurus within Dinosauria, <b>and</b> <b>strongly</b> supported its position within Saurischia, as well a provided synapomorphies shared with Theropoda. Novas {{found that the}} primitive features of lacking a brevis fossa and having only two sacral vertebrae were simply reversals found in the genus. In 1996, Novas went further by supporting a theropod position for Herrerasaurus with a phylogenetic analysis, which placed it closer to Neotheropoda than Eoraptor or Sauropodomorpha. Langer (2004) mentioned that this hypothesis was widely accepted, but that more later authors instead preferred to place Herrerasaurus as well as Eoraptor basal to Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha, a clade called Eusaurischia. Langer (2004) conducted a phylogenetic analysis, {{and found that it}} was much more likely that Herrerasaurus was a basal saurischian, than either a theropod or a non-dinosaurian. Langer's proposal was supported by multiple studies until the discovery of Tawa, when Nesbitt et al. conducted a more inclusive analysis, and the resulting cladogram placed Herrerasauridae basal to Eoraptor, but closer to Dilophosaurus than Sauropodomorpha. Unlike Nesbitt, Ezcurra (2010) conducted a phylogenetic analysis to place his new taxon Chromogisaurus, and found that Herrerasauridae was basal to Eusaurischia.|$|E
