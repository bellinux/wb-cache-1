5|$|A {{number of}} factors make people more {{susceptible}} to TB infections. The most important risk factor globally is HIV; 13% of all people with TB <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> by the virus. This is a particular problem in sub-Saharan Africa, where rates of HIV are high. Of people without HIV who <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> with tuberculosis, about 5–10% develop active disease during their lifetimes; in contrast, 30% of those coinfected with HIV develop the active disease.|$|E

5|$|In the US, 58% of the {{population}} is infected with HSV-1 and 16% <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> with HSV-2. Among those HSV-2-seropositive, only 19% were aware they were infected. During 2005–2008, the prevalence of HSV-2 was 39% in blacks and 21% in women.|$|E
50|$|On June 10, a Norwegian {{man from}} Vest-Agder was {{confirmed}} to <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> with swine influenza. Although {{he had not}} <b>been</b> <b>infected</b> abroad, he had been living with {{a person who had}} <b>been</b> <b>infected</b> abroad. This <b>was</b> the first domestic infection and was the 12th case of swine influenza in Norway.|$|R
50|$|FIV and HIV {{are both}} lentiviruses. However, humans cannot <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> by FIV, nor can cats <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> by HIV. FIV is {{transmitted}} primarily through saliva (bites), {{such as those}} incurred during territorial battles between males. Cats housed exclusively indoors are {{much less likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>infected,</b> provided they do not come in contact with infected cats.|$|R
40|$|Of 78 Gabonese {{individuals}} who had received bites from nonhuman primates (NHPs) while hunting, 7 <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV- 1). Five had been bitten by gorillas and <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with subtype B strains; however, a 12 -year-old girl who was severely bitten by a Cercopithecus nictitans <b>was</b> <b>infected</b> with a subtype D strain that was {{closely related to the}} simian T lymphotropic virus (STLV- 1) that infects this monkey species. Her mother <b>was</b> <b>infected</b> with a subtype B strain. These data confirm that hunters in Africa can <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> by HTLV- 1 that is closely related to the strains circulating among local NHP game. Our findings strongly suggest that a severe bite represent a risk factor for STLV- 1 acquisition...|$|R
5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> with HIV, they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to grow more profitable, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when family members <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> with HIV, households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing economic stability at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school {{to work in the}} fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|Dengue {{has become}} a global problem since the Second World War and is common in more than 110countries. Each year between 50 and 528million people <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> and {{approximately}} 10,000 to 20,000 die. The earliest descriptions of an outbreak date from 1779. Its viral cause and spread were understood by the early 20th century. Apart from eliminating the mosquitoes, work is ongoing for medication targeted directly at the virus. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease is chronic, and without treatment, they <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> for the {{remainder}} of their lives. However, there is now an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. The treatment of chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by using a similar strategy using lamivudine has been developed.|$|E
40|$|Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) was {{isolated}} from 11 % of 148 Hmong children under 1 year old with diarrhea at {{a refugee camp}} in northern Thailand. Of 16 children with EPEC-associated diarrhea, 11 <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with EPEC that adhered to HeLa cells in a diffuse pattern, 3 <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with EPEC that adhered to HeLa cells in a localized adherence (LA) pattern, and 2 <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with EPEC that were nonadherent. In Bangkok, EPEC {{was isolated}} from 6 % of 64 children under 1 year old with diarrhea and 7 % of 56 children {{of the same age}} without diarrhea. Of four children with diarrhea, two <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with EPEC with an LA pattern, and two <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with nonadherent EPEC. Of four children without diarrhea, one <b>was</b> <b>infected</b> with EPEC with an LA pattern, one <b>was</b> <b>infected</b> with EPEC that adhered in a diffuse pattern, and two <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with nonadherent EPEC. The 21 EPEC isolates with an LA pattern hybridized with the EPEC adherence factor DNA probe. EPEC was the only enteric pathogen identified in 16 (80 %) of 20 children with EPEC-associated diarrhea. EPEC was as frequently isolated from children under 1 year old as were other bacterial enteric pathogens. The problem of identifying EPEC with pools of polyvalent antisera are described, and the need to identify additional enteropathogenic determinants of EPEC is discussed...|$|R
40|$|From three fatal {{cases of}} diarrhoeal illness in Bangladesh, Yersinia species were {{isolated}} from tissues at post-mortem examination. One patient <b>was</b> <b>infected</b> with Y. enterocolitica serotype 0 : 7, 8 and two patients <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with Y. intermedia. These patients <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> also with other enteric pathogens.

40|$|PCR assays {{were used}} to test adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks from Western Siberia, Russia, for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, tick-borne {{encephalitis}} virus (TBEV), and the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) agent. Of the 150 ticks that were studied, 38 % <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with B. burgdorferi, 46 % <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with TBEV, and 8 % <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> with the HGE agent. These three pathogens were distributed in the ticks independently of one another...|$|R
5|$|Poliovirus {{is usually}} spread {{from person to}} person through {{infected}} fecal matter entering the mouth. It may also be spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva. Those who <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> may spread the disease for up to six weeks even if no symptoms are present. The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood. The disease only occurs naturally in humans.|$|E
5|$|Regular {{hand washing}} {{appears to be}} {{effective}} in reducing the transmission of cold viruses, especially among children. Whether the addition of antivirals or antibacterials to normal hand washing provides greater benefit is unknown. Wearing face masks when around people who <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> may be beneficial; however, there is insufficient evidence for maintaining a greater social distance.|$|E
5|$|Cestodes (tapeworms) and digeneans (flukes) cause {{important}} {{diseases in}} humans and their livestock, and monogeneans can cause serious losses of stocks in fish farms. Schistosomiasis, {{also known as}} bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The Carter Center estimated 200million people in 74 countries <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, but often is a chronic illness that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive development of children, and {{increase the risk of}} bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which can bore through human skin. The people most at risk are those who use infected bodies of water for recreation or laundry.|$|E
50|$|Backoff Malware was {{aggressive}} and about 16.2% <b>been</b> <b>infected</b> {{in the third}} quarter of 2014. The survey by Department of Homeland Security(DHS) states that about thousands of businesses have <b>been</b> <b>infected</b> by Backoff POS Malware.|$|R

5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating those who <b>are</b> <b>infected,</b> and male circumcision. Disease in a baby {{can often be}} prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E
5|$|HIV/AIDS is {{diagnosed}} via laboratory testing and then staged {{based on the}} presence of certain signs or symptoms. HIV screening is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force for all people 15years to 65years of age including all pregnant women. Additionally, testing is recommended for those at high risk, which includes anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted illness. In many areas of the world, a third of HIV carriers only discover they <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> at an advanced stage of the disease when AIDS or severe immunodeficiency has become apparent.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 6.6 million people, mostly in Mexico, Central America and South America, have Chagas disease as of 2015. In 2015, Chagas was estimated to result in 8,000 deaths. Most people with the disease are poor, and most do not realize they <b>are</b> <b>infected.</b> Large-scale population movements have increased the areas where Chagas disease is found and these include many European countries and the United States. These areas have also seen {{an increase in the}} years up to 2014. The disease was first described in 1909 by the Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas, after whom it is named. Chagas disease is classified as a neglected tropical disease. It affects more than 150 other animals.|$|E
50|$|Once the router has <b>been</b> <b>infected,</b> {{the attack}} injects many a malware {{in order to}} {{configure}} DDoS attacks. It {{can be used for}} MITM attacks, cookie hijacking and other attacks after the targeted router has <b>been</b> <b>infected.</b>|$|R
50|$|This change occurs {{simply because}} there are now fewer {{susceptibles}} in the population who can <b>be</b> <b>infected.</b> Rq <b>is</b> simply R0 minus those that would normally <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> but that cannot be now since they are immune.|$|R
3000|$|... (A 3) A {{susceptible}} vector can <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> only by {{an infected}} plant host, and after it <b>is</b> <b>infected,</b> it {{will hold the}} virus {{for the rest of}} its life. Further, there is no vertical infection being considered.|$|R
5|$|Many HIV-positive {{people are}} unaware that they <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban {{population}} in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% {{of pregnant women}} attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E
5|$|Not all ticks in an infective area <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> with pathogens, {{and both}} {{attachment}} of the tick and a long-feeding session {{seem to be}} necessary for transmission of these diseases to take place. Thus tick bites often do not lead to infection, especially if the ticks are removed within 36 hours. Adult ticks can be removed with fine-tipped tweezers or proprietary tick removal tools, disinfecting the wound. It is also possible to freeze them off with a medical wart remover. If the tick's head and mouthparts break off during removal, they can be removed with tweezers like a splinter.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{created for}} deer hunting, Richmond Park now has 630 red and fallow deer that roam freely within {{much of the}} park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Some deer are also killed in road accidents, through ingesting litter such as small items of plastic, or by dogs; three deer were killed by dogs in 2012. Many of the deer in Richmond Park <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> with a {{bacterium}} called Borrelia burgdorferi which can be transmitted to humans through a tick bite causing Lyme disease.|$|E

5|$|Plants have {{elaborate}} and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One {{of the most}} effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading. RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants. When they <b>are</b> <b>infected,</b> plants often produce natural disinfectants that kill viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen molecules.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{store their}} entire genomes {{in the form}} of RNA, and contain no DNA at all. Because they use RNA to store genes, their {{cellular}} hosts may synthesize their proteins as soon as they <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> and without the delay in waiting for transcription. On the other hand, RNA retroviruses, such as HIV, require the reverse transcription of their genome from RNA into DNA before their proteins can be synthesized. RNA-mediated epigenetic inheritance has also been observed in plants and very rarely in animals.|$|E
5|$|The habitat {{includes}} {{various kinds}} of wetlands, such as lakes, marshes, and rivers. Oryzomys species swim well, are active during the night, and eat both plant and animal food. They build woven nests of vegetation. After a gestation period of 21 to 28days, about four young are born. Species of Oryzomys <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> by numerous parasites and carry at least three hantaviruses, one of which (Bayou virus) also infects humans. Two, maybe three, species have gone extinct {{over the last two}} centuries and at least one other is endangered, but the widespread marsh rice rat and O.couesi are not threatened.|$|E
50|$|Until {{recently}} {{humans and}} water fleas (Cyclops) {{were regarded as}} the only animals this parasite <b>infects.</b> It has <b>been</b> shown that baboons, cats, dogs, frogs and catfish (Synodontis) can also <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> naturally. Ferrets can <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> experimentally.|$|R
50|$|Vesivirus {{infectivity}} and cytopathology {{can vary}} with the strain, species, and the cell type that <b>is</b> <b>infected.</b> Some animals may only <b>be</b> <b>infected</b> for a short time, but other animals such as chimpanzees may have persistent recurring infections.|$|R
