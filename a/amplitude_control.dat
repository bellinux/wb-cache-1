5000|$|In June 1938, Terman, Buss, Hewlett and Cahill gave a {{presentation}} about negative feedback at the IRE Convention in New York; in August 1938, {{there was a}} second presentation at the IRE Pacific Coast Convention in Portland, OR; the presentation became an IRE paper.

50|$|In the encoder, {{the input}} is {{passed through a}} {{multiband}} filter, then each band is passed through an envelope follower, and the control signals from the envelope followers are transmitted to the decoder. The decoder applies these (<b>amplitude)</b> <b>control</b> signals to corresponding filters for re-synthesis. Since these control signals change only slowly compared to the original speech waveform, the bandwidth required to transmit speech can be reduced. This allows more speech channels to share a single communication channel, such as a radio channel or a submarine cable (i.e. multiplexing).|$|E
50|$|Hewlett used an {{incandescent}} bulb {{as a power}} detector, {{low pass}} filter and gain control element in the oscillator feedback path to control the output amplitude. The resistance of the light bulb filament (see resistivity article) increases as its temperature increases. The temperature of the filament depends on the power dissipated in the filament and some other factors. If the oscillator's period (an inverse of its frequency) is significantly shorter than the thermal time constant of the filament, then {{the temperature of the}} filament will be substantially constant over a cycle. The filament resistance will then determine the amplitude of the output signal. If the amplitude increases, the filament heats up and its resistance increases. The circuit is designed so that a larger filament resistance reduces loop gain, which in turn will reduce the output amplitude. The result is a negative feedback system that stabilizes the output amplitude to a constant value. With this form of <b>amplitude</b> <b>control,</b> the oscillator operates as a near ideal linear system and provides a very low distortion output signal. Oscillators that use limiting for <b>amplitude</b> <b>control</b> often have significant harmonic distortion. At low frequencies, as the time period of the Wien bridge oscillator approaches the thermal time constant of the incandescent bulb, the circuit operation becomes more nonlinear, and the output distortion rises significantly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{sine wave}} with high {{frequency}} and high voltage {{is a key}} driving signal for EMCCD to realize electron multiplication. According to signal requirements, DDS technique based on FPGA is employed and then sine-formed code-stream is converted to low-voltage sine wave by a digital/analog device. Afterwards, filtering and high-voltage amplification are used to acquire the sine wave with high frequency and high voltage. For the high-voltage amplification, the transfer function of the circuit system is used to correct the circuit parameters, and at last linear amplified sine wave signal with the functions of phase adjusting and <b>amplitude</b> <b>controlling</b> is obtained.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} quantitative EEG (qEEG) in {{anorexia nervosa}} (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) {{in comparison with}} healthy controls. METHODS: Resting EEG was recorded in 30 healthy females (age: 27. 1 +/- 5. 5), 16 -AN females (age: 26. 4 +/- 9. 5) and 12 -BN females (age: 27. 0 +/- 6. 3). Cortical EEG sources (delta, theta, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2) were modeled by LORETA solutions. The {{statistical analysis was performed}} considering the factors Group, power Band, and region of interest (central, frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal, limbic). RESULTS: Alpha 1 sources in central, parietal, occipital and limbic areas showed a greater <b>amplitude</b> in <b>Controls</b> versus AN and BN groups. Alpha 2 sources in parietal, occipital and limbic areas showed a greater <b>amplitude</b> in <b>Controls</b> than in both AN and BN groups.

5000|$|During live events where {{signals from}} {{microphones}} are amplified {{and sent to}} speaker systems, equalization is not only used to [...] "flatten" [...] the frequency response but may also be useful in eliminating feedback. When the sound produced by the speakers is {{picked up by a}} microphone, it is further reamplified; this recirculation of sound can lead to [...] "howling" [...] requiring the sound technician to reduce the gain for that microphone, perhaps sacrificing the contribution of a singer's voice for instance. Even at a slightly reduced gain, the feedback will still cause an unpleasant resonant sound around the frequency at which it would howl. But because the feedback is troublesome at a particular frequency, it is possible to cut the gain only around that frequency while preserving the gain at most other frequencies. This can best be done using a parametric equalizer tuned to that very frequency with its <b>amplitude</b> <b>control</b> sharply reduced. By adjusting the equalizer for a narrow bandwidth (high Q), most other frequency components will not be affected. The extreme case when the signal at the filter's center frequency is completely eliminated is known as a notch filter.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Schematic {{drawing of}} an examplary FM-AFM setup using a silicon {{cantilever}} in ultra-high vacuum and a PLL for phase detection and {{generation of the}} excitation signal. A very small tip is mounted on an oscillating cantilever (1) that is in vicinity of a sample (in this case the cantilever is below the sample). The oscillation of the cantilever changes upon interaction between the tip and the sample and is detected with a laser beam (2) focussed {{on the back of}} the cantilever. The reflected beam travels via mirrors to a position sensitive detector (PSD) (3). The signal of the PSD is amplified by a preamplifier. An <b>amplitude</b> <b>control</b> (4) measures the amplitude A of this signal and a feedback loop compares it with a setpoint and determines the amplification (dissipation Γ) of the excitation signal (6) for the cantilever which is fed to a shaking piezo. To measure the current resonance frequency, a phase-locked loop (PLL) (5) is used. Its voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) produces the excitation signal (6) for the cantilever. The detected frequency shift ∆f is passed to another feedback loop (7) that keeps the frequency shift constant by changing the distance between the tip and the surface (z position) by varying the voltage applied to the piezo tube.|$|E
50|$|Features include four voltage-controlled {{oscillators}} (VCOs) with tuning, footage (16, 8, 4, 2), waveshape (triangle, saw, pulse-width, and pulse-width modulated), and amplitude. The first oscillator is {{the master}} oscillator as far as fine tuning goes. Two direct modifiers to the VCOs are a detune control that only affects oscillators 2 and 4, and a Pulse Width control that goes to cancellation either side of 50% phase symmetry of a square wave; pulse width can be routed to MG1, MG2, or voltage-controlled filter (VCF) envelope. There is one independent noise generator with an <b>amplitude</b> <b>control</b> (frequency and shape is modified by the VCF). There is one 24/db octave exponential low-pass VCF with resonance, scaling and invertible envelope control shared across all four VCOs. One voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA) envelope with triggering and dampering controls is shared across all four VCOs. There are two low frequency modulators: MG1 controls VCO Pitch/Pulse-width, 'EFFECTS' and VCF cutoff; MG2 controls the tempo of the arpeggiator, and Pulse-Width. There is one arpeggiator with on/off/latch control, up/down/up-down pitch control, and 1/2/full keyboard control (44 notes). The arpeggiator can cycle through each oscillator in POLY mode, or all four {{at a time in}} MONO. There is an 'EFFECTS' section which includes an amplitude modulator (X-MOD) with hard-sync control, and a frequency modulator with which the frequency of the modulator can be altered by the VCF envelope or MG1. For both modulators there is the option of single modulation of all oscillators, or two carriers, and two modulators (using the VCOs). Controller Interfaces are external inputs/outputs for CV/Trigger, VCF and VCO mod inputs, arpeggiator, portamento, and the pitch/MG1 mod wheels can be assigned to control VCO1 pitch, pitch or the filter. Bender goes to 2.5 octaves +/- for Pitch and full range for VCF cutoff. There are 5 different oscillator assignment modes: 'Hold' drones the oscillators until force dampered or Chord Memory is activated; 'Chord Memory (MONO)' allows 2-4 oscillators (VCOs) to be set to any arrangement across 44 keys (for example, in organ or rave chords); 'Unison (MONO)' stacks all 4 oscillators; and 'Unison/Share', which defaults to Unison with one note played, but divides the oscillators across the notes as 2 or more are played. Poly is without explanation, and oscillators always play in sequenced order from 1-4.|$|E
