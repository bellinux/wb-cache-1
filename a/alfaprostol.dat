50|$|<b>Alfaprostol</b> is a {{bioactive}} analog of prostaglandin F2α. <b>Alfaprostol</b> is a luteolytic agent used injectably for scheduling of estrus in mares {{for purposes}} of planned breeding. It is also used for treating of postweaning anestrus in economically important farm animals. For these purposes, <b>alfaprostol</b> is more potent than naturally occurring prostaglandin F2α.|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>alfaprostol</b> in inducing abortion was tested in 93 pregnant heifers. <b>Alfaprostol</b> was injected intramuscularly,. 7 mg per 100 pounds body weight. Twenty-four heifers were injected when they averaged 83 days (range 64 to 86) pregnant, while 23 were injected when 138 days (range 119 - 143) pregnant. A control injection of the <b>Alfaprostol</b> carrier, propylene glycol, was given 23 heifers averaging 81 or 134 days pregnant. By 14 {{days after the}} <b>Alfaprostol</b> injection 79 % of the heifers 83 days pregnant and 96 % of the heifers 138 days pregnant had aborted. Two of the 83 -day controls {{and none of the}} 138 day controls aborted. Since <b>Alfaprostol</b> (5. 4 mg) was very effective up to at least 140 days of pregnancy, but somewhat less effective earlier, the dosage may need to be increased for lighted or earlier pregnancy heifers. No serious side effects were noted in aborted heifers...|$|E
40|$|One-hundred {{eighteen}} heifers {{were used}} to determine the effectiveness of <b>Alfaprostol</b> as a heat synchronization agent. Seventy-nine were injected twice (12 days apart) with 6 mg <b>Alfaprostol</b> per head and 39 were not treated. Twelve to 96 hours after the second injection 88. 6 % of the treated heifers were in standing heat and 81. 4 % of those in heat conceived at the first insemination. Eighty-one percent of the 37 untreated heifers in heat the first 21 days conceived at the first insemination. Ninety-one percent of the treated heifers and 89. 2 % of the untreated heifers conceived within a 50 -day breeding period, so <b>Alfaprostol</b> did not affect reproductive performance...|$|E
40|$|Alfavet® (<b>alfaprostol),</b> an {{experimental}} prostaglandin analog for inducing abortion in feedlot heifers, was evaluated for efficacy. Abortion was induced within 8 days following injection of 5 mg <b>alfaprostol</b> in 45 of 51 heifers (88. 2 %) ranging from 40 to 150 days in gestation. Bovilene® (fenprostalene), injected at 1 mg per head resulted in abortion in 45 of 49 heifers (91. 8 %) of similar pregnancy status. Both products were 95 - 100 % effective from 40 to 120 days of pregnancy, but only 75 % effective from 121 to 150 days...|$|E
40|$|From {{the end of}} November to {{the middle}} of April, heats {{duration}} and ovulation ways were studied on 70 buffalo cows kept apart from bulls. Resultsd referred to 324 spontaneous heats and 102 inducted by <b>Alfaprostol.</b> It was found a mutual relation between heats duration and ovulation time either in controls (r= 0. 59 ***). During the months characterized by a decrease of reproductive activity it is necessary to use both progesterone determination in milk and prostaglandine administration. Trough these devices a greater number of useful ovulations can be obtained in 48 Hrs. In December, when the reproductive activity is more favourable, <b>Alfaprostol</b> administration proved to be useful considering it alowed to operate also in case of silent heats, which occur frequently (34. 3 % of spontaneous heats observed) during this period...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} role of endothelial factors in luteal function, the dynamic {{profiles}} of genes for endothelin 1 (EDN 1), its receptor subtypes, EDNRA and EDNRB, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) were examined in corpora lutea (CL) obtained from rabbits on Days 4 and 9 of pseudopregnancy after prostaglandin (PG) F 2 alpha analogue (<b>alfaprostol)</b> treatment. The cell type distribution of EDN 1 in the ovaries and its mechanisms of actions in vitro and in vivo were also studied. Positive immunostaining for EDN 1 was localized in the luteal and endothelial cells, in granulosa cells of the follicles, and in the ovarian epithelium. The basal mRNA levels for EDNRA, EDNRB, and ACE were lower (P </= 0. 01) in Day- 4 CL than in Day- 9 CL, whereas those for EDN 1 did not differ between these two time-points. On Day 4, the luteal EDN 1, EDNRA, EDNRB, and ACE mRNA levels were similarly increased two-fold (P </= 0. 01) 1. 5 h after <b>alfaprostol</b> injection, and did not show further changes in the subsequent 24 h. On Day 9, <b>alfaprostol</b> challenge transiently up-regulated (P </= 0. 01) the luteal ACE transcripts at 1. 5 h, and those of EDN 1 at 1. 5 h and 3 h, whereas the EDNRA and EDNRB transcript levels remained unchanged {{during the course of}} luteal regression. EDN 1 decreased (P </= 0. 01) progesterone release and increased (P </= 0. 01) PGF 2 alpha secretion and NOS activity via the PLC/PKC pathway in Day- 9 CL, but not in Day- 4 CL, cultured in vitro. EDN 1 -induced, but not alfaprostol-induced luteolysis, was blocked by cotreatment in vivo with the ACE antagonist captopril. These findings support the hypothesis that PGF 2 alpha regulates luteolysis through intraluteal activation of the renin-angiotensin/EDN 1 systems in CL that have acquired luteolytic competence...|$|E

Double ovulation influence negatively the pregnancy diagnosis reliability, 19 - 22 days after insemination, by milk progesterone assay.

40|$|Data Mediterranean buffalo heats (324 {{spontaneous}} and 97 inducted by <b>alfaprostol)</b> have been examined. Three {{different levels of}} average temperature, thermic range, rainess and daylight were refered. Results showed that reproductive activity of buffalo breed in Italy is influenced by climatic conditions. A delay of the pituitary response to the ovaric steroisds, either in spontaneous or induced heats, occurs beyond 11 hours of daylight and with temperature below 8 °C (cold springs). The oldest buffaloes feel mostly the climatic conditions, particularly when rainfall reduces...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the responses of Black Bengal Goat following synchronization with <b>alfaprostol,</b> superovulation with PMSG and embryo collection with surgical procedure. This research work was carried out at the Department of Surgery and Obstetrics, Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) during the period from January to December 2001. Three Flushing schedules have been carried out in one-year time consisting of 5 donor and 4 recipients in Flush I, 2 donors and 4 recipients in Flush II, and 4 donors and 3 recipients in Flush III. The donors as well as the recipients were synchronized with Gabbrostim ® (<b>Alfaprostol,</b> VETEM, Italy) at the dose rate of 2 -mg equivalent to 1 ml/goat. Among 11 donors only 6 donors responded following first injection, but all donor responded with second and third injection of Gabbrostim ®. The mean time of onset of oestrus and duration of oestrus in donor were 29. 9 ± 9. 20 h, 50. 0 ± 5. 94 h, 47. 8 ± 4. 05 h and 20. 9 ± 5. 10 h, 27. 9 ± 1. 19 h, 29. 4 ± 1. 36 h respectively. Among 11 recipient does, only 6 responded following first injection of Gabbrostim, while that of second injection was 9. The mean time of onset of oestrus and duration of oestrus were 28. 6 ± 9. 69 h, 40. 1 ± 8. 95 h and 17. 1 ± 5. 05 h, 22. 5 ± 3. 45 h respectively. All 9 recipients responded in third injection and the mean time of onset of oestrus and duration of oestrus were 39. 9 ± 5. 06 h and 27. 4 ± 1. 32 h respectively. In all flushing schedules, superovulation was performed using PMSG (Folligon ®, Intervet International B. V, Holland) at the dose rate of 900 IU, 800 IU and 700 IU respectively. Both natural service and AI was performed to fertilise the ovum after onset of oestrus...|$|E
40|$|The {{responsiveness}} of rabbit {{corpus luteum}} to 200 micrograms of the prostaglandin F 2 alpha (PGF 2 alpha) analogue, <b>alfaprostol,</b> between Days 3 and 9 of pseudopregnancy {{was assessed by}} evaluating the decline in plasma progesterone after treatment with PGF 2 alpha in 81 New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits. On Days 3 - 5, functional luteolysis was not observed. On Days 6, 7, and 8 of pseudopregnancy, the number of rabbits responsive to PGF 2 alpha, rose from 38 % to 71 % and 83 %, respectively. In the other cases, {{the effect of the}} PGF 2 alpha analogue was transient as CL recovered in the following 2 or 3 days. By contrast, on Day 9 luteolysis was effective and persistent in all the animals. In rabbits treated on Day 9, progesterone decreased gradually from 10. 6 +/- 0. 7 within the first 6 h, but fell to 3. 6 +/- 1. 5 ng/mL (p < 0. 01) 12 h after PGF 2 alpha and to 0. 2 +/- 0. 1 ng/mL (p < 0. 01) 24 h later...|$|E
