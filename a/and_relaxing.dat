5|$|Hitachi {{listed the}} Magic Wand for {{business}} {{use with the}} United States Patent and Trademark Office on 25 April 1968. Kabushiki Kaisha Hitachi Seisakusho registered the trademark to the Magic Wand.

It is effective at relieving pain associated with back aches, and is registered with the Food and Drug Administration as a physical medicine device under the classification therapeutic electric massager. The stated use of the Magic Wand is the soothing <b>and</b> <b>relaxing</b> of sore muscles and nerves, relieving tension, and rehabilitation after sports injuries.|$|E
5|$|The life of {{the royal}} family was {{relatively}} quiet and withdrawn. The Athenian court was not as brilliant and sumptuous as that of Saint Petersburg, and days in the Greek capital were sometimes monotonous for members {{of the royal family}}. In spring and winter, they divided time between the Royal Palace in Athens, and Tatoi Palace at the foot of Mount Parnitha. Summers were spent on vacation at Aix-les-Bains in France, visiting relatives in the Russian capital or at Fredensborg and Bernstorff in Denmark, <b>and</b> <b>relaxing</b> at Mon Repos, Corfu.|$|E

5|$|Chao {{are small}} creatures with a pudding-like body and behave much like human infants, with {{pleasant}} <b>and</b> <b>relaxing</b> personalities. Professor Chao, a minor character in Sonic Adventure 2, states that Chao are cute, and enjoy toys and being held or petted. However, they dislike being held while the player jumps, spins around, or throws them. Chao's diets consist of tree fruit and coconuts. Chao hatch from eggs found in Chao Gardens. When the player spends enough {{time with a}} Chao in the Chao Garden, the Chao develops a cocoon; it hatches from this as an adult. Eventually it develops another cocoon. If the Chao has been treated well, the cocoon is pink and the Chao is reincarnated as an egg; the cycle then restarts and the Chao remembers the player. If, however, the Chao has been treated poorly, the cocoon is gray and the Chao dies, removing every trace of itself from the game. Chao can breed to produce fertile eggs.|$|E

25|$|The halakha {{requires}} {{eating and}} traditionally {{sleeping in the}} sukkah. However, Jews {{are not expected to}} remain in the sukkah if they would be very uncomfortable there. For this reason, Jews living at northern latitudes will generally not sleep in the sukkah due to the cold temperatures of autumn nights. Some Jews in these locales will spend some time in the sukkah eating <b>and</b> <b>relaxing</b> but go indoors to sleep.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{specifically}} {{is essential}} for bone health and {{seems to have a}} role in skin elasticity and nervous system function. Other effects seen with progesterone include reducing spasms <b>and</b> <b>relaxing</b> smooth muscle tone; reducing gallbladder activity; widening bronchi, which helps respiration; reducing inflammation and immune response; and normalizing blood clotting and vascular tone, zinc and copper levels, cell oxygen levels, and use of fat stores for energy. Progesterone also assists in thyroid function and bone building by osteoblasts.|$|E
25|$|Restless leg {{syndrome}} is a disorder in which patients feel uncomfortable or unpleasant sensations in the legs. These sensations usually {{occur in the}} evening, while the patient is sitting or lying down <b>and</b> <b>relaxing.</b> Patients {{feel like they have}} to move their legs to relieve the sensations, and walking generally makes the symptoms disappear. In many patients, this can lead to insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. This is a very common problem and can occur at any age.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, Broken Arrow {{began to}} grow {{from a small town}} into a {{suburban}} city. The Broken Arrow Expressway (Oklahoma State Highway 51) was constructed in the mid-1960s and connected the city with downtown Tulsa, fueling growth in Broken Arrow. The population swelled from a little above 11,000 in 1970 to more than 50,000 in 1990, and then more than 74,000 by the year 2000. During this time, the city was more of a bedroom community. In recent years, city leaders have pushed for more economic development to help keep more Broken Arrowans working, shopping <b>and</b> <b>relaxing</b> in town rather than going to other cities.|$|E
25|$|The Muqaddimah {{emphasized}} {{the role of}} systemic bias in affecting the standard of evidence. Khaldun was quite concerned with the effect of raising the standard of evidence when confronted with uncomfortable claims, <b>and</b> <b>relaxing</b> it when given claims that seemed reasonable or comfortable. He was a jurist, and sometimes participated reluctantly in rulings that he felt were coerced, based on arguments he didn't respect. Besides al-Maqrizi (1364–1442), Ibn Khaldun's focused attempt to systematically study and account biases {{in the creation of}} history wouldn't be seen again until Georg Hegel, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Nietzsche in 19th-century Germany, and Arnold J. Toynbee, a 20th-century British historian.|$|E

25|$|Storytelling in {{indigenous}} cultures {{is sometimes}} passed on by oral means {{in a quiet}} <b>and</b> <b>relaxing</b> environment, which usually coincides with family or tribal community gatherings and official events such as family occasions, rituals, or ceremonial practices. During the telling of the story, children may act as participants by asking questions, acting out the story, or telling smaller parts of the story. Furthermore, stories are not often told {{in the same manner}} twice, resulting in many variations of a single myth. This is because narrators may choose to insert new elements into old stories dependent upon the relationship between the storyteller and the audience, making the story correspond to each unique situation.|$|E
25|$|Other {{methods of}} {{refrigeration}} include the {{air cycle machine}} used in aircraft; the vortex tube used for spot cooling, when compressed air is available; and thermoacoustic refrigeration using sound waves in a pressurized gas to drive heat transfer and heat exchange; steam jet cooling popular in the early 1930s for air conditioning large buildings; thermoelastic cooling using a smart metal alloy stretching <b>and</b> <b>relaxing.</b> Many Stirling cycle heat engines can be run backwards {{to act as a}} refrigerator, and therefore these engines have a niche use in cryogenics. In addition there are other types of cryocoolers such as Gifford-McMahon coolers, Joule-Thomson coolers, pulse-tube refrigerators and, for temperatures between 2 mK and 500 mK, dilution refrigerators.|$|E
