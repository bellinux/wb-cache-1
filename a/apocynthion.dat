During the Apollo program, the terms pericynthion and <b>apocynthion</b> (referencing Cynthia, an alternative name for the Greek Moon goddess Artemis) were used when referring to the Moon. Regarding black holes, the term peri/apomelasma (from a Greek root) was used by physicist Geoffrey A. Landis in 1998 before peri/aponigricon (from a Latin) appeared in the scientific literature in 2002.|$|E
