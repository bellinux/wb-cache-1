50|$|Despite {{the claims}} of the relaxer being safe and natural, the product {{contained}} <b>copper,</b> <b>ammonium,</b> and <b>chloride</b> salts and a pH of less than the listed level of 3. Due to these factors, people using the product suffered from hair loss, scalp burns, and (in some cases) green hair color. By 1995, there were over 3,000 complaints lodged with the Food and Drug Administration. Eventually, the product was barred from being imported into the U.S., and all remaining company stocks were destroyed. Several victims (about 53,000) filed a class action lawsuit against World Rio Corporation, resulting in a judgment of US$4.5 million. The incident also raised questions about the issue of relaxing afro-textured hair in general.|$|R

The sample was characterized by Nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy.

Compared with the dense CuO microspheres, the obtained MPH-CuO shows an enhanced electrochemical performance with a higher capacity of 599. 4 mAh/g and a better cyclability (484 mAh/g after 15 cycles) because of its mesoporous hollow structure that provides quick intercalation and large accommodation of lithium ions together with short diffusion distance for lithium ions, suggesting a potential application in Li-ion batteries...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of copper as tribasic <b>copper</b> <b>chloride</b> on serum biochemical values and growth performance of broilers intoxicated with aflatoxins. Aflatoxins significantly decreased the level of albumin (P < 0. 001), total protein (P < 0. 001) and total cholesterol (P < 0. 01), and increased the activities of alanine amino transferase, L-lactic dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase (P £ 0. 001) in serum. These AF-induced changes were significantly improved by adding tribasic <b>copper</b> <b>chloride</b> to the diet. The decrease in serum copper concentration induced by aflatoxin was reversed by tribasic <b>copper</b> <b>chloride.</b> Serum zinc concentrations were not affected in tribasic <b>copper</b> <b>chloride</b> and tribasic <b>copper</b> <b>chloride</b> plus aflatoxin groups. Serum iron levels decreased in all the treatment groups significantly (P < 0. 05).

Copper is an essential nutrient but in excess concentration responsible for environmental pollution. The excess of copper is released from many industries to cause soil and water pollution.

In the present study, the seedlings of (cow pea) Vigna unguiculata (L) walp were treated with various concentrations of <b>copper</b> <b>chloride</b> {{and its impact on the}} morphometric, pigmental, biochemical and enzymatic characters were studied.

50|$|Seeding is {{introduced}} during crystallization. The production is operated continuously under well-defined conditions (pH, feeding rate, concentrations, temperature, etc.).

5000|$|Further {{complicating the}} Wacker process {{mechanism}} is {{questions about the}} role of <b>copper</b> <b>chloride.</b> Most theories assumed copper does not {{play a role in the}} olefin oxidation mechanisms.

Work by Hosokawa and coworkers yielded a crystallized product containing <b>copper</b> <b>chloride,</b> indicating it may have a non-innocent role in olefin oxidation. Finally, an ab initio study by Comas-Vives, et al. [...] involving no copper co-catalyst found anti-addition was the preferred pathway. This pathway was later confirmed by copper-free experiments by Anderson and Sigman. Interestingly, a different kinetic rate law with no proton dependence was found under copper-free conditions, indicating the possibility that even small amounts of copper co-catalysts may have non-innocent roles on this chemistry. While these works complicate the picture of the Wacker process mechanism, one should probably infer that this and related chemistry can be sensitive to reaction conditions, and multiple different reaction pathways may be in play.|$|R
