5|$|Tangascootack Creek's {{watershed}} covers 36.4 {{square miles}} (94km2) {{in the southern}} part of Clinton County, half of which is the watershed for North Fork Tangascootack Creek. A small amount of the watershed, less than 1%, has occasional residential uses, including sport camps <b>and</b> <b>summer</b> retreats. In formerly strip-mined areas there are patches of grassland and reforestation. Almost all of the area that is considered impaired by the Environmental Protection Agency, is forested. However, in areas where strip mining was done in the past, there are patches of grassland or reforested land. This land includes sports camps <b>and</b> <b>summer</b> retreats.|$|E

5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} the spring <b>and</b> <b>summer</b> populations, but most adults {{from the earlier}} {{emergence}} die {{before the end of}} summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely to be a major contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E

5|$|During {{the spring}} <b>and</b> <b>summer,</b> {{conditions}} {{along the east}} coast of Australia are highly conducive for the formation of hailstorms. The variation of air temperature in the atmosphere; with warm and humid air close to the ground and colder air above it causes instability, and the cold upper atmosphere temperatures allow the precipitation to fall in solid form as hailstones. Since records began in 1791, hailstorms in the month of January form approximately 13% {{of the total number of}} hailstorms in the Sydney metropolitan area, and over 15% of all events with 'large hail'.|$|E
