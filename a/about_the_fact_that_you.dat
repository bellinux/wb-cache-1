You can't be human all by yourself, and when you have this quality - Ubuntu - you are known for your generosity.We think of ourselves far too frequently as just individuals, separated from one another, whereas you are connected and what you do affects the whole World. When you do well, it spreads out; it is for the whole of humanity.|$|E

[...] Though Flowers made millions for the state during his term, Flowers also stated, [...] "When I went to Dover every day, I saw people who were thinking about themselves.

5000|$|Basically, it's <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can't hide what you're really like. I {{just had}} {{this image of}} the average American hero - {{somebody}} like a Clint Eastwood or a John Wayne. Somebody with eyes like slits, who was basically capable of anything - you know, any kind of murderous act or whatever to get what was required - to get, let's say, his people to safety. And yet, to those people he's saving, he's a great hero, a {{knight in shining armor}} - forget the fact that he cut off fifty people's heads to get them home safely. Then I thought about the Russians and the Chinese and the Arab communities and the South Americans; you've got these different ethnic groups, and each has this central image of every other political or national faction as being, in some way, the evil ones. And I've taken this a little bit further - because I spent so much of my time in society, high society, last year - to comment on stardom and power and drug use and decadence, and how there's a strange parallel, in a way, between the misuse of power and responsibility by inept politicians and the misuse of power and responsibility by people who are heroes. If you're really a good person, you can't hide it by acting bad; and if you're a bad person, you can't hide it by acting good. Also - more to the point, really - that there's no outward, identifiable evil, you know? People {{spend most of their time}} looking for evil and identifying evil outside themselves. But the potential for evil is inside you.|$|E
50|$|Duritz said abouth this song: -So {{you leave}} home.. and {{you fall in}} love again. And I found myself on the Southeastern tip of America in love with a {{different}} girl, years later. And I had been off on a bus and she went off on a plane {{to the other side of}} the world to work and I hadn’t seen her. But she was coming home after a few months to see me and she was meeting me there, at the edge of America. I went to the airport to pick her up and went down to the gates- it’s weird to think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could go to the gates then. And I sat there and I waited for her to come. And uh, the planes came one by one down the runway, and the sun extinguished itself on the ocean. And I thought about how much I missed her, and then I got this sick feeling in this pit of my stomach cause I knew I was still the same and I knew I would leave. I mean, I was happy she was coming home, but it was temporary. Like everything back then. You could have everything in the palm of your hand and know that it is the same thing as having nothing at all. This world, this life gives you everything and nothing at the same time and doesn’t exactly tell you how to deal with that. The truth is you have to hold them both. I didn’t know how to do that. How do you live with loving something and knowing you’re going to throw it away? I stood there and watched the sun go down and her plane landed and she came home and I kissed her. And we went back to our hotel, in Miami. (10/1/08 Atlanta, GA).|$|E
