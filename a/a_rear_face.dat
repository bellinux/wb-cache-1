40|$|Effectiveness of {{two devices}} to {{suppress}} the cavity acoustics was computationally investigated. Two dimensional, computational simulations were performed for the transonic, turbulent flows past a cavity, which was first equipped with <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> <b>face</b> ramp {{and then with a}} spoiler. The Reynolds-averaged, unsteady, compressible, full Navier-Stokes equations were solved time accurately by a second-order accurate, implicit, upwind, finite-volume method. The effect of turbulence was included through a Baldwin-Lomax model with modifications for the multiple-wall effects and for the highly vortical flow with a shear layer. The results included instantaneous and time-averaged flow properties, and time-series analyses of the pressure inside the cavity, which compared favorably with the available experimental data. These results were also contrasted with the computed aeroacoustics of the same cavity (length-to-depth ratio of 4. 5), but without a device, to demonstrate the suppression effectiveness...|$|E

40|$|Describes a pump {{that has}} a fixed gear axis {{eccentricity}} and varies displacement by moving controlling elements linearly along the drive shaft. A pressure compensator may be employed to displace the controlling elements. It includes a housing penetrated by a drive shaft rotating internal elements. The internal components slide along the longitudinal axis established by the drive shaft to vary the fluid displacement. The axially-moving elements include the drive shaft, inner gerotor element, port plug, thrust bearing and retainer sleeve. The drive shaft includes an internal flanged forming a piston.

40|$|Part I: Surgical Tool Design. The primary {{objective}} of this thesis was {{the development of a}} surgical tool to implant a specialized micro-scale sensor into the anterior chamber of a mouse eye. The sensor measures intra-ocular pressure continuously under normal living conditions, creating a measurement system that is needed in the field of Glaucoma research. The sensor has a complex geometry comprised of both compliant and non-compliant materials, and requires careful handling. ^ Previously, the surgical procedure required three separate tools; a knife, a syringe and needle, and forceps. That procedure suffered from issues of ease of use, efficiency, safety and reliability. The objective was to design, fabricate, and test a single unified tool that could perform all necessary surgical functions. The motivation for unifying the toolset into a single device was primarily to improve surgical efficiency and ease of use. ^ The development of the surgical tool faced a number of different challenges. These issues pertained to creating a sharp cutting instrument within unusual geometrical constraints, loading the sensor into a narrow tube, delivering both fluid and an object through the same tube, optimizing dimensions against competing constraints, and satisfying the ergonomic needs of the surgeon. ^ Two generations of prototypes were fabricated and tested. The second generation prototype was comprised of three telescoping tubes, each with a specific function. All three surgical steps were successfully carried out on a cadaver pig eye, with minor complications in the handling of the tool. Due to inherent design constraints in the implant and available materials, the size of the tool is likely more appropriate for the anatomy of a larger animal. ^ Part II: The Effects of Leg Morphology on Running Performance. The secondary {{objective of this}} thesis was to explore how differences in joint morphology impact the dynamics and energetics of running. An analysis was completed on the effects of kinematic knee orientation on legged locomotion, specifically simple running patterns. ^ The analysis compared the dynamics of a forward facing knee found in humans, <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> <b>facing</b> ankle found in birds, and a linear knee found in pogo sticks and simple robots. ^ The equations of motion for the models reveal that joint orientation has a direct effect on the dynamics of the system. The early simulation results show that leg morphology directly effects deflection and force patterns, which in turn effects the trajectory of the system. In forward facing joints, hip torque increases ground reaction forces, creating the appearance of higher compliance in the leg. In <b>rear</b> <b>facing</b> joints, hip torque decreases ground reaction forces, creating the appearance of lower compliance in the leg. The results suggest that a forward facing knee joint found in humans is more energy efficient than <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> <b>facing</b> ankle joint found in birds. ...|$|R

The cut-in vehicle used was equipped with <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> <b>facing</b> radar unit enabling it to monitor the degree and speed with which drivers attempted to restore their original headway. ‘Cut-ins’ from both directions were examined – moving in from a slower lane (94 events) as well as from a faster lane (72 events). The criticality experienced by the follower vehicle ranged from moderately severe (time to collision around 10 s and time gap around 0. 35 s) to non critical (lead car’s speed at cut in greater than follower speed and time headway beyond steady state values). Findings have revealed that the ‘pullback’ behaviour, at least over the initial 5 - 10 seconds, can be described by a constant ‘pull back’ speed (the rate of decrease of the initial speed), and causative models for this response have been derived using ‘instantaneous’ variables (those that may be calculated on cut-in, such as relative speed and TTC for example) and longer term ‘target’ variables, such as desired headway, the former of which have been found as being most effective in describing behaviour. Lastly, empirical responses have been compared to those that would be produced by ACC systems where we find that a comparatively close match is produced for low values of relative spee...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: the AAP {{recommends}} preterm infants {{undergo a}} “car seat challenge” before discharge, to observe for any differences in cardiorespiratory function whilst {{seated in a}} car seat compared to lying flat in a cot. The infant can be discharged {{if there is no}} compromise. This static (30 °) challenge {{does not take into account}} the more vertical positioning of the seat or effects of vibration when it is secured in a moving vehicle. Aim: to investigate the effect of vibration, mimicking that experienced in a moving car, on cardio-respiratory function, compared to the standard challenge. Methods: a novel simulator was designed to represent the vibrations felt in <b>a</b> <b>rear</b> <b>facing</b> car seat during a normal urban cycle. 40 term & preterm babies, ready for discharge after birth, were recruited. The babies were their own control. Observations of heart & respiratory rates, saturation & end tidal CO 2 levels were recorded flat in a cot, static in the seat (30 °) & simulator (40 °) & during vibration (motion). Results: 19 term & 21 preterm infants were tested; 22 were male (55 %). Gestation range was 25 + 2 weeks to 41 + 5 weeks (median 35 + 5). Median birthweight was 2. 5 kg (range 0. 8 kg to 4. 8 kg). Age at testing was 1 to 65 days (median 13 days). There were no significant differences in outcome variables for infants in the cot & 30 ° position. However, compared to rest, in the static 40 ° position infants had significantly faster heartbeats, lower oxygen saturation & higher respiratory rates. When in motion these differences persisted & the number of desaturations below 85 % were significantly higher. Conclusions: testing all infants at 30 ° would suggest they could travel. However both term & preterm babies showed signs of cardio-respiratory distress in the 40 ° position with a significant increase in profound desaturations during motion, which were underestimated by the standard challeng...|$|R

The modification to the mirror consisted of a series of extensions to the mirror rim, to see if this method would attenuate the fluctuating base pressures. It was found that increasing the length of the extension changed the pressure pattern across the face, and the over all magnitude of the fluctuations reduced with increasing length of extension.
