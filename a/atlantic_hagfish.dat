50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish</b> {{may grow}} up to 2.5 ft long, with no eyes and no jaws; its star-shaped mouth is {{surrounded}} by 6 barbels. There is a single gill slit {{on each side of}} the eel-like body. It has a total of 88-102 pores from which it can exude a slimy mucus.|$|E
40|$|An {{exploratory}} <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish</b> (Myxine glutinosa) {{survey was}} conducted on the southwest slope of the Newfoundland Grand Bank during autumn 2002 to collect samples for a biological resource assessment and investigate the selective properties of baited 227 -litre traps with 12. 7, 13. 5, and 14. 3 mm (1 / 2 ", 17 / 32 ", and 9 / 16 ") diameter escape holes. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish</b> were found to exhibit a juvenile hermaphroditic stage. Female <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish</b> exhibited a total length (TL) at first, 50 %, and 100 % sexual maturity of 354, 378, and 440 mm, respectively. The testis was small and rudimen-tary showing no sign of maturation in the form of enlarged lobules in 350 hagfish examined within a size range of 195 – 638 mm TL. Each sexually mature female possessed a single clutch of developing ovoid eggs of similar size and 28 % possessed both developing and degenerating eggs. Degenerating eggs were limited to the early stage of the reproductive cycle among females with developing eggs that were < 12 mm in length. Examination of females with large (≥ 14 mm) eggs revealed a positive correlation (r 2 = 0. 61) between fecundity and total body length, however, the reproductive potential was low (11 – 38 eggs per female).

40|$|SYNOPSIS. This review briefly {{summarizes}} the latest findings on reproductive endocrinology of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish</b> (Myxine glutinosa) {{and implications for}} fisheries management. In response to a major decline or collapse of the fisheries (groundfish and anadromous species) industry in the Northeast, species that were once considered alternative or underutilized have and are being identified that may be suitable for com-mercial harvest, one such example is the hagfish. Hagfish {{in recent years have}} been sought after as valuable fish not only for their flesh, but also their skin. Currently, there are no regulations governing the harvesting of hagfish along the East Coast. There has been little to no information of the life history of hagfish including growth rate, age determination, reproductive biology, life span, and larval size at hatching. Thus, the level at which a sustainable fisheries for this species can be maintained is unknown. In some parts of the world, hagfish stocks are being depleted due to overfishing. In order for fisheries management to manage its hagfish stocks and develop a sustainable commercial hagfish fishery, critical information is needed to assist in determining the optimal use of this valuable resource. Key elements of the reproductive system have not been elucidated in hagfish. However, there is new evidence from recent reproductive studies that <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish</b> may have a seasonal reproductive cycle. These data include seasonal changes in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), gonadal steroids, estradiol and progesterone, corresponding to gonadal reproductive stages along with the putative identity of a func-tional corpus luteum. This newly acquired data may provide important information to fisheries managers of the East Coast...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The insulin {{from the}} <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish</b> (Myxine glutinosa) {{has been one}} of the most studied insulins from both a {{structural}} and a biological viewpoint; however, some aspects of its biology remain controversial, and there has been no satisfying structural explanation for its low biological potency. We have re-examined the receptor binding kinetics, as well as the metabolic and mitogenic properties, of this phylogenetically ancient insulin, as well as that from another extant representative of the ancient chordates, the river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis). Both insulins share unusual binding kinetics and biological properties with insulin analogues that have single mutations at residues that contribute to the hexamerization surface. We propose and demonstrate by reciprocal amino acid substitutions between hagfish and human insulins that the reduced biological activity of hagfish insulin results from unfavorable substitutions, namely, A 10 (Ile to Arg), B 4 (Gl...|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} low substrate (< 1 nM) {{thyroid hormone}} (TH) deiodination activities in liver, muscle, intestine, and brain microsomes of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish</b> fasted for 2 weeks and found extremely low thyroxine (T- 4) outer-ring deiodination (T 4 ORD) and inner-ring deiodination (T 4 IRD) {{as well as}} 3, 5, 3 &# 39;-triiodothyronine (T- 3) IRD activities. T 3 ORD, 3 &# 39;, 5 &# 39;-triiodothyronine (rT(3)) ORD and rT(3) IRD activities were undetectable. Hagfish deiodinating pathways resembled those of teleosts in requiring a thiol cofactor (dithiothreitol, DTT) and in their inhibition by established deiodinase inhibitors and by TH analogues. However, under optimal pH and DTT conditions intestinal T 4 ORD activity exceeded that of liver about 10 -fold. This contrasts with the situation in teleosts but resembles that reported recently in larval and adult lampreys, suggesting the intestine as a primary site of TH deiodination in lower craniates.

40|$|International audienceThe {{characteristic}} {{biology and}} wide distribution of hagfish species makes them relevant {{for use in}} pollution biomonitoring at great water depths, particularly in regions where deep-water oil exploration may take place. The exposure of fish to petrogenic contaminants can normally be detected from the level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites in bile fluid. Some of these metabolites are strong fluorophores, allowing analytical detection by means of simple fluorometric techniques such as fixed wavelength fluorescence (FF) and synchronous fluorescence scanning (SFS). In the present study bile from <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish</b> () collected in pristine areas (Barents Sea and southwestern Norway) displayed strong bile fluorescence levels, suggesting the presence of PAH contaminants. However, gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses ruled out PAHs as the origin for this fluorescence signal. Rather, the bile of contains components resulting in unusually strong background fluorescence interfering at the wavelength pairs used for detection of PAH metabolites. Possible background for the observed matrix interference and implications for detection of PAH metabolites in hagfish is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Using {{a highly}} {{sensitive}} fluorimetric assay, significant levels of angiotensin I -converting enzyme-like activity (ACELA) were detected {{in a range}} of tissues (branchial heart, gill, kidney with associated vasculature and archinephric duct, liver, whole brain and gut) from the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish</b> (Myxine glutinosa). The highest ACELA occurred in heart and gill (1. 8 and 1. 5 nmol His–Leu min− 1 mg protein− 1, respectively). The mammalian angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, at 10 − 5 M was a potent inhibitor of the ACELA found in all hagfish tissues. Radioimmunoassay showed that immunoreactive angiotensins (251. 8 ± 11. 8 pM) were detectable in hagfish plasma. The validity of the assay for measurement of hagfish angiotensins was indicated by the parallelism of the angiotensin II standard curve against serially diluted hagfish plasma. Measurement of immunoreactive plasma angiotensins and detection of significant levels of ACELA {{in a wide range of}} tissues gives indirect evidence for the presence of a renin–angiotensin system in hagfishes, the earliest evolved group of craniate...|$|E
40|$|The cathelicidin {{family of}} host defence {{peptides}} {{is regarded as}} {{an important component of}} the host innate immune system. Its members have been found in mammals, birds, primitive vertebrate <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish</b> and, most recently, also in ray-finned fish such as rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon. By using genomic PCR amplifications and RT-PCR tissue analyses we have here investigated and characterized the cathelicidin genefamily in three salmonids: brown trout (Salmo trutta fario), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and grayling (Thymallus thymallus). One or two different genes were found in each species coding for almost identical cathelin-like domains and largely varied cationic C-terminal regions. Multiple alignment of the amino acid sequences let us recognize two distinctive hallmarks of these peptides: the presence of a high number of serine and glycine residues, which may collocate them in a new class of antimicrobial peptides, and of the six-amino-acid repeated sequence RPGGGS detected in a variable number of copies among different cathelicidins. The high variation in length and sequence of this region suggests the existence of a genetically unstable region similar to that found in some mammalian cathelicidins...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} in vivoand in situexperiments were {{performed}} on the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish</b> (Myxine glutinosa) (i) to characterize the levels of circulating catecholamines during acute stresses, including hypoxia, anoxia or physical disturbance (air-exposure), and (ii) to evaluate the potential mechanisms of catecholamine release from the major sites of storage, the systemic heart and posterior cardinal vein (PCV). Adrenaline and noradrenaline were stored at roughly equivalent concentrations (approximately 20 mgg 21) in cardiac tissue, whereas noradrenaline was the predominant catecholamine stored in the PCV (approximately 50 mgg 21). The heart stored larger quantities of total catecholamines than did the PCV (approximately three times greater) owing to its larger mass and higher concentration of adrenaline. Exposure of chronically cannulated hagfish to acute hypoxia [mean water PO (PwO) = 1. 4 kPa; 10. 5 mmHg) for 30 min caused {{a significant decrease in}} arterial PO (from 11. 5 ± 1. 3 kPa to 1. 2 ± 0. 3 kPa) and arterial O 2 content (from 3. 9 ± 0. 3 ml 100 ml 21 to 0. 9 ± 0. 2 ml 100 ml 21).

40|$|Sodium/proton {{exchangers}} (NHE) are transmembrane {{proteins that}} facilitate {{the exchange of}} a Na + ion for a H + ion across cellular membranes. The NHE {{are present in the}} gills of fishes and are believed to function in acid-base regulation by driving the extrusion of protons across the branchial epithelium in exchange for Na + in the water. In this study, we have used reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the presence of a branchial NHE in the gills of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish,</b> Myxine glutinosa. The subsequent partial cDNA sequence shares homology with other vertebrate and invertebrate NHE isoforms. In addition, using semi-quantitative, multiplex RT-PCR we demonstrate that mRNA expression of hagfish gill NHE is upregulated following an induced metabolic acidosis. Expression was increased to 4. 4 times basal levels at 2 -h post-infusion and had decreased to 1. 6 times basal by 6 h. Expression had returned to basal levels by 24 -h post-infusion. The inference from this study is that a gill NHE which is potentially important in acid-base regulation has been present in the vertebrate lineage since before the divergence of the hagfishes from the main vertebrate line. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The stable {{metabolite}} of {{nitric oxide}} in plasma is NOx, {{the sum of}} nitrite plus nitrate. Measures of plasma NOx may provide information about the nitric oxide tonus of the entire endothelium including capillary microvessels. Although data are available for mammalian species, plasma NOx measurements in early vertebrate species are scarce. The {{purpose of this study}} was to test the hypothesis that plasma NOx would be similar to the NOx in the water environment for fish in early classes (Agnatha and Chondrichthye) and would exceed water NOx levels in the known nitrite-sensitive fish (Osteichthye). Plasma samples were obtained from 18 species of adult fish (n = 167) and from their housing or natural water environment. NOx was measured by using chemiluminescence. Plasma NOx was detected in all species and ranged from 0. 5 nmol/ml (skate) to 453. 9 nmol/ml (shortnose gar). Average plasma NOx was significantly higher in sea lamprey than in <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish</b> whereas that of little skate was 3 -fold lower than in spiny dogfish shark. Plasma NOx differed significantly among early bony fish (paddlefish, pallid sturgeon, gar) yet was similar among modern bony fish, with the exception of rainbow trout. Plasma NOx reflected water NOx in only 2 species (hagfish and shark), and levels did not coincide with nitrite sensitivity. This study provides an expanded comparative view of plasma NOx levels across 3 groups of early fish. The data obtained suggest a nitric oxide system in early and modern fish...|$|E
40|$|Light and {{electron}} microscopic {{observations and}} biochemical {{analysis of the}} lingual cartilages from the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish,</b> Myxine glutinosa, reveal {{two different types of}} cartilage, designated types 1 and 2, respectively. The anterior and medial lingual are type 1, while the posterior lingual cartilage is type 2. Chondrocytes in type 1 cartilage are similar to those found in other vertebrate cartilages. The presence within the Golgi elements of material that resembles a component of the extracellular matrix suggests the involvement of active chondrocytes in the synthesis of the matrix. The matrix of the type 1 cartilage contains fibrils arranged to form concentric lamellae in the territorial matrix and irregularly arranged, branched fibrils in the interterritorial matrix. Biochemical analysis of the type 1 cartilage reveals that it is composed primarily of a cyanogen bromide (CNBr) -insoluble protein of unique composition that we have termed " myxinin. " Myxinin appears to be similar, but not identical, to lamprin. Type 2 cartilage bears no resemblance to any other known vertebrate cartilage. The principal cells are hypertrophied and are characterized by masses of cytoplasmic filaments. The appearance of the organelles in smaller nest cells suggests that nest cells are active in the production of some of the matrix, which consists primarily of collagen. Microfibrils and a basal lamina-like material are also present. Biochemical analysis of the type 2 cartilage reveals that the CNBr-insoluble material is different from myxinin. Comparisons of lamprey and hagfish cartilages prompt the concept that these two agnathans probably followed long-independent evolutionary histories...|$|E
40|$|Light and {{electron}} microscopy and in vitro inflation experiments {{were conducted on}} the aortae of three different invertebrate species: the lobster Homarus americanus, the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus and the whelk Busycon contrarium. Inflation experiments were also performed on the aortae of two species of primitive vertebrates, the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus and the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish</b> Myxine glutinosa. The inflation experiments demonstrated similar overall biomechanical properties in each case, despite the existence of differences in tissue structure. The vessels were compliant at low strains, but demonstrated nonlinear elasticity, increasing in stiffness as strains increased; this property could act as protection against artery wall rupture. The vessels of the lamprey, hagfish and lobster are capable of acting as fairly efficient elastic reservoirs and of smoothing blood flow during circulation as they had low hysteresis values (13 - 18 %). The aortae of the horseshoe crab and whelk, if performing this function, have much higher energy losses, {{up to more than}} 30 % per cycle. The microscopy studies of the aortae of the lobster, horseshoe crab and whelk revealed tissue structures which differ widely from each other {{as well as from the}} structures of the lamprey and hagfish. None of these arteries contained elastin, but all contained fibrillar material which differed in appearance, size and arrangement between species.

40|$|Endozepines are {{a family}} of {{peptides}} capable of displacing benzodiazepines from their specific binding sites, to which belong the diazepam-binding inhibitor and the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN). This paper reports the distribution of ODN-related peptides, investigated {{for the first time}} by immunocytochemistry, in different brain and pituitary regions of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish,</b> Myxine glutinosa. Immunoreactive ODN-like material was found in the telencephalon at the level of bundles of different olfactory nerve fibres. Moreover, {{at the level of the}} pallium, immunoreactive multipolar neurons were observed in the pars parvocellularis of the stratum griseum superficialis. Similar immunopositive nerve cell bodies were found in the nucleus medialis of the central prosencephalic complex. In the mesencephalon, few immunoreactive neurons lining and contacting the mesencephalic ventricle were detected; such nerve cells could be involved in the regulation of cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis. Dorsally in the mesencephalon, numerous ODN-containing cell bodies were present in the area praetectalis. The rhomboencephalon was immunostained only in the octavolateral area and in the nucleus motorius magnocellularis of the trigeminal nerve. Furthermore, ODN immunoreactivity was also present in the nerve cells of ganglia of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve complex. The immunocytochemical patterns described here in the brain of M. glutinosa suggest an involvement of ODN-like peptides as neuromodulators in sensory pathways, such as olfactory and visual. Finally, ODN-like substances were localized in discrete populations of adenohypophysial cells and in tanycytes lining the neurohypophyseal walls, suggesting for endozepines a paracrine and/or endocrine control of pituitary hormones release and a neurohormone role respectively. These results could give new insights into the chemioarchitecture of the brain of myxinoids...|$|E
30|$|In this study, the peptide {{previously}} {{isolated from}} coelomocyte (blood cell) extracts {{of the green}} sea urchin, S. droebachiensis, centrocin 1 heavy chain (CEN 1 HC-Br) (Li et al. 2010) and the variants thereof, were evaluated for the potential as novel anti-infectious agents by measuring their antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effect in vitro. CEN 1 HC-Br contains a brominated tryptophan in position two in the amino acid sequence (Li et al. 2010) with unknown function. AMPs containing brominated tryptophan have previously been characterized from several marine organisms such as hagfish intestinal antimicrobial peptides (HFIAPs), isolated from <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish</b> or styelin D, isolated from tunicate Styela clava (Taylor et al. 2000; Uzzell et al. 2003). It has been speculated that the unusual amino acid bromotryptophan makes these AMPs less susceptible to proteolytic degradation and may increase the biological activity of the peptide (Li et al. 2010). To elucidate the functional significance of the bromination of the tryptophan residue, the debrominated variant of the centrocin 1 heavy chain, i.e. CEN 1 HC, {{was included in the}} assessments. To map the peptide region necessary of the biological activity, the C-terminal truncated variants of both peptides, CEN 1 HC-Br (1 – 20) and CEN 1 HC (1 – 20), were also tested. A free cysteine residue in the peptide sequence may potentially complicate the product development process due to the possible heterogeneity of the product caused by formation of disulphide bonds between molecules. Therefore, we investigated if the cysteine residue in CEN 1 HC (position 25) could be replaced by a similar amino acid. The most commonly used replacement for cysteine is serine, which in terms of geometry and volume occupancy is a highly isosteric analogue of cysteine. A cysteine to serine modified variant of CEN 1 HC, CEN 1 HC (Ser), was compared for microbicidal and anti-inflammatory properties to its non-substituted equivalent.|$|E
40|$|Hagfish are marine {{chordates}} that, despite lacking jaws, {{are able}} to feed on large, tough carcasses with the protraction and forceful retraction of toothplates. Using muscle stimulation experiments, we studied {{the function of the}} feeding apparatus muscles in the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, and compared our results with muscle activity patterns recorded from previously studied <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish</b> Myxine glutinosa. Most of our efforts addressed function in the four major feeding apparatus muscles (the deep protractor, sphincter, perpendicular, and retractor muscles), and our stimulations of superficial musculature (superficial protractor muscles and rectus muscles) were assessed qualitatively. Stimulation experiments (tetanic contractions stimulated at 80 V, 60 Hz, 1 ms duration) were performed on in situ and excised feeding apparatuses from five animals positioned supine, while toothplate movements and muscle shape changes (strain) were analyzed from video recordings at 120 Hz. Our results confirm previous observations of M. glutinosa; in E. stoutii, the deep protractor muscles induce toothplate protraction, while activity in the retractor, sphincter, and perpendicular muscles power retraction of the toothplates. In both species, toothplate protraction causes the cylindrical feeding apparatus to decrease in length and increase in diameter, and vice versa during retraction. Upon excision from the body, the feeding apparatus in E. stoutii undergoes greater proportional length changes but smaller changes in width, suggesting that the soft tissue connections to the body wall impose constraints on muscle displacement. Because it comprises {{a large part of the}} head region (anterior 20 % of total length), constraining the cylindrical shape of the feeding apparatus should work in retaining the cylindrical shape of the head while impeding unwanted head deformations in situations where the head must fit and maneuver in tight spaces (e. g. knotting and burrowing behaviors) ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish,</b> Myxlne. glutinosa,is {{the most}} {{primitive}} vertebrate extant, and it diverged {{from the main}} vertebrate evolutionary chain some 500 mi 11 ion years ago. The primary sequence of hagfish insulin shows that it contains the residues implemented for expression of activity and the residues stabi­lizing the insulin monomer and dimer, but not the hexamer. The primary sequence of hagfish preproinsulin, deduced from the mRNA-cDNA sequence shows little homology in sequence of the precursor parts of the molecule. However, the sequence contains the structural requirements for the tenta­tive functions, jL. z. vectorial discharge of the prohormone and a minimum over-all size of the precursor. The proinsulin converting enzyme(s) {{seems to have a}} specificity similar to that of all other vertebrates studied. The tertiary structure of hagfish insulin in the crystal is almost super­imposable on pig insulin's structure. The biological  activity of hagfish insulin is 5 %   of that  of piginsulin and its receptor binding affinity   is 23 % in isolated   rat fat  cells. Hagfish insulin was the first partial insulin antagonist on the rat fat cell insulin receptor. The change(s) in structure responsible for the reduction of acti­vity and binding are not known. Biosynthesis of hagfish insulin, In vXJyto, follows the pattern observed in higher vertebrates, although at a much slower rate. Unlike the situation in mammals, hagfish insulin biosynthesis is not stimulated by glucose. A radioimmunoassay for hagfish insulin was developed and the antiserum cross-reacted with       bovine insulin to only 0. 01 %. Theassay was used to study insulin release in vitro. Glucose  stimulates insulin release but, unlike the situation in higher vertebrates, amino acids do not. In vivo, hagfish insulin stimulated the incorporation of 14 C-glucose and 14 C-leucine into hagfish skeletal muscle glycogen and protein. The observed similari ties,between hagfish and higher vertebrates,with regards to insulin's structure, biosynthesis, release, receptor binding, and biological activity support the conclusion that, insulin and its processing and effector machineries were structurally and biologically well defined some 500 million years ago.

40|$|To provide {{advice to}} {{fisheries}} managers, scientists study both commercially valuable species and species of ecological importance {{in order to}} learn their habits, biology, population dynamics, and ecological role. This data is then processed and interpreted and passed onto managers who use this information to establish yearly catch limits for commercial species. Historically, the large scale commercial fisheries in Newfoundland and Labrador have been based on species that have exhibited high abundance and low biomass. However, as the numbers of commercially valuable fish species continue to decline, harvesters are turning to species that are less abundant and of less commercial value in order to maximise the value of their annual income. In this context, less economic value would be a result of a low price per weight of species harvested, or a high price per weight, but low numbers of species actually harvested. In Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) employs highly skilled and well educated scientists to study the biomass and abundance or formally abundant commercially valuable fishery species, but very few of these researchers are familiar with many of the less commercially valuable species. In {{order to be able to}} set responsible catch limits for these newly harvested species, the DFO must either hire more biologists who are familiar with these species, or develop methodologies which will provide them with the scientific data they require to ensure a sustainable harvest. This will require an integrated management approach, where harvesters will have a means to provide DFO with the data required for a sustainable management plan. [...] The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that traditional ecological knowledge of fish harvesters should continue to be integrated with conventional fisheries research data in the importance of industry involvement during data collection. The resulting information could then be used to help determine if new and emerging fish species of less economic value can sustain a commercially viable fishery.

40|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) -contacting neurons are sensory-type cells sending ciliated {{dendritic}} process {{into the}} CSF. Some of the prosencephalic CSF-contacting neurons of higher vertebrates were postulated to be chemoreceptors detecting the chemical {{composition of the}} CSF, other cells may percieve light as „deep encephalic photoreceptors". In our earlier works, CSF-contacting neurons of the mechanoreceptor-type were described around the central canal of the hagfish spinal cord. It was supposed that perceieving {{the flow of the}} CSF they are involved in vasoregulatory mechanisms of the nervous tissue. In the present work, we examined the brain ventricular system of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>hagfish</b> with special reference to the presence and fine structure of CSF-contacting neurons. Myxinoids have an ontogenetically reduced brain ventricular system. In the adult hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) the lumen of the lateral ventricle is closed, the third ventricle has a preoptic-, infundibular and subhabenular part that are not connected to each other. The choroid plexus is absent. The infundibular part of the third ventricle has a medial hypophyseal recess and, more caudally, a paired lateral recess. We found CSF-contacting neurons in {{the lower part of the}} third ventricle, in the preoptic and infundibular recess as well as in the lateral infundibular recesses. No CSF-contacting neurons were found in the cerebral aqueduct connecting the subhabenular recess to the fourth ventricle. There is a pineal recess and a well-developed subcommissural organ at the rostral end of the aqueduct. Extending from the caudal part of the fourth ventricle in the medulla to the caudal end of the spinal cord, the central canal has a dorsal and ventral part. Dendrites of CSF-contacting neurons are protruding into the ventral lumen. Corroborating the supposed choroid plexus-like function of the wall of the dorsal central canal, segmental vessels reach a thin area on both sides of the ependymal lining. The perikarya of the CSF-contacting neurons found in the brain ventricles are mainly bipolar and contain granular vesicles of various size. The bulb-like terminal of their ventricular dendrites bears several stereocilia and contains basal bodies as well as mitochondria. Basal bodies emit cilia of the 9 + 0 -type. Cilia may arise from the basal body and acessory basal body as well. The axons run ependymofugally and enter - partially cross - the periventricular synaptic zones. No neurohemal terminals similar to those formed by spinal CSF-contacting neurons of higher vertebrates have been found in the hagfish. We suppose that CSF-contacting neurons transform CSF-mediated non-synaptic information taken up by their ventricular dendrites to synaptic one. A light-sensitive role for some (preoptic) groups of CSF-contacting neurons cannot be excluded...|$|E
