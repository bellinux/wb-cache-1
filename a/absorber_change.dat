40|$|Dielectric {{optical waveguides}} exhibit {{properties}} {{that are well}} suited to sensor applications. They have low refractive index and are transparent {{to a wide range}} of wavelengths. They can react with the surrounding environment in a variety of controllable ways. In certain sensor applications, it is advantageous to integrate the dielectric waveguide on a semiconductor substrate with active devices. In this work, we demonstrate a tamper sensor based on dielectric waveguides that connect epitaxial GaAs-GaAlAs sources and detectors. The tamper sensing function is realized by attaching particles of absorbing material with high refractive index to the surface of the waveguides. These absorbers are then attached to a lid or cover, as in an integrated circuit package or multi-chip module. The absorbers attenuate the light in the waveguides as a function of absorber interaction. In the tamper indicating mode, the absorbers are placed randomly on the waveguides, to form a unique attenuation pattern that is registered by the relative signal levels on the photodetectors. When the lid is moved, the pattern of <b>absorbers</b> <b>changes,</b> altering the photodetector signals. This dielectric waveguide arrangement is applicable to a variety of sensor functions, and specifically can be fabricated as a chemical sensor by the application of cladding layers that change their refractive index and/or optical absorption properties upon exposure to selected chemical species. An example is found in palladium claddings that are sensitive to hydrogen.

40|$|We use a halo {{occupation}} {{approach to}} connect Mg II absorbers to dark matter halos {{as a function}} of redshift. Using the model constructed in Tinker & Chen (2008), we parameterize the conditional probability of an absorber of equivalent width Wr being produced by a halo of mass Mh at a given redshift, P(Wr|Mh,z). We constrain the free parameters of the model by matching the observed statistics of Mg II absorbers: the frequency function f (Wr), the redshift evolution n(z), and the clustering bias bW. The redshift evolution of Wr ≥ 1 absorbers increases from z = 0. 4 to z = 2, while the total halo cross section decreases monotonically with redshift. This discrepancy can only be explained if the gaseous halos evolve with respect to their host halos. We make predictions for the clustering bias of absorbers {{as a function of}} redshift under different evolutionary scenarios, eg, the gas cross section per halo evolves or the halo mass scale of <b>absorbers</b> <b>changes.</b> We demonstrate that the relative contribution of these scenarios may be constrained by measurements of absorber clustering at z � 1 and z ∼ 0. 1. If we further assume a redshift-independent mass scale for efficient shock heating of halo gas of Mcrit = 10 11. 5 h − 1 M⊙, absorber evolution is predominantly caused by a changing halo mass scale of absorbers. Our model predicts that strong absorbers always arise in ∼ Mcrit halos, independent of redshift, but the mass scale of weak absorbers decreases by 2 dex from 0 < z < 2. Thus, the measured anti-correlation of clustering bias and Wr should flatten by z ∼ 1. 5.

40|$|Impulsive loadings, or {{repetitive}} brief impacts, {{produced by}} machines and mechanisms of the shock action, are widely {{spread in the}} engineering practice. In many cases, trustworthy results of their dynamic analyses {{can be obtained by}} taking account of the shape and duration of their impulses. In the paper, the periodic mode of the system motion and the parameters of the impact absorber applicable to one-sided periodic impulses of rectangular form are examined. The structure to be protected and the absorber are simulated as a system of a single collision of masses. The impacts are accepted to be instantaneous and taken into account by means of the coefficient of restitution. The damping properties of the protected structure and the absorber are considered {{on the basis of the}} viscid friction hypothesis; therefore, the damping properties of the whole system are disproportionate. The relations identified in the course of the research are used to find the impulse frequency characteristics (IFC) of the protected structure to identify the absorber parameters. The affect of duration of external impulses produced onto the IFC, characterized by the drastic increase in the amplitudes as compared to that in the case of a single impulse of the same magnitude, is the subject of research. It is proven that the maximal ordinates of IFC decrease slightly against the increase in the duration of external impulses; therefore, the efficiency of the impact <b>absorber</b> <b>changes</b> insignificantly, and it is equivalent to that of a dynamic absorber. It is noteworthy that if the duration of external impulses is under 10 % of the duration of the period, they may be replaced by instantaneous impulses.

Similarly, a dynamic vibration absorber is {{proved to be a}} very simple and effective vibration suppression device, with many practical implementations in civil and mechani-cal engineering. This paper analyzes the prospect of using a vibration absorber for pos-sible energy harvesting. To achieve this goal, a vibration absorber is supplemented with a piezoelectric stack for both vibration confinement and energy harvesting. It is assumed that the original structure is sensitive to vibrations and that the absorber is the element where the vibration energy is confined, which in turn is harvested by means of a piezo-electric stack. The primary goal is to control the vibration of the host structure and the secondary goal is to harvest energy out of the dynamic vibration absorber at the same time. Approximate fixed-point theory is used to find a closed form expression for optimal frequency ratio of the vibration <b>absorber.</b> The <b>changes</b> in the optimal parameters of the vibration absorber due to the addition of the energy harvesting electrical circuit are derived.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a process for}} performing preclosure criticality analyses for a repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. These analyses will be performed {{from the time of}} receipt of fissile material until permanent closure of the repository (preclosure period). The process describes how criticality safety analyses will be performed for various configurations of waste in or out of waste packages that could occur during preclosure as a result of normal operations or event sequences. The criticality safety analysis considers those event sequences resulting in unanticipated moderation, loss of neutron <b>absorber,</b> geometric <b>changes,</b> or administrative errors in waste form placement (loading) of the waste package. The report proposes a criticality analyses process for preclosure to allow a consistent transition from preclosure to postclosure, thereby possibly reducing potential cost increases and delays in licensing of Yucca Mountain. The proposed approach provides the advantage of using a parallel regulatory framework for evaluation of preclosure and postclosure performance and is consistent with the U. S.

40|$|In the {{engineering}} of complex systems, changes to flight hardware or software after initial release can have large impacts on project implementation. Even a comparatively small change on an assembly or subsystem can cascade into {{a significant amount}} of rework if it propagates through the system. This can happen when a change affects the interfaces with another subsystem, or if it alters the emergent behavior of the system in a significant way, and is especially critical when subsequent work has already been performed utilizing the initial version. These changes can be driven by new or modified requirements leading to changes in scope, design deficiencies discovered during analysis or test, failures during test, and other such mechanisms. In complex system development, changes are managed through engineering change requests (ECRs) that are communicated to affected elements. While the tracking of changes is critical for the ongoing engineering of a complex project, the ECRs can also reveal trends on the system level that could assist with the management of current and future projects. In an effort to identify systematic trends, this research has analyzed ECRs from two different JPL led space mission projects to classify the change activity and assess change propagation. It employs time analysis of ECR initiation throughout the lifecycle, correlates ECR generators with ECR absorbers, and considers the distribution of ECRs across subsystems. The analyzed projects are the planetary rover mission, Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), and the Earth-orbiting mission, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP). This analysis has shown that there is some consistency across these projects with regard to which subsystems generate or absorb change. The relationship of the ECRSubsystem networks identifies subsystems that are <b>absorbers</b> of <b>change</b> and others that are generators of change. For the flight systems, the strongest <b>absorbers</b> of <b>change</b> were found to be avionics and the mechanical structure for the spacecraft bus, and the strongest generators of change were concentrated in the payloads. When this attribute is recognized, project management can attempt to close ECR networks by looking for ways to leverage absorbers and avoid multipliers. Alternatively, in cases where changes to a subsystem are undesirable, knowing whether it is an absorber can greatly assist with expectations and planning. This analysis identified some {{significant differences between the two}} projects as well. While SMAP followed a relatively well behaved blossom profile across the project, MSL had an avalanche of change leading to the drastic action of re-baselining the launch date. While the official reasoning for the slip of the launch date is based in technical difficulties, the avalanche profile implies that a snowballing of change may have had a significant impact as well. Furthermore, the complexity metrics applied show that MSL has a more complex nature than SMAP, with 269 ECRs in 65 Parent-Child clusters, opposed to 166 in 53 for SMAP, respectively. The Process Complexity metric confirms this, quantitatively measuring the complexity of MSL at 492, compared to 367 for SMAP. These tools and metrics confirm the intuition that MSL, as a planetary rover, is a more complex space mission than SMAP, an earth orbiter. by Eric D. Ward. Thesis: S.

The findings indicate that multiple jobholding acts as a short-term shock <b>absorber</b> to cyclical <b>changes.</b> However, in the long-term, these effects dissipate, indicating that moonlighting plays a similar role as do changes in unemployment and labor-force participation to regional labor market shocks. Conversely, multiple jobholding rates are inversely related to average weekly earnings. Thus, job growth accompanied by real wage (and productivity) growth {{may result in a}} decline in multiple jobholding, further exacerbating potential labor shortages. Other key factors found to influence multiple jobholding include occupational structure and education. Copyright 2002 Gatton College of Business and Economics, University of Kentucky. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, self-sensing {{technology}} was introduced into an adaptive tuned vibration absorber, incorporating a laminated magnetorheological elastomer (MRE) structure, a hybrid magnetic {{system and a}} self-sensing component. The adoption of the laminated MRE structure and the hybrid magnetic system enables the absorber to have higher lateral flexibility and a wider effective frequency range. The integration of the self-sensing capability allows the absorber to operate without sensors and, at the same time, greatly reduces costs, required space and maintenance. A series of experiments were conducted to measure the frequency shift property, to verify the self-sensing capability and to evaluate its effectiveness on vibration reduction. The experimental {{results show that the}} natural frequency of the proposed <b>absorber</b> can be <b>changed</b> to 4. 8 Hz at - 3 A and 11. 3 Hz at 3 A from 8. 5 Hz at 0 A, the frequency of the self-sensed voltage equals the excitation frequency and, more importantly, the vibration control effectiveness of the self-sensing MRE absorber is experimentally verified and it is more effective on vibration reduction than a passive absorber...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} taking {{credit for the}} {{reduction}} in reactivity of burned or spent nuclear fuel (SNF) due to fuel burnup is {{commonly referred to as}} burnup credit. The reduction in reactivity that occurs with fuel burnup is due to the net reduction of fissile nuclide concentrations and the production of actinide and fission-product neutron <b>absorbers.</b> The <b>change</b> in the inventory of these nuclides with fuel burnup, and the consequent reduction in reactivity, is dependent upon the depletion environment. Therefore, the use of burnup credit necessitates consideration of all possible fuel operating conditions, including the use of integral burnable absorbers (IBAs). The Interim Staff Guidance on burnup credit [1] issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) Spent Fuel Project Office recommends licensees restrict the use of burnup credit to assemblies that have not used burnable absorbers (e. g., IBAs or burnable poison rods, BPRs). This restriction eliminates {{a large portion of the}} currently discharged spent fuel assemblies from cask loading, and thus severely limits the practical usefulness of burnup credit. The reason for this restriction is that the presence of burnable absorbers during depletion hardens the neutron spectrum, resulting in lower {sup 235 }U depletion and higher production of fissile plutonium isotopes. Enhanced plutonium production has the effect of increasing the reactivity of the fuel at discharge and beyond. Consequently, an assembly exposed to burnable absorbers may have a slightly higher reactivity for a given burnup than an assembly that has not been exposed to burnable absorbers. This paper examines the effect of IBAs on reactivity for various designs and enrichment/poison loading combinations as a function of burnup. The effect of BPRs, which are typically removed during operation, is addressed elsewhere [2]...|$|R
40|$|Abridged) Our deep multiwavelength {{campaign}} on NGC 5548 revealed an unusually strong X-ray obscuration. The resulting dramatic decrease in incident ionizing flux {{allowed us to}} construct a comprehensive physical, spatial and temporal picture for the long-studied AGN wind in this object. Here we analyze the UV spectra of the outflow acquired during the campaign {{as well as from}} four previous epochs. We find that a simple model based on a fixed total column-density <b>absorber,</b> reacting to <b>changes</b> in ionizing illumination, matches the very different ionization states seen in five spectroscopic epochs spanning 16 years. Absorption troughs from C III* appeared for the first time during our campaign. From these troughs, we infer that the main outflow component is situated at 3. 5 +- 1 pc from the central source. Three other components are situated between 5 - 70 pc and two are further than 100 pc. The wealth of observational constraints and the disparate relationship of the observed X-ray and UV flux between different epochs make our physical model a leading contender for interpreting trough variability data of quasar outflows.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} control {{design of a}} {{semi-active}} dynamic absorber for machine vibration damping. The dynamic absorber is a known instrument for undesirable vibration absorption. It is possible to obtain more universal and effective suppression of disturbing vibrations, if the dynamic <b>absorber</b> structure is <b>changed</b> in a specific way. It could be achieved by using some modern mechatronic elements with controllable damping value or stiffness. The properties of a controlled semi-active dynamic absorber on several different mechanical structures were examined in detail for the areas of lower and higher frequency. Two different methods of control synthesis for a semi-active absorber were designed. The efficiency and properties of the designed methods has been examined by using simulation models with respect to comparison of passive and active dynamic damper. The designed algorithms were successfully checked during a real experiment on a supported beam. A considerable correspondence between simulation and experiment was proved. New concept of fundamental active element utilization is introduced. A piezoactuator {{was used as an}} artificial semi-active element. This concept is suitable for suppression of high frequency/low deviation vibration instead of unavailable elements.

40|$|Ocean and sea waves {{contain a}} lot of unexploited energy. This energy can be absorbed by wave energy {{converters}} (WECs). Wave energy is a renewable energy type that {{is becoming more and}} more important. Several systems have been invented, among them point absorber systems which are wave energy converters consisting of small (floating) bodies oscillating with one or more degrees of freedom. They can either operate with respect to a fixed reference, or with respect to a floating reference. The latter principle has been adopted in a novel way in the wave energy converter that is studied in the SEEWEC project, where multiple point absorbers are combined in a floating, moored platform [Seewec web site]. The performance of such a heaving point absorber in a floating platform is analysed in a linear way. The boundary element method (BEM) package Wamit [Wamit manual] is used to determine the hydrodynamic behaviour of both the platform and the oscillating point absorbers. The equation of motion of the point absorber is solved, taking into account the Response Amplitude Operators (RAO) of the platform, calculated by Wamit. Different buoy geometries are evaluated to obtain the ideal values of size, draft and shape with regard to power absorption for different sea states. The natural frequency of the point <b>absorber</b> is <b>changed</b> by adding supplementary mass in order to tune the point absorber to the wave climate (Vantorre, Banasiak et al.). In waves characterized by Hs = 1 - 2 m, which have a high occurrence frequency on the Belgian Continental Shelf, a point absorber with a diameter of 4 m can absorb about 20 to 30 kW. Two different restrictions are applied to the heave motion of the point absorber. The first one is imposed by the limited stroke of the mechanical system connecting the point absorber to the platform; the second condition is required to decrease the probability of occurrence of slamming...|$|R
40|$|In general, {{solutions}} for standards {{to improve the}} vibration and noise problems is to redesign or modify the system such as increasing {{the thickness of the}} wall panels, enhancing the elasticity of the structure, and increase the damping mechanism of the structure. So in this study, the concept of Dynamic Vibration Absorbers (DVA) are used to reduce vibration or amplitude. On a Simply Supported Plate (SSP) structure, the method used in this study were of analytical equations and finite element analysis. MATLAB ® is used to solve the equations of analytical theory, as well as simulation results verify the ANSYS ®. The study found that the analytical and simulation equation for SSP are same. The frequency range used are 10 Hz to 500 Hz {{and there are a number}} of modes show. In addition, the mass and damping in the <b>absorber</b> is <b>changed.</b> It aims to identify the mass and damping are most suitable for use in absorber system. Once seen, the mass of 1. 0 kg more suitable for use as a percentage reduction or vibration amplitude is the highest of 40. 99 %. The damping values shows that the percentage reduction in the amplitude of the vibration or spring, 10 N / m is 44. 64 %. Further, this study was undertaken by placing the absorber at different locations configuration. This was followed by the addition of a single absorber and multiple absorber to see the average percentage reduction in vibration or amplitude. Overall global reduction of the four absorber is 68. 07 % compared to the single absorber only 33. 31 % reduction. Finally, it can be concluded that multiple vibration absorber can reduce the overall global vibration compared to a single absorber. However, for structures that take into account the weight of the main things to consider increasing the number of absorbers as excessive weight of the structure will result in a reduction in vehicle fuel efficiency, aerospace, automotive and machine systems...|$|R
