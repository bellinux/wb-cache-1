25|$|Soap pellets are {{combined}} with fragrances {{and other materials}} and blended to homogeneity in an amalgamator (mixer). The mass is then discharged from the mixer into a refiner, which, by means of <b>an</b> <b>auger,</b> forces the soap through a fine wire screen. From the refiner, the soap passes over a roller mill (French milling or hard milling) {{in a manner similar}} to calendering paper or plastic or to making chocolate liquor. The soap is then passed through one or more additional refiners to further plasticize the soap mass. Immediately before extrusion, the mass is passed through a vacuum chamber to remove any trapped air. It is then extruded into a long log or blank, cut to convenient lengths, passed through a metal detector, and then stamped into shape in refrigerated tools. The pressed bars are packaged in many ways.|$|E
25|$|Infinite helical symmetry: If {{there are}} no {{distinguishing}} features {{along the length of}} a helix or helix-like object, the object will have infinite symmetry much like that of a circle, but with the additional requirement of translation along the long axis of the object to return it to its original appearance. A helix-like object is one that has at every point the regular angle of coiling of a helix, but which can also have a cross section of indefinitely high complexity, provided only that precisely the same cross section exists (usually after a rotation) at every point {{along the length of the}} object. Simple examples include evenly coiled springs, slinkies, drill bits, and augers. Stated more precisely, an object has infinite helical symmetries if for any small rotation of the object around its central axis there exists a point nearby (the translation distance) on that axis at which the object will appear exactly as it did before. It is this infinite helical symmetry that gives rise to the curious illusion of movement along the length of <b>an</b> <b>auger</b> or screw bit that is being rotated. It also provides the mechanically useful ability of such devices to move materials along their length, provided that they are combined with a force such as gravity or friction that allows the materials to resist simply rotating along with the drill or auger.|$|E
500|$|Ice cores are {{collected}} by cutting around a cylinder {{of ice in}} a way that enables it to be brought to the surface. [...] Early cores were often collected with hand augers and they are still used for short holes. A design for ice core augers was patented in 1932 and they have changed little since. [...] <b>An</b> <b>auger</b> is essentially a cylinder with helical metal ribs (known as flights) wrapped around the outside, {{at the lower end of}} which are cutting blades. [...] Hand augers can be rotated by a T handle or a brace handle, and some can be attached to handheld electric drills to power the rotation. [...] With the aid of a tripod for lowering and raising the auger, cores up to 50m deep can be retrieved, but the practical limit is about 30m for engine-powered augers, and less for hand augers. [...] Below this depth, electromechanical or thermal drills are used.|$|E

500|$|Allen {{was the son}} of John and Sarah Allen. His {{father was}} a native of Connecticut and of English origin, and his mother was {{originally}} from Vermont and of Scottish descent. He left home when he was eight years old [...] "to carve out a fortune for himself", as Sylvester put it in his History of Rensselaer County, New York. He began work in <b>an</b> <b>auger</b> factory in Hamden, Connecticut, at an early age and continued until he was seventeen years old. At that time, he purchased a clock store, which he traded for horses in Vermont and Canada. He shipped his horses to the West Indies, but the ship was wrecked and his horses were lost, thus placing him badly in debt. However, he soon obtained credit, and again shipped a number of horses to the West Indies, this time successfully, enabling him to pay all his debts and even earning him a profit.|$|E
500|$|Black tea: The {{tea leaves}} {{are allowed to}} {{completely}} oxidize. Black tea is first withered to induce protein breakdown and reduce water content (68-77% of original). The leaves then undergo a process known in the industry as [...] "disruption" [...] or [...] "leaf maceration", which through bruising or cutting disrupts leaf cell structures, releasing the leaf juices and enzymes that activate oxidation. The oxidation process takes between 45–90 minutes to 3 hours and is done at high humidity between 20-30 degrees Celsius, transforming much of the catechins of the leaves into complex tannin. Orthodox processed black teas are further graded according to the post-production leaf quality by the Orange Pekoe system, while crush, tear, curl (CTC) teas use a different grading system. Orthodox tea leaves are heavily rolled either by hand or mechanically on a cylindrical rolling table or a rotorvane. The rolling table consists of a ridged table-top moving in an eccentric manner to a large hopper of tea leaves, of which the leaves are pressed down onto the table-top. The process produces a mixture of whole and broken leaves, and particles which are then sorted, oxidized, and dried. The rotovane consisted of <b>an</b> <b>auger</b> pushing withered tea leaves through a vane cylinder [...] which crushes and evenly cuts the leaves. Crush, tear, curl is a production method developed by William McKercher in 1930 which uses machines with contra-rotating rotors with surfaces patterning that cut and tear the leaves producing a product popular for use in tea bags. The rotovane to often use to precut the withered tea prior to the CTC and to create broken orthodox processed black tea.|$|E

2500|$|The {{benefits}} of continuous presses is the [...] "continuous" [...] sequence that allows {{large volumes of}} grapes to be pressed with minimum labor involvement. Instead of pressing separate batches {{that need to be}} emptied and refilled, continuous press typically have an input area and some mechanism (such as <b>an</b> <b>auger</b> screw or belt) that transfers the grapes through the pressings with an output area for the discarded cake. The throughput is limited by the capacity of the tank and the diameter of the screw or width of the belts. Many models of continuous screw presses can process from 50 to upwards of a 100 metric tonnes an hour. This can be a significant advantage for a high volume winery compared to batch presses that often only process 1 to 5 tonnes an hour.|$|E
2500|$|Wine presses are {{generally}} classified into two types—batch and continuous. Batch presses involve pressing a set amount (a [...] "batch") of grapes {{with the press}} needing to be emptied of the pomace or [...] "cake" [...] (the leftover skins, seeds and stems) between batches. There are many different styles of batch presses ranging from simple hand operated basket presses to computerized membrane presses and presses that are [...] "opened" [...] with oxygen able to {{come into contact with}} the must or [...] "enclosed" [...] in a tank that allows for anaerobic winemaking. Continuous presses use a helical screw (such as <b>an</b> <b>auger)</b> or belt that transports the grapes from a feed in across a cylindrical screen or between air pressured filled pads that presses the grapes, compacts the cakes and then removes the cake through an output all in one continuous operation.|$|E

The rolling table consists of a ridged table-top moving in an eccentric manner to a large hopper of tea leaves, of which the leaves are pressed down onto the table-top. The process produces a mixture of whole and broken leaves and particles which are then sorted, oxidized and dried. [...] The rotorvane (rotovane), created by Ian McTear in 1957 can be used to replicate the orthodox process. [...] The rotovane consisted of <b>an</b> <b>auger</b> pushing withered tea leaves through a vane cylinder which crushes and evenly cuts the leaves, however the process is more recently superseded by the boruah continuous roller, which consists of an oscillating conical roller around the inside of a ridged cylinder. The rotorvane can consistently duplicate broken orthodox processed black tea of even sized broken leaves, however it cannot produce whole leaf black tea. The broken leaves and particles from the orthodox method can feed into the CTC method for further processing into fanning or dust grade teas.|$|E
5000|$|Most of {{the actual}} {{resurfacing}} components are contained in a heavy device {{at the rear of}} the machine, known as the [...] "conditioner". The conditioner is hydraulically lowered to the ice surface, its weight providing the friction necessary for a large, sharp blade (similar to those used in industrial paper cutters) to shave off the top layer of ice. <b>A</b> horizontal <b>auger</b> collects these ice shavings, or snow, and funnels them to <b>a</b> vertical <b>auger</b> at the center of the conditioner. The shavings are then carried upward and sprayed into a large snow container, which takes up most of the volume of the resurfacer. In early models, a paddle-and-chain conveyor was used instead of <b>a</b> second, vertical <b>auger.</b> The height of the blade can be adjusted by the driver, allowing deeper or shallower cuts.
