Adapalene is a third-generation topical retinoid primarily used in the treatment of mild-moderate acne. Niosomes containing adapalene were prepared by lipid film hydration technique using nonionic surfactants (span 60) and cholesterol at different concentrations. <b>All</b> the niosomal <b>formulations</b> were evaluated for FTIR studies, entrapment efficiency, optical microscopy, stability studies, in-vitro drug release study, and zeta potential analysis.

The result suggests that in all the prepared niosomal formulations as the surfactant concentration increases the entrapment efficiency increases. Lower the cholesterol concentration higher the entrapment efficiency in span 60 formulations. The size of niosomes was found to be uniform and spherical in shape. The entrapment efficiencies of <b>all</b> <b>formulation</b> were calculated. The IR spectral analysis suggested that there was no interaction between the drug and formulation excipients.
