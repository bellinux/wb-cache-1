40|$|The data on {{pedigree}} {{and performance}} records of 1666 Teddy goats maintained at the Livestock Production research Institute Bahadurnagar (Okara), Pakistan were analyzed {{in the present}} study. Birth weight, weaning weight, yearling weight; pre-weaning growth, age at first kidding and number of kids weaned were the traits analyzed. The bivariate model of derivative-free restricted maximum likelihood (DFREML) computer programme was used to estimate the correlations. Significant genetic correlations were found between birth <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> weaning <b>weight</b> (0. 69) <b>and</b> weaning <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> yearling <b>weight</b> (0. 61) while phenotypic correlations between birth <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> weaning <b>weight</b> (0. 65), birth <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> age at first kidding (- 0. 61) <b>and</b> weaning <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> yearling <b>weight</b> (0. 52) were found significant.

Other complications may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract and include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and tiredness. The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum.

The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus {{at the time of his}} death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign. Upon his accession he revalued the Roman currency dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the denarius from 90% to 98% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87grams to 3.26grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a devaluation of the silver purity <b>and</b> <b>weight</b> to 93.5% and 3.04grams respectively.|$|E

The calibre <b>and</b> <b>weight</b> of secondary armament tended to increase, as the range of torpedoes and the staying power of the destroyers expected to carry them also increased. From the end of World War I onwards, battleships had to be equipped with many light guns as anti-aircraft armament.|$|E
5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is an abnormality of the {{hip joint}} which can cause crippling lameness and arthritis. The cats most commonly affected with hip dysplasia tend to be males of the larger, big-boned breeds such as Persians and Maine Coons.

X-rays submitted to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) between 1974 and 2011 indicates that 24.3% of Maine Coons in the database were dysplastic.
