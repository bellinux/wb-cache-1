In the interview with the Observer, she revealed that she had attempted to hide her condition, {{since she was a}} teenager, and had tried to make her body <b>as</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>as</b> possible to compensate for the condition. In the interview, she said that she became an overachiever in an effort to tell herself that she was okay.|$|E

Perhaps laceration, prolapse and all the evils are, in fact, natural to labor and in fact normal... If you adopt this view, I have no ground to stand on, but, if you believe that a woman after delivery should be <b>as</b> <b>healthy,</b> <b>as</b> well as anatomically perfect as she was before, and that the child should be undamaged, then you will have to agree with me that labor is pathogenic, because experience has proved such ideal results exceedingly rare." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the podium}} {{interviews}} conducted by Jackie Stewart, Lewis Hamilton conceded {{it had been}} a tough race, saying: [...] "The Ferraris gave us a real good run for our money and out there it was really difficult to look after the tyres in these conditions, behind backmarkers and all sorts, but fortunately I was able to keep the car together, keep the tyres <b>as</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>as</b> possible and pull it through." [...] Kimi Räikkönen expressed disappointment with not being able to win, but said he was [...] "very happy how the team is working" [...] and highlighted the big step forward Ferrari had made over the winter. Nico Rosberg was disappointed about the brake failure costing him second place, but added that he was very happy with the car altogether.|$|E

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Dallas and the Trinity River was never <b>as</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>as</b> Dallasites {{hoped it would}} be. Dallas was established {{on the banks of}} the Trinity in hopes that navigation south to the Trinity and Galveston Bays, and ultimately the Gulf of Mexico, would eventually be possible. However, attempts to move even paddleboats up and down the river proved futile, and plans to transform the river into a canal never came to fruition. The Trinity also suffered from chronic flooding: floods occurred in 1844, 1866, 1871, and 1890, but none were as severe as the flood of 1908. On May 26, 1908, the Trinity River reached a depth of [...] and a width of [...] [...] Five people died, 4,000 were left homeless, and property damages were estimated at $2.5 million.|$|E

2500|$|After she {{finished}} her autobiography Livsglede {{in the beginning of}} 2010, Margit Sandemos sister, Eva Underdal, told her she was actually raped a fourth time. [...] Margit had come home late one evening in the age of nine, pale as a sheet, with knees covered in scratches. She must have rejected the memory of this event later as she has no memory of it. These tragic and violent experiences led to her attempted suicide at the age of 17, using sleeping pills. Three days later however, she was <b>as</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>as</b> before.|$|E

2500|$|Moreover, {{the laws}} of many {{countries}} permit IVF for only single women, lesbian couples, and persons participating in surrogacy arrangements. Using PGD gives members of these select demographic groups disproportionate access to a means of creating a child possessing characteristics that they consider [...] "ideal," [...] raising issues of equal opportunity for both the parents'/parent's and the child's generation. [...] Many fertile couples now demand equal access to embryonic screening so that their child can be just <b>as</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>as</b> one created through IVF. [...] Mass use of PGD, especially {{as a means of}} population control or in the presence of legal measures related to population or demographic control, can lead to intentional or unintentional demographic effects such as the skewed live-birth sex ratios seen in communist China following implementation of its one-child policy.|$|E
2500|$|Author Lisa Moore {{suggests}} that Dworkin's explanation {{does not take}} into account that it is the pleasure the actresses exhibit that the male partners enjoy, and that it is more accurate to think men want their semen to be wanted. Women's activist Beatrice Faust argued, [...] "since ejaculating into blank space is not much fun, ejaculating over a person who responds with enjoyment sustains a lighthearted mood as well as a degree of realism." [...] She goes on to say [...] "Logically, if sex is natural and wholesome and semen is <b>as</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>as</b> sweat, there is no reason to interpret ejaculation as a hostile gesture." [...] Joseph Slade, professor at Ohio University, notes in his book Pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide that adult industry actresses in the 1960s and 1970s did not trust birth control methods, and that more than one actress of the period told him that ejaculation inside her body was deemed inconsiderate if not rude.|$|E

[...] Emily said, [...] "My biggest motivations for working my hardest to stay <b>as</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>as</b> possible — {{even in the face}} of an advanced and progressing fatal illness — are my family and friends, this burning desire to do more things and see more places, and the unbelievable Entourage that rallied behind me to give me and so many others real, tangible hope for that chance." [...] People magazine wrote, [...] "Perhaps the most critical of Emily's Entourage's efforts has been its success in putting a beautiful face on an ugly issue.

2500|$|Ever {{since the}} first humans arrived in Alaska over the Bering land bridge, {{encounters}} between people and Kodiak bears have occurred. Today, these encounters have become more common {{as a result of}} the increase in the human population in the region. Such encounters have included the hunting of bears by humans for their fur or meat, and, less commonly, attacks by bears upon humans. More recently, as conservation efforts have become more commonplace, concerns over the sustenance and stability of the Kodiak bear population have arisen. The IUCN classifies Ursus arctos, the species to which the Kodiak belongs, as being of [...] "least concern" [...] in terms of endangerment or extinction. However, the IUCN does not differentiate between subspecies; therefore, it is unknown whether the Kodiak bear population is <b>as</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>as</b> is stated. As a result, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, along with, to a lesser extent, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, closely monitors the number of bears hunted in the state.|$|E
2500|$|The Indian {{rhinoceros}} {{was initially}} difficult to breed in captivity. The first recorded captive {{birth of a}} rhinoceros was in Kathmandu in 1826, but another successful birth did not occur for nearly 100 years. In 1925, a rhino was born in Kolkata. No rhinoceros was successfully bred in Europe until 1956. On September 14, 1956, [...] Rudra was born in Zoo Basel, Switzerland. In {{the second half of}} the 20th century, zoos became adept at breeding Indian rhinoceros. By 1983, nearly 40 babies had been born in captivity. As of 2012, 33 Indian rhinos were born at Zoo Basel, which means that most animals kept in a zoo are somehow related to the population in the zoo of Basel, Switzerland. Due to the success of Zoo Basel's breeding program, the International Studbook for the species has been kept there since 1972. Since 1990, the Indian rhino European Endangered Species Programme is being coordinated there, as well, which ensures that the captive global Indian rhinoceros population stays genetically <b>as</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>as</b> possible. As of 2010, 174 rhinos are kept in zoos worldwide.|$|E
