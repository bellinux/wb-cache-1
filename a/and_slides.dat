5|$|Compared {{to other}} {{shooters}} where melee {{is usually a}} last resort, F.E.A.R.'s melee is a viable instant-kill alternative for taking down enemies. The stocks of all firearms {{can be used in}} close combat. Lighter weapons, while being less powerful, allow the player to move around more quickly, increasing their chances of melee. Movement speed is maximized if a player holsters their weapon, which also allows them to engage in hand-to-hand attacks with maneuvers including punches, kicks, <b>and</b> <b>slides.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2015, a modernized {{version of}} Thumbelina {{appears in the}} Disney Junior series, Goldie and Bear. In the episode Thumbelina's Wild Ride, Thumbelina (voiced by Debby Ryan with her singing voice {{provided}} by Shannon Chan-Kent) is hired to babysit for Goldie and Bear. The two friends are initially put off by her small stature, thinking she's almost helpless. When she tries getting the kids a snack, she falls down the kitchen sink <b>and</b> <b>slides</b> into the river behind the house. Goldie and Bear try to save her, but soon see that Thumbelina is resourceful, agile, and can lift several times her own weight. She saves herself from the river and even rescues the kids when they fall in trying to save her. The kids take an instant liking to Thumbellina and can't {{wait for the next}} time she babysits.|$|E
5|$|The FBI {{intends to}} plant a fake {{advertisement}} to replace Lecktor's, but they realize that without the proper book code the Tooth Fairy will know it is fake; therefore, they let the advertisement run as it is, and Graham organizes an interview with Lounds, during which he gives a false and derogatory profile of the Tooth Fairy to incite him. After a sting operation fails to catch the killer, Lounds is kidnapped by the Tooth Fairy (Tom Noonan). Waking in the killer's home, he is shown a slideshow of William Blake's The Great Red Dragon paintings, along with the Tooth Fairy's past victims <b>and</b> <b>slides</b> of a family the killer identifies as his next targets. Lounds is forced to tape-record a statement before being set on fire in a wheelchair and killed, his flaming body rolled into the parking garage of the National Tattler as a warning.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears), walking {{out of her house}} hand-in-hand with an {{unidentified}} man. The couple leaves in the woman's car (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake rolls down the window of a black Mercedes, from which he and his friend have been watching the woman. Timberlake breaks into the house by throwing a rock through a window and proceeds through the woman's house, with anti-gravity jumps <b>and</b> <b>slides,</b> not causing any other visible damage, except for kicking a picture frame of the woman across the living room. Then he searches some drawers and finds a video camera, while the driver of the car, Timbaland, signals for his female accomplice {{in the back of the}} car, played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.|$|E

40|$|In this research, {{friction}} {{coefficients of}} engineering polymers such as nylon and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are investigated under normal load <b>and</b> <b>sliding</b> velocity. Experiments are conducted when nylon <b>and</b> PTFE <b>slide</b> against different counterface pin {{materials such as}} mild steel and stainless steel 202 (SS 202). Experiments are carried out at different normal loads 2, 4 and 6 N, <b>and</b> <b>sliding</b> velocities 0. 2, 0. 4 and 0. 6 m/s. Results show that in general, friction coefficient of nylon decreases {{with the increase in}} normal load <b>and</b> <b>sliding</b> velocity. On the other hand, during friction process, PTFE shows different trend i. e. friction coefficient of PTFE increases with the increase in normal load <b>and</b> <b>sliding</b> velocity. Moreover, it is observed that at identical operating conditions, the values of friction coefficient of nylon and PTFE are different depending on normal load, <b>sliding</b> velocity <b>and</b> counterface material...|$|R
