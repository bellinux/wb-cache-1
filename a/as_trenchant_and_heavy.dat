He was commonplace in complexion, in features, in manners, and in voice. He was of middle size and of ordinary build. His eyes, of the usual blue, were perhaps remarkably cold, and he certainly could make his glance fall on one <b>as</b> <b>trenchant</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> as an ax. But even at these times {{the rest of his}} person seemed to disclaim the intention. Otherwise there was only an indefinable, faint expression of his lips, something stealthy--a smile--not a smile--I remember it, but I can't explain. It was unconscious, this smile was, though just after he had said something it got intensified for an instant. It came {{at the end of his}} speeches like a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase appear absolutely inscrutable. He was a common trader, from his youth up employed in these parts--nothing more. He was obeyed, yet he inspired neither love nor fear, nor even respect. He inspired uneasiness. That was it! Uneasiness. Not a definite mistrust--just uneasiness--nothing more. You have no idea how effective such a [...] . a [...] . faculty can be.

Because triumphant health in the general rout of constitutions is a kind of power in itself. When he went home on leave he rioted on a large scale--pompously. Jack ashore--with a difference--in externals only. This one could gather from his casual talk. He originated nothing, he could keep the routine going--that's all. But he was great. He was great by this little thing that it was impossible to tell what could control such a man. He never gave that secret away. Perhaps there was nothing within him. Such a suspicion made one pause--for out there there were no external checks. Once when various tropical diseases had laid low almost every 'agent' in the station, he was heard to say, 'Men who come out here should have no entrails.' He sealed the utterance with that smile of his, as though it had been a door opening into a darkness he had in his keeping. You fancied you had seen things--but the seal was on. When annoyed at meal-times by the constant quarrels of the white men about precedence, he ordered an immense round table to be made, for which a special house had to be built. This was the station's mess-room. Where he sat was the first place--the rest were nowhere. One felt this to be his unalterable conviction. He was neither civil nor uncivil. He was quiet. He allowed his 'boy'--an overfed young negro from the coast--to treat the white men, under his very eyes, with provoking insolence.|$|E

6000|$|So far as {{they are}} quite clear, they are imperfect, and knowingly imperfect, if {{considered}} as painters of real appearances; but by means of this very imperfection or conventionalism, they often give certain facts which are more necessary to their purpose than these outward appearances. For instance, in Fig. 2 of Plate 25, facing page 32, I requested Mr. Le Keux to facsimile, as far as might be, {{the look of the}} daguerreotype; and he has admirably done so. But if Albert Durer had drawn the wall between those towers, he would have represented it with all its facts distinctly revealed, as in Fig. 1; and in many respects this clear statement is precious, though, so far as regards ocular truth, it is not natural. A modern sketcher of the [...] "bold" [...] school would represent the tower as in Fig. 3; that is to say, in a manner just <b>as</b> <b>trenchant</b> <b>and</b> firm, and therefore ocularly false, as Durer's; but, in all probability, which involved entireness of fallacy or ignorance as to the wall facts; rendering the work nearly valueless; or valuable only in color or composition; not as draughtsmanship.|$|R

2500|$|Widely seen <b>as</b> unyielding <b>and</b> <b>trenchant</b> in {{his public}} stance, and {{respected}} as an orator, P. P.

Welcoming Westernization and free trade, his vision of development nonetheless rested on gradualism and criticized modern experiments in governance. The two Carp administrations are remembered for their fiscal reforms, their encouragement of foreign investments, and their attempted clampdown on political corruption.|$|R

His eldest son, Douglas, died in 1829 at the outset of what had promised to be a brilliant career. This grief his father never forgot, but nothing could quite destroy the cheerfulness of his later life. His Three Letters to Archdeacon Singleton on the Ecclesiastical Commission (1837-38-39) and his Petition and Letters on the repudiation of debts by the state of Pennsylvania (1843) are <b>as</b> bright <b>and</b> <b>trenchant</b> <b>as</b> his best contributions to the Edinburgh Review.

40|$|No law {{book has}} enjoyed greater acclaim from {{distinguished}} commentators over a sustained period than has Hart 2 ̆ 6 Wechsler 2 ̆ 7 s The Federal Courts and the Federal System. Indeed, the praise seems to escalate from one edition to the next. Reviewing the first edition, published forty-three years ago, Philip Kurland called it 2 ̆ 2 the definitive {{text on the}} subject of federal jurisdiction. 2 ̆ 2 Paul Mishkin added that 2 ̆ 2 the analysis is of an order difficult to match anywhere. 2 ̆ 2 In his review of the second edition, published in 1973, Henry Monaghan began by praising the first for having 2 ̆ 2 deservedly achieved a reputation that is extraordinary among casebooks, 2 ̆ 2 and then continued: 2 ̆ 2 [M]y view is that the second edition is at nearly every material point better than its predecessor. 2 ̆ 2 When the third edition appeared in 1988, Akhil Amar called the first edition 2 ̆ 2 beautiful and brilliant, 2 ̆ 2 and thought the third 2 ̆ 2 better in many respects. 2 ̆ 2 No doubt similar encomia will greet the recently published fourth edition. Certainly the research is as thorough, the analysis <b>as</b> <b>trenchant,</b> <b>and</b> the questions <b>as</b> probing as ever. Hart 2 ̆ 6 Wechsler continues to set the standard that other books must aspire to meet. Yet technical virtuosity and comparative merit are not the only tests by which a casebook may be judged. At the risk of losing my union card in the Federal Courts workshop, I proposed to show that the editors, through all four editions, are fundamentally misguided in their approach to Federal Courts law. This article questions the methodology Hart 2 ̆ 6 Wechsler, and Federal Courts scholars who follow its lead, use in addressing Federal Courts issues. Part I lays out the Hart 2 ̆ 6 Wechsler model of Federal Courts law. Part II distinguishes naked substance from jurisdictional policy and traces the impact of substantive themes of jurisdictional doctrine. Part III finds fault with the fourth edition 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of substance. Part IV explains why these themes are given little systemic attention by this and other casebooks. Part V argues that the editors are wrong to deemphasize them...|$|R

My cold berth would swallow up like a chilly burial niche my bodily shivers and my mental excitement. It was a cruel winter. The very air seemed <b>as</b> hard <b>and</b> <b>trenchant</b> <b>as</b> steel; but it would have taken much more than this to extinguish my sacred fire for the exercise of my craft. No young man of twenty-four appointed chief mate {{for the first time in}} his life would have let that Dutch tenacious winter penetrate into his heart. I think that in those days I never forgot the fact of my elevation for five consecutive minutes. I fancy it kept me warm, even in my slumbers, better than the high pile of blankets, which positively crackled with frost as I threw them off in the morning. And I would get up early for no reason whatever except that I was in sole charge. The new captain had not been appointed yet.|$|R
