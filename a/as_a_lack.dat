5|$|In 1891, German {{botanist}} Otto Kuntze published Revisio generum plantarum, {{his response}} to what he perceived <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of method in existing nomenclatural practice. He revived the genus Atylus {{on the grounds of}} priority, and correctly made the combination Atylus anemonifolius. However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists. Ultimately, the genus Isopogon was nomenclaturally conserved over Atylus by the International Botanical Congress of 1905.|$|E
5|$|In May 2016, several {{injuries}} in the Italian squad, as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of attacking options and Totti's run of good form {{as a substitute for}} Roma, led some in the media to call for manager Antonio Conte to include Totti as a reserve in Italy's Euro 2016 squad; however, he was later left out of Conte's 30-man preliminary Italy squad for the final tournament.|$|E
5|$|The board did not {{investigate}} whether any USAF institutional factors, such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of crew resource management {{training for the}} involved aircrews, {{might have been a}} factor. Also, the board did not attempt to determine if Wickson and May had violated any of the existing OPC rules of engagement as defined by the ATO or other written instructions.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the second}} leg, Ridsdale took out {{advertisements}} in British newspapers calling for calm, with the messages in the adverts also being translated into Turkish. Despite this, West Yorkshire Police warned local Turkish businesses to close early. When Galatasaray officials arrived at Elland Road {{for the second}} leg, hundreds of Leeds fans attacked the coach busses that were carrying them which delayed the kick-off of the second leg. During the first minute of the match, Leeds fans {{turned their backs on}} the match in protest of, what was viewed <b>as,</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of justice.|$|E
5|$|Göring spent The Hardest Day at Karinhall {{with two}} of his top fighter pilots, Werner Mölders and Adolf Galland. He was decorating them with the Combined Pilots-Observation Badge in Gold with Diamonds after they had {{achieved}} much success in recent weeks. However, Göring took the opportunity to berate them over bomber losses and in particular, what he saw, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of aggression in the Jagdwaffe. This criticism was not received well by the two men. Göring moved to quickly reconcile with them by ordering their promotion to Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) in command of their respective Geschwader (Wings). Göring felt a younger generation of combat leaders would help motivate the force. They were dismissed.|$|E

5|$|In January of the {{following}} year, state Assemblyman Wadie Deddeh proposed legislation to remove the southern portion of SR 125 from the state highway plans again. Soon afterward, the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO) moved to support retaining SR 125 from Poway to Santee in the county transportation plan, despite opposition from a county supervisor and the mayor of Escondido. Deddeh's bill passed the state Assembly Transportation Committee a month later; in the meeting, Deddeh noted the construction of I-805 to handle the traffic demands of the region, as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of funding {{that would result in}} the construction being delayed for at least 20 years. Despite a petition from the mayor of Escondido, the CPO again declined to remove SR 125 from the county transportation plan in March.|$|E
5|$|The first {{seaplanes}} used in combat, {{supplied by}} French manufacturer Donnet-Lévêque, were operated from Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand {{and her two}} sisters during the blockade. However, the Austro-Hungarian Navy was {{not satisfied with the}} operation, as the ships lacked enough deck space for the planes, as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of cranes with which they could easily hoist the planes onto the decks. The planes were later moved to a hangar at the navy yard in Teodo. By 1913, the four new dreadnoughts of the —the only dreadnoughts built for the fleet—were coming into active service. With the commissioning of these dreadnoughts, the navy shifted Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand and her sisters to the 2nd Division of the 1st Battle Squadron.|$|E
5|$|The label {{was founded}} in 1996 in Durham, North Carolina by {{musician}} Kaia Wilson and artist/UNC photography professor Tammy Rae Carland, aiming to redress what they saw <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of feminist record labels at the time. As well as a range of recording artists, the label was also heavily involved in other events that promoted feminist thinking and music, such as the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival – which led to some controversy in 1999 – and various art showcases. Mr. Lady closed down in June 2004.|$|E
50|$|John L. Allen, Jr., Vatican {{correspondent}} for the NCR, has commented that many American Catholics saw the Vatican's initial silence on the Boston Globe stories <b>as</b> evidence of <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of concern or awareness about the issue. Allen described the Vatican's perspective as being somewhat skeptical of the media handling of the scandal. In addition, he asserted that the Vatican viewed American cultural attitudes toward sexuality as being somewhat hysterical, as well <b>as</b> exhibiting <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> {{of understanding of the}} Catholic Church.|$|R

5|$|Tropical Cyclone Tam {{originated}} out {{of tropical}} depression while located about 370km (230mi) to the north-northeast of Fiji on January6. The system, designated 04F by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji tracked slowly towards the west. Although the depression was located within {{an area of}} low wind shear, little intensification occurred, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of low-level moisture hindered the development of deep convection. By January9, shower and thunderstorm activity associated with the disturbance increased as it began {{to interact with the}} South Pacific Convergence Zone. Another tropical depression, 05F, also became increasingly organized and at one point was forecast to absorb 04F. Following the weakening of Tropical Depression 05F, 04F intensified. Around 2000UTC on January11, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as deep convection persisted around the center of circulation for several hours.|$|E
5|$|With Esther's {{character}} based loosely {{on her own}} adolescence, Randall {{was inspired}} to write the film's script by what she saw <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of role models for teenage girls. In 2002, the script earned her a fellowship to the Los Angeles Film School's Feature Development Programme, where she developed the project, and it was later picked up by Tama Films. Randall returned to Australia for casting, and Catanzariti was eventually chosen in the lead role after she attended an audition for minor roles and extras. Production spanned from October to December 2006, with filming taking place in Adelaide, South Australia and Sydney, New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|As the Sole Survivor {{gradually}} expands their influence, tape {{recordings and}} journal entries reveal that despite its popularity, Nuka-World was under threat from serious mismanagement {{in the weeks}} and months prior to the Great War. Gradually, John-Caleb Bradberton, the creator of Nuka-Cola and the architect of Nuka-World, is revealed to have redirected resources to fund Project Cobalt, a weapons development project for the United States military. This culminated in the creation of Nuka-Cola Quantum, a variation of Nuka-Cola made with radioactive isotopes. In exchange for his support, the military agreed to include Bradberton in LEAP-X, an attempt to artificially prolong life; however, Braxton, the general in charge of Project Cobalt, saw Bradberton's prediction of an imminent war <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of confidence in the military, and thus betrayed him. When the Sole Survivor accesses Bradberton's office, they discover a hidden elevator leading to a private Vault. Inside is Bradberton's still-living head attached to a life support machine, a punishment by Braxton for doubting the military. The player is given the choice of shutting off the power and euthanizing Bradberton at his request, or keeping him alive for the sake of Sierra Petrovita, a recurring character from Fallout 3 who idolises Bradberton.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{tendered}} {{his resignation}} from office on December 1, 1794, giving Washington two months' notice, {{in the wake of}} his wife Eliza's miscarriage while he was absent during his armed repression of the Whiskey Rebellion. Before leaving his post on January 31, 1795, Hamilton submitted a Report on a Plan for the Further Support of Public Credit to Congress to curb the debt problem. Hamilton grew dissatisfied with what he viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of a comprehensive plan to fix the public debt. He wished to have new taxes passed with older ones made permanent and stated that any surplus from the excise tax on liquor would be pledged to lower public debt. His proposals were included into a bill by Congress within slightly over a month after his departure as treasury secretary. Some months later Hamilton resumed his law practice in New York to remain closer to his family.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, many colleges and school districts across Florida remained closed. President George W. Bush declared all of Florida a federal disaster area. Kennedy Space Center did not restore its complete work force until September 13 due to relief operations, as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of gasoline, ice, and water in the area. A total of 8000 members of the National Guard helped out with recovery efforts soon after the storm left the Florida peninsula. Residents in the areas of impact after the storm were under a boil water order, {{because of the lack of}} electricity to area water systems. Churches prepared meals for those without power and food themselves. Federal employees were granted excused absences if they helped with law enforcement and the cleanup. Thousands of portable generators were sent to the state by Home Depot and Lowe's home improvement stores. The United States Army Corps of Engineers installed blue tarpaulins on 41,556 damaged roofs statewide. Damage to the Florida citrus crop caused orange futures to rise four cents a pound due to Frances.|$|E
5|$|Interest from {{military}} leaders for an airport at Banak returned in 1955. The Air Force was mainly {{concerned that they}} could not reach the easternmost parts of Norway from Bodø Main Air Station. This allowed for several Soviet infringements of Norwegian air space. Alternative locations were considered, such as Kautokeino, were a radar had been built. NATO supported a reconstruction of Banak, partially raised by increased focus towards NATO's northern flank, and also to serve as part of the nuclear program. NATO was ready to provide funding in 1957, but by then Norwegian authorities were wanting to delay its construction. They cited lack of personnel to man the station as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of usability in times of war. The government decided in 1957 to disallow nuclear warheads to be stored in Norway during peacetime, thus eliminating NATO's strategic need for Banak. The air station was therefore removed from the investment program.|$|E

5|$|Lindwall {{was only}} in the Third XI of St. George at the time, but by December, he was in the First XI along with future Invincibles {{teammate}} Arthur Morris. The senior team was captained by Bill O'Reilly, a leg spin bowler who represented Australia in Tests and was regarded as the best bowler in the world. O'Reilly was a firm man and came to be a father figure for Lindwall. Lindwall came into the team seeing himself as an into-the-wind swing bowler. O'Reilly felt that pace bowlers were only useful for a few overs with new ball, so he instructed Lindwall to lengthen his run-up and bowl as fast as possible. O’Reilly also decided that the team needed more bowlers. He placed Lindwall low in the batting order, where he often did not get an opportunity to bat. Lindwall did not bother protesting, realising that dissent against the autocratic O’Reilly would be futile. O'Reilly also reversed Morris from a bowler into a batsman. Both Morris and Lindwall became world-leading players in the fields that O’Reilly chose for them. By the end of the 1938–39 season, Lindwall had not yet established himself as a cricketer. Former Test batsman Charlie Macartney lamented what he perceived <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of talent and substance at St. George. Lindwall returned to school, attempting to obtain his Leaving Certificate while also playing third-grade rugby. In July, Lindwall's father died, leaving him and his four siblings orphaned.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{location of}} the La Cobata head was not a major archaeological site {{and it is likely}} that the head was either abandoned at its source or during transport to its intended destination. Various features of the head suggest that it was unfinished, such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of symmetry below the mouth and an area of rough stone above the base. Rock was not removed from around the earspools as on other heads, and does not narrow towards the base. Large parts of the monument seem to be roughed out without finished detail. The right hand earspool also appears incomplete; the forward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief, probably indicating that the right cheek and eye area were also unfinished. The La Cobata head was almost certainly carved from a raw boulder rather than being sculpted from a throne.|$|E

50|$|Semteende (shame) is best {{described}} both <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lacking</b> of restraint (gacce/yaage) and self-control in daily social interaction, and evidencing a weakness when facing adversity. It {{is most often}} translated as shame. When someone acts shamefully, Fulbe say o sempti, meaning they shamed themselves, or alternatively, o walaa semteende (o wala gacce), meaning they have no shame. In other words, a pullo must know of the social constraints on behavior {{and be able to}} avoid contravening them in all situations, especially in front of others. A true fulani is in total control of his emotions and impulses.|$|R
