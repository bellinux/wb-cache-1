40|$|Improving the {{international}} trading {{system does not}} require new, comprehensive multilateral agreements. Countries can derive large gains from the trading system by engaging in reforms {{often referred to as}} trade facilitation. In broad terms, trade facilitation includes reforms aimed at improving the chain of administrative and physical procedures involved in the transport of goods and services across international borders. Countries with inadequate trade infrastructure, burdensome administrative processes, or limited competition in trade logistics services are less capable of benefiting from the opportunities of expanding global trade. Companies interested in investing, buying, or selling in local markets are less likely to bother if there are too many frictions related to document processing or cargo inspection at customs, <b>antiquated</b> port <b>facilities,</b> logistics bottlenecks, or limited reliability of freight or trade-financing services. According to recent studies from the World Bank and other international economic institutions, trade facilitation reforms could do more to increase global trade flows than further reductions in tariff rates. For many developing countries [...] particularly those that receive preferential tariff treatment from rich countries [...] reducing transportation and logistics-related costs through trade facilitation reforms would be much more beneficial than further tariff cuts. But trade facilitation does not only offer promise to developing countries. All countries can benefit by removing sources of friction in their supply chains. The post- 9 / 11 focus on minimizing the risk of terrorists exploiting porous international supply chains to sneak weapons of mass destruction into U. S. cities [...] obviously a vital objective [...] could hamper the capacity of Americanbased companies to attract investment and compete for markets. Likewise, U. S. prohibitions against foreign competition in transportation services and the political antipathy toward foreign investment in U. S. port operations raise the costs of doing business and increase the scope for trade facilitation in the United States...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} a dormant farm site {{in which a}} body of work is being developed in effort to examine the past character and future shape of Iowa 2 ̆ 7 s inherited landscape. The content of this exploration was generated in response, and as an addition, to David Heymann 2 ̆ 7 s essay 2 ̆ 2 Precise, Anonymous, Enigmatic 2 ̆ 2 published in the 1990 winter issue of Iowa Architect. In that critically perceptive article, Heymann traces the evolution of the Midwestern landscape by examining farm buildings within rural Iowa. Central to the evolution that Heymann cites is the specific topography due to wind erosion. Heymann uses this dynamic to illustrate a perceived stability given the tectonic nature of farm building construction and associated spatial configurations. If the centerline of Heymann 2 ̆ 7 s thinking is that instability in land morphology (though difficult to optically register) has produced a tectonic perceptual stability, the conceit of this essay Is that such stability no longer exists, and that a shift in the scales of economy has yielded an outwardly visible tectonic instability. Thus to Heymann 2 ̆ 7 s transformation is added the inverse consequence and thereby directly linking the visual evidence of an unstable (derelict) building set to the intellectual evidence of an unstable ground plane. This relationship of figure to ground is the basis for staging a series of intensely modulated spatial reconstructions within an <b>antiquated</b> seed drying <b>facility</b> that, like Iowa 2 ̆ 7 s farm buildings and land-use practices, is intrinsically grounded In the spatial and cognitive confines of its surround...|$|R
40|$|Water {{users in}} the Lower Rio Grande Basin of Texas have {{depended}} on {{the flow of the}} Rio Grande to supply water for agricultural as well as municipal and industrial purposes. Although the area is a major agricultural production region, it faces continuing problems associated with use of irrigation water from the Rio Grande. Periodic water shortages threaten to limit the potential growth and economic well-being of the area. Inefficient use of available water supplies as a result of inadequate and/or <b>antiquated</b> distribution <b>facilities</b> and inefficient management of water on farms contributes to the depletion of available water supplies for irrigation and other uses. The objectives of this study were: (1) to study the effects of water rights as allocative devices for water; to determine the impact on cropping patterns and water use efficiency of a change which would make rights negotiable, and (2) to study the influence of Water Control and Improvement Districts on the distribution and use of water; to determine whether the ways in which these districts are organized and operated may cause them to act as facilitating or obstructing elements in the efficient development and use of water resources in the Valley. To meet the first objective, parametric linear programming was used to analyze the impact of negotiable water rights on cropping patterns and enterprise combinations. If the institution of water rights were changed so as to make annual allotments negotiable, market forces could be expected to move the resource into uses in which it has a higher value. Water price was varied from $ 9. 60 per acre foot to $ 96. 00 per acre foot. At a price of $ 9. 60, which is approximately the present cost of irrigation water delivered at the farm gate, producers could profitably use almost 2, 000, 000 acre feet of water per year. At this price, 83 percent of the irrigable lands and 77 percent of the water used in the Valley would be devoted to the production of cotton and grain sorghum. At a water price of $ 18. 65 per acre foot or higher, grain sorghum production in the Valley reverts dryland and water use for irrigation drops to 1, 363, 300 acre feet per year. At a price of $ 32. 45 or above, the land devoted to cotton would be switched to dryland grain sorghum production and water use would decline to 407, 900 acre feet annually. The use of parametric programming with variable water pricing allowed the derivation of a value-in-use or "conditional demand" curve for water. To meet the second objective of the study, data on the Valley Water Control and Improvement Districts were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. The dependent variable was delivery cost per acre irrigated. Size of district, acre feet pumped per acre irrigated, and percent of operating revenues derived from water deliveries were the independent variables. It was found that the optimum size district, from a least-cost standpoint, was 42, 355 acres. However, other institutional problems associated with District policy and organization would seem to more than offset cost advantages of reorganization and consolidation. Therefore, it does not seem likely that local water users would seek changes in the organizational structure of districts simply to take advantage of economies of size associated with consolidation. iii Rehabilitation of district facilities was analyzed using data from the parametric programming model for five levels of development. It was found that rehabilitation of district facilities is economically feasible, at least to the present level of water use in the Valley...|$|R

40|$|The {{decline of}} {{industrial}} research in East Germany has reached dramatic proportions. Of the 75. 000 researchers involved in industrial {{research at the}} beginning of 1990 - according to representative polls carried out {{at the beginning of}} October 1992 - at the most 15. 000 are still present in the new federal states. The number of industrial researchers, compared with the old federal states, has reached a ratio of 1 : 15. Moreover, the market for industrially oriented R&D in Germany is overstaffed in many fields; it is also characterized by decreasing research contracts from industry and cut-backs in state promotion of industry-related research. With this background it is especially difficult for institutions of the public R&D infrastructure and R&D enterprises in East Germany to become established: in th face of extremely unfavourable starting conditions (disrupted relations to earlier partners in industry, lack of capital, insecurity about property rights, <b>antiquated</b> <b>facilities,</b> danger of losing qualified personnel) they are exposed, in spite of high performance capability and willingness, to extremely tough competition. In the meantime, many attempts, via both economic and technology policy, are being made to promote the public R&D infrastructure and the innovative capability of Eastern German firms.
