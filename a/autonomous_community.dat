5|$|A 1998 {{estimate}} {{suggests the}} total annual worldwide consumption of Boletus edulis and {{closely related species}} (B.aereus, B.pinophilus, and B.reticulatus) to be between 20,000 and 100,000 tons. Approximately 2,700tonnes (3,000tons) were sold in France, Italy and Germany in 1988, according to official figures. The true amount consumed far exceeds this, as it {{does not account for}} informal sales or consumption by collectors. They are widely exported and sold in dried form, reaching countries where they do not occur naturally, such as Australia and New Zealand. The <b>autonomous</b> <b>community</b> of Castile and León in Spain produces 7,700tonnes (8,500tons) annually. In autumn, the price of porcini in the Northern Hemisphere typically ranges between $20 and $80dollars per kilogram, although in New York in 1997, the scarcity of fruit bodies elevated the wholesale price to over $200 per kilogram.|$|E
5|$|The current Basque {{coat of arms}} (Spanish: Escudo del País Vasco, Basque: Euskal autonomi erkidegoaren armarria) is the {{official}} coat of arms of the Basque Country, <b>Autonomous</b> <b>community</b> of Spain. It consists of a party per cross representing the three historical territories of Álava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay, {{as well as a}} fourth, void quarter. The arms are ringed by a regal wreath of oak leaves, symbolic of the Gernikako Arbola. The fourth quarter constituted since the late 19th century the linked chains of Navarre; however, following a legal suit by the Navarre Government claiming that the usage of the arms of a region on the flag of another was illegal, the Constitutional Court of Spain ordered the removal of the chains of Navarre in a judgement of 1986.|$|E

50|$|These {{villages are}} {{currently}} growing into communities {{in their own}} rights and {{are said to be}} the sons of Orodo according to oral tradition. Today, most of these villages have grown into what is commonly known as <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Communities.</b> In the late 1990s, the then Imo State Government split Orodo town into two <b>autonomous</b> <b>communities</b> namely, Isi-Orodo and Obi-Orodo. A few years later three new <b>autonomous</b> <b>communities</b> were also carved out of the former two, namely, Amaukwu, Ofekata and Ubaha, thus splitting Orodo into five (5) <b>autonomous</b> <b>communities.</b> Like most Igbo communities, the people of Orodo have always been democratic. It is worthy of note that despite the splitting of Orodo into five <b>autonomous</b> <b>communities</b> (some say for political reasons, and some claim it is to bring development to the grass-root level), the people of Orodo continue to enjoy strong ties and the bond of unity with one another, understanding that they enjoy a common ancestry.|$|R
