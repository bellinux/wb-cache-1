Patients and Methods: The stretched PL (SPL) of 102 patients was measured before, 10 days after, and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months <b>after</b> <b>RP.</b> The perpendicular distance from the distal end of the membranous urethra to the midline of the pelvic outlet was measured on mid-sagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slice at three time points: preoperatively; 10 days after RP; and 12 months <b>after</b> <b>RP.</b> Pre- and postoperative SPLs were compared using paired Student's t-test. Predictors of PL shortening at 10 days and at 12 months <b>after</b> <b>RP</b> were evaluated on univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: The SPL was shortest 10 days <b>after</b> <b>RP</b> (mean PL shortening from preoperative level: 19. 9 mm), and gradually recovered thereafter. SPL at 12 months <b>after</b> <b>RP</b> was {{not significantly different from}} preoperative SPL. On MRI examination, the distal end of membranous urethra was found to have moved proximally (mean proximal displacement: 3. 9 mm) at 10 days <b>after</b> <b>RP,</b> and to have returned to the preoperative position at 12 months <b>after</b> <b>RP.</b> On univariate analysis, only the volume of the removed prostate was a predictor of SPL change at 10 days after surgery; on multivariate analysis, the association was not statistically significant. No predictor of SPL change was found at 12 months <b>after</b> <b>RP.</b> Conclusion: The SPL was shortest at 10 days <b>after</b> <b>RP</b> and gradually recovered thereafter in the present study. Anatomically, the glans and corpus spongiosum surrounding the urethra are an integral structure, and the proximal urethra is drawn into the pelvis during urethrovesical anastomosis.

40|$|Introduction: Radical prostatectomy (RP) {{offers a}} good {{long-term}} cancer control for clinically localized prostate cancer. However, complications such as erectile dysfunction and substantial decreases {{quality of life}} of the afflicted men and their sexual partners. Identification of pre-, per-, and postoperative factors that correlate with poor postoperative erectile status must be considered an important step to improving penile rehabilitation. Aim: To describe postoperative erectile function <b>after</b> <b>RP</b> in a Danish cohort. Methods: The medical records of 1, 127 patients undergoing RP from March 2003 through September 2014 were reviewed retrospectively with a 12 -month follow-up after surgery. In all, 704 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included in the final analysis. Recovery was defined as self-reported erection sufficient for intercourse (ESI) with or without usage of erectile aids. Main Outcome Measures: Subjective reporting of erectile function and usage erectile aids 12 months <b>after</b> <b>RP.</b> Results: ESI with or without erectile aids was reported by 226 men (32. 1 %), among whom 109 (48. 2 %) required erectile aids. Erectile dysfunction (ED) was reported by 478 men (67. 9 %) and by 121 (25. 3 %) despite use of erectile aids. Of men with ED, 155 (22 %) stated not being interested in penile rehabilitation, 26 (3. 7 %) stated not having resumed their sex life 12 months <b>after</b> <b>RP,</b> and 241 (34. 2 %) had ED and were unsatisfied with the condition. We found that 134 of 445 men (30. 1 %) who underwent non–nerve-sparing RP had ESI 12 months <b>after</b> <b>RP.</b> Age older than 60. 5 years, a high body mass index, comorbidity, and a high American Society of Anesthesiologists score were negative predictors of erectile function 12 months <b>after</b> <b>RP.</b> Conclusion: Twelve months <b>after</b> <b>RP,</b> 32. 1 % of men had ESI; half these men required the use of erectile aids.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the insertion of}} a urethral sling {{at the time of}} radical prostatectomy (RP) in men at high risk of urinary incontinence <b>after</b> <b>RP.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS Between 1998 and 2000, 49 of 871 men undergoing RP at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, were identified as at risk of urinary incontinence <b>after</b> <b>RP,</b> based on their age (> 65 [*]years), previous transurethral resection of the prostate, previous radiation therapy, clinical stage, and obesity (body mass index of ≥  30 [*]kg/m 2). These 49 men had a suburethral sling inserted at the time of RP, and incontinence after surgery was evaluated using pad counts and patient-completed questionnaires. Retrospectively, incontinence rates and complications in these men were compared with 122 men also at high risk of urinary incontinence <b>after</b> <b>RP</b> who did not have a sling inserted at the time of RP (control group). RESULTS In all, 29 of 49 men (59 %) with a suburethral sling reported using either no pad or one pad per day for urinary leakage at 6 [*]months <b>after</b> <b>RP,</b> compared with 83 of 118 (70 %) in the control group.

We evaluated the relative merit of established preoperative factors, including biopsy indices and preoper-ative PSAV, for their impact on relapse <b>after</b> <b>RP.</b> Patients and Methods The outcomes of 202 men who underwent RP were reviewed. Biopsies were characterized for grade, percentage positive cores, and total linear tumor length. Surgical specimens were characterized for cancer volume, relative percentage by grade, extracapsular extension, and margin status. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with respect to relapse-free survival <b>after</b> <b>RP.</b> Results Thirty-one patients relapsed <b>after</b> <b>RP</b> (defined as PSA 0. 2 ng/mL), with a median time to failure of 16 months. Median follow-up was 48 months. Kaplan-Meier relapse-free survival at 5 years was 89 %, compared with 73 % for PSAV 2 v 2 ng/mL/year (P. 003). On multivariate analysis, only the biopsy Gleason sum (P. 008; relative risk, 4. 8) and the preoperative PSAV (P. 04; relative risk, 3. 0 to 4. 7) remained significant. Patients with a PSAV of 2 ng/mL/year {{were more likely to}} be pT 3 (P. 007), have positive margins (P. 01), have tumors 1 mL (P. 05), and possess 10 % grade 4 / 5 tumors (P. 04).

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the current}} study, the authors propose the {{quantitative}} Gleason score (qGS), {{a modification of}} the current Gleason grading system for prostate cancer, based on the weighted average of Gleason patterns present in the pathology specimen. They hypothesize that the qGS can improve prostate cancer risk stratification and help prevent the overtreatment of patients with clinically indolent tumors. METHODS: The qGS was applied to patients in the University of California San Francisco urologic oncology database with tumors determined to have a GS of 7 on prostate biopsy or final pathology after radical prostatectomy (RP). Using multivariable logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and decision curve analyses, the ability of qGS to predict pathological GS {{and the risk of}} disease recurrence <b>after</b> <b>RP</b> was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 225 men were included in the analysis of biopsy specimens and 618 men were included in the assessment of RP specimens. Compared with traditional Gleason scoring, the qGS improved concordance between biopsy and pathological GS on decision curve and ROC analyses (area under the curve ROC curve, 0. 79 vs 0. 71). On regression analysis, the qGS of biopsy specimens was found to be significantly associated with pathological grade <b>after</b> <b>RP</b> (hazard ratio [HR], 1. 78; 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 1. 49 - 2. 12) and the qGS of RP specimens was significantly associated with the risk of biochemical disease recurrence <b>after</b> <b>RP</b> (HR, 1. 13; 95 % CI, 1. 04 - 1. 24). CONCLUSIONS: The qGS, a simple modification of the current Gleason system, appears to improve the correlation between biopsy and pathological GS, as well as the prediction of biochemical disease recurrence <b>after</b> <b>RP.</b> This scoring system may allow more men to pursue active surveillance, thereby avoiding the morbidity of prostate cancer treatment modalities. © 2012 American Cancer Society...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to prospectively evaluate the changes in serum testosterone (Te), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the early months <b>after</b> <b>RP</b> for PCa and the correlation between these hormones at various follow-up times. A total of 100 male patients with clinically localized PCa were consecutively included in the study. The serum levels of Te, LH and FSH were measured prior to RP (baseline) and at 1 and 3 months post-operatively. Changes in the levels of Te, LH and FSH between the baseline and at 1 and 3 months <b>after</b> <b>RP</b> were analyzed with paired sample t-tests. The correlations between LH and Te levels at the various follow-up times were evaluated with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. At 1 month subsequent to RP, the Te levels were significantly decreased (baseline vs. 1 month, P= 0. 021) and subsequently recovered to the pre-operative value at 3 months (baseline vs. 3 months, P= 0. 372). The mean Te level at baseline was 15. 3 nmol/l, while at 1 and 3 months it was 13. 8 and 14. 4 nmol/l, respectively. By contrast, the levels of LH and FSH were significantly increased at 1 and 3 months post-surgery, compared with the baseline value (baseline vs. 1 or 3 months, P< 0. 0001).

Patients were assessed preoperatively with the American Urological Association symptom Score, Urinary flow rate measurements (Qmax and Qavg) as well as prostate volumes by transabdominal ultrasound. The amount of tissue resected was weighted. RPWR was derived by dividing the weight afterTURP by the initial weight. Clinical outcome was evaluated by the difference in AUA score, Qmax and Qavg before and 2 months after Surgery. Results: There was a significant improvement in AUA score, Qmax and Qavg postoperatively. Maximum numbers of patients undergoing TURP had RPWR in the range of 51 - 60 % (mean RPWR 49. 9 %). Mean overall change in AUA Score (DAUA), D Qmax and D Qavg was 12. 04, 8. 27 ml/sec and 6. 64 ml/sec respectively. Smaller the RPWR larger is the DAUA, DQmax, DQavg and vice versa.

SF and SB outcomes, measured using the University of California Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index, were assessed at 6 -month intervals for 4 years <b>after</b> <b>RP.</b> RESULTS In all, 620 men met the study criteria; at 6 months <b>after</b> <b>RP,</b> overall and all the specific domains of SF declined, with improvement in most specific domains by 2 years <b>after</b> <b>RP.</b> The greatest declines were {{in the ability to}} achieve erections, high-quality erections, and frequent erections; these domains were also most strongly correlated with overall SF. Sexual desire was relatively preserved, and there was a weak correlation between overall SF and sexual desire <b>after</b> <b>RP,</b> when there was the greatest discrepancy between sexual desire and other domains of function. SB showed continued improvement over time to 4 years but was not well correlated with any measurements of SF assessed. Younger age, college education, sexual aid and medication use, the absence of comorbid conditions, and nerve-sparing surgery were predictive of significant recovery of function in several specific domains of SF. CONCLUSIONS RP affects specific domains of SF to differing degrees. Compromised erectile function is most commonly reported among these specific domains and seems to play a more dominant role in determining overall SF, but notably none of the domains of function were closely linked to SB. Because education is protective in the perception of bother, appropriate counselling and the setting of expectations for outcomes in overall and specific domains of SF might lead to improved quality of life after treatment for prostate cancer. © 2010 BJU INTERNATIONAL...|$|E
40|$|Purpose/Objective(s) : Image {{guidance}} (IG) may permit higher radiotherapy (RT) doses (3 ̆e 65 Gy) <b>after</b> radical prostatectomy (<b>RP)</b> without increased toxicity, {{with improved}} accuracy and smaller margins. Conebeam (CBCT) allows IGRT with volumetric images. This study evaluated CBCT shifts and toxicity after conformal IGRT, compared to RT with port films.

Rithet (<b>after</b> {{whom the}} <b>R.P.</b> Rithet sternwheeler was named) built a large dock {{facility}} near Shoal Point, {{known as the}} Outer Wharves, which was initially used for sugar warehousing. After {{the construction of the}} Empress Hotel in 1908 the Outer Wharves started to land more passenger vessels. In 1975 the Outer Wharves were demolished and construction began on a new Canadian Coast Guard station that opened in 1980.|$|R
