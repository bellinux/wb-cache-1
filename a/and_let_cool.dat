For by such a Power they will range themselves uniformly, and without it they will float irregularly, and come together as irregularly. And since the Particles of Island-Crystal act all the same way upon the Rays of Light for causing the unusual Refraction, may it not be supposed that in the Formation of this Crystal, the Particles not only ranged themselves in rank and file for concreting in regular Figures, but also by some kind of polar Virtue turned their homogeneal Sides the same way.|$|E

40|$|In a first experiment, a reactively {{sputtered}} amorphous Ta_ 42 Si_ 13 N_ 45 {{film about}} 260 nm thick deposited {{on a flat}} and smooth alumina substrate was thermally annealed in air for 30 min <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>cooled</b> again repeatedly at successively higher temperatures from 200 to 500 °C. This treatment successively and irreversibly increases the room temperature resistivity of the film monotonically from its initial value of 670 μΩ cm {{to a maximum of}} 705 μΩ cm (+ 5. 2 %). Subsequent heat treatments at temperatures below 500 °C and up to 6 h have no further effect on the room temperature resistivity. The new value remains unchanged after 3. 8 years of storage at room temperature. In a second experiment, the evolution of the initially compressive stress of a film similarly deposited by reactive sputtering on a 2 -inch silicon wafer was measured by tracking the wafer curvature during similar thermal annealing cycles. A similar pattern of irreversible and reversible changes of stress was observed as for the film resistivity. Transmission electron micrographs and secondary ion mass profiles of the film taken before and after thermal annealing in air establish that both the structure and the composition of the film scarcely change during the annealing cycles. We reason that the film stress is implicated in the resistivity change. In particular, to interpret the observations, a model is proposed where the interface between the film and the substrate is mechanically unyielding...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Detailed {{information}} on the physical parameters in the sources of cosmological Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is obtained from few plausible assumptions consistent with observations. We consider monoenergetic injection of electrons <b>and</b> <b>let</b> them <b>cool</b> self-consistently, taking into account Klein-Nishina cut-off in electron-photon scattering. The general requirements posed by the assumptions on the emission mechanism in GRBs are formulated. It is found that the observed radiation in the sub-MeV energy range is generated by the synchrotron emission mechanism, though about ten per cent of the total GRB energy should be converted via the inverse Compton (IC) process into the ultra-hard spectral domain (above 100 GeV). We estimate the magnetic field strength in the emitting region, the Lorentz factor of accelerated electrons, and th...|$|R

This is repeated until the desired pattern thickness is reached. Another method involves filling the entire mould with molten wax <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> it <b>cool</b> as a solid object.If a core is required, there are two options: soluble wax or ceramic.

Saltpetre exists in the ashes of many plants, of which tobacco is one; it is also found copiously {{on the ground in}} many places, in saltpans, or simply as an effloresence. Rubbish, such as old mud huts, and mortar, generally abounds with it. (It is made by the action of the air on the potash contained in the earths.) The taste, which is that of gunpowder, is the best test of its presence. To extract it, pour hot water on the mass, then evaporate and purify, as mentioned above.|$|R
