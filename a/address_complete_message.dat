25|$|Drawbacks of block {{interleaver}} : As it {{is clear}} from the figure, the columns are read sequentially, the receiver can interpret single row only after it receives <b>complete</b> <b>message</b> and not before that. Also, the receiver requires a considerable amount of memory in order to store the received symbols and has to store the <b>complete</b> <b>message.</b> Thus, these factors give rise to two drawbacks, one is the latency and other is the storage (fairly large amount of memory). These drawbacks can be avoided by using the convolutional interleaver described below.|$|R
30|$|The {{next phase}} of the LBAOMDV {{protocol}} ensures actual data transfer over the qualified multiple channels. A <b>complete</b> <b>message</b> is divided into fixed-sized chunks which are transferred over the multiple qualified paths. A successful data transfer of a <b>complete</b> <b>message</b> {{will result in the}} end of the LBAOMDV protocol process. An unsuccessful data transfer due to path breakdown will require that the failed data chunk be retransferred. This retransfer of data will be treated as a new message and will be distributed across all the K− 1 available channels.|$|R

50|$|In the {{simplest}} implementation the verifier sends a random message {{as large as}} the device's memory to the device, which is expected to store it. After the device has received the <b>complete</b> <b>message,</b> it is required to send it back. Security of this approach is obvious, but it includes transfer of a huge amount of data (twice the size of the device's memory).|$|R
5000|$|Created at MIT, {{as part of}} Project Athena, Zephyr was {{designed}} as an instant messaging protocol and application-suite with a heavy Unix background. Using the [...] "do one thing, do it well" [...] philosophy of Unix, it {{was made up of}} several separate programs working together to make a <b>complete</b> <b>messaging</b> system. Zephyr and IRC are the first widely used IP-based instant-messaging systems.|$|R
50|$|Each GPS {{satellite}} continuously broadcasts a navigation {{message on}} L1 (C/A and P/Y) and L2 (P/Y) frequencies {{at a rate}} of 50 bits per second (see bitrate). Each <b>complete</b> <b>message</b> takes 750 seconds (12 1/2 minutes) to <b>complete.</b> The <b>message</b> structure has a basic format of a 1500-bit-long frame made up of five subframes, each subframe being 300 bits (6 seconds) long. Subframes 4 and 5 are subcommutated 25 times each, so that a <b>complete</b> data <b>message</b> requires the transmission of 25 full frames. Each subframe consists of ten words, each 30 bits long. Thus, with 300 bits in a subframe times 5 subframes in a frame times 25 frames in a message, each message is 37,500 bits long. At a transmission rate of 50-bit/s, this gives 750 seconds to transmit an entire almanac message (GPS). Each 30-second frame begins precisely on the minute or half-minute as indicated by the atomic clock on each satellite.|$|R

50|$|A sūtra is {{different}} from other components such as Shlokas, Anuvyakhayas and Vyakhyas found in ancient Indian literature. A sūtra is a condensed rule which succinctly states the message, while a Shloka is a verse that conveys the <b>complete</b> <b>message</b> and is structured to certain rules of musical meter, a Anuvyakhaya is {{an explanation of the}} reviewed text, while a Vyakhya is a comment by the reviewer.|$|R
50|$|Ciphering is a radio {{resource}} function and managed with messages in the {{radio resource}} sublayer of L3, but ciphering is tied to authentication because the ciphering key Kc is generated in that process. Ciphering is initiated with the RR Ciphering Mode Command message, which indicates the A5 variant to be used. The MS starts ciphering and responds with the RR Ciphering Mode <b>Complete</b> <b>message</b> in ciphertext.|$|R
50|$|Recently, {{anonymous}} networking {{has been}} used to secure communications. In principle, a large number of users running the same system, can have communications routed between them {{in such a way that}} it is very hard to detect what any <b>complete</b> <b>message</b> is, which user sent it, and where it is ultimately going from or to. Examples are Crowds, Tor, I2P, Mixminion, various anonymous P2P networks, and others.|$|R
50|$|ISO 15765-2, or ISO-TP (Transport Layer), is an {{international}} standard for sending data packets over a CAN-Bus. The protocol allows for the transport of messages that exceed the eight byte maximum payload of CAN frames. ISO-TP segments longer messages into multiple frames, adding metadata that allows the interpretation of individual frames and reassembly into a <b>complete</b> <b>message</b> packet by the recipient. It can carry up to 4095 bytes of payload per message packet.|$|R

30|$|As {{soon as the}} DMR {{receives}} the RRC reconfiguration message, the device detaches from S-DeNB. Further, it uses the configuration details to synchronize with the T-DeNB by sending contention-free-based random access preamble message. At the same time, the S-DeNB forwards the buffered data and status transfer command to T-DeNB. Once successfully synchronized, the DMR sends a tracking area update to MME along with RRC connection configuration <b>complete</b> <b>message.</b> This will establish the uplink communication between DMR and T-DeNB.|$|R
50|$|On the resin strap of the Timex Datalink 50 model 70301, {{there is}} a print with binary numbers which are {{actually}} ASCII. The numbers on {{one half of the}} strap encode, including capitalization, the text 'Listen To The Light'. The numbers on other half of the strap encode the text 'If You ASCII-24 See', which, given that ASCII-24 is the 'Cancel' character or just 'CAN', makes the <b>complete</b> <b>message</b> 'Listen To The Light If You Can See'.|$|R
50|$|Request-response, or request-reply, {{is one of}} {{the basic}} methods {{computers}} use to communicate with each other, in which the first computer sends a request for some data and the second computer responds to the request. Usually, there is a series of such interchanges until the <b>complete</b> <b>message</b> is sent; browsing a web page is an example of request-response communication. Request-response {{can be seen as a}} telephone call, in which someone is called and they answer the call.|$|R

50|$|Heymann said {{investigators}} {{worked with}} Harvard {{so they could}} track an intruder without violating users' privacy. He said the compromised Harvard network comprised 16,500 accounts and 13,000 users, sending out about 60,000 email messages daily. Investigators, he explained used a high-speed computer to sift through messages, focusing on 10 to 15 keywords that matched the suspect's profile. According to Heymann, investigators believed {{there were only two}} instances in which they had read a <b>complete</b> <b>message</b> that did not come from Ardita.|$|R

Obi-Wan and Luke hire smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee first mate Chewbacca to transport them to Alderaan on Han's ship, the Millennium Falcon.|$|R
50|$|The {{call control}} (CC) {{protocol}} {{is one of}} the protocols of the Connection Management (CM) sublayer. Every mobile station must support the call control protocol. If a mobile station does not support any bearer capability at all then it must respond to a SETUP message with a RELEASE <b>COMPLETE</b> <b>message.</b> In the call control protocol, more than one CC entity are defined. Each CC entity is independent from each other and communicates with the correspondent peer entity using its own MM connection. Different CC entities use different transaction identifiers.|$|R

In 1901, the first west to east wireless message was sent across the Atlantic Ocean to England from this site.
