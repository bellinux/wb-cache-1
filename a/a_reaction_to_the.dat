5|$|Carpenter {{wrote the}} film in the mid-1970s as <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Watergate scandal. After the success of Halloween, he had enough {{influence}} to begin production and filmed it mainly in St. Louis, Missouri on an estimated budget of $6 million. Debra Hill and Larry J. Franco served as the producers. The film was co-written by Nick Castle, who had collaborated with Carpenter by portraying Michael Myers in Halloween.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{jurisprudence}} signifies <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> philosophical {{approach of}} modern legal scholars, who typically see {{law as a}} process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals. Feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women's values or legal interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience.|$|E
5|$|For Nigel Strudwick, {{the reforms}} of Djedkare Isesi were {{undertaken}} as <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{rapid growth of}} the central administration {{in the first part}} of the Fifth Dynasty which, Baer adds, had amassed too much political or economic power in the eyes of the king.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, {{widespread}} protests {{erupted in}} many Turkish provinces, sparked by {{a plan to}} demolish Gezi Park but soon growing into general anti-government dissent.

As <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> failed coup d'état, the government is currently carrying out mass purges.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Sratsimir was proclaimed emperor in Vidin in 1356 {{and began}} to use the title Emperor of Bulgarians and Greeks, as his father. In order to secure the {{alliance}} of Wallachia, he married his first cousin Anna, {{the daughter of the}} Wallachian voivode Nicholas Alexander, in 1356 or 1357, a move that was probably arranged with the help of Ivan Sratsimir's mother Theodora as <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> actions of Ivan Alexander.|$|E

5|$|This {{dedication}} to reading and study might, in another boy, have been {{nothing more than}} <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> impending examinations — but not in Jan's case. What made this particular episode revealing was that the books found under his bedclothes were largely unconnected with his studies. In Riebeek West he developed a lifelong habit, that of reading avidly outside the prescribed curriculum, seeking knowledge for its own sake.|$|E
5|$|According to the synoptics, {{the arrest}} of Jesus was <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{cleansing}} of the temple, while according to John it was triggered by the raising of Lazarus. The Pharisees, portrayed as more uniformly legalistic and opposed to Jesus in the synoptic gospels, are instead portrayed as sharply divided; they debate frequently in John's accounts. Some, such as Nicodemus, even {{go so far as}} to be at least partially sympathetic to Jesus. This is believed to be a more accurate historical depiction of the Pharisees, who made debate one of the tenets of their system of belief.|$|E
5|$|Behaviorism {{dominated}} {{philosophy of}} mind {{for much of}} the 20th century, especially the first half. In psychology, behaviorism developed as <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inadequacies of introspectionism. Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations. Without generalizability and the possibility of third-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be scientific. The way out, therefore, was to eliminate the idea of an interior mental life (and hence an ontologically independent mind) altogether and focus instead on the description of observable behavior.|$|E

5|$|Development lasted three years, {{involving}} {{a team of}} thirteen people. Several members, including director Matt Nava and composer Austin Wintory, had previously worked on the 2012 video game Journey—the ocean setting of Abzû was both <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> desert setting of Journey and inspired by Nava's love of scuba diving. The setting and story drew from Sumerian mythology and the cosmic ocean myth. Reaching high positions in sales charts, Abzû was praised by journalists: the majority of praise went to its art style, with some critics comparing it to Journey.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} ships' careers, {{they were}} {{assigned}} to the main Italian fleet, where they were frequently occupied with conducting training exercises. These exercises frequently gamed attacks by the French fleet, such as the maneuvers conducted in 1893, which simulated a French attack on Naples. In 1895, Partenope joined a squadron that visited Great Britain, and later that year took part in an international naval demonstration off Crete in an attempt to defuse tensions between Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Euridice took part in a similar demonstration, again off Crete, in 1897; this was <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Greco-Turkish War that had broken out that year. Between 1906 and 1908, Partenope was converted into a minelayer, and Minerva underwent a similar conversion in 19091910. Two ships, Calatafimi and Euridice, were discarded in early 1907.|$|E
5|$|Functionalism was {{formulated}} by Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor as <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inadequacies {{of the identity}} theory. Putnam and Fodor saw mental states {{in terms of an}} empirical computational theory of the mind. At about the same time or slightly after, D.M. Armstrong and David Kellogg Lewis formulated a version of functionalism that analyzed the mental concepts of folk psychology in terms of functional roles. Finally, Wittgenstein's idea of meaning as use led to a version of functionalism as a theory of meaning, further developed by Wilfrid Sellars and Gilbert Harman. Another one, psychofunctionalism, is an approach adopted by the naturalistic philosophy of mind associated with Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn.|$|E
40|$|Forty-one {{children}} {{suspected of}} having tuberculosis were simultaneously given an intermediate strength Mantoux test, an old tuberculin tine test (OT), and a purified protein derivative (PPD) tine test. Each test was read at 48 hours, and the largest diameter of induration was recorded. Twenty-nine patients had <b>a</b> positive <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mantoux test, 20 patients had <b>a</b> positive <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> OT tine test, and 16 patients had <b>a</b> positive <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> PPD-tine test. There were seven instances of <b>a</b> doubtful <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> OT tine test and nine <b>to</b> <b>the</b> PPD-tine test. Two children with positive Mantoux tests had negative OT tine tests, and four with positive Mantoux tests had negative PPD-tine test <b>reactions.</b> There was <b>a</b> {{significant difference between the}} number of positive reactors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mantoux test and both tine tests. If all tine test reactions of 2 mm or more were considered positive (doubtful plus positive reactors), {{there was no significant difference}} between any of the tuber-culin tests. All suggestively positive tine reactors should, therefore, be retested with a Mantoux test to avoid false-negative interpretation of the tines...|$|R

5|$|The Finnish labor movement, {{which emerged}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century from temperance, {{religious}} movements and Fennomania, had a Finnish nationalist, working-class character. From 1899–1906 the movement became conclusively independent, shedding the patronizing thinking of the Fennoman estates, and it was represented by the Finnish Social Democratic Party, established in 1899. Workers' activism directed both toward opposing Russification and in developing a domestic policy that tackled social problems and responded to the demand for democracy. This was <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> domestic dispute, ongoing since the 1880s, between the Finnish nobility-burghers and the labor movement concerning voting rights for the common people.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Sleepy Hollows 150 visual effects shots were handled by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), while Kevin Yagher supervised {{the human and}} creature effects. Framestore also assisted on digital effects, and The Mill handled motion control photography. In part <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> computer-generated effects in Mars Attacks!, Burton opted to use as limited an amount of digital effects as possible. Ray Park, {{who served as the}} Headless Horseman stunt double, wore a blue ski mask for the chroma key effect, digitally removed by ILM. Burton and Heinrichs applied to Sleepy Hollow many of the techniques they had used in stop motion animation on Vincent—such as forced perspective sets.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the mid-1950s}} in Britain the blues {{was seen as}} a form of folk music. When Broonzy toured England he played a folk blues set to fit British {{expectations}} of American blues, rather than his current electric Chicago blues. Skiffle clubs included the ‘Ballad and Blues’ club in a pub in Soho, co-founded by Ewan MacColl. In its early stages these clubs saw the playing of British and American folk music that included folk blues. As the skiffle craze subsided from the mid-1950s many of these clubs, following the lead of MacColl, began to shift towards the performance of English traditional folk material, partly as <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> growth of American dominated pop and rock n’ roll music, often banning American music from performances and became more exclusively English folk clubs.|$|E

5|$|Willie Hugh Nelson (born April 29, 1933) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, author, poet, actor, and activist. The {{critical}} {{success of}} the album Shotgun Willie (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of Red Headed Stranger (1975) and Stardust (1978), made Nelson {{one of the most}} recognized artists in country music. He {{was one of the main}} figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana.|$|E
5|$|Architectural {{evidence}} suggests that, while the Romanesque style peaked {{in much of}} Europe in the later eleventh and early twelfth century, it was still reaching Scotland {{in the second half}} of the twelfth century and was revived in the late fifteenth century, perhaps as <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English perpendicular style that had come to dominate. Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, a small number of significant crafted items have also survived and, for the end of the period, there is evidence of painting, particularly the extensive commissioning of works in the Low Countries and France.|$|E

He {{undergoes}} surgery and the flirts with nurse Will Dempier (Christian Heath) when he suffers <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> analgesic. Chris becomes frustrated when Hudson {{is not there}} for him, and questions how he can be in a relationship and feel so alone. He decides to ask Will out for a drink, but later cancels. Chris collapses due to complications from his surgery and is readmitted to hospital. He apologises to Will for cancelling on him and then tells him about Hudson. During Chris's next visit to Hudson, he appears distracted and when Hudson asks him if he is seeing someone else, Chris hesitates and Hudson breaks up with him. Chris tells Hudson about Will and how lonely he is. Hudson does not want Chris to date him out of guilt, and they say goodbye. Chris spends some time with Will and they begin dating, but the relationship ends when Will's dog, Napoleon, bites Kyle's dog Bossy, and Will refuses to accept responsibility or apologise.|$|E
