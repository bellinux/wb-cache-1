5|$|American Beauty is a 1999 American drama film {{directed}} by Sam Mendes and written by Alan Ball. Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, a 42-year-old advertising executive who has <b>a</b> <b>midlife</b> crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). Annette Bening co-stars as Lester's materialistic wife, Carolyn, and Thora Birch plays their insecure daughter, Jane. Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, and Allison Janney also feature. The film {{is described by}} academics as a satire of American middle-class notions of beauty and personal satisfaction; analysis {{has focused on the}} film's explorations of romantic, and paternal love, sexuality, beauty, materialism, self-liberation, and redemption.|$|E

Hindustan Shipyard with almost zero experience in the field was chosen due to political wrangling against the wishes of the navy staff.|$|E

Finally the friction becomes enough that Beth decides to leave him at the novel's conclusion. Father and son, however, have closed the gap between them.|$|E

25|$|Miller {{found the}} play revelatory, {{and they went}} {{backstage}} to meet Osborne. Olivier {{was impressed by the}} American's reaction, and asked Osborne for a part in his next play. John Heilpern suggests the great actor's about-face was due to <b>a</b> <b>midlife</b> crisis, Olivier seeking a new challenge after decades of success in Shakespeare and other classics, and fearful of losing his pre-eminence to this new kind of theatre. George Devine, artistic director of the Royal Court, sent Olivier the incomplete script of The Entertainer (1957, film version released in 1960) and Olivier initially wanted to play Billy Rice, the lead character's decent elderly father. On seeing the finished script, he changed his mind and took the central role as failing music-hall performer Archie Rice, playing to great acclaim both at the Royal Court and then in the West End.|$|E

[...] He {{observed}} that [...] "too often, [...] falls into American culture's Disney syndrome, idealizing childhood innocence above all." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C, saying that while No Code [...] "cracks open their sound," [...] it [...] "becomes a collection of fragments that don't add up to much of anything, except {{a portrait of a}} musically disjointed band." [...] On the change in mood compared with the band’s previous releases, he said that [...] "the album leaves you with the vaguely unsettling feeling that Pearl Jam without pain are like a pretzel without salt, or Seattle without rain." [...] Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork called it [...] "a nice listen," [...] but stated that [...] "there's a ton of filler here. In fact, it's almost all filler." [...] Time reviewer Christopher John Farley said that the album [...] "makes it sound as if they're having <b>a</b> <b>midlife</b> crisis." [...] Farley added that [...] "too few of {{the songs on}} the Pearl Jam CD explore the musical possibilities they suggest in any kind of definitive or provocative manner." ...|$|E

And {{when you start to}} think about death, you start to think about what's after it. And then you start hoping there is a God. For me, it's a frightening thought to go nowhere.

One, I suppose, is that there are different levels of reconciliation, in troubled families and beleaguered businesses as well as in nations beset by permanent crisis. A more important one, perhaps, is that there's a difference between dropping out and running away." ...|$|R
