5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria joined OPEC and the huge oil {{revenues}} it was generating enriched the economy. Despite these revenues, the military government did little to improve {{the standard of living}} of the population, help small and medium businesses, or invest in infrastructure. <b>As</b> <b>oil</b> revenues fueled the rise of federal subsidies to states, the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country. <b>As</b> <b>oil</b> production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and on international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns. It did not develop alternate revenue sources in the economy for economic stability. That spelled doom to federalism in Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{the vast}} Prudhoe Bay Oil Field was {{discovered}} in Alaska's North Slope. Fairbanks became a supply point for exploitation of the oil field and for construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which caused a boom unseen since {{the first years of}} Fairbanks' founding and helped the town recover from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood. Fairbanks became a government center in the late 1960s with the establishment of the Fairbanks North Star Borough, which took Fairbanks as its borough seat. A drop in oil prices during the 1980s caused a recession in the Fairbanks area, but the city gradually recovered <b>as</b> <b>oil</b> prices climbed during the 1990s. Tourism also became an important factor in Fairbanks' economy, and the growth of the tourism industry and the city continues even <b>as</b> <b>oil</b> production declines.|$|E

5|$|Vegetable oils are {{triglycerides}} {{extracted from}} plants. Such <b>as</b> <b>oils</b> {{have been part}} of human culture for millennia.

Some of the many other uses include wood finishing, oil painting, and skin care.|$|R
5|$|After Reagan's {{military}} buildup, the Soviet Union did {{not respond}} by further building its military because the enormous military expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture, were already a heavy burden for the Soviet economy. At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production. These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union, <b>as</b> <b>oil</b> was {{the main source of}} Soviet export revenues. Issues with command economics, oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>oil</b> {{prices rose}} during the 1990s, Fairbanks' economy improved. The city was also boosted by the {{regrowth}} of gold mining in the area. The Fort Knox Gold Mine north of Fairbanks opened in 1997 {{after several years}} of development, and another gold prospect is likely to be developed in the next decade. The same year that Fort Knox Mine opened, Alyeska moved 300 jobs from Anchorage to Fairbanks, making the city the base of its operations {{for the first time in}} several decades.|$|E
5|$|Biofuels, in {{the form}} of liquid fuels derived from plant materials, are {{entering}} the market, driven by factors such <b>as</b> <b>oil</b> price spikes and the need for increased energy security.

5|$|By 1942, {{there were}} {{proposals}} for completely buried flame fougasses {{to be used}} <b>as</b> <b>oil</b> mines but by then the emergency was over. Almost all flame fougasses were removed {{before the end of}} the war and in most instances even the slightest traces of their original locations have disappeared. A few instances were missed, and their remains have been found. For example, the rusty remnants of a four-barrel battery, one of which still contained an oily residue, were discovered in 2010 in West Sussex.|$|E
5|$|Contaminants {{that are}} {{discharged}} into {{the marine environment}} accumulate in the bodies of marine mammals when they are stored unintentionally in their blubber along with energy. Contaminants that {{are found in the}} tissues of marine mammals include heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, but also organochlorides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For example, these can cause disruptive effects on endocrine systems; impair the reproductive system, and lower the immune system of individuals, leading to a higher number of deaths. Other pollutants such <b>as</b> <b>oil,</b> plastic debris and sewage threaten the livelihood of marine mammals.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that deep fryers be cleaned often to prevent contamination. The process of cooking with oil can also contaminate nearby surfaces <b>as</b> <b>oil</b> may splatter on adjacent areas. Oil vapors can also condense on more distant surfaces such as walls and ceilings. Supplies such as dish detergent and baking soda can effectively clean affected surfaces.|$|E

5|$|There {{are large}} {{deposits}} of petroleum (<b>as</b> <b>oil</b> and natural gas) in rocks beneath the seabed. Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore {{oil and gas}} production can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales. Toxic substances such as mercury, lead, and arsenic may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage and oil may be spilt.|$|E

5|$|An {{elaborate}} bureaucracy {{was created}} to regulate German imports of raw materials and finished goods {{with the intention of}} eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such <b>as</b> <b>oil</b> and textiles. As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would {{be turned over to the}} Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>oil</b> {{production}} increased {{through the}} success of wells like the Frazier, Twin, Pool, Grant, and the two Homestead Wells, transportation of the oil {{to the outside world}} was still reliant on teamsters. The teamsters were notorious for mistreatment of their horses, most of which lost their hair due to a buildup of oil and only had a lifespan of a few months in Pithole. The high mortality rate caused a horse shortage, with more having to be brought in by rail from Ohio and New York. Teamsters often refused to work on days when the roads were impassable or gouged the oil producers.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying (also {{referred}} to as deep fat frying) is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, rather than the shallow oil used in conventional frying, done in a frying pan. Normally, a deep fryer or chip pan is used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used. Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot. Deep frying is classified as hot-fat cooking method. Typically, deep frying foods cook quickly: all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously <b>as</b> <b>oil</b> has {{a high rate of}} heat conduction.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, {{sea otter}} numbers rebounded in {{about two-thirds of}} their {{historic}} range, a recovery {{considered one of the}} greatest successes in marine conservation. However, the IUCN still lists the sea otter as an endangered species, and describes the significant threats to sea otters <b>as</b> <b>oil</b> pollution, predation by orcas, poaching, and conflicts with fisheries– sea otters can drown if entangled in fishing gear. The hunting of sea otters is no longer legal except for limited harvests by indigenous peoples in the United States.
