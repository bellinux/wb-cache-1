5|$|The {{achievement}} of <b>a</b> <b>convoy</b> <b>of</b> merchants not only escaping without loss from a French squadron, but {{going so far}} as to attack, drive off, and then pursue their would-be predators, was widely hailed as a signal victory.|$|E
5|$|After Cuba was taken, President William McKinley {{approved}} the land invasion of Puerto Rico {{by way of}} Fajardo, taking into consideration that the Spaniards had fortified San Juan, where they expected the initial attack. <b>A</b> <b>convoy</b> <b>of</b> ships left Tampa, Florida and on July 21 another convoy, which included the USS Yale, USS Massachusetts, USS Gloucester and the USS Dixie, departed from Guantánamo for a 4-day journey to Puerto Rico.|$|E

5|$|Early in June, Bridgeport made a round-trip {{voyage to}} Hampton Roads, Virginia, {{arriving}} back at New London on 23 June. She took on cargo and got underway on 28 June in <b>a</b> <b>convoy</b> <b>of</b> 18 subchasers and other vessels, bound for Europe {{by way of}} Bermuda and the Azores.

5|$|On 16 May 1794, {{the fleet}} {{departed}} from Brest {{with the mission}} of protecting <b>a</b> <b>convoy</b> <b>of</b> ships carrying food to France, beginning the Atlantic campaign of May 1794. On 1 June, the French squadron encountered the British fleet, in an engagement known as the Glorious First of June. Vengeur was third in the French line of battle, after the flagship Montagne and between Achille and Northumberland.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June 1952, the {{squadron}} {{was ordered to}} attack <b>a</b> <b>convoy</b> <b>of</b> Chinese vehicles. Overton, leading a group of 24 F-84s, directed attacks on the convoy despite taking intense anti-aircraft fire himself, and the aircraft destroyed 150 vehicles. Though the circumstances in the event were lost in subsequent actions, Overton would later be decorated for this achievement.|$|E
5|$|The {{flotilla}} {{was next}} in action {{during the night}} 29/30 July again off Ostend, when the flotilla in company with two Motor Torpedo Boats (MTB) engaged <b>a</b> <b>convoy</b> <b>of</b> three Flak trawlers and two merchant ships. One of the merchant ships was hit by torpedoes from the MTBs while the MGBs engaged the other by dropping depth charges. With those ships destroyed they then engaged the Flak trawlers.|$|E

5|$|After a {{full day}} of pursuit, the leading French ships made an attempt to cut off , {{trailing}} in the British rear. Cornwallis dropped back to support Mars, while Captain Robert Stopford of HMS Phaeton began making signals implying a British fleet was in sight. When French lookouts spotted distant topsails, Villaret de Joyeuse decided that Cornwallis's actions meant that a British fleet was approaching to support him, and called off the pursuit. There was no British fleet in the vicinity; the topsails were those of <b>a</b> <b>convoy</b> <b>of</b> British merchantmen.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane {{prepared}} for {{an encounter with}} this Spanish vessel by painting Speedy to resemble a Danish brig then in the Mediterranean, the Clomer. He also appointed a Dane as quartermaster and found him a Danish naval officer's uniform. While cruising off Alicante on 21 December, Speedy encountered an enemy frigate, but tricked her into thinking she was a neutral vessel. Cochrane again used this false flag technique to his advantage; on 22January he was sailing with <b>a</b> <b>convoy</b> <b>of</b> Danish merchantmen under a Danish flag, pretending to escort them. When a 10-gun French ship and 8-gun Spanish brig approached, Cochrane hoisted British colours and attacked, capturing both of them.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, New York {{joined the}} Neutrality Patrol, {{safeguarding}} sea lanes in the North Atlantic, {{and served as}} flagship with the Atlantic Squadron, later redesignated the United States Atlantic Fleet, for the next 27 months. In July 1941, she protected <b>a</b> <b>convoy</b> <b>of</b> U.S. troops moving to garrison Iceland. She saw another modernization in 1940–41 where her main battery elevation was increased from 15 to 30 degrees. She {{was in the midst}} of this refit on 7 December 1941, when the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor, sinking many of the battleships in the U.S. Pacific Fleet and bringing the United States into World War II.|$|E

5|$|Logan was {{appointed}} commander {{of what was}} designated the Samoa Expeditionary Force (SEF). By 11 August 1914, the SEF consisted of over 1,400 personnel including three companies of infantry and a company of field engineers. It departed New Zealand on 15 August in <b>a</b> <b>convoy</b> <b>of</b> troopships escorted by the cruisers Philomel, Pyramus and Psyche. After stopping at Nouméa in New Caledonia, where the convoy was joined by the battlecruiser HMAS Australia, the cruiser HMAS Melbourne and the French cruiser Montcalm, the SEF went on to Fiji. Here several Legion-of-Frontiersmen and Samoan chiefs joined the SEF and it then sailed for Samoa on 27 August.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{was ordered}} to take Levant back to sea immediately, departing Portsmouth on 27 July as escort to <b>a</b> <b>convoy</b> <b>of</b> {{merchant}} vessels bound for the Yorkshire port of Kingston upon Hull. The ageing frigate then briefly joined a small Navy squadron on patrol off Brighton before setting sail for the Spanish coast. On 5 August she {{took part in the}} recapture of a British merchant vessel, Nine Colliers. She was off Cadiz in October 1779 when she won her final victory of the war, capturing the 20-gun Spanish privateer Velenza de Alcantara along with 200 of her crew.|$|E
5|$|On {{her second}} voyage in early 1969, Manchester Challenge {{lived up to}} her name by {{entering}} the heavily iced Montreal harbour, discharging, reloading and departing only two days late. Another thirty-seven conventional vessels were stuck at the port for a month. The quartet's ice-breaking capability often resulted them in leading <b>a</b> <b>convoy</b> <b>of</b> other vessels into Montreal during the winter months. The four ships of 12,039 gross tons were of the maximum size able to navigate the Manchester Ship Canal.|$|E
50|$|During her career, U-707 sunk two ships, {{for a total}} tonnage of 11,811 GRT, {{namely the}} US {{freighter}} Jonathan Sturges, <b>a</b> straggler <b>of</b> <b>convoy</b> ON 166, and the British freighter North Britain also <b>a</b> straggler <b>of</b> <b>convoy</b> ONS 5.|$|R

Empire Crocus was <b>a</b> member <b>of</b> <b>Convoy</b> EBC 13, which departed Barry, Glamorgan on 16 June 1944 and arrived at the Seine Bay on 18 June. She left the convoy at Falmouth, Cornwall. On 7 July, she repeated the voyage as <b>a</b> member <b>of</b> <b>Convoy</b> EBC 34.

5|$|One {{result of}} the brigades' {{scattered}} landing was that several small groups of men caused havoc among the Germans, ambushing men and vehicles. One lone sergeant arrived at brigade headquarters with eighty prisoners, having convinced {{them that they were}} surrounded and should surrender. The 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion's 'B' Company, which had landed on the correct drop zone, ambushed <b>a</b> <b>convoy</b> <b>of</b> five trucks, killing twelve Germans, then assaulted a château, killing another thirty men before the surviving fifty surrendered.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 18 November 1809 was {{the most}} {{significant}} engagement of a six-month cruise by a French frigate squadron in the Indian Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars. The French commander, Commodore Jacques Hamelin, raided across the Bay of Bengal with his squadron and achieved local superiority, capturing numerous merchant ships and minor warships. On 18 November 1809, three ships of Hamelin's squadron encountered <b>a</b> <b>convoy</b> <b>of</b> India-bound East Indiamen, mainly carrying recruits for the Indian Army, then administered by the Honourable East India Company (HEIC).|$|E
5|$|The Indiamen {{were not}} unprotected: each one {{was large and}} powerfully built and carried a number of cannon. Streatham and Europe weighed over 800 tons each and carried 30 cannon, whereas the smaller Lord Keith was 600 tons and carried 12 guns. Four years earlier, <b>a</b> <b>convoy</b> <b>of</b> East Indiamen had driven off a French ship {{of the line and}} {{attached}} frigates under Admiral Linois in similar waters by forming a battle line and firing on their opponents as they closed. The crews of these East Indiamen were not of Royal Navy standard, however, with insufficient training and large numbers of Chinese and lascar seamen, who proved unreliable in combat.|$|E
