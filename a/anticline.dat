5|$|The {{watershed}} of Twomile Run runs {{in approximately}} {{the same direction as}} the nearby Clearfield-McIntyre Syncline. To the north of the Clearfield-McIntyre Syncline is the Wellsboro <b>Anticline</b> and to the south is the Hyner Dome. The Huling Branch valley is relatively straight and narrow.|$|E
5|$|East–west-directed {{compression}} from subduction off {{the west}} coast affected the area in later Mesozoic and early Tertiary time by folding and thrust faulting strata. Evidence for the Sevier Orogeny part of this period {{can be seen in}} the Taylor Creek area in the Kolob section of the park. Chunks of Moenave strata have been compressed to the point of thrusting themselves over the same formation in the Taylor Creek Thrust Fault Zone, located on the east flank of the Kanarra <b>anticline.</b>|$|E
40|$|The Zagros Fold-Thrust Belt, {{extending}} from southern Iran, through northern Iraq and into Turkey, {{is characterized by}} elongate NW-trending <b>anticlines</b> that house large hydrocarbon accumulations. In recent years, the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq has become an area of interest for both structural studies and petroleum exploration-related investigation. Key questions to be answered concern {{the nature of the}} <b>anticlines</b> and whether the geometry of any associated thrusts can be predicted from surface geomorphology, as well the 4 -D evolution of the area and along-strike continuity of the <b>anticlines.</b> To address these questions, this study combines field data, remote-sensing data concerning the structure and geomorphology of the <b>anticlines,</b> and structural modeling in order to produce robust interpretations of the geometries of the reverse fault structures that core the majority of these <b>anticlines.</b> Results indicate that this methodology can be used to constrain potential thrust configurations at depth and the probable style of fold amplification and lateral propagation. In addition, this study shows that the growth of the <b>anticlines</b> can be considered in 4 -D, with consideration given to the interaction of the Zagros-age deformation with the pre-existing basement fabric. We demonstrate that combining both structural and geomorphological methodologies can lead {{to a better understanding of}} the geometry and evolution of the trap-forming structures in the Kurdistan region of Iraq and thus is expected to be of interest to the petroleum industry...|$|R

5|$|The Old Red Sandstone is {{a series}} of red {{sandstone}}s, marls and conglomerates. It rises as an <b>anticline</b> in the Mendips and appears in the Avon Gorge and at Portishead. Carboniferous Limestone, of marine origin, covers the sandstone and appears in the Avon Gorge and at Weston-super-Mare where it contains volcanic rocks. There are outlying hills at Worlebury, Middle Hope, the Failand Ridge, Broadfields Down, Portishead Down and Wrington Hill.|$|E
5|$|These ore bodies {{formed in}} {{different}} places along a ring fault in the caldera. About 50 million years after they were deposited, the tectonic plate of which they were a part collided with another small plate {{and then with the}} proto-North American continent. The collisions, which welded the plates to the continent, folded the Cleopatra tuff {{in such a way that}} the two ore bodies ended up on opposite sides of a fold called the Jerome <b>anticline.</b>|$|E
5|$|Larrys Creek is in a sandstone, limestone, and shale {{mountain}} region, {{with the}} {{source in the}} dissected Allegheny Plateau and the mouth in the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. The {{southern part of the}} Larrys Creek watershed has sedimentary surface rocks from the Devonian period, with a large area from the Mississippian period in the north of the watershed and a small Pennsylvanian period region within this area. The Cogan House <b>anticline</b> runs north of and parallel to {{the upper part of the}} creek. Iron ore within the watershed was mined south of Salladasburg and along Canoe Run in the 19th century; there are also deposits on Puterbaugh Mountain.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} {{application}} of the HCA (hybrid cellular automata) numerical modeling technique to the evolution of compressional fault-bend <b>anticlines</b> involving layers that have competency contrasts and a mechanical stratigraphy. The new modeling results show that, for competent hanging-wall layers, (1) the fault style is not preserved in the overlying fold; (2) fold development is not self-similar, and rotational growth wedges develop in the forelimb when syntectonic sedimentation occurs; and (3) balanced fault-bend <b>anticlines</b> can develop for ramp cutoff angles as high as 60 °. These results compare favorably with field examples and laboratory analogues and dramatically broaden the applicability of fault- bend folding to model the evolution of thrust-related <b>anticlines...</b>|$|R

5|$|The earthquake's {{epicenter}} lay near Manhattan, Kansas, a town {{just off}} the connection of the Kansas River and the Big Blue River. Nearby is the <b>anticline</b> Nemaha Ridge, which {{has been associated with}} at least a few earthquakes of Kansas. A 300‑million-year-old Precambrian granite range bounded by faults, it hosts the Humboldt Fault Zone, which, in addition to serving as the range's easternmost boundary, has produced {{a large portion of the}} state's earthquakes. Each year, it is responsible for at least several small tremors less than magnitude 2.7. It cuts through Permian rock, and according to the Geological Society of America, may actually be a complex fault. Previously, it was believed to be a simple, Precambrian structure.|$|E
5|$|Uplift {{caused by}} a mountain-building episode called the Laramide orogeny lasted from the late Cretaceous around 70mya to the early Paleocene. This hoisted the once lower uplands skyward while low-lying basins between them {{gradually}} subsided. Compression from the Laramide event deformed the land {{in the area to}} form the up to 5° dipping Bryce Canyon <b>Anticline.</b> All of the Canaan Peak, Pine Hollow, Kaiparowits, and Waheap formations, along with part of the underlying Straight Cliffs, were removed from the anticline's crest by erosion before the Claron Formation was deposited. An angular unconformity therefore exists along the anticline's crest. The park also sits on the western gently dipping flank of the much larger Kaibab uplift, which was also formed {{as a result of the}} Laramide.|$|E
5|$|Yarralumla {{is located}} on the Yarralumla Formation which is a mudstone/siltstone {{formation}} that was formed around 425 million years ago during the Silurian Period. The formation extends from Red Hill and Woden in the South to Lake Burley Griffin in to the north, passing under the suburb of Yarralumla. The formation is evidence of the last major marine sedimentary period when eastern Australia was still covered by shallow seas. It shows fossil evidence of trilobites, coral and primitive crinoids. The Yarralumla brickworks quarry and the Deakin <b>anticline</b> are places where the formation is exposed and easily studied.|$|E
5000|$|The tectonic {{movements}} {{were much more}} complicated in the Southern Province, having superimposed on them very strong halokinetic motions (salt diapirism). A {{large part of the}} formed structures is concealed under Plio-Quaternary detritus. The many exploration wells drilled for hydrocarbons and groundwater helped immensely in unravelling these structures. Similar to the Northern Province, the major structures are again trains of parallel <b>anticlines</b> whose wavelength steadily diminishes approaching the Pyrenean front. Inversely the effects of the salt movements become stronger towards the south. The <b>anticlines</b> were formed during the uplift of the Pyrenees during the Eocene/Oligocene. The structures were set in place by Miocene times. The following <b>anticlines</b> can be distinguished (from north to south): ...|$|R

5|$|The Clearfield-McIntyre Syncline {{runs through}} the western {{lower part of the}} Kettle Creek {{watershed}} in a southwest-to-northeast direction. North of this syncline lies the Wellsboro <b>Anticline.</b> South of it lies the Hyner Dome. A set of fractures in the watershed causes the tributary Huling Branch to have a straight and narrow valley and for Kettle Creek itself to make a sharp 90-degree turn near the mouth of the tributary Twomile Run. Lateral bars that are nearly or completely devoid of vegetation can be found throughout the main stem of Kettle Creek. In the southern reaches of the watershed, where Pennsylvanian-epoch sandstones are located, the creek flows through steep valleys with narrow floodplains. In the central and northern reaches of the watershed, the main rocks are Mississippian and Devonian rocks. This part of the watershed is characterized by wider floodplains, less steep valleys, and some plateaus, enabling agricultural and residential development to a limited extent. Several miles upstream of the Alvin R. Bush Dam, the creek makes two 180-degree turns. This may eventually cause an oxbow lake to form.|$|E
5|$|No {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} Adams or its glaciers existed until Professor William Denison Lyman and Horace S. Lyman published descriptions of three of its glaciers and various other features of the southern flanks of the mountain in 1886. The White Salmon/Avalanche, Mazama, and Klickitat Glaciers were those described. They also postulated Adams {{to be the source}} of some of the Columbia River basalt flows. They thought that Adams was within what was originally an enormous caldera that was about one hundred miles across. The southern boundary of this enormous caldera was the <b>anticline</b> ridge that forms the southern border of the Glenwood Valley. Modern geology has since dismissed this theory. From information collected on an outing of the Mazamas in 1895, Professor Lyman expanded his descriptions of those three glaciers in 1896. Adams was finally properly surveyed in 1901, when Rusk led noted geologist/glaciologist Harry Fielding Reid to Adams' remote location. Reid conducted the first systematic study of the volcano and also named its most significant glaciers, Pinnacle, Adams, Lava, Lyman, and Rusk with suggestions from Rusk. He also named Castle Rock (The Castle), Little Mount Adams, and Red Butte. Reid noted that it was apparent that the glaciers of Adams had been significantly larger during the Little Ice Age. The geologic history of Adams would have to wait another 80 years before it was fully explored.|$|E

25|$|Fault bend folds {{are caused}} by {{displacement}} along a non-planar fault. In non-vertical faults, the hanging-wall deforms to accommodate the mismatch across the fault as displacement progresses. Fault bend folds occur in both extensional and thrust faulting. In extension, listric faults form rollover <b>anticlines</b> in their hanging walls. In thrusting, ramp <b>anticlines</b> are formed whenever a thrust fault cuts up section from one detachment level to another. Displacement over this higher-angle ramp generates the folding.|$|R
40|$|Deep seated flow of geoplasma (bathyrheal underflow), {{has been}} re-sponsible/or {{horizontal}} movements of crustal blocks of Lower Proterozoic {{in the northern}} part of the Northern Territory, Australia.
