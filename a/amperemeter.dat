Special rectifier topologies {{have been created}} {{in order to improve}} the rectifier behavior. In this paper another approach is discussed. This approach is based on the fact the rectifier is operated with only single amplitude for which it is frequency compensated. The logical circuits, which can be replaced with a microcontroller, set the preamplifier gain in that way the desired reference voltage was reached. Then, the displayed value does not refer to the measured value but to the preamplifier gain setting step. However, this value can be easily converted to match the measured value.

In this project created a tool that can measure the flow and display of the measured current signal into a PC-based Microcontroller ATmega 8535. This design uses Hall effect sensors UGN 3503 as current sensors, Hall effect sensor UGN 3503 can measure the magnetic field generated from the teraliri wire electric currents. Sensor output voltage is equal to the electric current flowing in the wire. The working principle of the flow measuring device based on PC (Personal Computer) is the current detection circuit that is the Hall effect sensor UGN 3503 used to measure the current flowing in a circuit then the current magnitude is converted into digital quantities by using 10 -bit ADC which is owned by the microcontroller ATMega 8535. Scale digital output from ADC is sent to a PC via the serial port and the PC data is converted into a form of signal. The existence of such forms results measurable current signal can then be easier in view of current changes occur in the series and can instantly save the data flow changes into the computer...|$|E

40|$|A {{standard}} method for picoammeter calibrations is the capacitor charging technique, which allows generating traceable currents in the sub-nA range. However, its accuracy {{is limited by}} the ac-dc differences of the capacitances involved. The Ultrastable Low-noise Current Amplifier (ULCA) is a novel high-precision <b>amperemeter</b> for direct current measurements in the pA range, developed at PTB. Its amplifier stages, based on resistor networks and op-amps, can be calibrated traceably with a cryogenic current comparator (CCC) system. We compare the results from both independent calibration routes for two different ULCA prototypes. We find agreement between both methods at an uncertainty level below 10 microA/A, limited by the uncertainty of the currents generated with the capacitor charging method. The investigations confirm the superior performance of the new ULCA picoammeter. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|In {{power supply}} networks, {{the quality of}} the voltage is {{becoming}} more and more of a determining factor. Non-linear loads such as diode or thyristor converters contribute to the degradation of the supply voltage quality. Non-sinusoidal currents of the non-linear loads result in the distortion of the supply voltage wave form at the point of common coupling due to the finite supply impedance. To improve the power quality of the supply voltage active filters and reactive current compensators are used. The optimal power rating and topology of these units are very important, but also the determination of the best compensation strategy for a specific application is very important as well. Different topologies and strategies can often perform related compensation functions, resulting in a situation where financial implications determine the best solution. In this situation the power quality analysis in network using simulation tools is very useful. power factor correction devices (passive filters) mains active restoring devices using semiconductors (active filters) measuring instruments: true rms voltmeter and <b>amperemeter,</b> digital frequency analyse...|$|E
40|$|In spin-based electronics, {{information}} is encoded by the spin state of electron bunches. Processing this information requires the controlled transport of spin angular momentum through a solid, preferably at frequencies reaching the so far unexplored terahertz (THz) regime. Here, we demonstrate, by experiment and theory, that the temporal shape of femtosecond spin-current bursts {{can be manipulated}} by using specifically designed magnetic heterostructures. A laser pulse is employed to drive spins from a ferromagnetic Fe thin film into a nonmagnetic cap layer that has either low (Ru) or high (Au) electron mobility. The resulting transient spin current is detected {{by means of an}} ultrafast, contactless <b>amperemeter</b> based on the inverse spin Hall effect that converts the spin flow into a THz electromagnetic pulse. We find that the Ru cap layer yields a considerably longer spin-current pulse because electrons are injected in Ru d states that have a much smaller mobility than Au sp states. Thus, spin current pulses and the resulting THz transients can be shaped by tailoring magnetic heterostructures, which opens the door for engineering high-speed spintronic devices as well as broadband THz emitters in particular covering the elusive range from 5 to 10 THz...|$|E
40|$|Mineral filler {{dispersion}} {{is important}} {{information for the}} production of mineral-charged polymers. In order to achieve timely control of product quality, a technique capable of providing real-time information on filler dispersion is highly desirable. In this work, ultrasound, temperature, and pressure sensors as well as an <b>amperemeter</b> of the extruder motor drive were used to monitor the extrusion of mineral-filled polymers under various experimental conditions in terms of filler type, filler concentration, feeding rate, screw rotation speed, and barrel temperature. Then, neural network relationships were established among the filler dispersion index and three categories of variables, namely, control variables of the extruder, extruder-dependent measured variables, and extruder-independent measured variables (based on ultrasonic measurement). Of the three categories of variables, the process control variables and extruder-independent ultrasonically measured variables performed best in inferring the dispersion index through a neural network model. While the neural network model based on control variables could help determine the optimal experimental conditions to achieve a dispersion index, the extruder-independent network model based on ultrasonic measurement is suitable for in-line measurement of the quality of dispersion. This study has demonstrated the feasibility of using ultrasound and neural networks for in-line monitoring of dispersion during extrusion processes of mineral-charged polymers.

3000|$|In this study, strains {{that are}} caused by wood-based panels on {{horizontal}} milling machines and other cutting devices were examined. In order to fulfill this aim, samples of wood-based panels such as particleboard, medium density fiberboard (MDF), blockboard, okoume (Aucoumea klaineana) plywood, poplar (Populus × euramericana) plywood, and oriented strand board (OSB) were examined. The strains that milling machines and planer head with reversible knives suffered were measured by an <b>amperemeter</b> using an experimental mechanism with six different wood-based panels, three different engine revolution speeds (rev/min), and three drive forward speeds (m/min). Using the experimental data and the data derived from wood-based panels, engine revolution speed, and drive forward speed, several regression equations were developed in order to anticipate probable strains {{for each of the}} wood-based panels. As a consequence, the utmost strains observed on machinery during planing were caused by okoume plywood, followed by MDF, OSB, particleboard, blockboard, and poplar plywood in decreasing order of intensity. It was also observed that the spent current values (A) increased during planing in which engine revolution speed and drive forward speed are always kept high. It was also clearly seen that the wood-based panels were more resistant to the machinery and the knives when they were operated at higher speeds. The results of experiments correlated well with the predicted values produced by the anticipation regression models (R [...]...|$|E
40|$|Galvanic skin reflex is a {{phenomenon}} where the electric current which was sent through the skin of palm or sole shows a temporary increase {{as a response to}} external or internal stimuli of the body. The receptor of this reflex is the skin and its electric polarizability is reduced temporarily by the stimuli. The apparent resistance of the skin is decreased and the current suffers a temporary augmentation. I observed in this report the influence of the initial level of the skin polarizability on the height of the reflex, by using another polarizing current for alteration of the polarizability. A polarizable electrode was applied on the human palm with the usual equipment of condenser circuit for the reflex, and the. reflex was brought about by deep respiration or stimulation with light. Under the above mentioned consideration {{of the nature of the}} reflex, it seemed more reasonable to measure the amount of change in the apparent resistance of the skin than to observe mere maximum deflection of the <b>amperemeter.</b> So I counted the change in the skin resistance (R) and showed it in the table. As the results I saw that by effect of anodal polarization, i. e. when I put the anode of another current on the palm, the reflex was augmented accompanying increase in the rest-resistance and rise of the level of polarizability, while by cathodal polarization the reflex was decreased accompanying reduction of the rest-resistance and fall of the level of polarizability...|$|E
40|$|This thesis for the Master of Science degree was {{performed}} at Solectron Corporation in Norrköping. The {{background for the}} thesis was a need to develop and build two test fixtures to automatize testing and adjusting of transmitter modules (TX-fixture) and receiver modules (RX-fixture) which are head devices in DWDM-systems. The basic elements for the test fixtures are: Test board, switch board and DC/DC board. The main function of the test board is to handle communication between the transmitter and receiver modules and supply voltage to these modules. The test board was insufficient and modified with a microprocessor to handle the communication between the PC and the receiver module. There are two connectors (NexLev) on test board to connect the receiver and transmitter modules. The switchboard {{has been used in}} fixtures for testing and adjusting both the receiver and transmitter modules for data rate up to 2. 5 Gbit/s. This board has been modified for use in new fixtures for data rate up to 10 Gbit/s. Because the power consumption of the test module will be measured with the <b>amperemeter</b> in the power supply, the reference module and the test module cannot be supplied by the same power supply. Because of high cost and the fact that no current is measured it is unacceptable to use a power supply to feed the reference module. The solution is to build a DC/DC board. Because the NexLev connector has a durability of 30 - 40 times it was necessary to have a connector with higher durability. This connector is located between the test board and the test module. Without this connector the project will not be profitable for the company. Some parts in RX- and TX-fixture have been used in older versions of fixtures for data rate up to 2. 5 Gbit/s. These parts have been updated for the new test demands of the new fixtures...|$|E
