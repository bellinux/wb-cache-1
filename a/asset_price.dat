5|$|Skyscrapers are a {{relatively}} recent phenomenon in Japan. Due to aesthetic and engineering concerns, Japan's Building Standard Law set an absolute height limit of 31metres until 1963, when the limit was abolished {{in favor of a}} Floor Area Ratio limit. Following these changes in building regulations, the Kasumigaseki Building was constructed and completed in 1968. Double the height of Japan's previous tallest buildingthe 17-story Hotel New Otani Tokyothe Kasumigaseki Building is regarded as Japan's first modern high-rise building, rising 36stories and 156metres (512ft) in height. A booming post-war Japanese economy and the hosting of the 1964 Summer Olympics helped lead to a building boom in Tokyo during the 1960s and 1970s. Construction continued through the 1980s and 1990s as the Japanese <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> bubble rose and fell. Mainland Tokyo is divided into two sections: Western Tokyo and the special wards of Tokyo. All of the prefecture's tallest buildings are within the 23special wards, which comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. Nishi-Shinjuku, a district within Shinjuku, was the prefecture's first major skyscraper development area. Starting with the construction of the Keio Plaza Hotel in the 1971, the district is now home to 11 of Tokyo's 40tallest skyscrapers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the implications of}} market microstructure for <b>asset</b> <b>pricing.</b> I argue that <b>asset</b> <b>pricing</b> ignores the central fact that <b>asset</b> <b>prices</b> evolve in markets. Markets provide liquidity and price discovery, and I argue that <b>asset</b> <b>pricing</b> models need to be recast in broader terms to incorporate the transactions costs of liquidity and the risks of price discovery. I argue that symmetric information-based <b>asset</b> <b>pricing</b> models do not work because they assume that the underlying problems of liquidity and price discovery have been solved. I develop an asymmetric information asset-pricing model that incorporates these effects. 2 This paper {{examines the}} implications of market microstructure for <b>asset</b> <b>pricing.</b> Both research areas focus on the behavior and evolution of <b>asset</b> <b>prices,</b> but the microstructure implications have been largely missing from the <b>asset</b> <b>pricing</b> literature.

After pressure from the finance ministry, the government compensated for these cuts by announcing an increase in the consumption tax from 3% to 7%, effective from 1997.

Hosokawa announced the increase but retracted the announcement the next day, leaving the tax at 3%. The government's response to the issue weakened its hold on power and was said to hasten its demise. The tax was eventually increased to 5% in 1997 by LDP Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.|$|E

25|$|Roh's ambitious initial {{promises}} to establish Korea {{as an international}} business hub in Asia faded soon after his election. Instead, Korea under Roh suffered negative publicity in the foreign business community due to prosecutorial investigations on the purchase and sale of Korea Exchange Bank by the Lone Star Fund, spurring foreign investors to join their domestic counterparts in leaving the country. When housing prices soared, To prevent speculative bubble like Japanese <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> bubble crisis, Roh introduced additional 1~3% of property tax on real estate exceeding 600 million won(about 600,000US$). This efficiently slowed down the bubble, but this policy met high opposition by the riches who had to pay higher tax. At the same time, Roh also increased welfare spending by 18% a year, and drastically increased spending by increasing {{the size of the}} civil service by more than 95,700 new hires, or approximately 60 people a day.

25|$|These models {{rely on the}} {{assumption}} that <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> fluctuations are the result of a well-behaved random or stochastic process. This is why mainstream models (such as the famous Black-Scholes model) use normal probabilistic distributions to describe price movements. For all practical purposes, extreme variations can be ignored. Mandelbrot thought this was an awful way to look at financial markets. For him, the distribution of price movements is not normal and has the property of kurtosis, where fat tails abound. This is a more faithful representation of financial markets: the movements of the Dow index for the past hundred years reveals a troubling frequency of violent movements. Still, conventional models used {{by the time of the}} 2008 financial crisis ruled out these extreme variations and considered they can only happen every 10,000 years. An obvious conclusion from Mandelbrot’s work is that greater regulation in financial markets is indispensable. Other contributions of his work for the study of stock market behaviour are the creation of new approaches to evaluate risk and avoid unanticipated financial collapses.|$|E

After Obuchi's death, Hashimoto led the faction until refusing to stand in the 2005 general election due to a fundraising scandal, and died shortly thereafter. The remnants of the faction, formally known by this time as Heisei Kenkyūkai (Heisei Research Council), remained active under the leadership of Yūji Tsushima, who resigned prior to the 2009 general election, passing control to Fukushiro Nukaga. The faction raised much less in donations during the 1990s and 2000s than it did under Tanaka and Takeshita in the 1980s, as electoral reforms enacted in 1994, coupled with new campaign finance regulations and the ongoing economic slump that followed the Japanese <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> bubble, weakened the power of factions in Japanese politics.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} Mitsubishi {{had seen}} {{because of its}} strong presence in south-east Asia reversed themselves {{as a result of}} the economic crisis in the region which began in 1991 with the advent of the collapse of the Japanese <b>asset</b> <b>price</b> bubble, referred to in Japan as the beginning of the Lost Decade and continued to 1997. The collapse was partly the result of the Plaza Accord agreement in 1985, which sought to equalize the United States dollar with the Japanese yen and the German mark. In September of that year the company closed its Thai factory in response to a crash in the country's currency and plummeting consumer demand. The large truck plant, which had produced 8,700 trucks in 1996, was shut down indefinitely. In addition, Mitsubishi had little support from sales in Japan, which slowed considerably throughout 1997 and were affected by that country's own economic uncertainty into 1998. Other Japanese automakers, such as Toyota and Honda, bolstered their own slipping domestic sales with success in the U.S. However, with a comparatively small percentage of the American market, the impact of the turmoil in the Asian economy had a greater effect on Mitsubishi, and the company's 1997 losses were the worst in its history. In addition, it lost both its rank as the third largest automaker in Japan to Mazda, and market share overseas. Its stock price fell precipitously, prompting the company to cancel its year-end dividend payment.|$|E
