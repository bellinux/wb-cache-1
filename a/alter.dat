5|$|Kazuma is {{a native}} <b>Alter</b> user who makes his living as a {{mercenary}} so {{that he and his}} close friend, Kanami Yuta, can live together. Kazuma's friend Kunihiko Kimishima gives him a mission to defeat another native <b>Alter</b> user. However, a man known as Ryuho from HOLY captures Kazuma in the aftermath. Ryuho tries to interrogate Kazuma over an unknown <b>Alter</b> user (later dubbed Crystal) who killed his mother and dog. Using a woman from HOLY named Mimori Kiryu as a hostage, Kazuma manages to return to his house. When native <b>Alter</b> users are captured by HOLY, Kazuma enters a forest where he finds Crystal. After fighting Crystal, Kazuma's <b>Alter</b> receives a power up. Shortly afterwards, it is revealed the Great Uprising was caused by a similar event in a parallel universe where all creatures are independent thinking Alters. Kazuma goes on a rampage against HOLY after Kinishima dies while helping him during one of his fights. Shortly afterwards, Kazuma and Ryuho fight, but during the battle, they open a gateway to the parallel universe, causing another uprising and attracting the attention of the Mainland government.|$|E

40|$|Whenever a rule is contractible, the law must {{establish}} separate {{rules governing}} how private parties can contract around the default legal treatment. To date, contract theorists have not developed satisfying theories {{for how to}} set “altering rules,” the rules that establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for displacing a default. This Article argues that when setting <b>altering</b> rules, efficiency-minded lawmakers should consider the costs of <b>altering,</b> the costs of various kinds of error, {{and the possibility that}} <b>altering</b> can impose negative externalities on others. There are two broad reasons for structuring <b>altering</b> rules that deviate from merely minimizing the transaction cost of <b>altering.</b> First, the Article develops conditions in which minimizing the costs of party error (especially nondrafter error) and third-party error (especially judicial error) will be paramount. It proposes a variety of <b>altering</b> interventions—including “train-and-test” <b>altering</b> rules, “clarity-requiring” <b>altering</b> rules, “password” <b>altering</b> rules, and “thought-requiring” <b>altering</b> rules—that might be deployed to reduce <b>altering</b> error. Second, when externality concerns or paternalistic concerns to protect the contractors themselves are insufficient to justify a full-blown mandatory rule, lawmakers might at times usefully impose “impeding” <b>altering</b> rules, which deter subsets of contractors from contracting for legally disfavored provisions. Impeding <b>altering</b> rules produce an intermediate category of “quasimandatory” or “sticky default” rules, which manage but do not eliminate externalities and paternalism concerns. These two deviations from transaction-cost minimization can often be usefully complemented by a third category of <b>altering</b> rules—what this Article calls “altering penalties”—which penalize one or both contractors who utilize disfavored <b>altering</b> methods. <b>Altering</b> penalties can channel contractors’ <b>altering</b> efforts toward means that better reduce error or better control externalities or paternalism. More explicitly theorizing <b>altering</b> rules as a distinct category of law can make visible legal issues that have largely gone unnoticed and lead toward the development of more defensible choices about how best to regulate opt-out...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{widespread}} {{deployment of}} Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) {{in law enforcement}} and border control applications has prompted some individuals with criminal background to evade identification by purposely <b>altering</b> their fingerprints.

Experiments were conducted on both real-world <b>altered</b> fingerprints and synthetically generated <b>altered</b> fingerprints. At a false alarm rate of 7 %, the proposed algorithm detected 92 % of the <b>altered</b> fingerprints, while a well-known fingerprint quality software, NFIQ, only detected 20 % of the <b>altered</b> fingerprints.
