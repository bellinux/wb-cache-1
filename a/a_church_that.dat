5|$|East Coker is {{the second}} poem of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets. It was started {{as a way for}} Eliot to get back into writing poetry and was {{modelled}} after Burnt Norton. It was finished during early 1940 and printed for the Easter edition of the 1940 New English Weekly. The title refers to a small community that was directly connected to Eliot's ancestry and was home to <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>that</b> was later to house Eliot's ashes.|$|E
5|$|From 1870 to {{sometime}} before 1978 {{the town had}} a nearby rail service but {{in the 21st century}} transport is by car or school bus. The town has a small largely Australian born, and aging, population. Whitemore has a few houses, <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>that</b> is part of the Uniting Church in Australia, the offices and workshops of Shaw Contracting, and a recreation ground and tennis courts used by the towns' tennis and cricket teams.|$|E
5|$|During 1890 {{work began}} on an eighth fort, known as Linkuva; new {{construction}} techniques were introduced, particularly reinforced concrete. The Linkuva fort {{became the most}} modern entrenchment, equipped with electricity, sewerage, and casemates for a garrison of 1,000 personnel. At the same time, massive groundworks were laid along with additional defensive structures, effecting the complete enclosure of the city center between the Rivers Nemunas and Neris. By 1890, seven forts had been completed, supporting roads had been constructed, and a railroad bridge over the Nemunas had been adapted for military transport. By now, expenditures on the fortress had amounted to over nine million rubles. The first bricks for <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>that</b> would serve the garrison were laid in 1891; it was completed in 1893. The following year construction began on a dedicated narrow gauge railway.|$|E
50|$|The {{first known}} church at Ølen was <b>a</b> stave <b>church</b> <b>that</b> was first {{mentioned}} in historical records in 1326. <b>That</b> <b>church</b> replaced during the 1700s with <b>a</b> timber-framed <b>church.</b> <b>That</b> <b>church</b> was eventually torn down and replaced in 1874. This third church at Ølen was consecrated on 20 November 1874 {{by the local}} Dean Kierulff from Stord Church.|$|R

5|$|Following Mary's childless death, her {{half-sister}} Elizabeth {{inherited the}} throne. One {{of the most}} important concerns during Elizabeth's early reign was religion. Elizabeth could not be Roman Catholic, as that church considered her illegitimate. At the same time, she had observed the turmoil brought about by Edward's introduction of radical Protestant reforms. Communion with the Roman Catholic Church was again severed by Elizabeth. She relied primarily on her chief advisors, Sir William Cecil, as her Secretary of State, and Sir Nicholas Bacon, as the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, for direction on the matter. Chiefly she supported her father's idea of reforming the church but made some minor adjustments. In this way, Elizabeth and her advisors aimed at <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>that</b> included most opinions.|$|E
5|$|From 1915 Gaudí devoted himself almost {{exclusively}} to his magnum opus, the Sagrada Família, a synthesis of his architectural evolution. After completion of the crypt and the apse, still in Gothic style, {{the rest of the}} church is conceived in an organic style, imitating natural shapes with their abundance of ruled surfaces. He intended the interior to resemble a forest, with inclined columns like branching trees, helicoidal in form, creating a simple but sturdy structure. Gaudí applied all of his previous experimental findings in this project, from works such as the Park Güell and the crypt of the Colònia Güell, creating <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>that</b> is at once structurally perfect, harmonious and aesthetically satisfying.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{took place}} {{a few months}} after the founding of the Anti-Slavery Society, and had a strong impact on Britain. Although public sentiment initially favoured the colonists, it changed with revelations. The abolitionist debate which had flagged, was galvanised by the deaths of Smith and the 250 slaves. The Martial law in Demerara was lifted on 19 January 1824. In Demerara and Berbice, there was considerable anger towards the missionaries that resulted in their oppression. Demerara's Court of Policy passed an ordinance giving financial assistance to <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>that</b> was selected by plantation owners in each district. The Le Resouvenir chapel was seized and taken over by the Anglican Church.|$|E

5|$|Flooding was {{considered}} worst in Puebla, {{and were the}} worst floods in about 400years, according to newspaper reports. A total of 21,342people evacuated their houses to 116shelters, mostly in the state's northern portion. The floods affected 16,511houses and 199schools. In Teziutlán, {{with a population of}} about 50,000, it is estimated the city received nearly half of its annual rainfall in about three days. Nine entire communities became isolated due to the floods, and the small village of Patla sustained heavy damage after the Necaxa River changed its course closer to the town. Widespread landslides occurred, including over 80 in Teziutlán alone; one mudslide there destroyed 80houses. Some of the landslides occurred along rivers and produced new lakes, but 85% of these broke within the first year. Population growth, primarily in Teziutlán and Zaragoza, occurred in landslide-prone areas along mountains. Along Sierra Norte de Puebla, deforestation contributed to additional landslides. A landslide covered the Zacatepec River near Zempoala, creating a natural dam and a small lake. Mudslides buried at least 16people at a school in Pantepec, and a deforested hill caused a landslide in the Indigenous village of Acalama, which covered up to 170people. Most had fled to <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>that</b> was also covered, and it is estimated that only 30people survived in the village. Statewide, 263people were killed, including 107 in Teziutlán who were buried by mudslides, becoming the worst disaster {{in the history of the}} town. In the village of Tetela de Ocampo, 31people died. In Puebla, 30,000people were injured, and 81 municipalities sustained damage, with statewide damage estimated at about $240million (2.1billion pesos).|$|E
5|$|It {{was against}} this {{background}} that Pope Gregory I decided to send a mission, often called the Gregorian mission, to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity in 595. The Kingdom of Kent was ruled by Æthelberht, who married a Christian princess named Bertha before 588, and perhaps earlier than 560. Bertha {{was the daughter of}} Charibert I, one of the Merovingian kings of the Franks. As one of the conditions of her marriage, she brought a bishop named Liudhard with her to Kent. Together in Canterbury, they restored <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>that</b> dated to Roman times—possibly the current St Martin's Church. Æthelberht was a pagan at this point but allowed his wife freedom of worship. One biographer of Bertha states that under his wife's influence, Æthelberht asked Pope Gregory to send missionaries. The historian Ian N. Wood feels that the initiative came from the Kentish court as well as the queen. Other historians, however, believe that Gregory initiated the mission, although the exact reasons remain unclear. Bede, an 8th-century monk who wrote a history of the English church, recorded a famous story in which Gregory saw fair-haired Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert their people. More practical matters, such as the acquisition of new provinces acknowledging the primacy of the papacy, and a desire to influence the emerging power of the Kentish kingdom under Æthelberht, were probably involved. The mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the Lombards who, as pagans and Arian Christians, were not on good relations with the Catholic church in Rome.|$|E

25|$|On {{his arrival}} in Sydney, Blacket possessed a small library of {{architectural}} books, and he kept abreast of the latest trends by subscribing to journals. Although {{there were a number}} of buildings with Gothic details in the colony at the time, in particular the existing south transept of the new cathedral, these structures had strongly Classical elements beneath their medieval detailing. Blacket was the first architect in Australia who truly understood the principles of the Gothic style and who could design <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>that</b> would satisfy the august societies of Oxford and Cambridge. Since it was the wish of so many colonials, not the least of whom was the Bishop, to assuage their homesickness by at least attending <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>that</b> reminded them of one in Cornwall, Yorkshire or East Anglia, Edmund Blacket was to become a very popular man.|$|E
25|$|Some {{minor changes}} {{were made to the}} parish {{boundary}} in 1954, including the transfer to St Magnus of an area between Fish Street Hill and Pudding Lane.

25|$|Some {{priests in}} some parishes (six out of 80) bless {{permanent}} faithful relationships.

Ingham says of the practice: I insist only that those on all sides of the issue respect one another and that everyone should maintain the order of the church. Our goal in the Anglican Church in the Greater Vancouver area is to be <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>that</b> accommodates differences.|$|E
25|$|Pobedonostsev did {{develop a}} social {{program for the}} Church while {{limiting}} its autonomy. He imposed repressive measures against the non-Orthodox. He carried out major Church reforms, but they resulted in <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>that</b> by 1900 was enmeshed in bureaucracy, alienated in many ways from society, resentful of secular authorities, and divided internally. Stagnation in church and state policies prevailed until Pobedonostsev retired in 1905. In the long run, argues Polunov, Pobedonostsev's attempts to impose safe conservative barriers to reform and his hostility toward innovation served only to weaken the autocratic state from within.|$|E
25|$|Next to Ashfield {{is the old}} {{graveyard}} {{containing the}} ruins of <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>that</b> was dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. This was a medieval church used for Protestant worship until 1795 when it {{was found to be}} too small for the congregation and a new one was erected a short way off. The end walls of the old church still stand, the west gable containing a bell turret and the east pierced by a chancel arch, the chancel itself having disappeared. The north wall is gone and all that remains of the south wall is an arched opening.|$|E

25|$|It is {{the third}} church built on the site. Seth Howes, a wealthy congregant, offered {{to pay for the}} {{construction}} of a stone church to replace the first structure, a wooden church. He hired architects Edward Pearce Casey and Arthur Durant Sneden to design <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>that</b> recalled the English country churches that were among the first to use the Gothic Revival architectural style. However, this structure burned down within months of being finished and was immediately replaced. The current building features stained glass by Calvert & Kimberly, former students of Louis Comfort Tiffany. The chancel window, dedicated to Howes, is thought to be the work of Tiffany. The main part of the church has not been altered since its completion, although an addition was built in 1961.|$|E
25|$|Other {{buildings}} are Loyola Hall (originally St. Mary of the Assumption Elementary School), Clavius Science Center, Saint Mary of the Assumption Chapel (named after <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>that</b> once was {{located on the}} current campus), Father Sullivan, S.J.

In addition, the $11.5 million Breen Center for the Performing Arts replaced the Xavier Center in August 2009. It houses all student performing arts programs and hosts many events for other local arts groups. A new $3.3 million cafeteria has replaced the former Student Center, stage, senior lounge, and cooking areas. It was renamed the Rade Dining Hall. Both the St. Mary of the Assumption Chapel and the Murphy Field House projects were funded and overseen by Murlan J. Murphy.|$|E
