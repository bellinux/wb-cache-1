40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} pre- and {{postoperative}} auditory and speech perception abilities and language development of prelingually deaf children below 2 {{years old with}} cochlear implants. METHODS: 5 prelingually deaf children (age range: 1. 3 to 2 years; mean age = 1. 6 years) were recruited. After 3 year of training, their pre- and postoperative hearing and speech perception and language ability results were compared. Results After implantation, <b>aided</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds, speech perception performance and language comprehension were improved. CONCLUSION: Cochlear implants were effective in the rehabilitation of young hearing-impaired children. Cochlear implantation should be provided to congenitally hearing-impaired children {{as early as possible}} to avoid the devastating effects of auditory deprivation. 目的: 通过对小于 2 岁的先天性语前聋幼儿在人工耳蜗植入术前及术后的听力和言语认知能力测试和语言能力的比较,探讨幼儿期植入人工耳蜗对先天性语前聋幼儿的影响。 方法: 受试对象为 5 例接受人工耳蜗植入的儿童患者,接受手术时年龄最小 1. 3 岁,最大 2 岁,平均年龄 1. 6 岁。经过 3 年康复学习后,对其听力、言语认知能力和语言能力进行测试,并与手术前测试结果加以比较。 结果: 系列测试结果显示,经人工耳蜗植入及 3 年听力和言语康复学习后,听力、言语认知能力及语言能力测试的成绩存在显著性差异。 结论 人工耳蜗植入对于极重度失聪儿童听力和言语认知能力的发展是非常有益的。先天性极重度失聪儿童应尽早接受人工耳蜗植入手术,通过术后的康复训练学习进一步发展听力和言语认知能力，避免因听力剥夺而带来的负面影响...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. This study {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} a recently developed, low-cost 'over-the-counter' style hearing aid with elderly people, who had mild to moderate mixed or sensorineural hearing losses. Two aspects were focused upon, objective change in the participants' <b>aided</b> <b>hearing</b> measures and the self-reported performance and benefit obtained from the hearing aid. Method. The hearing aids were trialed by 19 elderly persons over a 3 -month period. <b>Aided</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds and real-ear insertion gain measures were obtained from participants, three questionnaires (the Client-Oriented Scale of Improvement [COSI], the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids [IOI-HA] and the Profile of Hearing Aid Performance - Chinese version [PHAP-C]) were completed, and an open-ended interview was conducted. Results. Objective tests noted that the trial hearing aid was able to provide appropriate amplification for the elderly participants in this study. The device was rated by the majority of participants as providing benefit, with 16 of the participants (84 %) using their hearing aid from at least 1 to over 8 h each day and with all participants considering the low-cost instrument 'worth the trouble' of wearing. Participant ratings of benefit with the IOI-HA were comparable with those obtained in a normative study in which subjects used more expensive conventional hearing aids. Using the COSI questionnaire, participants typically concluded that their hearing improvement with the study device was 'slightly better' to 'better' than without amplification. The PHAP-C questionnaire results indicated that, while wearing their hearing aids, participants experienced difficulties only infrequently in most everyday listening situations. Comments made during open-ended interviews were equally positive and negative, with most negative comments focused on difficulties with either acoustic feedback or background noise annoyance while wearing the hearing instrument. Conclusion. Affordable, over-the-counter hearing devices provide a potential opportunity for greater numbers of persons with hearing loss to access amplification and benefit from improved communicative abilities. Further investigation and further development of these instruments is warranted, to provide enhanced rehabilitation outcomes for elderly persons with hearing impairment. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

One of the children had cochlear implants with a profound unaided hearing loss. One child wore hearing aids with a mild unaided hearing loss. One child had normal hearing. Participants' production of isolated vowels, words, and a sentence were acoustically analyzed using the Speech Filing System program to determine the acoustic distinction between each child's vowels. It was hypothesized that the child with normal hearing would have the largest acoustic vowel space due to her ability to utilize auditory feedback and sufficiently differentiate each vowel category.

40|$|Objective]The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the relationship between developmental delays and speech perception in pre-lingually deafened cochlear implant recipients. [Methods]This study was a retrospective review of patient charts conducted at a tertiary referral center. Thirty-five pre-lingually deafened children underwent multichannel cochlear implantation and habilitation at the Kyoto University Hospital Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. A pre-operative cognitive–adaptive developmental quotient was evaluated using the Kyoto scale of psychological development. Post-operative speech performance was evaluated with speech perception tests two years after cochlear implantation. We computed partial correlation coefficients (controlled for age at the time of implantation and the average pre-operative <b>aided</b> <b>hearing</b> level) between the cognitive–adaptive developmental quotient and speech performance. [Results]A developmental delay in the cognitive–adaptive area was weakly correlated with speech perception (partial correlation coefficients for consonant–vowel syllables and phrases were 0. 38 and 0. 36, respectively).

MethodsA 4 –year–old boy with diagnosed auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) received implantation of a Nucleus CI 24 R after an unsatisfactory trial of amplification. Post–implantation performance in both hearing sensitivity and speech recognition was assessed in different sessions. <b>Aided</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds were tested by behavioral audiometry. Mandarin Early Speech Perception Test (MESP), Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (MAIS), category of auditory performance (CAP) and Speech Intelligibility Rating (SIR) {{were used to assess}} the benefits in auditory skills or speech recognition the boy obtained from CI. The tests were administered before surgery and at 3 months and 7 months after opening. ResultsThe boy demonstrated improved auditory sensitivity by using CI. Concerning speech recognition and communication, both speech audiometry and questionnaires showed an obvious benefit from CI. ConclusionsCI has worked efficiently in this ANSD boy. But because of limited understanding of ANSD and rehabilitation effect by cochlear implantation in this condition, the clinical decision to implant should be cautious and only after a thorough evaluation.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe {{verified}} suitable {{hearing aid}} gain {{does not guarantee}} a benefit from the hearing aid. The aided pure-tone threshold and the speech tests constitute main validation tests, which can be an enigma when dealing with infants and young children. Accordingly, there is growing need for an applicable objective test that represents aided thresholds and cortical processing of amplified sounds. ObjectiveThis work was designed to incorporate the aided evoked cortical potential (AECP) testing in hearing aid benefit assessment battery of children. MethodologyThe study involved 10 young children {{with the history of}} regular hearing aid using for the correction of mild to moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss. Aided AECP consisting of P 1, N 1, P 2 and N 2 waves was measured for them using 500 and 4000 Hz tone bursts and ga- and wa-syllables. ResultsThe potential was traced in all subjects with different degrees of reproducibility of waves. It paralleled the speech recognition ability with reasonable correction values to the aided behavioral thresholds. ConclusionsThe tracing of aided evoked cortical potential constituted a valuable tool for assessment of hearing aid benefit. It can introduce valid information about the frequency specific <b>aided</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds and the speech perception ability. The total number of emerged waves in the potential revealed more selectivity to cortical function than the latency parameter...|$|E

This suggestion {{is based on the assumption}} that subjects can use tactile input in isolation, or in combination with information from residual <b>aided</b> <b>hearing,</b> to monitor and modify their speech. The present study evaluated the benefits to articulation provided through use of a multichannel electrotactile device (“Tickle Talker™”). Design: Six profoundly hearing-impaired children were videotaped speaking with the Tickle Talker on and with the Tickle Talker off during conversations with their audiologist. Five of the subjects also wore their binaural hearing aids during all recorded conversations.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{following}} {{study was to examine}} the relationship between working memory capacity (WMC), executive functions (EFs) and perceived effort (PE) after completing a work-related task in quiet and in noise in employees with <b>aided</b> <b>hearing</b> impairment (HI) and normal hearing. The study sample consisted of 20 hearing-impaired and 20 normally hearing participants. Measures of hearing ability, WMC and EFs were tested prior to performing a work-related task in quiet and in simulated traffic noise. PE of the work-related task was also measured. Analysis of variance was used to analyze within- and between-group differences in cognitive skills, performance on the work-related task and PE. The presence of noise yielded a significantly higher PE for both groups. However, no significant group differences were observed in WMC, EFs, PE and performance in the work-related task. Interestingly, significant negative correlations were only found between PE in the noise condition and the ability to update information for both groups. In summary, noise generates a significantly higher PE and brings explicit processing capacity into play, irrespective of hearing. This suggest that increased PE involves other factors such as type of task that is to be performed, performance in the cognitive skill required solving the task at hand and whether noise is present. We therefore suggest that special consideration in hearing care should be made to the individual′s prerequisites on these factors in the labor market...|$|E

40|$|HYPOTHESIS: The {{floating}} mass transducer (FMT) of the Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) can be interposed in {{the middle}} ear {{in case of an}} absent incus. BACKGROUND: The VSB is a middle ear implant in which the FMT is attached to the long process of the incus to directly drive the ossicular chain. In this case report, there was gradual deterioration in speech perception after VSB fitting and deterioration in hearing thresholds. During exploratory resurgery, {{it became clear that the}} ossicular chain was interrupted due to necrosis of the long process of the incus. The VSB could no longer function because there was no connection between the incus and stapes. METHODS: Reconnection of the FMT to the anterior crus of the stapes on 1 side and the tympanic membrane on the other side. RESULTS: Reconnection of the FMT to the stapes head led to obvious improvement in audiometric results. The air-bone gap was reduced from approximately 35 to approximately 25 dB, which indicated that the construction with the FMT was working like a partial ossicular replacement prosthesis. At 1. 5 years' follow-up, the <b>aided</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds of approximately 45 dB hearing level were slightly poorer than those measured after the first procedure with classical positioning of the FMT. However, the speech recognition score in quiet at 65 dB sound pressure level was 70 % with the classical FMT application and with the FMT connected between the stapes and tympanic membrane. CONCLUSION: It could be concluded that when the incus is absent, placement of the FMT directly on to the stapes is an acceptable solution...|$|E

Between 2009 and early 2011, 22 adult subjects with chronic otitis media (COM) underwent a SP, blind sac closure of the external auditory canal and abdominal fat obliteration to facilitate the application of an active middle ear implant (AMEI) in a staged procedure. Indications consisted of mixed hearing loss after previous tympanomastoplasty and failure of hearing rehabilitation with a hearing aid or bone conduction device in COM.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} audiologic outcome of bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) {{application}} {{in patients with}} congenital unilateral conductive hearing impairment. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective audiometric evaluation on 20 patients. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: The experimental group comprised 20 consecutive patients with congenital unilateral conductive hearing impairment, with a mean air-bone gap of 50 dB. METHODS: Aided and unaided hearing was assessed using sound localization and speech recognition-in-noise tests. RESULTS: <b>Aided</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds and aided speech perception thresholds were measured to verify {{the effect of the}} BAHA system on the hearing acuity. All patients fulfilled the criteria that the aided speech reception thresholds or the mean aided sound field thresholds were 25 dB or better in the aided situation. Most patients were still using the BAHA almost every day. Sound localization scores varied widely in the unaided and aided situations. Many patients showed unexpectedly good unaided performance. However, nonsignificant improvements of 3. 0 (500 Hz) and 6. 9 degrees (3, 000 Hz) were observed in favor of the BAHA. Speech recognition in noise with spatially separated speech and noise sources also improved after BAHA implantation, but not significantly. CONCLUSION: Some patients with congenital unilateral conductive hearing impairment had such good directional hearing and speech-in-noise scores in the unaided situation that no overall significant improvement occurred after BAHA fitting in our setup. Of the 18 patients with a complete data set, 6 did not show any significant improvement at all. However, compliance with BAHA use in this patient group was remarkably high. Observations of consistent use of the device are highly suggestive of patient benefit. Further research is recommended to get more insight into these findings...|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{release from}} masking (SRM) is {{believed}} to be an essential auditory mechanism aiding listeners in reverberant multi-talker environments. However, SRM is often measured in simplified spatial configurations using speech corpora with exaggerated talker and/or context confusions. Besides energetic better-ear listening and binaural unmasking, the perceived spatial separation of target and masking speech signals is thought to aid listener's segregation of speech signals, resulting in a so-called release from informational masking. This study aims to estimate the amount of informational masking that is apparent in complex real-world environments. Speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were measured by presenting Bamford-Kowal-Bench (BKB) sentences in a simulated cafeteria environment recreated by a spherical array of 41 loudspeakers placed in an anechoic chamber. Three maskers with varying degree of informational masking were realized: one with talkers different from the target, one with an unintelligible noise vocoder (minimal informational masking) and one with the same talker as the target (maximum informational masking). The maskers were constructed with either two or seven two-talker conversations and were either spatially distributed in the simulated cafeteria or colocated with the target. Seven normal hearing listeners were tested. All conditions showed improved thresholds for the spatialized condition compared to the colocated condition. However {{there was no significant difference}} between the different talker speech and vocoded masker. Only the same talker masker showed increased thresholds and this was only substantial in the two conversation colocated condition. These results suggest that informational masking is of low relevance in real-life listening and is exaggerated in listening tests by target/masker similarities and the colocated spatial configuration. However, this may be different in (<b>aided)</b> <b>hearing</b> impaired listeners where spectral and spatial cues can be significantly disturbed. 4 page(s...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Prelingually profoundly deaf children usually experience problems with language learning (Webster, 1986; Campbell, Burden & Wright, 1992). The acquisition of written language would be no problem for them if normal development of reading and writing was not dependent on spoken language (Pattison, 1986). However, such children cannot {{be viewed as a}} homogeneous group since some, the minority, do develop good linguistic skills. Group studies have identified several factors relating to language skills: hearing loss and level of loss, I. Q., intelligibility, lip-reading, use of phonology and memory capacity (Furth, 1966; Conrad, 1979; Trybus & Karchmer, 1977; Jensema, 1975; Baddeley, Papagno & Vallar, 1988; Baddeley & Wilson, 1988; Hanson, 1989; Lake, 1980; Daneman & Carpenter, 1980). These various factors appear to be interrelated, with phonological awareness being implicated in most. So to understand behaviour, measures of all these factors must be obtained. The present study aimed to achieve this whilst investigating the prediction that performance success may be due to better use of phonological information. Because linguistic success for the deaf child is exceptional, a case study approach was taken to avoid obscuring subtle differences in performance. Subjects were screened to meet 6 research criteria: profound prelingual deafness, no other known handicap, English the first language in the home, at least average non-verbal IQ, reading age 7 - 9 years and inter-subject dissimilarities between chronological reading age discrepancies. Case histories were obtained from school records and home interviews. Six subjects with diverse linguistic skills were selected, four of which undertook all tests. Phonological awareness and development was assessed across several variables: immediate memory span, intelligibility, spelling, rhyme judgement, speech discrimination and production. There was considerable inter-subject performance difference. One boy's speech production was singled out for a more detailed analysis. Useful <b>aided</b> <b>hearing</b> and consistent contrastive speech appear to be implicated in other English language skills. It was concluded that for phonological awareness to develop, the deaf child must receive useful inputs from as many media as possible (e. g., vision, audition, articulation, sign and orthography). When input is biassed toward the more reliable modalities of audition and articulation, there is a greater possibility of a robust and useful phonology being derived and thus better access to the English language...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review, using standard methodology,was {{to assess}} the clinical and cost-effectiveness of bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs) {{for people who are}} bilaterally deaf. Prospective studies comparing BAHAs versus conventional hearing aids [air conduction hearing aid (ACHA) or bone conduction hearing aid (BCHA) ], unaided hearing or ear surgery; and unilateral versus bilateral BAHAs were eligible. Twelve clinical effectiveness studies were included. No eligible comparisons with ear surgery were identified. Overall quality was rated as weak for all included studies. There appeared to be some audiological benefi ts of BAHAs compared with BCHAs and improvements in speech understanding in noise compared with ACHAs, however ACHAs may produce better audiological results for other outcomes; the limited evidence reduces certainty. Hearing is improved with BAHAs compared with unaided hearing. Improvements in QoL with BAHAs were identifi ed by a hearing-specifi c instrument but not generic QoL measures. Studies comparing unilateral with bilateral BAHAs suggested benefi ts of bilateral BAHAs in many, but not all, situations. A decision analytic model was developed to estimate {{the costs and benefits of}} unilateral BAHAs over a ten year time horizon. The incremental cost per user receiving BAHA, compared with BCHA, was £ 16, 344 for children and £ 13, 281 for adults. In an exploratory analysis the incremental cost per QALY gained was between £ 118, 898 and £ 55, 424 for children and between £ 98, 790 to £ 46, 051 for adults for BAHAs compared with BCHA, depending on the assumed QoL gain and proportion of each modelled cohort using their hearing aid for eight or more hours per day. Deterministic sensitivity analysis suggested results were highly sensitive to the assumed proportion of people using BCHA for eight or more hours per day. Exploratory cost effectiveness analysis suggests that BAHAs are unlikely to be a cost effective option where the benefi ts are similar for BAHAs and their comparators. The greater the benefit from <b>aided</b> <b>hearing</b> and the greater the difference in the proportion of people using the hearing aid for eight hours or more per day, the more likely BAHAs are to be a cost effective option. The inclusion of other dimensions of QoL may also increase the likelihood of BAHAs being a cost effective option. A national audit of BAHAs is needed to provide clarity on the many areas of uncertainty surrounding BAHAs...|$|E
