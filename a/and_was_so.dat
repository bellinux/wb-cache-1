5|$|Development of the Manchester Mark 1 {{began in}} August 1948, {{with the initial}} aim of {{providing}} the university with a more realistic computing facility. In October 1948 UK Government Chief Scientist Ben Lockspeiser was given {{a demonstration of the}} prototype, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> impressed that he immediately initiated a government contract with the local firm of Ferranti to make a commercial version of the machine, the Ferranti Mark 1.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn {{wrote the}} concert Hebrides Overture (Fingal's Cave) in 1830, {{inspired}} by visits to Scotland {{around the end}} of the 1820s. He visited Fingal's Cave, on the Hebridean isle of Staffa, as part of his Grand Tour of Europe, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> impressed that he scribbled the opening theme of the overture on the spot, including it in a letter he wrote home the same evening.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{formation}} of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, called the Armée d'Angleterre (Army of England) around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> confident of success that he had commemorative medals struck to celebrate the conquest of the English. Although they never invaded, Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation. Boredom among the troops occasionally set in, but Napoleon paid many visits and conducted lavish parades in order to boost morale.|$|E

5|$|Having secured patent {{protection}} for his designs and general adoption by the Brandywine millers, Evans now {{turned his attention}} outside Delaware. His brother Joseph travelled widely to promote Evans's work, and according to some sources, by 1792 over one hundred mills were operating Evans machinery. When George Washington called upon Joseph Tatnall in 1790 {{to thank him for}} the flour he provided to feed the Continental Army during the War of Independence, he saw Evans's technology at work in the mills in Brandywine Village <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> impressed that had his own gristmill at Mount Vernon converted to the Evans system in 1791, the completion of which was overseen by Evans's brothers. In 1793, Evans sold his share in the Red Clay Creek mill and moved his family from Wilmington to Philadelphia, where he opened a store for milling supplies.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, {{at a party}} held in Athens by court marshal Theodore Ypsilantis, Alexander became re-acquainted {{with one}} of his {{childhood}} friends, Aspasia Manos. She had just returned from education in France and Switzerland, and was reckoned as very beautiful by her acquaintances. She was the daughter of Constantine's Master of the Horse, Colonel Petros Manos, and his wife Maria Argyropoulos. The 21-year-old Alexander was smitten, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> determined to seduce her that he followed her to the island of Spetses where she holidayed that year. Initially, Aspasia was resistant to his charm; although considered very handsome by his contemporaries, Alexander had a reputation as a ladies' man from numerous past liaisons. Despite this, he finally won her over, and the couple were engaged in secret. However, for King Constantine I, Queen Sophia and much of European society of the time, it was inconceivable for a royal prince to marry someone of a different social rank.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Browne {{convinced}} Ziff-Davis to try {{a high-quality}} digest fantasy magazine. Fantastic, {{which appeared in the}} summer of that year, focused on fantasy rather than science fiction <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> successful that it persuaded Ziff-Davis to switch Amazing from pulp format to digest in early 1953 (while also switching to a bimonthly schedule). Circulation fell, however, and subsequent budget cuts limited the story quality in both Amazing and Fantastic. Fantastic began to print science fiction as well as fantasy. Circulation increased as a result, but Browne, who was not a science fiction aficionado, once again lost interest in the magazines.|$|E

5|$|In 836, Abu'l-Aghlab {{launched}} fresh attacks. A Muslim force {{seized the}} fortress known in Arabic as Qastaliasali (probably Castelluccio on the island's northern coast), but were driven {{away by a}} Byzantine counter-attack. The Muslim fleet, under al-Fadl ibn Yaqub, raided the Aeolian Islands and seized a number of forts on the northern coast of Sicily, most notably Tyndaris. In the meantime, another cavalry raid was dispatched against the region of Etna <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> successful that the price for Byzantine captives plummeted.|$|E
5|$|In actuality, Boyce {{stopped in}} London {{en route to}} a safari in British East Africa. It is true that an unknown Scout helped him and refused a tip. But this Scout only helped him cross a street; he did not take him to the Scout {{headquarters}} and Boyce never met Baden-Powell. Upon Boyce's request, the unknown Scout did give him the address of the Scout headquarters, where Boyce went and picked up a copy of Scouting For Boys and other printed material on Scouting. He read this while on safari <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> impressed that instead of making his return to America an around-the-world trip via San Francisco, he returned to the Scout headquarters in London. He volunteered to organize Scouting in America and was told that he could use their manual. While Boyce's original account does not mention fog, a 1928 account says there was fog. Climatologists report no fog on that day in London.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the third act, Bart argues that modern writers like Steven Bochco, one of the creators of the television series NYPD Blue, are more talented than Shakespeare. Bochco saw the episode with his children <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> flattered that he sent The Simpsons staff some NYPD Blue merchandise. After the ghost of Homer has spoken to Bart, he leaves Bart's room by flying through the wall, causing slime to appear on the wall. This is a reference to Slimer, a ghost from the Ghostbusters franchise who has a similar function.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Tarkovsky {{wanted his}} ex-wife, Irma Raush, as Hari. After meeting Swedish actress Bibi Andersson in June 1970, however, {{he decided that}} she was a better actress for the role. Wishing to work with Tarkovsky, Andersson {{accepted}} her salary in rubles. Nevertheless, Natalya Bondarchuk was ultimately cast as Hari. Tarkovsky had met her when they were students at the State Institute of Cinematography. It was she who had introduced the novel, Solaris to him. Tarkovsky auditioned her in 1970 but decided she was too young for the part. He instead recommended her to director Larisa Shepitko who cast her in You and I. Half-a-year later, Tarkovsky screened that film <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> pleasantly surprised by her performance that he decided to cast Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari after all.|$|E
5|$|On the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Hurricane Isabel {{produced}} a storm surge peaking at 8feet (2.4m) on the Chesapeake Bay in Hoopers Island and 6.5feet (2m) on the Atlantic coast in Ocean City. The {{track of the}} hurricane to the west funneled into the bay <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> strong it negated the normal tide cycle in the bay. Tolchester Beach recorded a record-breaking high tide of 7.91feet (2.4m) above mean low water. Rainfall in the Maryland portion of the Delmarva Peninsula reached 3.2inches (81mm) in Steeles Neck. The large circulation of the hurricane produced strong winds across the area, including maximum sustained winds of 52mph (84km/h) and a gust of 66mph (106km/h) in Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{was born}} in Cortland, New York, to John Brooks Parker, a farmer, and Harriet F. Stratton. Both of his parents were well educated and {{encouraged}} his reading from an early age. At the age of 12 or 13, Parker watched his father serve as a juror <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> fascinated by the proceedings that he resolved to become a lawyer. However, he trained initially {{as a teacher and}} taught in Binghamton. There he became engaged to Mary Louise Schoonmaker, the daughter of a man who owned property near his school. Parker married Schoonmaker in 1872 and became a clerk at Schoonmaker & Hardenburgh, a legal firm at which one of her relatives was the senior partner. He then enrolled at Albany Law School of Union University, New York. After graduating with an LL.B. degree in 1873, he practiced law in Kingston until 1878 as the senior partner of the firm Parker & Kenyon.|$|E

5|$|Riefenstahl {{attended}} dancing academies {{and became}} {{well known for}} her self-styled interpretive dancing skills, traveling across Europe with Max Reinhardt in a show funded by Jewish producer Harry Sokal. Riefenstahl often made almost 700 Reichmarks for each performance <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> dedicated to dancing that she gave filmmaking no thought. She began to suffer a series of foot injuries that led to knee surgery that threatened her dancing career. It was while going to a doctor's appointment that she first saw a poster for the 1924 film Der Berg des Schicksals ("The Mountain of Destiny"). She became inspired to go into movie making, and began visiting the cinema to see films and also attended film shows.|$|E
5|$|The Dark Side of the Moon was {{released}} {{first in the}} US on 1 March 1973, {{and then in the}} UK on 16 March. It became an instant chart success in Britain and throughout Western Europe; by the following month, it had gained a gold certification in the US. Throughout March 1973 the band played the album as part of their US tour, including a midnight performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on 17 March before an audience of 6,000. The album reached the Billboard Top LP's & Tape chart's number one spot on 28 April 1973, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> successful that the band returned two months later for another tour.|$|E
5|$|The large Mexican Cession of {{land had}} divided the United States politically, with {{many in the}} North insisting that slavery not be allowed there (and {{offering}} the Wilmot Proviso to ensure it), while others wanted slavery barred north of the Missouri Compromise line of 36°30′ N. Both proposals were anathema to many Southerners, and the controversy divided the Democrats. At the 1848 Democratic National Convention, the majority nominated former Michigan senator Lewis Cass for president, while a minority broke off to become the Free Soil Party, backing former president Van Buren. The Whigs chose General Zachary Taylor, a Louisianan, whose views on most political issues were unknown. Despite his past support for Van Buren, Pierce supported Cass, turning down the quiet offer of second place on the Free Soil ticket, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> effective that Taylor, who was elected president, was held in New Hampshire to his lowest percentage in any state.|$|E

5|$|The main shock hit Bucharest between {{noon and}} 1 p.m. The {{earthquake}} was felt for about 10minutes <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> violent that all chimneys {{in the city}} collapsed. Numerous historical monuments were destroyed, including St. Nicholas Church, Cotroceni Monastery and the 54-meter-high Colțea Tower. The Greek chronicler Dionysius Fotino reported that Prince Constantine Ypsilantis moved {{with his family to}} the Văcărești Monastery because his palace was severely damaged. However, despite the massive damage to buildings, only four deaths were reported: a Jewish woman and her baby, an itinerant merchant killed when Colțea Tower collapsed, and one other victim. The death toll may have been so low because the houses were built far apart and surrounded by large yards and gardens, so the buildings' vibrations did not propagate. Also, the building materials—mostly shingle and timber—were light.|$|E
5|$|One {{member of}} the Lord Nelson class was {{involved}} in {{what could have been}} a major accident on 23 January 1930. This entailed the leading driving wheels jumping off the track, though the locomotive ran for many yards before they re-railed themselves over a point. No. 860 Lord Hawke was derailed at , Hampshire on 14 August 1940 due to enemy action. a bomb fell on the track ahead of the train, which was unable to stop in time. No. 852 received a direct hit from an enemy bomb on 18 April 1941, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> severely damaged that it was not returned to service until June 1942. No. 854 suffered a firebox failure due to lack of water 23 April 1945, killing the fireman and injuring the driver. No. 851 Sir Walter Raleigh was involved in a serious derailment at Byfleet in December 1946, due to the poor condition of the permanent way. On 26 November 1947, No. 860 Lord Hawke was hauling a passenger train that was run into by another at , Hampshire due to a signalman's error. Two people were killed.

5|$|The railway {{was also}} {{upgraded}} at this time. Thomas Ward Ltd supplied replacement track in 1955, {{and a new}} 0-4-0 diesel electric shunter was ordered from Ruston and Hornsby Ltd in 1959. It was delivered from Lincoln on a low-loader in 1960, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> successful that a second engine of the same type was ordered the following year. The Hudswell Clarke steam engine was cut up on site in 1962, but the Corporation wrote to Peckett's {{to see if they}} would convert the Peckett engine to diesel hydraulic transmission. Peckett's declined, and so the engine was converted at the works, by cutting off the boiler and saddle tank, and fitting a Perkins diesel engine removed from a crane. It was completed on 12 May 1962, and worked well, although it spent most of its subsequent life working at Thrybergh tip. It returned to Blackburn Meadows in 1967, and was cut up later that year. A prototype steel side-tipping wagon was ordered from Robert Hudson Ltd of Leeds in 1955, and a further 22 followed in 1957, to replace the original wooden wagons. Charles Roberts and Co Ltd of Wakefield supplied 12 more in 1958, and a further 35 in 1961, with Hudsons supplying the final 6 in 1963.|$|E
