5|$|Some {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the clade Megaraptora, usually considered to be allosauroids, are basal tyrannosauroids. However, other authors disputed the placement of megaraptorans within Tyrannosauroidea, and a study of megaraptoran hand anatomy published in 2016 caused even the original scientists suggesting their tyrannosauroid relationships to <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> reject their prior conclusion.|$|E

5|$|Found in dry sclerophyll {{forest on}} sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soils, P.linearis {{is adapted to}} a fire-prone environment; the plants resprout epicormic buds from beneath their thick bark after bushfires. The fruit are {{consumed}} by vertebrates such as kangaroo, possums and currawongs. As {{with other members of}} the genus, P.linearis is rare in cultivation as it is very hard to propagate, either by seed or cuttings. It adapts readily to cultivation, preferring acidic soils with good drainage and <b>at</b> <b>least</b> a <b>partly</b> sunny aspect.|$|R
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> {{explaining}} why both Lamb and Hazlitt felt {{the inadequacy of}} Shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres themselves were huge and gaudy, audiences were noisy and unmannerly, and dramatic presentations {{in the early nineteenth}} century were sensationalistic, laden with artificial and showy props. In addition, unless one sat down in the pit, one could easily miss the subtleties of the actors' facial and vocal expressions.|$|E
5|$|Emma Goldman {{was born}} on June 27, 1869. Her father used {{violence}} to punish his children, beating them when they disobeyed him. He used a whip on Emma, the most rebellious of them. Her mother provided scarce comfort, rarely calling on Abraham to tone down his beatings. Goldman later speculated that her father's furious temper was <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> a result of sexual frustration.|$|E

30|$|One {{would have}} to be very careful not to {{attribute}} the decline to Tagmemics itself, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> only <b>partly,</b> because <b>at</b> the time the context was that of the dominant generative linguistics at the time. Their interest in language was so different from Pike’s that they didn’t engage with him, and they didn’t understand the importance of his contributions. But other folks did. If you look at the introduction or forward to Talmy Givón’s 1979 book, On Understanding Grammar, there he cites Pike as one of the key influential linguists together with Bolinger. But certainly, he emphasized the importance of Pike’s work.|$|R

Results indicate that shelter {{children are more}} sexually active, less knowledgeable about means of HIV transmission {{and are more likely}} to hold stereotyped representations of those most at risk of infection. Russian respondents were the most sexually active, a finding which could <b>at</b> <b>least</b> be <b>partly</b> explained by their higher levels of hedonistic values. These findings are discussed in the context of a climate of continuing social change in this region...|$|R

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the jet stream was <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> {{responsible for the}} widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States. Normally, the jet stream flows east over the Gulf of Mexico and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the Great Plains. During the Dust Bowl, the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains and {{other areas of the}} Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{the wood}} pigeon is {{commonly}} shot {{as a game}} bird, while rock pigeons were originally domesticated as a food species, and many breeds were developed for their meat-bearing qualities.

40|$|In Canyonlands National Park, {{south-east}} Utah, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 29 <b>partly</b> exhumed, aligned sandstone ridges trending generally N 20 -degrees-W {{occur at}} the upper unconformable surface of the Lower Permian (Leonardian) White Rim Sandstone. The ridges are <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 1. 5 km long, 250 m wide and have up to 14 m of vertical relief (mean of 9 m). A thin lag of coarse sandstone that contains wind-ripple laminae and granule ripples directly overlies the ridges. Angular blocks of sandstone within the lag and sand-filled fissures immediately below the lag, within the ridges, attest to early cementation of the ridge-forming material. SE-dipping aeolian cross-strata within the White Rim Sandstone and within the lag closely parallel the ridge trend. The ridges are interpreted as wind-sculpted desert landforms (yardangs) that developed on the lithified upper surface of the White Rim Sandstone during {{an extended period of}} hyperaridity {{towards the end of the}} Permian...|$|R
50|$|Battling {{these issues}} {{for much of}} the season, the Hornets {{finished}} the season with a record of 49 - 33, 7 games off the franchise best record of the previous season. This meant that the Hornets only finished 4th in the Southwest Division and 7th in the Western Conference. In the 2009 NBA Playoffs the Hornets lost 4-1 in the first round to the second seeded Denver Nuggets. All four losses were severe, the worst being a 58-point drubbing at home in game 4 which tied for the most lopsided loss in NBA Playoff history. Naturally lamented by fans and media alike, the embarrassing performance can <b>at</b> <b>least</b> be <b>partly</b> explained by the health situation of the players, with arguably the top 5 Hornets ailing to varying injuries.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} {{the frame of}} reference of auditory responses in the inferior colliculus in monkeys fixating visual stimuli at different locations. Eye position modulated the level of auditory responses in 33 % of the neurons we encountered, {{but it did not}} appear to shift their spatial tuning. The effect of eye position on auditory responses was substantial—comparable in magnitude to that of sound location. The eye position signal appeared to interact with the auditory responses in <b>at</b> <b>least</b> a <b>partly</b> multiplicative fashion. We conclude that the representation of sound location in primate IC is distributed and that the frame of reference is intermediate between head- and eye-centered coordinates. The information contained in these neurons appears to be sufficient for later neural stages to calculate the positions of sounds with respect to the eyes...|$|R

5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His {{frequent}} use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are peculiar to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> in Francia, {{but it is also}} possible that he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.|$|E
5|$|Astana was {{at first}} not invited to the Giro. Six days before the race began, RCS Sport (the {{organizers}} of the Giro) went back on the decision to exclude Astana and extended them a late invitation. This change of heart was <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> contingent on Contador, Leipheimer, and Klöden participating in the race. Having thought for two months prior {{that they would not}} compete in the Giro, most of Astana's riders had planned to take a break during the Tour of Italy, and Contador was actually vacationing on a beach when Bruyneel called him to tell him the team was headed to the Giro.|$|E
5000|$|L. lufengensis had a {{diet that}} {{consisted}} of both hard and soft fruits based on the paleoenvironment. L. lefungensis had similarly developed molar shearing crests to other miocine hominids such as Proconsul nyanzae, Ouranopithecus macedoniensis, Dendropithecus macinnesis and a Yuanmou hominoid, indicating a possible preference for harder fruits. However, the Yuanmou hominoid differs from teeth of the genus Lufengpithecus in several aspects of the evidence studied such as tooth size proportions, M2 shearing crest development, tooth enamel thickness and body weight [...]When compared to hominoid species of similar regions such as a Yuanmou hominid, L. lufengensis has smaller front teeth indicating <b>at</b> <b>least</b> a <b>partly</b> more folivorous diet compared to other extinct hominoids. This means along with consuming some hard fruits, they would also consume berries and leaves.|$|R

40|$|Much recent {{theoretical}} {{attention has}} been devoted to the provision of common goods across arenas. The normal problems of common good provision (Olson 1968; Hardin 1982) are exacerbated when these problems spill across arenas (there are usually no actors capable of imposing hierarchical solutions), but there are also new difficulties. Solutions in one particular arena of policy-making may be incompatible with the solution or broader regulatory mechanisms in another arena. Furthermore, states, which may solve some common goods problems seem to be losing some decision making competencies in the global arena. While non-state actors may provide <b>at</b> <b>least</b> some common goods (Ronit and Schneider 1999), it is unlikely that these forms of provision can be generalized in any meaningful way. Many authors believe that globalization makes it vastly more difficult to solve international common good problems (Cerny 1995). Yet this pessimism may <b>at</b> <b>least</b> be <b>partly</b> misplaced. The globalization literature argues both that common problems spill over state borders ever more (common good difficulties are internationalized) and that the capacity of state...|$|R
5|$|In October 2006, as details {{surrounding}} {{the crash of}} Flight 1907 began to emerge, the investigation seemed to be <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> focused on possible air traffic control errors. This led to increasing resentment by the controllers and exacerbated their already poor labor relations with their military superiors. The controllers complained about being overworked, underpaid, overstressed, and forced to work with outdated equipment. Many have poor English skills, limiting their {{ability to communicate with}} foreign pilots, which played a role in crash of Flight 1907. In addition, the military's complete control of the country's aviation was criticized for its lack of public accountability.|$|E
5|$|In the Introduction, Off {{explains}} the animal metaphors. Roméo Dallaire is the 'lion' because he acted courageously with {{an appearance of}} control and confidence. Lewis MacKenzie compared to a 'fox' because while he made a brave and dramatic defense of the airport, and was trusted by outside observers, his actions in recommending against intervention {{were based on the}} cunning logic that all sides were, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>partly</b> responsible for the conflict. Louise Arbour is portrayed as the 'eagle' for her pursuit of justice and her use of surprise SWAT-like arrests.|$|E
5|$|Indraloris {{is known}} from {{isolated}} teeth and fragmentary lower jaws. The jaw is deep under the last premolars, but becomes shallower towards the front. The lower premolars are elongate. The lower molars are shorter and broader {{than those of}} Sivaladapis. Indraloris may have been arboreal and <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>partly</b> frugivorous. When the first Indraloris fossils were discovered in the early 1930s, one was misidentified as a carnivoran and the other as a loris. The carnivoran identification was corrected in 1968, and in 1979 Indraloris and the related Sivaladapis were identified as late survivors of Adapiformes, an archaic primate group.|$|E
40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} not just one type of cancer. Differences in outcome and {{reaction}} to treatment can <b>at</b> <b>least</b> be <b>partly</b> explained by different histological and molecular subtypes. Recognition of these differences may influence treatment decisions. However, there is huge variation {{in the amount of}} information that is available. Several tumour types such as mucinous carcinoma, signet ring cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma have such a distinct phenotype that they are readily recognised. However, due to the rarity of signet ring cell carcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma, limited data are available. More recently defined subtypes, like medullary carcinoma, serrated adenocarcinoma and micropapillary carcinoma, are not adequately diagnosed, which limits research possibilities using large-scale data from registries. In the current review, we systematically describe the histologic subtypes with the clinical and molecular background. We evaluate their prognosis compared to adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified and speculate about the clinical relevance...|$|R
40|$|Vacuum {{assisted}} {{high pressure}} die casting processes appear to gain popularity in automotive industry. A number of thermal treatment schemes have been experimented {{in an effort to}} understand the effect of thermal treatment on tensile properties of vacuum die cast modified AA 365 alloy. The results of tensile testing indicate that, high temperature treatments have an observable effect on tensile properties. The average ultimate tensile strength of about 286 MPa is achieved at 200 ˚C thermal treatment for 90 minutes. However, the ductility has reduced to 7. 8 % from 10. 7 % in as-cast condition. The morphology of eutectic silicon and magnesium-based phase has sound effect on the tensile properties of the tested alloy. The reduction in the strengths of the alloy treated at 350 ˚C for 120 minutes should be <b>at</b> <b>least</b> attributed <b>partly</b> to the absence of the magnesium-based phase and change of eutectic Si morphology...|$|R

Regarding the capital, Carney said in February 2014 that price rises, which he said were constrained to the most affluent areas of the city, were beyond his control as governor, since they were driven by the cash purchases of the rich.|$|R
