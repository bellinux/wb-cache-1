40|$|Our {{ability to}} tailor the {{electronic}} properties of surfaces by nanomodification is paramount for various applications, including development of sensing, fuel cell, and solar technologies. Moreover, {{in order to}} improve the rational design of conducting surfaces, an improved understanding of structure/function relationships of nanomodifications and effect they have on the underlying electronic properties is required. Herein, we report on the tuning and optimization of the electrochemical properties of indium tin oxide (ITO) functionalized with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). This was achieved by controlling in situ grafting of <b>aryl</b> <b>amine</b> diazonium films on the nanoscale which were used to covalently tether SWCNTs. The structure/function relationship of these nanomodifications on the electronic properties of ITO was elucidated via time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and electrochemical and physical characterization techniques which has led to new mechanistic insights into the in situ grafting of diazonium. We discovered that the connecting bond is a nitro group which is covalently linked to a carbon on the <b>aryl</b> <b>amine.</b> The increased understanding of the surface chemistry gained through these studies enabled us to fabricate surfaces with optimized electron transfer kinetics.

The statistical difference of the partial charges was analysed {{based on the}} hypothesis that themutagens have amore negative charge on their exocyclic nitrogen atom resulting in stable nitrenium ions, and thus a longer lifetime to react selectively with DNA; whereas known drugs are not in general mutagenic and therefore have a relatively more positive partial charge. The nitrenium ions with 18 amine parent compounds did not show a statistical difference between drugs and mutagens based on the Mulliken charges. A slight difference was observed in the NBO data where the drugs have more negative partial charge on their exocyclic nitrogen atoms compared with the mutagens. Interestingly, nitrenium ions with aryl nitro drugs as their parent compounds have more negative charge on the exocyclic nitrogen comparedwith the other drug classes. Aryl nitro drugs are relatively scarce and are often linked to genotoxicity, which fits with the hypotheses proposed.

A single magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent that is detected through paramagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer (PARACEST) was designed to measure tumor pHe throughout the range of physiologic pH and with magnetic resonance saturation powers that are not harmful to a mouse model of cancer.

40|$|The general biosynthetic pathway for {{tryptophan}} is known. However, {{little information}} has been gathered on how substrates and enzymes interact when phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase (PRAI) and indole- 3 -glycerolphosphate synthase (IPGS) convert a substituted phenyl ring, PRA, into an indole moiety, IGP, via 1 -(O-carboxyphenylamino) - 1 -deoxyribulose- 5 -phosphate (CdRP). There has been no serious synthetic approach to develop methodology to produce a plethora of substrate and product analogues of CdRP. The studies described in this thesis cover methodology focusing on secondary <b>aryl</b> <b>amine</b> formation, using reductive amination, nucleophilic substitution and epoxide ring opening, leading to CdRP analogues. Reductive aminations with D-ribose failed to produce any aryl glycosylamine precursor, possibly due to the low nucleophilicity of aryl amines such as aniline. Removing the aromaticity and using cyclohexylamine produced secondary amines in moderate yield {{in the presence of}} benzylpentanal, and NaBH 3 CN, at a pH of 5. 5. This led to a successful reductive amination using anthranilate methyl ester. Secondary <b>aryl</b> <b>amine</b> synthesis via epoxide ring opening proved consistently reproducible. Using LiNTf 2 and high equivalents of cyclohexylamine or aniline in neat conditions opened protected epoxides. This has {{led to the formation of}} advanced secondary <b>aryl</b> <b>amine</b> synthons and the development of methodology leading to target compounds with functionality at the 1, 2 and 5 positions. Nucleophilic substitution using caesium base, high equivalents aniline at room temperature, gave a moderate yield of secondary aryl amines from sulfonyl and bromide good leaving groups. Raising the reaction temperature improved yields using low equivalents of aniline, with the optimal temperature being 50 °C. Ultimately using both the high equivalents of aniline or anthranilate methyl ester and warming the reaction in DMF gave the highest yields of secondary aryl amines. No overalkylated tertiary amine was isolated when a caesium base was used. Boc N-protection of 1 -phenylamino- 4 -pentene and asymmetric dihydroxylation gave the corresponding diol, which was phosphorylated giving the protected target 1, 4, 5 compound.

The equilibrating reaction conditions allow for the diastereoselective synthesis of the β-lactam 10 in which the phenyl ring is oriented on the convex face of the bicyclic ring system. Hydrolysis of the β-lactam with acidic methanol provides the hydrochloride salt of dl-threo methylphenidate in four chemical steps and in 48 % overall yield, a significant improvement over the previously reported pathway. This synthesis is the first stereoselective synthesis of this very important drug. * ^ The flexibility of our novel synthesis of methylphenidate allows for the facile manipulation of all three moieties (<b>aryl,</b> <b>amine,</b> and ester) of the molecule.
