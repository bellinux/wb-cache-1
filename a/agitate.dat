40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{association}} between care-recipients’ <b>agitated</b> behaviors, family caregivers’ burnout and abuse in community dwelling older Chinese with dementia in Hong Kong. Design: 6 -month prospective study Method: 149 caregivers provided information on their demographic characteristics, care recipients’ everyday functioning and <b>agitated</b> behaviors and caregivers’ burnout symptoms. Caregivers were re-interviewed 6 months later and provided information on changes in both care recipients everyday functioning and <b>agitated</b> behaviors, and verbally and physically abusive behaviors directed at care recipients in the past month. Results: The single most significant variable in predicting abuse at 6 -month follow-up was abuse at baseline. In additionApart from baseline abuse, verbal abuse was predicted by more co-residing days, {{a high level of}} <b>agitated</b> behavior, and a strong sense of caregiver depersonalization. Care recipients {{were more likely to be}} physically abused if they were male, had no chronic conditions other than dementia, and demonstrated a high level of <b>agitated</b> behaviors. Entering caregiver burnout into the model did not modify {{the association between}} care recipients <b>agitated</b> behavior and abuse for either verbal or physical abuse. Conclusion: This study is the first to establish an association between care-recipients’ <b>agitated</b> behaviors, burnout and abuse by family caregivers using prospective data. The present results confirmed that care recipients’ <b>agitated</b> behaviors and caregivers symptoms of burnout are associated with family caregivers’ abusive behaviors. Caregiver burnout did not mediate the association between <b>agitated</b> behaviors and abuse. Proper management of care recipients’ <b>agitated</b> behaviors and adequate support provided to family caregivers may help prevent development of new cases of elder mistreatment...|$|R

The neural substrate underlying the <b>agitated</b> behaviors in dementia is unclear. We hypothesized that different dimensions of <b>agitated</b> {{behaviors are}} mediated by distinct neural systems. Methods: All the patients (n= 32) underwent single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Using the <b>Agitated</b> Behavior in Dementia scale, we identified the relationships between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) patterns {{and the presence of}} each of three dimensions of <b>agitated</b> behavior (physically <b>agitated</b> behavior, verbally <b>agitated</b> behavior, and psychosis symptoms) in AD patients. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) software was used to explore these neural correlations. Results: Physically <b>agitated</b> behavior was significantly correlated with lower rCBF values in the right superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann 22) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann 47). Verbally <b>agitated</b> behavior was significantly associated with lower rCBF values in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann 46, 44) and the left insula (Brodmann 13). The psychosis symptoms were significantly correlated with lower rCBF values in the right angular gyrus (Brodmann 39) and the right occipital lobe (Brodmann 19).

An official, late-1964 total of 336,000 Tutsi settled {{primarily in the}} four neighbouring countries of Burundi, Uganda, Tanganyika (later Tanzania) and Congo-Léopoldville. The exiles, unlike the ethnic Rwandans who migrated during the pre-colonial and colonial eras, were seen as refugees by their host countries and began almost immediately to <b>agitate</b> {{for a return to}} Rwanda. Their aims differed; some sought reconciliation with Kayibanda and the new regime, some affiliated with the exiled King Kigeli and others wished to oust the new PARMEHUTU regime from power and establish a socialist republic.|$|E

5|$|The {{political}} tension between Norway and the Soviet Union became heated after Norway joined NATO in 1949. The Soviet Union issued memorandums to Norway stating that Svalbard {{could not be}} under a NATO joint command, but this was rejected by Norway, and the issue laid at rest. A new protest was issued in 1958 after Norsk Polar Navigasjon proposed building an private airport at Ny-Ålesund, which was then actively opposed by the Norwegian government in order to not <b>agitate</b> the Soviet Union.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to explore why some {{individuals}} with dementia and <b>agitated</b> behavior showed limited response to a personalized intervention. Ten consistently <b>agitated</b> individuals (i. e., non-responders) were compared with 34 individuals who were more settled during the intervention (i. e., responders). Most participants had severe cognitive deficits; however, non-responders were more impaired. Where responders showed large improvements across conditions, <b>agitated</b> behavior remained equally high in non-responders. Responders and non-responders showed increased interest and engagement during the intervention. Increased <b>agitated</b> behavior was associated with severe cognitive impairment. Although studies have shown that psychosocial interventions can reduce <b>agitated</b> behavior, {{there does seem to be}} a point where it becomes more difficult to reduce this behavior. However, non-responders still displayed interest, and the authors believe further personalization of the intervention is possible. Therefore, severe dementia and <b>agitated</b> behavior should not exclude individuals from psychosocial interventions; however, a more detailed and timely implementation plan of such treatments may be warranted...|$|R

He also became entangled in scandal when the State Treasurer, Benjamin D. Peck, lent out state funds to private citizens (including Dow) contravening state law. Peck lent large sums to himself, which were lost when his business ventures failed. Dow had guaranteed some of Peck's borrowing, and faced ruin as it became clear that Peck could not repay the state treasury. Dow was able to settle the debts and conceal much of his role in the affair, but enough of the scandal became known that some of his many enemies attacked him in local newspapers. Even some of his prohibitionist allies became less openly supportive of him. In September 1860, he did not run for re-election.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, various {{independent}} delegates {{gathered in}} Indianapolis to nominate a presidential ticket to campaign on those issues. For president, they chose Peter Cooper, an 85-year-old industrialist and philanthropist from New York, with Samuel Fenton Cary, a former congressman from Ohio, {{as his running}} mate. The Greenback ticket fared poorly in the election that November, attracting just 81,740 votes—less than 1% of the total. As bad economic times continued, however, the party gained momentum. Labor unrest the following year, culminating in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, added to many laborers' alienation from the two major parties. Local movements, like California's Workingmen's Party, began to <b>agitate</b> for laws to improve the condition of laborers (and {{for an end to}} Chinese immigration). By 1878, the third-party movement had become strong enough to elect 22 independents to the federal House of Representatives, most tied in some way to the Greenback movement. As the 1880 presidential election approached, members of the Greenback Party (or Greenback-Labor Party, as it was sometimes known) had reason to believe that they could improve on the results of 1876.|$|E

In Cape Town, Paarl and elsewhere Kruger lobbied vigorously against the annexation and won much sympathy. Davenport suggests that this contributed to the federation plan's withdrawal, which in turn weakened the British resolve to keep the Transvaal. Kruger and Joubert wrote to Gladstone asking him to restore the South African Republic's independence, but to their astonishment the Prime Minister replied in June 1880 that he feared withdrawing from the Transvaal might lead to chaos across South Africa. Kruger concluded that they had done all they could to try to regain independence peacefully, and over the following months the Transvaal burghers prepared for rebellion.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{diagnostic}} entity {{of major}} depressive episode includes both simple and <b>agitated</b> or mixed depression. Mixed depression {{is characterized by a}} full depressive episode with several symptoms of excitatory nature. Mixed depressions worsen if treated with antidepressants. METHOD: We have reviewed the clinical charts of the 2141 patients treated at the Centro Lucio Bini of Rome from January 1999 to June 2006. These patients were diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. Research diagnostic criteria were applied for <b>agitated</b> depression with motor agitation and Author's diagnostic criteria for <b>agitated</b> depression without motor agitation. RESULTS: One thousand and twenty-six patients had a depressive episode as index episode. Three hundred and forty six (33 %) were mixed depressive states. One hundred and thirty eight (44 %) of them were spontaneous; in 173 cases, the onset of the mixed depression was associated with antidepressants. CONCLUSION: Psychic and motor agitation are considered equally important for the definition of <b>agitated</b> depression. Treating <b>agitated</b> depression with antidepressants worsens the clinical picture. The use of Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), neuroleptics and anticonvulsants are recommended. The term Melancholia Agitata is proposed for <b>agitated</b> (mixed) depression...|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, the NSDAP was in {{a period}} of {{rebuilding}} and waiting. The economy had recovered, which meant fewer opportunities for the Nazis to <b>agitate</b> for change. The SA was reorganised, but with Franz Pfeffer von Salomon as its head rather than Göring, and the Schutzstaffel (SS) was founded in 1925, initially as a bodyguard for Hitler. Membership in the party increased from 27,000 in 1925 to 108,000 in 1928 and 178,000 in 1929. In the May 1928 elections the party only obtained twelve seats out of an available 491. Göring was elected as a representative from Bavaria. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 led to a disastrous downturn in the German economy, and in the next election, the NSDAP won 6,409,600 votes and 107 seats in the Reichstag. In May 1931, Hitler sent Göring on a mission to the Vatican, where he met the future Pope Pius XII.|$|E
5|$|Once Birmingham Dissenters {{started to}} <b>agitate</b> for {{the repeal of}} the Test and Corporation Acts, which {{restricted}} Dissenters' civil rights (preventing them, for instance, from attending the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or from holding public office), the semblance of unity among the town's elite disappeared. Unitarians such as Priestley were {{at the forefront of the}} repeal campaign, and orthodox Anglicans grew nervous and angry. After 1787, the emergence of Dissenting groups formed for the sole purpose of overturning these laws began to divide the community; however, the repeal efforts failed in 1787, 1789, and 1790. Priestley's support of the repeal and his heterodox religious views, which were widely published, inflamed the populace. In February 1790, a group of activists came together not only to oppose the interests of the Dissenters but also to counteract what they saw as the undesirable importation of French Revolutionary ideals. Dissenters by and large supported the French Revolution and its efforts to question the role monarchy should play in government.|$|E
