50|$|The {{ultracentrifuge}} is a centrifuge {{optimized for}} spinning a rotor {{at very high}} speeds, capable of generating acceleration as high as 1&thinsp;000&thinsp;000 g (approx. 9&thinsp;800 km/s²). There {{are two kinds of}} ultracentrifuges, the preparative and the <b>analytical</b> <b>ultracentrifuge.</b> Both classes of instruments find important uses in molecular biology, biochemistry, and polymer science.|$|E

The advantage of using analytical sedimentation equilibrium analysis for Molecular Weight of proteins and their interacting mixtures is the avoidance of need for derivation of a frictional coefficient, otherwise required for interpretation of dynamic sedimentation.|$|E

50|$|In 1954, Beckman Instruments {{acquired}} ultracentrifuge maker Spinco (Specialized Instruments Corp.), {{founded by}} Edward Greydon Pickels in 1946. This acquisition {{was the basis}} of Beckman's Spinco centrifuge division. The division went on to design and manufacture a range of preparative and <b>analytical</b> <b>ultracentrifuges.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1946, Pickels cofounded Spinco (Specialized Instruments Corp.) {{to market}} <b>analytical</b> and preparative <b>ultracentrifuges</b> {{based on his}} design. Pickels {{considered}} his design to be too complicated for commercial use and developed a more easily operated, “foolproof” version. But even with the enhanced design, sales of analytical centrifuges remained low, and Spinco almost went bankrupt. The company survived by concentrating on sales of preparative ultracentrifuge models, which were becoming popular as workhorses in biomedical laboratories. In 1949, Spinco introduced the Model L, the first preparative ultracentrifuge to reach a maximum speed of 40,000 rpm. In 1954, Beckman Instruments, now Beckman Coulter, purchased the company, forming {{the basis of its}} Spinco centrifuge division.|$|R
50|$|The {{kinds of}} {{information}} that can be obtained from an <b>analytical</b> <b>ultracentrifuge</b> include the gross shape of macromolecules, the conformational changes in macromolecules, and size distributions of macromolecular samples. For macromolecules, such as proteins, that exist in chemical equilibrium with different non-covalent complexes, the number and subunit stoichiometry of the complexes and equilibrium constant constants can be studied.|$|E
50|$|In an <b>analytical</b> <b>ultracentrifuge,</b> {{a sample}} being spun can be {{monitored}} {{in real time}} through an optical detection system, using ultraviolet light absorption and/or interference optical refractive index sensitive system. This allows the operator to observe {{the evolution of the}} sample concentration versus the axis of rotation profile {{as a result of the}} applied centrifugal field. With modern instrumentation, these observations are electronically digitized and stored for further mathematical analysis. Two kinds of experiments are commonly performed on these instruments: sedimentation velocity experiments and sedimentation equilibrium experiments.|$|E
40|$|Sedimentation in the <b>analytical</b> <b>ultracentrifuge</b> is {{a matrix}} free {{solution}} technique with no immobilisation, columns, or membranes required {{and can be}} used to study self-association and complex or “hetero”-interactions, stoichiometry, reversibility and interaction strength {{of a wide variety of}} macromolecular types and across a very large dynamic range (dissociation constants from 10 − 12 M to 10 − 1 M). We extend an earlier review specifically highlighting advances in sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium in the <b>analytical</b> <b>ultracentrifuge</b> applied to protein interactions and mucoadhesion and to review recent applications in protein self-association (tetanus toxoid, agrin), protein-like carbohydrate association (aminocelluloses), carbohydrate-protein interactions (polysaccharide-gliadin), nucleic-acid protein (G-duplexes), nucleic acid-carbohydrate (DNA-chitosan) and finally carbohydrate-carbohydrate (xanthan-chitosan and a ternary polysaccharide complex) interactions...|$|E

40|$|An <b>analytical</b> <b>ultracentrifuge</b> {{is capable}} of {{directly}} measur-ing the sedimentation coefficient, s, the diffusion coefficient, D, and the molecular mass, M, of macromolecules {{ranging in size from}} several thousand to tens of millions of daltons. When coupled with appropriate data analysis methodologies, {{it can be used to}} examine sample purity, detect and characterize conformational changes, determine subunit stoichiometries, characterize assembly and disassembly mechanisms of macromolecular complexes, and measure equilibrium constants and thermodynamic parameters for associating systems. As such, analytical ultracentrifugation is a powerful tool that should be included in the repertoire of any researcher interested in the structure-function relationships of biological macromolecules. Nonetheless, there has been a drastic decline in the use of analytical ultracentrifugation over the last 20 years [see Schachman (1992) for a historical review]. This can be traced almost solely to the fact that functional instrumentation has been unavailable during this period. However, the recent avail-ability of a new state-of-the-art <b>analytical</b> <b>ultracentrifuge,</b> the Beckman XL-A, has reversed this trend. Importantly, the capabilities of the XL-A in most cases have greatly exceeded those of the previous version of the <b>analytical</b> <b>ultracentrifuge,</b> the Beckman Model E. Consequently, analytical ultracen-trifugation has not simply been reborn, but has undergone a true metamorphosis. This perspective describes those aspects of this change that most profoundly impact the many + Supported by NIH Grants GM 45916 and RR 08352 (J. C. H.) an...|$|E

40|$|A multiwavelength UV/vis {{detector}} for the <b>analytical</b> <b>ultracentrifuge</b> (MWL-AUC) {{has been}} developed recently. In this work, β-carotene–gelatin composite particles are investigated with MWL-AUC. Band centrifugation with a Vinograd cell is used to ensure maximum sample separation. Spectral changes of the system are observed in dependence of the sedimentation coefficient and are attributed to a previously unknown inhomogeneity of the β-carotene chemical composition with both H- and J-aggregates coexisting in a mixture. In addition, our data suggest that pure H- and J-aggregates exist in a particle while their relative concentrations in a mixture determine the color characteristics of the sample. The unique abilities and properties of MWL-AUC include sedimentation coefficient distributions for all possible wavelengths, full UV/vis spectra of each different species in the mixture and 3 D movies of the sedimentation process.

40|$|The {{sedimentation}} {{coefficients of}} dsRNA segments of bovine rotavirus were determined in the <b>analytical</b> <b>ultracentrifuge.</b> The eleven segments {{were separated by}} preparative gel electrophoresis, and isolated by elution from gel pieces. The RNA was labelled by the intercalating fluorescent dye ethidium bromide at a ratio bound dye per base pair between 0. 003 to 0. 018.

All dsRNA segments of rotavirus (663 - 3409 base pairs) and the dsRNA 5 of cucumber mosaic virus (335 base pairs) fit the model of a "worm-like" or flexible cylinder with a persistence length of 1125 A and a hydrated diameter of 30 A.

40|$|Solution {{studies of}} the cytoplasmic domain (molecular mass {{approximately}} 40 kDa) of band 3, the anion exchanger from human erythrocyte membranes, previously suggested a dimeric molecule {{on the basis of}} the relative techniques of calibrated gel filtration and calibrated preparative ultracentrifugation. This dimeric behavior is firmly established on an absolute basis by a combination of calibrated gel chromatography and absolute ultracentrifugation techniques. Sedimentation velocity in the <b>analytical</b> <b>ultracentrifuge</b> combined with calibrated gel chromatography give a molecular mass M of (77 +/- 4) kDa, a value confirmed by low-speed sedimentation equilibrium. Velocity sedimentation in the <b>analytical</b> <b>ultracentrifuge</b> gave a single sedimenting species with an s o 20,w of (3. 74 +/- 0. 07) S. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis was also used to establish the strength of the binding via the dissociation constant Kd, with a value from direct fitting of the concentration distribution curves of (2. 8 +/- 0. 5) microM, confirmed by a value of approximately 3 microM obtained from fitting a plot of molecular weight Mw,app versus cell loading concentration.
