Former Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson asserted that his old club were favourites because they had the [...] "best players … If they all remain fit week-in week-out then they will not be beaten." [...] Glenn Moore of The Independent wrote of Arsenal's chances: [...] "They will be thereabouts, but unless Wenger finally puts his faith in youth, and the likes of Jérémie Aliadière, Jermaine Pennant and Phillipe Senderos repay him, they may lack the depth to sustain a title campaign." [...] Defender Sol Campbell however believed the squad was [...] "strong enough for the league and FA Cup", but doubted their chances of winning the UEFA Champions League.|$|E

In October 2016, Derrickson confirmed he had plans for a sequel, saying, [...] "I love the character, I love the visual possibilities, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> comics so well— the tip of an iceberg. There's so much progress that can be made." [...] He would like to follow the example of The Dark Knight and [...] "bring in a villain where you really got to go deep [...] a more visceral experience". Cumberbatch added that he had signed on for at least one more Doctor Strange solo film. Derrickson hoped to feature Nightmare in a potential sequel, and expressed interest in further exploring the characters Jonathan Pangborn and Hamir in a sequel, after their smaller roles in the first film. He also explained that he is [...] "kept in the loop" [...] on how the Avengers films will use Strange, because of his close relationships with Feige and co-director Joe Russo. Spaihts has also expressed interest in seeing Clea appear in a potential sequel. By April 2017, it was reported that Derrickson would return for a potential sequel, beginning work on it after fulfilling his commitments to the television series, Locke & Key.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a heated}} Senate floor speech in July 2015, Cruz accused Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of telling [...] "a {{flat-out}} lie" [...] over his intentions to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which Cruz opposes. [...] "What {{we just saw}} today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press {{over and over and}} over again was a simple lie", Cruz said of Senate Republican Leader McConnell. Cruz's [...] "incendiary outburst" [...] was [...] "unusual in the cordial atmosphere of the Senate", according to Reuters. In the same speech, Cruz assailed the [...] "Republican majority in both houses of Congresses" [...] for what Cruz termed an insufficiently conservative record. Cruz's speech, and especially his accusation against McConnell, was condemned by various senior Republican senators, with John McCain saying that the speech was [...] "outside the realm of Senate behavior" [...] and [...] "a very wrong thing to do". Orrin Hatch expressed a similar opinion: [...] "I don't condone the use of that kind of language against another senator unless they can show definitive proof that there was a lie ... <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> leader didn't lie." [...] Cruz had alleged that McConnell scheduled a vote on the Ex-Im Bank as part of a deal to persuade Democrats like Maria Cantwell to stop blocking a trade bill, whereas McConnell denied there was any [...] "deal", and that denial is what Cruz termed a [...] "lie"; Hatch says McConnell did pledge to help Cantwell get a vote on the Ex-Im Bank.|$|E
2500|$|After her {{elimination}} from American Idol, Miller {{announced plans}} to launch a music career as soon as possible, {{as well as an}} eventual acting career. Of her intents for her debut studio album, Miller has revealed that she would like to write or co-write all material and intends to show all sides to her personality in an intricate and artistic manner which she feels current mainstream music largely lacks. She further explained, [...] "I want to have music that has meaning and is real. I don't want to have dance-party music, but at the same time, I don't want to put people to sleep. I want to incorporate the soulful piano sound with a lot of edge. I know the message that I want to send out, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> music I want to do. I can't wait to show it to people." [...] The top three finalists – Miller, Candice Glover and Harrison – recorded background vocals on a song for judge Mariah Carey's fourteenth studio album, though it is yet to be confirmed whether it will be on the final track listing. On May 17, 2013, subsequent to the series' finale, Miller released her debut single [...] "You Set Me Free" [...] to digital retailers via her American Idol contract with 19 Recordings. On May 22, 2013, reports surfaced that Miller had signed a publishing contract with Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG), and is in midst of searching for a record deal. In June 2013, Miller confirmed she was co-writing with Toby Gad, Autumn Rowe, David Hodges, Adam Watts and his Red Decibel team and recording demos in Los Angeles, California through social media. Along with the remainder of the Top 11 from season twelve, Miller embarked on the American Idols LIVE! Tour 2013, where she showcased original music, from July to August 2013.

2500|$|Michael Hogan of The Telegraph {{noted that}} [...] "Capaldi {{is back to}} his charismatic best" [...] in [...] "The Pilot", stating [...] "devoted Whovian is keen {{to go out with}} a bang", and {{described}} his character as [...] "mercurial, magical and kind". Patrick Mulkern praised Sarah Dollard's writing of the Doctor in [...] "Thin Ice", noting how she [...] "examines his moral code; the ideals he aspires to and the crimes and misdemeanors he's prepared to indulge". Capaldi's performance in [...] "Extremis" [...] received praise, with Alasdair Wilkins stating [...] "Peter Capaldi is perilously close to becoming my unqualified pick for favorite Doctor, he underplays the moment, making small choices to signal both his compassion and his heartbreak". He also praised the interactions between him and Missy, noting how they recall [...] "a more emotionally complex version of the repartee that Jon Pertwee’s Doctor and Roger Delgado’s Master had during their many encounters". Patrick Mulkern praised Capaldi’s performance in [...] "The Lie of the Land" [...] proclaiming [...] "he wavers between downright nasty and at best disconcerting. He’s world-weary — specifically, Earth-weary. You can almost believe he’s working for the dark side, so great is his disenchantment with the human race". After the broadcast of World Enough and Time, Steven Moffat paid a special tribute to Capaldi, “Peter only has to think at the screen and you know what he’s thinking,” he said. “He only has to move his face <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> particular blend of Scottish torment he’s feeling right now. Despite trying to fight his emotions, he has given us the most emotional Doctor.” [...] Capaldi received overwhelming praise for his performance in [...] "The Doctor Falls" [...] with Patrick Mulkern noted the episode as a story dedicated to the character and how he [...] "stands tall", along with Daniel Jackson of the Daily Mirror highlighting the twelfth Doctor, praising how he [...] "simply shines". Flickering Myth stated [...] "Peter Capaldi is a magnificent Doctor, a person who captures the wisdom, madness, caring and frustration of a two-thousand year old Time Lord". Digital Spy praised Capaldi's [...] "Where I stand is where I fall" [...] speech, noting it as quite possibly the actor's finest moment to date. Simon Brew of Den of Geek heavily praised the actor's performance stating: [...] "The majestic, wonderful, brilliant Peter Capaldi. If you needed a reminder of just how much he’s going to be missed when he finally departs Doctor Who {{at the end of the}} year, his outstanding work here was precisely that. When he was blasted, apparently mortally, and he kept holding off his regeneration I found myself saying out loud “I don’t want you to go”". Ross Ruediger of New York Magazine agreed, admitting that [...] "the man’s been a revelation. I love Peter Capaldi. He has without a doubt been my Doctor for this new incarnation of Doctor Who that’s wrapping up its tenth season, and we have been nothing short of fortunate to have been blessed with his talents. I don’t want you to go either, Peter".|$|E
