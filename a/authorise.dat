5|$|Changing {{technologies}} {{have affected the}} recording, distribution, and varying profitability of the underground industry.

5|$|Financial {{irregularities}} at the WHH led in 1862 to {{the company}} suffering severe financial difficulties, resulting in the resignation of Ward Jackson from the boards of the WHH and the Cleveland Railway.

50|$|<b>Authorised</b> Officers are {{required}} {{to adhere to the}} Code of Conduct for Public Transport <b>Authorised</b> Officers. and violations of this code are prosecuted.

The <b>Authorised</b> Officer also have the right to request proof of the given information.

50|$|The {{estimate}} of cost was evidently inadequate, because a second Act <b>authorised</b> borrowing of £48,100, a third Act of 1821 <b>authorised</b> {{an increase in}} share capital of a further £50,000 and a fourth <b>authorised</b> a further £60,000.|$|R
50|$|The Stirling and Dunfermline Railway was <b>authorised</b> on 16 July 1846.

5|$|In 1720 {{the first}} Act of Parliament to <b>authorise</b> {{improvements}} to the river was obtained by three gentlemen of Cheshire. The act was dated 23 March 1720 and authorised work between Frodsham bridge and Winsford bridge. Rates for tolls were set, which were to be reduced by 20 per cent once the cost of construction had been met, and profits were then {{to be used to}} maintain bridges and highways within Cheshire. Each year the Justices of the Peace were to meet to decide which structures should benefit from this source of revenue. The Act included powers to improve the Witton Brook from the Weaver to Witton Bridge. Following a plea by the owner of brine workings near Middlewich, who felt they would be disadvantaged by the new navigation, a separate Act was obtained on 7 June 1721 to <b>authorise</b> {{improvements to the}} River Dane, but did not result in any work being undertaken.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to Clement's visit, moreover, the Pope had empowered the Bishops of Dunkeld, Brechin and St Andrews {{to take action}} to rescue the bishopric. He told these bishops that, Since the continual care of all the churches is our daily burden, we grant to the said Church , so far as we personally can, and <b>authorise</b> you, if you find the situation to be as described, to assign to the said Bishop, if it can be done without scandal, a quarter of the teinds of all the parish churches of the Diocese of Dunblane, so that under your guidance and that of upright men, he may set aside a suitable portion of them for his own maintenance, and thereafter assign revenues for a dean and canons whom we wish and <b>authorise</b> you to institute there. Failing this, the Pope wrote, The quarter teinds of all the churches of the Diocese assigned to the Bishop, which are held by laymen, you shall transfer with the episcopal seat to the Canons Regular of St. John in the Diocese , who shall have power to elect a Bishop in any vacancy.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 1847 the North Staffordshire Railway Act was passed. The act was {{necessary}} {{was because of}} problems encountered {{with the construction of}} the Crewe branch. The opportunity was taken to <b>authorise</b> several other deviations and small branches. It also consolidated the previous acts and importantly, forced the NSR to ensure that all lines were completed by specifying that ordinary dividends were not to exceed 5% until the Churnet Valley and Willington lines had been opened.|$|E
5|$|The 1846 {{session of}} Parliament {{experienced}} a snowstorm of bills for new railways; {{many of these}} threatened to encroach on the GPK area of influence and abstract business; several schemes were promoted by the Caledonian Railway or its allies; in self-defence the GPK itself promoted numerous schemes—in fact 25 branches {{as well as a}} bill nominally by the K to <b>authorise</b> the modernisation works—to head off some of the encroachment.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the River Slea was not navigable beyond Kyme, as {{the channel}} was inadequate, {{and there were}} fish weirs and water mills on its course. Three {{attempts}} were made to obtain an Act of Parliament to <b>authorise</b> improvements, but all were defeated. In 1791, William Jessop and John Hudson were commissioned to prepare a new survey and plans. Jessop was a canal engineer of some repute, with experience of several navigations, including the River Trent at Newark, while Hudson was less well known, but had experience of canal building in eastern England and Yorkshire. Their report was published on 25 November 1791, and estimated that the improvements would cost £9,979.|$|E
5|$|Government {{meetings}} are public; however, {{the government may}} decide to close any part of its sessions (or entire sessions) to the public. The prime minister may <b>authorise</b> any deputy to represent the PM and otherwise take over any particular task assigned to the PM. The quorum for government sessions is a majority of government members. Most decisions are reached by a simple majority vote; a two-thirds majority vote is required for decisions about changes to the Croatian Constitution, uniting with other states or transferring any part of Croatian sovereignty to supranational organisations, changes to Croatian borders, dissolution of the parliament, or calling a referendum.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the victory at Tobruk, Rommel persuaded Hitler to <b>authorise</b> an attack on Egypt instead of Malta, over Kesselring's objections. The {{parachute}} troops assembled for Operation Herkules were sent to Rommel. Things went well at first, with Rommel winning the Battle of Mersa Matruh, but just as Kesselring had warned, the logistical difficulties mounted and the result was the disastrous First Battle of El Alamein, Battle of Alam el Halfa and Second Battle of El Alamein. Kesselring considered Rommel to be a great general leading fast-moving troops at the corps level of command, but felt that he was too moody and changeable for higher command. For Kesselring, Rommel's nervous breakdown and hospitalisation for depression {{at the end of the}} African Campaign only confirmed this.|$|E

5|$|The {{acceleration}} of the German naval building programme in 1907–1908 forced H. H. Asquith's Liberal Government to yield to public pressure and <b>authorise</b> more ships for the 1909–1910 Construction Programme. Only a single battleship and a battlecruiser had been authorised in 1908–1909, but three battleships and a battlecruiser were authorised in 1909–1910 with another three battleships and a battlecruiser planned as contingency ships to placate {{the public and the}} Admiralty. Continuing pressure forced the Government to announce in July 1909 that the contingency ships would also be built. This pressure also allowed the Admiralty to gain approval to improve the size and power of its new ships so as to maintain qualitative superiority over the new German dreadnoughts then under construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{complaints}} from the SS-FHA {{about the quality}} of Volksdeutsche recruits had no effect on Berger's approach. He concluded further agreements with Hungary and Romania, and imposed on the puppet regimes of the Independent State of Croatia and the Slovak State, to effectively <b>authorise</b> the unrestricted conscription of ethnic Germans in those territories. In the German-occupied territory of Serbia, the General Government (annexed Poland) and parts of the Soviet Union, ethnic Germans were conscripted into the Waffen-SS in the same arbitrary manner Reich Germans were conscripted by the Wehrmacht. By the end of 1943, a quarter of the strength of the Waffen-SS was made up of Volksdeutsche.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{intention was}} for the Bridgewater Canal to reach Salford from the Duke of Bridgewater's coal mines in Worsley, by remaining on the north bank of the Irwell. Work began in 1759, but it was quickly decided to alter the route by building a masonry aqueduct to carry the waterway over the Irwell at Barton, and terminate instead in Manchester, {{to the south of}} the river. A Bill to <b>authorise</b> the new route was presented to parliament on 13 November 1759, and in January the following year Brindley travelled to London to give evidence before a parliamentary committee in support of the proposal.|$|E
