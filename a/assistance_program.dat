5|$|Over {{the years}} {{there has been}} a gradual decline in {{participation}} in the nutrition <b>assistance</b> <b>program.</b> Participation in the previous Food Stamp program was estimated at 56%, more than 1.5 million island residents, before the creation of the block grant.

40|$|The {{social safety}} nets in Mexico and the United States {{rely heavily on}} food <b>assistance</b> <b>programs</b> to ensure food {{security}} and access to safe and nutritious foods. To achieve these general goals, both countries' programs are exclusively paid for out of internal funds and both target low-income households and/or individuals. Despite those similarities, economic, cultural, and demographic differences between the countries lead to differences in their abilities to ensure food security and access to safe and nutritious foods. Mexico uses geographic and household targeting to distribute benefits while the United States uses only household targeting. U. S. food <b>assistance</b> <b>programs</b> tend to be countercyclical (as the economy expands, food assistance expenditures decline and vice-versa). Mexican food <b>assistance</b> <b>programs</b> appear to be neither counter- nor procyclical.
