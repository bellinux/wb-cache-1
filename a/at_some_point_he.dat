5|$|John Doukas is {{no longer}} {{mentioned}} in the Alexiad after his 1097 campaign. It is, however, known from monastic documents that <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>he</b> retired to a monastery and assumed the monastic name Antony.

5|$|In August, Breckinridge {{traveled}} to Virginia's Sweet Springs {{to improve his}} health. He visited family and friends while there, but the exact dates and locations he visited are not known. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> <b>he</b> obtained a draft of resolutions written by Vice President Thomas Jefferson denouncing the recently-enacted Alien and Sedition Acts. Jefferson wished to keep his authorship secret, and Breckinridge accepted credit for them during his life. In 1814, John Taylor revealed Jefferson's authorship; Breckinridge's grandson, John C. Breckinridge, wrote Jefferson for confirmation of Taylor's claims. Cautioning that {{the passage of time}} and his failing memory might cause him to inaccurately recount the details, Jefferson responded that he, Breckinridge, Wilson Nicholas, and possibly James Madison met at Monticello, at a date Jefferson could not recall, to discuss the need for resolutions denouncing the Alien and Sedition Acts. They decided that Jefferson would pen the resolutions and that Breckinridge would introduce them in the Kentucky legislature upon his return to that state.|$|E
5000|$|Upon its release, {{the song}} was met with mixed reviews from music critics. Jim Donnett of YNaija {{reviewed}} the track and said that [...] "Wizkid sounds a bit rushed, <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> <b>he's</b> losing timing on the beat and then later on, clashing harmonies with Don Jazzy. Phyno on the other hand, is genius. He gives a self composed, on point delivery and in his expected local dialect." ...|$|R

50|$|Mezhirov was a {{prominent}} figure in the Soviet literary establishment, although his allegiances and associations were varied. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>he</b> was close to fellow Jewish-Russian Boris Yampolsky, Kazakh writer Olzhas Suleimenov, and Russian cultural ultranationalist and critic Vadim Kozhinov. Mezhirov associated with younger writers Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Tatyana Glushkova (known for her nationalist views in the mid-1980s, according to Shrayer) and Evgeny Reyn, who was censored in the Soviet Union until the mid-1980s.|$|R
5|$|Orochimaru {{also appears}} in two light novels from the franchise. In Sasuke's Story, he aids Sasuke in a mission by {{providing}} him information of his target. Meanwhile, in Konoha Hiden {{he makes a}} cameo congratulating Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuga for their wedding. He also appears in the spin-off Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring, which takes place 15 years after the main story, {{but he has a}} younger appearance, much to the confusion of the main characters. In the manga sequel , Orochimaru creates an artificial human based on his DNA, whom he names Mitsuki, and refers to him as his son. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> <b>he</b> sends Mitsuki to live in Konoha after helping Mitsuki find his independence and decide what path in life he prefers. In , Orochimaru is seen watching his son with his teammates.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{was born}} in Normandy and became a monk at Canterbury, and a {{chaplain}} to Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> <b>he</b> received an education, {{but it is not}} known where or who he studied with. The first notice of him in history is as a monk at Christ Church. He was a colleague of Thomas Becket while they both worked for Theobald. In 1157 he was appointed prior of St. Martin's priory in Dover. St. Martin's was a Benedictine priory and a dependent house of Christ Church Cathedral Priory in Canterbury, the cathedral chapter of the archbishops of Canterbury. Right before Becket's death Richard was employed by Becket to meet with Henry the Young King, but was unsuccessful in the attempt. After Becket's death, Richard took charge of Becket's body, and arranged for an immediate burial in Canterbury Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Few {{other details}} are {{known about the}} singer's childhood. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>he</b> met another blind musician, Madkin Butler, who had a {{powerful}} singing and preaching style that influenced Johnson's own vocal delivery and repertoire. Adam Booker, a blind minister interviewed by the blues historian Samuel Charters in the 1950s, recalled that while visiting his father in Hearne, Johnson would perform religious songs on street corners with a tin cup tied to the neck of his Stella guitar to collect money. Occasionally, Johnson would play on the same street as Blind Lemon Jefferson, but {{the extent of the}} two songsters' involvement with each other is unknown. In 1926 or early 1927, Johnson established an unregistered marriage with Willie B. Harris, who occasionally sang on the street with him and at benefits for the Marlin Church of God in Christ with Johnson accompanied on piano. From the relationship, Johnson had a daughter, Sam Faye Johnson Kelly, in 1931. The blues guitarist L. C. Robinson recalled that his sister Anne also claimed to have been married to Johnson in the late 1920s.|$|E
5000|$|Byrnes {{says of his}} character, [...] "Joe's {{been through}} the wringer. (…) It {{would be hard for}} people to be around him too much, I think. He's kind of a loner, because <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>he's</b> got to have some serious demons. These people have {{witnessed}} this crazy stuff; {{how do you deal with}} it ? It's hard to be ordinary. Joe is extra ordinary sic, he's really ordinary. I mean that in a good way." ...|$|R

5|$|Poe {{may have}} become engaged to Sarah Elmira Royster before he {{registered}} at the one-year-old University of Virginia in February 1826 to study ancient and modern languages. The university, in its infancy, was established on the ideals of its founder Thomas Jefferson. It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco, and alcohol, but these rules were generally ignored. Jefferson had enacted a system of student self-government, allowing students {{to choose their own}} studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty. The unique system was still in chaos, and there was a high dropout rate. During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts. Poe claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, and procure and furnish a dormitory. Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe's debts increased. Poe gave up on the university after a year, but did not feel welcome returning to Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart Royster had married Alexander Shelton. He traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper writer. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> <b>he</b> started using the pseudonym Henri Le Rennet.|$|E
25|$|<b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>he</b> {{was made}} a Knight of the Garter. Following his {{attainder}} his first wife divorced him (if they ever married) so he married again to Anne Holland, daughter of John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter.|$|E
25|$|Sometime {{after he}} stopped, Bryant removed Pears from the boot and handcuffed {{him to a}} stair rail within the house. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> <b>he</b> also set the BMW on fire. He is {{believed}} to have arrived at the house by about 2:00p.m.|$|E

25|$|Being {{the eldest}} {{member of the}} library committee, she acts like a big sister to {{everyone}} else, to Yua in particular. Graceful and smart, Sayuki {{is the object of}} Tomoki's affections; however, he has not confessed to her, though <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> <b>he</b> almost did. Sayuki has a mysterious aura, and may be bearing some secrets of her own.|$|E
25|$|A {{forensic}} {{profile of}} the killer suggested {{that it would be}} a young man, in his mid- to late twenties, single, living either alone or with his mother. He would have been a loner, possibly with a drug problem, and may have been in psychiatric care <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point.</b> <b>He</b> would also have had a history of anti-social behaviour and would be unlikely to have had any intimate relationships. The profile indicated a likelihood he would kill again.|$|E
50|$|Conlin {{was fond}} of Florence, Italy, where he had an {{apartment}} for his trips abroad, and adopted the city for his stage name. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> after <b>he</b> became famous under this name, he secured {{the legal right to}} it.|$|R
50|$|<b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> around 1890, <b>he</b> {{remarried}} to a Japanese woman, Uta Saito, {{with whom}} he had a daughter.|$|R
50|$|Amis {{engages in}} several forms of reverse {{discourse}} including reverse dialogue, reverse narrative, and reverse explanation. Amis's {{use of these}} techniques is aimed to create an unsettling and irrational aura for the reader; indeed, one of the recurrent themes in the novel is the narrator's persistent misinterpretation of events. For example, he simply accepts that people wait for an hour in a physician's waiting room after being examined, although <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>he</b> has doubts about this tradition. Relationships are portrayed with stormy beginnings that slowly fade into pleasant romances. Although the narrator accepts all this, he is puzzled and feels that the world does not really make sense.|$|R
25|$|Although Shockley {{was never}} {{diagnosed}} by psychiatrists, historians characterized Shockley's {{state of mind}} in 1956–1957 as paranoia or autism. All phone calls were recorded, and the staff {{was not allowed to}} share their results with each other, which was not feasible since they all worked in a small building. Shockley, not trusting his employees, was sending their reports to Bell Labs for double-checking. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>he</b> sent the entire lab for a lie detector test, though everyone refused.|$|E
25|$|Edge opposed {{prohibition}} {{and voted}} against the Volstead Act. In 1924, he ran for reelection advocating {{the repeal of the}} Eighteenth Amendment, which New Jersey had approved in 1922, after the end of his term as governor. He proposed a number of bills that would relax prohibition, including legislation authorizing the sale of alcoholic beverages with an alcohol content of 3%, and another bill to legalize the sale of beer with alcohol content of 2.75%. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>he</b> supported practically every anti-prohibition movement in the Senate.|$|E
25|$|There is a vida of Jordan which {{exists in}} several manuscripts, some with an {{accompanying}} razo. Like typical vidas, it {{tell us where}} he was from and whom he loved. He was from Pena d'Albeges (modern Penne). <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>he</b> had {{a love affair with}} Elis (Lucia) de Montfort, wife of Guillem de Gordon (c. 1165) and then Bernart de Casnac (c. 1214).

50|$|Curtis Howe Springer {{was born}} December 2, 1896, and hailed from Birmingham, Alabama. He {{was married to}} Mary Louise Berkebile.

The implication is that the old man is in the wrong movie theater, probably one screening art films.|$|R
25|$|Friedrich Röth served {{originally}} in {{an artillery}} regiment. He was seriously wounded {{early in the}} war. Once he was again fit for duty, he was commissioned, in May 1915. He transferred to the aerial service, only to be severely injured in a crash. Because of his extended recuperation, he did not win his wings until early 1917. His initial assignment was to a Bavarian artillery spotting unit, FA(A) 296. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> <b>he</b> served in Jagdstaffel 34, but did not down any enemies until {{he was assigned to}} Jagdstaffel 23.|$|E
25|$|Benny's comic persona {{changed over}} the course of his career. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>he</b> {{developed}} a miserly persona. This stage character was everything that Jack Benny was not: cheap, petty, vain and self-congratulatory. His comic rendering of these traits was the linchpin to the success of his show. Benny set himself up as comedic foil, allowing his supporting characters to draw laughs at the expense of his own flaws. With his humanism and vulnerability in an era where few male characters were allowed such character traits, Benny made what could have been unlikable into an everyman character.|$|E
25|$|Collaert {{was born}} on 13 June 1761 at Liège in the Austrian Netherlands. His parents were Marie Joseph Ferdinand, Baron of Collaert, a one time {{adjutant}} to a Prussian prince, and Marianna Hauben.
