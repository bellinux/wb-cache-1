5|$|A folk tale from Barra {{tells of}} a lonely kelpie that {{transforms}} itself into a handsome young man to woo <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>young</b> girl it was determined to take for its wife. But the girl recognises the young man as a kelpie and removes his silver necklace (his bridle) while he sleeps. The kelpie immediately reverts to its equine form, and the girl takes it home to her father's farm, where it is put {{to work for a}} year. At the end of that time the girl rides the kelpie to consult a wise man, who tells her to return the silver necklace. Once again transformed into the handsome young man she had first met the wise man asks the kelpie whether if given the choice it would choose to be a kelpie or a mortal. The kelpie in turn asks the girl whether, if he were a man, she would agree to be his wife. She confirms that she would, after which the kelpie chooses to become a mortal man, and the pair are married.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "She" [...] {{was shot in}} Los Angeles. Ocean posted several behind the scene photos of the video shoot onto his own {{personal}} Tumblr account, including pictures [...] "with <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>young</b> thing as his leading lady." [...] Ocean plays [...] "double duty as a cop and {{the man of the}} house, almost unrecognizable in a white wig and drab attire. In one of the more chilling images, Tyler stares into the camera as a gun is pointed at his head, wearing the same black contacts he sported in his viral sensation “Yonkers” video." ...|$|E

[...] As Michael decides on choosing that prize, Katy Moore (Amy Adams), <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>young</b> purse saleswoman, comes into the office to sell her wares. When Michael sees her, he offers to let her set up shop in the conference room, which catches every male's eye.

Roy Anderson mentions that he would go for her if he were not dating Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), and an angry Pam corrects him that they are engaged.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{from the}} first, Yiddish theater drew {{a level of}} theater {{criticism}} comparable to any other European theater of its time. For example, Bercovici cites a [...] "brochure" [...] by one G. Abramski, published in 1877, that described and gave critiques of all of Goldfaden's plays of that year. Abramski speculated that the present day might be for Yiddish theater a moment comparable to the Elizabethan era for English theater. He discussed what a Yiddish theater ought to be, noted its many sources (ranging from Purim plays to circus pantomime), and praised its incorporation of strong female roles. He also criticized where he saw weaknesses, noting how unconvincingly a male actor played the mother in Shmendrik, or remarking of the play Di shtume kale (The Mute Bride) — a work that Goldfaden apparently wrote to accommodate <b>a</b> <b>pretty,</b> <b>young</b> actress who in the performance was too nervous to deliver her lines — that the only evidence of Goldfaden's authorship was his name.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, the {{hardcore}} pornography genre {{introduced the}} stereotypical cumshot (also {{known as the}} money shot) scene as a central element (leitmotif) of the hardcore film, in which the male actor ejaculates in a way ensuring maximum visibility of the act itself. These scenes may involve the female actor [...] "calling for" [...] the shot to be directed at some specific part of her body. Now facial cumshots are regularly portrayed in pornographic films, videos, magazines and internet web sites. Hugo Ohira, director of marketing for Silvercash, rhetorically asks [...] "Who doesn't like spewing their load on <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>young</b> face?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Adagio: {{essentially}} {{a sort of}} cross between a dance act and a juggling act, consisting usually of a male dancer who threw <b>a</b> slim, <b>pretty</b> <b>young</b> girl around. Some aspects of modern dance choreography evolved from Adagio acts.|$|R

2500|$|Scotsman arts editor Andrew Eaton-Lewis {{suggested}} that [...] "there's something troubling {{about the fact}} that the case against this painting is essentially that it makes <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>young</b> woman look less pretty and less young." [...] Eaton-Lewis commented that [...] "a portrait which makes Middleton appear older, more distinguished, and more ordinary is judged to be unfit for purpose" [...] was [...] "depressing". Another art critic, Fisun Güner, a freelance visual arts writer, also criticised the painting, mentioning that the hair is painted in a spread out wavy cascade which starts to look like an advertisement for a shampoo. Fisun makes the observation that the blouse in the big-bow shape, which she is wearing covered up to the neck, makes her appear [...] "stiff and rather straight-jacketed". However, Fisun believed the eyes look bright and lively and the jewellery, which she is shown wearing, stated to belong to her mother-in-law, are earrings made of sapphire and diamond, which bring out an animated look in the portrait.|$|E
2500|$|Gilbert sought {{authenticity}} in the Japanese setting, costumes, {{movements and}} gestures of the actors. To that end, Gilbert engaged {{some of the}} Japanese at the Knightsbridge village to advise on the production and to coach the actors. [...] "The Directors and Native Inhabitants" [...] of the village were thanked in the programme that was distributed on the first night. Sullivan inserted into his score, as [...] "Miya sama", a version of a Japanese military march song, called [...] "Ton-yare Bushi", composed in the Meiji Era. [...] Giacomo Puccini later incorporated the same song into Madama Butterfly [...] as the introduction to Yamadori, ancor le pene. [...] The characters' names in the play are not Japanese names, but rather (in many cases) English baby-talk or simply dismissive exclamations. For instance, <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>young</b> thing is named Pitti-Sing; the beautiful heroine is named Yum-Yum; the pompous officials are Pooh-Bah and Pish-Tush; the hero is called Nanki-Poo, baby-talk for [...] "handkerchief". The headsman's name, Ko-Ko, {{is similar to that}} of the scheming Ko-Ko-Ri-Ko in Ba-ta-clan by Jacques Offenbach.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, what {{a monster}} you make him out!" [...] And Rosier faced the Countess, who advanced, {{in front of}} Pansy, with an {{animation}} partly due perhaps {{to the fact that}} she perceived her sister-in-law to be engaged in conversation with <b>a</b> very <b>pretty</b> <b>young</b> man.|$|R
