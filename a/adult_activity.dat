5|$|In Europe, {{pyrethroids}} and neonicotinoids {{have been}} used against B. rufimanus. Because of the faba bean crop biology and its attraction to pollinators at flowering stage, restrictions on pesticides uses have been introduced in Europe. It is particularly advised to spray in absence of pollinators {{in the early morning}} and evening. In addition, due to B. rufimanus biology, a temperature threshold combined with crop development stage can be used to increase the success of chemical treatments. Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days after treatment (Arvalis, 2016). Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days after treatment. The end of blooming indicates the end of <b>adult</b> <b>activity</b> in the field. This stage is therefore a threshold marking the end of insecticide application and occurs no later than five days after last blooming. Forecasting systems (Bruchi-LIS, Arvalis, France and BruchidCast, Syngenta, UK) have been developed to optimize insecticide applications based on temperature and crop stage.|$|E

40|$|Ethnographic {{reports on}} a world sample of {{societies}} were used for rating frequency of participation by children in <b>adult</b> <b>activities</b> and degree of permissive treatment of children. Although {{the correlation between the}} two measures of childhood is close to zero, frequent participation by children in <b>adult</b> <b>activities</b> has different meanings depending on whether children are treated permissively or puni-tively. In societies where permissiveness is low, frequent participa-tion by children is correlated with several measures of low cultural complexity, indicating greater need for child labor. In societies where permissiveness is high, frequent participation by children is correlated with absence of an initiation ceremony for adolescent girls and with a compact rather than dispersed settlement, indicat-ing more opportunities for children to be granted adult privileges. Frequent participation by children in <b>adult</b> <b>activities</b> also has different meanings depending on whether the community is inde-pendent or subordinate to a government. Frequent participation by children in <b>adult</b> <b>activities</b> has several advantages. Children can contribute needed labor. Family cohe-sion may be strengthened by participation of children. Children usually desire adult privileges, such as sharing enjoyable experi-ences with adults and staying up late at night...|$|R

50|$|The {{breeding}} season extends from May to June {{with a single}} clutch of 5-6 eggs being laid usually in June or July, which hatch {{in the late summer}} months of July or August. During mating no pair bond is formed between adults. A single clutch is usually laid per year but in the warmer climates towards the south, it is possible for a female to spawn up to two clutches per year. Birthing and egg-laying occur in an underground burrow, although no nest structure is formed. Egg incubation is estimated to be between five and seven weeks.

50|$|Bet hedging is {{characterized}} through individuals that minimize reproductive success of variance between years. Macrotera portalis practices bet hedging because only a certain portion of bees emerge {{in any given}} year, with many remaining in diapause. Although this leads to certain years of lower reproductive success, in years of low resources some offspring will survive and thus the advantages of lower variance may outweigh the disadvantages of reduced average fitness in diverse environments. Since M. portalis lives in a desert environment, of which conditions are extremely unpredictable, the between year variation is the greatest than any other biome with very minimal rainfall annually, {{it is likely that}} bet hedging is displayed within the species. Overwintering of desert bees have limited <b>adult</b> <b>activity</b> and reproduction during {{a short period of time}} after the desert rainy season. Larvae are small, exposed to high temperatures, low humidity, buried in the soil, subject to predation, desiccation, and pathogens.|$|E

50|$|The {{life cycle}} of T. lugens is {{completed}} in two years. Adults start their activity soon after snowmelt and are active {{until the beginning of}} autumn (end of September in the Sierra Nevada). Most adults that are active {{at the beginning of the}} season are the individuals that emerged the preceding year and have survived the winter in diapause. Mating and egg laying occur along the whole period of <b>adult</b> <b>activity.</b> At the end of the summer, approximately 15 days to one month before the snow has completely covered the study area, individuals start overwintering under large plants or stones. Overwintering is common in species of Timarcha, as well as other chrysomelids, and it occurs in most high mountain species, which are active only during the warmest period of the year. The short periods of activity (usually restricted to summertime) limits the breeding season to a few months in which these species have to maturate reproductive organs, mate, breed, and develop.|$|E
