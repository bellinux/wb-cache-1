5|$|In February 1902, {{before the}} start of the {{baseball}} season, Young served as <b>a</b> <b>pitching</b> coach at Harvard University. The sixth-grade graduate instructing Harvard students delighted Boston newspapers. The following year, Young coached at Mercer University, in Macon, Georgia during the spring. The team went on to win the Georgia state championship in 1903, 1904, and 1905.|$|E
5|$|Beckett {{recorded}} his 100th career win on July 12, 2009, pitching a complete game shutout against the Kansas City Royals at Fenway Park. On August 7, 2009, against the New York Yankees, he engaged in <b>a</b> <b>pitching</b> duel with former Marlins teammate A. J. Burnett {{that turned into}} a fifteen-inning, five-hour-and-thirty-three-minute game. He threw seven shutout innings, Burnett threw seven and two thirds. The Red Sox eventually lost {{the game in the}} bottom of the 15th, when Alex Rodriguez hit a walk-off two run home run. He was 17–6 on the season, with a 3.86 ERA in 32 starts. He lost his one start in the postseason, to the Angels in game two of the 2009 ALDS.|$|E
5|$|During {{a game in}} 2013 {{between the}} Houston Astros and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Culbreth, acting as the crew chief for the game, made an {{incorrect}} call in the 7th inning, for which he later received a two-game suspension and a fine. Houston manager Bo Porter made <b>a</b> <b>pitching</b> change, and Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia called for a pinch-hitter. Porter attempted to make a second pitching change and Scioscia immediately contested it. After discussing the call with his umpiring crew, Culbreth allowed the pitching change, violating the MLB rule 3.05(b). He did not serve his suspension immediately, and he continued working regular games in the weeks following the incident.|$|E
50|$|Further {{showing his}} {{toughness}} as a ballplayer, Elberfeld {{was not afraid}} of being hit by <b>a</b> <b>pitch.</b> He led the American League in being hit by <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> in 1903 and 1911 and was among the league leaders in the category nine times. In 1911, {{he was hit by}} <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> 25 times, setting an American League record that was not broken until 1986 when Don Baylor was hit by <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> 35 times. In his career, Elberfeld was hit by <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> 165 times - 13th most in the history of Major League Baseball.|$|R

5|$|Smith was a {{candidate}} for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame for 15 years, but failed to ever reach the 75% support threshold needed for election, peaking at 50%. After {{the end of his}} major league career, Smith spent time working as <b>a</b> <b>pitching</b> instructor at the minor-league level with the San Francisco Giants. He then served as the pitching coach for the South Africa national baseball team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic and 2009 World Baseball Classic. Lee currently continues his job as a minor-league roving pitching instructor for the Giants.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Linde pitched for the Oklahoma City Indians, the Indians {{minor league}} affiliate of the Texas League. He {{spent most of}} the season with Oklahoma City, and in <b>a</b> <b>pitching</b> appearance in August, threw a no-hitter and narrowly missed pitching a perfect game. In 32 appearances for Oklahoma City, Linde won 14 games, lost 13, and had an ERA of 2.85 in 202 innings pitched. At the end of the minor league season, Linde was called up to the Indians' major league roster along with Ernest Groth in order to build up the end of the bullpen.|$|E
5|$|Feller {{began to}} play American Legion Baseball {{in the nearby town}} of Adel at the age of 10; the {{following}} year, his father built a baseball diamond on the farm. The diamond was named Oak View Park and included <b>a</b> <b>pitching</b> mound, scoreboard and concessions area. Feller and other players formed a team, the Oakviews, consisting of semi-pro and high school ballplayers. Feller played primarily as a shortstop or outfielder, and emulated Rogers Hornsby's batting stance. From the age of 15, he began to pitch for the Oakviews after a starting pitcher was injured; while doing so, Feller continued to play American Legion baseball. His catcher during this period was Nile Kinnick, who later {{became a member of the}} College Football Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|In 1901, {{the rival}} American League {{declared}} major league status {{and set about}} raiding National League rosters. Young left St. Louis and joined the American League's Boston Americans for a $3,500 contract ($ today). Young would remain with the Boston team until 1909. In {{his first year in}} the American League, Young was dominant. Pitching to Criger, who had also jumped to Boston, Young led the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA, thus earning the colloquial AL Triple Crown for pitchers. Young won almost 42% of his team's games in 1901, accounting for 33 of his team's 79 wins. In February 1902, {{before the start of the}} baseball season, Young served as <b>a</b> <b>pitching</b> coach at Harvard University. The sixth-grade graduate instructing Harvard students delighted Boston newspapers. The following year, Young coached at Mercer University during the spring.

5|$|Linde's {{first taste}} of minor league action came in 1942, when he signed with the Green Bay Bluejays of the Wisconsin State League. His {{performances}} that season included a near-no-hitter that {{was lost in the}} ninth inning in a 5–2 victory over the Fond du Lac Panthers. Linde was also given the most valuable player award for a week in July after <b>a</b> <b>pitching</b> performance, also against Fond du Lac, in which he struck out 14 batters in a 5–0 shutout victory. He finished the season with 13 wins, eight losses, and a 2.91 ERA in 22 pitching appearances. After the season ended, the league folded temporarily, and Linde enlisted with the United States Army Air Forces to serve in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Ruffing {{dropped out}} of school as a child to work in a coal mine in his native Illinois. He played for the mine's company {{baseball}} team as an outfielder and first baseman. After he lost four toes from his left foot in a mining accident, he became unable to run in the field, and switched to pitching. He played in minor league baseball in 1923 and 1924 before making his MLB debut with the Red Sox. After struggling with Boston, pitching to a 36–93 win–loss record, the Red Sox traded Ruffing to the Yankees, where he became successful, pitching as the Yankees' ace through 1946. After one season with the White Sox, Ruffing retired from pitching to work in coaching. He served as a bullpen coach for the White Sox, <b>a</b> <b>pitching</b> coach for the New York Mets, and a scout and minor league instructor for the Cleveland Indians.|$|E

5|$|The Mets {{promoted}} deGrom to {{the major}} leagues on May 12, 2014, after Gonzalez Germen {{was placed on the}} disabled list. The Mets planned to use deGrom in relief, but an injury to Dillon Gee required the Mets to insert him into their starting rotation. DeGrom made his major league debut on May 15 against cross-town rival New York Yankees in Citi Field. He faced fellow rookie Chase Whitley, also making his MLB debut. He pitched seven innings, allowing only one run and striking out six, but the Yankees shut out the Mets and won 1–0. DeGrom also collected his first MLB hit in the game in his first career at bat. It was the first hit by a Mets pitcher in the 2014 season ending an 0-for-64 hitless streak, the worst collective mark by <b>a</b> <b>pitching</b> staff to begin a season in MLB history.|$|E
5|$|The Indians hired Bill McKechnie as <b>a</b> <b>{{pitching}}</b> coach {{after the}} 1946 season. One {{of his first}} jobs was to work with Gromek during the offseason and improve his pitching due to his struggles the prior year, in particular against left-handed batters. The Indians talked with the Yankees during the offseason about making a trade for second baseman Joe Gordon. The teams settled on Gromek as the main piece originally, but Joe DiMaggio suggested the team trade for Reynolds instead. Gromek remained on the Indians for the 1947 season as a result, but {{was moved to the}} bullpen instead of remaining in the starting rotation. The highlight of his season came on July 1 in relief of Feller, who left the game due to injury. In the game against the Browns, he threw 7.2 innings and allowed two runs in a 9–3 victory in what was his longest appearance of the season at that time. For the year, Gromek pitched in 29 games, starting 7, and had a 2–5 record and a 3.74 ERA in 84.1 innings pitched, his first full season in which he pitched under 150 innings.|$|E

50|$|A batter hit by <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> is not {{credited}} with a hit or at bat, but is {{credited with}} a time on base and a plate appearance; therefore, being hit by <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> does not increase or decrease a player's batting average but does increase his on-base percentage. A batter hit by <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> {{with the bases loaded}} is also credited with an RBI per MLB rule 10.04(a)(2). <b>A</b> <b>pitch</b> ruled <b>a</b> hit by <b>pitch</b> is recorded as a ball in the pitcher's pitch count, since by definition the ball must be outside the strike zone and not have been swung at.|$|R

25|$|April 15, 1968 saw <b>a</b> <b>pitching</b> duel for the ages. The Astros' Don Wilson and the Mets' Tom Seaver {{faced each}} other in <b>a</b> <b>pitching</b> duel that lasted six hours. Seaver went ten innings, {{allowing}} no walks and just two hits. Wilson went nine innings, allowing five hits and three walks. After the starters exited, eleven relievers (seven for the Mets and four for the Astros) tried to end the game. The game finally ended in the 24th inning when Aspromonte hit a shot toward Mets shortstop Al Weis. Weis had been perfect all night at short, {{but he was not}} quick enough to make the play. The ball zipped into left field, allowing Norm Miller to score.|$|E

50|$|In the {{language}} of combinatorics, the Forte numbers correspond to the binary bracelets of length 12: that is, equivalence classes of binary sequences of length 12 under the operations of cyclic permutation and reversal. In this correspondence, a one in a binary sequence corresponds to <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> that is present in <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> class set, and a zero in a binary sequence corresponds to <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> that is absent. The rotation of binary sequences corresponds to transposition of chords, and the reversal of binary sequences corresponds to inversion of chords. The most compact form of <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> class set is the lexicographically maximal sequence within the corresponding equivalence class of sequences.|$|R
