2500|$|Ford {{obtained}} ample {{federal funds}} for his district through his membership on the House Ways and Means Committee. He focused his work in Congress on helping lower income constituents. He advocated for increased federal government assistance for job training, health care, and unemployment supplemental benefits with welfare as a safety net. He supported Democratic President Carter's initiatives to rebuild central cities, and opposed cuts to programs such as Medicare and food stamps that were passed during the administration of Republican President Ronald Reagan. Ford proposed comprehensive welfare reform legislation to gradually transition recipients with children {{over the age of}} six from welfare to work. The legislation had a high start up cost due to the education <b>and</b> <b>job</b> <b>training</b> aspects, and was opposed by the Reagan administration.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, {{homeless}} people began appearing {{in large numbers}} in the city, the result of multiple factors including the closing of state institutions for the mentally ill, the Reagan administration drastically cutting Section 8 housing benefits, and social changes which increased the availability of addictive drugs. Combined with San Francisco's attractive environment and generous welfare policies the problem soon became endemic. Mayor Art Agnos (1988–92) {{was the first to}} attack the problem, and not the last; it is a top issue for San Franciscans even today. His program, Beyond Shelter, became the basis for federal programs and was recognized by Harvard for Innovations in Local Government. Agnos allowed the homeless to camp in the Civic Center park after the Loma Prieta earthquake that made over 1,000 SRO's uninhabitable, which led to its title of [...] "Camp Agnos." [...] His opponent used this to attack Agnos in 1991, an election Agnos lost. Frank Jordan launched the [...] "MATRIX" [...] program the next year, which aimed to displace the homeless through aggressive police action. And it did displace them-to the rest of the city. His successor, Willie Lewis Brown, Jr., was able to largely ignore the problem, riding on the strong economy into a second term. Later, mayor Gavin Newsom created the controversial [...] "Care Not Cash" [...] program and policy on the homeless, which calls for ending the city's generous welfare policies towards the homeless and instead placing them in affordable housing and requiring them to attend city funded drug rehabilitation <b>and</b> <b>job</b> <b>training</b> programs.|$|E
