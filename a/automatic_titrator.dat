40|$|In this {{research}} project {{we plan to}} determine the rate of oxidation of pyrite associated with coaly particles (coal slurry solid) when the pH of the surrounding environment is held at approximately 7. 8. Coaly particles that contain pyrite are generated during the preparation of Illinois Basin coal for market. These particles are discharged to an impoundment, which eventually must be reclaimed. The purpose for reclamation is either to prevent the generation of acidic solution as the pyrite in the coal slurry solid reacts with air, or to prevent the migration of the acidic solution to a groundwater aquifer. The reclamation is usually accomplished by covering the impoundment with a four-foot-thick layer of topsoil. One possible alternative method for reclamation of a coal slurry impoundment is to mix in alkaline residue from the fluidized-bed combustion of coal. This codisposal would slow the production of acid and would also neutralize any acid produced. If the codisposal method {{is found to be}} environmentally acceptable, it will save the coal mining companies part of their cost of reclamation, and also provide a safe and useful disposal outlet for a portion of the residue that is generated by the fluidized-bed combustion of coal. During this quarter we purchased and set up two <b>automatic</b> <b>titrators,</b> which will be used in determining the rate of pyrite oxidation at nearly neutral pH. The titrators will provide a means for maintaining the pH at the desired level. The rate at which sulfate ion is produced as a result of pyrite oxidation will be used to measure the amount of pyrite oxidized over time...|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of high-precision <b>automatic</b> <b>titrators</b> {{operating}} in pH stat mode, measuring the mass balance of protons in solid-solution mixtures against the pH of natural and synthetic polyelectrolytes is now routine. However, titration curves of complex molecules typically lack obvious inflection points, which complicates their analysis despite the high-precision measurements. The calculation of site densities and median proton affinity constants (pK) from such data can lead to considerable covariance between fit parameters. Knowing the number of independent parameters that can be freely varied during the least-squares minimization of a model fit to titration data is necessary to improve the model's applicability. This number was calculated for natural organic matter by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to a reference data set of 47 independent titration curves from fulvic and humic acids measured at I= 0. 1 M. The complete data set was reconstructed statistically from pH 3. 5 to 9. 8 with only six parameters, compared to seven or eight generally adjusted with common semi-empirical speciation models for organic matter, and explains correlations that occur with the higher number of parameters. Existing proton-binding models are not necessarily overparametrized, but instead titration data lack the sensitivity needed to quantify the full set of binding properties of humic materials. Modelindependent conditional pKvalues can be obtained directly from the derivative of titration data, and this approach is the most conservative. The apparent proton-binding constants of the 23 fulvic acids (FA) and 24 humic acids (HA) derived from a high-quality polynomial parametrization of the data set are pKH,COOH(FA) = 4. 18 (0. 21, pKH,Ph-OH(FA) = 9. 29 (0. 33, pKH,COOH(HA) = 4. 49 (0. 18, and pKH,Ph-OH(HA) = 9. 29 (0. 38.

The polyDADMAC/HS mass ratio at the IEP gives information on the HS charge density and from the pH changes in solution an estimate of the charge regulation in the HS-polyDADMAC complex can be obtained. In general, for polyDADMAC-HS complexes an increase in the dissociation of the acid groups of HS is found (charge regulation).

40|$|An {{integrated}} analyzer {{based on}} the multisyringe flow injection analysis approach is proposed for the automated determination of dissolved oxygen in seawater. The entire Winkler method including precipitation of manganese(II) hydroxide, fixation of dissolved oxygen, dissolution of the oxidized manganese hydroxide precipitate, and generation of iodine and tri-iodide ion are in-line effected within the flow network. Spectrophotometric quantification of iodine and tri-iodide at the isosbestic wavelength of 466 nm renders enhanced method reliability. The calibration function is linear up to 19 mg L− 1 dissolved oxygen and an injection frequency of 17 per hour is achieved. The multisyringe system features a highly satisfying signal stability with repeatabilities of 2. 2 % RSD that make it suitable for continuous determination of dissolved oxygen in seawater. Compared to the manual starch-end-point titrimetric Winkler method and early reported automated systems, concentrations and consumption of reagents and sample are reduced up to hundredfold.

40|$|A {{method has}} been evolved {{for the study}} of the {{kinetics}} of the dehydration of carbonyl compounds. The basis of this method is shown in the reaction scheme given below: OH   /  C /     slow     →     C /   = O + H 2 O OH C /   = O + scavenger   fast     →     adduct The scavengers used were semicarbazide, hydroxylamine, phenylhydrazine and sulphite.

Another reaction scheme suggested by earlier workers 1 as a possible method of studying the kinetics of the dehydration of formaldehyde was investigated and shown both on theoretical and practical grounds to be of no value in providing kinetic data. This scheme was as shown below: OH     / H 2 C       slow     ⇋     HCHO   + H 2 O OH involatile           volatile           ↓ fast         to gas stream The scavenger techniques were used to study the kinetics of the dehydration of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. These reactions are subject to general acid-base catalysts. Formaldehyde was studied in detail, a large number of catalysts of varying structures, charge types etc. being investigated [2, 3, 4. ] →. Acetaldehyde had already been extensively investigated by previous workers. The present work gave results in good agreement with the earlier work. This work was however of special interest in that recent work by Gruen and MoTigue 5 had raised doubts as to the validity of the "thermal maximum" method which had been employed in obtaining the majority of the previous acetaldehyde results. The results obtained for a wide range of catalysts for formaldehyde conformed with one exception, azide, to two single Brönsted relationships to within log ± 0. 5 over sixteen pK units. These relationships were: Acid catalysis: (12 catalysts studied) k A  p   = 0. 46 [q k  p] 0. 23 Base catalysis: (29 catalysts) k B  q   = 2. 0 x 10 - 4 [ p q k] 0. 40 where k A and k B are the catalytic constants in 1. mole - 1 sec - 1, p and q the statistical factors and k the conventional acid-base strength of the catalyst. The types of catalysts studied included carboxylic acids, nitrogen compounds and inorganic acids, e. g. HF, H 2 AsO 4 −, H 6 TeO 6. In the light of these catalytic results the general range of validity of the Brösted relationships is discussed. The effects of statistical factors steric and charge effects are also reviewed. The formaldehyde results are compared with those from other carbonyl hydration studies. The somewhat anomalous carbon dioxide hydration results of Sharma and Danckwerta 6 are discussed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Each group consisted of 8 N-mari rats of both sexes, weighing 246. 6 &#x 002 B;/- 9. 2 g. Hypo- and hyperthyroid states were induced by administration of methimazole (500 mg/L H 2 O) and thyroxin (200 microg/L H 2 O) respectively, in drinking water. All animals were deprived of food, but not of water 24 hours before the experiments. After anesthetization with sodium thiopental (50 mg/kg body weight, ip), tracheotomy and laparatomy, gastric secretions were collected through a cannula introduced via the duodenum. Gastric distension was induced by the injection of Ringer solution in stomach (1. 5 cm(3) / 100 g body weight). RESULTS: Acid secretions, which were measured by <b>automatic</b> <b>titrator</b> in the hypothyroid, hyperthyroid and control groups were 8 &#x 002 B;/- 0. 2, 14. 6 &#x 002 B;/- 1. 9 and 10. 2 &#x 002 B;/- 0. 1 micromol/ 15 min, respectively. Pepsin secretions were 4. 4 &#x 002 B;/- 0. 5, 9. 09 &#x 002 B;/- 0. 4 and 6. 1 &#x 002 B;/- 0. 1 mg/ 15 min. in respective groups. There were statistically significant differences in both series between control {{and the other two}} groups. CONCLUSION: The results from the measurements of thyroid-stimulating hormones and T 4 hormones showed that increased or decreased thyroid function can significantly affect gastric distension-induced acid and pepsin secretion...|$|E
40|$|In a {{comparative}} study of urinary calcium methods, many of the recently proposed procedures proved either impractical or invalidin our hands. A preliminary isolation of the calcium as the oxalate, followed by perchloric acid oxidation of the oxalate {{seemed to be the}} simplest procedure whereby urinary calcium could be put in a state suitable for chelometric titration. The isolated calcium could also be titrated with considerable precision and accuracy by a modified procedure with a derivative <b>automatic</b> <b>titrator</b> which is available commercially. It was suggested from our observations that too little attention has been directed towards the problems imposed by the occurrence of calcium precipitates in urine. An untreated 24 -hr. urine specimen is not suitable for direct analysis of calcium by chelometric titration, by colorimetric analysis, by emission flame photometry, or by atomic absorption flame photometry because these methods do not give a true meas-ure of the calcium in the precipitate. Boiling for 5 mm. with 1 part concentrated nitric acid to 25 parts urine proved a suitable means for completely dissolving the calcium precipitate. U RINARY CALCIUM DETERMINATIONS probably rate among the lowest in accuracy in the average clinical laboratory. The older methods are tedious and require considerable analytical skill, and some of the re-ceutly proposed procedures do not give a valid measure. Also, it is difficult to obtain a representative sample from specimens which con-tain a calcium precipitate. The older methods generally involve iso-lation of calcium as the oxalate, preceded by ashing or oxidation to remove interference by uric acid and other organic compounds. Per...|$|E
40|$|OraleCarbon dioxide {{released}} in the atmosphere is the supposed principal cause of greenhouse effect, leading to global warming. The present work is a thermodynamic study {{carried out in the}} framework of the ANR CapCO 2 (French National Research Agency) on the treatment of CO 2 in post-combustion effluents. Our objective is to obtain reliable thermodynamic data for different amines in order to correlate absorption properties with amine structure. This work is the continuation and the extension of a study on aqueous solutions of alkanolamines [1, 2]. The enthalpies of solution of CO 2 with aqueous solutions of the selected amines are determined by flow calorimetry at constant temperature and pressure, using a customized flow mixing unit adapted to the SETARAM C- 80 calorimeter [1] at 313. 15 and 353. 15 K for pressures up to 2 MPa. The solution densities [3] are determined at 303. 15 K as function of pressure, up to 2 MPa using an Anton Paar vibrating tube densimeter DMA 512 P. As the enthalpy of protonation of the amine represents the largest contribution [4 - 5] to the enthalpy of solution, the protonation constants of our selected amines were particularly examined. Experimental values were obtained at atmospheric pressure and at temperatures up to 343. 15 K using an <b>automatic</b> <b>titrator</b> from Mettler-Toledo, equipped with a glass electrode. Influence on thermodynamic properties of the amine structure and its basicity will be discussed simultaneously to the intensive parameters. The amines will be classified regarding their efficiency for CO 2 capture, and compared to the MonoEthanolAmine, MEA, considerate as reference in amine-based CO 2 capture process...|$|E
40|$|EDITORIAL COMMENT The {{concentration}} of trypsin in duodenal contents following a Lundh test meal containing 6 % of fat, 5 % protein, and 15 % carbohydrate, {{has been used}} as an index of exocrine pancreatic function. Low concentrations of trypsin are found in pancreatic disease, such as chronic pancreatitis and cancer of the pancreas. The test is particularly useful in the diagnosis of pan-creatic steatorrhoea. The development of methods for estimating pro-teolytic enzymes using specific synthetic substrates has been applied by Lundh (1962) to the estimation of trypsin in duodenal aspirates after a standard test meal. He found that this test, which measures the physiological response of the pancreas to a test meal, rather than its secretory capacity in response to a parenteral stimulus of secretin or pancreozymin, gave useful diagnostic information in pancreatic disease. Results with the test, or modifications of it, have since been reported by Ventzke, Davidson, andGrossman (1964), byHartley, Gambill, Engstrom, and Summerskill (1966), and by Zieve, Mulford, and McHale (1966). We present here our experience using this method in normal subjects and in patients with and without pancreatic disease. Our results confirm that this is a useful test, particularly in the investigation of steatorrhoea. ESTIMATION OF TRYPTIC ACTIVITIES The tryptic activities in the intestinal aspirates were measured using the synthetic substrate N-benzoyl-larginine-ethyl ester (B. A. E. E.). The methods used are published in detail on page 415 (Wiggins, 1967). In the earlier part of the study the time taken to release a known amount of hydrogen ion from the substrate was measured. Later, an <b>automatic</b> <b>titrator</b> was used as a pH stat (Radiometer, Copenhagen) to measure the amount of hydrogen ion liberate...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Manufactured Colas are {{consumed}} universally as soft drinks. Evidence about the acid contents of Cola-beverages {{and its effects}} on teeth is rare. Aim. To assess (i) cola acidity and buffering capacity in vitro, (ii) tooth erosion after swishing with colas in vivo (iii) scanning electron microscopic effects on teeth of colas, and tooth-brush abrasion, and (iv) report a clinical case of erosion from cola consumption. Materials and Methods. (i) We measured six commercially available pop “Cola beverages”, pH, and buffering capacities using a pH-Mettler <b>Automatic</b> <b>Titrator,</b> with weak solution of Sodium Hydroxide (ii) two cohorts, one with teeth, the second without teeth rinsed with aliquots of Cola for 60 seconds. Swished cola samples tested for calcium and phosphorus contents using standardized chemical analytical methods (iii) enamel, dentine, and the enamel-cemental junction from unerupted extracted wisdom teeth were examined with a scanning electron microscope after exposure to colas, and tested for tooth-brush abrasion; (iv) a clinical case of pop cola erosion presentation, are all described. Results. Comparisons among pop colas tested in vitro reveal high acidity with very low pH. Buffering capacities in millilitres of 0. 5 [*]M NaOH needed to increase one pH unit, to pH 5. 5 and pH 7 are reported. Rinsing in vivo with pop cola causes leeching of calcium from teeth; SEM shows dental erosion, and pop-cola consumption induces advanced dental erosion and facilitates abrasion. Conclusions. (i) Pop-Cola acid activity is below the critical pH 5. 5 for tooth dissolution, with high buffering capacities countering neutralization effects of saliva; (ii) calcium is leeched out of teeth after rinsing with pop colas; (iii) SEM evidence explains why chronic exposure to acid pop colas causes dental frangibles; (iv) a clinical case of pop-cola erosion confirms this...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{study to}} {{investigate}} metal chelates as possible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase, copper chelates of 1, 3 diaminopropanol- 2, 1, 3 diaminopropane, and hydroxy- 1 -proline are examined. Since the chelate solutions contain mixtures of species in equilibrium, {{it is necessary to}} calculate the concentrations of pertinent species under experimental conditions. Equations are derived which can be used to calculate the concentrations of individual species in an equilibrium mixture of ligand and copper under fixed conditions of concentration and pH {{with the aid of a}}n IBM 1410 computer. Initial measurements of reaction velocity of enzyme-substrate breakdown to enzyme plus acid products, are made by observing the speed of pH drop with the aid of a Beckman <b>Automatic</b> <b>Titrator.</b> Selection of equilibrium pH values and ligand-metal ratios is dependent on the formation constants calculated for each system. Enzyme kinetic studies are used in an effort to determine the nature of the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. It is found that (a) 1 - 1 ligand-copper chelate inhibit the acetylcholinesterase system, (b) free cupric ion may inhibit the enzyme system if concentrations greater than 1 x 10 - 6 M are present in the equilibrium mixture, (c) coordination vacancies on the metal ion are necessary prerequisites for inhibition, (d) 1 - 1 ligandcopper chelates of 1, 3 diaminopropanol inhibit the enzyme in an essentially 2 ̆ 2 competitive 2 ̆ 2 manner, (e) 1 - 1 ligand-copper chelates of 1, 3 diaminopropane inhibit the enzyme in an essentially 2 ̆ 2 noncompetitive 2 ̆ 2 manner, (f) 1 - 1 ligand-copper chelates of hydroxy 1 -proline exhibit a 2 ̆ 2 yield value 2 ̆ 2 (or critical concentration requirement) before any inhibition occurs, and (g) the equilibrium pH of the experiments affects both the extent and nature of the inhibition...|$|E
40|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} {{released}} in the atmosphere {{is responsible for the}} so-called greenhouse effect, leading to global warming. According to the Kyoto protocol the emission of greenhouse and acid gases, resulting from fossil fuels combustion, or present as constituents of natural gas, must be reduced. Different national and international research projects have emerged and the present work is a thermodynamic study carried out in the frame work of the ANR CapCO 2 (French National Research Agency) on the capture of CO 2 in post-combustion processes. Our objective is to obtain reliable thermodynamic data for different amines in order to correlate CO 2 capture properties and the amine structure. More specifically enthalpies of solution and gas solubilities in aqueous solutions of selected amines are determined simultaneously to solution density and amine dissociation constants. This work is the continuation and the extension of a study concerning more classical alkanolamines in aqueous solutions [1]. The enthalpies of solution are directly measured by flow calorimetric technique at temperatures 323 K and 373 K and pressures up to 2 MPa. The gas solubilities in the amine solutions are deduced from the analysis of the enthalpic data. A customized flow mixing unit adapted to a SETARAM C- 80 calorimeter [2] is used to measure the enthalpy of solution of CO 2 in aqueous solutions of amine. Experiments are carried out at constant temperature and pressure for different gas loadings up to the saturation of the solvent. The dissociation constants are determined at atmospheric pressure and temperatures between 298 K and 333 K using an <b>automatic</b> <b>titrator</b> from Mettler-Toledo equipped with a glass electrode.
