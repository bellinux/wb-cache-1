50|$|Pharyngeal flap surgery {{may be able}} {{to improve}} speech {{performance}} in children or adults with a cleft palate who have velopharyngeal insufficiency. In fact, there is a high success rate for improvement of speech following pharyngeal flap surgery. However, surgery does not guarantee perfect or 100% intelligible speech. In addition to speech improvements, pharyngeal flap surgery may help eliminate hypernasality, nasal turbulence, and facial grimacing (Tonz et al., 2002).Often, speech improvements are not obvious immediately following the surgery. Speech improvements are more prevalent after one year post surgery and usually continue for several years. The outcomes of pharyngeal flap surgery vary among each individual in regards to improvements in hyponasality, hypernasality, nasal turbulence, voice quality, <b>articulation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility</b> (Tonz et al., 2002; Liedman-Boshki et al., 2005).|$|E
40|$|Dysarthria is a motor {{disorder}} of speech characterized by abnormalities of the <b>articulation</b> <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility</b> of speech. Phonation {{and the rate}} of facial movements may also be affected. Understanding the nature and course of dysarthria in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is important because loss of communication prevents patients from participating in many activities, may lead to social isolation, and reduces the quality of life. The goal of management of dysarthria in ALS patients is to optimize communication effectiveness for as long as possible. The information about dysarthria in ALS is dispersed in physiological, pathological, speech therapy, otorhinolaringo-logical and neurological publications. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on the clinical features, differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, investigations and management of dysarthria in ALS patients. There is a need to compare the different methods used to assess dysarthria and for controlled clinical trials to assess therapeutic strategies. Key words: ALS, MND, dysarthria, bulbar pals...|$|E

This version is reproduced with permission from Annals Publishing Company. [URL] paper describes the assessment and training program to evaluate speech, language, and communication skills of profoundly deaf children during and after training. Two sensory aids/prostheses are used: hearing aids and the Nucleus multichannel cochlear implant. Using a single-subject time-series experimental design, children's speech, language, and communication skills are assessed. For speech skills, assessment includes formal tests of <b>articulation</b> <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility,</b> syllable stress and process analyses, analyses of suprasegmental features, and voice quality. For general communication abilities, conversational skills with different speakers, story production skills, comprehension and expression of procedural information, discourse skills, and a measure of conversational interaction skills (pragmatics) are analyzed at regular intervals. Regular observations also sample the subjects' mode and frequency of interactions with individuals and groups in the school and home setting. Normative tests and formal analyses of language samples are also used to assess the overall language age of the child, vocabulary size, and kinds of expressive and receptive, syntactic, and semantic ability.

The study involved 26 individuals with non-progressive dysarthria who were randomly allocated to receive either LSVT (R) or traditional dysarthria therapy (TRAD), both of which were administered for 16 hourly sessions over 4 weeks. Participants 2 ̆ 7 speech samples were collected over a total of six testing sessions during three assessment phases: (1) prior to treatment, (2) immediately post-treatment, and (3) 6 months post-treatment (FU).

40|$|Speech {{impairment}} often {{occurs in}} patients after treatment for {{head and neck}} cancer. A specific speech characteristic that influences intelligibility and speech quality is voice-onset-time (VOT) in stop consonants. VOT {{is one of the}} functionally most relevant parameters that distinguishes voiced and voiceless stops. The goal of the present study is to investigate the role and validity of acoustic-phonetic and artificial neural network analysis (ANN) of stop consonants in a multidimensional speech assessment protocol. Speech recordings of 51 patients 6 months after treatment for oral or oropharyngeal cancer and of 18 control speakers were evaluated by trained speech pathologists regarding intelligibility and articulation. Acoustic-phonetic analyses and artificial neural network analysis of the phonological feature voicing were performed in voiced /b/, /d/ and voiceless /p/ and /t/. Results revealed that objective acoustic-phonetic analysis and feature analysis for /b, d, p/ distinguish between patients and controls. Within patients, /t, d/ distinguish for tumour location and tumour stage. Measurements of the phonological feature voicing in almost all consonants were significantly correlated with <b>articulation</b> <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility,</b> but not with self-evaluations. Overall, objective acoustic-phonetic and feature analyses of stop consonants are feasible and contribute to further development of a multidimensional speech quality assessment protocol.

40|$|Background: The {{discussion}} {{about the timing of}} palate closure {{has been going on for}} over 90 years. An early closure is favorable for speech development, but can interfere with maxillary growth. However, beneficial results on both after a one-stage palate closure were presented in several publications. Accompanied by the benefits of not having to undergo two separate surgeries, these results led worldwide to the decision in most cleft centers, including the UMCG, to prefer a one-stage palate closure. The aim of the present study is to compare surgical impact and speech outcome at 2. 5 years of age between a one- and early two-stage palate closure. Methods: Patients underwent either a one-stage palate closure after 2007 at the age of 10. 8 months (group 1) or a two-stage closure before 2007 at the age of 10. 4 and 18. 0 months, respectively (group 2). Surgical impact was compared by looking at the duration of surgery, the length of hospital stay and the number of post-operative complications. Speech outcome was assessed at the age of 2. 5 years by looking at resonance problems, nasal air emission, <b>articulation</b> <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility.</b> Results: The one-stage closure group showed significantly shorter duration of surgery and hospital stay (p < 0. 001 and p = 0. 001, resp.). A better speech outcome was found after one-stage closure for all speech variables, but only articulation was significantly better (p = 0. 029). Conclusion: Our study indicated that the one-stage palate closure is preferable over the two-stage palate closure with regard to surgical impact and speech development. However, maxillary growth is not taken into account. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In {{the ongoing}} {{discussion}} about timing of palate closure, {{it is said}} that early closure is favorable for speech development, but can interfere with maxillary growth. On the other hand, beneficial results on both after one-stage palate closure have also been presented. The assumption that one-stage palate closure leads to less surgical impact on the child probably contributed to the choice for this procedure in most cleft centers. However, no previous research has verified this assumption. The aim of the present study is to compare surgical impact and speech outcome at 2. 5 years of age between children who underwent either one- or early two-stage palate closure. Methods: Patients underwent either one-stage palate closure between 2007 and 2010 at a median age of 10. 8 months (group 1, n = 24) or early two-stage. closure before 2007 at median ages of 10. 4 and 18. 2 months, respectively (group 2, n = 24). Surgical impact was compared between the two groups by means of duration of surgery, length of hospital stay and number of post-operative complications. Speech outcome was compared by means of resonance problems, nasal air emission, <b>articulation</b> <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility,</b> all assessed at a median age of 2. 5 years. Results: The one-stage closure group showed significantly shorter duration of surgery and length of hospital stay (p < 0. 001 and p = 0. 001, respectively) and significantly better articulation (p = 0. 029) than the early two-stage closure group. Conclusion: One-stage palate closure is preferable over early two-stage palate closure with regard to surgical impact and speech development. More extensive, prospective studies, in which maxillary growth is taken into account, should be conducted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Objective: The aim was to assess <b>articulation</b> <b>and</b> speech <b>intelligibility</b> over time in a group of cochlear implant users implanted at 8 yr or over. The hypothesis was that the postoperative speech production performance would be greater than the preoperative performance. Design: A test of <b>intelligibility</b> using sentences <b>and</b> an <b>articulation</b> test measuring non-imitative elicited speech were administered to 11 and 10 subjects, respectively, who were implanted with the 22 -electrode cochlear implant. Nine subjects received both tests. Age at implantation ranged from 8 yr to 20 yr and implant use ranged from 1 yr to 4 yr 5 mo. Results: For both the <b>intelligibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>articulation</b> tests roughly half of the subjects showed significant improvements over time and group mean postoperative performance significantly exceeded preoperative performance. Improvements occurred for front, middle, and back consonants; for stops, fricatives, and glides and for voiceless and voiced consonants.

40|$|Objectives: {{to develop}} an {{evidence-based}} therapy program aimed at improving tracheoesophageal speech intelligibility. The therapy program is based on particular problems found for TE speakers in a previous study as performed by the authors. Patients/Materials and Methods: 9 male laryngectomized individuals {{were included in the}} study. Seven had had a total laryngectomy, one had had a PM flap and one a gastric pull-up. Mean age was 64; 9 years and mean time after TLE was 5; 6 years. A therapy program was developed based on the most common difficulties of TE speakers found in literature and on a previous perception experiment of the authors. Where possible, therapy techniques were based on evidence-based research. TE speakers participated in a nine-session therapy program spread over five weeks. Several pre and post tests were used to measure the effect of the therapy program: the speakers were asked to read out speech material, {{both before and after the}} therapy program, including almost all levels of speech: phoneme level, word level, sentence level and spontaneous speech. Different types of raters were used for each of the different tests. Naïve, inexperienced listeners rated spontaneous speech in a semantic scaling experiment; naïve, but experienced raters (phoneticians) rated phoneme and sentence level; experienced listeners, well known with TE speech, rated phoneme level. Questionnaires were filled out by the speakers themselves and a close relative. A Voice Handicap Index was also used, but will not be discussed here. Results: Scores improved for fricatives in initial position, and for the voiced-voiceless distinction. For medial position, all manners of articulation, except the approximant /l/ improved, as well as the voiced-voiceless distinction. Sentence intelligibility also improved. The questionnaires show that speakers are more positive about their own speech post therapy. The scores for the semantic scaling experiment did not improve. However, the semantic scale results on <b>articulation</b> <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility</b> did improve. Conclusions: Although already effective in its present set-up, some extension of this 5 -week rehabilitation program is necessary to ensure an optimal progression from phoneme level to spontaneous speech level...|$|E

40|$|A new {{software}} for modeling pathological speech signals {{is presented in}} this paper. The software is called NeuroSpeech. This software enables the analysis of pathological speech signals considering different speech dimensions: phonation, <b>articulation,</b> prosody, <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility.</b> All the methods considered in the software have been validated in previous experiments and publications. The current version of NeuroSpeech was developed to model dysarthric speech signals from people with Parkinson's disease; however, {{the structure of the}} software allows other computer scientists or developers to include other pathologies and/or other measures in order to complement the existing options. Three different tasks can be performed with the current version of the software: (1) the modeling of the speech recordings considering the aforementioned speech dimensions, (2) the automatic discrimination of Parkinson's vs. non-Parkinson's speech signals (if the user has access to recordings of other pathologies, he/she can re-train the system to perform the detection of other diseases), and (3) the prediction of the neurological state of the patient according to the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score. The prediction of the dysarthria level according to the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment scale is also provided (the user can also train the system to perform the prediction of other kind of scales or degrees of severity). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first software with the characteristics described above, and we consider that it will help other researchers to contribute to the state-of-the-art in pathological speech assessment from different perspectives, e. g., from the clinical point of view for interpretation, and from the computer science point of view enabling the test of different measures and pattern recognition techniques...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} the speech characteristics in an English-speaking Ugandan boy of 4. 5 years who has a rare paramedian craniofacial cleft (unilateral lip, alveolar, palatal, nasal and maxillary cleft, and associated hypertelorism). Closure of the lip together with the closure of the hard and soft palate (one-stage palatal closure) was performed at the age of 5 months. Objective as well as subjective speech assessment techniques were used. The speech samples were perceptually judged for <b>articulation,</b> <b>intelligibility</b> <b>and</b> nasality. The Nasometer was used for the objective measurement of the nasalance values. The most striking communication problems in this child with the rare craniofacial cleft are an incomplete phonetic inventory, a severely impaired speech intelligibility with the presence of very severe hypernasality, mild nasal emission, phonetic disorders (omission of several consonants, decreased intraoral pressure in explosives, insufficient frication of fricatives and the use of a middorsum palatal stop) and phonological disorders (deletion of initial and final consonants and consonant clusters). The increased objective nasalance values are in agreement with the presence of the audible nasality disorders. The results revealed that several phonetic <b>and</b> phonological <b>articulation</b> disorders together with a decreased speech <b>intelligibility</b> <b>and</b> resonance disorders are present in the child with a rare craniofacial cleft. To what extent a secondary surgery for velopharyngeal insufficiency, combined with speech therapy, will improve speech <b>intelligibility,</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>and</b> resonance characteristics is a subject for further research. The results of such analyses may ultimately serve as a starting point for specific surgical and logopedic treatment that addresses the specific needs of children with rare facial clefts...|$|R
40|$|Speech, {{language}} and communication {{are very important}} areas of child's development. Anyone can easily notice that a child is experiencing difficulties with speech, {{language and}} communication. To this end, such issues should be identified while still developing and not yet producing (long-term) consequences. They should be addressed in time through encouragement and activities. Speech and language therapists often encounter difficulties, such as the lack of tools for prevention and diagnostics enabling fast, reliable and systematic examination of speech, language and communication. For {{the purpose of the}} thesis we combined four instruments to check speech, language and communication abilities in children aged three. Our research sample included 41 three-year-olds, 20 boys and 21 girls, who attended the periodic health examination in the Health Centre Krško. <b>Articulation</b> <b>and</b> phonological development were tested using the Evaluation of speech articulation, storytelling through the Storytelling assessment of the story Rokavička, socio-pragmatic skills with the Socio-pragmatic skill rating scale, <b>and</b> speech <b>intelligibility</b> with the Intelligibility in context scale: Slovenian. Moreover, we also looked into statistical significance of gender, attendance of an educational institution and sucking habits with regard to the development of speech and language in three-year-olds. In the empirical part of the thesis we calculated average values of individual tests to gain insight into the development of speech, language and communication in children aged three. The children narrated the story slightly below the expected average. The socio-pragmatic skills (assertiveness and responsiveness) matched the children's age. Among the most common articulation errors were sibilant distortions and subsitutions of the sound /r/ (consonant and vowel clusters) with one of the liquids. As for phonological processes, gliding, cluster reduction or simplification, fronting and deafrication were frequently used. Having calculated the average values, we compared them according to gender, attendance of an educational institution and sucking habits and examined the statistical significance of the differences. Results suggest that gender was the decisive element in storytelling as girls performed statistically better than boys. It also had a slight influence on phonological development. As far as <b>articulation,</b> socio-pragmatic skills <b>and</b> speech <b>intelligibility</b> are concerned, gender did not play an important role. In turn, attending an educational institution proved to make a strong impact on the phonological development in children (usage of phonological processes). Moreover, it also had an influence on <b>articulation,</b> speech <b>intelligibility</b> <b>and</b> the socio-pragmatic skill – responsiveness (no influence on assertiveness). Attending an educational institution did not affect the storytelling performance. Sucking habits affected both phonological development <b>and</b> <b>articulation</b> in children.

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{addresses}} {{the development of}} the I-RAVN Test of Speech Intelligibility, an assessment instrument designed to identify which speech components most affect speech intelligibility. The I-RAVN consists of ratings of overall <b>intelligibility,</b> <b>and</b> ratings of four speech components: rate/rhythm/prosody, articulation, voice quality/breath support, and nasality using a rating scale technique adapted from the CAPE-V instrument for voice. This study seeks to establish that listeners can reliably rate overall <b>intelligibility</b> <b>and</b> the four speech components in speakers with dysarthria. METHODS: Twenty-two graduate students listened to recordings from 24 talkers (7 normal, 6 with Parkinson Disease, 11 with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy) producing 3 sentences. The listeners rated each talker using the I-RAVN tool, which uses a visual analog scale (100 mm lines) to evaluate the following speech dimensions: overall impression of intelligibility; rate/rhythm/prosody; articulatory precision; voice quality/breath support; and nasality. RESULTS: To assess intra-rater reliability and agreement, listeners rated sentences from five of the speakers chosen at random a second time, and Pearson product-moment correlations, t-tests, and percent close agreement calculations were performed for all pairs of 22 listeners. Pearson t-tests showed that {{there were no significant differences}} between the first and second ratings of the repeated talkers, though percent close agreement calculations demonstrated that nasality, <b>intelligibility,</b> <b>and</b> <b>articulation</b> were more likely to be rated consistently than rate and voice. Overall, intra-rater reliability was high for <b>intelligibility,</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>and</b> voice, and lower for rate and nasality. To assess inter-rater reliability and agreement, Pearson product-moment correlations, factor analysis, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), rater bias one way analyses of variance (ANOVAs), and percent close agreement calculations were performed. The Pearson correlations demonstrated that more than 85 % of the ratings were consistent for <b>intelligibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>articulation,</b> <b>and</b> less than 50 % for rate. The ICCs showed that listeners had high consistency when rating intelligibility, moderate consistency when rating <b>articulation,</b> voice, <b>and</b> nasality, and lower consistency when rating rate. Inter-rater reliability and agreement across measures were high for intelligibility, somewhat lower for <b>articulation,</b> voice, <b>and</b> nasality, and consistently lower for rate. Overall, good reliability and agreement were noted for <b>intelligibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>articulation,</b> with moderate values for voice quality and nasality. Lower levels of reliability and agreement were obtained for the rate/rhythm/prosody scale on both intra- and inter-rater tests. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results indicate adequate inter- and intra-rater reliability and agreement for the I-RAVN Test of Speech Intelligibility for dysarthric speech. Further research will determine if the I-RAVN can be used as an explanatory, streamlined assessment technique to determine treatment targets for individuals with speech intelligibility deficits.

Speech prosody <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility</b> are two of the most affected areas in hypokinetic dysarthria. However, assessment of these areas could potentially be problematic as speech prosody <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility</b> could be affected by the type of speech materials employed. Objective: To comparatively explore the effects of different types of speech stimulus on speech prosody <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility</b> in PD speakers. Methods: Speech prosody <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility</b> of two groups of individuals with varying degree of dysarthria resulting from PD was compared to that of a group of control speakers using sentence reading, passage reading and monologue. Acoustic analysis including measures on fundamental frequency (F 0), intensity and speech rate was used to form a prosodic profile for each individual. Speech intelligibility was measured for the speakers with dysarthria using direct magnitude estimation. Results: Difference in F 0 variability between the speakers with dysarthria and control speakers was only observed in sentence reading task. Difference in the average intensity level was observed for speakers with mild dysarthria to that of the control speakers. Additionally, there were stimulus effect on both <b>intelligibility</b> <b>and</b> prosodic profile. Conclusions: The prosodic profile of PD speakers was different from that of the control speakers in the more structured task, <b>and</b> lower <b>intelligibility</b> was found in less structured task.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the accentedness, comprehensibility <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility</b> of Second Language (L 2) speech, and is based on the replication of an empirical study carried out in the 1990 s by Munro and Derwing (1995 a). Following the methodology of the original study, ratings were collected from native English listeners for the accentedness, comprehensibility, <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility</b> of spontaneous L 2 English utterances of mother tongue Arabic speakers. These ratings were then correlated with each other to ascertain what bearing a foreign accent has on the comprehensibility <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility</b> of speech. The three listener ratings were also correlated to error counts for phonetic and phonemic errors, and non-native intonation, in an attempt to establish which error types affect an utterance most in terms of its accentedness, comprehensibility <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility.</b> The original study resulted in two major findings: firstly, accentedness <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility</b> were found to be orthogonal; and secondly, non-native intonation was found to be more highly correlated with problems of comprehensibility than were phonetic and phonemic errors. These two findings were re-examined {{in the context of the}} present study. The results suggest that if language is treated as a complex system, whose behaviour is based on the interaction of all of its parts, as Dynamic Systems Theory (De Bot, 2008) proposes, then i) accentedness does in fact affect the intelligibility of L 2 speech, and ii) both segmental and suprasegmental issues contribute to problems of comprehensibility. The main finding of this study is that whether speech is comprehensible and intelligible is based on the outcome of the interactions of its parts. It concludes that to examine individual linguistic aspects of an utterance as isolated phenomena is ineffective...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{modulation}} spectral {{representation is}} investigated for non-intrusive quality <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility</b> measurement of rever-berant and dereverberated speech. The representation is obtained {{by means of}} an auditory-inspired filterbank analysis of critical-band temporal envelopes of the speech signal. Modulation spectral insights are used to develop an adaptive measure termed speech to reverberation modulation energy ratio. Experimental results show the proposed measure outperforming three standard algorithms for tasks involving estimation of multiple dimensions of perceived coloration, as well as quality measurement <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility</b> esti-mation of reverberant and dereverberated speech. Index Terms—Coloration, dereverberation, modulation spec-trum, quality diagnosis, reverberation. I...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study is to investigate and compare the speed <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility</b> of speech in hearing impaired and normal hearing Persian speaking elementary school boys and girls. 33 hearing impaired students are randomly selected from three hearing impaired groups (profound, severe and moderately-severe) and compared with 60 normal hearing students. The speed of speech was measured according to reading Words Per Minute (WPM), <b>and</b> speech <b>intelligibility</b> was tested by a 5 -rank scale method. As expected, the normal hearing had more speed <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility</b> of speech in contrast to the hearing impaired group. Also hearing impaired boys had a better speed <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility</b> of speech compared to hearing impaired girls but in normal hearing group, girls had better speed. The amount of P-value for moderately-severe and sever hearing impaired was 0. 006 and this amount for profound and moderately-severe hearing impaired was 0. 002, so p-value is < 0. 05 and significantly important. Profound hearing impaired group read the text more slowly and had lower speech intelligibility than other two hearing impaired groups...|$|R

Speech modi- fications are made by resynthesising speech that has been spec- trally smoothed. Objective measures are applied to the mod- ified speech and include measures of speech quality, signal- to-noise ratio <b>and</b> <b>intelligibility,</b> as well as proposing the nor- malised frequency-weighted spectral distortion (NFD) measure. The measures are compared to subjective intelligibility scores where {{it is found that}} several have high correlation (|r| ≥ 0. 7), with NFD achieving the highest correlation (r = − 0. 81...|$|R
