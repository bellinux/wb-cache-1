In a lab experiment, we reduced the body condition of either the female or the male of a pair to test whether energy reserves affect the timing of the shift, and whether female signalling behaviour depends on energetic state. Males with a lowered condition took the young later and incubated for a shorter period, which prolonged the incubation time of their female partners. When female condition was lowered, female and male incubation durations remained unchanged, although females signalled their readiness to shift more intensely.

A majority of NETs abundantly express somatostatin receptors. Consequently, following administration of somatostatin (SST) analogs labeled with γ-emitting radionuclides, these tumors can be imaged for diagnosis, staging or follow-up purposes. Furthermore, when β-emitting radionuclides are used, radiolabeled peptides (radiopeptides) can also be used for the treatment for NET patients. Even though excellent results have been achieved with PRRT, complete responses are still rare, which means that there is room for improvement. In this review, we highlight some of the directions currently under investigation in pilot clinical studies or in preclinical development to achieve this goal. Although randomized clinical trials are still lacking, early studies have shown that tumor response might be improved by application of other radionuclides, such as α-emitters or radionuclide combinations, or by <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> radiopeptide administration routes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pathological {{gambling}} (PG) is {{an impulse}} control disorder characterized by excessive monetary risk seeking {{in the face}} of negative consequences. We used tools from the field of behavioral economics to refine our description of risk-taking behavior in pathological gamblers. This theoretical framework allowed us to confront two hypotheses: (1) pathological gamblers distort winning probabilities more than controls; and (2) pathological gamblers merely overweight the whole probability range. Method Eighteen pathological gamblers and 20 matched healthy participants performed a decision-making task involving choices between safe <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> money and risky gambles. The online <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> safe <b>amounts,</b> depending on participants' decisions, allowed us to compute 'certainty equivalents' reflecting the subjective probability weight associated with each gamble. The behavioral data were then fitted with a mathematical function known as the 'probability weighting function', allowing us to disentangle our two hypotheses. RESULTS: The results favored the second hypothesis, suggesting that pathological gamblers' behavior reflects economic preferences globally shifted towards risk, rather than excessively distorted probability weighting. A mathematical parameter (elevation parameter) estimated by our fitting procedure was found to correlate with gambling severity among pathological gamblers, and with gambling affinity among controls. CONCLUSIONS: PG is associated with a specific pattern of economic preferences, characterized by a global (i. e. probability independent) shift towards risky options. The observed correlation with gambling severity suggests that the present 'certainty equivalent' task may be relevant for clinical use...|$|R

Water absorption (WA) capacity has two purposes: (a) measuring the interconnected porosity, which is useful for mechanical concrete analysis and durability issues, and (b) allowing <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> water used in concrete production. Our analysis shows that vacuum during soaking is recommended for the RAs' interconnected porosity determination.

The saturated surface dry (SSD) state determination can also be fastened using centrifuge, air flow drum, laser scattering, and microwave drying evaporometry, without significant differences. The use of these techniques is still restricted due to such factors as commercial availability, geometric limitations of the sample containers, and difficulty in controlling the temperature and the relative humidity. For concrete production, WA kinetics during the first 30 min is fundamental. Accuracy of the results is arguable regarding the practical issues, for example, vibration or trapped air bubble. Mathematical artefacts can overcome those problems but need to be calibrated with experimental data determined by standard tests over time.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to improve the {{mechanical}} properties of polymer infiltrated ceramics (PICs) by the enhancement of the adhesion between both components.

40|$|It is now {{possible}} to partially deflect gravitation away from an object so that the gravitational attraction on the object is reduced. That effect {{makes it possible to}} extract energy from the gravitational field, which makes the generation of gravito-electric power technologically feasible. Such plants would be similar to hydro-electric plants and would have their advantages of not needing fuel and not polluting the environment. Physically, the action of deflecting away gravitational attraction, which of course is directed toward the gravitation source, produces an equal but opposite reaction on the mechanism that produces the deflection of the gravitational action [the deflector], a reaction directed away from the gravitation source. The result is the combination of reducing the gravitational attractive acceleration of the object toward the gravitation source plus the introducing of a reactive acceleration on the object in the direction away from the gravitation source. Such a deflector, engineered to enable controlled <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>amount</b> and the direction of its action, could provide for a spacecraft both launch levitation and deep space travel acceleration.

The influence of the particle size distribution of ultrafine white cement and the usage of water reducer on the standard thickness and early age strength of white cement paste was investigated. The {{results indicated that the}} ultrafine white cement with d 50 = 4. 62 µm and d 90 = 10. 48 µm can be obtained when the crushing pressure was 0. 7 MPa and the feeding pressure was 0. 4 MPa. The standard thickness of white cement paste decreased from 30. 5 % of the raw material to 26. 0 % of the ultrafine white cement (d 50 = 4. 42 µm, d 90 = 10. 26 µm). The use of 2 % naphthalene-based water reducer can reduce 15. 4 % water consumption. The 3 d compressive strength of pure ultrafine white cement sample reached 174 % of that of raw white cement. The 28 d compressive strength of ultrafine white cement with 3 % naphthalene-based water reducer added was 22. 9 % of that of pure ultrafine white cement. A large number of needle-shape nanometer ettringite (AFT) was generated in the early stage of hydratration and layered C-H-S was formed with the decreasing <b>of</b> the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> AFT in the later stage of hydratration. It’s supposed that the formation of the large number of needle-shape nanometer AFT was related to the reducing of the particle size of C 3 A during the ultrafine grinding and the no <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> the added gypsum, which resulted in the faster hydration of C 3 A...|$|R
40|$|Polymeric nanocomposites are {{intimate}} {{combinations of}} a polymer with inorganic nanoparticles. Such nanomaterials have attracted significant attention {{over the years}} because of their potential uses as chemical sensors, electronic and optical devices, and as catalysts. For catalytic applications, in particular, small and well dispersed nanoparticles are desired. We report here the synthesis of gold-polyaniline (AuPANI) nanocomposites and their catalytic performance. The simple synthetic route involved pre-organizing the gold ions in polyaniline (PANI) through complexation followed {{by the addition of}} a reducing agent. Control over the degree of reduction of tetrachloroaurate ions (AuCl 4 –) depends on the electrochemical potential of the system which in turn depends on the molar ratio of the nitrogen atoms on PANI to AuCl 4 –. Gold nanoparticles formed when the AuPANI complexes were reduced with sodium borohydride {{and the size of the}} nanoparticles could be varied with <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> sodium borohydride used. Low <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> sodium borohydride induced slow nucleation rate and were associated with relatively large metallic particles. The smallest gold nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution were obtained when a ratio of sodium borohydride:gold of about 6 : 1 was used. Simple electrolytes like NaCl and NaOH did not induce the aggregation of Au nanoparticles as predicted by the DLVO theory. However, chain-like aggregates formed when aggregation was induced by the reduction of PANI while close-packed aggregates formed when PANI was oxidized or protonated. The Au nanoparticles were found to be more stable when dispersed on ring-substibuted PANI than on unsubstituted PANI. The catalytic performance of AuPANI was evaluated using the reduction of 4 -nitrophenol by sodium borohydride. The reaction was observed to follow the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics...|$|R
40|$|New {{protocols}} for {{the extraction}} of nucleic acids from soil doi: 10. 1111 /j. 1365 - 2672. 2009. 04536. x Sir, The publication by Wang et al. (2009), presenting ‘An improved method to extract RNA from soil with efficient removal of humic acids’, is of great interest. The applica-tion of the improved protocol proposed there resulted in the recovery of highly pure RNA from soil samples and increased the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> extracted RNA tenfold compared to the original method. Therefore, the study may certainly be considered another step towards reproducible results in molecular biological soil analysis. However, an <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> applied Al 2 (SO 4) 3, as recommended by Peršoh et al. (2008) to quantitatively remove the humic substances from the analysed soil samples prior to cell lysis, was renounced. The proposed method may therefore be indeed more time-efficient, but may only provide comparable results in an experimental design, in which parallel sub-samples of {{one and the same}} soil sample are processed. It has to be considered that all types of nucleic acid extraction protocols, which are based on the separation of humic substances from nucleic acids subsequent to cell disrup-tion, share a common shortcoming. As demonstrated by Crecchio and Stotzky (1998), nucleic acids in aqueous solution irreversibly bind to humic acids. This results in a substantial loss of nucleic acids during such a posterior purification step. Furthermore, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> loss corre-lates with the quantity and depends on the, rarely known, quality of the humic substances in a given soil sample. Therefore, an entire removal of humic substances from soil samples prior to cell disruption is highly recom-mended for any kind of quantitative molecular biological studies, in which different soil types or horizons are com-paratively analysed for their nucleic acid content and composition...|$|R
