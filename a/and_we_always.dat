On 19 February 1978 {{they were joined}} at The Rocket {{for the first time}} by a support band from Horley called Lockjaw, featuring bassist Simon Gallup. Hansa was dissatisfied with the group's demos and did not wish to release [...] "Killing an Arab". [...] The label suggested that the band attempt [...] cover versions instead. [...] They refused, and by March 1978 Easy Cure's contract with the label had been dissolved. Smith later recalled, [...] "We were very young. They just thought they could turn us into a teen group. They actually wanted us to do cover versions <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> refused." ...|$|E

[...] Carey included her duet with Busta Rhymes, [...] "I Know What You Want", which was released as a single from his album, It Ain't Safe No More (2002), and became Carey's highest charting song internationally since 2001, reaching top five peaks in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, the US and the UK. In an interview with Carson Daly, Carey said, [...] "The Busta Rhymes duet...has become so successful <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> said I would put it on my album as well." [...] The re-release also included [...] "There Goes My Heart", [...] "Got a Thing 4 You" [...] featuring Da Brat and Elephant Man, and [...] "The One (So So Def Remix)" [...] featuring Bone Crusher. The re-released version of the album charted for three weeks on the Oricon album chart in Japan, where it peaked at number 96 on the issue dated July 14, 2003.|$|E

500|$|For the Borg battle, Knoll {{insisted on}} closeup shots that were near the alien vessel, necessitating a {{physical}} model. ILM layered their [...] model {{with an additional}} fiveinches of etched brass over a glowing neon lightbox for internal illumination. To make the Borg vessel appear even larger than it was, Knoll made sure that an edge of it was facing the camera like the prow of a ship and that the Cube broke {{the edges of the}} frame. To give the Cube greater depth and texture, Rosenberg shot the vessel with harsher light. [...] "I created this really odd, raking three-quarter backlight coming from the right or left side, which I balanced out with nets and a couple of little lights. I wanted it to look scary and mysterious, so it was lit like a point, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> had the camera dutched to it; we never just had it coming straight at us," [...] he said. Small lights attached to the Cube's surface helped to create visual interest and convey scale; the model was deliberately shot with a slow, determined pacing to contrast with the Federation ships engaged in battle with the Borg. The impact of Federation weaponry on the Borg Cube was simulated using a [...] model of the Cube. The model had specific areas which could be blown up multiple times without damaging the miniature. For the final explosion of the Cube, Rosenberg shot ten [...] Cube miniatures with explosive-packed lightweight skins. The Cubes were suspended from pipes sixtyfeet above the camera on the ground. Safety glass was placed over the lens to prevent damage, while the camera was covered with plywood to protect it from bits of plastic that rained down after each explosion. The smaller Borg sphere was a [...] model that was shot separately from the Cube and digitally added in post-production. The time-travel vortex the Sphere creates was simulated with a rocket re-entry effect; bowshock forms in front of the ship, then streams backwards at high speed. Interactive lighting was played across the computer-generated Enterprise model for when the ship is caught in the time vortex.|$|E

[...] Commenting on the artwork, Brandon stated, [...] "We take a lot of pride in all the art we use. Every record has a certain vibe, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> want the artwork to represent that same energy. This record has a very specific, very dark feel throughout and I know that of any record we've ever released, this is definitely the best artwork we've ever had."

2500|$|During Nancy's childhood, {{her family}} moved to a house called Rheola in Croxley Green. After she left school, Nancy {{completed}} a course at the Triangle Secretarial College in London and obtained a position as a clerk in the Imperial Continental Gas Association. Soon after she started there, her friend from the College, Madge Fox, joined her. In 1925, Madge married Frank Henry James, and the couple lived in Hurtmore Cottage near Godalming. It was here that Christie saw Nancy at house parties on weekends before his divorce from Agatha. After their marriage, in 1928, Archie and Nancy Christie lived in a London flat at 84 Avenue Road (NW8). They had one son, Archibald (born 1930). Christie stayed in contact with Rosalind, his daughter from his first marriage. In an interview that was published in The Times, Rosalind Hicks made the following comments about her father's second marriage: [...] "Eventually my father married Nancy Neele and they lived happily together until she died. I saw him quite often <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> liked and understood one another." ...|$|E
2500|$|I had {{a terrific}} {{friendship}} with Sheila Florance. In fact she acted in {{my very first}} film, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> used to joke that I would make her a star. When I heard suddenly that she was dying of cancer I visited her immediately. There was no sentimentality or anything on her part—she was an incredible woman—but she said jokingly, 'There is still time to turn me into a star, but let's be quick.' I went home and spent three days and three nights writing the script and then with Barry Dickins and Sheila we did another draft. She was given eight weeks to live and so we made A Woman's Tale with this hanging over us. This motivated us, of course, but Sheila had a degree of greatness about her. She was a very powerful woman. It was an amazing challenge {{to make a film}} about life, in the face of death. To get the money of course was impossible and I had to pawn everything I had. People have asked me how we did it but to some extent we were idiotically courageous in taking this risk. Sheila and I joked all the time. I would say to Sheila, [...] "Please don't die on me or you'll kill me". She would reply, [...] "Don't worry I'll be a good girl." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2009, Tricky Stewart {{revealed}} that Ciara {{had been working}} on her fourth studio album. At the time the project was set to be produced solely by trio of Tricky Stewart, The-Dream and Ciara herself. Stewart described the studio sessions as [...] "feeling good" [...] with the music [...] "having a good vibe". On the record's theme he said [...] " [...] is obviously is gonna have tempo to it, but I think it's gonna have even more substance than the last record. She dances <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>always</b> want to bring out what she does that other people don't." [...] Additionally the trio said that they intended the album to contain no features except for one collaboration with The-Dream, although there would features on remixes. They had wanted to release the album in 2009 but accepted that a 2010 release was more realistic. Later in an interview with Rap-Up magazine, two songs were name dropped, [...] "Speechless" [...] which was the aforementioned feature with The-Dream and [...] "Gifted." [...] Both songs where tipped to appear on the album, though on the final track listing only [...] "Speechless" [...] made the album without The-Dream's vocals. In December 2009, Digital Spy reported that Ciara had begun working Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins, someone she had previously collaborated with for Fantasy Ride (2009). Milk Recording Studios, in Atlanta, confirmed that Ciara had been recording at their studios with Miles Walker, an engineer who worked on Usher's Raymond v. Raymond and Mary J. Blige's Stronger with Each Tear. He mixed tracks for the album, however none of the tracks he mixed for the record made the final track listing.|$|E
