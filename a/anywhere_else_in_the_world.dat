5|$|The park {{is among}} the most biologically diverse of Turkey's {{national}} parks. It is the native and migratory habitat of hundreds of species of birds, mammals, plants, and marine life, some of which are entirely endemic to the park and cannot be observed <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> For these reasons, it is protected by numerous wildlife and wetland conventions, and is of great national and international importance in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{more typical}} {{locations}} across the Mojave Desert, {{many of the}} water-dependent Death Valley habitats possess a diversity {{of plant and animal}} species that are not found <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> The existence of these species is due largely to a unique geologic history and the process of evolution that has progressed in habitats that have been isolated from one another since the Pleistocene epoch.|$|E

5|$|To {{prevent any}} similar {{incidents}} from reoccurring, Nintendo quickly ordered the episode pulled, {{and it has}} not aired since, not even outside Japan. Maddie Blaustein, the English dub voice of Meowth, said twice on the Serebii.net forums that this episode was dubbed in the United States by 4Kids Entertainment. On the other hand, Veronica Taylor, the English voice of Ash, claimed that this episode was never dubbed and will not be dubbed, though this was contradicted again on September 25, 2016, when Eric Stuart, the English dub voice of Brock and James, said that 4Kids did indeed dub the episode. Regardless, any plans to release this episode outside Japan were abandoned after Nintendo objected, and it was never broadcast <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Coincidentally, the episode aired around the same time Pokémon was being adapted for American audiences. 4Kids Entertainment's dub took extra precaution in bright and flashing lights in the show, using the post-1997 versions altering lighting and the frequency of flashing lights for earlier episodes of their American release.|$|E

25|$|Most of the German {{universities}} are public institutions, charging fees of only around €60-200 per semester for each student, usually to cover expenses {{associated with the}} university cafeterias and (usually mandatory) public transport tickets.

The dual education system combines both practical and theoretical education but {{does not lead to}} academic degrees. It is more popular in Germany than <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and is a role model for other countries.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, West Chester was {{the center}} of {{penicillin}} production. West Chester-born chemist G. Raymond Rettew became locally famous in the 1930s through breeding mushroom spawn. After the Pearl Harbor attacks, Rettew turned his attention toward penicillin as an antibiotic and built a laboratory in a converted auto garage in West Chester. Prior to his work, penicillin was mainly seen as a laboratory curiosity. In a partnership with Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Rettew constructed a new building with refrigerators and a 100-gallon tank to aid mass production. Rettew delivered his first batch to the government in June 1943, and over 90 percent was delivered to the military. In November 1943, Rettew was producing 32,000 cultures every day. Throughout the war, Rettew's laboratory produced more penicillin than <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and saved an estimated 100,000 American lives.|$|E
