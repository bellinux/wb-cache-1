5|$|The {{resulting}} Mk. XIV {{was first}} tested in June 1941. It {{was the first}} modern bombsight that allowed for accurate bombing immediately after radical manoeuvring, with a settling time as little as 10 seconds. The fast settling time was invaluable during night bombing missions, as it allowed the bomber to fly a corkscrew (a helical path), climbing and turning and then level out immediately before the drop. Even slow turns {{made it difficult for}} night fighters to track the bombers within the limited view of their radar systems and continually changing altitude was <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> avoid anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of its development, the Sharingan will grant the user three unique abilities: The first being its famous ability for the user to {{instantly}} memorize and replicate any opponent's movement and attacks with perfect accuracy. The Sharingan's second ability grants the user increased ocular perception, allowing them to read and predict the movements and actions of fast-moving objects. This also allows the user to easily recognize genjutsu and different forms of chakra (i.e.: to visualize chakra in different colors). Its final ability is a brand of scenarios that suggests actions and thoughts to the opponent, acting as <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> produce beyond genjutsu abilities or implant memories in another person.|$|E
5|$|Wine was {{considered}} the basic drink, consumed at all meals and occasions by all classes and was quite inexpensive. Cato the Elder once advised cutting his rations in half to conserve wine for the workforce. Many types of drinks involving grapes and honey were consumed as well. Drinking {{on an empty stomach}} was regarded as boorish and a sure sign for alcoholism, the debilitating physical and psychological effects of which were known to the Romans. An accurate accusation of being an alcoholic was <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> discredit political rivals. Prominent Roman alcoholics included Marcus Antonius, and Cicero's own son Marcus (Cicero Minor). Even Cato the Younger was known to be a heavy drinker.|$|E

25|$|Stratification, {{also called}} moist-chilling, breaks down {{physiological}} dormancy, and involves {{the addition of}} moisture to the seeds so they absorb water, and they are then subjected to a period of moist chilling to after-ripen the embryo.

Individuals who believe that mastery can be achieved through training and practice are more likely to develop greater self-efficacy than those who see mastery as a product of inherent talent than is largely immutable.|$|E
25|$|The {{linearity}} {{requirement is}} demanding, especially for transmitter RF output circuitry where amplifiers are often {{designed to be}} non-linear in order to minimise power consumption. In practical OFDM systems {{a small amount of}} peak clipping is allowed to limit the PAPR in a judicious trade-off against the above consequences. However, the transmitter output filter which is required to reduce out-of-band spurs to legal levels has the effect of restoring peak levels that were clipped, so clipping is not <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reduce PAPR.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The uses of {{herbicides}} {{have become}} an integral part of modern agricultural systems. The intensive use of herbicides atrazine has resulted in serious environmental problems.

The results found two strains had a high capability for degrading atrazine in soil and culture medium. The mixed strains was more efficient in the mineralization of atrazine than the isolated strain in soil.

As of August 2016, these were awaiting testing. CRISPR is being applied to develop tissue-based treatments for cancer and other diseases.|$|E
25|$|The English {{language}} service of Radio Luxembourg began in 1933 {{as one of}} the earliest commercial radio stations broadcasting to the UK and Ireland. It was an important forerunner of pirate radio and modern commercial radio in the United Kingdom. It was <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> advertise products by circumventing British legislation which until 1973 gave the BBC a monopoly of radio broadcasting on UK territory and prohibited all forms of advertising over the domestic radio spectrum. It boasted the most powerful privately owned transmitter in the world (1,300kW broadcasting on medium wave). In the late 1930s, and again in the 1950s and 1960s, it captured very large audiences in Britain and Ireland with its programmes of popular entertainment.|$|E
25|$|Missionaries {{were not}} {{reluctant}} to take military action if they considered it <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Christianize Japan. They often associated military action against Japan with the conquest of China. They thought that well-trained Japanese soldiers who had experienced long civil wars would help their countries conquer China. For example, Alessandro Valignano said to the Philippine Governor {{that it was impossible}} to conquer Japan because the Japanese were very brave and always received military training but that Japan would benefit them when they would conquer China. Francisco Cabral also reported to the King of Spain that priests were able to send to China two or three thousand Japanese Christian soldiers who were brave and were expected to serve the king with little pay.|$|E

25|$|Many {{traditional}} feedstocks for biodiesel, such as {{corn and}} palm, {{are also used}} as feed for livestock on farms, {{as well as a}} valuable source of food for humans. Because of this, using them as biofuel reduces the amount of food available for both, resulting in an increased cost for both the food and the fuel produced. Using algae as a source of biodiesel can alleviate this problem in a number of ways. First, algae is not used as a primary food source for humans, meaning that it can be used solely for fuel and there would be little impact in the food industry. Second, many of the waste-product extracts produced during the processing of algae for biofuel {{can be used as a}} sufficient animal feed. This is <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> minimize waste and a much cheaper alternative to the more traditional corn- or grain-based feeds.|$|E
25|$|During the campaign, Nixon {{also used}} as a theme his {{opposition}} to the decisions of Chief Justice Earl Warren. Many conservatives were critical of Chief Justice Warren for using the Supreme Court to promote liberal policies in the fields of civil rights, civil liberties, and {{the separation of church and}} state. Nixon promised that if he were elected president, he would appoint justices who would take a less-active role in creating social policy. In another campaign promise, he pledged to end the draft. During the 1960s, Nixon had been impressed by a paper he had read by Professor Martin Anderson of Columbia University. Anderson had argued in the paper for an end to the draft and the creation of an all-volunteer army. Nixon also saw ending the draft as <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> undermine the anti-Vietnam war movement, since he believed affluent college-age youths would stop protesting the war once their own possibility of having to fight in it was gone.|$|E
25|$|The {{human need}} for art, on this view, {{stems from the}} need for {{cognitive}} economy. A concept is already a sort of mental shorthand standing for {{a large number of}} concretes, allowing a human being to think indirectly or implicitly of many more such concretes than can be held explicitly in mind. But a human being cannot hold indefinitely many concepts explicitly in mind either—and yet, on the Objectivist view, needs a comprehensive conceptual framework to provide guidance in life. Art offers {{a way out of this}} dilemma by providing a perceptual, easily grasped means of communicating and thinking about a wide range of abstractions, including one's metaphysical value-judgments. Objectivism regards art as <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> communicate a moral or ethical ideal. Objectivism does not, however, regard art as propagandistic: even though art involves moral values and ideals, its purpose is not to educate, only to show or project. Moreover, art need not be, and usually is not, the outcome of a full-blown, explicit philosophy. Usually it stems from an artist's sense of life (which is preconceptual and largely emotional).|$|E
