5|$|After the Simpsons {{have left}} the museum, they head for Krusty Burger where they {{discover}} Krusty crying in a ball pit. Krusty is encouraged by them into making a comeback, and they inform him that they met an agent that can help him out. However, when they <b>all</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Annie's office, Annie instantly recognizes Krusty and angrily slams the door before he {{gets a chance to}} enter. It is revealed that Annie was the one who discovered Krusty, became his first agent, and was responsible for his rise to success. They also had a romantic relationship together. However, once he achieved fame, Krusty fired Annie and replaced her with a more acclaimed agent, and as a result their relationship ended. Back in the present, he begs her to take him back as a client, and she eventually accepts.|$|E
5|$|Following Dana's murder, {{the killer}} uses her {{cellphone}} {{to call the}} girls. Figuring out that something is wrong, they go outside to look for her. There, they discover Eve's decapitated head inside her car. Realizing there is a killer out there, Kelli calls 9-1-1, {{only to be told}} that due to the snowstorm, help would be unavailable for at least two hours. When their housemother Mrs. Mac and Heather decide to take the car and reach the police station on their own, Kelli, Leigh and Melissa <b>all</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Lauren's room to see them through their window and make sure they leave safely. Noticing that the car has started but they're not leaving, Kelli and Leigh go to check on them through the basement where Leigh slips on Mrs. Mac's blood, who had gotten killed by a falling icicle. Going back to Lauren's room, after a quick confrontation between Leigh and Kyle, they realize that Lauren has also been killed and despite protest from Kyle, decide to go to the attic in case any of the girls are still alive.|$|E
5|$|Monarchs {{sometimes}} went {{to great}} lengths to prevent this. On her marriage to Louis XIV of France, Maria Theresa, daughter of Philip IV of Spain, was forced to renounce her claim to the Spanish throne. When monarchs or heirs apparent wed other monarchs or heirs, special agreements, sometimes in the form of treaties, were negotiated to determine inheritance rights. The marriage contract of Philip II of Spain and Mary I of England, for example, stipulated that the maternal possessions, as well as Burgundy and the Low Countries, were to pass to any future children of the couple, whereas the remaining paternal possessions (including Spain, Naples, Sicily, Milan) would first of <b>all</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Philip's son Don Carlos, from his previous marriage to Maria Manuela of Portugal. If Carlos were to die without any descendants, only then would they pass to the children of his second marriage. On the other hand, the Franco-Scottish treaty that arranged the 1558 marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots and Francis, the son and heir of Henry II of France, had it that if the queen died without descendants, Scotland would fall to the throne of France.|$|E

25|$|The next evening, Laura {{goes to the}} Roadhouse to {{meet her}} drug {{connections}} and have sex with strange men. Unexpectedly, Donna shows up. They <b>all</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Pink Room. Laura discusses Teresa Banks's murder with Ronette Pulaski, and Ronette says that Teresa was trying to blackmail someone. When she sees a topless Donna making out with a stranger, a distraught Laura takes her home and begs Donna not to become like her. The next morning, Philip Gerard, the one-armed man possessed by the repentant demon MIKE, {{in an attempt to}} warn Laura about her father and Bob, pulls up alongside Leland's car and shows Teresa's ring to Laura.|$|E
500|$|In June 2007, Governor T. V. Rajeswar {{said that}} there was {{insufficient}} evidence to prosecute her. In his 23-page order, he said: [...] "the fact that the Mission Management Board, consisting of officers of both the State and the Central Government, regularly met and discussed the project and the fact that even a sum of [...] 17 crores was spent through the Central Government public sector undertaking, NPCC, <b>all</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> show that the serious offences with which Mayawati and the Minister were charged do not stand scrutiny." [...] Advocates unsuccessfully challenged the governor's decision in court. The Supreme Court rejected the plea of the CBI and refused to direct the governor to prosecute her. The Taj corridor case was effectively ended before going to trial.|$|E
500|$|While {{waiting to}} perform, Ringo {{is forced to}} look after Paul's {{grandfather}} and decides {{to spend some time}} alone reading a book. Paul's grandfather, a [...] "villain, a real mixer", convinces him to go outside to experience life rather than reading books. Ringo goes off by himself. He tries to have a quiet drink in a pub, takes pictures, walks alongside a canal, and rides a bicycle along a railway station platform. While the rest of the band frantically and unsuccessfully attempts to find Ringo, he is arrested for acting in a suspicious manner. Paul's grandfather joins him shortly after attempting to sell photographs wherein he forged the boys' signatures. Paul's grandfather eventually makes a run for it and tells the rest of the band where Ringo is. The boys <b>all</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the station to rescue Ringo but end up running away from the police back to the theatre ("Can't Buy Me Love") and the concert goes ahead as planned. After the concert ("Tell Me Why", [...] "If I Fell", [...] "I Should Have Known Better", [...] "She Loves You"), the band is taken away from the hordes of fans via helicopter.|$|E

2500|$|The central {{character}} in the Flaxborough Chronicles, Inspector Walter Purbright, is perhaps not the most intellectually dazzling detective in fiction. [...] He does, though, provide an unusually solid core of decency and civilisation around which more fanciful and sometimes whimsical events can be strung. [...] His understanding of the case in hand emerges from a process of polite, measured enquiry. [...] Purbright's decency {{is at the heart}} of Watson's thesis: that civilised life depends on basic tolerance, decency and the honesty of its guardians. [...] His commitment to total impartiality, his refusal to be deflected by special interests and social position and his scrupulous refusal to cut procedural corners <b>all</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> make up a quintessentially English hero.|$|E
2500|$|In the DVD commentary, Verhoeven states his {{intentions}} clearly: the film's {{message is that}} [...] "War makes fascists of us all". He evoked Nazi Germany's fashion, iconography and propaganda because he {{saw it as a}} natural evolution of the post-World War II United States. [...] "I've heard this film nicknamed All Quiet On the Final Frontier", he says, [...] "which is actually not far from the truth." [...] Edward Neumeier (who had previously worked with Verhoeven on RoboCop) broadly concurs, although he sees a satire on human history rather than solely the United States. Verhoeven says his satirical use of irony and hyperbole is [...] "playing with fascism or fascist imagery to point out certain aspects of American society... of course, the movie is about 'Let's <b>all</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war and let's all die.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Finally, {{with only}} [...] {{left in the}} stage, Benoît Joachim and Laurent Mangel came free. The [...] team {{at the head of}} the peloton was uninterested in chasing them down, since only a stage win was on offer this day, with the overall standings very {{unlikely}} to change. Little by little, sixteen others joined them. They did not work cohesively; Mangel, Stefano Garzelli, Ricardo Serrano, José Luis Rubiera, Pietro Caucchioli, and Pablo Lastras took two minutes' advantage over the other twelve. This mattered little, as the apathetic peloton let them <b>all</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> contest the stage amongst themselves. Garzelli put in an attack on the third-category Bannberg climb, [...] from the end of the race, and stayed out front for the stage win. The main field, led home by László Bodrogi, was 8 minutes and 10 seconds back, but there was no significant change to the overall classification.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Marshall wrote a {{detailed}} case {{for saying that}} the sleeping aspect of the demonstration, while overlooked by the majority, was a central part for the homeless cause.It is true that we <b>all</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep {{as part of our}} daily regimen and that, for the most part, sleep represents a physical necessity and not a vehicle for expression. But these characteristics need not prevent an activity that is normally devoid of expressive purpose from being used as a novel mode of communication. Sitting or standing in a library is a common-place activity necessary to facilitate ends usually having nothing to do with making a statement. Moreover, sitting or standing is not conduct that an observer would normally construe as expressive conduct. However, for Negroes to stand or sit in a [...] "whites only" [...] library in Louisiana in 1965 was powerfully expressive; in that particular context, those acts became [...] "monuments of protest" [...] against segregation.|$|E
2500|$|Upon his return, Reavis visited New York {{to renew}} his acquaintances with various {{political}} and business leaders. [...] Showing his recently acquired documents to these luminaries netted Reavis several useful endorsements. [...] James Broadhead, who in 1884 believed the claim would be denied, followed his examination [...] by proclaiming, [...] "The Peralta claim has been submitted to Mr. Conkling, Mr. Ingersoll and Mr. Hurd who have pronounced it good. [...] I have {{associated with them}} in the case and my opinion coincides with theirs. [...] Mr. J. Addison Reavis is the gentleman who is pushing the claim and his is a man of remarkable energy and persistence." [...] Roscoe Conkling in turn stated [...] "I can say, however, that having been consulted ... and having made a somewhat careful examination of the ancient papers and other papers produces, of which there are many, and on the facts and history of the case, I find they <b>all</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> show Mrs. Reavis to be the person she believes herself to be, namely the lineal descendant of the original grantee." [...] In addition to the endorsement, Conkling introduced Reavis to Robert G. Ingersoll. [...] Ingersoll was so impressed by Peralta papers that he agreed to represent Reavis in his efforts to have the new claim confirmed.|$|E
