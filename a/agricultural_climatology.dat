40|$|During {{the last}} few decades {{scientific}} researches in different fields of agricultural sciences have been grown drastically. However, there is no published study, if any, on structural analysis of the national agricultural research system of Iran and setting priorities for the future. In the present study 2361 scientific papers published during the three decades in the domestic journals were surveyed to analyze the research structure, gaps and priorities. The papers were categorized based on crop species, temporal and spatial scale of experiments, subject and type of the researches and the results were subjected to the statistical analysis. Number of published papers followed a sigmoid growth further with a long lag period of 10 years and leveled off at 240 papers per year. Cereals and industrial crops had the highest frequency in the surveyed papers while forage, medicinal and pulse crops were the next abundant species, respectively. Annual experiments (83 % of total papers) were the most frequent for all crops however, less than 10 % of papers were the result of biannual experiments (> 2 years). In addition frequency of experiments conducted in research stations and protected environments (laboratory and greenhouse) were 58 and 30 %, respectively indicating the small contribution of studies at regional/national scale. Management practices were the most prevalent topics among the papers (35 % of total). However, sustainability of agroecosystems, <b>agricultural</b> <b>climatology</b> and crop modeling were less frequent subjects...|$|E

40|$|Since 1978 {{scientists}} from the Center for <b>Agricultural</b> Meteorology and <b>Climatology</b> at the University of Nebraska have been conducting research at the Sandhills Agricultural Laboratory {{on the effects of}} water stress on crop growth, development and yield using remote sensing techniques. We have been working to develop techniques, both remote and ground-based, to monitor water stress, phenological development, leaf area, phytomass production and grain yields of corn, soybeans and sorghum. Because of the sandy soils and relatively low rainfall at the site it is an excellent location to study water stress without the necessity of installing expensive rainout shelters. The primary objectives of research with the airborne imaging spectrometer (AIS) data collected during an August 1984 flight over the Sandhills Agricultural Laboratory are to evaluate the potential of using AIS to: (1) discriminate crop type; (2) to detect subtle architectural differences that exist among different cultivars or hybrids of agronomic crops; (3) to detect and quantify, if possible, the level of water stress imposed on the crops; and (4) to evaluate leaf area and biomass differences for different crops...|$|R
40|$|My {{research}} interests and experience span {{a wide range}} of topics, from time series to random fields and longitudinal data analysis. I work on developing cutting-edge statistical methodologies and related empirical research to solve problems for regularly as well as irregularly (missing values) observed processes in above mentioned areas. To study the impact of the proposed methodology, I have also applied it to diverse areas, including agriculture science; climatology; health care; medical image studies; mortality studies and transportation. This interdisciplinary nature of statistical methodology and the interplay between theory and application are the main driving forces of my research work. For my dissertation, I am working on “Prediction and Estimation of Random Fields ” with applications in <b>climatology,</b> <b>agricultural</b> and medical studies. The proposed approach is extremely promising as it is based on fundamental ideas from frequency domain time series, and is statistically and computationally simple {{so that it can be}} implemented in standard software packages. My long term goal is to continue working on the core of spatial statistics and study its new applications, particularly in collaborative work with scientists in other fields to solve real problems. In the following, I will provide a brief summary of the research undertaken in my dissertation together with accomplishments and future research plans...|$|R
40|$|The {{first half}} of the 20 th century was an era of {{weathering}} heights. As the development of powered flight made the free atmosphere militarily and economically relevant, meteorologists encountered new kinds of weather conditions at altitude. Pilots also learned to weather heights, as they struggled to survive in an atmosphere that revealed surprising dangers like squall lines, fog, icing, and turbulence. Aeronautical meteorology evolved out of these encounters, a heterogeneous body of knowledge that included guidelines for routing aircraft, networks for observing the upper air using scientific instruments, and procedures for synthesizing those observations into weather forecasts designed for pilots. As meteorologists worked to make the skies safe for aircraft, they remade their science around the physics of the free atmosphere. The dissertation tracks a small group of Scandinavian meteorologists, the “Bergen School,” who came to be the dominant force in world meteorology by forecasting for Arctic exploration flights, designing airline weather services, and training thousands of military weather officers during World War II. After the war, some of these military meteorologists invented the TV weather report (now the most widely consumed genre of popular science) by combining the narrative of the pre-fight weather briefing with the visual style of comic-illustrated training manuals. The dissertation argues that aeronautical meteorology is representative of what I call the “infrastructural sciences,” a set of organizationally intensive, purposefully invisible, applied sciences. These sciences enable the reliable operation of large technological systems by integrating theory-derived knowledge with routine environmental observation. The dissertation articulates a set of characteristics for identifying and understanding infrastructural science, and then argues that these culturally modest technical practices play a pervasive role in maintaining industrial lifeways. It concludes by noting that while meteorology successfully helped aviation become a reliable, taken-for-granted part of the transportation system, the interests of aviation created a meteorology that centered on the needs of pilots, to the detriment of fields like <b>agricultural</b> <b>climatology.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Soil erosion {{research}} {{in the fields of}} agronomy, soils science and mechanics, <b>agricultural</b> engineering, hydrology, <b>climatology,</b> and other scientific disciplines has economic dimensions. In general, measurable and, at times, significant economic effects are associated with the effects of erosion in the other disciplines. Interactions between climate, soils, hydrology, and tillage practices are incorporated into a stochastic simulation model that considers twenty six combinations of five tillage systems, three initial soil depths, two soil associations, two slope classes, and two annual precipitation levels over one hundred years. The model endogeneously determines stochastic annual soil loss. Yield is a function of varying soil depth and technological advance. The model maximizes the wheat producer's objective, 100 -year discounted quasi-rents from wheat production. Cumulative or total rent distributions that derive from alternative tillage systems in the different ecological circumstances are compared under stochastic dominance. In low rainfall, shallow soil areas, annual tillage systems were preferred to fallow ones, while conservation tillage dominated plow tillage. In high rainfall areas, for either shallow or deep soil, conservation tillage dominated plow tillage, while plow tillage dominated no-till. Manipulation of the tillage-associated rent distributions permitted the estimation of value-of-marginal product or willingness to pay curves (ordinary, profit-maximizing, input demand curves) that express the depth of soil as a function of its economic worth. Properties of these curves are discussed. Comparison of expected total returns and marginal returns to topsoil increments under alternative tillage systems in defined ecological circumstances paralleled the stochastic dominance results. Rankings of tillage systems by expected total returns differed between ecological areas and differed from rankings by marginal returns. Regardless of tillage system or ecological circumstances, the economic worth of each added soil increment diminished. The experiment showed that differential rates of soil loss associated with different tillage systems influence the decision to continue using or to initially invest in alternative tillages, and also influence the economically rational wheat producer's willingness to incur costs associated with soil conservation. Total and marginal rents associated with single tillages were found to vary greatly across ecological circumstances. The ability and the willingness to invest in soil conservation were somewhat divorced. This result has significance for soil conservation targeting...|$|R
