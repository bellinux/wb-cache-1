25|$|Digital instruments, which {{necessarily}} incorporate amplifiers, use {{the same}} principles as analog instruments for resistance readings. For resistance measurements, usually a small constant current is passed through the device under test and the digital multimeter reads the resultant voltage drop; this eliminates the scale compression found in analog meters, but requires a source of precise current. An <b>autoranging</b> digital multimeter can automatically adjust the scaling network so the measurement circuits use the full precision of the A/D converter.|$|E

40|$|We {{previously}} discussed the halfbridge converter {{and its use}} in the off-line switching power supply. Remember, off-line {{is defined as a}} power supply whose input rectifier circuits operate directly from the ac power line without transformer isolation. This article discusses the flyback converter and its use in off-line <b>autoranging</b> power supplies. We have two new terms, flyback converter and <b>autoranging,</b> to define and relate to each other. First, letâ€™s look at the flyback converter in Figure 1 and describe its operation. Transistors Q 1 and Q 2 are power field-effect transistors (FET) that are in series and are switched simultaneously. Both Q 1 and Q 2 are turned on, initiating current flow in the primary of T 1. The primary current (Ipri) is a linear ramp whose rise time is controlled by the magnetizing inductance of the power transformer T 1. The output rectifier D 3 is reverse biased during this period so that the energy is stored in the magnetic field of T 1. When Q 1 and Q 2 are turned off, the collapsing magnetic field reverses the voltage across the secondary, forcing D 3 to conduct an...|$|E

Other noise reduction methods make use of digital summation, convolution numbers, and the coaddition of scans. The system was designed to digitize the output of an infrared spectrometer and to record it on magnetic tape.

40|$|The Dynamics Explorer Langmuir probe {{instrument}} (DE-LANG), a {{spare unit}} from the Pioneer Venus mission {{that has been}} modified {{to work with the}} DE spacecraft, is described. Two independent sensors are connected to individual adaptive sweep voltage circuits that continuously track the changing electron temperature and spacecraft potential while <b>autoranging</b> electrometers adjust their gain in response to the changing plasma density. The control signals used in achieving this automatic tracking provide a continuous monitor of the ionospheric parameters without telemetering each volt-ampere curve. In addition, internal data storage circuits permit high-resolution, high-data-rate sampling of selected volt-ampere curves for transmission to the ground to verify or correct the inflight processed data...|$|E

40|$|An {{instrument}} {{to measure the}} three-dimensional energy distribution of positive ions in order to study {{the interaction between the}} solar wind and ionized Halley cometary particles was designed. Two sensors measure the distribution from 10 eV to 20 keV once per spacecraft spin and the distribution from 90 eV to 90 keV, with coarse mass discrimination, once every 32 spins. The instrument was turned on September 8, 1985. The performance throughout all testing was nominal. The spacecraft was greater than 10 million km from the earth in the solar wind. The only population identified is the solar wind. The Fast Ion Sensor follows solar wind variations with its <b>autoranging</b> capability.

The observations were conducted from the 220 nm wavelength in the ultraviolet out to the 15 micron wavelength in the infrared. Four types of instruments were employed including analog <b>autoranging</b> narrow band radiometers, optical multichannel analyzers, mechanical scanning and film plate spectrometers, and imaging cameras.

40|$|A Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) is an {{interferometric}} instrument configured so {{that the}} optical spectrum of the input to the instrument can be determined from the Fourier transform of the output. Spectral resolution {{is proportional to the}} maximum path differences in the interferometer. The Kitt Peak 1 -Meter FTS is a high resolution instrument featuring a one-meter maximum path difference. The instrument is of the continuous motion type and utilizes equal time sampling of the interferogram. Realization of the potential of a one-meter path difference instrument requires very precise path difference positioning. Static and dynamic position accuracies of approximately seven Angstrom units are achieved in this instrument. Path difference command and control is accomplished through use of phase-lock techniques. A key element in the implementation is a Zeeman frequency stabilized Zeeman laser. Stabilization is accomplished by phase-locking the Zeeman frequency to a quartz crystal controlled system reference frequency. Path position information is derived by a control position interferometer which utilizes the Zeeman laser so that one cycle in phase at the Zeeman frequency corresponds to one wavelength in path difference at the laser optical frequency. Position control is achieved by phase-locking the output of the position control interferometer to a command signal. The command signal is synthesized from the laser Zeeman frequency by an additional phase-lock loop. Two approaches to minimizing spectral ghosts resulting from velocity errors are developed. One technique is applicable to band-pass designs. The second optimizes response of low-pass designs that include a single high-pass pole to reject the average value of the interferogram. Both techniques result in ghost responses improved by factors of at least ten to one-hundred compared with those of conventional data filters. The instrument includes an <b>autoranging</b> analog-to-digital converter with fifteen bits of resolution and total range of twenty-two bits developed to cope with the large dynamic range of the interferogram. These efforts together with careful design and construction have resulted in a powerful instrument which is in active use...|$|E
