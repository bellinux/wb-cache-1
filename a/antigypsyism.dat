40|$|The Universities {{everywhere}} {{around the}} world are considered to be the most progresive institutions. Usually in Universities are born the most progressive innovations of the humanity - new theories, new research findings, new ideas in the filed of any science. Most of the Nobel prices each year go to University professors and researchers for their progress in the science. One could not imagine that in the Universities there is racism and discrimination, or there could exist <b>antigypsyism.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} discrimination {{as a form}} {{of invisible}} structural power, and how, if it is not addressed, it can undermine efforts to promote the social inclusion of Romani people in the Western Balkans and Central and Eastern Europe. We argue {{that there is a need}} for development practitioners working in Western European aid agencies to be reflective about our own positionality and practice. Through processes of individual and group reflection, aid professionals can become more aware of the operation of invisible power. In the Roma context, this means recognising <b>antigypsyism</b> as historically constructed racism. In this article, we show how invisible power impacts on the lives of Roma people, on social institutions and on the sense of self and position among those who work for ‘Roma inclusion’. We also briefly sketch a process of critical pedagogy that we are working on with the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) that aims to surface invisible power and bring discrimination into the foreground...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} ‘anti-Gypsyism’ aims to refocus public {{policies}} addressing Roma discrimination {{in order to}} place responsibility for combating structural, historically-embedded and systemic forms of racism, discrimination and exclusion towards Roma squarely on state institutions and actors. This report examines {{the ways in which}} policies and funding combat ‘anti-Gypsyism’ in the European Union and selected Member States and assesses the added value of the ‘anti-Gypsyism’ concept, with particular reference to its institutional forms. It explores ways in which these institutional forms could be combated by identifying some ‘promising practices or experiences’ found in five selected EU Member States (Germany, Romania, Spain, Sweden and the UK). These ‘promising practices’ include reactive and proactive measures organised around four main themes: i) national, regional and local institutional responses; ii) training and education activities; iii) access to justice and effective remedies; and iv) media, public attitudes and political discourse. The report further draws conclusions and provides a set of policy recommendations for EU and national policy-makers to effectively combat anti-Gypsyism. The authors highlight that discussions on <b>antiGypsyism</b> should focus not only on its definition, but on the actual outputs of current national and EU policies and a more robust application of EU rule of law and fundamental rights monitoring and reporting mechanisms. A key proposal put forward is to expand the scope of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies to become the EU Framework for National Roma Inclusion and Combating Anti-Gypsyism and to equip it with the necessary authority and means to tackle systematic and institutional manifestations of anti-Gypsyism...|$|E
40|$|The purpose {{with this}} study is to {{investigate}} the experiences some adult Romans have of co-operation between Romani parents and school. The study is based on interviews and has been inspired of critical ethnography and hermeneutic theories. What views have the Romani adults and parents on parental co-operation with school? Which strategy do they see as a practical way for improved parental co-operating with school? The study show that the Romani parents who participated in this study do want a very close co-operation and have used strategies of open communication and giving suggestion on how to co-operate with the schools. One of the informants has had the opportunity to give an in-dept interview and this gives an example of a more diversified picture of the Romani parental patterns in relation to school. The adult Ro-mani group that has been interviewed thinks that a close co-operation with school is very im-portant. One suggestion of improvement from the interviewers is teacher-assistans to improve the schools parental co-operation. There where also suggestions that educational efforts of the school is needed for all students and to include knowledge about who the Romani people are and about their history, culture and language. Some of the parents even showed examples of giving suggestions to teachers to increase the contact by writing in a dairy for each student. The parents in this study also reports of institutionalized <b>antigypsyism</b> and discrimination. In that view the in-dept interview gives an explanation to why the co-operation is believed to be so crucial. There is a fear that the public authorities in somewhat way would hurt the Romani children...|$|E
40|$|A ghostbuster is roaming around Europe: anti-gypsyism. Anti-gypsyism fights against Gypsies, but {{in order}} to fight them, it had to invent them first. Anti-gypsyism is based on an {{apparent}} paradox: it is battling with a ghost, "Gypsies", something which it has concocted by itself. Anti-gypsyism {{is one of the many}} ghostbusters that clouds a large number of collective European or Euro-descendant minds. Like all kinds of ghost-hunting and hallucinations, it requires material, tangible, flesh-and-blood scapegoats. Depending on the time and place, anti-gypsyism scapegoats have been, or still are, people known as Rom, Sinti, Manuš, Calons, Travellers, Romaničel, etc. From the very first meeting with these peoples, <b>antigypsyism</b> has been an ever-expanding cloud. Anti-gypsyism fights against this cloud, and loses, just like Don Quixote against windmills. However, when fighting the cloud actually involves the flesh and blood of its scapegoats, then the Rom, Sinti, etc, pay dearly. Sometimes they succumb, sometimes they flee. Now and then they adapt and sometimes they become stronger than ever. The earthly existence of many Rom, Sinti, etc. depends on self-defence and every day they are obliged to use their intelligence to contain the anti-gypsyism that pursues them. They have to invest both individual and collective energy which could be used much more beneficially. In fact, whenever anti-gypsyism allows them a truce, creativity blossoms in many and others find a serenity that finally turns them into ordinary citizens. This paper simply aims at shedding a little conceptual light. Since anti-gypsyism is a complex phenomenon with a varied history that has only been the object of recent study and comprehension, making a start by trying to explain the terms we use could perhaps be useful in putting a stop to it...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{debates about}} {{national}} identity, belonging and community cohesion can appear {{to suggest that}} ethnicity is a static entity and that ethnic difference {{is a source of}} conflict in itself. "Ethnicities and Values in a Changing World" presents an alternative account of ethnicity and calls into question models of community cohesion that present ethnicity as the source of antagonisms and differences that must be overcome. It suggests instead that ethnicity is itself multiple and changing and is unlikely to be a basis for articulating shared values. This volume brings together an international team of leading scholars in the field of ethnic studies in order to examine innovative articulations of ethnicity and challenge the contention that ethnicity is static or that it necessarily represents traditional values and cultures. Asserting that ethnicity is deployed in part as an expression of values and a model of ethical practice, this book examines displays of ethnicity as assertions of identity and statements about way of life, sense of entitlement and manner of connection to others. "Ethnicities and Values in a Changing World" draws together debates about the articulation of ethnic identity, the nature of our relation to each other and discussions of everyday ethics, thus engaging with discussions of racism, multiculturalism and community cohesion. As such, it will appeal not only to sociologists, but to anyone working in the fields of cultural studies, race and ethnicity, globalization, migration and anthropology.
