5|$|In 1977, {{the title}} {{was used for the}} tenth film in the Eon Productions series. It was the third to star Roger Moore as British Secret Service agent Commander James Bond. Although Fleming had insisted that no film should contain <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plot of the novel, the steel-toothed {{character}} of Horror was included, although under the name Jaws.|$|E
5|$|During {{a routine}} liposuction {{operation}} in Winnetka, Illinois, Dr. Harrison Lloyd (John Juliani) suddenly begins to remove so much fat {{from a patient}} that the patient dies. Following the unusual experience, Lloyd tells Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) that he killed the patient because he was possessed. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is skeptical about Lloyd's claims, believing he's only making it up to escape legal consequences. Mulder inspects the operation room and discovers a pentagram burned into the floor; he begins to suspect that witchcraft might have {{played a part in}} the crime. Meanwhile, the staff at Lloyd's clinic are shocked when another plastic surgeon, Dr. Ilaqua (Paul Raskin), murders an elderly patient by burning a hole through her cheek and neck with a surgical laser, severing her brain stem. Scully interviews Ilaqua, who claims that he cannot remember <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident. Mulder's suspicions are strengthened when he reviews the tape of the second murder, and he sees a pentagram-like pattern on the stomach of the victim.|$|E

25|$|In quoting many of Gamliel's {{ordinances}} the Mishnah {{emphasizes the}} authority of the patriarchal house by recounting the dispute between the patriarch and his deputy Joshua and showing how the latter was forced to yield. The Tosefta omits the ordinances of Gamliel and of Johanan ben Zakkai, and the dispute of the two leaders of the school-house, nor does it mention <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power of any tannaitic dignitary; the Tosefta is here a product of the time of the Amoraim. The dignity of the nasi is not emphasized, because acumen and scholarship prevailed in the schoolhouse, and there was no desire to let old precedences (see Eduyot) come to the fore again. Even the Mishnah contains some additions {{from the time of the}} Amoraim (see, for example, iv.2, where a gap must be filled from the Tosefta).|$|E
25|$|Another {{divisive}} {{issue was}} that of Ireland's relationship with Britain. The United Irishmen from the onset sought a fully independent and representative parliament for Ireland free from the interference of the British establishment, however retaining the Union of Crowns—ideals that followed those of the Patriot Party. Some such as Tone however thought that complete separation would be a blessing for Ireland, yet refrained from mentioning <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort in the society's resolutions. The silence Tone showed at this time on the issue was no doubt shared by others, yet {{there were those who}} opposed such an idea. By the time the society had resolved to establishing an all out republic and instigated the Irish Rebellion of 1798 to achieve it, there were still members who sought the retention of a shared monarch as long as Ireland had a free parliament.|$|E
25|$|Hitler {{tried to}} dissuade the British and the French from interfering in the {{upcoming}} conflict and on 26 August 1939 proposed to make Wehrmacht forces available to Britain in the future. At midnight on 29 August, German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop handed British Ambassador Neville Henderson the list of terms that would allegedly ensure peace in regards to Poland. Under the terms, Poland was to hand over Danzig (Gdańsk) to Germany, and {{there was to be}} a plebiscite (referendum) in the Polish Corridor within the year based on residency from 1919 (not after). When the Polish Ambassador Lipski went to see Ribbentrop on 30 August and said {{that he did not have}} the power to sign <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort, Ribbentrop dismissed him. The Germans announced that Poland had rejected German offer and negotiations with Poland were finished. On 31 August, German units posing as Polish troops staged the Gleiwitz incident near the border city of Gleiwitz. The following morning Hitler ordered hostilities against Poland to start at 04:45 on 1 September.|$|E

500|$|At the time, it {{was almost}} {{unprecedented}} for a film trailer to not actually feature <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film itself; and while Citizen Kane is frequently cited as a ground-breaking, influential film, Simon Callow argues its trailer was no less original in its approach. Callow writes that it has [...] "great playful charm... it is a miniature documentary, almost {{an introduction to the}} cinema... Teasing, charming, completely original, it is a sort of conjuring trick: without his face appearing once on the screen, Welles entirely dominates its five [...] minutes' duration." ...|$|E
500|$|Electric {{toothbrushes}} are {{a popular}} aid to oral hygiene. A user without disabilities, with proper training in manual brushing, {{and with good}} motivation, can achieve standards of oral hygiene at least as satisfactory as the best electric brushes, but untrained users rarely achieve <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kind. Not all electric toothbrushes are equally effective and even a good design needs to be used properly for best effect, but: [...] "Electric toothbrushes tend {{to help people who}} are not as good at cleaning teeth and as a result have had oral hygiene problems." [...] The most important advantage of electric toothbrushes is their ability to aid people with dexterity difficulties, such as those associated with rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E

[...] Before the game, Fincher said [...] "You're a great player Bo...I feel awful sorry about it because {{you are not going to}} be in there very long—about three minutes."

500|$|Great {{personal}} rapport {{developed between}} Smith and his Portuguese counterpart, António de Oliveira Salazar. On first meeting in Portugal in September 1964, the two Prime Ministers found they shared many common views regarding {{race relations in}} their respective countries, Britain's handling of the Commonwealth, and what Smith called the [...] "complacency of the major powers of the free world" [...] {{in the face of}} what the pair saw as inexorable communist expansionism. After hearing Smith's argument in favour of Rhodesian independence, Salazar privately pledged Portugal's complete support. The RF called a new general election for May 1965 and, campaigning on an election promise of independence, won a clean sweep of all 50 [...] "A"-roll seats. A week later, Wilson met with Portuguese Foreign Minister Alberto Franco Nogueira, whom he pressed on Portugal's secret dealings with Rhodesia. Nogueira categorically denied <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort.|$|E

500|$|The first {{mention of}} a Uranian ring system comes from William Herschel's notes {{detailing}} his observations of Uranus in the 18th century, which include the following passage: [...] "February 22, 1789: A ring was suspected". Herschel drew a small diagram of the ring and noted that it was [...] "a little inclined to the red". The Keck Telescope in Hawaii has since confirmed {{this to be the}} case, at least for the ν ring. Herschel's notes were published in a Royal Society journal in 1797. However, in the two centuries between 1797 and 1977 the rings are rarely mentioned, if at all. This casts serious doubt on whether Herschel could have seen <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort while hundreds of other astronomers saw nothing. Still, it has been claimed by some that Herschel gave accurate descriptions of the ν ring's size relative to Uranus, its changes as Uranus travelled around the Sun, and its color.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Excursions In and About Newfoundland During the Years 1839 and 1840, the {{geologist}} Joseph Beete Jukes describes the St. John's water dog. [...] "A thin, short-haired, black dog came off-shore to us to-day. The animal {{was of a}} breed {{very different from what}} we understand by the term Newfoundland dog in England. He had a thin, tapering snout, a long thin tail, and rather thin, but powerful legs, with a lank body, – the hair short and smooth." [...] wrote Jukes. [...] "These are the most abundant dogs in the country...They are no means handsome, but are generally more intelligent and useful than the others...I observed he once or twice put his foot in the water and paddled it about. This foot was white, and Harvey said he did it to [...] "toil" [...] or entice the fish. The whole proceeding struck me as remarkable, more especially as they said he had never been taught <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kind." ...|$|E
500|$|The British steel {{industry}} was protected from more efficient foreign competition by the government's high tariff wall. The BISF, through its control of pricing, could also present {{a united front}} against new competition at home. When the feasibility report was received by the BISF in March 1935 [...] the Federation's chairman, Sir Andrew Duncan, at first reacted positively; his members from the north-east were rather less enthusiastic. Only {{one of the large}} steel firms in the region, the Consett Iron Company, offered support for a Jarrow steelworks, while other BISF members put pressure on London's financial institutions to withhold capital from the new scheme. Reports of such tactics caused great anxiety in the Jarrow area, where the people were desperate for the new works to come about. In a reassuring speech shortly before the November 1935 general election, Baldwin, now leading the National Government, informed his listeners in Newcastle: [...] "There is no truth in any of the reports that either the banks or any other authorities... are making a dead set to prevent <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kind being done in the area".|$|E

500|$|When {{the letter}} was tabled at the Shaw Commission in 1929, Rustam Haidar spoke to Faisal in Baghdad and cabled that Faisal had [...] "no {{recollection}} that he wrote <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort". In January 1930, Haidar wrote to a newspaper in Baghdad that Faisal: [...] "finds it exceedingly strange that such a matter is attributed {{to him as he}} at no time would consider allowing any foreign nation to share in an Arab country". Awni Abd al-Hadi, Faisal's secretary, wrote in his memoirs that he was not aware that a meeting between Frankfurter and Faisal took place and that: [...] "I believe that this letter, assuming that it is authentic, was written by Lawrence, and that Lawrence signed it in English on behalf of Faisal. I believe this letter is part of the false claims made by Chaim Weizmann and Lawrence to lead astray public opinion." [...] According to Allawi, the most likely explanation for the Frankfurter letter is that a meeting took place, a letter was drafted in English by Lawrence, but that its [...] "contents were not entirely made clear to Faisal. He then {{may or may not have}} been induced to sign it", since it ran counter to Faisal's other public and private statements at the time.A 1 March interview by Le Matin quoted Faisal as saying: ...|$|E
500|$|Chief among Burroughs' {{complaints}} was Long's {{questioning of}} the role of instinct in animal learning, something that Burroughs and many scientists of the day accepted without doubt. Long had written that after many years of studying wild animals, he was [...] "convinced that instinct plays a much smaller part than we have supposed; that an animal's success or failure in the ceaseless struggle for life depends, not upon instinct, but upon the kind of training which the animal learns from its mother." [...] In reply to this assertion, Burroughs wrote in [...] "Real and Sham Natural History": [...] "The crows do not train their young. They have no fortresses, or schools, or colleges, or examining boards, or diplomas, or medals of honor, or hospitals, or churches, or telephones, or postal deliveries, or <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort. Indeed, the poorest backwoods hamlet has more of the appurtenances of civilization than the best organized crow or other wild animal community in the land!" [...] Burroughs summed up by deeming Long a fraud, stating that his [...] "book reads like that {{of a man who has}} really never been to the woods, but who sits in his study and cooks up these yarns from things he has read in Forest and Stream, or in other sporting journals. Of real observation there is hardly a vestige in his book; of deliberate trifling with natural history there is no end".|$|E
500|$|After Oakley and Weinstein left The Simpsons, {{they created}} Mission Hill in 1997, {{a show about}} a hip, lazy, 24-year-old {{cartoonist}} named Andy French, and sold it to The WB for a fall 1999 debut. They pitched the show in 1998 [...] "as an animated series for young adults with a sophisticated, Simpsons-style sensibility." [...] They aimed to make the show about realistic issues affecting young adults, which were too mature for The Simpsons. The network was impressed and initially ordered 13 episodes; they ordered five more once the first was completed. Oakley explained: [...] "The audience we're going for is one that's sophisticated, that likes high and low humor, that's very savvy in animation. [...] this show is definitely a case {{where a lot of}} people don't get it. It's not setup, setup, setup, punch line. It's observational humor. It's jokes told in a weird way, in the background or with a bizarre sound effect." [...] The show was plagued by [...] "public relations" [...] difficulties, which meant it was [...] "tarnished" [...] from the start. A badly edited two-minute promotional video for the show, sent to advertisers in April 1999 for the annual upfronts, was poorly received. Oakley and Weinstein had been informed that the upfronts did not matter. Similarly, because no episodes were finished in time, journalists were not able to see <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show at the network's schedule presentation in July. Subsequently, as Weinstein commented to the Washington Post, [...] "for seven months, the only impression people had of the show was based on a two-minute tape that looked terrible. Six major publications panned it before they even saw it." [...] The pilot garnered largely negative reviews from publications such as The Deseret News; and earned a positive write-up in Variety. Furthermore, the show was forced to change from its originally planned title of The Downtowners due to its closeness to an MTV show. All of these factors combined to ensure the show received little attention, and the WB ran only a few commercials for it. Weinstein stated: [...] "I don't know exactly why America doesn't know about this show. It's like Teen People came out with its fall preview, and we're not even in it." [...] Mission Hill came {{at a time when the}} TV schedules were already saturated with animated shows; some of the response could be chalked up to its genre.|$|E
