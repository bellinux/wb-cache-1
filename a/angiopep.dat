50|$|ANG1005 is a paclitaxel-Angiopep-2 conjugate. Various <b>Angiopep</b> vectors {{have been}} {{composed}} and differ by their anti-cancer moieties. This has then {{been shown to}} be a prospective cancer therapy drug that can not only be conjugated to paclitaxel but also peptides, monoclonal antibodies, siRNA and many other biological aspects. ANG1005 has the potential to treat a variety of CNS diseases including glioma. Research has shown reduction in tumor growth in mice and rats with glioblastoma.|$|E
40|$|A {{targeted}} {{drug delivery}} nanosystem for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) based on polymersomes (Ps) made of poly(dimethylsiloxane) -poly(2 -methyloxazoline) (PDMS-PMOXA) diblock copolymers {{was developed to}} evaluate their potential to actively target brain cancer cells and deliver anticancer drugs. <b>Angiopep</b> 2 was conjugated {{to the surface of}} preformed Ps to target the low density lipoprotein receptor related protein I that are overexpressed in blood brain barrier (BBB) and glioma cells. The conjugation efficiency yield for <b>angiopep</b> 2 was estimated to be 24 %. The <b>angiopep</b> 2 -functionalized Ps showed no cellular toxicity after 24 h and enhanced the cellular uptake around 5 times more in U 87 MG glioblastoma cells compared to the non-targeted Ps. The encapsulation efficiency of doxorubicin (DOX) in Ps was 13 % by co-solvent method, compared to a film rehydration method (4 %). The release profiles of the DOX from Ps showed a release of 42 % at pH 5. 5 and 40 % at pH 7. 4 after 24 h, indicating that Ps can efficiently retain the DOX with a slow release rate. Furthermore, the in vitro antiproliferative activity of DOX-loaded Ps-Angiopep 2 showed enhanced toxicity to U 87 MG glioblastoma cells, compared to non -targeted Ps. Overall, our in vitro results suggested that <b>angiopep</b> 2 -conjugated Ps can be used as nanocarriers for efficient targeted DOX delivery to glioblastoma cells...|$|E
30|$|Cationic cell-penetrating {{peptides}} (CPPs) {{can facilitate}} the internalization of attached macromolecules and even nano-carriers (e.g., polymers, liposomes) by various cells via independent transporters and receptor-mediated endocytosis [21, 22]. A number of CPPs including trans-activating transcriptional activator (TAT), <b>angiopep,</b> penetratin, rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG), prion peptide, and SynB {{have already been}} demonstrated the ability of improving drug delivery across the BBB [23, 24]. Peptide Tat (YGRKKRRQRRR), derived from TAT protein, can increase the permeability of brain endothelial cells by inhibiting occludin expression and cleaving occludin via matrix metalloproteinase- 9 [25]. It has been demonstrated that Tat-conjugated nanoparticles can deliver siRNA and drug across the BBB to kill intracerebral malignant glioma cells and further extend the mouse life span [26]. On the other hand, the permeation mechanism and the precise location of the particles across the BBB remain poorly understood at a cellular level [27]. In vitro BBB model may keep the status of BBB integrity, which helps to {{be understood in terms}} of how BBB facilitate or interfere with drug delivery [28].|$|E
40|$|By {{controlling}} {{access to}} the brain, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts the entry of proteins and potential drugs to cerebral tissues. We demonstrate here the transcytosis ability of apro-tinin and peptides derived from Kunitz domains using an in vitro model of the BBB and in situ brain perfusion. Aprotinin trans-cytosis across bovine brain capillary endothelial cell (BBCEC) monolayers is at least 10 -fold {{greater than that of}} holo-trans-ferrin. Sucrose permeability was unaffected by high concentra-tions of aprotinin, indicating that transcytosis of aprotinin was unrelated to changes in the BBCEC monolayer integrity. Align-ment of the amino acid sequence of aprotinin with the Kunitz domains of human proteins allowed the identification and de-sign of a family of peptides, named <b>Angiopeps.</b> These peptides, and in particular Angiopep- 2, exhibit higher transcytosis capac...|$|R
40|$|The low-density {{lipoprotein}} receptor-related protein 1 (LRP- 1) is a multiligand endocytic receptor, which plays {{a pivotal role}} in controlling cytoskeleton dynamics during cancer cell migration. Its rapid endocytosis further allows efficient clearance of extracellular ligands. Concanavalin-A (ConA) is a lectin used to trigger in vitro physiological cellular processes, including cytokines secretion, nitric oxide production, and T-lymphocytes activation. Given that ConA exerts part of its effects through cytoskeleton remodeling, we questioned whether it affected LRP- 1 expression, intracellular trafficking, and cell surface function in grade IV U 87 glioblastoma cells. Using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, we found that loss of the cell surface 600 -kDa mature form of LRP- 1 occurs upon ConA treatment. Consequently, internalization of the physiological α 2 -macroglobulin and the synthetic angiopep- 2 ligands of LRP- 1 was also decreased. Silencing of known mediators of ConA, such as the membrane type- 1 matrix metalloproteinase, and the Toll-like receptors (TLR) - 2 and TLR- 6 was unable to rescue ConA-mediated LRP- 1 expression decrease, implying that the loss of LRP- 1 was independent of cell surface relayed signaling. The ConA-mediated reduction in LRP- 1 expression was emulated by the actin cytoskeleton-disrupting agent cytochalasin-D, but not by the microtubule inhibitor nocodazole, and required both lysosomal- and ubiquitin-proteasome system-mediated degradation. Our study implies that actin cytoskeleton integrity is required for proper LRP- 1 cell surface functions and that impaired trafficking leads to specialized compartmentation and degradation. Our data also strengthen the biomarker role of cell surface LRP- 1 functions in the vectorized transport of therapeutic <b>angiopep</b> bioconjugates into brain cancer cells...|$|E
30|$|The {{amelioration}} of Alzheimer’s with AD {{drugs is}} a very promising area of research and several bioactive molecules reach the clinical trials but {{they ran out of}} success. One of the major reasons of this failure is restricted access of drug through BBB. The BBB is anatomically defined as the cerebral microvascular endothelium, which bears different structural organization of vascular beds. It has few alternate transport pathways and tight cell–cell junctions. This ceases the pinocytotic activity and significantly decreased number of intracellular fenestrae. The brain endothelial cells express high levels of active influx/efflux membrane transport proteins including P-glycoprotein, Multidrug Resistance Protein-I, Breast cancer Resistance Protein and have additional degrading enzymes which enable selective permeability of molecules [162]. Nanoparticles have been explored for controlled and target-specific delivery of the drug that can transport across the BBB and increase the uptake of suitable drugs in the brain. Biodistribution of NP drug can be restricted from phagocytic cell populations because the smaller particles can be captured by Küpffer cells. Nanoparticles retain the drugs in blood circulation for a longer time, which facilitates drug ability to interact with specific molecules expressed on the luminal side of BBB endothelial cells. A concentration gradient formed by increased retention of NPs in the brain–blood capillaries coupled with adsorption to capillary walls increases the transport of NPs across the endothelial cell layer for drug delivery. It also solubilizes lipids of endothelial cell membrane resulting in membrane fluidization which in turn opens the tight junction between endothelial cells. This leads to enhanced permeation of the drug through nanoparticulate-mediated endocytosis by endothelial cells followed by drug release within these cells of the brain transcytosis of the NPs with bound drug across the endothelial cell layer, phagocytosis and carrier-mediated transport or by absorptive transcytosis. In this regard, the proper surface functionalization of NPs’ surface (coating or conjugation) is crucial matter of concern. A few examples of surface-customized NPs for this purpose contain thiamine-coated NPs, transferrin-coated nanoparticles, PEG-coated NPs, etc. NPs can be prepared as polymer (chitosan, heparin albumin, etc.) conjugate or could be a fullerenol-cytotoxic conjugate. The additional methods like LipoBridge technology (facilitates temporary opening of tight junctions of BBB) liposomal technology, <b>angiopep</b> (nineteen amino acids containing peptide vector) system shall be included [163]. Recently a group of researchers investigated therapeutic ceria (CeO 2) nanoparticles can remove ROS in mice genetically modified to show the symptoms of AD, strong and recyclable ROS scavengers that shuttle between Ce 3 + and Ce 4 + oxidation states [164]. The nanoparticles were targeted to the mitochondria using a compound called triphenylphosphonium.|$|E
