We develop procedures for a standard linear model with Gaussian data and a non-parametric case based on generalized permutation testing, and demonstrate considerably higher power than Bonferroni estimates at the same FWER when the <b>active</b> <b>hypotheses</b> do cluster.

40|$|Abstract — The {{problem of}} {{detecting}} a single anomalous process among {{a finite number}} M of processes is considered. At each time, {{a subset of the}} processes can be observed, and the observations from each chosen process follow two different distributions, depending on whether the process is normal or abnormal. The objective is a sequential search strategy that mini-mizes the expected detection time subject to an error probability constraint. This problem can be considered as a special case of <b>active</b> <b>hypothesis</b> testing first considered by Chernoff where a randomized strategy, referred to as the Chernoff test, was proposed and shown to be asymptotically (as the error probability approaches zero) optimal. For the special case considered in this paper, we show that a simple deterministic test achieves asymptotic optimality and offers better performance in the finite regime.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers a}} generalization {{of the classical}} hypothesis testing problem. Suppose there are M hypotheses of interest among which only one is true. A Bayesian decision maker is responsible to collect observation samples so as to enhance his information about the true hypothesis in a speedy manner while accounting for the penalty of wrong declaration. In contrast to the classical hypothesis testing problem, at any given time, the decision maker can choose one of the available sensing actions and hence, exert some control over the collected samples' "information content. " This generalization, {{referred to as the}} <b>active</b> <b>hypothesis</b> testing, naturally arises in a broad spectrum of applications such as medical diagnosis, cognition, communication, sensor management, image inspection, generalized search, and group testing. The first part of the dissertation provides a theoretical analysis of the problem of <b>active</b> <b>hypothesis</b> testing. Using results in sequential analysis and dynamic programming, lower bounds for the optimal performance are established. The lower bounds are complementary for various values of the parameters of the problem, and characterize the fundamental limits on the maximum achievable information acquisition rate and the optimal reliability. Moreover, upper bounds are obtained via an analysis of the proposed heuristic policies for dynamic selection of actions. From the obtained bounds, sufficient conditions are provided under which the maximum information acquisition rate and reliability are achieved, establishing the asymptotic optimality of the proposed heuristics. The second part of the dissertation investigates the applications of the first part for three important special cases of the <b>active</b> <b>hypothesis</b> testing. Chapter 5 considers the problem of conveying a message over discrete memoryless channels with noiseless feedback. Chapter 6 studies the problem of two-dimensional search to locate a target in an image against a background of distractors. Finally, in Chapter 7, the problem of active learning for multiclass classification is investigated where the outcomes of label queries are corrupted by noise. In each of these chapters, the results {{in the first part of}} the dissertation are specialized, new results are obtained, and many of the known results are recovered with concise proof...|$|E

30|$|The {{system uses}} context-dependent (CD) and context-independent (CI) {{acoustic}} models that {{are represented by}} continuous density hidden Markov models. These models are mixtures of Gaussian distribution in cepstral domain. In this system, forward, skip and loop transitions between the states are allowed and the covariance matrices are assumed diagonal [6, 9, 10]. The parameters of the emission probabilities are trained using the maximum likelihood criterion and the training procedure is initialized by a linear segmentation. Each iteration of the training procedure consists of time alignment by dynamic programming (Viterbi algorithm) followed by parameter estimation, resulting in segmental k-means training procedure [3, 4]. In decoding phase, a Viterbi-based search with beam and histogram pruning techniques are used. In this module, the recognized acoustic units are used to make <b>active</b> <b>hypotheses</b> via word decoder. The word decoder searches the lexicon tree simultaneously in interaction with the acoustic decoder and the pruning modules. The final <b>active</b> <b>hypotheses</b> are rescored using language models. Both statistical and grammatical language models can be used either in word decoder or in rescoring modules. In Nevisa, by default, statistical LM {{is used in the}} word decoder, i.e., during the search, and the grammatical model is used in n-best re-scoring module optionally.

40|$|In this article, a new {{architecture}} for {{speech recognition}} is introduced. As with many existing speech systems, this new approach involves multi-pass processing.

30|$|Most of {{the work}} on phase {{synchronisation}} and memory {{has been focused on}} theta (4 – 7  Hz) and alpha (8 – 13  Hz) frequency bands because these bands support long-distance cortical interactions [13, 14]. Also, Cognitive functions are often transiently coupled by theta and alpha band phase synchronisation [17]. The theta band is associated with memory maintenance [15] and the gating mechanism during information processing. In addition, activity in this band increases with task difficulty [13]. The dual function of theta oscillations is realised as synaptic plasticity and the segregation of cell assemblies in the available phase space [16]. The theta time compression mechanism restrains the representation of memory and space [16]. The alpha band interactions are the predominant characteristics of planning, perception, as well as working memory function [18]. It is imperative to conceive alpha oscillations in local and large-scale cortical network from the perspectives of two alternative hypotheses: the inhibition <b>hypothesis</b> and the <b>active</b> processing <b>hypothesis.</b> The inhibition hypothesis states that alpha increases in task-irrelevant areas whereas it decreases in task-related areas. The <b>active</b> processing <b>hypothesis</b> postulates that alpha oscillation plays a role in task-relevant regions. Although both hypotheses are contradictory in their fundamentals, but they are necessary to maintain the default mode network, as well as higher cognitive function [18]. Due to the central role of memory in the navigation, we investigated the theta and alpha band during a virtual navigation task. Several studies demonstrated a pronounced role of the theta and alpha band during navigation [19 – 21]. To gain insights into the functional connectivity during navigation, we chose the alpha band for further exploration, as it follows <b>active</b> and inhibition <b>hypotheses</b> which sustain equilibrium. This, in turn, strikes a balance between functional segregation and functional integration in terms of efficient connectivity. It reflects in the functional connectivity where harmony between opposing demands of functional integration and function segregation is maintained for economical networking.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} noisy Bayesian active learning, where we are given a finite set of functions H, a sample space X, and a label set L. One of the functions in H assigns labels to samples in X. The goal is to identify the function that generates the labels even though {{the result of a}} label query on a sample is corrupted by independent noise. More precisely, the objective is to declare one of the functions in H as the true label generating function with high confidence using as few label queries as possible, by selecting the queries adaptively and in a strategic manner. Previous work in Bayesian active learning considers Generalized Binary Search, and its variants for the noisy case, and analyzes the number of queries required by these sampling strategies. In this paper, we show that these schemes are, in general, suboptimal. Instead we propose and analyze an alternative strategy for sample collection. Our sampling strategy is motivated by a connection between Bayesian active learning and <b>active</b> <b>hypothesis</b> testing, and is based on querying the label of a sample which maximizes the Extrinsic Jensen-Shannon divergence at each step.

The distribution of the nodes in the network provides a spatial diversity, which includes the temporal dimension for the purpose of increase the robustness of the ongoing tasks and enhance the probability of data and event detection. In this area, we study the distributed network that contain the collection of a node connected to each other in the distributed manner. The node connected to each other is called neighbor node. In the problem of distributed detection of data, nodes have to decide based on the binary hypotheses of the measured data. In this detection problem we find the fully distributed and adaptive approach where all the node have to make own real time decision by cooperating with their immediate neighbour only and for this implementation no central processing node is required. For this distributed detection, we used diffusion based strategies Diffusion least mean square (DLMS) and Diffusion recursive least mean square(RLS) to find out distributed estimation of the parameter of interest.

40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is {{associated}} with perceptual as well as motor disturbances. Unlike those with right-side onset (RPD), individuals whose motor symptoms begin {{on the left side}} of the body (LPD) may experience mild neglect of left hemispace. The functional cause of these perceptual abnormalities in LPD is unknown; possibilities include altered eye movements, changes in perceptual representation of left versus right hemispace, and attentional abnormalities. Three studies explored these possibilities in non-demented individuals with mild-moderate idiopathic PD (24 - 36 per experiment) and matched normal control adults (NC; 14 - 24 per experiment). Study 1 consisted of two psychophysical line-bisection experiments that used brief stimulus presentations to preclude exploratory eye movements. In both, participants judged whether a systematically adjusted hatchmark was left or rightward of a horizontal line’s midpoint. In the second, eye tracking was used to ensure that participants fixated during stimulus onset. The first experiment revealed neglect-like performance in LPD, but the second did not, suggesting that neglect may arise from biased eye gaze but not from abnormal saccades. Study 2 evaluated two hypotheses to explain spatial bias in LPD; one an <b>active</b> <b>hypothesis</b> in the literature that the representation of left hemispace is compressed, and the other a novel hypothesis that left hemispace is less salient than the right in LPD. Both hypotheses were assessed psychophysically, using spatial frequency and contrast discrimination paradigms, and neither was supported. Study 3 investigated whether endogenous visuospatial attentional abnormalities exist in PD, and particularly whether LPD show weaker attentional abilities in the left hemifield. A multiple-object tracking paradigm was used along with eye tracking to ensure that participants used only endogenous (not exogenous) attention. PD showed dilated temporal resolution of attention, and were less accurate in tracking multiple objects at once. LPD did not differ from RPD for either of these metrics. Overall the results suggest that there is no intrinsic difference in the representation of space in LPD relative to RPD or NC, but that visuospatial attention is altered in PD generally. The latter finding is particularly important for considering spatial navigation in individuals with PD even in early stages of the disease...|$|E

We show that a modification of Chernoff's Procedure A, one that we call Sluggish Procedure A, is asymptotically optimal even with switching costs. The growth rate of the total cost, as the probability of false detection is driven to zero, and as a switching parameter of the Sluggish Procedure A is driven down to zero, is the same as that without switching costs.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} the clustering pattern of alpha band (8 Hz - 12 Hz) electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations obtained from healthy individuals during {{a short time}} memory task with 3 different memory loads. The retention period during which {{subjects were asked to}} memorize a pattern in a square matrix is analyzed with a graph theoretical approach. The functional coupling among EEG electrodes are quantified via mutual information in the time-frequency plane. A spectral clustering algorithm followed by bootstrapping is used to parcellate memory related circuits and for identifying significant clusters in the brain. The main outcome of the study is that the size of the significant clusters formed by alpha oscillations decreases as the memory load increases. This finding corroborates the <b>active</b> inhibition <b>hypothesis</b> about alpha oscillations...|$|R
