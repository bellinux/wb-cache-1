5|$|<b>After</b> <b>Congress</b> {{approved}} the final {{wording of the}} Declaration on July 4, a handwritten copy was sent {{a few blocks away}} to the printing shop of John Dunlap. Through the night, Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides for distribution. Before long, the Declaration was read to audiences and reprinted in newspapers throughout the thirteen states. The first official public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8; public readings also took place on that day in Trenton, New Jersey and Easton, Pennsylvania. A German translation of the Declaration was published in Philadelphia by July 9.|$|E

Having learned that John Archibald Campbell, an Alabaman serving on the Supreme Court, had decided to resign in light of his state's secession, President Lincoln proposed to appoint Crittenden to the vacant seat. Lincoln's cabinet approved, and the nomination papers were drafted, but Campbell belatedly reconsidered his resignation, {{and by the time he}} definitely determined to resign, Lincoln had changed his mind regarding Crittenden's nomination.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} of the monument proceeded quickly <b>after</b> <b>Congress</b> had provided sufficient funding. In four years, it was completed, with the 100-ounce (2.83kg) aluminum apex/lightning-rod being put in place on December 6, 1884. The apex was the largest single piece of aluminum cast at the time, when aluminum commanded a price comparable to silver. Two years later, the Hall–Héroult process made aluminum easier to produce {{and the price of}} aluminum plummeted, making the once-valuable apex more ordinary, though it still provided a lustrous, non-rusting apex that served as the original lightning rod. The monument opened to the public on October 9, 1888.|$|E
5|$|United States President George Washington {{appointed}} 38 United States {{federal judges}} during his presidency, which lasted from April 30, 1789 to March 4, 1797. The {{first group of}} Washington's appointments—two justices of the Supreme Court of the United States and ten district court judges—began service two days <b>after</b> <b>Congress</b> passed the Judiciary Act of 1789, which formally established the federal judiciary. Washington's last court appointee received his commission twelve days {{before the end of}} Washington's presidency.|$|E
5|$|A gold dollar coin {{had been}} {{proposed}} {{several times in}} the 1830s and 1840s, but was not initially adopted. Congress was finally galvanized into action by the increased supply of bullion caused by the California gold rush, and in 1849 authorized a gold dollar. In its early years, silver coins were being hoarded or exported, and the gold dollar found a ready place in commerce. Silver again circulated <b>after</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1853 required that new coins of that metal be made lighter, and the gold dollar became a rarity in commerce even before federal coins vanished from circulation because of the economic disruption caused by the American Civil War.|$|E

5|$|<b>After</b> <b>Congress</b> adjourned on August 6, 1861, Burnett {{returned}} home to Cadiz and spoke {{at a number of}} pro-Southern rallies. On September 4, 1861, Confederate Major General Leonidas Polk violated Kentucky's neutrality by ordering Brigadier General Gideon Johnson Pillow to occupy Columbus. In response, Ulysses S. Grant captured Paducah on September 6, 1861. With neutrality no longer a tenable option, Burnett presided over a conference of Kentucky's Southern sympathizers that occurred at Russellville between October 29 and October 31, 1861. The self-appointed delegates to this conference called for a sovereignty convention on November 18, 1861 for the purpose of establishing a Confederate government for the state.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{nominated}} 41 lower {{federal court}} judges {{in addition to}} his four Supreme Court justices. These included two judges to the United States circuit courts, nine judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 30 judges to the United States district courts. Because Cleveland served terms both before and <b>after</b> <b>Congress</b> eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts of Appeals, he is one of only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies. The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office {{at the time that the}} change was made. Thus, all of Cleveland's appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term, and all of his appointments to the Courts of Appeals were made in his second.|$|E
5|$|Under the Mint Act of 1792, the largest-denomination coin was {{the gold}} eagle, or ten-dollar piece. Also struck were a half eagle ($5) and quarter eagle ($2.50). Bullion flowed {{out of the}} United States for {{economic}} reasons {{for much of the}} late 18th and early 19th centuries. The eagle's size made it convenient for use in international transactions, and, faced with the likelihood that most being struck were exported, the Director of the Mint Elias Boudinot ended its production in 1804. In 1838, coinage resumed <b>after</b> <b>Congress</b> revised the weight and fineness of American gold coins. The new eagle was struck to a design by Christian Gobrecht, {{who was one of the}} Mint's engravers.|$|E

5|$|Washington then {{relocated}} east to Missouri in the 1850s, {{where he}} remained {{for a few}} years and fought as a Border Ruffian during the Bleeding Kansas confrontations over slavery along the border between Kansas Territory and Missouri. While in Missouri, Washington wrote poetry and contributed to local newspapers. He returned to Virginia later in the 1850s. While in Virginia, Washington again applied for a military office in March 1855 under an expansion in the Regular Army <b>after</b> <b>Congress</b> added two new regiments to protect the large additional territory obtained from Mexico. By December 1855, Washington was in Kanawha County where he established a joint stock company to promote emigration to Kansas. He returned to Missouri in 1856, where he continued to serve as a Border Ruffian.|$|E
5|$|While on Washington's staff, Hamilton {{had become}} {{frustrated}} with the decentralized nature of the wartime Continental Congress, particularly its dependence upon the states for voluntary financial support. Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress had no power to collect taxes or to demand money from the states. This lack of a stable source of funding had {{made it difficult for}} the Continental Army both to obtain its necessary provisions and to pay its soldiers. During the war, and for some time <b>after,</b> <b>Congress</b> obtained what funds it could from subsidies from the King of France, from aid requested from the several states (which were often unable or unwilling to contribute), and from European loans.|$|E
5|$|After its {{enactment}} in 1965, the law immediately decreased {{racial discrimination}} in voting. The suspension of literacy tests and assignments of federal examiners and observers allowed for {{high numbers of}} racial minorities to register to vote. Nearly 250,000 African Americans registered in 1965, one-third of whom were registered by federal examiners. In covered jurisdictions, less than one-third (29.3%) of the African American population was registered in 1965; by 1967, this number increased to more than half (52.1%), {{and a majority of}} African American residents became registered to vote in 9 of the 13 Southern states. Similar increases were seen in the number of African Americans elected to office: between 1965 and 1985, African Americans elected as state legislators in the 11 former Confederate states increased from 3 to 176. Nationwide, the number of African American elected officials increased from 1,469 in 1970 to 4,912 in 1980. By 2011, the number was approximately 10,500. Similarly, registration rates for language minority groups increased <b>after</b> <b>Congress</b> enacted the bilingual election requirements in 1975 and amended them in 1992. In 1973, the percent of Hispanics registered to vote was 34.9%; by 2006, that amount nearly doubled. The number of Asian Americans registered to vote in 1996 increased 58% by 2006.|$|E

5|$|During {{the almost}} ten years it served as the capitol, Congress Hall {{witnessed}} many historic events including the admittance of three new states. The United States Bill of Rights was ratified at Congress Hall in 1791. The second Presidential inauguration of George Washington {{took place in the}} House chamber in 1793, as did inauguration of John Adams in 1797. Congress also used the time to establish the First Bank of the United States, the Federal Mint, and the United States Department of the Navy. The Jay Treaty, which secured a temporary peace with Great Britain, was also ratified at Congress Hall in 1796. After the capital moved to Washington, Congress Hall returned to its original function as the Philadelphia County Courthouse and served as the location of both state and federal courts during the early 19th century. Also designed by Samuel Lewis, the Burlington County Courthouse in Mount Holly Township, New Jersey was built in 1796 and modeled <b>after</b> <b>Congress</b> Hall.|$|E
5|$|Early in the Act's {{enforcement}} history, the Supreme Court {{addressed the}} constitutionality of several provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. In Katzenbach v. Morgan (1966), the Court upheld {{the constitutionality of}} Section 4(e). This section prohibits jurisdictions from administering literacy tests to citizens who attain a sixth-grade education in an American school in which the predominant language was Spanish, such as schools in Puerto Rico. Although the Court had earlier held in Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections (1959) that literacy tests did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, in Morgan the Court held that Congress could enforce Fourteenth Amendment rights—such {{as the right to}} vote—by prohibiting conduct it deemed to interfere with such rights, even if that conduct may not be independently unconstitutional. <b>After</b> <b>Congress</b> created a nationwide ban on all literacy tests and similar devices in 1970 by enacting Section 201, the Court upheld the ban as constitutional in Oregon v. Mitchell (1970).|$|E
5|$|In 1801, when Breckinridge was 12 years old, {{his father}} {{was elected to the}} U.S. Senate. The family moved to Bedford County, Virginia, where they lived with {{relatives}} in order to be closer to the elder Breckinridge during the congressional session at Washington, D.C.. While there, Cabell Breckinridge attended New London Academy (now Colby–Sawyer College). A case of measles prevented him from attending William and Mary College (now College of William & Mary), his father's alma mater, where his cousin, future Congressman James Breckinridge, was enrolled. In 1803, he accompanied his father to the capital where he witnessed the debates over the Louisiana Purchase before returning to college in October. <b>After</b> <b>Congress</b> adjourned in March, John Breckinridge met his son in Virginia, and they arrived back at Cabell's Dale, the family estate near Lexington, on April 18, 1804. He did not return to Virginia with his father in late 1804, instead pursuing preparatory studies under Colonel Samuel Wilson in advance of his enrollment at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University).|$|E

5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. Environmental policy {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. <b>After</b> <b>Congress</b> overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E
5|$|Only Maryland and New York had yet {{to authorize}} {{independence}} {{towards the end of}} June. Previously, Maryland's delegates had walked out when the Continental Congress adopted Adams's radical May 15 preamble, and had sent to the Annapolis Convention for instructions. On May 20, the Annapolis Convention rejected Adams's preamble, instructing its delegates to remain against independence. But Samuel Chase went to Maryland and, thanks to local resolutions in favor of independence, was able to get the Annapolis Convention to change its mind on June 28. Only the New York delegates were unable to get revised instructions. When Congress had been considering the resolution of independence on June 8, the New York Provincial Congress told the delegates to wait. But on June 30, the Provincial Congress evacuated New York as British forces approached, and would not convene again until July 10. This meant that New York's delegates would not be authorized to declare independence until <b>after</b> <b>Congress</b> had made its decision.|$|E
