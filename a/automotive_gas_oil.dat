Although, the two pore sizes of the activated carbon were able to achieve almost 100 % reduction of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) and total hydrocarbon content (THC), the 250 µm pore size could only reduce 67. 7 % of the hydrocarbon utilizing fungi count, compared to 70. 4 % by the 500 µm size.

The constraints were cases when each of the crude oil fractions was assumed to be most valuable product. The model equations were solved using multi objective constrained linear programming optimization tool box in MATLAB.

Data were obtained from record of all petroleum products distributed and consumed in Nigeria within this period. These were subjected to the Tier 1 method of greenhouse gas determination using the Reference Approach. Result showed that 518. 84 million metric tons (mmt) of CO 2 was released into the atmosphere between 1990 and 2009. This value represents 0. 26 % when compared with the global value of 202, 640 mmt.

40|$|Over the years, Nigeria have {{witnessed}} different government with different policy measures. Against {{the negative consequences}} of the past policies, the structural adjustment was initiated in 1986. Its aims is to effectively altar and restructure the consumption patterns of the economy as well as to eliminate price distortions and heavy dependence on the oil and the imports of consumer goods and services. Within the period of implementation, there has been a decreasing trend in yearly fish catch landings and sizes but the reverse in shrimping. There is also a gradual shift from fishing to shrimping, from the vessels purchased with 83. 3 % increase of shrimpers from 1985 to 1989. Decreasing fish catch sizes and quantity aggravated by the present high cost of fishing coupled with the favourable export market for Nigeria shrimp tend to influence the sift. This economic situation {{is the result of the}} supply measures of SAP through the devaluation of the Naira. There is also overconcentration of vessels on the inshore waters as majority of the vessels are old and low powers hence incapable of fishing on the deep sea.

40|$|The {{work was}} divided into two {{different}} series of light <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (LLGO) and heavy <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (HGO). The rapeseed oil was blended with the <b>gas</b> <b>oils</b> in the following concentrations: 10 %, 20 % and 30 %. The pressure was maintained constant. The flow rate, temperature were varied. It is possible to blend rape seed oil into HGO and LLGO {{in the production of}} low sulfur diesel fuel. The conversion of the rapeseed oil to hydrocarbon was higher when blended into LLGO compared to HGO. Low reaction temperatures and high flow rates give less amount of conversion of the rape seed oil...|$|R
