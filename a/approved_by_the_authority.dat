5000|$|The {{state-owned}} MediaCorp comprises all free-to-air terrestrial local TV channels {{licensed to}} broadcast in Singapore, {{as well as}} 13 radio stations. In July 2011, Singapore relaxed the Subscription Television Programme Code guidelines allowing Pay TV operators to screen up to M18-rated content programmes containing more graphic content (e.g. sex scenes/nudity, graphic violence, strong language) and mature or sensitive subject matter relating to political issues, racial/religious issues and homosexuality. R21-rated content was still restricted to only Pay TV Video-on-Demand (VOD) services. In July 2016, the MDA officially greenlit R21-rated content for Over-the-Top (OTT) services.However, the English language Pay-TV channels currently available for scheduled broadcast in Singapore comprises only Asian regional channels such as Fox Channel Asia, Star World and WarnerTV, which are outside the editorial control of the Media Development Authority (MDA) as they operate on a regional scale and the same standard of censorship is carried out across the entire region because these channels have to conform with laws from the more conservative areas in Asia, meaning most territories in Asia watch the same censored version. At the moment, only Singapore-owned Video-On-Demand services offer English language programmes that can be regulated by the MDA and therefore, passed uncut under classification ratings such as NC16, M18 and R21. The popular HBO series Sex and the City was pulled from broadcast originally in the late 90s when the series debuted but the ban was later lifted after an earlier relaxation of guidelines in the Subscription Television Programme Code in 2004. Private ownership of satellite dishes is illegal, though international TV news broadcasts (such as CNN, BBC, Fox News Channel, RT, etc.) are available on services such as Starhub TV and SingTel IPTV Singtel TV.The Media Development Authority, through its four Programme Advisory Committees (PAC) {{for each of the}} four official languages, monitors and provides feedback on broadcast content. Permissible content on free-to-air Singaporean TV is regulated by the MDA's Free-to-Air Television Programme Code. The Free-to-Air Television Programme Code states that [...] "all programmes broadcast between 6am and 10pm must be generally acceptable for family audiences. The transition from family-oriented to more adult programming after the watershed time of 10pm should also be executed gradually" [...] Hence, locally produced dramas aired before 10pm tend to be more family-based, with crime-horror-thrillers; etc. at a minimum. PG13 content, which is allowed only after 10pm to 6am, is the maximum rating available for free-to-air television in Singapore. NC16 and M18-rated content are available only on Pay TV channels under the editorial control of the MDA such as Singapore channels E City and VV Drama, both of which owned by Starhub.Part 13.3 of the Code states that use of the local English-based creole Singlish [...] "should not be encouraged and can only be permitted in interviews, where the interviewee speaks only Singlish." [...] The popular Singlish sitcom Phua Chu Kang was singled out in a National Day rally speech. The Programmes Advisory Committee for English TV and Radio Programmes also singled out the use of Singlish in local sitcoms in its 2005 annual report, saying they [...] "contain excessive Singlish" [...] and [...] "this should be avoided as it could give the wrong impression, especially among the young, that Singlish is the standard of spoken English in Singapore" [...] Part 13.4 of the Code states that [...] "All Chinese programmes, except operas or other programmes specifically <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Authority,</b> must be generally in Mandarin." [...] Dialects in dialogues and songs may be allowed provided the context justifies usage and is sparingly used. More leeway of dialects is given for Pay TV channels.In February 2008, the Academy Awards acceptance speech for the short documentary Freeheld was censored by Mediacorp in the rebroadcast of the program due to the filmmakers' mention of equal rights for same-sex couples as it violated the Free-to-air TV Programme Code.|$|E

40|$|As one of {{the most}} biodiverse {{ecosystem}} on the earth, corals supply a lot of valuable biological goods and ecosystem services, yet such sensitive receivers may suffer from sub-lethal or lethal damages caused by direct or indirect impacts arising from coastal or marine development projects. In Hong Kong, a number of mitigations specific to corals have been proposed and implemented under Hong Kong’s EIA Ordinance. However, as no academic review of these mitigations has been done in Hong Kong, we have no idea about the effectiveness of such measures. The primary {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of mitigation measures implemented on corals and to explore how it can be enhanced and strengthened. To achieve this, firstly, all EIA reports <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> were screened for designated projects with significant impacts on corals. These EIA reports were then reviewed so as to gather the necessary information about the predicted impacts and the proposed mitigation measures on corals. Secondly, specific monitoring requirements for the mitigation measures were identified in the corresponding environmental monitoring and audit (EM&A) manuals. Thirdly, the corresponding EM&A reports were studied in order to examine the effectiveness of implemented mitigations. Fourthly, the current mitigation-related procedures/approaches are discussed, compared with those adopted in the international world and recommendations were made for better mitigations in future. Fourteen designated projects are comprehensively reviewed and analysed as they are considered of having significant impacts on corals. Based on the reviewed results, the overall effectiveness of mitigation measures is about 29 %, which seems to be unsatisfactory because 10 of the 14 projects lacked various components in the mitigation process. Discussions of the advantages and disadvantages of the relevant procedures or approaches are made: (a) assessment methods can be improved by providing more description of coral health status other than bleaching; (b) measurable indicators or specifically objective standards should be added to either ecological evaluation or impact assessment; (c) coral transplantations should pay attention to coral reattachments and regular maintenance; (d) post-translocation monitoring need to be enhanced with respect to control indicators, monitoring frequency and duration; (e) the Action and Limit Levels for both non-biological and biological indicators need to be further explored through the implementation of site-specific environmental assessments; (f) transparency of the current EIA system should be reviewed and strengthened. The study demonstrates the low effectiveness of mitigation measures for corals in terms of the mitigation process and mitigation-related methods in Hong Kong. The recommendations for the enhancement include (a) developing a database for tracking the entire mitigation process; (b) showing the on-line EM&A reports in an ordered and appropriate way; (c) evaluating the long-term effects of the existing mitigations; (d) drawing lessons from other countries’ active restorations; (e) establishing a sustainable financing mechanism for long term coral management. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|E
