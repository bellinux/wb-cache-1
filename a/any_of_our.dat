The Board of Reference in South Australia includes business-people, members of the medical profession, as well as ministers and people from Catholic, Baptist, Lutheran, Uniting and other church groups. The rapid national growth of the party leading into this election and the late decision to contest in all seats possible, has meant that in some states there are candidates, with strong family values, who have been introduced to the party through the personal relationships they have from their involvement in community/church networks.|$|E

25|$|Lastly, the British felt {{disenchanted with}} Indian {{reaction}} to social change. Until the rebellion, they had enthusiastically pushed through social reform, like {{the ban on}} sati by Lord William Bentinck. It was now felt that traditions and customs in India were too strong and too rigid to be changed easily; consequently, no more British social interventions were made, especially in matters dealing with religion, even when the British felt very strongly about the issue (as in the instance of the remarriage of Hindu child widows). This was exemplified further in Queen Victoria's Proclamation released immediately after the rebellion. The proclamation stated that 'We disclaim alike our Right and Desire to impose Our Convictions on <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Subjects'; demonstrating official British commitment to abstaining from social intervention in India.|$|E

500|$|It was {{reported}} that Madhur Bhandarkar had been approached to direct the film, but later turned down the offer because of other working commitments. It was confirmed in November 2011 that Vishal Mahadkar, director of Blood Money, was to direct the picture, but the following month {{it was announced that}} Mohit Suri had replaced Mahadkar as director at the last minute. Bhatt confirmed the development, saying [...] "Earlier we had finalised Vishal for the project. But now we have scrapped that idea and found a fresh one. We got Mohit to direct the film". Several media outlets falsely reported that the film is a remake of the Vishesh films 1990 love triangle Awaargi. However, Mahesh Bhatt denied the rumours and said [...] "Aashiqui 2 is not a remake of <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> films. It's an original script. A very contemporary love story dealing with mature emotions." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, The Simpsons {{producers}} {{announced that}} one of their characters was {{going to come out of}} the closet. Speculation on who it would be was printed in newspapers throughout the United States and Canada (even claiming Smithers' [...] "sexual orientation was about the worst-kept secret in Springfield") as well as in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, (the Irish Independent called Smithers [...] "too obvious" [...] a choice), and the United Kingdom. Despite Matt Groening joking that it would be Homer, the Boston Herald calculated the odds of several characters being gay, with Smithers at a million to one. PlanetOut Inc. hosted an online poll in the weeks prior to the episode to determine based on [...] "cartoon gaydar" [...] who was gay on the Simpsons, with 97% of the respondents choosing Smithers. Jenny Stewart, the entertainment editor at the site said of the poll, [...] "We've never had such an avalanche of people voting in <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> polls as we did on The Simpsons."

500|$|In {{early summer}} 1981, while Raiders of the Lost Ark was being promoted, Columbia Pictures met with Speilberg {{to discuss the}} script, after having to develop Night Skies with the {{director}} as the intended sequel to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. However, the head of Columbia Pictures' marketing and research development, Marvin Atonowsky, concluded {{that it had a}} limited commercial potential, believing that it would appeal to mostly young kids. The President of Columbia's worldwide productions, John Veitch, also felt that the script wasn't good or scary enough to draw enough crowd. On the advice of Atonowsky and Veitch, Columbia Pictures CEO Frank Price passed on the project, calling it [...] "a wimpy Walt Disney movie" [...] and thus putting it in a turnaround, so Spielberg approached the more receptive Sid Sheinberg, president of MCA, the then-parent company of Universal Studios. Spielberg told Sheinberg to acquire the E.T. script from Columbia Pictures, which he did for $1 million and struck a deal with Price in which Columbia would retain 5% of the film's net profits. Veitch later recalled that [...] "I think [...] we made more on that picture than we did on <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> films." ...|$|E

Also for The Hindu, Malathi Rangarajan wrote, [...] "Let's celebrate the figment of [...] imagination that has made the housefly appear as invincible as <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> muscle-flexing heroes". Karishma Upadhyay of The Telegraph called the film [...] "a winner from the first frame to the last" [...] and praised Rajamouli's screenplay, writing that it made [...] "the absurd seem real, willing you to accept anything that he throws at you". J.

V. S. Rajapur, Indo-Asian News Service gave Eega four stars out of five, and praised the performances and music; Rajapur was particularly appreciative of the visual effects, saying the hard work put in by the entire team was [...] "clearly visible onscreen". A reviewer from Sify called Eega an [...] "escapist, comic book-like fantasy" [...] that [...] "throws you into an experience so profound that nothing else really matters".|$|E
500|$|For the 30th {{anniversary of}} The Joshua Tree, U2 staged a 2017 concert tour in North America, Europe, and Latin America, {{on which the}} album was played in its {{entirety}} at each show. It {{was the first time}} the group toured in promotion of an album from their back catalogue, rather than a new release. As part of the tour, U2 headlined the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee in June. In rationalising the tour, the Edge cited the 2016 US presidential election and other world events for what he judged to be renewed resonance of The Joshua Trees subject matter. He said that in looking at the record's anniversary, [...] "things have kind of come full circle, if you want. That record was written in the mid-Eighties, during the Reagan–Thatcher era of British and U.S. politics. It was a period when there was a lot of unrest. Thatcher was in the throes of trying to put down the miners' strike; there was all kinds of shenanigans going on in Central America. It feels like we're right back there in a way. I don't think <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> work has ever come full circle to that extent. It just felt like, 'Wow, these songs have a new meaning and a new resonance today that they didn't have three years ago, four years ago.'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Slow Life" [...] {{was written}} in two stages. According to bassist Guto Pryce the [...] "electronic part" [...] was {{composed}} by keyboard player Cian Ciaran [...] "quite a few years" [...] before its eventual release. The band had tried to fit this early, purely electronic, version on previous albums but had [...] "never got 'round to it". By the time the group came to record Phantom Power they were anxious to release the song, however Ciaran was reluctant to leave it in its original form and encouraged {{the rest of the}} band to jam over his original track. According to singer Gruff Rhys the instrumentation was recorded [...] "pretty much live" [...] after which lyrics were written and the band's 10-minute jam session was [...] "chopped ... up and made into a composed song" [...] with the electronic section intact. Strings were later added by Sean O'Hagan. Rhys has stated that renting their own studio in Cardiff has given the band the ability to work on tracks such as [...] "Slow Life" [...] over a period of years—the group visit the studio almost every day and play: [...] "the best parts on <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> records, I think, come out of a couple of us being in our little room in Cardiff at three in the morning, just wigging out and being ecstatic in the music." ...|$|E

500|$|Character shading {{supervisor}} on {{the film}} Thomas Jordan explained that chrome and car paint were the main challenges {{on the film}}, saying: [...] "Chrome and car paint were our two main challenges on this film. We started out by learning {{as much as we}} could. At the local body shop, we watched them paint a car, and we saw the way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats. We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured out that we needed a base paint, which is where the color comes from, and the clearcoat, which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a pearlescent quality the might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone." [...] Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: [...] "Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we’ve seen in <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> previous films. In the past, we’ve mostly used environment maps and other matte-based technology to cheat reflections, but for Cars we added a ray-tracing capability to our existing Renderman program to raise the bar for Pixar." ...|$|E
