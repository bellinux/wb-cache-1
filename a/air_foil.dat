5000|$|Fuselage era Chryslers all {{featured}} a full width loop style chrome front bumper. Quad headlamps and grille were recessed inside the loop, with differing grille inserts for each series. Turn signal and parking lamps were recessed into the bumper below the head lamps. Body sides were simple and smooth with a subtle character line originating {{at the front}} bumper, descending slightly {{for the length of}} the car, and ending at the wrap-around rear bumper. On Town and Country wagons, this character line was also the location of the lower molding surrounding the standard wood grain side paneling, simulated cherry for 1969. The fuselage profile extended the length of a full sized “long roof” made for a rather striking looking wagon.

50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{adaptation}} to flight is the wing, but because flight is so energetically demanding birds have evolved several other adaptations to improve efficiency when flying. Birds' bodies are streamlined to help overcome air-resistance. Also, the bird skeleton is hollow to reduce weight, and many unnecessary bones {{have been lost}} (such as the bony tail of the early bird Archaeopteryx), along with the toothed jaw of early birds, which has been replaced with a lightweight beak. The skeleton's breastbone has also adapted into a large keel, suitable for the attachment of large, powerful flight muscles. The vanes of each feather have hooklets called barbules that zip the vanes of individual feathers together, giving the feathers the strength needed to hold the airfoil (these are often lost in flightless birds). The barbules maintain the shape and function of the feather. Each feather has a major (greater) side and a minor (lesser) side, meaning that the shaft or rachis does not run {{down the center of}} the feather. Rather it runs longitudinally of center with the lesser or minor side to the front and the greater or major side to the rear of the feather. This feather anatomy, during flight and flapping of the wings, causes a rotation of the feather in its follicle. The rotation occurs in the up motion of the wing. The greater side points down, letting air slip through the wing. This essentially breaks the integrity of the wing, allowing for a much easier movement in the up direction. The integrity of the wing is reestablished in the down movement, which allows for part of the lift inherent in bird wings. This function is most important in taking off or achieving lift at very low or slow speeds where the bird is reaching up and grabbing air and pulling itself up. At high speeds the <b>air</b> <b>foil</b> function of the wing provides most of the lift needed to stay in flight.|$|E

Born with an {{identical}} twin, Aharon and family moved to Bnei Brak in 1960. In 1976, Aharon graduated from a local high school and joined the Academic Reserve Unit of the Israeli Air Force, which allows its members to finish their academic degree prior to active duty. Deeply interested in engineering, Aharon applied to the Technion's Department of Aeronautical Engineering to begin his studies. After four years of study, Isser completed his bachelor's degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 1980 and shortly thereafter received the rank of second lieutenant in the Israeli Air Force. During his six years of service in the Israeli Air Force, Isser simultaneously earned his master's degree in Aeronautical Engineering at the Technion. In 1984, during his military service, Isser also married, {{and moved to a}} suburb of Tel Aviv. Soon after, {{he and his wife had}} two children, one, a girl, in 1985 and the other, a boy, in 1989.In 1986 Isser was honorably discharged from the Israeli Air Force, having achieved the rank of captain. He then accepted a position as a senior engineer at Elbit Systems, a military defense contractor located near Haifa, Israel, where he modeled trajectories and flight profiles of missiles launched from a fixed-wing aircraft. While at Elbit, Isser continued his studies at the Technion on a part-time basis under the guidance of Professor Aviv Rosen. In 1995, Isser completed his Ph-D in Aeronautical Engineering and successfully defended his thesis, entitled [...] "The Influence of Variations in the Locations of the Blades of a Hovering Helicopter on the Aerodynamic Loads Developed during Perturbations about Axial Flight".That same year, Isser died on April 9, 1995 in a tragic accident, but his pioneering work in <b>air</b> <b>foil</b> modeling has paved the way for more aerodynamically efficient designs for helicopter rotors and other rotorcraft platforms.|$|E

50|$|Oliver Simmonds {{joined the}} Royal Aircraft Factory on leaving Cambridge University in 1922. During {{his time at}} Farnborough, Simmonds wrote a joint paper with the only female {{engineer}} there {{on the results of}} a test in the Wind Tunnel in which an <b>air</b> <b>foil</b> was exposed to the passage of air at speeds in excess of the speed of sound. Simmonds was then transferred to the Air Worthiness Dept, which was responsible for approving and granting a British Certificate of Airworthiness to each newly designed aircraft. This position required him to visit the design offices of all the British Aircraft designers, where he saw first hand all the new design ideas that were evolving. After the US won the Schneider Trophy in 1924 at a speed of about 240 mph, the British Air Ministry called for a new monoplane challenger that could achieve 300 mph in level flight. In a search for new talent, R.J Mitchell at Supermarine interviewed Simmonds and invited him to join the design team. In the 1960s, while talking to another former Schneider team member, he was reminded how the fuselage diameter of the S5 was determined. Simmonds had asked one of the team to put a piece of plywood vertically against the wall. He then sat on the floor {{with his back to the}} plywood, while a colleague drew a line around his body. This became the fuselage diameter. Simmonds was a small man physically, which is the reason that the RAF pilots chosen to fly the aircraft were of a similar stature. This Supermarine series of aircraft won the Schneider Trophy in 1927, 1929 and 1931, thereby winning it outright. The last of the Series, the S6B was the first aircraft to exceed 400 mph in level flight,over the Solent, on 23 September 1931, piloted by Lt George Stainforth. In the following years under contract to the Air Ministry, Supermarine built a number of fighter prototypes based on the Schneider Cup Series design, eventually producing the superb Spitfire. During Simmonds time with Supermarine, he had begun, in his spare time, working on the design of a new light aircraft, which he later named the Spartan. It had interchangeable wings and interchangeable tail surfaces, a particular advantage in export markets. This resulted in a disagreement between Simmonds and Supermarine and the former announced in July 1928 that he was leaving Supermarine to form his own company to produce the Spartan.|$|E

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>foil</b> {{bearings}} offer {{several advantages}} over oil-lubricated bearings in high speed micro-turbomachinery. With no {{contact between the}} rotor and bearings, the <b>air</b> <b>foil</b> bearings have higher service life and consequently lesser standstills between operations. However, the foil bearings have reliability issues that come from dry rubbing during start-up/shutdown and limited heat dissipation capability. Regardless of lubricating media, the hydrodynamic pressure generated provides only load support but no dissipation of parasitic energy generated by viscous drag and the heat conducted {{from other parts of}} the machine through the rotor. The present study is a continuation of the work on hybrid <b>air</b> <b>foil</b> bearings (HAFB) developed by Kim and Park, where they present a new concept of <b>air</b> <b>foil</b> bearing combining hydrodynamic <b>air</b> <b>foil</b> bearing with hydrostatic lift. Their experimental studies show that HAFB has superior performance compared to its hydrodynamic counterpart in load capacity and cooling performance. In this article, the bearing stiffness and damping coefficients of HAFB are calculated using a linear perturbation method developed for HAFB. The study focuses on circular HAFB with a single continuous top foil supported by bump foil. The research also includes a parametric study which outlines the dependence of the stiffness and damping coefficients on various design parameters like supply pressure (P s), feed parameter (? s), excitation frequency (v), and bearing number (?). Furthermore the present research also includes experimental investigation of HAFB with bump foil as compliant structure.

40|$|Foil {{bearings}} {{are widely}} used for oil-free micro turbomachinery. One of the critical technical issues related to reliability of the foil bearings is a coating wear on the top foil and rotor during start/stops. Bearing cooling is also mandatory for certain applications because the foil bearings can generate significant amount of heat depending on operating conditions. Usually axial flow is used through {{the space between the}} top foil and bearing sleeve. In this thesis, a hybrid <b>air</b> <b>foil</b> bearing with external pressurization is introduced. The hybrid operation eliminates the coating wear during start-up/shut down, and also reduces drag torque during starts. Furthermore, this hybrid foil bearing does not need cooling system. An experimental test with a loaded bearing under hydrostatic mode demonstrates the high potential of hybrid <b>air</b> <b>foil</b> bearings. The load capacity of the hybrid foil bearing was measured at 20, 000 rpm, and compared with that of hydrodynamic foil bearing. The hybrid foil bearing has much higher load capacity than the hydrodynamic foil bearing. The starting torque was also measured and compared with hydrodynamic bearing. A simple analytical model to calculate top foil deflection under hydrostatic pressurization has been developed. Predictions via orbit simulations indicate the hybrid <b>air</b> <b>foil</b> bearings can have a much higher critical speed and onset speed of instability than the hydrodynamic counter part. Major benefits of the hybrid foil bearings also include very low starting torque, reduced wear of the top foil and rotor, and very effective cooling capability by the pressurized air itself. This new concept of hybrid <b>air</b> <b>foil</b> bearings are expected to be widely applied to the oil free turbomachinery industry, especially for heavily loaded and/or high temperature applications...|$|E
