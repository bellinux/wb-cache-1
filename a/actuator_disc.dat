40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} {{two models}} to simulate a wind turbine. This {{is done by}} employing the 1 D momentum <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> theory in PHOENICS, a general purpose computational fluid dynamics software. To test the general applicability of these models, single wind turbine simulations are conducted using eight different wind turbine models from two manufacturers. The simulations are performed by imposing sheared inflow with hub height wind speeds ranging from 3 m/s up to 25 m/s. A range of computational parameters are investigated, including {{the resolution of the}} domain, the thickness of the <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> and the iterative convergence criteria.

Current rotor design models proceed from a disc with a uniform axial velocity, modified by a tip correction like the one of Prandtl-Glauert-Shen. A comparison shows that this correction leads to a similar distribution as obtained from the potential flow solutions. A next comparison is made with the velocity distribution at the blade position of a Joukowsky rotor with constant bound circulation, calculated by an Actuator Line and a Lifting Line model. The resulting distributions correspond reasonably well to the potential flow disc distribution, in magnitude as well as shape.

40|$|The Blade Element Momentum {{theory is}} {{based on the work of}} Glauert who {{formulated}} the equations to derive thrust, torque and power as a function of the tip speed ratio λ and axial induction. The moment of momentum applied to the wake, is taken into account in his theory with one major simplification. The radial pressure distribution required to maintain the swirl in the wake is ignored, and not included in the momentum balance and the final results. For high λ the swirl is negligible so this simplification has no effect, but for low λ this is questionable. After Glauert, many authors have published solutions for the low λ regime of discs with constant circulation, all with different assumptions on the radial distribution of flow quantities, the momentum balance or the impact of the infinite pressure in case of a discrete vortex at the disc axis. A common property of the results is that the power coefficient Cp increases above the Lanchester-Betz-Joukowsky limit.

40|$|Wake {{effects in}} wind farms {{are a major}} source of power {{production}} losses and fatigue loads on the rotors. It has been demonstrated that in large wind farms the only source of kinetic energy to balance that extracted by the turbines is the vertical transport of the free-stream flow kinetic energy from above the wind-turbine canopy. This chapter explores the possibility to enhance such process by introducing tethered kites in steady flight within a small wind-turbine array. In a first step, an array of four wind turbines, aligned with the streamwise velocity component, is simulated within the Large Eddy Simulation framework. The turbines are placed in a pre-generated turbulent atmospheric boundary layer and modelled as <b>actuator</b> <b>discs</b> with both axial and tangential inductions, to account for the wake rotation. The main part of the study considers an identical wind turbine configuration with kites suspended half the inter-turbine spacing distance.

First, the one-dimensional theory of characteristics {{is used to}} derive boundary quantities for the Euler equations and also for their preconditioned version for low-velocities (after Choi and Merkle). A slight adaption of the scalar dissipation is also suggested for strong temperature gradients. Then, after {{the presentation of the}} EC- 145 helicopter configuration, the results of a demonstration computation are presented and commented on. The engine inlet and outlet areas have reached a stable state and exhibit a relatively complex surface flow pattern. It is shown that the plumes of hot gases experience several stretch and distortion phases as they convect downstream from the engine nozzle down to aft the horizontal stabilisers. Also the influence of the downwash of both <b>actuator</b> <b>discs</b> is evidenced in showing how the separation bubble is shifted to the left and how the plume of exhaust gases deforms, thus resulting in only one hot spot on the left horizontal stabiliser instead of one on each side.

40|$|The present {{paper is}} the summary of 3 years of {{research}} on the wake aerodynamics of horizontal axis wind turbine at Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands. In particular, the main results and the conclusions of two experimental campaigns are collected. The underlying research question is: how do the near-wake turbulent flow structures affect the re-energising of the far wake and to what extend is the <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> assumption valid for the representation of the near wake dynamics? In the first experiments, stereo particle image velocimetry is used for analysing the turbulent velocity field in the near and transition wake of a small two-bladed wind turbine model. The results showed the important role of the tip-vortex helix instability (leapfrogging) in the mixing process and in the re-energising of the wake. The tip-vortex instability and breakdown, in fact, give rise to a more efficient turbulent mixing. In the second campaign, the same measurement technique is used for acquiring data in the near wake of the wind turbine model and in the near wake of a porous disc, emulating the numerical <b>actuator</b> <b>disc.</b> The results show a good match velocity fields between wind turbine and <b>actuator</b> <b>disc,</b> but show a different turbulence intensity and turbulent mixing.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a numerical investigation of ducted tidal turbines, employing three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations. Bidirectional ducted turbines are modelled {{with and without}} aperture, referred to as ducted and open- centre turbines respectively. The work consists of two investigations. In the first, the turbine rotors are represented by <b>actuator</b> <b>discs,</b> a simplification which captures changes in linear momentum and thus the primary interaction of the turbine with the flow through and around the duct, while greatly reducing computational complexity. In the second investigation, the turbine rotors are represented through a CFD-integrated blade element momentum model, employing realistic rotor data, capturing swirl and blade drag {{in addition to the}} extraction of linear momentum. Both modelling techniques were employed to investigate the performances of bare, ducted, and open-centre turbines, relating these to the flow fields exhibited. For axial flow, substantial decreases in power generated by the ducted and open-centre turbines were found, relative to a bare turbine of equal total device diameter. For open-centre turbines, an increase in aperture size leads to a further reduction in power generated. Increased blockage was shown to positively affect the performance of all devices. Two further measures of performance were employed: power density, normalising the power by the rotor area, and basin efficiency, relating the power generated to the overall power removed from the flow. Moderate increases in power density can be achieved for the ducted and open-centre devices, while their basin efficiencies are of similar value to that of the bare turbine. For yawed inflow, the performance of the bare turbine decreases, whilst that of the ducted and open-centre turbines increases. This is due to an increased flow velocity following flow acceleration around the inlet lip of the duct and also an increase in effective blockage as ducts present greater projected frontal area when approached non-axially.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a Model Predictive Control Allocation (MPCA) method {{in order to}} coordinate the motion actuators of a heavy vehicle. The presented method merges the strong points of two different control theories: Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Control Allocation (CA); MPC explicitly considers the motion actuators dynamics before deciding on a suitable input for the actuators while CA dynamically decides {{how to use the}} motion actuators in order to modify the vehicle behaviour. The designed MPCA formulation belongs to the class of Quadratic Programming (QP) problems so that the solution is optimization based, i. e. at every step a quadratic cost function has to be minimized while fulfilling a set of linear constraints. Three scenarios were set up {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the controller: split-μ braking, split-μ acceleration and brake blending. Split-μ means that the wheels on one side of the vehicle are in contact with a slippery surface (e. g. ice) while the wheels of the other side lay on a normal surface (e. g. dry asphalt). The split-μ scenarios aim to combine three different types of motion <b>actuators,</b> <b>disc</b> brakes, powertrain and rear active steering (RAS), in order to brake/accelerate the vehicle while keeping it on course. The third scenario is a mild braking event on a normal road and its purpose is to combine the use of the engine brake with the disc brakes. Simulation results of the scenarios have shown promising vehicle performance when using MPCA to coordinate the motion actuators. Tests on a real vehicle have then confirmed the expected vehicle behaviour in a slit-μ braking scenario. MPCA has also been compared to a simpler CA formulation, in all scenarios. The performance of the two is comparable in steady state, but MPCA shows advantages in transients, whereas CA is less computationally demanding...|$|R

This program represents the continuation of the binational CHANCE project, involving the same partners. The objective of the project is to enhance and further validate the CFD tools: the structured multi-block elsA software of Onera and the unstructured TAU code of DLR, for computing the aerodynamics of the complete trimmed helicopter, accounting for the blade elasticity by coupling with blade dynamics and structural mechanics tools. A coupling activity between the FLOWer code of DLR and the HOST tool of Eurocopter is also completed to achieve the free flight trim of a complete helicopter. In this program particular attention is being given to wake conservation, to the modelling of elaborated complex shapes such as rotor hubs and consequently to interactional phenomena, with the global objective of improving the prediction of helicopter performance and noise. Rotorcraft noise prediction chains were rationalized, enhanced and compared.

40|$|The <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> (AD) {{model is}} {{commonly}} used to simplify the simulation of horizontal-axis wind-turbine aerodynamics. The limitations of this approach in reproducing the wake losses in wind farm simulations have been proven by a previous research. The present study is aimed at providing an experimental analysis of the near-wake turbulent flow of a wind turbine (WT) and a porous disc, emulating the <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> numerical model. The general purpose is to highlight the similarities and to quantify the differences of the two models in the near-wake region, characterised by the largest discrepancies. The velocity fields {{in the wake of}} a wind turbine model and a porous disc (emulation of the <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> numerical model) have been measured in a wind tunnel using stereo particle image velocimetry. The study has been conducted at low turbulence intensity in order to separate the problems of the flow mixing caused by the external turbulence and the one caused by the turbulence induced directly by the AD or the WT presence. The analysis, as such, showed the intrinsic differences and similarities between the flows in the two wakes, solely due to the wake-induced flow, with no influence of external flow fluctuations. The data analysis provided the time-average three-component velocity and turbulence intensity fields, pressure fields, rotor and disc loading, vorticity fields, stagnation enthalpy distribution, and mean-flow kinetic-energy fluxes in the shear layer at the border of the wake. The properties have been compared in the wakes of the two models. Even in the absence of turbulence, the results show a good match in the thrust and energy coefficient, velocity, pressure, and enthalpy fields between wind turbine and <b>actuator</b> <b>disc.</b> However, the results show a different turbulence intensity and turbulent mixing.

40|$|The {{helicopter}} project CHANCE contains, {{among other}} developments, the quasi-steady approximation to modelling rotors with actuator discs. This reduces {{the cost of}} an unsteady simulation down to a stationary one. In testing existing approaches in the literature, the source term implementation proved to perform best especially in forward flight: source terms located on the disc bottom side impart impulse and energy to the fluid. These are obtained from a loose coupling between two DLR codes: the flow solver FLOWer and the rotor code S 4. The latter provides a rotor map, a radial and azimuthal force distribution, to the former converting it to the <b>actuator</b> <b>disc</b> map (source terms).

40|$|The {{friction}} drag reduction in a turbulent channel flow generated by surface-mounted rotating <b>disc</b> <b>actuators</b> is investigated numerically. The wall {{arrangement of the}} discs has a complex and unexpected effect on the flow. For low disc-tip velocities, the drag reduction scales linearly with {{the percentage of the}} actuated area, whereas for higher disc-tip velocity the drag reduction can be larger than the prediction found through the linear scaling with actuated area. For medium disc-tip velocities, all the cases which display this additional drag reduction exhibit stationary-wall regions between discs along the streamwise direction. This effect is caused by the viscous boundary layer which develops over the portions of stationary wall due to the radial flow produced by the discs. For the highest disc-tip velocity, the drag reduction even increases by halving the number of discs. The power spent to activate the discs is instead independent of the disc arrangement and scales linearly with the actuated area for all disc-tip velocities. The Fukagata-Iwamoto-Kasagi identity and flow visualizations are employed to provide further insight into the dynamics of the streamwise-elongated structures appearing between discs. Sufficient interaction between adjacent discs along the spanwise direction must occur for the structures to be created at the disc side where the wall velocity is directed in the opposite direction to the streamwise mean flow. Novel half-disc and annular actuators are investigated to improve the disc-flow performance, resulting in a maximum of 26 % drag reduction.

40|$|Piezoelectric {{ceramics}} {{materials are}} extensively {{used in many}} electro mechanical systems as sensing and actuating devices. The performance of these devices deteriorates due to cyclic loading either mechanical, electrical, electromechanical, thermo-mechanical, and under thermal shocking conditions. Earlier the effect of electrical and mechanical cycling oadings on the functional performance has been investigated. The properties of commercial lead zirconate titanatedegrade during such cycling. However degradation phenomenon of piezoelectric material during thermal shocking is still an area which has to be explored. The decay in functional properties of materials is somewhat called degradation and this terminology {{used to describe the}} loss in performance with time due to stress and temperature. The common phenomenon of degradation is aging of the material, which affects the performance of the material with time. This change in performance is thought to be due to re-orientation of dipoles in different configurations. Environment is another degradation phenomenon influence the performance of piezo devices. Output performance of piezoelectric materials changes frequently with the change in temperature, pressure, humidity and moisture. Recently many studies show that water has the profound effect on the performance of piezoelectric materials. Reliability of these smart materials is important and hence there is a requirement to have an extensive study on its functional performance and properties. In <b>actuators</b> mostly <b>disc</b> shaped piezoelectric are used due to their improved properties. A part of this particular research work was to investigate the degradation of thin lead zirconate titanate piezoelectric discs through a series of experimentation to observe its function at variable frequencies in simple tap water, de-ionized water and sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions. Output performance has been monitored in real time as peak-peak voltage change. PZT disc found sensitive in performance in various solutions at different frequencies. The results obtained can be utilized as qualitative data for designing of micro electro mechanical systems The change in capacitance has been measured by using relevant instrumentation during thermal shocking in de- ionized water. The change in capacitance is a measure of dielectric constant and other piezoelectric properties. Dielectric constant, impedance, tangent loss and dissipation factors are the required parameters and can bemeasured by using suitable size and shape of piezoelectric materials. In general, piezoelectric ceramics posses the largest electromechanical coupling factor, dielectric constant and lowest dielectric loss. The sudden change in temperature may experience a thermal stress which further changes its above stated properties. Most of the properties are attributed to change in capacitance values at resonance and anti resonance frequencies. In a part of this research work, focus was to determine the various piezoelectric properties by thermal shocking in de-ionized water at resonance frequencies. In another phase piezoelectric ceramics disc has been investigated for its sensitivity at different temperatures and at different frequencies and resistances. A model has been developed to indicate the effect of resistance band at different temperatures. The model of performance characteristics of thin PZT disc under different temperature conditions is a unique finding and may used in selection of particular frequency and resistance range for many piezo devices for the stated conditions The objective of this research work was to explore the degradation of thin PZT piezoelectric ceramics disc in its performance and change of various piezoelectric properties during thermal cycling and shocking. The present work uncovers thevarious unattended thermal cycling and shocking condition of stated piezoelectric material. Comprehensive data obtained by real time experimentation may useful for designing of various micro-electromechanical systems...|$|R
