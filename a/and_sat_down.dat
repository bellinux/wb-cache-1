5|$|In the {{build up}} to the World Cup Charlton gave out first caps to Gary Kelly, Phil Babb and Jason McAteer; he had {{difficulty}} convincing McAteer to join Ireland as he first had to turn down an approach by the FA {{to play for the}} England under-21s. He scheduled difficult matches before the tournament and Ireland picked up positive results by beating both the Netherlands and Germany away from home. Ireland opened the group stage of the tournament by beating Italy 1–0 at the Giants Stadium, Ray Houghton scoring the winning goal on 11 minutes. They then fell to a 2–1 defeat to Mexico at the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium, during which Charlton had a pitch-side argument with an official who was preventing substitute John Aldridge (who went on to score the consolation goal) from taking the pitch minutes after his teammate Tommy Coyne had left the pitch <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> on the bench. For his arguing, Charlton was suspended by FIFA for the final group game against Norway, and had to watch from the commentary box as Ireland qualified with a 0–0 draw. They faced the Netherlands in the Round of 16; Dennis Bergkamp put the Dutch ahead on 11 minutes after Marc Overmars took advantage of a mistake by Terry Phelan, and Wim Jonk scored the second and final goal of the game from 30 yards after Packie Bonner fluffed an otherwise routine save. For his achievements Charlton was awarded the Freedom of the City of Dublin in 1994 by Lord Mayor Tomás Mac Giolla, the first Englishman to be given the honour since 1854.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} they got to the beach, Kalaniʻōpuʻu's two {{youngest}} sons, who had been following their father believing they were being invited to visit the ship again with the ruler, began to climb into the boats that were waiting at the shore. Kānekapōlei shouted to them {{to get out of the}} boat and pleaded with her husband to stop. The ruler then realized that Cook and his men were not asking him to visit the ship, but forcing him. At this point he stopped <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E

25|$|Ord was {{reportedly}} {{the first officer}} {{to reach the top}} and began directing supporting fire when he was hit in the throat, mortally wounded. He dropped his pistol and sword <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> grasping his neck. Corporal Walker of D Troop killed his officer's assailant, then tried to help Ord. Walker stated that Ord had made a statement before he bled to death. The essence was that if the 10th had not been separated by the draw between the two hills, they would have taken the heights already. Ord was then buried on the hill.|$|E
25|$|Using his {{friendly}} {{relations with}} the British, Kâmil Pasha also sat down to end the ongoing First Balkan War diplomatically. However, the heavy Ottoman military upsets during the war continued to sap morale, as rumors that the capital {{would have to be}} moved from Istanbul to inland Anatolia spread. The Bulgarian Army had soon advanced as far as Çatalca, a western district of modern Istanbul. At this point, Kâmil Pasha's government signed an armistice with Bulgaria in December 1912 <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to draw up a treaty {{for the end of the}} war at the London Peace Conference.|$|E
25|$|On May 30, {{more than}} 500 monks {{demonstrated}} {{in front of}} the National Assembly in Saigon. The Buddhists had evaded a ban on public assembly by hiring four buses and filling up and pulling the blinds down. They drove around the city before the convoy stopped at the designated time and the monks disembarked. This {{was the first time that}} an open protest had been held in Saigon against Diệm in his eight years of rule. They unfurled banners <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> for four hours before disbanding and returning to the pagodas to begin a nationwide 48-hour hunger strike organised by the Buddhist patriarch Thich Tinh Khiet.|$|E

25|$|In 1939, Tucker {{organized}} a sit-in at Alexandria Library, which refused to issue library cards to black residents. On August 21, five {{young black men}} whom Tucker had recruited and instructed – William Evans, Otto L. Tucker, Edward Gaddis, Morris Murray, and Clarence Strange – entered the library one by one, requested applications for library cards and, when refused, each one took a book off the shelf <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> in the reading room until they were removed by the police. Tucker had instructed the men to dress well, speak politely and offer no resistance to the police so as to minimize the chance of the men being found guilty of disorderly conduct or resisting arrest. Tucker defended {{the men in the}} ensuing legal actions, which resulted in the disorderly conduct charges against the protestors being dropped by city attorney Armistead Boothe (who would later become a key figure in desegregating Virginia schools), and in a branch library being established for blacks.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} they handed the {{scapegoat}} {{over to him}} who was to lead it away. All were permitted to lead it away, but the Priests made it a rule not to permit an ordinary Israelite to lead it away. Rabbi Jose said that Arsela of Sepphoris once led it away, although {{he was not a}} priest. The people went with him from booth to booth, except the last one. The escorts would not go with him up to the precipice, but watched from a distance. The one leading the scapegoat divided the thread of crimson wool, and tied one half to the rock, the other half between the scapegoat horns, and pushed the scapegoat from behind. And it went rolling down and before it had reached half its way down the hill, it was dashed to pieces. He came back <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> under the last booth until it grew dark. His garments unclean become unclean from the moment that he has gone outside the wall of Jerusalem, although Rabbi Simeon taught that they became unclean from the moment that he pushed it over the precipice.|$|E
25|$|The fourth-day of {{the battle}} was noted for the valour shown by Bhima. Bhishma {{commanded}} the Kaurava army to move on the offensive from the outset. While Abhimanyu {{was still in his}} mother's womb, Arjuna had taught Abhimanyu on how to break and enter the chakra vyuha. But, before explaining how to exit the chakra Vyuha, Arjuna was interrupted by Krishna (other story: Abhimanyu's mother falls asleep while Arjuna was explaining her). Thus from birth, Abhimanyu only knew how to enter the Chakra vyuha but didn't know how to come out of it. When the Kauravas formed the chakravyuha, Abhimanyu entered it but was surrounded and attacked by a number of Kaurava princes. Arjuna joined the fray in aid of Abhimanyu. Bhima appeared on the scene with his mace aloft and started attacking the Kauravas. Duryodhana sent a huge force of elephants at Bhima. When Bhima saw the mass of elephants approaching, he got down from his chariot and attacked them single-handedly with his iron mace. They scattered and stampeded into the Kaurava forces killing many. Duryodhana ordered an all-out attack on Bhima. Bhima withstood all that was thrown at him and attacked Duryodhana's brothers, killing eight of them. Bhima was soon struck by an arrow on the chest <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> in his chariot dazed.|$|E

500|$|Moss 3 {{was set up}} to be an {{unexpected}} mass, nonviolent, sit down strike within the preparation plant. [...] The 99 strikers walked into the plant peacefully <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> inside the plant to halt production. Meanwhile, thousands of other supporters gathered outside the plant to encourage the strikers inside – an estimated 5,000 supporters at the height of Moss 3 were gathered outside the production plant.|$|E
500|$|When he {{returned}} to New York, Adams met with Maurice Daly, then the [...] "dean of billiards". Daly listened to Adams' story, {{and said that he}} was not aware that any startling shots could be accomplished using only the hands. Daly offered Adams a set of four balls, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to watch Adams. After 12 shots, Daly became greatly interested, often asking Adams to repeat shots. At the end of the performance, Daly told Adams that if he ever entertained any idea of entering the billiards field he would give Adams an engagement at his room.|$|E
500|$|Alf {{first saw}} Julia Stanley at the 'Trocadero' club, a {{converted}} cinema on Camden Road, Liverpool. Although {{he did not}} speak {{to her at the}} time, he later saw Julia again in Sefton Park, where he had gone with a friend to meet girls. Alf, who was dressed in a bowler hat and holding a cigarette holder, saw [...] "this little waif" [...] sitting on a wrought-iron bench. The 14-year-old Julia said that his hat looked [...] "silly", to which the 15-year-old replied that Julia looked [...] "lovely", <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> next to her. Julia asked him to take off his hat, so he promptly took it off and threw it straight into the lake.|$|E

500|$|On June 1, 1995, Abu-Jamal's {{death warrant}} {{was signed by}} Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge. Its {{execution}} was suspended while Abu-Jamal pursued state post-conviction review. At the post-conviction review hearings, new witnesses were called. William [...] "Dales" [...] Singletary testified that he saw the shooting and that the gunman was the passenger in Cook's car. Singletary's account contained discrepancies which rendered it [...] "not credible" [...] {{in the opinion of}} the court. William Harmon, a convicted fraudster, testified that Faulkner's murderer fled in a car that pulled up to the crime scene, and could not have been Abu-Jamal. Robert Harkins testified that he had witnessed a man stand over Faulkner as the latter lay wounded on the ground, who shot him point-blank in the face and then [...] "walked <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> on the curb".|$|E
500|$|In the Sticky & Sweet Tour, [...] "Miles Away" [...] was {{performed}} during the gypsy {{segment of the}} show. Madonna wore a gypsy inspired Givenchy long cape, over a black dress, with pink colored ribbons around her neck. She also wore black stockings on her leg. Before starting the song she said, [...] "This is for all who know the struggle of long-distance relationships. I know you're out there." [...] While dancers gathered <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{in a circle around}} her, Madonna went up on a platform, started playing the acoustic guitar and encouraged the crowd to clap and sing along. The screens give another message to the song, showing a stream of world maps and passport stamps and the history as well as journey of gypsies travelling around the world, adding to the atmosphere of that particular section of the show.|$|E
500|$|Labyrinth {{was being}} seriously {{discussed}} {{as early as}} March 1983, when Henson held a meeting with Froud and children's author Dennis Lee. Lee was tasked with writing a novella on which a script could be based, submitting {{it at the end}} of 1983. Henson approached Terry Jones to write the film's script as [...] "his daughter Lisa had just read Erik the Viking and suggested that he try me as screen-writer." [...] Jones was given Dennis Lee's novella to use as a basis for his script, but later told Empire that Lee had produced an unfinished [...] "poetic novella" [...] that he [...] "didn't really get on with." [...] In light of this, Jones [...] "discarded it <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> with Brian 's drawings and sifted through them and found the ones that I really liked, and started creating the story from them." ...|$|E

500|$|Alfred 'Freddie' Lennon—always called 'Alf' by his family—was always joking {{but never}} held {{a job for}} very long, preferring to visit Liverpool's many {{vaudeville}} theatres and cinemas, where he knew the usherettes by name. At the Trocadero club, a converted cinema on Camden Road, Liverpool, he first saw an [...] "auburn-haired girl with a bright smile and high cheekbones"; Julia Stanley. [...] He saw her again in Sefton Park, where he had gone with a friend to meet girls. Lennon, who {{was dressed in a}} bowler hat and with a cigarette holder in hand, saw [...] "this little waif" [...] sitting on a wrought-iron bench. Julia (14 years old) said that his hat looked [...] "silly", to which the 15-year-old Alf replied that she looked [...] "lovely", <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> next to her. She asked him to take off his hat, so he promptly threw it straight into the Sefton Park lake.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{explained}} that the Beatles had only experienced sex with girls from Liverpool, but {{when they got to}} Hamburg the only women who hung around the clubs late at night were strippers, dancers, or prostitutes. Harrison (who was then only 17) called Hamburg [...] "the naughtiest city in the world". McCartney said: [...] "By the time you got to Hamburg, a girlfriend there was likely to be a stripper, so to be suddenly involved with a hard-core striptease artist, who obviously knew {{a thing or two about}} sex... it was quite an eye-opener." [...] Gerry Marsden—frontman for Gerry & the Pacemakers—remembered visiting a Hamburg brothel in Herbertstrasse with Lennon: [...] "We paid our money, went in <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down.</b> This guy came out with the biggest lady we had ever seen in our lives. She looked like a bus with a bra on. We ran out that door so quick we didn't hear it shut. I wanted to go back to get my money back but John said: 'No, we'd better not. Might cause trouble.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Rhimes also {{described}} the difficulty she faced in finding an appropriate love {{interest for the}} character of Alex Karev: [...] "We kept meeting with people and it wasn't until we met Elizabeth Reaser <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> with her, and in two seconds in {{realized that she was}} absolutely the one we'd been looking for." [...] Reaser explained that when she was cast, there were no definite plans for the development of her character, and that only the intrigue of the ferry accident had been explained to her. She also deemed her character [...] "frustrated and scared". As for the make up process, Reaser stated: [...] "The prosthetic changes your outlook on yourself. It can be very disorienting. It's intense." [...] Beers, however, noted that the focus on Ava was mainly due to her inability to express her feelings through facial expressions, only communicating with her eyes and voice. Executive producer Rob Corn stated that his plan for the original arc was about Jane Doe's inner life, struggling {{to get out of the}} situation she is trapped in. He stated that the main characteristics they had been looking for in the actress for the part were strength and vulnerability. He also called Reaser's performance [...] "heart-wrenching and wonderful". Betsy Beers, the show's supervising executive producer, found Izzie to have been marked for life by Denny's death, which matured her [...] "in a very sobering way", but played a major role in making her feel more confident. She also noted the undeniable connection between Izzie and Alex Karev, whose desire to do honorable things has been compared with his [...] "cutting and sarcastic" [...] personality. After Izzie's continuous efforts to change Alex during their relationship in the previous season, Beers announced the possibility of a relationship between the two of them. She also contrasted the female leads on the show with women in film, explaining how the characters on television are shaped in unique ways.|$|E
