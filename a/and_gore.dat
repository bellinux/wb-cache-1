Other ratings were released later from the BBFC and the ACB, which gave Saw an 18+ and a MA15+ rating respectively.|$|E

5|$|On October 26, 1996, a {{well-known}} gaming clan, the Rangers, surprised the Quake community with Diary of a Camper, the first widely known machinima film. This short, 100-second demo file contained the action <b>and</b> <b>gore</b> of many others, {{but in the}} context of a brief story, rather than the usual deathmatch. An example of transformative or emergent gameplay, this shift from competition to theater required both expertise in and subversion of the game's mechanics. The Ranger demo emphasized this transformation by retaining specific gameplay references in its story.|$|E
5|$|The DVD and VHS {{editions of}} the film were {{released}} December 1, 2003 in the UK and December 2, 2003 in the US, with 11 million copies sold in the first week, a record for live action video. It earned $235,300,000 from DVDs as of January 2004. The DVD featured two discs, featuring three commentary tracks (Johnny Depp <b>and</b> <b>Gore</b> Verbinski; Jerry Bruckheimer, Keira Knightley and Jack Davenport; and the screenwriter team), various deleted scenes and documentaries, and a 1968 Disneyland episode about the theme park ride. A special three-disc edition was released in November 2, 2004 in the US and April 25, 2005 in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Rare took greater liberties with {{violence}} <b>and</b> <b>gore</b> in Battletoads Arcade since {{the product was}} not destined for home consoles. It was Rare's first game to use the 3D graphics technology later popularized in Donkey Kong Country and Killer Instinct. Although the game playtested well {{and appeared to be}} financially viable, the publisher hesitated to release it. The game proved unsuccessful in the arcades and its in-production Super NES port was canceled. Retrospective reviews were more positive--Retro Gamer even declared it the best of the series. Battletoads Arcade received its console debut when it was emulated in the 2015 Rare Replay, a compilation of games from Rare's history for the Xbox One. Rare Replay reviewers were surprised by the quality of the arcade game and some considered it a highlight of the package. Battletoads Arcade remains the last entry in the Battletoads series.|$|E

5|$|The Bank of the United States was {{established}} by Alexander Hamilton to provide stable banking services on a national scale, and sought to open a branch in Boston. Hamilton recruited heavily in the Bank of Massachusetts, <b>and</b> <b>Gore</b> {{decided to make the}} move. He sold his shares in the Massachusetts bank, and became a director of the Boston branch of the U.S. Bank. He also purchased 200 shares in the new bank, a relatively large investment. Gore was influential in making hiring decisions for the branch, and sought to merge state-chartered banks into the organization, arguing that only a nationally chartered bank could provide consistent and stable service. Gore resigned from the board in 1794, citing the demands of his law practice.|$|E
5|$|The routing of US-64 was {{modified}} further on July 6, 1965, {{through the city}} of Enid. The routing of US-64 Bypass, which was designated two years earlier, was replaced by that of US-64 itself, and {{what used to be}} US-64 became part of a new business loop (US-64 Bus.) through the city. The Oklahoma Department of Highways approved a rerouting of the designation onto a freeway south of Muskogee on October 3, 1966, and a relocation slightly to the north between Jamesville and Muskogee on July 10, 1967. However, neither of these modifications was completed until around 1969. Then, on June 1, 1970, US-64 was relocated across the Arkansas River between Webber Falls <b>and</b> <b>Gore.</b> Between then and 1972, US-64 was realigned between Enid and Perry, with the old highway becoming SH-164.|$|E

Unlike the previous installments that received a T rating, Tomb Raider is the first game in the series to receive an M rating by the ESRB, due to blood <b>and</b> <b>gore,</b> intense violence and strong language.|$|E

50|$|Disputes often arise {{regarding}} {{the ownership of}} gaps <b>and</b> <b>gores</b> when they are discovered, usually when developers detect sufficient value in the local land. Local laws will determine whether they are considered abandoned or rather adhere to (or may be absorbed by) one adjacent parcel or another. For example, in Tennessee law, tax map boundaries can become property boundaries (notwithstanding a survey and deed to the contrary) merely by paying the taxes on the land for twenty years {{in the belief that}} {{it was part of the}} ownership, even if it encompasses adjacent gaps <b>and</b> <b>gores.</b> See adverse possession.|$|R

5|$|In 2005, Resident Evil 4 {{attempted}} {{to redefine the}} genre by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming, broadening the gameplay with elements from the wider action genre. Its ambitions paid off, earning the title several Game of the Year awards for 2005, and the top rank on IGN's Readers' Picks Top 99 Games list. However, this also led some reviewers {{to suggest that the}} Resident Evil series had abandoned the survival horror genre, by demolishing the genre conventions that it had established. Other major survival horror series followed suit by developing their combat systems to feature more action, such as Silent Hill Homecoming, and the 2008 version of Alone in the Dark. These changes were part of an overall trend among console games to shift towards visceral action gameplay. These changes in gameplay have led some purists to suggest that the genre has deteriorated into the conventions of other action games. Jim Sterling suggests that the genre lost its core gameplay when it improved the combat interface, thus shifting the gameplay away from hiding and running towards direct combat. Leigh Alexander argues that this represents a shift towards more Western horror aesthetics, which emphasize action <b>and</b> <b>gore</b> rather than the psychological experience of Japanese horror.|$|E
