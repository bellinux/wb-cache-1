40|$|Pressure locked {{gratings}} {{have many}} uses, both {{on land and}} at sea. This is mainly due to {{the high degree of}} flexibility in dimensions and load bearing capacity. Despite the many uses in our surroundings, the term pressure locked grating is unknown to many. This term refers {{to the way in which}} the most important connection in pressure locked gratings is manufactured. Pressure locked gratings are galvanized and/or coated to prevent corrosion, galvanization is almost always used. This thesis is primarily focused on the behavior of galvanized pressure locked gratings. A pressure locked grating is made up of three type of bars: load <b>bearing</b> <b>bars,</b> cross bars and support bars. The connections between the load <b>bearing</b> <b>bars</b> and the cross bars are realized by pressing the cross bar into premade notch in the load <b>bearing</b> <b>bar.</b> The bars will deform plastically, which results in a connection based only on friction. This connection is called a pressure locked connection. The load <b>bearing</b> <b>bars</b> serve primarily for load transfer in one direction. The pressure locked connection weakens the load <b>bearing</b> <b>bars.</b> The cross bars redistribute a local load over the load <b>bearing</b> <b>bars</b> outside of the loading area and reduce the buckling length of the individual load <b>bearing</b> <b>bar.</b> The support bars are spot-welded to both the load <b>bearing</b> and cross <b>bars.</b> Pressure locked gratings are calculated according to RAL-GZ- 638, a standard published by the Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung e. V. In this standard, pressure locked gratings are calculated on the basis of linear elasticity theory. A calculation according to the EN 1993 - 1 - 1 is not possible because it is not suited for pressure locked gratings. The main objective of this thesis is to determine if a calculation based on the plasticity theory is possible for pressure locked gratings. Through the application of this theory the design strength can be greatly increased, which has a large economic potential. This research is divided up into four parts that are stated below. 9 ̆ 5 Analytical study 9 ̆ 5 Experimental study 9 ̆ 5 FEM validation 9 ̆ 5 Parametric study The vast diversity in size and properties and the complex functioning of the pressure locked connection make pressure locked gratings a difficult product to research. The pressure locked connection also has a big influence on the strength and stiffness. In this galvanizing has a big influence. The analytical study shows that pressure locked gratings fail through: local lateral torsional buckling of one of the load <b>bearing</b> <b>bars,</b> global lateral torsional buckling for the entire pressure locked grating or by a mechanism due to a plastic hinge in de load <b>bearing</b> <b>bars.</b> To research the behavior, numerical models were developed in the FEM-package ABAQUS. To determine the accuracy of these models, experiments were carried out on a number of pressure locked grating geometries. The results of the tests were compared with FEM simulations which made it possible to validate the FEM-models. The validation has taken place on the basis of four test series. Three test series focused on failure mechanisms, namely: collapse due to a mechanism as a result of plastic hinges in the load <b>bearing</b> <b>bars,</b> test series 1 A, collapse due to local lateral torsional buckling, test series 2 A and collapse due to global lateral torsional buckling of the entire pressure locked grating, test series 2 B. The last test series, test series 1 B, is aimed at examining the structural behavior of a common used pressure locked grating. After this validation it is possible to make FEM-models for a large number of different geometries. The behavior of these geometries can then be analyzed. The validation shows that failure mode and failure load are correctly determined by the FEM models. There is however a notable difference between the stiffness of the FEM-model and the stiffness of the test specimens. This difference is likely the result of the influence of the pressure locked connection between the load <b>bearing</b> and cross <b>bars.</b> The research shows that all aforementioned failure modes play a role depending on the dimensions of load <b>bearing</b> <b>bars</b> and cross bars. For relatively thick-set load <b>bearing</b> <b>bars</b> pressure locked gratings fail due to a mechanism as the result of plastic hinges in the load <b>bearing</b> <b>bars.</b> For slender load <b>bearing</b> <b>bars</b> pressure locked gratings fail as a result of instabilities. With the aid of FEM models, it is possible to estimate the extent in which the plastic capacity is present in actually produced pressure locked gratings. This analysis shows that in 72...|$|R
