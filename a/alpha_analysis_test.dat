40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} Critical Success Factors (CSF) needed for effective material recovery through Design for Deconstruction (DfD). The research approach employed in this paper is based on a sequential exploratory mixed method strategy. After a thorough review of literature and conducting four Focus Group Discussion (FGDs), 43 DfD factors were identified and put together in a questionnaire survey. Data analyses include Cronbach’s <b>alpha</b> reliability <b>analysis,</b> mean <b>testing</b> using significance index, and exploratory factor analysis. The result of the factor analysis reveals that an underlying factor structure of five DfD factors groups that include ‘stringent legislation and policy’, ‘deconstruction design process and competencies’, ‘design for material recovery’, ‘design for material reuse’, and ‘design for building flexibility’. These groups of DfD factor groups show that the requirements for DfD goes beyond technical competencies and that non-technical factors such as stringent legislation and policy and design process and competency for deconstruction are key in designing deconstructable buildings. Paying attention to the factors identified in all of these categories will help to tackle impediments that could hinder the effectiveness of DfD. The results of this study would help design and project managers to understand areas of possible improvement in employing DfD as a strategy for diverting waste from landfills...|$|R

40|$|AUTORAMP, {{designed}} and {{developed at the}} Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML), is a completely automatic, field deployable system that performs sampling and gamma-ray spectrometry analyses of filter cartridges. However, for certain measurement applications such as airborne plutonium, gamma-ray analysis alone does not suffice. Plutonium cannot be detected by gamma-ray analysis, but is detectable with <b>alpha</b> <b>analysis.</b> This paper describes the initial research towards giving the AUTORAMP the dual capability of both alpha and gamma measurements. Because of the geometry used in the AUTORAMP cartridge, the only compatible <b>alpha</b> <b>analysis</b> involves the measurement of the ionization produced by an alpha particle as its energy is adsorbed in air. Although this type of alpha measurement has been done before, the associated technology is difficult and requires many of the techniques used in the measurement of currents at the fempto-amp (10 - 15) level. Fortunately, EML pioneered MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor) technology at currents in the atto-amp (10 - 18) region, and is, therefore, uniquely qualified for this research. The paper presents the results obtained from the initial chambers and electronic circuits for gross alpha counting and for <b>alpha</b> spectrometry <b>analysis.</b> The techniques employed to eliminate noise are presented, as is {{the design of the}} proposed chamber to accommodate the filter cartridge and a study to shift the frequency spectrum of the collected ionization pulses away from the noise...|$|R

40|$|Past nuclear accidents, such as Chernobyl, {{resulted}} in a large release of radionuclides into the atmosphere. Radiological assessment of {{the vicinity of the}} site of the incident is vital to assess the exposure levels and dose received by the population and workers. Therefore, it is critical to thoroughly understand the situation and risks associated with a particular event in a timely manner in order to properly manage the event. Current atmospheric radiological assessments of alpha emitting radioisotopes include acquiring large quantities of air samples, chemical separation of radionuclides, sample mounting, counting through <b>alpha</b> spectrometry, and <b>analysis</b> of the data. The existing methodology is effective, but time consuming and labor intensive. Autoradiography, and the properties of phosphor imaging films, may be used as an additional technique to facilitate and expedite the <b>alpha</b> <b>analysis</b> process in these types of situations. Although autoradiography is not as sensitive to alpha radiation as alpha spectrometry, autoradiography may benefit <b>alpha</b> <b>analysis</b> by providing information about the activity as well as the spatial distribution of radioactivity in the sample under investigation. The objective for this research was to develop an efficient method for quantification and visualization of air filter samples taken {{in the aftermath of a}} nuclear emergency through autoradiography using 241 Am and 239 Pu tracers. Samples containing varying activities of either 241 Am or 239 Pu tracers were produced through microprecipitation and assayed by alpha spectroscopy. The samples were subsequently imaged and an activity calibration curve was produced by comparing the digital light units recorded from the image to the known activity of the source. The usefulness of different phosphor screens was examined by exposing each type of film to the same standard nuclide for varying quantities of time. Unknown activity samples created through microprecipiation containing activities of either 241 Am or 239 Pu as well as air filters doped with beta and alpha emitting nuclides were imaged and activities were determined by comparing the image to the activity calibration curve...|$|R
