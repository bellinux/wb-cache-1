5|$|Frog {{mutations}} {{and genetic}} defects have increased since the 1990s. These often include missing legs or extra legs. Various causes {{have been identified}} or hypothesized, including an increase in ultraviolet radiation affecting the spawn {{on the surface of}} ponds, chemical contamination from pesticides and fertilizers, and parasites such as the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae. Probably <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> involved in a complex way as stressors, environmental factors contributing to rates of disease, and vulnerability to attack by parasites. Malformations impair mobility and the individuals may not survive to adulthood. An {{increase in the number of}} frogs eaten by birds may actually increase the likelihood of parasitism of other frogs, because the trematode's complex lifecycle includes the ramshorn snail and several intermediate hosts such as birds.|$|E

25|$|Another {{generalization}} is the finitely additive measure, {{which are}} sometimes called contents. This {{is the same}} as a measure except that instead of requiring countable additivity we require only finite additivity. Historically, this definition was used first.

25|$|The Abay {{has many}} tributaries. Of these, the Bashilo rises near Magdala and drains eastern Amhara; the Jamma rises near Ankober and drains {{northern}} Shoa; the Muger rises near Addis Ababa and drains south-western Shoa; the Didessa, {{the largest of}} the Abay's affluents, rises in the Kaffa hills and has a generally south-to-north course; the Dabus runs near {{the western edge of the}} plateau escarpment. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> perennial rivers. The right-hand tributaries, rising mostly on the western sides of the plateau, have steep slopes and are generally torrential in character. The Beles, however, is perennial, and the Rahad and Dinder are important rivers in flood-time.|$|E
25|$|While {{nothing is}} known about the use of {{tortoise}} shells as money, gold and cowries (either real shells or replicas) were used to the south of the Yellow River. Although {{there is no doubt that}} the well-known spade and knife money were used as coins, it has not been demonstrated that other items often offered by dealers as coins such as fish, halberds, and metal chimes were also used as coins. They are not found in coin hoards, and the probability is that <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> in fact funerary items. Archaeological evidence shows that the earliest use of the spade and knife money was in the Spring and Autumn period (770–476 BCE). As in ancient Greece, socio-economic conditions at the time were favourable to the adoption of coinage.|$|E

25|$|Dutch is the {{official}} language of the Flemish Community and the Flemish Region (merged to Flanders) and, along with French, an official language of the Brussels-Capital Region. The main Dutch dialects spoken in Belgium are Brabantian, West Flemish, East Flemish and Limburgish. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> spoken {{across the border in}} the Netherlands as well, and West Flemish is also spoken in French Flanders. Some sub-dialects may be quite distant from standard Dutch and not be readily intelligible for other Dutch-speakers. Words which are unique to Belgian Dutch are called belgicisms (as are words used primarily in Belgian French). The original Brabantian dialect of Brussels has been very much influenced by French. It is now spoken by a minority in the Capital region since the language of most inhabitants shifted during the Frenchification of Brussels.|$|E
25|$|The acts then {{state that}} Thomas {{converted}} {{the wife of}} King Misdeus, Queen Tertia, and Princess Mygdonia wife of Charisius, Prince Juzanes and Cyphorus, who was ordained as Deacon. The infuriated King Misdaes ordered four soldiers to take Saint Thomas to a hill in his Persian kingdom and spear him. Thomas's remains were moved to Edessa, Mesopotamia. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> Greco-Persian, not ancient Tamil names. Bardesan never mentioned Brahmins as the killers of Saint Thomas; this tradition is Portuguese. Syrian Christians appeared in Madras only when it became an important outpost of the Delhi Sultanate in the 13th century. Ancient Tamils of Chola Dynasty and Pandyan Kingdoms never knew Syrian Christians. Tharisapalli plates issued by King Aiyanadikal Thiruvadikal of the Ay kingdom in 825 AD was the first Tamil to record the existence of Persian immigrant Christians who had signed in Pahlavi, Kufic and Hebrew. These were Nestorian Christians known locally as Nasrani Mappillas, as they married local women. Nestorian Syrians came from the Iraqi cities Baghdad and Karbala in Arab ships in the middle ages.|$|E
25|$|Already in the mid-16th century {{there was}} the odd example of {{importing}} refined Renaissance architecture principles to Finland. Duke John of Finland (later King John III of Sweden) (1537–92) built refined Renaissance interiors in the otherwise medieval Turku Castle. However, during the 17th century Sweden became a major political power in Europe, extending its territory into present day Estonia, Russia and Poland - and this expansiveness was reflected in its architecture over the next century. These architectural ambitions were realised in Finland, too, and markedly in the founding of new towns. Four new towns were founded along the Gulf of Bothnia {{on the west coast}} of Finland during the reign of Gustavus II Adolphus: Nystad (Uusikaupunki in Finnish) in 1617, and Nykarleby (Uusikaarlepyy in Finnish), Karleby (Kokkola in Finnish) and Torneå (Tornio in Finnish) in 1620. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> characterised by strict grid street plans, which were filled in with single-storey vernacular-style wooden buildings. Even stricter building and planning regulations came with the appointment of Per Brahe as Governor-General of Finland in 1637 (a position he held intermittently until 1653). Among the new towns founded by Brahe were Hämeenlinna, Savonlinna, Kajaani, Raahe and Kristinestad as well as shifting the position of Helsinki.|$|E

500|$|Union Environment and Forests Minister Javadekar {{said the}} exact {{causes of the}} {{flooding}} – whether the result of climate change or stemming from other causes – remained in [...] "a grey area" [...] as experts had differing opinions. Regarding the current floods, he said the United Nations would not deem the evidence conclusive {{enough to be able}} to reach a judgment. [...] "One thing is sure, climate change brings such disasters more frequently. So [...] frequency, [...] ferocity of untimely rains increases, [...] erratic monsoons, droughts and floods; <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> caused [...]" [...] he said. He subsequently clarified his position on the Tamil Nadu floods in a written statement addressed to the Rajya Sabha. According to Javadekar, the recent extreme rainfall across the region was [...] "highly localised" [...] and could not be definitively attributed to the effects of climate-change. [...] " [...] extreme rainfall that occurred over [...] coastal districts of Tamil Nadu is part of the natural variability of the Indian monsoon system. Although some studies have reported an increase in frequency and intensity of extremes in rainfall during the past 40–50 years, their attribution to global warming is not established." [...] Javadekar said the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and local assessments have indicated that extreme rainfall events will likely increase in frequency by the end of the 21st century.|$|E
