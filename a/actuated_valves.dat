25|$|All cars must be front-engined and rear-wheel drive. All cars use a 5.0-litre, {{naturally}} aspirated V8-engine with electronic fuel injection, {{capable of producing}} between 460 and 485 kW (620–650 bhp). Manufacturers are free to choose between using an engine based on one from their own line up or a generic engine provided by V8 Supercars. Both Ford and Holden use US-based racing engines with pushrod <b>actuated</b> <b>valves</b> and two valves per cylinder. Mercedes, Nissan and Volvo use modified versions of their own engines, with hydraulic-lift valves and four valves per cylinder. All engines are electronically limited to 7,500 rpm and have a compression ratio of 10:1.|$|E

Each circuit connects two tanks, and has its individual pressure transducer, valves, pressure regulator and electrically <b>actuated</b> <b>valves.</b> The circuits {{are separated by}} two squib <b>actuated</b> <b>valves</b> that enable to share both circuits, to use a single one, or to use both systems independently.The Helium is stored initially at [...] and is regulated to , with a maximum pressure of [...] and a minimum of , which is the minimum required pressure to activate the pneumatically <b>actuated</b> <b>valves</b> of the SKD.|$|E

50|$|A bash valve is a valve {{within a}} piston engine, {{used to control}} the {{admission}} of the working fluid. They are directly <b>actuated</b> <b>valves,</b> operated by contact between the piston and the valve tip.|$|E
50|$|The {{first and}} second DPO {{circuits}} are connected through electro-hydraulic <b>actuated</b> <b>valves</b> that enable the transfer of propellant between line in case of failure of one pressurization or propellant storage circuit. So the system has dual and redundant circuits at all its stages. The total propellant load can vary between 440 kg and 892 kg.|$|E
50|$|The main {{benefit of}} these systems is that {{positioners}} are common equipment on plants and thus operators {{are familiar with the}} operation {{of these systems}}, however the primary drawback is the increased risk of spurious trip caused by the introduction of additional control components that are not normally used on on/off valves. These systems are however limited to use on pneumatically <b>actuated</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|E

50|$|K4s 5399 was rebuilt by Lima in 1939, with, {{among other}} improvements, poppet valves {{actuated}} by Franklin oscillating cams. K4s 5436 was fitted with stem <b>actuated</b> <b>valves</b> in 1940. They {{were designed by}} Lloyd Jones, the Engineer of tests at the Altoona Works. in 1945, K4s 3847 was given a front-end throttle and Franklin rotary-actuated poppet valves. All performed well, but were difficult to maintain.|$|E
50|$|An {{expected}} {{disadvantage of}} this variable cycle {{system would be}} increased complexity and weight. GE claims to have combated this by using simple pressure driven valves rather than complex mechanically <b>actuated</b> <b>valves</b> to divert airflow. GE stated that this system resulted in the variable cycle system adding only 10 lb to the engine. Additionally, a production F120 engine was expected to have 40% fewer parts than the F110 engine.|$|E
