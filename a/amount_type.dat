5|$|General {{relativity}} is {{the geometric}} theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 {{and the current}} description of gravitation in modern physics. It {{is the basis of}} current cosmological models of the Universe. General relativity generalizes special relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime {{is directly related to the}} energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations. In general relativity, the distribution of matter and energy determines the geometry of spacetime, which in turn describes the acceleration of matter. Therefore, solutions of the Einstein field equations describe the evolution of the Universe. Combined with measurements of the <b>amount,</b> <b>type,</b> and distribution of matter in the Universe, the equations of general relativity describe the evolution of the Universe over time.|$|E

Illegal drugs fall into different categories and sentences {{vary depending on the}} <b>amount,</b> <b>type</b> of drug, circumstances, and jurisdiction. In the U.S., the penalty for illegal drug possession and sale can vary from a small fine to a prison sentence. In some states, marijuana possession {{is considered to be a}} petty offense, with the penalty being comparable to that of a speeding violation. In some municipalities, possessing a small quantity of marijuana in one's own home is not punishable at all. Generally, however, drug possession is an arrestable offense, although first-time offenders rarely serve jail time. Federal law makes even possession of [...] "soft drugs", such as cannabis, illegal, though some local governments have laws contradicting federal laws.|$|E

50|$|Individuals or {{companies}} {{involved in}} arranging biodiversity offsets will use quantitative measures {{to determine the}} <b>amount,</b> <b>type</b> and quality of habitat {{that is likely to}} be affected by a proposed project. Then, they will establish a new location or locations (often called receptor sites) where {{it would be possible to}} re-create the same <b>amount,</b> <b>type</b> and quality of habitat. The aim of biodiversity offsets is not simply to provide financial compensation for the biodiversity losses associated with development, although developers might pay financial compensation in some cases if it can be demonstrated exactly what the physical biodiversity gains achieved by that compensation will be. The type of environmental compensation provided by biodiversity offsetting is different from similar systems in that it must show both measurable and long-term biodiversity improvements, that can be demonstrated to counteract losses.|$|E

50|$|In our {{quest to}} find more oil and gas, we use {{numerous}} petroleum geochemical techniques to (1) identify source rocks and determine the <b>amount,</b> <b>type,</b> and maturation level of the organic matter; (2) evaluate the potential timing of petroleum migration from the source rock; (3) assess the potential migration pathways; and (4) correlate petroleum compounds found in reservoirs, leaks, and surface seeps to find new pools of petroleum. Some of the petroleum geochemical techniques used are: stable isotopes; hydrocarbon analysis (fingerprinting) of specific organic compounds (biological organic markers) with gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS); maturity indicators like vitrinite reflectance; laboratory pyrolysis and analysis; kerogen typing; and other more exotic techniques.|$|E

Other artefacts that were found comprised animal bones. Of these, horse mandibles were found. Horses were very valuable to the prehistoric people, as they provided a means of transport, and could supplement or replace man-power. They could be used to carry or pull timbers on sledges, for example, over long distances. Significance is also drawn from the discovery of the ritual deposits within thirty metres of the timber post line, and only on its southern boundary. The <b>amount,</b> <b>type,</b> and placement of deposits, which continued for over 1,200 years, supports the theory that 'at least one facet of the site' was a role as a 'religious monument'.|$|E

50|$|A {{foreland}} basin existed just to {{the east}} of the Sevier orogenic belt, which was inundated by the Western Interior Seaway. A forearc on the western side of the basin made this deeper than the eastern side, encouraging the build-up of sediment and, in time, sedimentary rock. Erosion of the Western Cordillera also contributed to the build-up of sedimentary rock on {{the western edge of the}} basin, while the more low-lying area to the east provided much less. Changes in the <b>amount,</b> <b>type,</b> rate, and other aspects of the sedimentation were caused by uplift, subsidence, sea level changes, and other factors. The water in the basin made at least two major advances and one major retreat during the Cretaceous, adding complexity to the rock and permitting the creation of riverine, marsh, and estuarine rock in addition to the principal shallow and deep marine rock.|$|E

50|$|Parental {{mediation}} of adolescents’ television viewing {{is a significant}} factor in countering sexual media influence. Restrictive mediation involves implementing rules and limits for the <b>amount,</b> <b>type,</b> and occasions on which television can be viewed. Restrictive mediation is negatively related to adolescents’ intention to engage in sexual intercourse in the future. This type of parental limitation was also positively associated with increased expectations of negative health consequences following sexual intercourse. Parental mediation can be a moderating influence on the effects of sexual television, but longitudinal studies are needed to examine the long-term effects. Individual differences also influence the impact of televised sexual content on adolescents’ sexual behavior. Adolescents who identify with television characters engaging in sexual behavior are more likely to develop confidence in their own ability to engage in these actions, compared to adolescents who do not identify with these television characters. This relationship is only seen when television characters have a successful outcome in their sexual pursuits. Therefore, in addition to the amount of media exposure, interpersonal variation (such as viewer identification with television characters) {{plays an important role in}} determining the influence of television on adolescent sexual behavior.|$|E
50|$|In December 1943, the {{squadron}} received {{a flight of}} three B-17s on detached service from ATC. These heavier aircraft with four engines were better {{able to handle the}} rough winter weather. When they started flying in February 1944, they flew a synoptic track out and back from either Goose Bay or Gander Field. This was at first designated Flight B, later as Falcon Flight. On a typical mission, the airplane started at 0730GMT from Gander and flew a round trip of 1400 nautical miles. On the outbound segment, the airplane flew 700 nautical miles at 10,000 feet and returned inbound at 500 feet. During the flight, the weather officer periodically recorded the altitude, temperature, air pressure, relative humidity and the wind speed and direction. He also recorded the amount and duration of any icing, the strength and location of any cold fronts and the <b>amount,</b> <b>type</b> and height of any clouds. The readings were reported every 100 miles by radio. These missions continued until February 1945. Meanwhile, the three B-25s that were left behind at Presque Isle in December 1943 were organized into Flight A and flew a few missions that winter between Presque Isle, Goose Bay and Gander Field.|$|E
