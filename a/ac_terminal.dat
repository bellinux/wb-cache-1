An example of a voltage doubler is found in the input stage of switch mode power supplies containing a SPDT switch to select either 120 V or 240 V supply. In the 120 V position the input is typically configured as a full-wave voltage doubler by opening one AC connection point of a bridge rectifier, and connecting the input to the junction of two series-connected filter capacitors. For 240 V operation, the switch configures the system as a full-wave bridge, re-connecting the capacitor center-tap wire to the open <b>AC</b> <b>terminal</b> of a bridge rectifier system.

40|$|Transposable {{elements}} {{have long}} been considered as potential agents of large-scale genome reorganization {{by virtue of their}} ability to induce chromosomal rearrangements such as deletions, duplications, inversions, and reciprocal translocations. Previous researchers have shown that particular configurations of transposon termini can induce chromosome rearrangements at high frequencies. Here, we have analyzed chromosomal rearrangements derived from an unstable allele of the maize P 1 (pericarp color) gene. The progenitor allele contains both a full-length Ac (Activator) transposable element and an <b>Ac</b> <b>terminal</b> fragment termed fAc (fractured Ac) inserted in the second intron of the P 1 -rr gene. Two rearranged alleles were derived from a classical maize ear twinned sector and were found to contain a large inverted duplication and a corresponding deficiency. The sequences at the junctions of the rearrangement breakpoints indicate that the duplication and deletion structures were produced by a single transposition event involving Ac and fAc termini located on sister chromatids.

40|$|A {{multiphase}} motor {{has several}} major advantages, {{such as high}} reliability, fault tolerance, and high power density. It is a critical issue to develop a reliable and efficient multiphase motor drive system. In this paper, a transformerless voltage source converter-based drive system for a medium-voltage (MV) multiphase motor is proposed. This drive converter employs cascaded H-bridge rectifiers loaded by H-bridge inverters as the interface between the grid and multiphase motor. The cascaded H-bridge rectifier technique makes the drive system able to be directly connected to the MV grid without the phase-shifting transformer because it can offset the voltage level gap between the MV grid and the semiconductor devices, provide near-sinusoidal <b>AC</b> <b>terminal</b> voltages without filters, and draw sinusoidal line current from the grid. Based on a digital signal processor (DSP), a complete improved Phase Disposition Pulse Width Modulation (PD-PWM) method is developed to ensure the individual DC-link capacitor voltage balancing for enhancing the controllability and limiting the voltage and power stress on the H-bridge cells. A downscaled prototype is designed and developed based on a nine-phase motor.

40|$|A new hybrid {{cascaded}} modular multilevel converter for high-voltage dc (HVDC) {{transmission system}} is presented. The half-bridge (HB) cells are {{used on the}} main power stage and the cascade full-bridge (FB) cells are connected to its <b>ac</b> <b>terminals.</b> The main power stage generates the fundamental voltages with quite low switching frequency, resulting relatively low losses. The cascaded FB cells only attenuate the harmonics generated by the main power stage, without contribution to the power transfer. Thus, the energy storage requirement of the cascaded FB cells is low and the capacitance of FB cells is reduced significantly. Due to the dc fault reverse blocking capability of the cascaded FB cells, the proposed topology can ride-through the pole-to-pole dc fault. In addition the soft restart is achieved after the fault eliminates, without exposing the system to significant inrush current.

PV systems need converters for maximum power point tracking, power conditioning, voltage step-up/down as necessary, and for storage charge-controlling. Inverters are needed for AC loads and for utility grid interfacing. The four basic DC-DC converters commonly used with PV systems have been reviewed and modelled. Different DC-AC inverter types and operational architectures have also been reviewed with the two-stage DC-AC inverter, with the {{point of common coupling}} (PCC) at the inverter input, suggested as the most cost-effective and efficient architecture for PV-based communal grids. This is because only one inverter is used for the entire system as opposed to an inverter for every module string, resulting in higher efficiencies, low cost, and low harmonic distortions when compared to systems with PCC at <b>AC</b> <b>terminal.</b> The aim of power conversion/ inversion is to extract maximum power possible from the PV system and where necessary, to invert it at close to 100 % as possible.

40|$|In this thesis, {{a compact}} and light primary {{switched}} conversion system for AC-fed railway propulsion is investigated. It {{is characterized by}} soft switching of all converter stages and a source commutated primary converter comprising series connected valves. Both weight and volume of the conversion system are reduced significantly compared to a conventional system with a low frequency transformer. The conversion system {{is made up of}} N isolated AC/DC conversion cells, each comprising a cycloconverter and a voltage source converter (VSC) coupled by a medium frequency transformer. The cells are series connected on the AC side and connected to a common DC-link. Thus, 2 N+ 1 voltage levels can be synthesized at the <b>AC</b> <b>terminal</b> and the voltage stress on the transformer and line filter is reduced compared to a one cell solution. Series connection of semiconductor valves allows independent choice of blocking voltage and number of converter cells. Choosing two converter cells is an attractive compromise. Five level output reduces the harmonic distortion and simplify transformer and line filter design while keeping the complexity of the conversion system low. The mutually commutated converter (MCC) allows a transformer frequency in the range of 4 to 8 kHz without derating the line side converter due to zero voltage switching of the VSC. Modern magnetic materials, like high silicon steel, amorphous and noncrystalline materials allow design of the transformer with high efficiency at elevated frequencies. In a 15 kV system, the peak voltage at the catenary is typically beyond 32 kV which is far beyond the voltage capability of currently available semiconductors. Therefore, several semiconductors are connected in series. Favourable commutation conditions and a new gate drive arrangement allow snubberless commutation of the primary converter stage. Thus, the primary converter can be highly integrated, reducing both weight and volume. The conversion system can be placed on the roof or in the underframe without compromising efficiency or vehicle performance. The feasibility of the conversion concept has been demonstrated by means of a down-scaled prototype. Snubberless commutation of series connected valves is demonstrated. QC 2010072...|$|E

Second, the tightly P 1 -linked P 2 gene (a duplicate of P 1) contributes to the silk browning phenotype and silk maysin levels. Third, probe npi 286 and dek 1 that were previously thought to be proximal to P 1 are probably in the distal side of P 1 locus.
