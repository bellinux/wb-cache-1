40|$|A novel {{physical}} {{perspective of}} molecular interactions within the cytoskeleton of the airway smooth muscle cell {{may help to}} explain why the most efficacious of all known bronchodilatory agencies—a simple deep inspiration—becomes abrogated during the spontaneous asthma attack and leads thereby to excessive airway narrowing. This perspective invites us to think of airway smooth muscle not only biochemically as a nidus of traditional cell signaling and immune modulation or mechanically as a motor for generation of active forces but also physically as a phase of soft condensed matter that can restrict airway stretch and dilation. This is perhaps a risky path and is surely an unconventional one, but it is where the trail of evidence leads. This line of investigation is unlikely by itself to provide an <b>asthma</b> <b>cure</b> but will lead to a new conceptual framework without which novel pathways, unsuspected phase transitions, and unanticipated mechanisms of action of target molecules would almost surely remain hidden.

30|$|T {{lymphocyte}} {{is one of}} the {{key players}} in the adaptive immune system and is involved in many kinds of inflammation [9, 10]. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by airway obstruction and hyper-responsiveness. The cells involved in the inflammatory response in asthma include lymphocytes, mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells [11]. So, the removal of the inflammatory cells is the key to radically <b>cure</b> <b>asthma.</b> The excessive activation of T cells is an important characteristic of asthma, because the activated T cells can release a variety of cytokines to activate B lymphocytes, macrophages, and so on [12]. So, the removal of T lymphocyte in the airway inflammation plays a key role in <b>curing</b> <b>asthma.</b> Most studies have suggested that apoptosis and oncosis are two crucial mechanisms for regulating immune and inflammatory responses [13]. The body massively weeds out the excess cells through oncosis [14]. In the past, AM treatments which induced the death mode of T lymphocyte have been studied biologically and/or biochemically. However, the quantitative analysis of morphological and nanostructural changes and the variations of cellular biomechanical properties in the context of AM treatment remain unclear yet because of the lack of sensitive quantitative techniques. In recent years, the nanostructure and mechanical properties of cells are becoming as indicators and regulators of physiological processes such as activation, differentiation, apoptosis, malignant phenotypes, and mitosis [10, 15 – 17]. Therefore, measurements of the morphology, the nanostructure, and the biomechanical properties of T lymphocyte treated with AM for different times at the nanoscale level are of major importance to further interpret the death mode of T lymphocyte in asthma and may lead to new insightful views to the mechanism of AM treating asthma.|$|R

40|$|SummaryAsthma is {{the most}} common {{respiratory}} disorder, and is characterized by distal airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. This disease challenges human health because of its increasing prevalence, severity, morbidity, and the lack of a proper and complete <b>cure.</b> <b>Asthma</b> is characterized by TH 2 –skewed inflammation with elevated pulmonary levels of IL- 4, IL- 5, and IL- 13 levels. Although there are early forays into targeting TH 2 immunity, less-specific corticosteroid therapy remains the immunomodulator of choice. Innate immune injury mediated by complement components also act as potent mediators of the allergic inflammatory responses and offer a new and exciting possibility for asthma immunotherapy. The complement cascade consists of a number of plasma- and membrane-bound proteins, and the cleavage products of these proteins (C 3 and C 5) regulate the magnitude of adaptive immune responses. Complement protein are responsible for many pathophysiological features of asthma, including inflammatory cell infiltration, mucus secretion, increases in vascular permeability, and smooth muscle cell contraction.

40|$|SYNOPSIS Six {{personally}} observed {{cases of}} this lesion are reported and {{the literature is}} reviewed. One hundred and thirty-four cases {{have been reported to}} date. The lesion has occurred in many sites, but is commonest in the thorax (60 %), abdomen (11 %), neck (14 %), and axilla (4 %). Ninety per cent of cases are symptomless or have only the pressure symptoms, 10 O%have systemic signs, namely, fever, raised ESR, anaemia, cured by removal of the tumour. These cases have a slightly different histology. All recorded cases have been benign. Microscopically the lesion is follicular but instead of germinal centres the follicles have one or more thick-walled arteries and often some surrounding histiocytes. Increased numbers of vessels occur between the follicles, whilst sinuses are absent. These vessels have thick, cellular walls like post-capillary venules. Sometimes they become hyaline. The cases with symptoms have true reaction centres as well as a few intrafollicular vessels. Between the follicles there are increased numbers of vessels and, in addition, there may be collections of plasma cells or eosinophils. In 1954 and 1956 Kane et al, and Castleman, Iverson, and Menendez, described 13 cases of intra-thoracic lymphoid tumours with a benign behaviour. They regarded them as lymph node hyperplasias and were at pains to distinguish them from thymomas. Since then numerous cases have been reported, but surprisingly very few in British literature.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Allergic asthma, {{which is the}} most {{frequent}} asthma phenotype, is mainly a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by elevated serum IgE levels and specific-IgE against common allergens. A significant group of asthmatic children have uncontrolled moderate/severe symptoms despite the use of medium/high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in combination with another controller. Asthma guidelines suggest omalizumab as an add-on therapy in these children and recent evidence has shown the efficacy and safety of this mAb against IgE. Recent findings <b>Asthma</b> cannot be <b>cured</b> and current available treatments are unable to modify the natural course of the disease. Recent studies have shown positive effects of omalizumab in reducing airway inflammation and remodelling. Herein, a 4 -year follow-up of a group of children with moderate/severe uncontrolled asthma taking part in a randomized double blind placebo control with omalizumab is shown. After discontinuation of anti-IgE, children were followed up for 4 years. During the first 3 years of follow-up, they were completely free of asthma symptoms without any need of ICS or rescue medication.

Medication, asthma triggers, age, and the environment are all factors that impact asthma management. There is a gap in research in terms of what lifestyle characteristics need to be in place in order for adults to manage asthma. Shaw found that posture care is a lifestyle variable that should be explored as it relates to asthma management in older adults. The Life University Clinic (Marietta, GA) sees asthmatic patients daily and teaches them about a posture care routine through a program called Straighten Up. Based on the health belief model, this study explored how the Straighten Up routine exercises impacted asthma management in adult asthmatic patients with severe asthma (n = 304). Ordinal regression and logistic regression was used to analyze the relationships between using the Straighten Up posture exercises (independent variable) for 3 months with 3 dependent variables: patients 2 ̆ 7 sleep patterns (night time awakenings due to asthma), use of quick relief medication, and hospitalizations (ER Visits) due to asthma. Straighten Up posture exercises reduced night time sleep interruptions, but not hospitalizations due to asthma or the use of quick relief medications. For persons with asthma, Straighten Up could be an additional tool to manage their asthma and reduce the known impacts of sleep deprivation including accidents, memory loss, and heart disease. For organizations who serve asthmatics, Straighten Up could be an additional resource to share with the population they serve. As a result of this study, Straighten Up exercises are recommended for adult asthmatics with severe asthma as part of their asthma management plan...|$|R
