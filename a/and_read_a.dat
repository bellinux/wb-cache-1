40|$|The current {{research}} {{was designed to}} examine if motivation to engage in exercise can change in response to differing emotional context and message framing of the behavior. In particular, self-reported motivation and desire to exercise were measured after an anger, fear, or neutral emotion-inducing task {{was followed by a}} short, realistic narrative on health behavior that was framed as either an opportunity to gain something or lose something. In the current study, participants were undergraduate psychology students at Central Washington University. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} six experimental conditions: 1) completing <b>an</b> anger-writing task <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> <b>a</b> gain-frame narrative; 2) completing <b>a</b> fear-writing task <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> <b>a</b> gain-frame narrative; 3) completing <b>a</b> control-writing task <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> <b>a</b> gain-frame narrative; 4) completing <b>an</b> anger-writing task <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> <b>a</b> loss-frame narrative; 5) completing <b>a</b> fear-writing task <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> <b>a</b> loss-frame narrative; <b>and</b> 6) completing <b>a</b> control-writing task <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> <b>a</b> loss-frame narrative. Based upon previous research on intentions to eat healthy food, it was hypothesized that, overall, participants exposed to an anger-induction task would be more motivated to exercise than those participants exposed to the fear or control task. It was also hypothesized that the combination of an anger-induction task with a gain-frame narrative would result in the greatest increase in motivation to exercise. The results of this study should have implications for developing effective motivational plans to increase exercise and health behaviors...|$|R
25|$|In December 1862, as Lincoln's {{deadline}} approached, John Sullivan Dwight approached Emerson, {{asking him}} to compose <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>a</b> poem {{as part of a}} concert planned for January 1 to celebrate the proclamation. Emerson was initially noncommittal, citing scheduling conflicts, but ultimately relented. His work on the poem was rushed, due to the short time frame and the poet's many other commitments. The bulk of the work of the poem came on December 31, the day before its debut.|$|E

25|$|Entremets {{also made}} an {{effective}} tool for political displays. One {{of the most}} famous examples is the so-called Feast of the Pheasant, arranged by Philip the Good of Burgundy in 1454. The theme of the banquet was the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, and included a vow by Philip and his guests to retake the city in a crusade, though this was never realized. There were several spectacular displays at the banquet referred to by contemporary witnesses as entremets. Guests were entertained by a wide range of extravagant displays of automatons in the form of fountains and pies containing musicians. At the end of the banquet, an actor representing the Holy Church rode in on an elephant <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>a</b> poem about the plight of Eastern Christianity under Ottoman rule.|$|E

25|$|Sequoyah first {{taught the}} syllabary to his six-year old daughter, Ayokeh (also spelled Ayoka), {{because he could}} not find adults willing to learn it. He {{traveled}} to the Indian Reserves in the Arkansaw Territory where some Cherokee had settled. When he tried to convince the local leaders of the syllabary's usefulness, they doubted him. Sequoyah asked each leader to say a word, which he wrote down, and then called his daughter in to read the words back. This demonstration convinced the leaders to let him teach the syllabary to a few more people. This took several months, during which it was rumored that he might be using the students for sorcery. After completing the lessons, Sequoyah wrote a dictated letter to each student, <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>a</b> dictated response. This test convinced the western Cherokee that he had created a practical writing system.|$|E
25|$|When he {{was five}} years old, Palin had his first acting {{experience}} at Birkdale playing Martha Cratchit in a school performance of A Christmas Carol. At the age of 10, Palin, still interested in acting, made a comedy monologue <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>a</b> Shakespeare play to his mother while playing all the parts. After his school days in 1962 {{he went on to}} read modern history at Brasenose College, Oxford. With fellow student Robert Hewison he performed and wrote, for the first time, comedy material at a university Christmas party. Terry Jones, also a student in Oxford, saw that performance and began writing together with Hewison and Palin. In the same year Palin joined the Brightside and Carbrook Co-operative Society Players and first gained fame when he won an acting award at a Co-op drama festival. He also performed and wrote in the Oxford Revue (called the Et ceteras) with Jones.|$|E

500|$|Emir Isa bin Salman died {{suddenly}} on 6 March and was succeeded by his eldest son, Hamad bin Isa al Khalifa.

Before getting pardoned, al-Jamri had to appear on nationaltelevision <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>a</b> [...] "humiliating letter of apology" [...] to the Emir. Repeated meetings between commissioners of the Emir and al-Jamri were held during the house arrest period. Subsequent days saw the release of further political prisoners, and exiles were allowed to return.

Although he was not gregarious, he formed several close friendships with associates such as Charles Young, Paul Laurence Dunbar, John Hope and Mary White Ovington. His closest friend was Joel Spingarn– a white man– but Du Bois never accepted Spingarn's offer to be on a first name basis. Du Bois was something of a dandy– he dressed formally, carried a walking stick, and walked with an air of confidence and dignity. He was relatively short, standing at , and always maintained a well-groomed mustache and goatee. He enjoyed singing and playing tennis.|$|E
500|$|First off, Pausch {{explained}} {{his dream of}} being in zero gravity. As a child, {{this had been a}} dream inspired by Apollo 11, and had stayed with him as an adult. When he was the computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, he learned of a program that NASA has that allows college students to go up into the air in NASA's Vomit Comet, which uses parabolic arcs to simulate the feeling of weightlessness. Faculty members were not allowed to go (Pausch called this a [...] "brick wall" [...] he faced), so he had to present himself as a web journalist, because local media was allowed on. Pausch proceeded to begin talking about his second childhood dream, playing in the National Football League. Although Pausch was never a player in the National Football League, he spoke about his childhood experiences with Pop Warner Football and how they had affected his life and taught him lessons. Pausch then moved on to his dream of publishing an article in the World Book Encyclopedia. As a child, Pausch always kept <b>and</b> <b>read</b> <b>a</b> World Book Encyclopedia in his home. As he progressed into a career, {{he became one of the}} leading professors in the field of virtual reality. World Book then called Pausch, interested in him writing for the encyclopedia.
