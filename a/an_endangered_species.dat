5|$|The {{intrusion}} of urban areas into wilderness {{has had a}} substantial impact on wildlife, and several species of animals are considered endangered in the Everglades region. One animal that has benefited from endangered species protection is the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), whose holes give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during times of drought. Once abundant in the Everglades, the alligator was listed as <b>an</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and the banning of alligator hunting allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 {{and is no longer}} <b>an</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species.</b> However, alligators' territories and average body masses {{have been found to be}} generally smaller than in the past, and because populations have been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.|$|E

5|$|Historically {{regarded}} as a barren, desolate and dangerous to cross, the Pine Bush {{has come to be}} seen as a historical, cultural, and environmental asset to the Capital District and Hudson Valley regions of New York.

5|$|Historically, {{hunting and}} habitat loss have {{severely}} impacted American alligator populations throughout their range, {{and whether the}} species would survive was in doubt. In 1967, the American alligator was listed as <b>an</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> (under a law that was the precursor Endangered Species Act of 1973), since it {{was believed to be}} in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.|$|E

5|$|Like {{all other}} large whales, the fin whale was heavily hunted during the 20th century and is <b>an</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species.</b> Over 725,000 fin whales were {{reportedly}} {{taken from the}} Southern Hemisphere between 1905 and 1976; as of 1997 only 38,000 survived. Recovery of the overall population size of southern species is predicted to be at less than 50% of its pre-whaling state by 2100 due to heavier impacts of whaling and slower recovery rates.|$|E
5|$|The first {{description}} of B.nothofagi {{was published in}} 2012 by Jerry A. Cooper and Patrick Leonard. DNA studies of the fungus {{suggest that it is}} a somewhat basal member of the genus Boletopsis. The fungus is most likely a native species of New Zealand and was present there before the arrival of Europeans. As it is very rare and possibly threatened, B.nothofagi is listed in the Red List of Threatened Species as <b>an</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E

50|$|Schaus' swallowtail, Papilio aristodemus, is <b>an</b> <b>endangered</b> {{butterfly}} <b>species</b> of {{the family}} Papilionidae. It is named after a Miami physician, William Schaus, who discovered it in 1911. They are <b>an</b> extremely <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> with only <b>a</b> few hundred individuals left.

5|$|Banksia oligantha {{is listed}} as <b>an</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), and as rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. These rankings are due to its small and {{severely}} fragmented distribution, and the ongoing degradation of its habitat. Threats include grazing by sheep and rabbits, drought, the drift of aerosol chemicals from surrounding farmland, invasion by weeds, and rising salinity. Studies have shown it to be moderately susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E
5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} nests in hollows situated high {{in trees}} with fairly large diameters, generally Eucalyptus. With {{much of its}} habitat lost to land clearing and development and threatened by further habitat destruction, Carnaby's black cockatoo is listed as <b>an</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> by the Federal and Western Australian governments. It is also classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Like most parrots, it is protected by CITES, an international agreement that makes trade, export, and import of listed wild-caught species illegal.|$|E
5|$|Conservation and {{recovery}} plans for A. brownii {{have been proposed}} by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) which administers the island of Nihoa {{as part of the}} Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. In 1996, the plant was listed by the FWS as <b>an</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species.</b> In 2003, the FWS designated the island of Nihoa as a critical habitat for the plant and it was classified as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. The plant is one of 51 endangered or threatened plants in the Hawaiian Islands listed under the Endangered Species Act.|$|E

5|$|Its hairless, splotchy gray or gray-brown skin {{falls in}} folds to the shoulder, back and rump. The skin has a natural mosaic pattern, which lends the rhino an armored appearance. The neck {{folds of the}} Javan {{rhinoceros}} are smaller {{than those of the}} Indian rhinoceros, but still form a saddle shape over the shoulder. Because of the risks of interfering with such <b>an</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species,</b> however, the Javan rhinoceros is primarily studied through fecal sampling and camera traps. They are rarely encountered, observed or measured directly.|$|E
5|$|Loggerheads are {{considered}} <b>an</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> and {{are protected by}} the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Untended fishing gear is responsible for many loggerhead deaths. Turtles may also suffocate if they are trapped in fishing trawls. Turtle excluder devices have been implemented in efforts to reduce mortality by providing an escape route for the turtles. Loss of suitable nesting beaches {{and the introduction of}} exotic predators have also taken a toll on loggerhead populations. Efforts to restore their numbers will require international cooperation, since the turtles roam vast areas of ocean and critical nesting beaches are scattered across several countries.|$|E
5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{is listed}} as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Historically, hunting had decimated their population, and the American alligator was listed as <b>an</b> <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> by the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Subsequent conservation efforts have allowed their numbers to increase and the species {{was removed from the}} list in 1987. American alligators are now harvested for their skins and meat. The species is the official state reptile of three states: Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi.|$|E
