5|$|Chopin {{has figured}} {{extensively}} in Polish literature, both in serious critical studies {{of his life}} <b>and</b> <b>music</b> <b>and</b> in fictional treatments. The earliest manifestation was probably an 1830 sonnet on Chopin by Leon Ulrich. French writers on Chopin (apart from Sand) have included Marcel Proust and André Gide; and he has also featured in works of Gottfried Benn and Boris Pasternak. There are numerous biographies of Chopin in English (see bibliography for some of these).|$|E
5|$|He found birdsong fascinating, notating bird songs {{worldwide}} and incorporating birdsong transcriptions into his music. His innovative use of colour, {{his conception of}} the relationship between time <b>and</b> <b>music,</b> <b>and</b> his use of birdsong are among the features that make Messiaen's music distinctive.|$|E
5|$|Williams Center for the Arts is the college's {{performing}} arts center. Completed in 1983, the building houses the Performance Series, the Williams Art Gallery and College Collections, the College Theater program, {{the departments of}} Art <b>and</b> <b>Music,</b> <b>and</b> the student-led Arts Society. The centerpiece of the Williams Center is the 400-seat theater/concert hall and also contains a versatile art gallery, a 100-seat black box theater, and classrooms and studios for music and art.|$|E

5|$|A new wing {{was added}} in early 1980 to provide {{additional}} space for the arts, with a large room for orchestra <b>and</b> <b>music</b> <b>and</b> another for studio art. Filling in the previously open {{east side of the}} courtyard, the design is nearly identical in design to the original school, built of red and white-washed brick with a cloister on the courtyard side. The Gatehouse, which was built in 1929 and had served as the headmaster's residence, was remodeled to house the early childhood program in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Advertising {{alcohol on}} {{television}} and in the press was outlawed under president Marc Ravalomanana. In order to maximize brand recognition of THB, the company altered the label for its Fresh shandy, which was exempt from this ban due to its low alcohol content, to match the THB Pilsener design but using a green background instead of the pilsener's red. The pilsener is advertised in a variety of non-traditional ways, such as through celebrity promotion in music videos <b>and</b> <b>music</b> <b>and</b> sporting event sponsorship. THB is considered by the public as a promoter of Malagasy culture and identity, particularly through its sponsorship of its annual THB Tour traveling music festival and the THB fête de la bière (beer festival). Three Horses Beer sponsors the THB Champions League, the national football championship. Many popular musical artists have advertised THB, including superstars Jerry Marcoss, AmbondronA, Samoëla, Tsiliva, Tence Mena and Jaojoby.|$|E

5|$|Although the Coffins {{had little}} money, their life with Alice's upper-class {{relatives}} gave Marian an almost aristocratic upbringing that {{introduced her to}} high society on the East Coast and enabled her to make social connections that were to be extremely valuable in later life. However, she received almost no formal education, a deficiency that caused significant problems for her in her college years. She was instead tutored at home, where she also enjoyed the benefits of exposure to fine art <b>and</b> <b>music</b> <b>and</b> became an accomplished horse rider.|$|E
5|$|Belgrade is {{the most}} {{important}} media hub in Serbia. The city is home to the main headquarters of the national broadcaster Radio Television Serbia (RTS), which is a public service broadcaster.

One of the most popular commercial broadcaster is B92, another media company, which has its own TV station, radio station, <b>and</b> <b>music</b> <b>and</b> book publishing arms, as well as the most popular website on the Serbian internet. Other TV stations broadcasting from Belgrade include 1Prva (formerly Fox televizija), Nova, N1 and others which only cover the greater Belgrade municipal area, such as Studio B.|$|E
5|$|Berge and Brundtland were {{introduced}} to each other through a mutual friend in Tromsø, Norway. They enjoyed the same films <b>and</b> <b>music,</b> <b>and</b> shared an interest in electronics. The two experimented with various forms of electronic music, and bought a drum machine together during the Tromsø techno scene before going their separate ways. Several years later, the two met up again and formed Röyksopp during the Bergen Wave. After experimenting with different genres of electronic music, the band solidified {{their place in the}} electronica scene with their 2001 debut album, Melody A.M., released on the Wall of Sound record label.|$|E

5|$|Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary was {{developed}} as a partnership between development studios 343 Industries, Saber Interactive, and Certain Affinity. 343 Industries, the Halo series' franchise overseers, approached Saber Interactive to develop a remake of the original Halo in time for its tenth anniversary. After considering whether to remake the game entirely or to adapt and add features to the existing PC version, Saber decided to use its game engine for reproducing the original's appearance and the original Halos engine for gameplay. A development tool for toggling between {{the old and new}} visuals became a game feature. Anniversarys enhancements include a complete high-definition visual overhaul, support for cooperative and multiplayer gameplay via the Xbox Live online service, new and remastered sound effects <b>and</b> <b>music,</b> <b>and</b> extras such as achievements and hidden in-game collectibles. The game is the first in the series to include Kinect support.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} New York's School of Industrial Art {{where he}} studied painting <b>and</b> <b>music</b> <b>and</b> would later appreciate their emphasis on proper technique. But he dropped out at age 16 to help support his family. He worked as a copy boy and runner for the Associated Press in Manhattan and in several other low-skilled, low-paying jobs. However, he mostly {{set his sights on}} a professional singing career, returning to performing as a singing waiter, playing and winning amateur nights all around the city, and having a successful engagement at a Paramus, New Jersey, nightclub.|$|E
5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band <b>and</b> <b>music</b> <b>and</b> we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E

5|$|Innocence began {{production}} in 2006 at Alfa System {{as the next}} main entry in the Tales series. Developed parallel to the DS spin-off title Tales of the Tempest, {{the goal was to}} include all the series' main gameplay and narrative elements despite the limited medium. The character designs were done by Mutsumi Inomata, while the music was composed by series newcomer Kazuhiro Nakamura. Extensive voice acting was included using CRI Middleware's Kyuseishu Sound Streamer compression algorithm. After release, it was decided to remake Innocence for the Vita, using platform-specific gameplay functions, redone voice work <b>and</b> <b>music,</b> <b>and</b> new characters. Japanese singer-songwriter Kokia created the opening theme songs for both versions of Innocence. Both versions have been positively received in Japan, and Western opinions on the two versions of Innocence have been mostly positive.|$|E
5|$|Stoddart {{was born}} in Edinburgh and raised in Renfrewshire, where he {{developed}} an early interest in the arts <b>and</b> <b>music,</b> <b>and</b> later trained in fine art at the Glasgow School of Art (1976–1980) and read the History of Art at the University of Glasgow. During this time he became increasingly critical of contemporary trends in art, such as pop art, and concentrated on creating figurine pieces in clay. Stoddart associates the lack of form in modern art with social decay; in contrast, his works include many classical allusions.|$|E

5|$|The audio dramas were {{originally}} published as three CD albums by 5pb. between March and June 2010, and were later collected {{along with other}} Steins;Gate material in a 2016 box set. They feature voice acting by the cast from the Steins;Gate game, <b>and</b> <b>music</b> <b>and</b> cover art by the game's composer Takeshi Abo and character designer Huke, respectively. The dramas were well received by critics and popular with fans, leading {{to the creation of}} manga and light novel adaptations. They were also used as the base for the Epigraph Trilogy of light novels and the Steins;Gate 0 video game. The trilogy was recorded in Japanese, but the third drama has gotten an English fan translation.|$|E
5|$|The {{figure of}} Hope holds a broken lyre, {{based on an}} ancient Athenian wood and {{tortoiseshell}} lyre then {{on display in the}} British Museum. Although broken musical instruments were a frequently occurring motif in European art, they had never previously been associated with Hope. Hope's lyre has only a single string remaining, on which she attempts to play. She strains to listen {{to the sound of the}} single unbroken string, symbolising both persistence and fragility, and the closeness of hope and despair. Watts had recently shown interest in the idea of a continuity between the visual arts <b>and</b> <b>music,</b> <b>and</b> had previously made use of musical instruments as a way to invigorate the subjects of his portraits.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} a character named Jason who follows his pet frog Fred down {{a hole in}} the earth. There he finds a tank and uses it to battle radioactive mutants. The player controls Jason and the tank Sophia the 3rd through eight levels of gameplay to find the whereabouts of Fred and to defeat the mutants and their leader, the Plutonium Boss. The game was praised for its smooth play control and level designs, detailed and clean graphics, <b>and</b> <b>music,</b> <b>and</b> it was criticized for its high difficulty level and lack of passwords or save points. The game was novelized by Peter Lerangis, as part of the Worlds of Power series published by Scholastic Books.|$|E
