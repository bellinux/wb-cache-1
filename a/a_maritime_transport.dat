30|$|Tae-Woo Lee and Venus Lun (2016) {{note that}} {{shipping}} and port operations facilitate the scale economy in production and global shipping. Much {{of the positive}} economic development in the Nordic countries {{is associated with the}} efficient integration of maritime transport and port operations. Normally, <b>a</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> system consists of ports, logistics service operators and carriers, which connect export and import ports with regularly scheduled shipping lines. The remote area connections are operated by truck or rail logistics. This supply chain, including 24 / 7 manufacturing, needs to have continuous detailed planning of deliveries. The Nordic export industry ports {{play an important role in}} connecting remote areas to the world market. Álvarez-SanJaime et al. (2013) point out that the road transport sector does marginal cost pricing, whereas the shipping companies hold market power and enjoy economies of scale. Vaghi and Lucietti (2016) analyzed with a case study that it is possible to gain a significant amount of potential by decreasing the dwell time for containers in ports by speeding up of formalities. The simplification of customs procedures brings benefits for the transport time and costs. This type of research needs very detailed case data from an export company and from logistics service providers. Official public statistics do not offer detailed information.|$|E
40|$|Maritime {{transport}} is by {{its very}} nature an international mode of transport regulated by a large number of international treaties and conventions, most of them negotiated and concluded within the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Members of the international community, including some EU Member States themselves, were initially reluctant to transfer their sovereignty in this field of transport to the Community. However, two main events gradually changed the attitude of the Member States to the Community's competence to regulate this mode of transport. First, the mid- 1980 s impetus to establish an internal market by 1992 placed all modes of transport at the centre of the project. It was not feasible to establish a geographical market, stretching from the Atlantic to the Eastern European countries and from the North Sea to the Mediterranean, where goods, people, services and capital would be able to circulate freely, and in a competitive manner, without the Community seriously addressing transport issues. Thus, unsurprisingly, a number of important legislative proposals affecting the provisions of maritime transport services were adopted and implemented during that period. The second significant factor in the development of <b>a</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> policy was the number of serious marine accidents which took place in the Community's coastal waters during the last 20 years...|$|E

40|$|This {{multiple}} {{case study}} of 14 multimodal transport chains provides an insight on how international supply chains of Dangerous Goods (DG) work with an over-view of problems which the actors are faced. The data covers border-crossing transport chains in the Baltic Sea Region, which means that all movements involve <b>a</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> leg {{in one form or}} another. The main emphasis is on operations rather than costs in finding out how effective, efficient and professional the operations are in the various phases of the operations. The empirical case-data was collected by interviewing managerial level employees from the participating com-panies in late 2006. In the interviews it came up that the general public is interested in transport of DG, because of the risks that they present to the environment and people. However, shippers and transport companies tend to think that giving information to the public might increase people’s awareness about the DG issues and might also tighten the regulations in the future. Thus, firms prefer to give as little information as possible on DG transports. Requirements in DG transports stretch far beyond what is required in non-DG shipments. This calls for system-controlled operations, up-to-date equipment and well-trained personnel. In most of the studied cases DG cargo was transported in temperature regulated and specially built cargo units. The availability of such special equipment is often limited, which may affect the transport frequency. Special equipment also raises the cost of transport. A major identified problem was differing regulations across transport modes (such as IMDG vs. ADR vs. RID), which complicates supply chain operations. The study gives information on dangerous goods trans-port in the BSR, which has been very little studied. It gives important information regarding safety, security and environmental protection...|$|E

The dissertation investigates whether how it should be done to make arrivals and departures in the Port of Gothenburg more efficient. In addition to this, the report also presents already existing methods that already are being implemented in the industry of shipping and also projects that are under development in form of a prototype. The report is based on the todays current situation of already existing rules and procedures for port calls and also qualitative and semi-structured interviews with subsequent triangulation to create an understanding including the arrivals and departures in Energy Port for tankers. Through research, surveys and interviews the current situation in the Port of Gothenburg has been analyzed and has been identified during the process of the report and is presented in the section of results. This section provides the reader that there are potential and actions to be made to create more efficient solutions in the port. The most common reasons causing delays and extending lay times for docks are often due to physical document management, lack of information between stakeholders in maritime transports or misconceptions in communication among the port staff. The report describes and presents alternative solutions for the already demonstrated parts to be more efficient. For the physical document management that is common for use today, electronic document management is presented as a solution and reported as an efficiency method in the report. In the absence of information, the STM Validation Project is reported and misconceptions in communication, developed work instructions. The main conclusion and discussion cover the writers’ thoughts and opinions, as well as facts about the impact of the mentioned efficiency-enhancing methods as well as the potential opportunities that can be achieved because of their implementation...|$|E
40|$|The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) {{has many}} ports, {{all of which}} were built along the Congo River and its affluent. Some of them are used solely for {{domestic}} transport, while others are used for international trade. The Congolese maritime ports that are used for international trade were constructed along the Congo River during the colonial period and have belonged to the Congolese government since 1935. Under State control, these ports are run by the Office National des Transports (Onatra). Onatra, a Congolese public enterprise that specializes in transport, is owned, in its entirety, by the Congolese government. Over the past few decades international trade and maritime ports, as centers for the international transport of goods, have experienced significant changes. With the recent phenomena of containerization and globalization, the maritime transport sector has grown exponentially. As a result, the efficiency of port industries has become increasingly important to port users “for whom ports services have always constituted a bottleneck in periods of rapid international trade. ” In an effort {{to meet the needs of}} this rapidly growing industry and satisfy the demand for increased efficiency most maritime ports have invested in infrastructure and technology renewal. The expansion and modernization of maritime ports and changes in the shipping industry have resulted in <b>a</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> and management system that is characterized by “mega-carriers and megaships calling at efficient mega-ports. ” Globalization of trade and expansion of import-export activities in Africa places many African countries, including the DRC, in a position to be major players in the future of international trade. This is particularly important to the DRC because increased trade “opens access to new markets and opportunities... fostering [the] export-led economic growth [that is] essential to alleviate poverty on a significant scale. ” At the same time, most African maritime ports are not equipped to satisfy the needs of the globalized maritime sector. In addition, management, port access, security, and cost issues have had a negative impact on the number of ships calling on these ports. Consequently, the DRC’s maritime ports have been marginalized in international trade. This Article outlines these issues in greater detail and explores potential solutions to these problems. In addition, this Article calls for reforms to Onatra, evaluates the steps that the Congolese government has already taken, and suggests alternatives for improving management and attracting much needed capital...|$|E

40|$|This {{report has}} {{examined}} the concept of value creation in the maritime chain of transportation. <b>A</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> chain can best be conceptualized as a network through which carriers (e. g. shipping companies and haulage providers) and third parties (e. g. terminal operators, freight forwarders, brokers and agents) provide services for the movement of cargo provided by shippers. The main actors in the maritime chain of transportation are the carriers who add value to the shipper by moving goods from areas with excess supply to areas with excess demand. In this process a number of (independent) third parties may provide a number of services. The shipper and/or carrier will employ these agents if the rise in costs is more than compensated by {{the value of the}} service. The third parties can thus only exist if they provide value added services to the carrier and/or to other third party service providers. From a financial perspective value is created when a business earns revenue that exceeds the expenses. In many sectors, however, value is increasingly being created by more intangible drivers such as research, innovation, branding, ideas and networks which usually provide indirect rather than direct benefits (Kaplan & Norton, 2004 a; 2004 b). This is also the case within maritime logistics. According to Johansson et al. (1993) third parties may add value through (1) improve the level of service, (2) quality, (3) cost and (4) time reduction. The chartering agent’s network and market knowledge allows him to speed up the search time and match process for shippers and carriers (time reduction). The port agent’s local network allows him to speed up port operations (time reduction) and make the necessary arrangement on behalf of the carrier (service). Freight forwarders may take over part of the production chain and provide services which manufacturers don’t consider their core business (service). This includes assembly, quality control, customizing and packing of goods, pest control and after sales services. Third party ship management companies may reduce costs through economies of scale (cost reduction) and increase quality of crew and equipment maintenance through specialization (quality). Just to mention a few. While the report has investigated the concept of value creation, the question of value capturing has not been addressed in this study. Value capturing depends on the individual transactions between the actors in the chain. A port agent may add value to a carrier by securing smooth port operations and thus reduce waiting time. The added value may, however, be captured by a freight forwarder who forces the carrier to lower the price or more likely be distributed among several actors. The business model literature may provide a fruitful lens for exploring this in greater depth. The maritime chain of transportation is becoming increasingly complex and involves an increasing number of actors. The services of some actors are furthermore overlapping. Inland haulage can thus be provided by shippers, freight forwarders, independent liner agents, in-house liner sales offices, or by an independent haulage provider. Freight forwarders are increasingly overtaking functions in the value chain from manufacturer etc. In order to successfully navigate this network is it important to have an overview of the chain of transportation at a more general level...|$|E
