Other potential victims were those who did not properly observe the burial ceremonies or kept the deceased's possessions instead of properly destroying them. Female vampires could return, lead a normal life and even marry but would eventually exhaust the husband with their sexual appetite.

A massive letter campaign and a 50,000-signature petition sent to President Herbert Hoover resulted in Stroud being permitted to keep his birds, and despite prison overcrowding, he was even given a second cell to house them. However, his letter-writing privileges were greatly curtailed. Jones and Stroud grew so close that she moved to Kansas in 1931, and started a business with him, selling his avian medicines.|$|E

With Khánh's grip on power shaky, an {{anonymous}} source said that Thảo was worried about how he would be treated if someone else took over: [...] "Thao acted first, {{out of fear that}} if he did not, the other generals would overthrow Khanh <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of him as well. He knew that if the others overthrew Khanh his fate would be worse than Khanh's." [...] During this time, Thảo kept in touch with elements of the CIA in an attempt to get American backing. Meanwhile, Khiêm had been putting pressure on Khánh for over two months by charging him and the Buddhists of seeking a [...] "neutralist solution" [...] and [...] "negotiating with the communists". At the same time, Khánh's relationship with the Americans—particularly Ambassador and retired General Maxwell Taylor—had broken down over a series of policy disputes and personal arguments, and the Americans were trying to encourage Khánh's colleagues to overthrow him so that more hawkish policies could be enacted. The other generals wanted to overthrow Khánh and were aware that Thảo—who was widely distrusted—was planning to make a move. They anticipated trouble in trying to keep their subordinates, who were becoming impatient with Khánh's ongoing tenure, from joining Thảo. Between January and February, Thảo continued to finalize the details of his own counter-coup, using the contacts he had cultivated over the past decades.|$|E
500|$|In late December 1964, Thảo {{was summoned}} back to Saigon by Khánh, who {{correctly}} suspected him and Khiêm of plotting together in Washington. Thảo believed Khánh {{was attempting to}} have him killed, so he went underground upon returning to Saigon, and began plotting in earnest, unfazed {{by the prospect of}} being charged for desertion. The ruling junta appealed to Thảo in newspaper advertisements and broadcasts to follow orders to report, but he ignored them. Due to his Catholicism, Thảo was able to recruit Diệm loyalists such as Phát. In mid-January 1965, the regime called for him to report to his superiors in the ARVN, warning that he would be [...] "considered guilty of abandoning his post with all the consequences of such a situation" [...] if he failed to do so. At this time, it was still not known that Thảo was a communist agent who was deliberately trying to cause infighting within South Vietnam at every opportunity. With Khánh's hold on power shaky, an anonymous source said Thảo was worried about how he would be treated if someone else took over: [...] "Thảo acted first, out of fear that if he did not, the other generals would overthrow Khánh <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of him as well.

Baird went downstairs and fetched an office worker, 20-year-old William Edward Taynton, to see what a human face would look like, and Taynton became the first person to be televised in a full tonal range. Looking for publicity, Baird visited the Daily Express newspaper to promote his invention.

This agreement is celebrated by the presence of a temple in which are icons of Lord Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva. Hanuman, the devout follower of Rama, is said to have been born on Anjenadri Hill near the Tungabhadra river facing Hampi. Hence his name is Anjaneya. Archaeology traces the history of Hampi to neolithic settlements while inscriptional evidence confirms that in more recent times the area came under the rule of the Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Hoysalas and finally the tiny kingdom of Kampili.|$|E

In describing the context of those statements, she gave a suggestive account that involved divergent interests of McLean and the Bureau in the welfare of an unidentified young girl who she said was a material witness in a “white slave” trafficking investigation. McLean later testified that his objection was that the Bureau had taken the girl from a hospital and was detaining her without charge. [...] He denied that he had asked that anyone be fired (let alone the sister of a senator whom McLean considered a friend), but expressed his view that the Bureau was “rather a dangerous toy for a sincere woman to play with,” referring to Van Winkle.|$|E

2500|$|Dance {{as a form}} of {{exercise}} has a long history in China. The Lüshi Chunqiu, an encyclopedia compiled in the third century B.C.E., during the Spring and Autumn period, describes how, two millennia earlier in the time of Emperor Yao, people began to dance slowly in order to reinvigorate their muscles after lengthy rains had kept them indoors, sometimes leading to joint diseases. Eventually they began dressing up in costumes and using props. [...] "As time passed, they discovered that some activities could promote appetite, strengthen muscles and bones, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of fatigue," [...] writes one historian of Chinese traditional medicine. [...] "Over a longer period of time, these activities became arranged in rhythms and movements which were harmonious and graceful—now they had dancing." [...] While these may have eventually evolved into modern breathing exercises, other commentators suggest a public aspect to such dancing analogous to modern square dancing may have been refined in later eras, such as the religious dances of the Warring States period that preceded the rise of Imperial China. A writer in Youth Times sees it as similar to public dancing in the Song Dynasty of the late first millennium C.E.|$|E

[...] When Nutting pointed out {{that they had no}} alternative government to replace Nasser, Eden apparently replied, [...] "I don't give a damn if there's anarchy and chaos in Egypt." [...] At a private meeting at Downing Street on 16 October 1956 Eden showed several ministers a plan, submitted two days earlier by the French. Israel would invade Egypt, Britain and France would give an ultimatum telling both sides to stop and, when one refused, send in forces to enforce the ultimatum, separate the two sides – and occupy the Canal <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of Nasser. When Nutting suggested the Americans should be consulted Eden replied, [...] "I will not bring the Americans into this ... Dulles has done enough damage as it is. This {{has nothing to do with}} the Americans. We and the French must decide what to do and we alone." [...] Eden openly admitted his view of the crisis was shaped by his experiences in the two world wars, writing, [...] "We are all marked to some extent by the stamp of our generation, mine is that of the assassination in Sarajevo and all that flowed from it. It is impossible to read the record now and not feel that we had a responsibility for always being a lap behind ... Always a lap behind, a fatal lap." ...|$|E
2500|$|Papen {{was deeply}} embittered {{by the way}} his former best friend, Schleicher, had brought him down, and having {{acquired}} a taste for power, Papen {{was determined to be}} Chancellor again. On 16 December 1932, Papen delivered a speech before the Herrenklub attacking Schleicher and demanding that the NSDAP be included in the government. Schleicher did not see Papen as a threat at all the Chancellor's Chief of Staff Erwin Planck told a group of journalists: [...] "Let him [...] talk, he's completely insignificant. No one takes him seriously. Herr von Papen is a pompous ass. This speech is the swan song of a bad loser". It was Papen who initialed contacts with Hitler as he was consumed, in the words of Kolb, with [...] "wounded ambition and a desire for revenge", becoming full of an obsessive hatred for his former best friend Schleicher. Papen contacted a friend, the Cologne banker Baron Kurt von Schröder who also happened to be a NSDAP member, in late December 1932 to ask him to pass on a message to Hitler saying that Hindenburg's previously warm relations with Schleicher were cooling and that he wanted to meet Hitler to discuss a common strategy against Schleicher. On 4 January 1933, Hitler and Papen met at {{what was supposed to be}} a secret meeting at Schröder's house in Cologne. Hitler spent much of the meeting ranting about how he should have been named Chancellor in August 1932 after his party won the largest number of seats in the Reichstag with Papen telling the lie that he had tried to persuade Hindenburg to appoint Hitler Chancellor that August, but had been blocked by Schleicher (the opposite was the case). For his part, Papen revealed a marked degree of hatred for Schleicher, with Goebbels writing in his diary afterwards: [...] "He [...] wants to bring about his [...] fall <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of him completely". The principal problem that emerged at the Cologne meeting was the question of who was to be Chancellor, as Papen insisted on having that office for himself whereas Hitler insisted equally vehemently on his [...] "all or nothing" [...] strategy of opposing every government not headed by himself, but the two agreed to keep talking. Papen had strengthened Hitler's hand by revealing to him that Hindenburg had not given Schleicher a decree dissolving the Reichstag nor was likely to do so, which meant when the Reichstag met after its Christmas break on 31 January 1933, it would be possible to bring a vote of no confidence against Schleicher without worrying about new elections.|$|E
