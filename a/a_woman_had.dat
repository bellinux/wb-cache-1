5|$|At {{the time}} British law {{relating}} to marriage {{was based on}} the legal doctrine of coverture, in which a woman's legal rights and obligations were subsumed by those of her husband upon their matrimony. By law <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> no separate legal existence, and all her property became her husband's; divorce initiated by a woman was difficult and complicated. In April 1868 Josephine and fellow suffragist Elizabeth Wolstenholme set up and became joint secretaries of the Married Women's Property Committee to pressure parliament into changing the law. Josephine remained on the committee until the campaign was successful, with the passing into law of the Married Women's Property Act 1882.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} vote of 2008, she placed {{third in the}} January 3 Iowa Democratic caucus behind Obama and Edwards. Obama gained ground in {{national}} polling {{in the next few}} days, with all polls predicting a victory for him in the New Hampshire primary. Clinton gained a surprise win there on January 8, defeating Obama narrowly. It was the first time <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection. Explanations for Clinton's New Hampshire comeback varied but often centered on her being seen more sympathetically, especially by women, after her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke while responding to a voter's question the day before the election.|$|E

5|$|At around 6a.m., {{a passing}} {{labourer}} saw women's items near a water-filled pit. One {{of the items}} was a woman's shoe with blood on it. He raised the alarm. He and others {{were able to use}} a rake to find a body in the pit– that of Mary Ashford. Two workers from a nearby factory found a series of footprints on the newly harrowed field near the pit, showing that a man and <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> travelled together, almost up to the pit, and that the man returned alone. Ashford was known to many of those who gathered around the pit, as was {{the fact that she had}} gone to Tyburn the previous evening. The local mill owner, who took charge, went to Tyburn to discover with whom Ashford had left the party. Daniel Clarke, the landlord, began to ride towards Castle Bromwich to try to locate Thornton, and encountered him almost at once. When Clarke told Thornton of Ashford's death, Thornton stated that he was with her until 4a.m., and at Clarke's request went with him to Tyburn.|$|E
5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} middle-class English family in Calcutta, British India, Murray divided her youth between India, Britain, and Germany, {{training}} {{as both a}} nurse and a social worker. Moving to London, in 1894 she began studying Egyptology at UCL, developing a friendship with department head Flinders Petrie, who encouraged her early academic publications and appointed her Junior Professor in 1898. In 1902–03 she took part in Petrie's excavations at Abydos, Egypt, there discovering the Osireion temple and the following season investigated the Saqqara cemetery, both of which established her reputation in Egyptology. Supplementing her UCL wage by giving public classes and lectures at the British Museum and Manchester Museum, {{it was at the}} latter in 1908 that she led the unwrapping of Khnum-nakht, one of the mummies recovered from the Tomb of the Two Brothers– the first time that <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> publicly unwrapped a mummy. Recognising that British Egyptomania reflected the existence of a widespread public interest in Ancient Egypt, Murray wrote several books on Egyptology targeted at a general audience.|$|E
5|$|When {{alerted to}} the {{possibility}} of Michael Farrar having been poisoned in the months before the fire, detectives investigated the origin of the castor beans that had led to police investigating the September domestic dispute. The label on the seed packets identified them as a product of the Earl May chain of stores. An officer found contact information for the Olathe, Kansas Earl May store in Green's address book. The detectives contacted nearby Earl May stores to find if any employees remembered selling castor beans, which are out of season in the fall. A clerk in Missouri recalled that in September <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> ordered ten packets of the out-of-season seeds and explained that she needed them for schoolwork. The clerk gave a description of the buyer that corresponded to Green, and tentatively identified her in a photo line-up as the buyer. Register tapes in the store's records showed that a purchase price corresponding to ten packets of castor beans had been rung up on either September 20 or 22. No records were found in any Earl May store of earlier such purchases that would have corresponded to Farrar first having become ill earlier in the year.|$|E

25|$|The {{centre of}} the mound {{contained}} an oak-built main chamber (Grave I), built on the original ground level. It measured 5.7 by 3.5 m and was circa 1 m high. This grave, containing a man and <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>had</b> already been plundered shortly after the burial. The remaining finds, reflecting its original riches include horse trappings, nearly 600 glass beads from a necklace, pieces of amber, and fine gold threads that were originally part of a brocade-like fabric. The floor had been covered with cowskins. A central mound, 5m high and 40 m in diameter covered this chamber.|$|E
25|$|Surviving {{accounts}} of the expedition differ on when Baret's gender was first discovered. According to Bougainville, rumors that Baret was <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> circulated for some time, but her gender was not finally confirmed until the expedition reached Tahiti in April 1768. As soon as she and Commerson landed on shore to botanize, Baret was immediately surrounded by Tahitians who cried {{out that she was}} a woman. It was necessary to return her to the ship to protect her from the excited Tahitians. Bougainville recorded this incident in his journal some weeks after it happened, when he had an opportunity to visit the Étoile to interview Baret personally.|$|E

25|$|Hillary Clinton was {{the winner}} of the popular vote in the primary, with Barack Obama {{trailing}} in second. Clinton's win was the first time <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> ever won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection. (Shirley Chisholm's prior win in New Jersey in 1972 was in a no-delegate-awarding, presidential preference ballot that the major candidates were not listed in and that the only other candidate who was listed had already withdrawn from; the actual delegate selection vote went to George McGovern.) However, Clinton and Obama received an equal number of delegates to the National Convention since the percentages of their votes were close.|$|E

She made her first impression at senior level two years later by winning the 3000 metres title at the French Athletics Championships – her run of 8:56.18 minutes was the first time <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> dipped under nine minutes at the competition. Her senior global debut followed at the 1987 World Championships in Athletics a month later and she placed 14th overall in the event. She ended that year with a win at the Cross Du Figaro.|$|E
25|$|The Colonial {{government}} {{meant to}} carry out its policy to establish an excellent secondary institution where teachers as well as students would be trained. The Legislative Council went on to approve the 1923–24 budget for the establishment of the Prince of Wales College and School, and in March 1924, Guggisberg laid the foundation stone. Rev. Alexander G. Fraser was the first Principal (1924–1935), and Dr. James Aggrey was the first Vice-Principal (1924–1927). Fraser had previously been Principal of Trinity College, Kandy, an elite school in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, and was hailed as the greatest colonial headmaster of his day by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Aggrey campaigned vigorously for women's education {{at a time when the}} idea was not popular, and held the belief that to educate a man was to educate an individual, while educating <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> more far-reaching benefits to family and community. This led to an increase in the number of places offered to girls by the College.|$|E

25|$|Robin, however, {{sensed the}} truth and killed her before leaving for the play. Then he planted the {{evidence}} and made the three calls {{to make it appear}} that <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> committed the crime. At this point he still had the photo, but rather than destroy it, he kept it and planted it at Mrs Summerhayes' house to incriminate her. But Poirot had gone through the drawer earlier and did not see the photo, so he knew it had been planted subsequently. Further revelations are also made. Eve Carpenter wanted to conceal her past for reasons of her own, which was why she didn't co-operate in the investigation. Poirot discovers that Dr Rendell may have killed his first wife, which led Mrs Rendell to talk about anonymous letters she'd received warning her of the fact. Poirot now suspects it was Dr Rendell, convinced that Poirot was in Broadhinny to investigate the death of his first wife, and not that of Mrs McGinty, who tried to push him under the oncoming train, not Robin. Maude Williams {{turns out to be the}} daughter of Eva Kane's lover, and has always believed that her mother was murdered by Eva and that her father took the blame. She came to see Mrs Upward, who she thought was Eva Kane, intending to confront her, but found her dead and left quietly. She admits this to Poirot, who agrees to keep it a secret and wishes her good luck in her life.|$|E
