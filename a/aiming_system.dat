5|$|The {{intention}} for {{the first}} few months of development was for the game to be an on-rails shooter similar to Sega's light gun game Virtua Cop; GoldenEyes gas plant location was modelled by Karl Hilton with a predetermined path in mind. Although GoldenEye is controlled with a pad rather than a light gun, Hollis credited Virtua Cop as an influence on the developers' adoption of features such as gun reloading, position-dependent hit reaction animations, penalties for killing innocent characters, and an alternative <b>aiming</b> <b>system</b> that is activated upon pressing the R button of the Nintendo 64 controller.|$|E
5|$|Based on the James Bond film, Rare's GoldenEye 007 was {{released}} in 1997, and as of 2004 it was the best-selling Nintendo 64 game in the United States. It was the first landmark console first-person shooter and was highly acclaimed for its atmospheric single-player levels and well designed multiplayer maps. It featured a sniper rifle, the ability to perform head-shots, and the incorporation of stealth elements; (and all these aspects were also used in the game's spiritual sequel Perfect Dark) as well as Virtua Cop-inspired features such as reloading, position-dependent hit reaction animations, penalties for killing innocents, and an <b>aiming</b> <b>system</b> allowing players to aim at a precise spot on the screen.|$|E
5|$|After GoldenEye 007 was released, Rare began {{development}} of a spiritual successor titled Perfect Dark. Using an upgraded version of the GoldenEye 007 game engine, Perfect Dark was released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64. Although the game features a setting and storyline unrelated to James Bond, it shares many gameplay features, including a similar control scheme, mission objectives that vary with the difficulty setting, and cheat options unlockable through quick level completions. While Perfect Dark was still in development, Martin Hollis left Rare {{to work as a}} consultant {{on the development of the}} GameCube at Nintendo of America. He would then form his own company, Zoonami, in 2000. Other members of the GoldenEye 007 team also left Rare to form Free Radical Design. The company would develop the TimeSplitters first-person shooters for the PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox. These games contain several references to GoldenEye 007, including the design of the health-HUD, the nature of the <b>aiming</b> <b>system,</b> and the dam setting of the opening level of TimeSplitters 2.|$|E

5|$|Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter with shoot 'em up and action-adventure elements, {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the player character from a third-person perspective in a 3D environment. The game places strong emphasis on shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. Weapons have no magazines restrictions and range from grenades to a pistol, a machine gun, a sniper rifle, a flamethrower, and rocket launchers, among others. Although much {{of the game is}} spent in battle, the player has the ability to jump, hang from most ledges, swim and fly using jet packs when needed. In combat, the player is free to set on a manual <b>aiming</b> <b>system</b> with the targeting camera fixed behind the character's head. When using this technique, a crosshair appears on screen and the player character becomes translucent so that players can aim and shoot with finesse. By contrast, when walking around, the game plays similar to a 3D platformer.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} of the health bar and other gameplay features are reminiscent of GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark. The game engine present in TimeSplitters 2 is also {{very similar to the}} one present in GoldenEye 007. They both contain a similar <b>aiming</b> <b>system</b> and both lack the ability to jump.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} criticised for some {{negative}} issues, {{such as the}} <b>aiming</b> <b>system</b> in gunplay. The developer had initially countered complaints that the game's aiming was inaccurate in a blog post on its official site. However, after complaints continued on the Naughty Dog forum and NeoGAF, a patch to address concerns about the game's <b>aiming</b> <b>system</b> was impending after developer Naughty Dog invited a couple of fans to its HQ to discuss the problem. On November 27, 2011, Naughty Dog released a patch that offered a fix for those unhappy with the game's refined aiming controls. The update offers the option of toggling between the new controls and a set-up {{more in line with}} that found in Uncharted 2. Despite being addressed in the previous games in the series, another minor issue raised was that of the game's linearity. Amy Hennig, in an interview with GameTrailers, defended this aspect by arguing that too little linearity in the series would have affected the game's narrative.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} years after 1901 the Model 1901's full {{potential}} could not be exploited {{due to a lack}} of effective <b>aiming</b> <b>systems.</b> The artillery pieces were delivered with open sights and could only be used for direct fire. New <b>aiming</b> <b>systems</b> were only introduced in 1911, when the field guns were modified at Kongsberg Armaments Factory and fitted with Goerz panoramic telescopes. This, together with other technical advances and the introduction of forward artillery observers, allowed effective indirect fire to be carried out.|$|R
25|$|By {{the late}} summer of 1943 it was clear the UBS was too great a {{challenge}} and could delay the entire program. At a 22 October meeting {{the decision was made}} to use a simplified bomb <b>aiming</b> <b>system</b> for the immediate future, with a radar operator calling information to the bombardier, who would use a simple mechanical calculator to time the drop. It was clear this was not satisfactory, but with no other option available in the short term, an order for 40 preproduction Eagle Mark I systems was placed for delivery in August 1944.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the game}} is based around third-person shooting, with the player able to wield a pistol, a magnum, a tommy gun, a shotgun, and a sniper rifle, as well as {{projectiles}} such as molotov cocktails and dynamite. The game features both a lock-on system and a manual <b>aiming</b> <b>system.</b> In the manual system, the player has complete freedom to aim wherever they wish. In the lock-on system, the player can lock onto a target, but still has a certain degree of freedom to aim manually; the targeting reticule can be moved around the locked on target, allowing the player to target specific areas. If the reticule turns red, the player has found a weak point. All enemies have four weak points - their two knees and their two shoulders. If the player shoots one of their knees, the enemy will {{no longer be able to}} run, but will continue to shoot back. If the player hits a shoulder, the enemy won't be able to fire back or fight.|$|E
500|$|Retrospective {{commentary}} on GoldenEye 007 {{in the years}} following its release included an October 2011 review by Mark Reece from NintendoLife. Reece gave the game a rating of eight out of ten, commenting that although the game's multiplayer mode stands up well, its graphics, audio and [...] "fiddly" [...] <b>aiming</b> <b>system</b> are dated. He noted that GoldenEye 007s approach to difficulty settings provides considerable replay value, but is a system rarely used in modern first-person shooters. On the game's original release, Edge awarded it a score of nine out of ten, but in 2013, with the benefit of hindsight, the magazine concluded that it should have received its highest score. In 2011, the game was selected as one of 80 titles from the past 40 years to be placed in the Art of Video Games exhibit in the Smithsonian American Art Museum.|$|E

500|$|Similar to Underworld, the new Tomb Raider {{features}} motion capture-based animation. In {{an effort}} to present realism and emotion in the character, Crystal Dynamics captured face and voice performances to accompany the body performances. The company plans to revamp Croft's in-game combat abilities. Crystal Dynamics aims to make the [...] "combat fresh to the franchise, competitive amongst , and relevant to the story." [...] Among the changes is {{the implementation of a}} free <b>aiming</b> <b>system.</b> The studio reasoned that such a system would cause players to be more invested in the action by fostering a [...] "raw, brutal, and desperate" [...] style. Global brand director Karl Stewart stated that such desperation relates to the updated character's inexperience with violence. He further commented that Lara Croft is thrust into a situation where she is forced to kill, which will be a traumatic and defining moment for her.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Perfect Dark was released, Rare {{planned to}} develop a [...] "sister" [...] title, called Velvet Dark, for either the Nintendo 64 or the Nintendo 64's successor, the GameCube, but the project was {{ultimately}} abandoned. The name [...] "Velvet Dark" [...] references Joanna Dark's alleged sister, who is the character players {{assume the role of}} in the game's co-operative mode. Meanwhile, Free Radical Design released TimeSplitters for the PlayStation 2 in October 2000, a first-person shooter based around a completely new engine. TimeSplitters bears several gameplay and presentational similarities to GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark, including a similar <b>aiming</b> <b>system</b> and unlockable options through quick level completions. After Rare was purchased by Microsoft in 2002, the company released a prequel, Perfect Dark Zero, as a launch title for the Xbox 360 in 2005. Although the game received generally positive reviews from critics, some publications felt it did not meet the expectations.|$|E
500|$|The Su-25T (Tankovy) is a {{dedicated}} antitank version, {{which has been}} combat-tested with notable success in Chechnya. The design of the aircraft {{is similar to the}} Su-25UB. The variant was converted to one-seater, with the rear seat replaced by additional avionics. [...] It has all-weather and night attack capability. In addition to the full arsenal of weapons of the standard Su-25, the Su-25T can employ the KAB-500Kr TV-guided bomb and the semi-active laser-guided Kh-25ML. [...] Its enlarged nosecone houses the Shkval optical TV and <b>aiming</b> <b>system</b> with the Prichal laser rangefinder and target designator. It can also carry Vikhr laser-guided, tube-launched missiles, which is its main antitank armament. For night operations, the low-light TV Merkuriy pod system can be carried under the fuselage. Three Su-25Ts prototypes were built in 1983–86 and 8 production aircraft were built in 1990. With the introduction of a definitive Russian Air Force Su-25 upgrade programme, in the form of Stroyevoy Modernizirovannyi, the Su-25T programme was officially canceled in 2000.|$|E

5000|$|Patricia Gimbel, {{the dean}} of admissions for Deerfield Academy, a private {{university}} preparatory school in Massachusetts, said in 2005 that AIPCS had [...] "taken kids who are not the brightest and propelled them {{to the top of}} state standards." [...] Betty Olson-Jones, the president of the Oakland Education Association, the teachers' union of the Oakland schools, said that the <b>AIM</b> <b>system</b> [...] "had a reputation among the local public schools as being very interested in kind of recruiting kids who are going to do well, and getting rid of kids who won't." [...] Ben Chavis and Janet Roberts, a school principal in the <b>AIM</b> <b>system,</b> said that this was not true.|$|R
50|$|First {{proposed}} in the 1970s, AIM {{was designed to maximize}} the efficiency of the curriculum development process through the use of computer-based automation tools. Currently, over 300,000 hours of the Navy's instructional materials exist utilizing the <b>AIM</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
500|$|Although {{music and}} sound effects were kept from the {{original}} recording sessions, original master recordings {{have been used to}} update the soundtrack at much higher quality; the original recording size was 16MB, while in the remaster it is over 250MB. Developers also decided to retain the free aim mode because they wanted to be faithful to the original game. According to Rare's Producer Nick Ferguson, [...] "We didn't change the fundamental behavior of the <b>aiming</b> <b>system</b> simply because that is not how Perfect Dark was played". He also observed that the idea of updating the controls was actually seen as a flaw in Perfect Dark Zero, which tried to [...] "combine the original Perfect Dark system with aspects of Halo". The original diagonal running, which allows players to move faster than by running forwards or sideways alone, did not work the first time they implemented the analog stick, so it was manually rewritten as it was considered essential for speedruns and achieving some of the target times required to unlock cheats.|$|E
500|$|Just Cause 2 action {{elements}} were widely praised. Ryan Davis of Giant Bomb praised {{the game for}} its defiance of physics, increasing player enjoyment. The combined grappling hook and parachute was praised for facilitating and enhancing traversal and exploration. Eurogamer Parkin agreed, adding that the tool was a mix of Spider-Man and Bionic Commando, but Game Informer Marchiafava thought that the mechanic and its precision exceeded both. He praised the action stunts, especially skydiving (which he called [...] "thrilling"). VanOrd described the stunts as [...] "satisfying", [...] "silly", [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "crazy", and stated that travelling between locations was so enjoyable that players would rarely use the black marketeer. Clements praised Avalanche Studios for providing action only found in a [...] "top-dollar Hollywood production" [...] with the game's stunts. Parkin and Neigher commended its potential, with Parkin writing that players use their imagination to experiment with the grappling hook (making the game addictive). However, its gunplay (particularly the <b>aiming</b> <b>system)</b> was criticized. The game's difficulty and artificial intelligence were criticized as frustrating, as they sometimes spawned {{in front of the}} player. According to Clements and Marchiafava, its controls had a steep learning curve.|$|E
2500|$|Ghostbusters: The Video Game was {{met with}} a {{generally}} positive reception. Greg Miller of IGN gave both the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions an 8.0 out of 10. Miller describes the game as a [...] "love letter to Ghostbusters fans", saying that it [...] "makes {{you feel like you}} are really a Ghostbuster". He lauds the CGI cutscenes as a positive feature, but finds fault with stiff character animation and bad lip sync in the other cutscenes. Miller gave the Wii version a 7.8 out of 10. Unlike Miller, fellow reviewer Matt Casamassina believed that the <b>aiming</b> <b>system</b> in Ghostbusters was better than the <b>aiming</b> <b>system</b> in Resident Evil 4. PSM3 gave the game a score of 85 out of 100, stating that the game was [...] "too short, but packed with quality and imagination." [...] The A.V. Club gave the game a B-, concluding that [...] "It’s the best Ghostbusters game of all time, though that really isn’t saying much." [...] Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot rated the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of the game a 7.5 out of 10, listing the ghost-trapping gameplay and multiplayer mode as positives and frustrating spots in the game and repetitive gameplay as negatives. He also reviewed the Wii version and gave it an 8 out of 10 stating that [...] "Ghostbusters is such riotous fun that you'll forgive its short length." ...|$|E

2500|$|Much of {{the game}} is based around third-person shooting, with the player able to wield a [...]38 snub nose, a pistol, a magnum, a Tommy gun, and a shotgun, as well as {{projectiles}} such as Molotov cocktails and dynamite. The game features both a lock-on system and a manual <b>aiming</b> <b>system.</b> In the manual system, the players have complete freedom to aim wherever they wish. In the lock-on system, when the player locks a target, a targeting reticule appears on-screen. The longer the player is locked on, the smaller the reticule gets, allowing for more precise aiming. Within the lock-on system, the player also has a certain degree of freedom to aim manually; the reticule can be moved around the locked on target, allowing the player to target specific areas. If the reticule turns red, the player has found a weak point. All enemies have five weak points: their two knees and their two shoulders, plus their groin. If the player shoots one of their knees, the enemy will {{no longer be able to}} run, but will continue to shoot back. If the player hits a shoulder, the enemy won't be able to fire back or fight. Hitting the groin accomplishes the same effect as a knee shot, also stunning the target.|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} first shown at an EA press event on July 13, 2006. Designer Mike Olsen {{explained}} the 360 version [...] "is 100% {{of the game}} on the Xbox, plus some." [...] Graphically, the game features dynamic weather and diurnal cycles, and an enhanced particle system. All of the rackets feature new textures and geographical layouts, so they no longer all look the same, {{and each of the}} rival family compounds is completely different, with bomb locations different from compound to compound. The game also features new lighting and particle effects. In terms of gameplay, the game adds a favor system whereby rather than intimidating shop owners, the player can carry out favors for them. The player can also carry out favors for family members, {{in much the same way}} as they can carry out hits. A major addition to the game is the ability for the player to hire Corleone soldiers to join Aldo in combat. This can involve individually hiring a single family member, or hiring a crew of four men who accompany the player everywhere until they are dismissed or killed. Individual crew members cost different amounts, but the more expensive they are, the better they fight. A full crew can only be hired periodically; when a meter on the HUD is full. The game also features new story missions, such as rescuing Tom Hagen from Sollozzo, bombing Sollozzo's drug factories, and assassinating Moe Greene. The <b>aiming</b> <b>system</b> has also been tweaked, and the melee combat system has had additional combat moves added. Twenty-six new execution styles have also been added to the twenty-two existing ones.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>AIM</b> <b>system</b> was {{established}} in 2007, expanding to an additional two charter schools: another middle school and a high school.
