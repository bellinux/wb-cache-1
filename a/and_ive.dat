60|$|THE BISHOP. No. Edith has {{no sense}} of humor. <b>And</b> <b>Ive</b> never seen {{a man in a}} jocular mood on his wedding morning.|$|E
60|$|SIR PATRICK. I {{could have}} told you that. Ive tried these modern inoculations a bit myself. Ive killed people with them; <b>and</b> <b>Ive</b> cured people with them; but I gave them up because I never could tell which I was going to do.|$|E
60|$|PERCIVAL. Havnt {{even looked}} at him. I'm {{trying to make}} a club record with a passenger. The club {{supplied}} the passenger. He just got in; <b>and</b> <b>Ive</b> been too busy handling the aeroplane to look at him. I havnt said a word to him; and I cant answer for him socially; but hes an ideal passenger for a flyer. He saved me from a smash.|$|E

60|$|JOHNNY. [deeply hurt] It's twenty-seven years, mother, {{since you}} had that row with me for licking Robert and giving Hypatia a black eye because she bit me. I promised you then that I'd never raise my hand {{to one of them}} again; <b>and</b> <b>Ive</b> never broken my word. And now because this young whelp begins to cry out before he's hurt, you treat me as if I were a brute and a savage.|$|E
6000|$|THE BISHOP [musing] I {{wonder who}} will begin the stand against marriage. It must come some day. I was married myself before I'd thought about it; {{and even if}} I had thought about it I was too much in love with Alice to let {{anything}} stand in the way. But, you know, Ive seen one of our daughters after another--Ethel, Jane, Fanny, and Christina and Florence--go out at that door in their veils and orange blossoms; <b>and</b> <b>Ive</b> always wondered whether theyd have gone quietly if theyd known what they were doing. Ive a horrible misgiving about that pamphlet. All progress means war with Society. Heaven forbid that Edith {{should be one of}} the combatants! ...|$|E
60|$|WALPOLE. It amuses me to {{hear you}} {{physicians}} and general practitioners talking about clinical experience. What do you see at the bedside but {{the outside of the}} patient? Well: it isnt his outside thats wrong, except perhaps in skin cases. What you want is a daily familiarity with people's insides; and that you can only get at the operating table. I know what I'm talking about: Ive been a surgeon and a consultant for twenty years; <b>and</b> <b>Ive</b> never known a general practitioner right in his diagnosis yet. Bring them a perfectly simple case; and they diagnose cancer, and arthritis, and appendicitis, and every other itis, when any really experienced surgeon can see that it's a plain case of blood-poisoning.|$|E

60|$|DORA. Only fancy! {{he stopped}} {{to laugh at the}} copper! He thought the copper would see the joke, poor lamb. He was arguing about it when the two that took me came along {{to find out what the}} whistle was for, and brought me with them. Of course I swore I'd never seen him before in my life; but there he was in my hat and I in his. The cops were very spiteful and laid it on for all they were worth: drunk and disorderly and assaulting the police and all that. I got {{fourteen}} days without the option, because you see--well, the fact is, I'd done it before, and been warned. Bobby was a first offender and had the option; but the dear boy had no money left and wouldnt give you away by telling his name; and anyhow he couldnt have brought himself to buy himself off and leave me there; so hes doing his time. Well, it was two forty shillingses; <b>and</b> <b>Ive</b> only twenty-eight shillings in the world. If I pawn my clothes I shant be able to earn any more. So I cant pay the fine and get him out; but if youll stand 3 pounds I'll stand one; and thatll do it. If youd like to be very kind and nice you could pay the lot; but I cant deny that it was my fault; so I wont press you.|$|E
