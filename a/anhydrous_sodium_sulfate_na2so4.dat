40|$|Different drying {{procedures}} for XAD- 2 resin (air-drying, oven-drying and drying under nitrogen steam) and glass fiber filters, GFFs (chemical drying with <b>anhydrous</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> and freeze-drying) were applied and their unfluence studied {{with respect to}} the final percentages of recovery of 13 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) included in the European list of pollutants. The subsequent extraction of PAHs was achieved using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) followed by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry analysis (GC-MS). The best drying procedure for spiked XAD- 2 resin was found to be drying under nitrogen steam.

The grooved terrain is brighter and has a more icy composition than the dark terrain. The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the Galileo spacecraft and from Earth observations has revealed various non-water materials: carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and, possibly, cyanogen, hydrogen sulfate and various organic compounds.

40|$|Borax {{has been}} {{identified}} as a possible crystallization modifier for <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate.</b> Understanding the effect of borax on factors influencing transport and crystallization kinetics of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> helps to clarify how this modifier might limit crystallization damage. It has been observed that the addition of borax to <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> solutions has no influence on the wetting properties (contact angle on glass, surface tension, or evaporation rate) and therefore will not influence solution transport. Additionally, the influence of borax on the crystallization kinetics of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> was studied under controlled environmental conditions. This was carried out in mixtures in glass microcapillaries, and sequentially in droplets on glass plates. Under the here studied precipitation conditions, the addition of borax has no influence on the supersaturation ratio at the onset of crystallization, but it significantly affects the crystallization pattern of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> crystals (thenardite). Using RAMAN spectroscopy, two different hydrates of borax were identified after precipitation, depending on the initial concentration of the solution. Each hydrate has a different effect on the subsequent crystallization of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate.</b> The decahydrate polymorph of borax leads to the precipitation of hydrated <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> crystals (mirabilite) and the pentahydrate form favors the precipitation of the <b>anhydrous</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> crystals (thenardite) with an altered crystal habit. Using X-ray diffraction, overdevelopment of the (111), (131), (222) and (153) faces of thenardite was identified. Additionally, the ratios between several peaks are reversed.
