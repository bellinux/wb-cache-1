5|$|Eglin steel uses a {{combination}} of over a dozen different elements in varying amounts to create a relatively low-cost steel for use in bunker buster weapons. Hadfield steel (after Sir Robert Hadfield) or manganese steel contains 12–14% manganese which when abraded strain-hardens to form <b>an</b> <b>incredibly</b> hard skin which resists wearing. Examples include tank tracks, bulldozer blade edges and cutting blades on the jaws of life.|$|E
5|$|Over about 80 million years, erosion {{caused the}} {{transportation}} of {{massive amounts of}} alluvial sediment {{to the floor of}} the Central Valley, where it was trapped between the California Coast Range on the west and the Sierra Nevada on the east, forming <b>an</b> <b>incredibly</b> flat and fertile land surface. The present-day form of the upper Merced River watershed, however, was formed by glaciers, and the lower watershed was indirectly but significantly affected.|$|E

5|$|Barkley was a {{prolific}} scorer who averaged 22.1 points-per-game {{during the regular}} season for his career and 23.0 points-per-game in the playoffs for his career. Barkley was <b>an</b> <b>incredibly</b> efficient offensive force, leading the NBA in 2-point field goal percentage every season from the 1986–87 season to the 1990–91 season. He led the league in effective field goal percentage in both the 1986–87 and 1987–88 seasons as well, and also led the league in offensive rating in both the 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons. He was one of the NBA's most versatile players and accurate scorers capable of scoring from anywhere on the court and established himself as one of the NBA's premier clutch players. During his NBA career, Barkley was a constant mismatch because he possessed a set of very uncommon skills and could play in a variety of positions. He would use all facets of his game in a single play; as a scorer, he had the ability to score from the perimeter and the post, using an array of spin moves and fadeaways, or finishing a fast break with a powerful dunk. He {{was one of the most}} efficient scorers of all-time, scoring at 54.13% total field goal percentage for his season career and 51.34% total field goal shooting for his playoff career (including a career-high season average of 60% during the 1989–90 NBA season).|$|E
5|$|As a junior, Watts {{played in}} the forward line as a strong-marking tall and was an {{accurate}} shot on goal. Regarded as <b>an</b> <b>incredibly</b> quick player for his height, especially over the first twenty metres, his speed and athleticism saw him dominate in the forward line as a junior. After struggling to replicate his form from the juniors in the AFL, he was trialled as a defender in 2011 by then senior-coach, Dean Bailey, playing primarily as the loose man in defence. Bailey intended on using him as both a defender and forward; he recognised Watts {{would not be the}} main key forward at the club, which was intended when he was drafted, but when playing in the forward line, he would instead be used as a floating forward. He played a new role in 2012 under Mark Neeld in defence, where he was highly praised for his ability to read the play and take intercept marks. He played in defence for the duration of Neeld's tenure, until Neeld was sacked and replaced by Neil Craig in the middle of 2013 with Craig electing to return Watts to the forward line. After playing in the forward line and in defence, incoming coach in 2014, Paul Roos, saw an opportunity for Watts to play in the midfield due to his body size and elite kicking, in addition to the club needing an influx of midfielders. After the desperate need for midfielders dissipated, Watts returned to a half-forward role in the middle of 2014; he played as a half-forward throughout Roos' coaching term and was used as a back-up ruckman in 2016.|$|E

40|$|In recent day’s Multilevel {{inverter}} (MLI) technologies become <b>a</b> <b>incredibly</b> main {{choice in}} the area of high power medium voltage energy control. Though multilevel inverter has a number of advantages it has drawbacks in the vein of higher levels because of using more number of semiconductor switches. This may leads to vast size and price of the inverter is very high. So in order to overcome this problem the new multilevel inverter is proposed with reduced number of switches. The proposed method is well suited for a high power application and it built with three Dc sources and six Switches. Multi carrier pwm technique is used for sine wave generation. The results are validated through the harmonic spectrum of the FFT window by using Matlab/simulink. The result of the proposed MLI is compared with the conventional MLI and other seven level existing topologies...|$|R
