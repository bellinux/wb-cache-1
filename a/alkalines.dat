2500|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that the huge supply of agricultural cellulose, the lignocellulosic material {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "Nature's polymer", would be an ideal source of material for biofuels and many other products.

Still currently only in pilot stage, this promising technology offers the possibility that any agricultural economy might be able to get rid of its requirement to refine oil for transportation fuels. This would be a major improvement in carbon neutral energy sources and allow the continued use of internal combustion engines on a large scale.|$|E

While the <b>alkaline</b> α-amylase gains increased industrial interest, the yield of <b>alkaline</b> α-amylases from wild-type microbes is low, and the combination of genetic engineering and process optimization is necessary to achieve the overproduction of <b>alkaline</b> α-amylase. Results The <b>alkaline</b> α-amylase gene from Bacillus alcalophilus JN 21 (CCTCC NO. M 2011229) was cloned and expressed in Bacillus subtilis strain WB 600 with vector pMA 5. The recombinant <b>alkaline</b> α-amylase was stable at pH from 7. 0 to 11. 0 and temperature below 40 °C. The optimum pH and temperature of <b>alkaline</b> α-amylase was 9. 0 and 50 °C, respectively. Using soluble starch as the substrate, the K m and V max of <b>alkaline</b> α-amylase were 9. 64 g/L and 0. 80 g/(L·min), respectively. The effects of medium compositions (starch, peptone, and soybean meal) and temperature on the recombinant production of <b>alkaline</b> α-amylase in B. subtilis were investigated. Under the optimal conditions (starch concentration 0. 6 % (w/v), peptone concentration 1. 45 % (w/v), soybean meal concentration 1. 3 % (w/v), and temperature 37 °C), the highest yield of <b>alkaline</b> α-amylase reached 415 U/mL.

40|$|Introduction: Laboratory and {{clinical}} data have implicated endotoxin {{as an important}} factor in the inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass. We assessed the effects of the administration of bovine intestinal <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase (bIAP), an endotoxin detoxifier, on <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase levels in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Methods: A total of 63 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were enrolled and prospectively randomized. Bovine intestinal <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase (n= 32) or placebo (n= 31) was administered as an intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion for 36 hours. The primary endpoint was to evaluate <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase levels in both groups and to find out if administration of bIAP to patients undergoing CABG would lead to endogenous <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase release. Results: No significant adverse effects were identified in either group. In all the 32 patients of the bIAP-treated group, we found an initial rise of plasma <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase levels due to bolus administration (464. 27 +/- 176. 17 IU/L). A significant increase of plasma <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase at 4 - 6 hours postoperatively was observed (354. 97 +/- 95. 00 IU/L) as well.
