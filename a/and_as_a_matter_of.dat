5|$|When the War of the Austrian Succession started, Winterfeldt {{was sent}} {{on a mission}} to St. Petersburg, which, however, failed. He then {{commanded}} a grenadier battalion with great distinction at the Battle of Mollwitz, and won further glory in the celebrated minor combat of Rothschloss, where the Prussian hussars defeated the Austrians on 17 May 1741. One month later, Winterfeldt was made a colonel, as also was Zieten, the cavalry leader who had actually commanded at Rothschloss; the latter, as the older in years and service, resented the rapid promotion of his junior. After this promotion, Frederick chiefly employed Winterfeldt as a confidential staff officer to represent his views to the generals, a position in which Winterfeldt needed extraordinary tact and knowledge of men and affairs, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> course made many enemies.|$|E

25|$|In real {{materials}} the Lorentz {{force is}} inadequate {{to describe the}} collective behavior of charged particles, both in principle <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> computation. The charged particles in a material medium not only respond to the E and B fields but also generate these fields. Complex transport equations must be solved to determine the time and spatial response of charges, for example, the Boltzmann equation or the Fokker–Planck equation or the Navier–Stokes equations. For example, see magnetohydrodynamics, fluid dynamics, electrohydrodynamics, superconductivity, stellar evolution. An entire physical apparatus for dealing with these matters has developed. See for example, Green–Kubo relations and Green's function (many-body theory).|$|E

25|$|The NYSE {{trades in}} a {{continuous}} auction format, where traders can execute stock transactions on behalf of investors. They will gather around the appropriate post where a specialist broker, who is employed by a NYSE member firm (that is, he/she is not {{an employee of the}} New York Stock Exchange), acts as an auctioneer in an open outcry auction market environment to bring buyers and sellers together and to manage the actual auction. They do on occasion (approximately 10% of the time) facilitate the trades by committing their own capital <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> course disseminate information to the crowd that helps to bring buyers and sellers together. The auction process moved toward automation in 1995 through the use of wireless hand held computers (HHC). The system enabled traders to receive and execute orders electronically via wireless transmission. On September 25, 1995, NYSE member Michael Einersen, who designed and developed this system, executed 1000 shares of IBM through this HHC ending a 203-year process of paper transactions and ushering in an era of automated trading.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} a tachyonization of the ΛCDM {{model for a}} {{spatially}} flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker space-time is proposed. A tachyon field and a cosmological constant are considered as {{the sources of the}} gravitational field. Starting from a stability analysis and from the exact solutions for a standard tachyon field driven by a given potential, the search for a large set of cosmological models which contain the ΛCDM model is investigated. By the use of internal transformations two new kinds of tachyon fields are derived from the standard tachyon field, namely, a complementary and a phantom tachyon fields. Numerical solutions for the three kinds of tachyon fields are determined and it is shown that the standard and complementary tachyon fields reproduces the ΛCDM model <b>as</b> <b>a</b> limiting case. The standard tachyon field can also describe a transition from an accelerated to a decelerated regime, behaving <b>as</b> <b>an</b> inflaton field at early times <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> field at late times. The complementary tachyon field always behaves <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> field. The phantom tachyon field is characterized by a rapid expansion where its energy density increases with time.
