5|$|All-weather {{lifeboats}} (ALBs) {{are large}} boats with enclosed wheelhouses and survivor spaces below deck, which are self-righting and {{can go out}} in all weather conditions.

The RNLI's aim {{is to provide a}} 25-knot lifeboat to every all-weather crew, and has begun construction of an All-weather Lifeboat Centre (ALC) in Poole which, when complete, will save £3million <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> <b>The</b> RNLI took over the ALC in 2015 with the expectation of becoming fully operational in 2019, when six Shannon-class lifeboats a year will be built.|$|E

5|$|As {{in other}} ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although {{generally}} similar to adults, newborn calves have false eyelashes, a long dorsal mane and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and {{give way to}} the general appearance within <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> <b>The</b> juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. The growth rate of calves is appreciably high in {{the first few months of}} birth, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months. Horn development in males takes one year after birth. The okapi's average lifespan is 20 to 30 years.|$|E

5|$|As {{the figures}} {{given in the}} table above were {{published}} before the turbines had been operational for a full year they are projected rather than recorded figures. Wind speed is not constant, therefore, a wind farm's annual energy production never achieves {{the sum of the}} generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> <b>The</b> ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors are 20–40%, with values at {{the upper end of the}} range achieved on particularly favourable sites. The expected capacity factor for Scout Moor Wind Farm, calculated from the company's projected figures, is 27%. The actual capacity factor calculated from data published by OFGEM for June 2016 to May 2017 was 25.20%.|$|E

This book, as well as being a tribute to the explorer, was a practical effort to assist his family; Shackleton died some £40,000 in debt (2011: £1.6 million). A further initiative was the establishment of a Shackleton Memorial Fund, which was used to assist the education of his children and the support of his mother.|$|E
