40|$|Cobalt is {{recognized}} as a strategic metal and also E-tech element, which is crucial for worlds development. An increasing demand for cobalt forces for searching of new resources that could be explored in European countries. There are many examples of cobalt recoveries, mostly from laterite and sulphide deposits. However, the accurate choice of the technology depends on many factors. The Kupferschiefer stratiform copper ore located in Poland is the biggest deposit of cobalt in Europe. Although KGHM Polska Miedz S. A. recovers many precious metals from this ore, cobalt is not recovered yet. This metal occurs as an <b>accompanying</b> <b>element,</b> mostly {{in the form of}} cobaltite (CaAsS), with the average content of 50 – 80 g/Mg.

40|$|After {{responding}} to each element in varying, successive numerosity displays, pigeons (Columba livia) had to choose, {{out of an}} array of symbols, the symbol designated to correspond to the preceding number of elements. After extensive training, 5 pigeons responded with significant accuracy to the numerosities I to 4, and 2 pigeons to the numerosities I to 5. Several tests showed that feedback tones <b>accompanying</b> <b>element</b> pecks, the familiarity of element configurations, and {{the shape of the}} elements were not crucial to this performance. One test, however, indicated that the number of pecks issued to the elements was important for numerosities above 2. An additional test confirmed that the birds chose the, symbol that corresponded to a particular numerosity rather than the positions that the symbols had held during training. Numerical abilities in animals have attracted the interest of students of behavior since early on, not least because they were thought to represent evolutionary antecedents of human nonverbal counting abilities (Butterworth, 1999; Dehaene, 1997). Several avian and mammalian species have accordingly been examined with a variety of numerical tasks (e. g., Boysen, 1993; Davis & Albert, 1986; Davis & Perusse, 1988; Koehler, 1949; see Rilling, 1993, for an overview).

40|$|In {{the four}} early modern revenge tragedies I study, Thomas Kyd’s The Spanish Tragedy, William Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus, Thomas Middleton’s The Revenger’s Tragedy, and John Webster’s The Duchess of Malfi, the {{ubiquitous}} depictions of corporeal violence underscore the authors’ skepticism {{of the human}} tendency to infuse bodies – physical manifestations of both agency and vulnerability – with symbolism. The revengers in these plays try to avenge {{the death of a}} loved one whose disfigured body remains unburied and often continues to occupy a place on stage, but their efforts to infuse corpses with meaning instead reveal the revengers’ perverse obsession with mutilation as spectacle. In Chapter one, I show how in The Spanish Tragedy Thomas Kyd portrays the characters’ assertions of body-soul unity to be arbitrary attempts to justify self-serving motives. Although Hieronimo treats Horatio’s dead body as a signifier of his own emotions, he displays it, alongside the bodies of his enemies, as just another rotting corpse. In Chapter two, I explore how in Titus Andronicus, William Shakespeare questions the efficacy of rituals for maintaining social order by depicting how the play’s characters manipulate rituals intended to celebrate peace as opportunities to exact vengeance; Titus demands human sacrifice as not just an <b>accompanying</b> <b>element,</b> but a central motive of rituals ostensibly intended to signify commemoration. In Chapter three, I read The Revenger’s Tragedy as illustrating Thomas Middleton’s characterization of the depiction of corporeal mutilation as an overused, generic convention; the play’s revenger, Vindice, attributes multiple, constantly shifting, meanings to the rotting skull of his lover, which he uses as a murder weapon. In Chapter four I argue that in The Duchess of Malfi, John Webster destabilizes spectators’ interpretive capacities; within this play’s unconventional dramatic structure, the main characters use somatic imagery to associate bodily dismemberment with moral disintegration. Corpses, the tangible remains of once vigorous, able-bodied relatives, serve as central components of respectful commemoration or as mementos of vengeance, yet these dead, often gruesomely mutilated bodies also invite repulsion or perverse curiosity. Thus, rather than honoring the deceased, revengers objectify corpses as frightening spectacles or even use them as weapons...|$|E

40|$|Platinum group metals (PGMs) have {{received}} much {{attention in the}} fields of industry, geochemistry and medicine. Due to scarcity of PGMs and their high industrial demands, recycling of PGM bearing materials such as industrial wastes, automobile catalytic converters and similar products gained much attention in recent times. Particularly, separation of PGMs as a group from the material bearing the elements followed by their individual separation is crucial. In this study, an attempt was made to develop chromatographic method for separation of individual PGMs (platinum, palladium and rhodium) that are the main constituents of automobile catalytic converters. Anion-exchange chromatography (with mineral acid and organic aqueous solvent containing complexing reagent) and reverse-phase ion-pair chromatography were tried. Rhodium was successfully separated from the other PGMs by using SAX-HPLC, but separation of platinum and palladium was not satisfactory by the tested methods. The main problem lies in a lack of specific detector such as ICP-MS during the time of study. As a result of this, the focus of the method development switched to solid phase extraction (SPE) technique, in which the effluent from the sorbent is easily collected and analyzed by more suitable detector, ICP-OES. Individual separation of PGMs and their separation as a group from <b>accompanying</b> <b>elements</b> (such as aluminum, chromium, copper and iron) were conducted using different SPE sorbents (SCX-SPE, SAX-SPE, CN-SPE and RP-SPE modified with DOS,) by off-line SPE procedures. The separated analytes from all methods were analysed using ICP-OES. The results from different SPE analysis were compared and discussed. In addition, an attempt was made to recover the retained PGMs from the SPE sorbents using both HCl and HNO 3 solutions and percent recovery was calculated. None of the PGMs were retained by SCX-SPE sorbent, but 70, 70, 72 and 66 % of aluminum, iron, chromium and copper was retained respectively. However, it was found that PGMs (except rhodium) were strongly retained on SAX-SPE from dilute HCl, while all <b>accompanying</b> <b>elements</b> did not show any marked retention. Recovery of retained platinum and palladium was also investigated using 1 - 6 M HCl and HNO 3. Nevertheless, both platinum and palladium could not be recovered from SAX-SPE sorbent. Selective separation of palladium from other PGMs and <b>accompanying</b> <b>elements</b> and its quantitative desorption by using 3 M HCl solutions was also achieved using CN-SPE sorbent. SPE sorbents modified with 0. 19, 0. 39 and 0. 58 mmol of DOS were studied and compared with regard to their application for separation and recovery of palladium from platinum and rhodium in a medium of HCl solutions. Quantitative retention of palladium was established with 0. 58 mmol of DOS. However, recovery of palladium from DOS impregnated RP-SPE sorbent was not successful by using HCl and HNO 3 of different concentrations. In the case of platinum and rhodium, the retention was insignificant...|$|R

40|$|Hydrometallurgical {{processing}} of a Vietnamese chromite ore was attained through oxidative leaching in highly concentrated KOH aqueous solution {{in the presence}} of compressed air at 300 degrees C under atmospheric pressure. Followed by diluting with fresh water or dilute KOH aqueous solution, the leaching process achieved the salting-out of hexavalent chromium in the form of K 2 CrO 4 crystal due to the relatively low solubility of hexavalent chromium in concentrated KOH aqueous solution. The difference in particle size and bulk density enabled the effective separation of the obtained K 2 CrO 4 crystal and the chromite ore leaching residue through gravity sedimentation. During the leaching process, other <b>accompanying</b> <b>elements</b> such as aluminum and silicon were extracted out from the chromite ore as well. However, their leaching products easily formed a compound of potassium aluminosilicate and therefore precipitated into the leaching residue.
