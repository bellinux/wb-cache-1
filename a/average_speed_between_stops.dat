It is backed by local organisations like municipalities. It has several lines that can be considered independently, but at its greatest extent it will include the major cities of Bergen, Kristiansand, Stavanger, Trondheim and Ålesund with a hub in Oslo. In addition {{there will also be}} a line through the Vestfold region and lines both west and east of the Mjøsa lake. This project will however need political support before it can be started. Norsk Bane has criticised the VWI investigation mainly because it did not prioritise railways to Hordaland and Møre og Romsdal. Norsk Bane has been criticised because they assume 250 km/h <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> (<b>between</b> <b>stops)</b> at 250 km/h cruise speed and assuming 2:30 travel time Oslo-Trondheim including seven stops (490 km). This is not possible even on a double track railway.|$|E
40|$|Transit travel time, {{operating}} speed and reliability all influence service attractiveness, operating cost and system efficiency. These metrics {{have a long-term}} impact on system effectiveness through a change in ridership. As part of its bus dispatch system (BDS), the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon (TriMet) has been archiving automatic vehicle location (AVL) and automatic passenger count (APC) data for all bus trips at the stop level since 1997. In 2014, a new and higher-resolution bus AVL data collection system was fully implemented. This new AVL system provides stop-level data as well as five-second resolution (5 -SR) bus position data between stops. Rather than relying on interpolation tools to estimate bus trajectories (including stops and delays) between stops, the higher-resolution data shows more precise bus positions along each trip. Bus travel speeds and intersection signal/queuing delays may be determined using this newer information of several variables on transit travel time. This research project explored potential applications of the new data for assessing transit performance, and for estimating transportation system performance measures for urban streets and arterials. Results suggest that the 5 -SR data provides high-resolution time and position information {{which can be used}} to determine bus travel speeds between stops, identify speed breakdowns, and estimate intersection signal/queuing delays. Additionally, high-resolution achieved bus data can be used to visualize sources of congestion and delay on urban arterials. A new inter-stop trip time model was developed using the five-second resolution data. This newly developed model resulted in statistically significant and improved results over previous models. The models for overall travel time indicated that dwell time and <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> <b>between</b> <b>stops</b> were the major factors influencing transit travel time. Hence, it was concluded that estimation of <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> <b>between</b> <b>stops</b> is a critical component of the transit trip time models. Using this 5 -SR data in the trip time model led to more precise and statistically valid trip time models. The research provides conclusions that can be used by transit agencies to improve operations through improvements such as transit signal priority. More importantly, for transit agencies looking for ways to archive data the research provides recommendations on formatting the data that can be most useful for future analysis...|$|E
40|$|Transit {{travel time}} and {{operating}} speed influence service attractiveness, operating cost, system efficiency and sustainability. The Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon (TriMet) provides public transportation {{service in the}} tri-county Portland metropolitan area. TriMet {{was one of the}} first transit agencies to implement a Bus Dispatch System (BDS) as a part of its overall service control and management system. TriMet has had the foresight to fully archive the BDS automatic vehicle location and automatic passenger count data for all bus trips at the stop level since 1997. More recently, the BDS system was upgraded to provide stop-level data plus 5 -second resolution bus positions <b>between</b> <b>stops.</b> Rather than relying on prediction tools to determine bus trajectories (including <b>stops</b> and delays) <b>between</b> <b>stops,</b> the higher resolution data presents actual bus positions along each trip. Bus travel speeds and intersection signal/queuing delays may be determined using this newer information. This thesis examines the potential applications of higher resolution transit operations data for a bus route in Portland, Oregon, TriMet Route 14. BDS and 5 -second resolution data from all trips during the month of October 2014 are used to determine the impacts and evaluate candidate trip time models. Comparisons are drawn between models and some conclusions are drawn regarding the utility of the higher resolution transit data. In previous research inter-stop models were developed based on the use of <b>average</b> or maximum <b>speed</b> <b>between</b> <b>stops.</b> We know that this does not represent realistic conditions of stopping at a signal/crosswalk or traffic congestion along the link. A new inter-stop trip time model is developed using the 5 -second resolution data to determine the number of signals encountered by the bus along the route. The variability in inter-stop time is likely due to the effect of the delay superimposed by signals encountered. This newly developed model resulted in statistically significant results. This type of information is important to transit agencies looking to improve bus running times and reliability. These results, the benefits of archiving higher resolution data to understand bus movement <b>between</b> <b>stops,</b> and future research opportunities are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{cinematic}} and physiological requirements of referees and assistant referees and their relationship to decision-making in various official competition matches in football.

The registration of the data of the subjects participating in the study was conducted with an inertial system called WIMU and the analysis of the data was performed with a software called Quiko (RealTrack Systems, Almeria, Spain). In the study, 4 games of the League Championship Third Division (Group XIII) belonging to the 2014 - 2015 season were analyzed. The main findings were that the referee runs an average distance of 10124. 7 ± 543. 2 meters, with an <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> <b>between</b> 7. 2 and 13 km/h with a maximum heart rate (HRmax) between 85 - 95 % of his maximum; assistant referees walked an average distance of 5793. 4 ± 481. 7 meters, with an <b>average</b> <b>speed</b> <b>between</b> 3. 6 to 7. 2 km/h with a HRmax between 75 - 85 % of their maximum. The aspects which influenced the decision making of the referees and caused the errors were: the part of the pitch, the period of play and the HRmax percentage of the referee. What this research shows is that referees and assistant referees should be considered in terms of training as independent people, and that referees must correct the movements in the field, concentration and work situations where your HRmax is above 85 % to improve its success rate.
