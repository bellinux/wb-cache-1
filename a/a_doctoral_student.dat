5|$|Rabi chaired Columbia's physics {{department}} from 1945 to 1949, {{during which}} time it was home to two Nobel laureates (Rabi and Enrico Fermi) and eleven future laureates, including seven faculty (Polykarp Kusch, Willis Lamb, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, James Rainwater, Norman Ramsey, Charles Townes and Hideki Yukawa), a research scientist (Aage Bohr), a visiting professor (Hans Bethe), <b>a</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>student</b> (Leon Lederman) and an undergraduate (Leon Cooper). Martin L. Perl, <b>a</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>student</b> of Rabi's, won the Nobel Prize in 1995. When Columbia created the rank of University Professor in 1964, Rabi {{was the first to}} receive such a chair. This meant that he was free to research or teach whatever he chose. He retired from teaching in 1967 but remained active in the department and held the title of University Professor Emeritus until his death. A special chair was named after him in 1985.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>student</b> of Curie, Marguerite Perey, {{became the}} first woman elected to {{membership}} in the Academy– over half a century later, in 1962. Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia—the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair–which also fueled false speculation that Curie was Jewish. During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right wing press who criticised her for being a foreigner and an atheist. Her daughter later remarked on the public hypocrisy as the French press often portrayed Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but would portray her as a French hero when she received a foreign one such as her Nobel Prizes.|$|E

25|$|Hawking's {{first year}} as <b>a</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>student</b> was difficult. He was {{initially}} disappointed to find {{that he had been}} assigned Dennis William Sciama, {{one of the founders of}} modern cosmology, as a supervisor rather than noted astronomer Fred Hoyle, and he found his training in mathematics inadequate for work in general relativity and cosmology. After being diagnosed with motor neurone disease, Hawking fell into a depressionthough his doctors advised that he continue with his studies, he felt there was little point. However, his disease progressed more slowly than doctors had predicted. Although Hawking had difficulty walking unsupported, and his speech was almost unintelligible, an initial diagnosis that he had only two years to live proved unfounded. With Sciama's encouragement, he returned to his work. Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of Fred Hoyle and his student Jayant Narlikar at a lecture in June 1964.|$|E
25|$|Clark then {{registered}} as <b>a</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>student,</b> being awarded a Hugo de Balsham studentship at Peterhouse from 1930 to 1932, {{and then a}} Bye Fellowship from 1932 to 1935. At Burkitt's suggestion, he devoted his thesis largely to the Mesolithic—or 'Middle Stone Age'—period of British prehistory. At the time little was known about Mesolithic Britain as few scholars had paid attention to it, {{and most of the}} archaeological evidence for it consisted of scattered flint tools. Burkitt served as his supervisor, although largely left Clark to his own devices. Clark initially familiarised himself with the evidence for Mesolithic society in continental Europe by travelling to Denmark and Sweden in 1929, where he had a chance meeting with Sophus Müller. On his return to Britain he began a systematic examination of Mesolithic stone tool collections that were held in both museums and private collections across the country, listing these many artefacts within a database. From this he was able to map the distribution of such Mesolithic tool assemblages across the island.|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. April 2011. Major: Work and Human Resource Education. Advisor: James M. Brown, Ph. D. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 151 pages, appendices A-C. This qualitative case study explored {{the experiences of}} <b>doctoral</b> <b>students</b> at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities as they transitioned from a fairly stable academic department experiencing significant changes. To achieve {{the purpose of the}} study, I investigated the experiences of <b>doctoral</b> <b>students</b> through <b>an</b> organizational development perspective and analyzed how they themselves interpret changes. This study attempted to expand research to include a conceptual foundation for organizational change, identify how departmental changes affect <b>doctoral</b> <b>students,</b> and strategies for an academic department transformation. Perceptions from <b>doctoral</b> <b>students</b> and document data as back up were seen as essential in furthering the understanding of organizational changes in higher education. Using the interpretive case study methodology of Michael Quinn Patton, I devised a conceptual foundation for organizational change in an academic department about the core elements of doctoral students' needs during transition for continued progress toward degree completion. A missing link within and among the core elements would alter or impair <b>a</b> <b>doctoral</b> <b>student's</b> experiences and advancement toward degree completion. In the end, what continued to be an important stronghold for them before the transformation and then following the merger of the department remained critical. These <b>doctoral</b> <b>students</b> needed communications, considered the faculty relationships necessary, and looked for a sense of community. What was presented to and arranged for them caught them by surprise. Findings yielded <b>an</b> analysis of <b>doctoral</b> <b>student</b> unlike any mentioned in the literature...|$|R
