This paper reports on formative research conducted in Scotland to inform the development of an awareness-raising campaign on the issue of dementia, which had two key aims: to raise awareness of the condition among the general public, and to reduce the stigma associated with it. Social marketing consumer research was conducted with three key groups [...] the general public, carers and people with dementia [...] to explore their beliefs and perceptions about dementia and their information needs.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{worldwide}} growth of open-access (OA) repositories, December 2005 to December 2012, using {{data collected by}} the OpenDOAR project. It shows that initial repository development was focused on North America, Western Europe and Australasia, particularly the USA, UK, Germany and Australia. Soon after, Japan increased its repository numbers. Since 2010, other geographical areas and countries have seen repository growth, including East Asia (especially Taiwan), South America (especially Brazil) and Eastern Europe (especially Poland). During the whole period, countries such as France, Italy and Spain have maintained steady growth, whereas countries such as China and Russia have experienced relatively low levels of growth. Globally, repositories are predominantly institutional, multidisciplinary and English-language-based. They typically use open-source OAI-compliant repository software but remain immature in terms of explicit licensing arrangements. Whilst the size of repositories is difficult to assess accurately, the available data indicate that {{a small number of}} large repositories and a large number of small repositories make up the repository landscape. These trends and characteristics are analyzed using Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT) building on previous studies. IDT is shown to provide a useful explanatory framework for understanding repository adoption at various levels: global, national, organizational and individual. Major factors affecting both the initial development of repositories and their take up by users are identified, including IT infrastructure, language, cultural factors, policy initiatives, <b>awareness-raising</b> <b>activity</b> and usage mandates. It is argued that mandates in particular are likely to {{play a crucial role in}} determining future repository development...|$|R

40|$|This {{article has}} a dual aim. First, the author reports on how two {{techniques}} were used from personal construct psychology, dyadic elicitation and laddering (Fransella, Bell & Bannister, 2004 : 27 - 34, 39 - 43) {{to raise a}} cohort of prospective teachers’ awareness of their classroom-related constructs (N = 21). Second, the process for elicitation of the constructs depended on the trainees’ {{ability to deal with}} the cognitive and the social-interactive demands of the elicitation tasks. These demands were enacted in a discursive process which conversation analysts refer to as ‘sequential organisation’; in addition, participants followed the rules that govern sequence organisation typical of the interview (Schegloff, 2007 : 231). Using 12 random combinations of 10 classroom-based scenarios, which served as elements for the elicitation process, the researcher elicited approximately 800 constructs from the group of prospective teachers. A matrix-based summary of 48 constructs elicited from 10 teacher-trainees for the first scenario combination are presented. In addition, how one of the teachers responded to the full range of scenario-based elements is outlined briefly. The conclusion is drawn that the attaching of verbal labels to their meaning-making constituted deliberate and conscious thinking by prospective teachers about their experience, which is typical of <b>awareness-raising</b> <b>activity.</b> Moreover, the social-interactive demands of this interview type, requiring the prospective teachers to follow the rules of interaction in this context to explore and label their personally held constructs, served to reinforce the awareness-raising process. A further conclusion was that the matrix-based analysis was contentious: Although students may use the same labels to refer to a construct, the meanings they attach to those labels may vary...|$|R

40|$|Children {{and young}} people have {{a high level of}} {{awareness}} of cybersafety risks and the key messages for staying safe online. This ACMA report found that 75 per cent of children surveyed claim they know not to give out their address or phone number online and remember key safety messages such as ‘people aren’t always who they say they are online’. ‘Australian children are telling us the internet is part of their everyday lives, and as they approach high school, it’s increasingly important to their social lives. Up to 97 per cent of 16 to 17 year olds claim to use at least one social networking service,’ said Chris Chapman, Chairman of the ACMA. Most young people are using online technologies as a way to connect with their real world friends, with a small proportion— 17 per cent of 12 to 17 year olds—using online social networking to build networks of new friends.  The report highlights an ongoing need for cybersafety material that resonates with young people, as well an improved flow of cybersafety information to parents.   DOWNLOAD OPTIONS The research was conducted in two parts—a qualitative phase and a quantitative phase. 	 01 : Qualitative research report  (PDF 2. 1 mb or Word 1. 7 mb) 	 02 : Quantitative research report  (PDF 3. 6 mb or Word 2 mb)   Report 2 ̆ 7 s key findings General internet use 	As children age they spend more time online. 	 		Children aged 8 to 9 years use the internet for an average of 1 hour, 6 mins every two days. 		Young people aged 16 to 17 years average 3 hours, 30 mins on the internet every day. 	 	 	Younger children are more interested in individual activities online, such as playing games— 83 per cent of 8 to 11 year-olds reported online gaming as the most popular use of the internet 	By comparison, young people aged 12 to 17 use the internet mainly for social interaction— 81 per cent of 12 to 17 year olds nominated social networking services as their main reason for going online. Social Networking Services Social networking services refer to online services where ‘members’ can chat with each other via instant messaging, email, video or voice chat, share photos and videos and post comments in online forums or blogs. 	Young people, aged 12 to 17, have a very high level of use of social networking services. 	 		Approximately 97 per cent of 16 to 17 year olds surveyed reported using {{at least one of these}} services, compared to 51 per cent of children aged 8 to 11 years. 	 	 	Fifty four per cent of 12 to 17 year olds claim that ‘chatting to friends from school’ is their main reason for using social networking services. 	 		By comparison, only 17 per cent of 12 to 17 year olds claim to use the internet to ‘make new friends’. 	 	 Awareness of risks associated with use of internet and social networking services 	Children {{and young people}} have a high awareness of cybersafety risks and identify activities such as ‘posting personal information’ as high risk behaviour. 	The tendency toward risky behaviour rises with age. Of those aged 16 to 17 years: 	 		Sixty-one per cent report accepting ‘friend requests’ from people they don’t know offline. 		Seventy-eight per cent claim to have personal information, such as a photograph of themselves, on their social networking profile pages, compared to 48 per cent of 8 to 9 year olds. 	 	 Parents’ knowledge of cybersafety risks, and communication with children 	Parents report communicating ‘frequently’ with their children about internet use and the risks associated with stranger contact. 	As children age, parents report less active monitoring of their internet use 	Outside of their parents, children are likely to go to their siblings to discuss cybersafety issues. Young people aged 12 to 17 years are most likely to go to another friend for advice. 	Parents claim a relatively high knowledge of their children’s behaviour online, especially when their child is among the younger age groups. Cyberbullying 	The experience of cyberbullying increases with age. Cyberbullying is experienced by just one per cent of 8 to 9 year olds, but 19 percent of 16 to 17 year olds surveyed. 	 		Seventy-two per cent of those surveyed told their parents about the bullying 		Fifty per cent knew how to block the bully’s messages. 	 	 	Less than 10 per cent of children and young people surveyed admitted any involvement in cyberbullying another person.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{instruction}} delivered via a learner-centered, self-access website on the learning of expressions of gratitude by L 2 Chinese learners across proficiency levels. Three research questions are addressed: (1) whether the web-based instruction facilitates students 2 ̆ 7 learning of Chinese expressions of gratitude, (2) whether {{the effects of}} instruction vary across proficiency levels, and (3) how L 2 learners regard {{the use of the}} website as a learning tool. Based on the noticing hypothesis and the pragmatic consciousness-raising approach, a pragmatics website was developed that provided explicit instruction on how to appropriately express gratitude in Chinese and offered <b>awareness-raising</b> exercises and <b>activities</b> for practice. It was structured in eight instructional units and two review sessions. To address the three research questions, this study adopted a pretest-posttest design to include two groups of learners who differed in their proficiency in the Chinese language. The two groups of learners received pragmatics instruction delivered via the self-access website over five weeks. Two weeks prior to the instruction, all learners were asked to complete (1) the language contact profile (LCP) for eliciting their demographic information and their contact with Chinese outside the classroom, (2) a local standardized Chinese proficiency test (CPT) for assessing their proficiency in Chinese, (3) discourse completion tasks/tests (DCT) for soliciting their production of Chinese expressions of gratitude, (4) metapragmatic assessment tasks (MAT) for eliciting their metapragmatic assessment of thanking responses provided, and (5) retrospective interviews for soliciting learners 2 ̆ 7 explanations of their assessments in the MAT. On a weekly basis during the treatment period, learners wrote reflective e-journals in response to prompt questions provided by the researcher, which helped track learners 2 ̆ 7 self-access study progress and their on-going perceptions of the website. One week after the online instruction, all learners were also asked to complete the same types of questionnaires (i. e., the DCT and the MAT) and retrospective interviews for assessing their pragmatic development. Results showed that after receiving the web-based instruction, all learners produced more appropriate expressions of gratitude and used more varied thanking strategies in their responses, regardless of their proficiency. Learners 2 ̆ 7 assessments of Chinese expressions of gratitude became more target-like and their metapragmatic awareness was also promoted. However, higher-level learners seemed to have benefited more from the instruction in their production of Chinese expressions of gratitude than lower-level participants, and the higher-level group demonstrated an overall higher level of pragmatic awareness than the lower-level group after the online instruction. But no significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of learners 2 ̆ 7 metapragmatic assessments. In addition, participants responded positively to the website and put forward constructive suggestions to improve it. Finally, this study interpreted the findings based on cognitive processing theories, proposed both theoretical and pedagogical implications, and discussed the limitations of this study and directions for future research...|$|R

The project team consisted of members from DoCs, The Office of the Minister, The national Transport and Logistics Centre (TALC), the University of New South Wales (UNSW), the NSW Commission for Children and Young People (CCYP), the NSW Youth Advisory Council and Small World: Social Media Experts (a social networking and new media company). Stakeholders’ consist of the commissioning bodies, the project team and the young people in the regions identified. The aims of the pilot project were to: Explore how online social networking technologies can be used to engage young people aged 9 - 18 to better inform NSW government decision making Use the NSW Better Futures programme framework in the Central Coast and North Coast NSW regions of DoCS as the focus for the pilot project to see if and how young people would engage in making decisions about expenditure in their local areas under the framework Propose a list of projects selected by young people in Central Cost and North Coast NSW for funding by the program. The pilot involved a field study in the two regions which took place from mid January to the end of April 2009. It was conducted in both electronic and physical spaces in six phases, beginning with face-to-face interviews with young people to gain insight into potential areas in which the proposal money could be used and to learn about their online behaviour patterns. From this information a short list of proposals was developed. The short list comprised of five areas young people viewed as important: 1) environmental issues such as <b>awareness-raising</b> and <b>activities</b> such as planting more trees, 2) provision of spaces for young people to hang out, 3) provision of skate, surf and BMX competitions and workshops, 4) access to sporting equipment and 5) under 18 music events with local bands and artists. An interactive online game was designed to encourage young people to express their preferences on the proposals in the short list. A “viral” campaign was then developed and implemented to attract young people in the regions to the game and to encourage them to vote. By experimenting with different engagement strategies – that integrated the use of a website, digital media, social media sites such as MySpace, Bebo, and YouTube, blog and forums, local radio, TV and school newsletters announcements – the pilot project attracted and motivated young people to express their preferences about youth projects to be funded by DoCS in the “Better Futures” program (for 9 - 18 years old) in the two targeted regions. In two months (mid February until mid April 2009) 8, 200 “friends” were created; there were approximately 70 visitors per day to the website and 2, 026 young people voted for the nominated projects. Learning from the project included: - That young people will engage with NSW government decision making through social networking sites - That overall all young people in both regions voted for music events as their first preference. - That only the MySpace poll was able to identify the regional affiliation of voters. IP addresses and other geographic screening mechanisms were not as effective as anticipated. The MySpace poll indicated that there were regional differences with the second and third choices in the North Coast being places for young people to hang out and expenditure on environmental issues and the second and third preferences from the Central Coast were sporting competitions and equipment. - As participation and voting occurred largely in response to activity generated in the targeted areas by the campaign it is likely that voting or any other participation from young people outside the areas targeted is extremely low. - That further development of voting instruments and other participatory tools is required to enable deeper analysis of the ranking of votes and the geographic location of participants. The pilot project was deemed to be very successful by the majority of project team as much was learned which will inform the development of future youth online participation projects. Young people were attracted participate through their social networking sites and engaged in decision making via interviews, online comments and various voting tools. The trial was able to indicate that music events were the most popular of the projects proposed and the MySpace tool was able to identify regional differences for second and third preferences.

40|$|Executive summary In September 2015, the Scottish Government {{commissioned}} a 10 month study {{to better understand}} forced marriage in Scotland. This is the first forced marriage study that focuses exclusively on Scotland. The study had three research questions: What is the level and profile of service use relating to forced marriage in Scotland? How are services responding to forced marriage in Scotland? What {{is the impact of}} the interventions for forced marriage in Scotland? Methods The study focussed on six areas: Aberdeen, Dundee, East Renfrewshire, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Highland. An analysis of forced marriage policy in each of the six case study areas was undertaken, together with interviews with Protection Leads. One-to-one semi-structured interviews were carried out with a range of professionals including police officers, social workers, legal professionals and staff from Women's Aid organisations and other third sector organisations. Eight in-depth interviews were also conducted with survivors[1] of forced marriage. Additionally, a survey was distributed to 293 organisations - schools and women's organisations in the six study areas, and Women's Aid, minority ethnic and other support organisations throughout Scotland. Key findings and recommendations Level and profile of service use Between 2011 and 2014, there were 191 cases[2] of forced marriage reported by survey respondents, with a fairly even spread across the years. Cases tended to involve young, female South Asian victims being threatened or coerced into marriage largely by their parents and extended families. Age and ethnicity were unknown for around a quarter and a fifth of cases respectively, indicating that better recording of cases is necessary. Of the cases where age was known, the majority of victims were aged 18 - 25, with under 18 s representing around a quarter of cases and under 16 s around 1 in 10 of cases. Victims were mainly from Pakistani backgrounds (more than half of cases where ethnicity was known), followed by 'other ethnicity', Indian and Black African. Just over a half of referrals {{came to the attention of}} services through referral from other organisations, with under a third self-referrals and the remainder referred by friends or family. The interviews with the eight survivors of forced marriage echo the survey findings. The age range of when the forced marriage occurred was from 14 - 25. For five of the eight survivors the forced marriage was contracted with one survivor being forced into marriage twice. For two of the eight women, the experience of forced marriage was recent or ongoing (within the last two years). All the survivors interviewed were South Asian. All the women received help only when they came to Scotland - whether from abroad or another of the UK nations. Responding to forced marriage in Scotland Of the professionals interviewed, the majority had little direct experience of dealing with forced marriage but showed a sound understanding of forced marriage. However, those with direct experience of supporting victims of forced marriage had a deeper and more insightful understanding of forced marriage as a process rather than an 'event'. This was reflected at a policy level where there were differing levels of ownership and maturity of forced marriage policy, and where learning from forced marriage cases was identified as a means of improving responsiveness. Most professionals were aware that forced marriage took place in a range of communities, but it was seen as largely affecting South Asian communities in Scotland. This perception was confirmed by the survey findings, which found that the majority of cases where ethnicity was recorded related to South Asian communities. In both the policy analysis element of the study and in interviews with professionals, participants drew heavily from the Scottish Government's multi-agency guidance on forced marriage. A wide range of interventions are currently offered to support victims of forced marriage, most commonly one-to-one support, central to which is risk assessment and safety planning. Person-centred approaches were often used, and the need for therapeutic and practical support was also highlighted. Two third sector agencies interviewed offered mediation (and they were of the opinion that this was an effective intervention), despite the fact that Scottish multi-agency guidance stipulates that mediation should not be attempted in forced marriage cases. In terms of the outcome of support offered, nearly half of survey respondents reported that support offered was effective, but a further third were unsure whether the support offered was effective. Reported barriers to responding to forced marriage included 'race anxiety'; a need for more robust local authority procedures for supporting adult victims of forced marriage who have capacity (i. e. who do not meet the criteria to trigger access to adult protection); a need for further regular training for professionals; and a need for increased community education/public awareness on forced marriage. Multi-agency working was discussed both as very positive but also as a barrier - due to competing priorities and processes, with some agencies having more power than others to intervene and not always utilising the expertise available via specialists. A lack of training and learning opportunities on forced marriage was also identified as a barrier to responding effectively to forced marriage, despite forced marriage training being widely available. The survey results, policy analysis in some areas and interviews with some professionals suggest that a number of agencies and areas do not consider forced marriage a relevant issue for their organisation. This indicates that even with the provision of increased training on forced marriage, it might be challenging to recruit professionals to attend. Community education was thought to be a way to raise awareness within communities to increase reporting, but this intervention can also serve as a preventive measure. Targeted interventions for different sections of communities e. g. young people and elders would need to be developed. Although there was wide publicity about the forced marriage legislation, a lack of public awareness of forced marriage was also cited as a major barrier to increasing reporting and providing support for victims. This links with survivors' accounts that they sought help from family and friends and feared contacting agencies due to perceived confidentiality issues, family pressure, uncertainty about the appropriateness of response, and uncertainty about whether what had or was happening to them warranted agency involvement. There are examples of good practice at both a policy and practice level, including meaningful connections between child and adult protection leads and violence against women leads in some areas, proactive learning, person-centred support and in-depth expertise on forced marriage. Survivors reported that they had received excellent support from third sector organisations, but their accounts of other agencies were more mixed. Impact of interventions There was widespread support for civil remedies for dealing with Forced Marriage, from professionals interviewed and survivors of forced marriage. A number of issues were identified with regard to the implementation of civil remedies, relating to: a lack of consensus about what constitutes 'sufficient' evidence to justify granting a Forced Marriage Protection Order the onus of responsibility being placed on the victim, particularly where the victim is an adult who does not meet the criteria for accessing adult protection confidentiality of the victim not always being maintained In relation to criminalisation, most professionals interviewed thought it sent a strong message to the public that forced marriage was unacceptable in Scotland. However, a number of professionals (including some who supported criminalisation) also raised concerns about the potential for forced marriage to 'go underground', as victims would not wish to criminalise their families. It is too early to say whether this concern is justified. All survivors welcomed legal protection, but most were not supportive of criminalisation. However, one survivor who had pursued an FMPO stated that criminal procedures should be used, but only as a last resort. The impact of forced marriage on survivors of forced marriage included suicidal ideation, self-harm, eating disorders and other mental health problems. Survivors were frequently denied educational opportunities, impacting on their future careers and earning capacity. On a more positive note, survivors' experiences of forced marriage had engendered within them more liberal attitudes to parenting than those that they had experienced from their own parents. Survivors' experiences of statutory service response, including recent responses in Scotland, although positive in places, was patchy. However, it should be noted that some of the women were reflecting on historic cases stretching back a couple of decades and, at times, referring to experiences that happened outside Scotland. Most of the women had had some contact with third sector specialist women's support organisations, and all reported this as an extremely positive experience, although it should be noted that most survivors were recruited through their engagement with the women's sector. For some of the women, this was the first time they had told their story; for all of them it was the first time they had received support. Recommendations 1. Develop an innovative programme of further public/community <b>awareness-raising</b> <b>activity,</b> to prevent forced marriage and to encourage increased reporting 2. Develop further regular training on forced marriage for a range of professionals (including teachers, social workers, police officers, legal professionals and mental health practitioners), and ensure appropriate staff attend and the learning is cascaded and applied 3. Support the continued development of specialist women's sector organisations 4. Support the development of forced marriage policy in local authority areas, in order to increase ownership and consistency of approach at a local policy level throughout Scotland 5. Ensure that therapeutic and practical support is available to victims of forced marriage 6. Evaluate forced marriage interventions to develop better understandings of what types of forced marriage interventions work for whom 7. Address the issues the research identified in relation to implementing forced marriage legislation 8. Strengthen the statutory guidance of the Forced Marriage etc. (Protection and Jurisdiction) (Scotland) Act (2011) to make explicit local authorities' obligations to act in all cases of Forced Marriage 9.

However, the benefits of these techniques do not extend to the retention, production or interpretation of metaphors. These are important skills that could help language learners {{in their use of}} metaphor in the real world. This thesis focuses on the embodied nature of L 2 metaphors through <b>awareness-raising</b> <b>activities</b> that incorporate bodily actions and tactile contact. Through four experimental classroom studies with university-level female EFL Saudi learners, this thesis explores the impacts of employing <b>awareness-raising</b> <b>activities</b> of conceptual metaphors and embodied metaphors. The first and second studies compare conceptual metaphor awareness to traditional semantic clustering and highlight the role of conceptual metaphor awareness in understanding metaphoric expressions. The third study introduces embodied metaphor <b>awareness-raising</b> <b>activities</b> through bodily actions and compares them to conceptual metaphor awareness and semantic clustering. The fourth study explores the benefits of using embodied tactile metaphor <b>awareness-raising</b> <b>activities</b> in the learning of linguistic and pictorial metaphors in advertising.
