The analysis {{made on the}} basis of 56 cycles scaling Borås test of <b>air-entrained</b> <b>concretes.</b> The levels of water-binder ratio (w/b) : 0. 45 and 0. 38, the partial replacement of cement with fly ash (0, 20, 35, 50 % mass of cement), and kind of siliceous fly ash in three categories of loss on ignition A, B and C were variable in concrete mixes. The results show that apart from air-entraining, which was the sufficient condition to ensure freeze-thaw resistance, also the lowest value of water-binder ratio is necessarily to ensure de-icing salt scaling resistance of fly ash concretes.

40|$|Abstract. Salt frost scaling is the {{progressive}} {{deterioration of the}} concrete surface associated with freezing and thawing {{in the presence of}} a salt solution. Its major mechanism has been confirmed to be cryogenic suction that promotes continuous ice growth in the surface region. In this paper, salt frost scaling of different <b>air-entrained</b> <b>concretes</b> is investigated, alone with the room-temperature sorptivity measurement. A clear correlation is found between the two properties, which is supported by a theoretical analysis on the sorptivity.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{damaging}} actions affecting concrete is the abrupt temperature change (freeze-thaw cycles). The types of deterioration of concrete structures by cyclic freeze-thaw can be largely classified into surface scaling (characterized by the weight loss) and internal crack growth (characterized {{by the loss of}} dynamic modulus of elasticity). The present study explored the durability of concrete made with air-entraining agent subjected to 0, 100, 200, 300, and 400 cycles of freeze-thaw. The experimental study of C 20, C 25, C 30, C 40, and C 50 <b>air-entrained</b> <b>concrete</b> specimens was completed according to “the test method of long-term and durability on ordinary concrete” GB/T 50082 - 2009. The dynamic modulus of elasticity and weight loss of specimens were measured after different cycles of freeze-thaw. The influence of freeze-thaw cycles on the relative dynamic modulus of elasticity and weight loss was analyzed. The findings showed that the dynamic modulus of elasticity and weight decreased as the freeze-thaw cycles were repeated.

40|$|The {{deicing salt}} scaling {{resistance}} {{has been investigated}} for two types of concrete, i. e., air entrained high-volume fly ash (HVFA) concrete with a 50 % cement replacement and non-air entrained concrete containing superabsorbent polymers (SAPs). A full characterization of their air void systems {{from the moment of}} casting until the freeze/thaw test was also done. Due to the presence of the highly AEA adsorptive fly ash an increased AEA dosage (7. 0 ml/kg binder) was needed to achieve an adequate air void system in terms of air content and spacing factor to keep salt scaling within acceptable limits. For the novel non-air entrained concrete type with SAPs, which are able to absorb up to 500 times their weight in fluids, the salt scaling resistance is surprisingly high. The microstructural analysis revealed the formation of macro-pores due to these SAPs, creating an air void system as can be found in <b>air-entrained</b> <b>concrete.</b> Another advantage is that the strength of concrete with SAPs is much higher than for a conventional <b>air-entrained</b> <b>concrete.</b> This substantiates the further use of these SAPs as admixture in precast concrete road elements...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA new {{description}} is proposed {{of the air}} void structure in <b>air-entrained</b> <b>concretes</b> using a PPV (Protected Paste Volume) parameter. The PPV is determined as a ratio of the paste area protected by air voids to the total paste area, obtained from the 2 D surface measurements. This approach, although constitutes a development of the Philleo concept, {{takes into account the}} number, size and distribution of not only air voids but also aggregate grains, often disregarded by other researchers. The obtained results show that the standard spacing factor L⩽ 0. 20 mm fails to guarantee that 100 percent of the paste volume is protected against the harmful effects of frost, which is the basic assumption in the Powers spacing factor model. The preliminary verification was carried out of the relationships between the parameters L and PPV and the results of freeze–thaw experiments. According to the authors, {{at this stage of the}} study the PPV provides better correlation with the frost resistance results than the standard spacing factor L. Unlike other indicators representing a statistical estimation of the average spacing of air bubbles, the PPV much better reflects the spatial displacement of the air pores in concrete and can thus be considered as an improved factor of air voids spatial dispersion...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{number of}} air voids, {{their size and}} {{disposition}} in cement paste,are important characteristics, which substantially affect the system of air voids that protects concrete from freezing and thawing cycles. The standard spacing factor L {{is based on the}} simplified Powers model, which assumes that all bubbles have the same diameter and are distributed in cube corners. A better solution is provided by Philleo, which determines the percentage content of protected paste (S*). The authors’ approach consists in determining the PPV factor, which is based on the concept of Philleo, and takes into account not onlythe actual structure of air voids, butalso of aggregate grains, which is often disregarded in analyses. In this article the results of analyzing the air void structure in <b>air-entrained</b> <b>concrete</b> on the basis on 2 D image analysis are presented. Implementation of this research was possible thanks to the use of a special procedure of concrete samples preparation. Such an approach allows the separation of 4  phases of concrete: aggregate, cement paste, rings of the paste protected by air voids and air. The PPV results obtained from image analysis were compared with standard spacing factor L and with Philleo factor (S*).

This thesis presents the results of research performed in developing high-volume fly ash (HVFA) concrete incorporating ASTM Type I cement and ASTM Class F fly ash from Big Brown Power Plant of TU Electric, Texas. In HVFA concrete, the proportion of fly ash was 58 percent by weight of the total cementitious materials, the water and cement content were kept low at 115 and 155 k g/M 3, respectively. A broad range of engineering properties was investigated including compressive strength, flexural strength, splitting-tensile strength, Young's modulus of elasticity, drying shrinkage, resistance to freeze-thaw cycling, pore structure and activation energy. A preliminary economic analysis was also performed on HVFA concrete. The HVFA concrete evaluated in this study had satisfactory workability and setting characteristics. It also exhibited excellent mechanical properties with satisfactory early age strength and good long-term strength development. The HVFA concrete had relatively low drying shrinkage and a very fine pore system. Excellent durability under freeze-thaw cycling was also found for the <b>air-entrained</b> HVFA <b>concrete.</b> Results from activation energy test show that strength gain of the HVFA concrete under isothermal curing conditions could be modeled appropriately using Plowman's logarithmic strength-age model.

40|$|Rail seat {{deterioration}} (RSD) {{is considered}} the most critical problem with concrete-tie performance on North American freight railroads. RSD is {{the deterioration of the}} concrete underneath the rail that results in problems such as wide gauge, insufficient rail cant, and loss of fastening toe load. Currently, the problem is not sufficiently understood to enable development of effective solutions. The primary causes of RSD appear to be high stresses at the rail seat, a loosened fastening system, the presence of moisture, and the presence of abrasive fines. RSD is considered to have up to six potential mechanisms, and this research investigates three of them: hydraulic pressure cracking, hydro-abrasive erosion, and cavitation erosion. A laboratory test apparatus and procedure were devised to measure the surface water pressure in a laboratory rail seat using tie pads of differing material composition and surface geometry. To evaluate hydraulic pressure cracking, a model of the effective stress in a concrete-tie rail seat was developed to estimate the water pressures on the rail seat surface and whether they could lead to damaging pore pressures in the concrete. Comparing the effective stress model and the measured surface water pressures, hydraulic pressure cracking appears to be a feasible mechanism for RSD given the correct combination of high rail seat loads, sufficient moisture, and a tie pad surface that develops high pressure. The measured surface water pressures were used to estimate the potential water velocity. By comparing these estimates with critical velocities for concrete erosion, it appears feasible that hydro-abrasive erosion contributes to RSD. The uplift action of the rail was simulated in the test apparatus, and the resulting suction was at or near the vapor pressure of water for most of the tie pads considered, suggesting that cavitation occurs in a concrete-tie rail seat. However, considering the size of the cavitation bubbles that could fit underneath the tie pad, and the observation that no high collapse pressures were measured, cavitation erosion is not a feasible mechanism for RSD. Mitigation options for preventing hydraulic pressure cracking are using a tie pad or pad assembly that does not seal water, reducing the occurrence of high impact loads, and using high-strength, <b>air-entrained,</b> low-permeability <b>concrete.</b> Care should be exercised when using pads that do not seal water, as this could contribute to hydro-abrasive erosion or abrasion...|$|R

The research also showed that granulated rubber leads to concrete with lower thermal conductivity, and that concrete with low U-values, suitable for use in floors and foundations, can be produced without the need for complementary insulation.

The model is evaluated experimentally through acoustic emission analysis under freeze-thaw cyclic loading, which reveals that <b>air-entrained</b> <b>concrete</b> may undergo durability cracking (D-cracking) if deleterious materials are present. It is determined that high-porosity, low-permeability aggregates with fine pore structure are the most vulnerable to D-cracking in non-air-entrained concrete, and the destructive tensile stress is generated at the aggregate boundary by the Mandel-Cryer effect. On the other hand, low-porosity, high-permeability aggregates relax the pore liquid pressure rapidly and prove to be beneficial for the non-air-entrained concrete.

40|$|For many decades, {{degradation}} of concrete by freezing actions {{has been a}} primary interest of research for civil engineers. Past studies mostly relied on expensive and time-consuming experimental or semi-empirical investigations to identify the source of damage that is attributable to substandard aggregates, inadequate entrained air content, highly porous mortar or cement matrix, and use of deicing salts. Theoretical works developed in recent years do not incorporate all these factors in one single model. Very recently, concrete has gained widespread popularity as a cheap alternative to traditional material utilized for containing liquefied natural gas (LNG). Most studies documenting concrete behavior at cryogenic temperatures are obscure. Therefore, poroelastic theory, capable of incorporating aggregate and mortar properties, pore solution characteristics, air void spacing, and environmental exposure has been utilized to model damage triggering stresses and strain in concrete used for two purposes: 1) concrete pavement exposed to freezing and thawing cycles, and 2) concrete walled tanks containing LNG. The solid-liquid phase transformation equilibrium has been redeveloped to demonstrate the effect of pore solution speciation and disjoining pressure on the deformation of freezing concrete. The modeled trends are in good agreement with experimental results obtained from literature. It {{has been found that}} the damage initiating tensile stresses, exhibited at the aggregate-matrix boundary for both the <b>air-entrained</b> and non-air-entrained <b>concrete</b> can be exacerbated by the Mandel-Cryer effect induced by the delayed relaxation of the pore pressure from the aggregate center. The model suggests that high-porosity, low-permeability aggregates are the most vulnerable to D-cracking. Concrete with low-porosity, low-permeability mortar matrix, typical of mortar containing supplementary cementitious materials and/or low water to cement ratio, can withstand freezing deformation even with a spacing factor larger than the recommended value. In addition, thermodynamic analysis shows that the disjoining force favors crystal growth, while the dissolved ions suppress the freezing point but are still capable of building high hydraulic pressure in the pore network. We believe that implementation of these models will help practitioners select appropriate combinations and proportions of concrete mixture constituents to build safe, economic, and durable concrete structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to identify High Early-Age Strength (HES) concrete batch designs, and evaluate their suitability for use in the rapid repair of highways and bridge decks. To this end, two criteria needed to be met; a minimum compressive strength of 20. 68 MPa (3000 psi) in no later than 12 hours, and a drying shrinkage of less than 0. 06 % at 28 days after curing. The evaluations included both <b>air-entrained,</b> and non-air-entrained <b>concretes.</b> The cement types chosen for this study included Type III and Type V Portland cement and “Rapid Set” − a Calcium Sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement. In addition, two blended concretes containing different ratios of Type V Portland cement and CSA cement were investigated. The evaluation of the studied concretes included mechanical properties (compressive and flexural strength) and transport properties (absorption, rapid chloride penetration– RCPT, rapid chloride migration– RMT, and water permeability). Additionally, dimensional stability (drying shrinkage) and durability (corrosion of steel, frost resistance, and abrasion resistance) were investigated. Evaluations were conducted based on cement type and common cement factor. Fresh property tests showed that in order to provide a comparable workability, and still remain within manufactures guideline for plasticizer, the water-to-cement ratio was adjusted for each type of cement utilized. This resulted in the need to increase the water-to-cement ratio as the Blaine Fineness of the cement type increased (0. 275 for Type V Portland cement, 0. 35 for Type III Portland cement, and 0. 4 for Rapid Set cement). It was also observed that negligible changes in setting time occurred with increasing cement content, whereas changes in cement type produced notable differences. The addition of air-entrainment had beneficial effect on workability for the lower cement factors. Increasing trends for peak hydration heat were seen with increases in cement factor, cement Blaine Fineness, and accelerator dosage. Evaluation of hardened properties revealed opening times as low as 5 hours for Type V Portland cement with 2. 0 % accelerator per cement weight and further reduction in opening time by an hour when accelerator dosage was increased to 2. 8 % by cement weight. When Type III Portland cement and Rapid Set cement were used, the opening time reduced to as low as 4. 5 hours and 1 hour, respectively. The results for Type V Portland cement concretes showed that as cement factor increased so did mechanical properties until the cement factor exceeded 504 kg/m 3 (850 lb/yd 3), at which point the peak heat of hydration exceeded 46. 1 °C (115 °F) and the mechanical properties decreased. Other evaluations on the studied High Early-Age Strength Type V Portland cement concretes revealed increases in absorption, rapid chloride penetration, water permeability, drying shrinkage, corrosion resistance, and resistance to wear with increases in cement content. On the other hand, rapid chloride migration and frost resistance decreased with increasing cement factor. Increasing the accelerator dosage resulted in an increase in all properties of the HES Type V cement concretes except for frost resistance, which decreased. The addition of air-entrainment had adverse effects on compressive strength, absorption, and rapid chloride migration; while showing lower values for rapid chloride penetration. Curing had positive effects on all hardened properties of the studied HES concretes containing Type V cement. When examining the studied Type III Portland cement concretes, it was seen that an increase in cement content led to decreases in mechanical properties. It is noted that the peak heat of hydration for these concrete exceeded the threshold of 46. 1 °C (115 °F). In addition, increases in cement factor also resulted in decreases in rapid chloride migration, frost resistance and resistance to wear. Increases in cement content resulted in increases in absorption, rapid chloride penetration, water permeability, drying shrinkage, and corrosion resistance. The use of air-entrainment imparted decreases in compressive strength and rapid chloride penetration, increases in absorption, and negligible effects on rapid chloride migration. Extending curing period resulted in beneficial effects on all properties of the studied Type III cement concretes. The studied CSA cement concretes had slightly decreasing strength trends as cement content was increased. Concretes containing CSA cement produced the lowest opening time (one hour) and the highest peak hydration heats of all concretes studied. While its corrosion and frost resistance reduced as cement content increased, the absorption and rapid chloride penetration increased with increasing cement content. For drying shrinkage, opening time curing showed more volume change with increasing cement content, whereas extending curing to 24 hours and 28 days resulted in reduction of drying shrinkage. Increasing cement factor had minimal effects on water permeability and abrasion resistance. Air-entrainments reduced compressive strength, but increased absorption and rapid chloride penetration. Rapid chloride migration was found to be incompatible with CSA cements concretes. All hardened properties of the studied CSA cement concretes improved once curing age was extended to 24 hours and 28 days. When considering the results of the HES blended cement concretes, as Type V cement content increased, 28 -day compressive strength, flexural strength, drying shrinkage (opening time and 24 -hour), corrosion resistance, and resistance to wear increased. Conversely, 24 -hour compressive strength, absorption, rapid chloride penetration, 28 -day rapid chloride migration, water penetration, 28 -day drying shrinkage, and frost resistance reduced with an increase in Type V Portland cement of the High Early-Age Strength blended cement concretes. Reductions in compressive strength and absorption occurred for both studied blended cement concretes when air-entraining admixtures were used. Longer curing provided favorable results for properties of all studied blended cement concretes...|$|R

40|$|Freezing {{of water}} can be {{explained}} by the thermodynamic properties of the water due to the influence of temperature, pressure and special effects such as surface tension and salt solution. Gibbs free energy curves for ice and pore liquid containing different concentrations of NaCl (0 - 6 %) are presented. These curves explain the onset of freezing in pores when the energy level for solid ice and pore liquid containing salt are equal. Upon further cooling a nonequilibrium condition develops since the Gibbs function for pure ice is less than the Gibbs function for the liquid. The theory also explains why ice nucleation is developing in the largest pores containing liquid, including air-voids. Below the nucleation temperature, a vacuum with low partial pressure of the water develops around the ice which starts a cryogenic suction pump. For a closed system (i. e. no external liquid) partial pore-drying develops leading to specimen shrinkage. In <b>air-entrained</b> <b>concrete</b> the ice growth may be accommodated within the pore system without structural damage. In the case external liquid is present, such as when the surface contains a salt solution, pore suction attracts surface liquid, and additional ice growth may not be accommodated within the pore system. Thus, a net expansion occurs. Frost expansion due to crystal growth is time-dependent and progresses as long as liquid is available and until thermodynamic equilibrium is re-established at a given temperature.

Epoxy-coated reinforcement was developed in the early 1970 s as an effective method of corrosion protection. After demonstration projects in the mid 1970 s, the use of epoxy-coated bars in highway bridges expanded rapidly and became the preferred method of corrosion protection. The first evidence of unsatisfactory field performance emerged in 1986 in Florida Bridges in USA, with other examples of corrosion of coated reinforcement reported in USA and Canada in the 1990 s, especially in bridge barriers (among them: Manning 1996; Smith and Virmani 1996). In de-icing environments, the heavy corrosion to the outer side of the vertical bars in the traffic side of the barrier wall was observed in association with section loss in the horizontal bars after 10 – 20  years in service. A recent study conducted by Ontario Ministry of Transportation, MTO, (Lai and Raven 2010) revealed that epoxy coating of the steel bars is compromised after certain number of years in service, leading to corrosion and thus concrete cracks and spalling. Later, MTO banned the use of epoxy-coated bars in bridge barriers while allowing the use of noncorrosive glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars to promote bridge designs that improve the life expectancy and significantly reduce the maintenance cost of bridges.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} determine the environmental durability of the adhesive bond between fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) and concrete. The study specifically focused on freeze-thaw cycling exposure of such bonds and their ultimate strength prior and after the environmental exposure. To investigate the bond strength 84 single lap shear specimens were manufactured utilizing {{two different types of}} carbon FRP pultrued strips and three different structural adhesives for total of three FRP/adhesive combinations. Two types of concrete substrate were used: regular high strength and <b>air-entrained</b> <b>concrete.</b> The specimens were freeze-thaw cycled for three different numbers of cycles using two different freeze-thaw procedures. First freeze-thaw procedure used chloride solution (3 % NaCI) as its medium; the second procedure utilized tap water. This main program was complemented by the same freeze-thaw cycling of pull-off specimens of the adhesively bonded system and dumbbell tension specimens of the three adhesives. Coefficients of thermal expansion of the three structural adhesives were also experimentally measured. Results show that the ultimate strength of the adhesive bond between FRP and concrete deteriorates measurably during freeze-thaw cycling in chloride solution. This must be put into perspective as the concrete itself severely deteriorates during this type of freeze-thaw cycling. Therefore, the durability of the adhesive bond between FRP and concrete is dependent on the durability of the concrete. (cont.) This is also supported by the results of testing of the adhesive tensile specimens that did not show decrease in strength only an increase in ultimate strain. The freeze-thaw cycling in water did not result in any deterioration of the specimens' strength, most specimens actually acquired higher strength, due to moist curing of the concrete during the freeze-thaw cycling. by Pavel Dohnálek.

40|$|Prior to {{handling}} test materials, performing equipment setups, and/or conducting this method, testers {{are required}} to read “SAFETY AND HEALTH ” in Section H of this method. It {{is the responsibility of}} the user of this method to consult and use departmental safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before any testing is performed. A. SCOPE This method has been adapted from a proposal by T. C. Powers. It describes the procedure used to evaluate the resistance to deterioration of aggregates in <b>air-entrained</b> <b>concrete</b> when subjected to a specified period of soaking in water with intervening cycles of freezing and thawing. Values given for maximum size of aggregate, size of test specimen, conditioning prior to soaking, and length of soaking period are intended to be appropriate for construction in localities of severe winter exposure in California. The test conditions are subject to modification if exposure conditions at the site of the work so warrant. When tests are performed for work on a particular project, the test conditions given in this method shall be followed unless otherwise provided in the contract. B. APPARATUS 1. Apparatus specified in ASTM Designation: C 192 for making and curing concrete specimens in the laboratory. 2. One or more refrigerated baths of a size and depth required to contain the test specimens immersed in water-saturated kerosene, and having suitable controls to provide a lowering of the temperature at the rate of 2. 8 ± 0. 6 °C per hour from room temperature to- 17. 8 °C. Household type deep freezing chests with a copper liner have been found to be satisfactory. Two or more baths are desirable unless the number of specimens to be tested at one time is small. 3. One or more water baths of a size and depth required to contain the specimens immersed in water, and equipped with water supply and overflow outlet. 4. A supply of frames, with linear variable differential transformers attached, for supporting test specimens for automatic measurement of length changes during cooling.

40|$|Robust Air is a {{contract}} research project {{carried out at}} Aalto University, Department of Civil Engineering. The project was established due to evelated air content observed in some Finnish concrete structures. The aim of the Robust Air project was to secure {{the stability of the}} protective pore system in normal conditions. The stable protective pore system means that the air content or pore size distribution are not significantly changing after mixing of concrete.  The main part of the research was made in the laboratory tests which were divided into two parts. In the first part the concrete properties were altered and the same admixtures were used. In the admixture tests the concrete properties were kept constant and the admixtures were altered. The main interest of the laboratory tests was to analyze the air content of concrete as function of time. The measurements were carried out immediately after mixing, 30 min and 60 min and finally 75 min after mixing. In addition to the air content, also sensitivity for segregation was analyzed.  In addition to the laboratory tests, factory tests the Finnish concrete industry made tests in which the air content of concrete was measured after normal mixing time but also after 6 min mixing time.   Based on the experiments, it was observed that the mixing process of the <b>air-entrained</b> <b>concrete</b> is not necessarily effective enough. It is possible that only part of the entrained air is formed during the mixing process and there is a risk for elevated air content when the concrete is mixing in the concrete truck. The phenomenon was explained by air content potential. Each concrete has an air content potential (maximum air content) which depends on the admixture combination, concrete composition and the consistency of concrete. A relative effective mixing process is needed to achieve the Air content potential during the mixing process. And if the potential is not reached during the mixing process, there is a risk that the air content may increase later when the concrete is mixed in the truck.   Recommendations were given to minimize the risk for elevated air contents. The recommendations include development actions related to admixtures, concrete mixers, quality control systems and to requirements of frost resistance concrete. The concrete producers need to take the phenomenon better into account in the concrete manufacturing process...|$|E
