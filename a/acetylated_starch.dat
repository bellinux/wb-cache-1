40|$|Efficient {{procedures}} for the preparation of organic-soluble starch nanocrystal (SN) derivatives have been established with different degrees of substitution (DS). The resulting <b>acetylated</b> <b>starch</b> nanocrystals exhibit much improved solubility in common organic solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide, acetone, carbon tetrachloride and toluene. The obtained nanocrystals were characterized {{by means of the}} FT-IR, H- 1 NMR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic techniques. When compared with the hydrophobic performance of the unmodified starch nanocrystals, that of <b>acetylated</b> <b>starch</b> nanocrystals significantly increased according to the contact angle measurement results. X-ray diffraction reveals that the crystalline structure of <b>acetylated</b> <b>starch</b> nanocrystals was changed from style A to style V. The platelet-like starch nanocrystals become sphere-shaped after modification and the size increases compared to the ungrafted particles as revealed by transmission electron microscopic results.

The degree of modification of <b>acetylated</b> and oxidized <b>starches</b> {{is dependent on the}} catalyst and active chlorine concentrations, respectively. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of acetylation and oxidation on the structural, morphological, physical–chemical, thermal and pasting properties of barley starch. Barley <b>starches</b> were <b>acetylated</b> at different catalyst levels (11 %, 17 %, and 23 % of NaOH solution) and oxidized at different sodium hypochlorite concentrations (1. 0 %, 1. 5 %, and 2. 0 % of active chlorine). Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffractograms, thermal, morphological, and pasting properties, swelling power and solubility of starches were evaluated. The degree of substitution (DS) of the <b>acetylated</b> <b>starches</b> increased with the rise in catalyst concentration. The percentage of carbonyl (CO) and carboxyl (COOH) groups in oxidized starches also increased with the rise of active chlorine level. The presence of hydrophobic acetyl groups, carbonyl and carboxyl groups caused a partial disorganization and depolymerization of starch granules. The structural, morphological and functional changes in <b>acetylated</b> and oxidized <b>starches</b> varied according to reaction conditions. Acetylation makes barley starch more hydrophobic by the insertion of acetyl groups. Also the oxidation promotes low retrogradation and viscosity.

40|$|Acetylation {{is one of}} {{the common}} methods of modifying starch {{properties}} by introducing acetil (CH 3 CO) groups to starch molecules at low temperatures. While most acetylation is conducted using starch as anhidroglucose source and acetic anhydride or vinyl acetate as nucleophilic agents, this work employ reactants, namely flour and glacial acetic acid. The purpose of this work are to study the effect of pH reaction and GAA/GF mass ratio on the rate of acetylation reaction and to determine its rate constants. The acetylation of gadung flour with glacial acetic acid in the presence of sodium hydroxide as a homogenous catalyst was studied at ambient temperature with pH ranging from 8 - 10 and different mass ratio of acetic acid : gadung flour (1 : 3; 1 : 4; and 1 : 5). It was found that increasing pH, lead to increase the degree of substitution, while increasing GAA/GF mass ratio caused such decreases in the degree of substitution, due to the hydrolysis of the <b>acetylated</b> <b>starch.</b> The desired starch acetylation reaction is accompanied by undesirable hydrolysis reaction of the <b>acetylated</b> <b>starch</b> after 40 - 50 minutes reaction time. Investigation of kinetics of the reaction observed that the value of mass transfer rate constant (Kcs) is smaller than the surface reaction rate constant (k). Thus, it can be concluded that rate controlling step is mass transfer.   © 2015 BCREC UNDIP.

40|$|The {{requirements}} of good quality and appetizing fast food increases continuously {{as a consequence}} of a community where food is always available. The crispiness of French fries is an issue that must be considered in this context, since it tends to decrease and give the fries a soft surface not appreciated by the consumer. To prolong the crispiness, the fries can be coated by a batter, a mix of starches. The batters used often consists of modified starches, e. g. cross-linked, acetylated and dextrinizated to increase and prolong crispiness, flour to stabilize the batter and sodium bicarbonate to make the batter “rise”. The cross-linked starch keeps the granules in a swelled state and prevents them from breaking when exposed to heat or processing: therefore, it delays the gelatinization and decreases the stickiness of the batter. The <b>acetylated</b> <b>starch</b> delays the retrogradation since it prevents amylose from packing when retrograded. It also stabilizes the batter. The dextrin added consists of heat and acid processed starch and decreases the gelatinization temperature of the batter. It also gives an appetizing color to the French fries. The aim of this project is to give further understanding of the ingredients´ functions, and to find alternative ingredients in a recipe already used, since the price of some ingredients has increased rapidly during the last few years. By studying an existing recipe and by doing a literary research some of the ideas were applied in the laboratory, followed by sensory and technical evaluations where color, appearance, crispiness, hardness and, to some degree, taste were evaluated. The viscosity of the starch solutions was measured since it indicates the pick-up (the amount of batter attached to the French fries). Pick-up and texture were also analyzed. Experiments confirmed the hypothesis that the <b>acetylated</b> <b>starch</b> was unnecessary and could be replaced by cross-linked starch. A high degree of cross-linking seemed to decrease the crispiness, which may depend on the prevented granule swelling. Replacing the cross-linked starch with native potato starch did not work since the batter became way too sticky. The flour could, to some degree, be replaced by native potato starch since the crispiness was very distinct. Too high concentrations of native starch made all batters very sticky, though, probably because of the early granule “explosion” caused by processing and high frying temperatures. Maize flour was an alternative to the flour currently used, since the color, appearance and crispiness of the French fries were very good according to the sensory evaluations. Although the difference between the batters seemed evident when evaluated sensory, statistics made sure that it was not significant. More research and tests {{needs to be done to}} assure the results of this project. It is also necessary to verify that the laboratory results are identical to those in industry. However, the study gave further understanding of the function of the ingredients and confirmed that there are several ways of improving an already good concept. I takt med att allt större krav ställs på snabbmatsrestauranger och - producenter ökar också pressen att hitta livsmedel som lever upp till dessa. Stärkelsecoating av pommes frites används idag i många industrier i syfte att attrahera konsumenten genom en ökad krispighet och ett mer aptitligt utseende. Som namnet Clear-coat batter anger, ska battern inte synas utan används enbart i syfte att ge en förbättrad struktur. Syftet med det här examensarbetet är att hitta billigare ersättningar till de stärkelsevarianter som i dagsläget används i ett fungerande koncept, samt att öka förståelsen för de ingående komponenternas påverkan på slutresultatet. Arbetet tar sin början med en litteratursökning för att sedan fortsätta med appliceringsförsök och påföljande sensorisk och teknisk analys. De sensoriska analyserna, baserade på färg, utseende, krispighet och hårdhet hos pommes frites coatade med batter, stärkelseblandning, låg till grund för vidare försök och avgjorde vilka receptmodifieringar som skulle granskas ytterligare genom viskositets - pick-up - och texturmätningar. Den acetylerade stärkelse som används i referensreceptet hade inte någon tydlig påverkan på slutresultatet, utan kunde ersättas med tvärbunden stärkelse. Det framgick även att det rismjöl som används till viss del kunde ersättas med nativ potatisstärkelse, samt att majsmjöl gav ett mycket tillfredsställande resultat. Testerna visade att den tvärbundna stärkelsen var oumbärlig då klistrigheten blev för hög utan denna ingrediens. Det förelåg ingen signifikant skillnad mellan de olika recepten vid texturmätning, men fler försök behövs för att säkerställa denna slutsats...|$|E
40|$|Starches {{isolated}} from 3 Chinese sweet potato varieties (XuShu 18, SuShu 2, and SuShu 8) differed in granule size and {{particle size distribution}} {{as well as in}} protein, lipid and phosphorus contents but the amylose contents were similar for these starches (19. 3 - 20. 0 %). The pasting behavior, swelling pattern, and syneresis properties were investigated and found to vary. On comparison, the physicochemical properties of the sweet potato starches rather differ from those of potato and mung bean starches. The quality of the starch noodle made from SuShu 8 starch was well comparable to that made from mung bean starch, and better than that made from SuShu 2 and XuShu 18 starches as evaluated by both instrumental and sensory analysis. Correlation between starch noodle quality and gel properties of the original starches was established {{in order to be able}} to predict the suitability of a starch for starch noodle manufacture. It was found that differently sized granule fractions showed a difference in ash, amylose and phosphorus content, as well as in gel firmness and freeze-thaw stability. The small size (< 20 µm) granule fractions were found to be more suitable for starch noodle making and the qualities of both dried and cooked starch noodles made from these fractions were significantly better than those made from their original starches and much better than those made from the large size granule fractions. Sweet potato and potato starches and their derivatives (acetylated and hydroxypropylated) were also evaluated for the ability to manufacture high quality White Salted Noodle (WSN) by replacing the commonly used wheat flour up to 20 %. It was found that only the use of acetylated starches could significantly improve WSN quality resulting in decreasing cooking loss, and increasing softness, stretchability and slipperiness. The cold peak breakdown (CPBD) of the composite flour, as measured in 1. 5 % NaCl solution, showed a significant correlation with the cooking loss, stretch stiffness and stretchability of WSN. Moreover, <b>acetylated</b> <b>starch</b> from potato and sweet potatoes were studied with respect to the degree of substitution (DS) and acetyl group distribution in differently sized granule fractions. The DS of the fractionated starches increased with decreasing starch granule size dimension. The DS of the amylopectin populations of differently sized granule fractions showed the same trends as the original starches, while the DS of the amylose populations were quite constant. It was confirmed that the acetylation only occurred in the outer lamellae of the crystalline region, but took place in all amorphous regions of starch granules. The acetyl group distribution is more heterogeneous in the amylose populations {{isolated from}} small size granule fractions...|$|E
40|$|Acetylated {{potato and}} sweet potato {{starches}} were fractionated according to granule size. From the fractions obtained amylose and amylopectin were isolated and characterized {{with respect to}} degree of substitution (DS) and degradability with -amylase, -amylase and amyloglucosidase. The DS of the amylose populations of differently sized granule fractions was quite constant. In contrast, the DS of the amylopectin populations originating from the differently sized fractions increased with decreasing granule size. The acetylation was confirmed to occur throughout the amorphous regions, and only {{take place in the}} outer lamellae of crystalline regions of starch granules. The amylose populations isolated from small size granule fractions of the <b>acetylated</b> <b>starches</b> tested were less susceptible to all the enzyme digestions than the amylose originating from the large granule fractions, even though the DS was similar. The acetyl populations groups over the amylose molecules are more heterogeneously distributed and located more closely to the non-reducing ends for amylose originating from small size granule fractions when compared to amylose from lager sized granules...|$|R
40|$|Aims : To {{study the}} effects of amylomaize starch and {{modified}} (carboxymethylated and <b>acetylated)</b> amylomaize <b>starches</b> on the composition of colonic bacteria and the production of volatile fatty acids, in mice. Methods and Results : Balb/c mice were fed with experimental diets containing various amount of amylomaize and modified amylomaize starches. Colonic bacterial populations and short-chain fatty acids were monitored. Results showed that the increases in indigenous bifidobacteria were detected in mice fed all starches tested; however, the highest numbers were observed in the group fed with 40 % unmodified amylomaize starch. The starch type influenced the populations of indigenous Lactobacillus, Bacteroides and coliforms. High Lactobacillus numbers were achieved in the colon of mice fed with high concentration of amylomaize <b>starch.</b> <b>Acetylated</b> amylomaize <b>starch</b> significantly reduced the population of coliforms. In addition, orally dosed amylomaize utilizing bifidobacteria reached their highest levels when fed together with amylomaize or carboxymethylated amylomaize starch and in both cases butyrate levels were markedly increased. Conclusions: These results indicate that different amylomaize starches could generate desirable variation in gut microflora and that particular starches may be used to selectively modify gut function. Significance and Impact of Study: Amylomaize starch appeared to enhance the desirable composition of colonic bacteria in mice, and suggested it possessed the potential prebiotic properties. MTherefore, resistant starch and its chemical derivatives may exert beneficial impacts to the human colon...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} hydroxpropyl β-cyclodextrin (HPβ-CD) on {{physical}} properties and digestibility of wheat, potato, waxy maize and high-amylose maize starches {{before and after}} acetylation was studied. Effect of HPβ-CD on amylose-lipid complexes in native and <b>acetylated</b> potato <b>starches</b> synthesized using α-lysophosphatidylcholine was also studied. Acetylation increased swelling factor, amylose leaching, peak viscosity and susceptibility to α-amylase hydrolysis, but decreased gelatinization temperature and enthalpy and gel hardness in all starches. HPβ-CD markedly increased swelling factor and amylose leaching in native and <b>acetylated</b> wheat <b>starches</b> but {{had little or no}} impact on other starches. Wheat starch gelatinization enthalpy decreased in the presence of HPβ-CD but gelatinization temperature of all the starches was slightly increased. HPβ-CD had no influence on enzymatic hydrolysis. Melting enthalpy of amylose-lipid complex in both native and <b>acetylated</b> wheat <b>starches</b> was decreased by HPβ-CD. Acetylation also decreased the melting enthalpy of amylose-lipid complex in wheat starch. Similar trend of thermal transitions was observed in the presence of HPβ-CD for the amylose-lipid complexes synthesized in potato starch. Acetylation reduces the complex formation ability of the amylose polymer. Similar to gelatinization, acetylation widened the melting temperature range of amylose-lipid complexes while shifting it to a lower temperature. Higher swelling and amylose leaching, and decreased gelatinization temperature and enthalpy resulting from acetylation of wheat starch is consistent with its influence on starch hydration. Similar effects resulting from the inclusion of HPβ-CD were consistent with the disruption of amylose-lipid complex by HPβ-CD which promotes granular hydration. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
