5|$|The Court {{held that}} it can judicially review the {{exercise}} of prosecutorial power and declare a prosecution to be unconstitutional for breach of constitutional power, for example, if a prosecution is brought in bad faith for an ulterior motive and not to punish an <b>accused</b> person for an offence he or she committed. A prosecution {{can also be found}} to have infringed the <b>accused</b> person's constitutional rights. This may happen if law enforcement officers themselves commit crimes by using agents provocateur in a particularly egregious manner to entrap <b>accused</b> persons into committing crimes, and the Attorney-General elects to prosecute only the <b>accused</b> persons but not the officers, as this may infringe the <b>accused</b> persons' right to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{in all of}} {{the above}} examples, the Bulveristic fallacy can go the other way.

5|$|The court further {{considered}} whether {{invocation of}} Miranda rights could be implied from the behavior or ambiguous {{words of the}} <b>accused.</b> It concluded (in line with previous cases such as Davis v.

5|$|All eight {{were cleared}} by Phips' proclamations, leading Stoughton to storm from the court.

5|$|Anne's {{downfall}} came {{shortly after}} she had recovered from her final miscarriage. Whether it was primarily the result of allegations of conspiracy, adultery, or witchcraft remains {{a matter of debate}} among historians. Early signs of a fall from grace included the King's new mistress, the 28-year-old Jane Seymour, being moved into new quarters, and Anne's brother, George Boleyn, being refused the Order of the Garter, which was instead given to Nicholas Carew. Between 30 April and 2 May, five men, including Anne's brother, were arrested on charges of treasonable adultery and <b>accused</b> of having sexual relationships with the queen. Anne was also arrested, <b>accused</b> of treasonous adultery and incest. Although the evidence against them was unconvincing, the <b>accused</b> were found guilty and condemned to death. George Boleyn and the other <b>accused</b> men were executed on 17 May 1536. At 8am on 19 May 1536, Anne, age 36, was executed on Tower Green.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{had begun}} his law {{practice}} dealing primarily with commercial issues but won greater prominence in Cincinnati {{as a criminal}} defense attorney, defending several people <b>accused</b> of murder.

Hayes also defended slaves who had escaped and were <b>accused</b> under the recently enacted Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. As Cincinnati was just across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state, it was a destination for escaping slaves and many such cases were tried in its courts. A staunch abolitionist, Hayes found his {{work on behalf of}} fugitive slaves personally gratifying as well as politically useful, as it raised his profile in the newly formed Republican Party.|$|E
