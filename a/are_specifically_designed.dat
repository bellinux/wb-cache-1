5|$|Cross-country {{skiing is}} a form of skiing where skiers rely on their own {{locomotion}} to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using ski lifts or other forms of assistance. Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that <b>are</b> <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> for the sport.|$|E
5|$|Many reticle {{illumination}} {{and pattern}} options are available. Common light sources used in firearm reflector sights include battery powered lights, fiber optic light collectors, and even tritium capsules. Some sights <b>are</b> <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> {{to be visible}} when viewed through night vision devices. The color of a sight reticle is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds. Some sights use a chevron or triangular pattern instead, to aid precision aiming and range estimation, and still others provide selectable patterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{chemical}} process, PUREX (Plutonium–URanium EXtraction) reprocesses {{spent nuclear fuel}} to extract plutonium and uranium {{which can be used}} to form a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for reuse in nuclear reactors. Weapons-grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix. MOX fuel is used in light water reactors and consists of 60kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel; after four years, three-quarters of the plutonium is burned (turned into other elements). Breeder reactors <b>are</b> <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> to create more fissionable material than they consume.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{there has}} been growth in {{industries}} relating to wine storage. Some wine connoisseurs may elect to store their wine at home in a dedicated room, closet or cellarette. Other options involve purchases and rentals at off-site wine storage facilities that <b>are</b> <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> for the task.|$|E
25|$|Size {{and shape}} variances in the boards {{accommodate}} for different snow conditions and riding styles. Shorter boards are typically considered youth size and {{designed for use}} by children, though some varieties of short boards <b>are</b> <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> for a special purpose, such as the performance of snowboarding tricks. Such tricks may {{take place in a}} snowpark alongside freestyle skiers.|$|E
25|$|Some {{dewatering}} objectives include {{reducing the}} volume {{to reduce the}} transport and storage costs, removing liquids before landfill disposal, reducing fuel requirements before further drying or incineration, producing adequate material for composting, avoiding runoff and pooling when used for land applications, and optimizing other drying processes.

25|$|In {{the very}} {{smallest}} kits, in jazz, and {{at very high}} volumes, ride cymbals may be played in with the technique and sound of a crash cymbal. Some hi-hats will also give a useful crash, particularly thinner hats or those with an unusually severe taper. At low volumes, producing a good crash from a cymbal not particularly suited to it is a highly skilled art. Alternatively, specialised crash/ride and ride/crash cymbals <b>are</b> <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> to combine both functions.|$|E
25|$|Some backpacks <b>are</b> <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> {{to carry}} certain items. Common {{examples}} include backpacks for small valuable {{items such as}} laptops and cameras; backpacks designed to hold laptop computers in particular generally have a padded compartment to hold the computer and medium-sized pockets and flaps to accommodate accessories such as charger cables and mice. These are especially common in college and university settings. In order to supply these devices with electricity, a few high-end backpacks are equipped with solar panels.|$|E
25|$|Many {{problems}} in mathematics, physics, and engineering involve integration where an explicit formula for the integral is desired. Extensive tables of integrals have been compiled and published {{over the years}} for this purpose. With the spread of computers, many professionals, educators, and students have turned to computer algebra systems that <b>are</b> <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> to perform difficult or tedious tasks, including integration. Symbolic integration {{has been one of}} the motivations for the development of the first such systems, like Macsyma.|$|E

25|$|Most modern solid-carbide bits {{should not}} be used in {{conjunction}} with a spot drill bit or a center drill bit, as solid-carbide bits <b>are</b> <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> to start their own hole. Usually, spot drilling will cause premature failure of the solid-carbide bit and a certain loss of hole quality. If it is deemed necessary to chamfer a hole with a spot or center drill bit when a solid-carbide drill bit is used, it is best practice to do so after the hole is drilled.|$|E
25|$|Some typefaces <b>are</b> <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> to {{be printed}} at small sizes, {{for example in}} {{telephone}} directories or on newsprint paper. Bell Gothic and Bell Centennial, commissioned for telephone directories, are notable examples of this. Small-print designs often feature a large x-height, and a chunky design. Some fonts used at such sizes may be members of a larger typeface family joining members for normal sizes. For example, the Times New Roman family contains some designs intended for small print use, as do many families with optical sizes such as Minion.|$|E
25|$|Other people {{raise the}} issue of hazards to the animals in their working environments. The risk of {{accidental}} detonation of a mine by an animal is of concern to some; the Navy maintains that the chances of this are minimal, because the animals are trained not to touch the mines, which in any case <b>are</b> <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> not to be detonated by marine animals. Another fear is that opposing forces, aware of mine-hunting dolphins in a given area, may shoot dolphins in the water, leading to deaths of both NMMP and native animals.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, the IB Primary Years Program (PYP) was {{launched}} as an initiative to prepare both Junior School and Preparatory School {{students for the}} IB Diploma Program. The School is currently {{in the second phase}} of accreditation as a PYP school. Despite its relative success, however, the IB Middle Years Program (MYP) has not been introduced into the Middle School. Both the PYP and the MYP <b>are</b> <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> for an introduction into the IB, and, due to the popularity of the IB among students, there is a chance that the MYP will be brought into the Middle School in years to come, although the School has neither confirmed nor denied this.|$|E
25|$|Athletic shoes <b>are</b> <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> {{to be worn}} for {{participating}} in various sports. Since friction between the foot and the ground is an important force in most sports, modern athletic shoes are designed to maximize this force, and materials, such as rubber, are used. Although, for some activities such as dancing or bowling, sliding is desirable, so shoes designed for these activities often have lower coefficients of friction. The earliest athletic shoes {{date back to the}} mid 19th century were track spikes— leather shoes with metal cleats on the soles to provide increased friction during running. They were developed by J.W. Foster & Sons, which later become known as Reebok. By the end of the 19th century, Spalding also manufactured these shoes as well. Adidas started selling shoes with track spikes in them for running and soccer in 1925. Spikes were eventually added to shoes for baseball and American football in the 20th century. Golfers also use shoes with small metal spikes on their soles to prevent slipping during their swing.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} {{table lists}} the mixes and their constituent songs {{that are available}} on the DJ Hero 2 disc. Most mixes involve two different songs, but others are beat juggles using the same core song on two different tracks for unique effects. Within the game's career mode, songs are arranged in six venues, and further into three or four song setlists, often featuring songs all mixed by the same DJ artist. In certain sets that feature a real-life artist, the player will perform as that artist's avatar within the game. The player must earn a certain number of stars from previous venues and setlists to unlock later ones. Other mixes <b>are</b> <b>specifically</b> <b>designed</b> as Battle Mixes to be played in the game's two-player DJ Battles mode. [...] All mixes are available to play in the game's Quickplay mode.|$|E
