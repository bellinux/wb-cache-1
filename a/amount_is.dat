40|$|Summary. In this {{preliminary}} investigation milk samples from 4 multiparous amiata asses and 5 half-breed mares {{belonging to the}} same farm located near Grosseto (Tuscany), feeding the same pasture, were collected and analyzed. Milk samples collection was performed {{in the first three}} mounths of lactation. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) analysis were performed to quantify 3 -sialyllactose (3 -SL) and 6 -sialyllactose (6 -SL). 3 -SL and 6 -SL highest <b>amounts</b> <b>were</b> found in mares samples (197. 3 mg/L e 82. 2 mg/L), while highest asses <b>amounts</b> <b>were</b> 45. 1 mg/L and 49. 8 mg/L respectively. 3 -SL <b>amounts</b> <b>were</b> higher in all mares samples than in donkey samples; in mares samples 3 -SL <b>amounts</b> <b>were</b> always higher than 6 -SL...|$|R

5|$|Currently {{geothermal}} power heats 89% of {{the houses}} in Iceland and over 54% of the primary energy used in Iceland comes from geothermal sources. Geothermal power is used for many things in Iceland. 57.4% of the energy is used for space heat, 25% is used for electricity, and the remaining <b>amount</b> <b>is</b> used in many miscellaneous areas: swimming pools, fish farms, and greenhouses, for example.|$|E
5|$|Mercury is used {{primarily}} for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications. It is used in some thermometers, especially ones which are used to measure high temperatures. A still increasing <b>amount</b> <b>is</b> used as gaseous mercury in fluorescent lamps, {{while most of the}} other applications are slowly phased out due to health and safety regulations and is in some applications replaced with less toxic but considerably more expensive Galinstan alloy.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{available}} einsteinium toxicity data originate from research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% einsteinium ends in the blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50 years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20 years, although this is rendered irrelevant by the short half-lives of einsteinium isotopes), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries – where einsteinium stays indefinitely. About 10% of the ingested <b>amount</b> <b>is</b> excreted. The distribution of einsteinium over the bone surfaces is uniform and {{is similar to that}} of plutonium.|$|E

5|$|Poultry {{meat and}} eggs provide nutritionally {{beneficial}} food containing protein of high quality. This {{is accompanied by}} low levels of fat which have a favourable mix of fatty acids. Chicken meat contains about {{two to three times}} as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured by weight. However, for boneless, skinless chicken breast, the <b>amount</b> <b>is</b> much lower. A 100-g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 g of fat and 31 g of protein, compared to 10 g of fat and 27 g of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.|$|E
5|$|Similarly to {{the other}} rare-earth metals, {{lutetium}} has no known biological role, but it is found even in humans, concentrating in bones, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the liver and kidneys. Lutetium salts are known to occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature; the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides. Human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content, so it is not known how much the average human takes in, but estimations show the <b>amount</b> <b>is</b> only about several micrograms per year, all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants. Soluble lutetium salts are mildly toxic, but insoluble ones are not.|$|E
5|$|The College {{is almost}} entirely self-financed, {{and is not a}} {{recipient}} of any regular public funding. Its officers do have official salaries, which {{are paid for by the}} Crown. The salaries of the officers were raised during the reign of King James I, but were reduced under William IV. These salaries per annum reflected the living costs of the day; however today the <b>amount</b> <b>is</b> seen only as nominal payment. In addition to their official duties, the heralds have for many centuries undertaken private practice in heraldry and genealogy, for which professional fees are charged.|$|E

5|$|The {{permanganate}} {{exhibits a}} higher toxicity than the manganese(II) compounds. The fatal dose is about 10g, and several fatal intoxications have occurred. The strong oxidative effect leads to necrosis of the mucous membrane. For example, the esophagus is affected if the permanganate is swallowed. Only a limited <b>amount</b> <b>is</b> {{absorbed by the}} intestines, but this small amount shows severe effects on the kidneys and on the liver.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{structure}} of the SYNOP code, a maximum of three cloud symbols can be plotted for each reporting station that appears on the weather map. All cloud types are coded and transmitted by trained observers then plotted on maps as low, middle, or high-étage using special symbols for each major cloud type. Any cloud type with significant vertical extent that can occupy more than one étage is coded as low (cumulus and cumulonimbus) or middle (nimbostratus) depending on the altitude level or étage where it normally initially forms aside from any vertical growth that takes place. The symbol used on the map for each of these étages at a particular observation time is for the genus, species, variety, mutation, or cloud motion that is considered most important according to criteria set out by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). If these elements for any étage at the time of observation are deemed to be of equal importance, then the type which is predominant in <b>amount</b> <b>is</b> coded by the observer and plotted on the weather map using the appropriate symbol. Special weather maps in aviation show areas of icing and turbulence.|$|E

5|$|In October 2011, Heineken {{sold the}} McEwan's beer brands to Wells & Young's for around £20 million, and {{production}} of McEwan's Best Scotch and canned and bottled brands moved to Bedford. The new owners vowed to reintroduce McEwan's as a cask ale brand and launch an expanded premium bottled range. Together with the Younger's brands McEwan's generates £80 million of sales annually in the UK, and McEwan's is now the largest Wells & Young's brand. It is the highest-selling ale brand in Scotland where it has a 20 per cent market share. Like most largely pasteurised ale brands in the UK {{it has been in}} a state of managed decline. The beers are sold predominantly in Scotland and the north of England; a small <b>amount</b> <b>is</b> exported to Italy. 2012 saw the launch of McEwan's Export in bottles, and a new seasonal cask-conditioned golden ale called McEwan's Gold. In 2013, export sales to Canada were resumed, having been discontinued under Heineken. In April 2013 McEwan's Red was launched, aimed at younger drinkers and with the intention of expanding the brand into England. McEwan's beers began to be sold in France in April 2013. The bottled beers McEwan's Amber and Signature were launched in July 2013.|$|E
5|$|In the {{citric acid}} cycle, all the {{intermediates}} (e.g. citrate, iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate and oxaloacetate) are regenerated during each {{turn of the}} cycle. Adding more {{of any of these}} intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that the additional <b>amount</b> <b>is</b> retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence, the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, {{during the course of the}} cycle, increase or decrease the amount of oxaloacetate available to combine with acetyl-CoA to form citric acid. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of ATP production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.|$|E
5|$|Like all Tylopilus species, T.felleus is mycorrhizal. It {{is found}} in {{deciduous}} and coniferous woodland, often under beech and oak in well-drained acid soils, which can be sandy, gravelly or peaty. If encountered on calcareous (chalky) soil, {{it will be in}} moist areas that have become waterlogged and have ample leaf litter. Fruit bodies grow singly or in small groups, and occasionally in small clusters with two or three joined {{at the base of the}} stem. Fruit bodies have also been growing in the cavities of old trees, on old conifer stumps, or on buried rotten wood. The fungus obtains most of its nitrogen requirements from amino acids derived from the breakdown of proteins, although a lesser <b>amount</b> <b>is</b> obtained from the amino sugar glucosamine (a breakdown product of chitin, a major component of fungal cell walls). The mycorrhizal plant partner benefits from the fungus's ability to use these forms of nitrogen, which are often abundant in the forest floor. Fruit bodies appear over summer and autumn, anytime from June to October or even November, in many of the northern temperate zones. Large numbers may appear in some years, and none in others, generally proportional to the amount of rainfall. Variety uliginosus, known from Michigan, grows among lichens and mosses under pines.|$|E
