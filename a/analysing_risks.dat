Investing in real estate development projects, which are characterised by complexity and uncertainty, implies that high risks are taken. Interestingly, little is known about how real estate development organisations have incorporated the skills and procedures necessary to deal successfully with the risky nature of the business. This thesis offers insight into the investment decision making process of three prominent Dutch real estate development companies. The result is an explanatory framework that demonstrates that making good investment decisions is not restricted to <b>analysing</b> <b>risks</b> to support the justification of decisions, but it is also necessary to address decision problems in time, and to ensure that someone is accountable for the decision. The framework offers an innovative perspective on risk management and decision making. Additionally, the thesis presents management practices used to ensure that risks are taken knowingly. These practices are of relevance to senior management of real estate development organisations to design and improve its own decision making procedures. Architectur...|$|E

40|$|Formal risk {{analysis}} techniques applied in managing construction project risks {{tend to focus}} on risks that lend themselves to 'objective' methods of economic analysis. Although subjective probabilities and Bayesian methods are applied successfully in other industries to manage 'subjective' risks similar to those encountered in construction contracts, very little is reported on the application of such methods for <b>analysing</b> <b>risks</b> in construction contracts. An investigation has been carried out into using subjective expert opinions and Bayesian methods in construction contract {{risk analysis}}. The elicitation of expert opinions about the risk of encountering adverse ground conditions on construction sites is examined. Prior distributions of expert opinions about the risk form the critical component in the Bayesian analysis of risk. The conclusion of this is that although construction professionals have difficulty estimating intermediate and tail values of probability distributions, elicitation techniques can be used to develop prior distributions of contract risks which, coupled with sample information on the risks, would enable the Bayesian analysis of risks. Effective strategies for systematically analysing significant individual contract risks often covered under an 'arbitrary' project contingency sum can now be developed to enhance the risk management efforts of contractors and construction experts.

40|$|Fifteen multi-national mining {{companies}} are currently {{members of the}} Earth Moving Equipment Safety Round Table (EMESRT). Formed in 2006, EMESRT engages with mining equipment manufacturers {{with the aim of}} accelerating improvements in the safe design of mining equipment. An initial stage in this process was to communicate industry understanding of the risks in the form of “design philosophies” that describe potential unwanted events in eight hazard categories. A technique for <b>analysing</b> <b>risks</b> associated with operation and maintenance tasks, the Operability and Maintainability Analysis Technique (OMAT), was subsequently developed and trialed. The next step is the EMESRT Design Evaluation for Equipment Procurement (EDEEP) process. The aims of requesting manufacturers to follow this process are to provide equipment purchasers with a common way of assessing how well the issues in the EMESRT Design Philosophies are addressed in the equipment design; and to provide manufacturers with additional information for use during equipment design. The process involves identifying priority tasks based on frequency and severity of the consequences of potential unwanted events identified in the EMESRT Design Philosophies; undertaking a task-based risk assessment of priority tasks in conjunction with site-based personnel; evaluating the effectiveness of control measures; and providing information about safe design features in a standardised format...|$|E
40|$|Accidents are {{now widely}} {{acknowledged}} to be a systems phenomenon. As {{part of a}} proactive approach to safety management, organisations use risk assessment methods to identify the hazards and associated risks {{that may lead to}} accidents. Although there is an extensive body of literature on the need for a systems thinking approach in accident analysis, little has been said regarding the theoretical underpinnings of risk assessment methods. The aim of this paper was to systematically review the risk assessment methods presented in the literature and evaluate {{the extent to which they}} are underpinned by a systems thinking approach. A total of 342 methods spanning a range of safety-critical domains were evaluated using Rasmussen’s tenets of accident causation. A key finding is that the majority of existing risk assessment methods are not consistent with Rasmussen’s model of accident causation (arguably the most popular model in safety science circles). Instead, the majority of risk assessment methods focus on risks at the so called sharp-end and largely view accidents as emerging from a linear, or chain-of-events process. This overlooks emergent risks at other levels of the system, including supervisory, managerial, regulatory and government levels. The findings therefore suggest that the majority of existing risk assessment methods may be inadequate for identifying hazards and <b>analysing</b> <b>risks</b> within complex sociotechnical systems. The implications for risk assessment practice are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundOrganisations spend a {{considerable}} amount of time and effort on diagnosing and <b>analysing</b> <b>risks</b> within their organisation. In the area of occupational and process safety, a myriad of employee survey instruments is available. Many studies show that operational processes {{play an important role in}} an organisations overall safety. Yet, so far safety surveys mainly focus on safety measures or operational safety processes. A flexible instrument was developed with which a wide variety of constructs, from different disciplines, can be measured in a consistent and practical way. The resulting survey distinguishes itself from existing safety surveys by extending the scope with the operational processes which are also referred to as the ‘Core Business’. StudyThis study reports on the development of a catalogue of constructs which were derived from scientific literature and practice. Each of these constructs has been developed with a view towards measurability in an employee survey. The reliability and validity for fifteen of these constructs was assessed. Five separate projects have been conducted within a range of organisations operating as high risk industries. ResultsConstruct validity and the dimensional structure of the instrument have been established through exploratory factor analysis and confirmed through confirmatory factor analysis. Diverse aspects derived from motivational and ergonomic approaches to safety proved to be distinguishable in this analysis. ConclusionThe described instrument allows the mapping and quantification of various aspects of the operational process that are, based on existing knowledge, related to the occurrence of incidents...|$|E

40|$|Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG’s) now control {{two-thirds of}} the NHS budget for England, {{influencing}} healthcare provider priorities and playing {{a key role in}} implementing the NHS plan. However significant failures in healthcare has highlighted a dissonance between expressed values of leaders and everyday routine practices. This research aims to explore the leadership behaviour of Commissioners and the role it plays in determining Quality & Safety (Q&S) in healthcare. The research took a pragmatic mixed method approach using two phases: phase 1 used focused video ethnography to observe Commissioners (n= 9) verbal and non-verbal communication in an open forum setting. The research method further develops the process to observe real time group dynamics and may aid decision making processes for leaders in healthcare. Phase 2 employed a quantitative questionnaire (n= 48) to determine the leadership behaviours that subordinates would expect their Commissioners to adopt. The findings of this research identified that the leadership style most prevalent within the Commissioners was transactional in nature. The Commissioners felt joint ownership of the risks to patients from providers of healthcare services, with empathy and understanding of the pressure their colleagues were under. The most prevalent behaviour within the group determined outcomes of risk analysis. The questionnaire to subordinates of Commissioners identified that transformational leadership had the best outcome on staff performance if this was linked to positive leadership style. In addition Commissioners appeared to lack consistency when <b>analysing</b> <b>risks</b> effectively and therefore holding providers to account, citing issues such as “professional drift” and concerns over further scrutiny, as validation for this approach. This confusion of leadership behaviours, allied with poor analysis of risk leaves Commissioners prone to repeating previous healthcare failures...|$|E
40|$|Diverse and {{considerable}} energies {{are associated with}} mobile equipment operated and maintained on mine sites. Loss of control of these energies is a common cause of injury on mine sites and this is wellrecognised by the mining industry. In 2006, 4 multi-national mining companies formed the Earth Moving Equipment Safety Round Table (EMERST), {{with the aim of}} engaging collectively with the manufacturers of equipment to accelerate improvements in mining equipment design. Originally focused on surface mining equipment, and particularly haul trucks, the focus of EMESRT widened to include underground and exploration equipment. Since 2006, EMESRT has maintained a program of regular visits and other engagements with a steadily increasing number of manufacturers. The membership of EMESRT has also increased, with 15 companies being members in 2012. An initial step undertaken by the EMESRT members was the development of “Design Philosophies” which drew of the collective experience of mining companies to identify potential unwanted events which cause equipment related injuries and illness. A technique for <b>analysing</b> <b>risks</b> associated with operation and maintenance tasks, the Operability and Maintainability Analysis Technique (OMAT), was subsequently developed and trialled. In 2011, the EMERST members resolved to propose a common form of safe design information to be requested by all members companies during procurement, and the resulting EMERST Design Evaluation for Equipment Procurement (EDEEP) process was launched at MINExpo in Las Vegas in September 2012. The outcomes of OMAT risk assessment and control activities are integrated during this process into a common “Safe Design Information” template for communication to prospective purchasers. The aims of requesting manufacturers to follow this process are to provide equipment purchasers with a common way of assessing how well the issues in the EMESRT Design Philosophies are addressed in the equipment design; and to provide manufacturers with additional information for use during equipment design.

40|$|To {{deal with}} risks and {{uncertainties}} in life cycle costing explicitly and objectively, this thesis proposes a probabilistic model using simulation and applies {{the model to}} apartment buildings constructed by the KNHC in Korea. The proposed model was developed in a deductive way based on apartment management practice. The model incorporates capital costs, operation and minor maintenance costs, utility costs, major maintenance costs, and removal costs. Required data were collected by a survey using structured interview schedules. Each cost group was analysed, statistically modelled, and combined in the suggested simulation model. The model extends current models by introducing the concepts of replacement cycles and maintenance ratios {{in the form of}} probability distributions to predict major maintenance costs. It uses a regression model and its prediction intervals to estimate operation and minor maintenance costs. It is also possible to explore dynamically the risk implications by varying key parameters. The study also pioneered a data screening technique based on current building conditions to account for different levels of past and current maintenance. Through the application, it is demonstrated that the model can significantly improve the realism of life cycle costing, and that the model is highly suitable for <b>analysing</b> <b>risks</b> in life cycle costing. It can be used not only for risk analysis involved in life cycle costing of buildings but also for selecting design alternatives, decision making related to project feasibility, required sinking funds estimation, and maintenance planning. The expected life cycle cost for the KNHC's apartments is I, 787, 827 Won/m 2 {{with a standard deviation of}} 73, 268 Wonlm 2 in 1992 constant terms over 50 years. The proportion of each cost group to the life cycle cost is: major maintenance costs (31. 8 %), utility costs (27. 4 %), capital costs (25. 4 %), operation and minor maintenance costs (13. 5 %), and removal costs (1. 9 %). Avoidable costs resulting from early replacements add up to 116, 149 Wonlm 2 (25. 6 % of the capital costs) in 1992 discounted terms. This cost can be significantly reduced by the extended use of structurally sound existing buildings, if more resources are allocated to maintenance...|$|E
