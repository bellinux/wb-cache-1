5|$|Grasshoppers may be {{confused}} with Ensifera (crickets, etc.), but they differ in many aspects; these include the number of segments in their antennae {{and the structure of}} the ovipositor, as well as the location of the tympanal organ <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> by which sound is produced. Ensiferans have antennae that can be much longer than the body and have at least 20–24 segments, while caeliferans have fewer segments in their shorter, stouter antennae.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time that he was {{becoming}} increasingly vocal and visible in politics, Havelock's scholarly work was moving toward the concerns that would occupy him for the bulk of his career. The first questions he raised about the relationship between literacy and orality in Greece concerned the nature of the historical Socrates, which was a long-debated issue. Havelock's position, drawn from analyses of Xenophon and Aristophanes as well as Plato himself, was that Plato's presentation of his teacher was largely a fiction, and intended to be a transparent one, whose purpose was to represent indirectly Plato's own ideas. He argued vociferously against the idea associated with John Burnet, which still had currency at the time, that the basic model for the theory of forms originated with Socrates. Havelock's argument drew on evidence for a historical change in Greek philosophy; Plato, he argued, was fundamentally writing about the ideas of his present, not of the past. Most earlier work in the field had assumed that, since Plato uses Socrates as his mouthpiece, his own philosophical concerns must have been similar to those debated in the Athens of his youth, when Socrates was his teacher. Havelock's contention that Socrates and Plato belonged to different philosophical eras was the first instance of one that would become central to his work: that a basic shift in the kinds of ideas being discussed by intellectuals, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> of discussing them, happened at some point between the end of the fifth century BC and the middle of the fourth.|$|E

25|$|Alan Turing, who {{had written}} a {{memorandum}} to OP-20-G (probably in 1941), was seconded to the British Joint Staff Mission in Washington in December 1942, because of his exceptionally wide knowledge about the bombes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> of their use.

The initial order was scaled down to 96 machines.|$|E

The Georama had been smaller and of a simpler construction though, using material and paper draped over an iron frame, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> employed there would not have been applicable to Wyld's larger, more robust version.|$|E
25|$|Leukoedema is common. It {{occurs in}} about 70-90% of black skinned adults and about 50% of black skinned children. The {{prevalence}} in white skinned people is considerably less, but reports range {{from less than}} 10% to more than 90%, probably varying depending upon the population studied, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> used in the study, e.g. examination conditions and the diagnostic criteria. The ethnic variation {{may be explained by}} genetic factors or simply because black skinned people have greater amount of melanin in the mucosa, making it appear darker (termed racial or physiologic pigmentation). This darker mucosa may make the edematous changes more noticeable, whereas in the mucosa of people with lighter skin types leukoedema gives a milder presentation.|$|E

25|$|Jaspers' {{dissatisfaction with}} the popular {{understanding}} of mental illness led him to question both the diagnostic criteria <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> of clinical psychiatry. He published a paper in 1910 in which he addressed the problem of whether paranoia was an aspect of personality or the result of biological changes. Although it did not broach new ideas, this article introduced a rather unusual method of study, {{at least according to}} the norms then prevalent. Not unlike Freud, Jaspers studied patients in detail, giving biographical information about the patients as well as notes on how the patients themselves felt about their symptoms. This has become known as the biographical method and now forms a mainstay of psychiatric and above all psychotherapeutic practice.|$|E
25|$|Burnett {{returned}} to London in 1894; there she heard news that her younger son Vivian was ill, so she quickly {{went back to}} the United States. Vivian recovered from his illness, but missed his first term at Harvard University. Burnett stayed with him until he was well, then {{returned to}} London. At this time she began to worry about her finances: she was paying for Vivian's education; keeping a house in Washington D.C. (Swan had moved out of the house to his own apartment); and keeping a home in London. As she had in the past, she turned to writing as a source of income and began to write A Lady of Quality. A Lady of Quality, published in 1896, was to become {{the first of a series}} of successful adult historical novels, which was followed in 1899 with In Connection with the De Willoughby Claim; and in 1901 she had published The Making of a Marchioness <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Methods</b> of Lady Walderhurst.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} poly{{histidine}} tags are formed of six histidine (6xHis tag) residues - which are added at the N-terminus preceded by Methionine or C-terminus before a stop codon, in the coding {{sequence of the}} protein of interest. The choice of the end where His-tag is added will depend mainly {{on the characteristics of}} the protein <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> chosen to remove the tag. Some ends are buried inside the protein core and others are important for the protein function or structure. In those cases the choice is limited to the other end. On the other hand, most available exopeptidases can only remove the His-tag from the N-terminus; removing the tag from the C-terminus will require the use of other techniques. It is important to take into account that the computer simulation (by molecular dynamic) will help you to choose between options, for example, whether the His-tag must be digested or engineered to the N- or C-terminal.|$|E
