40|$|This study {{investigates the}} climate-based {{performance}} of a lightshelf system {{in the context of}} multi-story office buildings, which is {{regarded as one of the}} most important strategies for achieving the comfortable daylit environment in areas with a highly luminous climate. Computer simulations by DAYSIM are performed to predict <b>annual</b> light <b>quantities</b> <b>in</b> the daylit zones. The DAYSIM results are also compared to several simplified experimental methods, in which the systems are tested under diffuse skies only. These methods use either Daylight Factor (DF) or Coefficient of Utilization (CU) as the performance indicator. The findings show that certain simplified experimental methods, especially the ones based on CU, can be reasonably accurate for climate-based assessments of sidelighting systems in a daylight climate similar to Raleigh, North Carolina...|$|R

40|$|A ferry {{transportation}} system consists of many factors, which interact {{in a complex}} manner. Such a system {{is very difficult to}} analyze analytically. A computer simulation is thus an appropriate method to aid in understanding the system and its design. The Province of Maluku, which consists of thousands of islands spread haphazardly, has suffered from having an ineffective sea {{transportation system}}. A good sea transportation system is essential for the development of this island province. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze a ferry transportation system suitable for the Province of Maluku. As an initial step, the study proposes to model ferry traffic between a major port Ambon and nine outlying smaller communities on surrounding islands. The performance of the ship to be measured is the time spent during its annual operation, that is, travelling/voyage time at sea, waiting time at the offing, and service time at a dock in a port. The other performance of the ships to be measured is the annual number of trip needed by a particular ship to carry the <b>annual</b> <b>quantity</b> of commodity. <b>In</b> doing so, a computer model written in MODSIM III is used to support decision-making. Since the actual commodity data were inaccessible, a very general model was developed which can be utilized under any conditions, making the model very flexible to changing. The model will be run under some configurations, which includes the use of five different types of ship and its <b>quantity</b> <b>in</b> a particular route. A trial and error procedure will be carried out in order to obtain several optimum performances of ships in the whole system...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{study the}} {{potential}} impact of environmental exposure to petrol lead, residential area, age, sex, and lead exposing hobby, on blood lead concentrations (BPb) in children. METHODS [...] In the south of Sweden, yearly from 1978 - 94, BPb was measured in 1230 boys and 1211 girls, aged between 3 and 19 (median 10; quartiles 9 and 12) years. RESULTS [...] For the samples of 1978, the geometric mean (GM) was 67 (range 30 - 250) micrograms/l in boys and 53 (18 - 161) micrograms/l in girls, whereas the corresponding GMs for 1994 were 27 (12 - 122) and 23 (12 - 97) micrograms/l. The sex difference was present only in children over eight. Moreover, residential area affected BPb; in particular, children living near a smelter area had raised BPbs. There was a clear ecological relation between BPb (adjusted GM) and <b>annual</b> lead <b>quantity</b> <b>in</b> petrol sold in Sweden, which was estimated to be 1637 tonnes in 1976 and 133 tonnes in 1993 (P < 0. 001, ecological linear regression analysis, where a two year lag of petrol lead was applied). In the 171 boys and 165 girls who were sampled twice with an interval of one to four years, the decreases in BPb were estimated to be 6 % (95 % confidence interval 4 %- 8 %) and 10 % (8 %- 13 %) /year, respectively. CONCLUSIONS [...] The present report points out the considerable beneficial effect of the gradual banning of petrol lead on the lead exposure affecting the population and differential sex specific BPb patterns due to a pronounced age effect in girls, which may be caused by older girls' lower food intake per kg of body weight, lower lung ventilation, cleaner life style, and loss of blood lead through menstrual bleedings...|$|R

40|$|Adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) are sum {{parameter}} can {{be determined}} in surface waters, drinking water and waste water {{as well as in}} soil and leachate from landfills. Although the presence of AOX in waters is of anthropogenic origin, they may also be of natural origin. In water environments they have long half-life, they resist breaking down and can accumulate in the food chain. Some of the compounds that are ranked among the AOX, are carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic at high concentrations. Threshold values of AOX's in drinking water are not detemined by Slovenian legislation. First measurements of AOX concentrations in drinking water were made in 2014, in areas where water supply system is managed by Hydrovod d. o. o., Komunala Brežice d. o. o., Komunala Črnomelj d. o. o., Komunala Metlika d. o. o., Komunala Novo mesto d. o. o. in Kostak d. d. The Master thesis gives an overview of the concentrations of AOX in surface, groundwater, potable water and in industrial wastewater in the Dolenjska and Bela Krajina regions between 2000 and 2014. Based on the data obtained, {{it was found that the}} concentrations of AOX in drinking water in the area of Ribnica, Kočevje and Sodražica water supply systems (karst surface of mesozoic limestone and dolomite), were higher than at other measuring sites. Moreover, concentrations of AOX in drinking waters treated with chlorine compounds were higher than in raw water. Concentrations of AOX in surface waters were mostly suitable and status of surface water bodies was identified as good. It was also found that in most plants the <b>annual</b> <b>quantity</b> of AOX <b>in</b> technological wastewaters exceeds the threshold for waste waters. ...|$|R
