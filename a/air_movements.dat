5|$|In 1998, No.84 Wing was reorganised as {{a special}} {{transport}} wing, headquartered at Richmond. The Caribous were transferred to No.86 Wing and No.84 Wing took over responsibility for No.33 Squadron, operating Boeing 707 tanker-transports, and No.34 Squadron, operating VIP transports, in addition to controlling No.32 Squadron. By mid-2006, No.32 Squadron had converted to Beech King Air 350s and transferred to Air Force Training Group, while No.84 Wing had assumed control of No.285 Squadron and <b>Air</b> <b>Movements</b> Training and Development Unit (AMTDU). AMTDU was subsequently moved under the direct aegis of ALG, and No.33 Squadron under No.86 Wing, following the retirement of the 707s. No.37 Squadron, by then the RAAF's sole Hercules unit, was transferred from No.86 Wing to No.84 Wing in 2010. No.35 Squadron, which had been merged with No.38 Squadron in 2000, was re-formed under No.84 Wing in 2013 to operate Alenia C-27J Spartan tactical transport commencing in 2015; the squadron was detached from the wing in January 2014 but is scheduled to return as the Spartan becomes operational.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the {{delivery}} of Australia's first C-17s, RAAF personnel received training on the aircraft in the United States. From May 2006 a group of pilots and loadmasters led by Wing Commander Linda Corbould, the commanding officer designate of No. 36 Squadron, undertook conversion training with the USAF's C-17 units at Altus Air Force Base and Charleston Air Force Base. A group of 48 technical personnel also received training at Charleston and McChord Air Force Base from September that year. No. 36 Squadron began a period of intensive training once Corbould delivered A41-206 to Amberley on 7 December 2006, and the unit achieved initial operating capability status in September 2007. Also in 2007, the RAAF's No. 1 Air Operations Support Squadron was expanded by 80 personnel to provide air load teams to support the Globemasters. A project to acquire the equipment needed to allow the RAAF's C-17s {{to be used in}} the aeromedical evacuation role and develop associated crew procedures began in late 2007. The first Globemaster aeromedical evacuation sortie was flown on 5 September 2008, the day after the type was certified to operate in this role. On 8 December 2008, Corbould led the RAAF's first all-female aircrew during a training flight over South East Queensland to mark the second anniversary of the entry of the Globemaster into service. A team of USAF trainers was posted to Amberley until the RAAF had sufficient C-17 pilots who were qualified to instruct others. The RAAF began training new C-17 pilots in early 2010 after the flight simulator was delivered, and the first Australian-trained pilots graduated in early May that year. No. 36 Squadron achieved final operating capability status in December 2011. The components for a simulated C-17 cargo compartment were delivered to Amberley in early 2013, and this facility was commissioned in November that year. The simulator is used to train <b>air</b> <b>movements</b> and medical staff as well as to develop and trial new cargo carrying techniques for the C-17s. The first Australian-trained Globemaster loadmasters graduated in mid-2014. The final element of C-17 aircrew training to be routinely conducted in the United States was the course to qualify co-pilots as aircraft captains. This course was relocated to Australia in mid-2017.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the impact of <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> through {{building}} constructions. The method of solution was as follows: First, selection of a common building construction type. A 2 D construction related with common exercise 1 was selected.

The used internal and external boundary conditions (i. e. temperature, humidity and wind induced pressures) were based on a typical Dutch climate. Third, evaluation of the results. The paper presents the details of the mentioned method and a discussion of the results.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the {{modeling and simulation}} of 2 D heat and moisture transport with and without <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> for a building construction. The research focuses {{on the effect of}} <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> through building constructions. Although the typical <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> inside building constructions is quite small (velocity is of order ~ 10 - 5 m/s), this research shows it might have much more impact on the moisture characteristic as presumed so far. Our results indicate that especially vapor transport is in our case study very sensitive for <b>air</b> <b>movement.</b> As much as 40 % Rh change at the inner surfaces of the building constructions are observed if we take <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> into account. Concerning the simulations tool, it is concluded that the use of the COMSOL Multiphysics software enables and simplifies the research of possible important effects that are not included in other standard heat and moisture simulation tools...|$|R

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>movement</b> {{is one of}} the six main {{variables}} determirzing human thermal comfort; air temperature, relative humidity, mean radiant temperature, metabolic rate, {{and clothing}} insulation are the others. Recently, HVACde sign in;zovations, energy conservation concerns, and new laboratory data on fan cooling and drafts have brought substantial ~tttention to the issue of acceptable levels of <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> in qO’ice environments. Thermal comjort standards for indoor occupancy include <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> limits that are constructed from often conflicting evidence and are frequently difficult to apply. A primary reason is that, while <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> can provide desirable cooling in "warm" conditions, it can also increase the risk of unacceptably cool drafts. The transition zone from desirable cooling to uncomfortable draft is a complicated function of physics, physiology, and human expectation. This work focuses on <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> for cooling in the expected temperature range, 25. 5 °C to 28 [...] 5 °C, of this transition zone. Fifty-four human subjects were given control of the air supply velocity from a desk fan (FAN), a floor-mounted diffuser (FMD). and a desk-mounted diffuser (DMD) single ambient air temperature. The subjects were asked to adjust the <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> as they pleased to make themselves comfortable. These tests encompassed the full temperature range of the "transition zone," 25. 5 °C to 28. 5 °C.

40|$|In the ASHRAE comfort {{database}} [1], underpinning the North American naturally ventilated adaptive comfort standard [2], {{the mean}} indoor air velocity associated with 90 % thermal acceptability was relatively low, rarely exceeding 0. 3 m/s. Post hoc studies of this database {{showed that the}} main complaint related to <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> was a preference for more <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> [3, 4]. These observations suggest the potential to shift thermal acceptability to even higher operative temperature values, if higher air speeds are available. If that were the case, would it be reasonable to expect temperature and <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> acceptability levels at 90 %? This paper focuses on this question and combines thermal and <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> acceptability percentages {{in order to assess}} occupants. Two field experiments took place in naturally ventilated buildings located on Brazil's North-East. The fundamental feature of this research design is the proximity of the indoor climate observations with corresponding comfort questionnaire responses from the occupants. Almost 90 % thermal acceptability was found within the predictions of the ASHRAE adaptive comfort standard and yet occupants required 'more air velocity'. Minimum air velocity values were found in order to achieve 90 % of thermal and <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> acceptability. From 24 to 27 degrees C the minimum air velocity for thermal and <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> acceptability is 0. 4 m/s: from 27 to 29 degrees C is 0. 41 - 0. 8 m/s, and from 29 to 31 degrees C is > 0. 81 m/s. These results highlight the necessity of combining thermal and <b>air</b> <b>movement</b> acceptability in order to assess occupants' perception of their indoor thermal environment in hot humid climates. 7 page(s...|$|R

25|$|Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond {{was formed}} in April 1952 to replace the former Station Headquarters, along with a {{subordinate}} unit, Base Squadron Richmond, for the day-to-day running of the establishment. The base was evacuated in February 1956 due {{to the threat of}} rising floodwaters nearby, the only time in its history that flooding in the Hawkesbury region became serious enough to warrant such action. In 1958–59, No.36 Squadron began operating its first C-130 Hercules heavy transports, which were augmented by No.38 Squadron's DHC-4 Caribou tactical transports in 1964. No.86 Wing was disbanded in August that year, but reformed in February 1987, under the newly established Headquarters Air Lift Group that replaced the former Base Headquarters. At the same time, Base Squadron was reformed as Base Support Wing. No.86 Wing took control of No.33 Squadron, operating Boeing 707 jet tanker/transports, as well as Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons, flying Hercules. No.486 Maintenance Squadron and <b>Air</b> <b>Movements</b> Training and Development Unit (AMTDU) were also under its aegis at Richmond. The Hercules, Caribous and 707s became synonymous with disaster relief and emergency transport in Australia and the region, as well as deploying on overseas peacekeeping missions. Richmond was the venue for many air shows including, in 1988, the largest staged in Australia to that date, celebrating the Australian Bicentenary. The base also staged the RAAF's 70th Anniversary Air show in 1991, the same year that the Hercules achieved 500,000 accident-free hours of operation.|$|E
