40|$|The {{deposition}} {{patterns of}} large-particle microbiological aerosols within the respiratory tract {{are not well}} characterized. A novel system (the flow-focusing aerosol generator [FFAG]) which enables the generation of large (> 10 -μm) aerosol particles containing microorganisms under laboratory conditions was characterized to permit determination of deposition profiles within the murine respiratory tract. Unlike other systems for <b>generating</b> large <b>aerosol</b> particles, the FFAG is compatible with microbiological containment and the inhalational challenge of animals. By use of entrapped Escherichia coli cells, Bacillus atrophaeus spores, or FluoSphere beads, the properties of <b>aerosols</b> <b>generated</b> by the FFAG were compared with the properties of <b>aerosols</b> <b>generated</b> using the commonly available Collison nebulizer, which preferentially generates small (1 - to 3 -μm) aerosol particles. More entrapped particulates (15. 9 - to 19. 2 -fold) were incorporated into 9 - to 17 -μm particles generated by the FFAG than by the Collison nebulizer. The 1 - to 3 -μm particles generated by the Collison nebulizer {{were more likely to}} contain a particulate than those generated by the FFAG. E. coli cells aerosolized using the FFAG survived better than those aerosolized using the Collison nebulizer. <b>Aerosols</b> <b>generated</b> by the Collison nebulizer and the FFAG preferentially deposited in the lungs and nasal passages of the murine respiratory tract, respectively. However, significant deposition of material also occurred in the gastrointestinal tract after inhalation of both the small (89. 7 %) - and large (61. 5 %) -particle <b>aerosols.</b> The <b>aerosols</b> <b>generated</b> by the Collison nebulizer and the FFAG differ with respect to mass distribution, distribution of the entrapped particulates, bacterial survival, and deposition within the murine respiratory tract...|$|R

For this purpose, an isolated power system {{is used as a}} case study. The contribution of a pumped-storage hydropower plant to reduce the system scheduling costs is assessed in the paper by using a hydrothermal weekly unit commitment model. The model considers different start-up costs and ramps of the thermal <b>generating</b> <b>units</b> {{as a function of the}} start-up type.
