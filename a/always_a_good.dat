5|$|The {{necessary}} use of heuristics {{for multiple}} alignment means that for an arbitrary set of proteins, there is <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> chance that an alignment will contain errors. For example, {{an evaluation of}} several leading alignment programs using the BAliBase benchmark found that at least 24% of all pairs of aligned amino acids were incorrectly aligned. These errors can arise because of unique insertions into one or more regions of sequences, or through some more complex evolutionary process leading to proteins that do not align easily by sequence alone. As the number of sequence and their divergence increases many more errors will be made {{simply because of the}} heuristic nature of MSA algorithms. Multiple sequence alignment viewers enable alignments to be visually reviewed, often by inspecting the quality of alignment for annotated functional sites on two or more sequences. Many also enable the alignment to be edited to correct these (usually minor) errors, in order to obtain an optimal 'curated' alignment suitable for use in phylogenetic analysis or comparative modeling.|$|E
5|$|Starting in {{a neutral}} position, Karma can reach up to Hero on the Good side or Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as {{stopping}} to help injured citizens or killing them to restore Cole's health, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma moments, the Karma moments are delivered with 3D cutscenes and character-driven dialogue, the action pauses and the player has two actions that can be taken, <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> and Evil option. There are also Good and Evil side missions in the game as well as random events which provide Karma decisions. Completion of Karma awarding missions helps gain access to unique powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Karma also influences the way that citizens view Cole in addition to altering Cole's appearance and {{certain aspects of the}} game's story. Citizens may throw rocks at and turn on Cole if he has Evil Karma or take pictures of and compliment Cole if he has Good Karma.|$|E
25|$|Lesions rarely are {{localized}} and {{can affect}} {{large areas of}} the brain. Processing in the brain is generally not localized and requires many areas of the brain to process. Furthermore, lesioning may interfere with pathways that span the lesion site. Thus, lesions are not <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> way to determine what specific brain areas do. Therefore, a degree of skepticism should be kept in mind when viewing lateralization data from lesion studies.|$|E

[...] With this dish, cooks can use up small portions of various ingredients that were not sufficient for an individual meal.

500|$|As a {{young man}} Fauré had been very cheerful; a friend wrote of his [...] "youthful, even {{somewhat}} child-like, mirth." [...] From his thirties he suffered bouts of depression, which he described as [...] "spleen", possibly first caused by his broken engagement and his lack of success as a composer. In 1890 a prestigious and remunerative commission to write an opera with lyrics by Paul Verlaine was aborted by the poet's drunken inability to deliver a libretto. Fauré was plunged into so deep a depression that his friends were seriously concerned about his health. Winnaretta de Scey-Montbéliard, <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> friend to Fauré, invited him to Venice, where she had a palazzo on the Grand Canal. He recovered his spirits and began to compose again, writing {{the first of his}} five Mélodies de Venise, to words by Verlaine, whose poetry he continued to admire despite the operatic debacle.|$|E
500|$|The album {{remains a}} {{favorite}} among audiophiles. According to Paul Tingen, from Sound on Sound magazine, The Nightfly was [...] "for years a popular demonstration record in hi-fi stores across the globe." [...] Paul White, editor-in-chief of Sound on Sound, said The Nightfly [...] "is <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> reference for checking out monitoring systems and shows what good {{results could be}} obtained from those early digital recording systems in the right hands." [...] In addition to its use in recording studio tests, Clive Young of Pro Sound News called Fagen's [...] "I.G.Y." [...] the [...] "Free Bird" [...] of pro audio, claiming that almost every live sound engineer uses the song to test the front-of-house system's sound response. EQ Magazine rated The Nightfly as among the Top 10 Best Recorded Albums of All Time, alongside the Beatles's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds.|$|E

[...] His point was echoed by Rudy Klapper from Sputnikmusic, who described the song as a [...] "regret-filled apology". Stephen M. Deusner from Engine 145 gave the song a thumbs-up and praised Swift as [...] "an expressive singer", calling the song [...] "a dark fantasy of apology and reconciliation" [...] which is [...] "a true heartbreaker". Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe graded {{the production of the}} song as [...] "B", complimenting the lyrics in particular, by writing [...] "it’s <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> sign when there’s a line as memorable as that one, the kind that lingers around in your head more than the song itself."

500|$|In June 2010, Marvel Television was {{launched}} with Jeph Loeb as head. By July 2012, the division had entered into discussions with ABC {{to create a}} show set in the MCU, and in August, ABC ordered a pilot for a show called S.H.I.E.L.D., with The Avengers writer/director Joss Whedon involved; it was later renamed Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. In January 2014, the series Marvel's Agent Carter was announced, joining Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. at ABC, while a put pilot order for the half-hour live-action comedy series, Marvel's Damage Control, was revealed in October 2015. While talking about Marvel potentially making comedy series, Loeb said in January 2016 that Marvel always feels humor should {{be a part of}} anything they produce, despite possibly fitting more within a darker genre, as Daredevil and Jessica Jones do, while also staying [...] "grounded and real".

When Bobby married her, he wasn’t marrying milk toast; she was very, very spirited; she was <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> person. I always felt Pam was the moral centre of the programme but she was complicated, and she was fiery, she had opinions, and she was not afraid to voice them. But as the years went by, as JR became more and more evil, the writers felt, and I certainly understand why {{for the benefit of the}} show, that Pam had to become more and more good." [...] When asked about whether she had any input on her characters growth, she said: [...] "Once the show achieved extraordinary world wide fame, I don’t think any of us had much input. [...] You know the old saying, if it's not broken, don’t fix it; I really believe that Lorimar Television looked upon it as something that was working and they did not want to deviate from the formula." ...|$|E

500|$|Due {{to being}} vivified electricity, Cole {{is unable to}} use vehicles, take up weapons, or swim. Cole easily climbs {{buildings}} and other structures and can fall a great height without taking damage. Many powers are acquired {{over the course of}} the game; once acquired the player can use experience points, awarded for specific actions, stunts and missions, to increase the power's effectiveness. The growth of these powers is affected by Cole's current Karma level. Starting in a neutral position, it ranges from Guardian to Champion to Hero on the Good side, [...] and from Thug to Outlaw to Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as stopping to help injured citizens or draining their health to restore Cole's, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma Moments, when the action pauses and the player is told, through a monologue by Cole, of two actions that can be taken, <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> and bad option. For example, one scenario the player is presented with is to either pull a valve and get a spray of tar in his face (Good), or force a civilian to do it for him (Evil). There are also a number of paired Good/Evil side missions in the game; completing one will lock out the other mission but will reward the player with a large amount of Karma towards their selected Karma goal. Completion of these missions helps gain access to unique super powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Doing so will lock out any purchased power(s) in the original chosen Karma sector. In addition to altering Cole's appearance and certain aspects of the game's story, Karma also influences the behavior of the citizens of Empire City, they will come to help Cole in battle if his Karma is Good, but will turn on Cole and throw rocks at him if he has Bad Karma.|$|E

2500|$|The Senator explosion, as {{with the}} Gazelle 21 years before, was blamed on her engineer's having allowed low water in her boilers, so that when her engines were shut off, steam {{pressure}} built up too quickly, causing boiler failure. [...] Low water in the boiler was a situation where flames and hot gases from the firebox were allowed to have {{direct contact with the}} metal boiler tubes and other critical components when there should have been a barrier of water preventing this. [...] The result would be either weakening of the metal over time or too quick a buildup in steam pressure, either one causing failure of the boiler jacket, that is, an explosion. [...] Hunter, in his thorough survey on the subject, cautions however that low boiler water, while often a cause of an explosion, was not <b>always</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> enough explanation, and that it had been shown by experiments as early as 1836 that a well-filled boiler could still explode, and that overheating caused by low water in the boiler frequently but not always led to an explosion.|$|E

In 1894/95 he played for New South Wales against South Australia but made only 11 and 0 runs in his two innings.
