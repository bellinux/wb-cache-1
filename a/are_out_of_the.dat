The Doctor and Amy work with Van Gogh to defeat the Krafayis, but in their attempt to have Van Gogh realise his legacy through bringing him to the future they ultimately realise that not all of time can be rewritten and there are some evils which <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Doctor's reach.|$|E
5|$|Mumbai {{consists}} of two distinct regions: Mumbai City district and Mumbai Suburban district, which form two separate revenue districts of Maharashtra. The city district region is also {{commonly referred to as}} the Island City or South Mumbai. The total area of Mumbai is 603.4km2 (233 sq mi). Of this, the island city spans 67.79km2 (26 sq mi), while the suburban district spans 370km2 (143 sq mi), together accounting for 437.71km2 (169 sq mi) under the administration of Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). The remaining areas belong to various Defence establishments, the Mumbai Port Trust, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Borivali National Park, which <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jurisdiction of the MCGM. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region which includes portions of Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts in addition to Greater Mumbai, covers an area of 4,355km2 (1681.5 sq mi).|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament adds new modes: Leagues, Time Trials, Single Race, and Tournaments. In League mode, players {{compete for}} points in divisions. Seasons consist of four races. Players {{with the most}} points {{at the end of}} the season are {{promoted}} to the next division, and players with the least are relegated. Time Trial mode is where players race alone (although some tracks have a Shadow Racer representing the best time) for the best time, or to practise driving. Single Race is where players compete in a series of rounds in which vehicles begin at the centre of the scree, and get further apart as the race progresses. If a vehicle goes off the screen, they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race unless they have travelled the furthest. The game ends when only one player remains. Tournaments are a fixed race series played in the same manner as Single Races. The winner is the first player to win a set number of times. There are two multiplayer-only modes: Knockout and Share Games. Knockout involves a series of races similar to tournament mode, with winners progressing to the next round and losers knocked out. Share Games is similar to Single Race, but cars are coloured according to team, with each team's finishing position depending on which member performs the best. The Mega Drive J-Cart provides two controller ports, enabling up to eight players in multiplayer by two players sharing the controllers. The Game Gear version retains the console sharing (two player sharing one console) function of the original, and two units can be linked.|$|E

25|$|South African {{pharmaceutical}} manufacturer Cipla Medpro experienced {{difficulty in}} maintaining forecast accuracy {{as the company}} grew.

25|$|Some {{pistol shrimp}} species share burrows with goby fishes in a {{symbiotic}} relationship. The burrow is built and tended by the pistol shrimp, and the goby provides protection by {{watching out for}} danger. When both <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burrow, the shrimp maintains contact with the goby using its antennae. The goby, having the better vision, alerts the shrimp of danger using a characteristic tail movement, and then both retreat into {{the safety of the}} shared burrow. So far this association has been observed in species that inhabit coral reef habitats.|$|E

25|$|Ecclesiastically {{divorced}} Orthodox (not civilly divorced only) {{are usually}} allowed to remarry in the Orthodox Church, {{though there is}} usually imposed on them a fairly severe penance by their bishop and the services for a second marriage in this case are more penitential than joyful. Widows are permitted to remarry without repercussion and their second marriage is considered just as valid as the first. One exception to this rule is the clergy and their wives. Should a married priest die, it is normal that his wife will retire to a monastery once their children <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. Widowed priests {{are not allowed to}} remarry (no priest may be married after his ordination) and also frequently end up in monasteries.|$|E
25|$|Porous bass trap {{absorbers}} {{need to be}} {{very thick}} to be effective at lower frequencies so they tend to be allocated either as diagonal wedges in the corners or as thick rectangular bulk behind false walls where they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way and less likely to disrupt higher frequencies or room function. Air gap behind a porous panel absorber e.g. straddling a corner also helps to ensure it protrudes more into the room where there is more air velocity, improving its velocity-based absorption and extending its bandwidth while inducing some ripple in its absorption spectrum. Resonant bass trap absorbers need to be at a pressure maximum and tend to be thinner, so they are more conveniently and effectively positioned flat against a wall in a corner where the pressure is maximum, rather than straddling a corner where there is more velocity.|$|E
25|$|Odie is a yellow, long-eared beagle with a large, slobbering tongue, {{who walks}} {{on all four}} legs, though {{occasionally}} he will walk on two like Garfield. He was originally owned by Jon's friend Lyman, though Jon adopted him after Lyman was written out of the strip. The book Garfield: His 9 Lives (1984) retcons Odie's origin: {{there is no mention}} of Lyman, and Odie was a puppy when he was acquired by Jon as company for Garfield (when Garfield was a kitten). Odie is usually portrayed as naïve, happy, affectionate and blissfully unaware of Garfield's cynical, sadistic nature, despite the physical abuse Garfield exhibits toward him, including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself. On some occasions, however, he is depicted more intelligently, as one strip, in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent Garfield from doing this, and actually hurts Garfield's foot. In one strip when Garfield and Jon <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, Odie is seen reading War and Peace and watching a television program, An Evening With Mozart. Odie has only talked once. In another strip, published on January 28, 2010, he is seen solving Jon's sudoku puzzle.|$|E

The summer season sees generally east and southeast winds across the peninsula. During the summer months, the average wind pattern implies a surface ridge axis which normally lies across central Florida, with easterly winds from Tampa southward and southwest winds across northern Florida. The peak wind gust during the 1930 through 1997 period was 115mph (100knots) at Miami International Airport during Hurricane Andrew.|$|E

[...] Because of his bat speed and the wide range of pitch locations of which he could hit, Taveras successfully unraveled what are termed as [...] "pitcher's pitches", which helped contribute to his high batting average.

500|$|The game {{is broken}} up into three episodes: [...] "Marooned on Mars", [...] "The Earth Explodes", and [...] "Keen Must Die!".

One night while his parents <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, he flies to Mars to explore, but while away from the ship the Vorticons steal four vital components and hide them in Martian cities. Keen journeys through Martian cities and outposts to find the components, {{despite the efforts of}} Martians and robots to stop him. [...] After securing the final component, which is guarded by a Vorticon, Keen returns to Earth—discovering a Vorticon mothership in orbit—and beats his parents home, who discover that he now has a pet Yorp.|$|E
500|$|Aided by Gilmer's findings, Stan Love filed unsuccessfully for conservatorship on May 17, 1990. A {{press conference}} with Stan at the lectern {{featured}} an unexpected appearance from Brian.

The ruling was finalized on February 3, 1992 when Landy was barred by court order from contacting Brian, leaving his affairs to the hands of conservator Jerome S. Billet. In December 1992, Landy was fined $1,000 for violating the court order when he visited Brian in June for his birthday.|$|E
