Multiple process lay-outs can be rapidly assembled and chemical process results obtained on a scale ranging from several grams per experiment up to approximately 100 kg at a moderate number of experiments per day (3-15). A secondary transfer of engineering findings {{in the context of a}} plant engineering exercise (scale-out) then provides target capacity of typically single product dedicated plants. This mimics the success of engineering contractors for the petro-chemical process industry.Dedicated developments. Manufacturer of microstructured components are mostly commercial development partners to scientists in search of novel synthesis technologies. Such development partners typically excel in the set-up of comprehensive investigation and supply schemes, to model a desired contacting pattern or spatial arrangement of matter. To do so they predominantly offer information from proprietary integrated modeling systems that combine computational fluid dynamics with thermokinetic modelling. Moreover, as a rule, such development partners establish the overall <b>application</b> <b>analytics</b> to the point where the critical initial hypothesis can be validated and further confined.|$|E
40|$|Business {{analytics}} {{refers to}} the skills, technologies, applications and practisies for continuous iterative exploration and investigation of past business performance to gain insight and drive business planning. Business analytics focuses on developing new insights and understanding of business performance based on data and statistical methods. Business intelligence traditionally focuses on using a consistent set of metrics to both measure past performance and guide business planning, which is also based on data and statistical methods. Analytics makes extensive use of data, statistical or quantitative analyses, explanatory and predictive modeling, and fact based management to drive decision, making. Analytics {{may be used as}} input for human decisions or may drive fully automated decisions. In other words, querying, reporting, OLAP, and alert tools can answer questions such as what happened, how many, how often, where the problem is, and what actions are needed. Business analytics can answer questions like why is this happening, what if these trends continue, what will happen next, what is the best that can happen (optimize). Example of <b>application</b> <b>analytics</b> in different areas: banks use data analyses to differentiate among customers based on credit risk, usage of other characteristics with appropriate product offering. Harrah's company (from 2010 renamed and called Caesers entertaiment. Gaming corporation that owns and operate over 50 casinos, hotels, and seven golf courses under several brands), uses analytics for customer loyalty programs. Deere & Company (manufacturer of agricultural machinery like tractors, combine harvesters, sprayers and other) saved more than $ 1 billion by employing and implementing a new analytical tool to better optimize inventory. We can mention areas where within analytics are basic domain model: sales/retail business, financial services, risk & credit, marketing, fraud, pricing, telecommunications, supply chain, transportation and many others...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} explore how the massive {{application}} of animal welfare on the sheep sector in Sardinia has been implemented {{both from the}} point of view of the effectiveness and efficiency of the interventions of the EU measure which has made it possible to evaluate the results, both through an analysis of the perception consumers have of the concept of animal welfare on the sheep sector. Wide space has been given to the deepening of the concept of animal welfare is as ethical concept, whether scientific, both as a Community definition. After having extensively analyzed the Community legislation governing the implementation of animal welfare in Europe, have been taken into account the data of the experience gathered in Sardinia by the sheep sector in recent 10 years. Therefore, the present research aims to: (1) highlight the features of this complex and significant policy, which has undergone a few changes over the years; (2) examine the multiple and profound reasons to the source of that policy; (3) see if any ambitious objectives were achieved at the end of the second implementation period in 2015 and (4) identify whether and how the implementation of measures on animal welfare has been instrumental in pushing the livestock industry toward a more modern and rational; (5) try to outline future perspectives from the results achieved. Nevertheless, the current market trends will be examined again to categorize new perspectives in a bi-dimensional reality opportunities and weaknesses to overcome. To describe some prospects in the sixth chapter were analyzed the opinions of stakeholders, to examine in depth the critical remarks on the necessity of the measure and on the advisability of commercial exploitation, and consumers, to analyze in the context of product demand any propensity to purchase products resulting from the respect of animal welfare. Research has shown on an economic basis that the existence of a measure that guarantees public good "welfare of sheep" is still fully justified. <b>Application</b> <b>analytics</b> measure demonstrates the high value and the results achieved through this valuable policy designed and implemented by the region of Sardinia. The future financial situation is the first tough step ahead. The amount and manner of access to financial resources by farmers could drastically change, consider new emergencies facing Europe and the profound change in the global scenario. Whatever the future scenario, the opportunity must be grasped today.
