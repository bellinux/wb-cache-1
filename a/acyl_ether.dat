We studied the vertical distribution of microbial communities and organic matter (OM) cycling in these contrasting porewater regimes down to 5 m depth at an intertidal flat {{of the southern}} North Sea. Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya were targeted, combining intact polar lipid (IPL) analysis with qualitative and quantitative molecular biological techniques. The largely sandy section 1 of the core (50 cm) and the diffusion-dominated section 2 (75 – 490 cm). This suggests bacteria adapting their membranes in response to increasing physicochemical stress and starvation in the nutrient limited, fine grained sediments of section 2 with less bioavailable, predominantly terrestrial, OM. Relative amounts of bacterial <b>acyl</b> <b>ether</b> and diether phospholipids increased in this lower section and were assigned to sulfate reducers and yet uncultured myxobacteria. Archaea were {{an order of magnitude}} less abundant than Bacteria, and were affiliated mainly with Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales. Accordingly, the archaeal IPL composition was typical for a methanogenic community. IPLs not exclusively derived from in situ microbial production emphasize that these biomarkers have to be interpreted with caution in sediments with complex hydrogeology. Our results demonstrate that contrasting subsurface flow regimes significantly impact on the vertical zonation of biogeochemical properties and microorganisms in marine sediments...|$|E

40|$|Autotaxin (ATX) catalyzes the {{hydrolysis}} of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to {{form the}} bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA stimulates cell proliferation, cell survival, and cell migration and is involved in obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, neuropathic pain, atherosclerosis and various cancers, suggesting that ATX inhibitors have broad therapeutic potential. Product feedback inhibition of ATX by LPA has stimulated structure activity studies focused on LPA analogs. However, LPA displays mixed mode inhibition, indicating it can bind to both the enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex. This suggests that LPA may not interact solely with the catalytic site. In this report we have prepared LPC analogs to help map out substrate structure activity relationships. The structural variances include length and unsaturation of the fatty tail, choline and polar linker presence, <b>acyl</b> versus <b>ether</b> linkage of the hydrocarbon chain, and methylene and nitrogen replacement of the choline oxygen. All LPC analogs were assayed in competition with the synthetic substrate, FS- 3, to show the preference ATX has for each alteration. Choline presence and methylene replacement of the choline oxygen were detrimental to ATX recognition. These findings provide insights into {{the structure of the}} enzyme {{in the vicinity of the}} catalytic site as well as suggesting that ATX produces rate enhancement, at least in part, by substrate destabilization. 1...|$|R

Potential problems with treatment regimens involving multiple drugs are side effects, development of drug resistance, noncompliance, and expense (8), and thus, newer approaches to the treatment of H. pylori infection may be of value.

40|$|AbstractLysoglycerophosphocholine lipids (lyso-GPC) are {{important}} intermediates in the synthesis and metabolism of glycerophosphocholine lipids which are major {{components of the}} cellular lipid bilayer. Significant differences in the collisional induced decomposition (CID) behavior were observed {{for each of the}} four different subtypes of lyso-GPC in both positive and negative ions. A major difference was observed in the initial CID product ions derived from lyso-GPC [M + H]+ with the loss of water that was very abundant for acyl lyso-GPC which have a fatty acid ester substituent at either the sn- 1 or sn- 2 positions. Loss of neutral water was not very prominent in the case of plasmenyl and plasmanyl lyso-GPC species. The mechanism responsible for this difference in behavior of lyso-GPC subtypes was consistent with a higher proton affinity of carboxyl carbonyl oxygen atoms and vinyl ether oxygen atoms found in acyl and plasmenyl lyso-GPC lipids, respectively, as compared to the carbinol oxygen atom common to all lyso-GPC species. Collisional activation of lyso-GPC negative ions [M − 15]− also revealed distinctive differences in product ions derived from <b>acyl</b> and <b>ether</b> lyso-GPC species. The acyl compounds showed the facile elimination of a highly stable carboxylate anion, whereas plasmenyl species underwent fragmentation with loss of a neutral aldehyde, likely a result of rearrangement involving the double bond in the vinyl ether moiety. The alkyl ether species (plasmanyl lyso-GPC lipids) did not undergo either decomposition reaction observed for the other lyso-GPC subtypes which permitted differentiation of acyl, plasmenyl, and plasmanyl lyso-GPC subtypes...|$|R
50|$|Sulfur tetrafluoride {{can be used}} {{to replace}} a variety of {{functional}} groups with partially or fully fluorinated derivatives. Liquid hydrogen fluoride {{can be used as a}} solvent and catalyst with SF4 to selectively fluorinate alcohols. SF4's reactivity with carbonyl compounds is not enhanced in the presence of HF. Generally, only relatively acidic alcohols can be fluorinated efficiently with SF4, although amino alcohols appear to be an exception to this rule.(5)When vicinal diols are combined with SF4, difluorination occurs with inversion of configuration at one of the alcohols. This was demonstrated in the synthesis of meso-difluorosuccinate from (L)-tartrate and the synthesis of (D)- and (L)-difluorosuccinate from meso-tartrate.(6)Carbonyl compounds generally react with SF4 to yield geminal difluorides. Reaction times tend to be on the order of hours and yields are moderate.(7)Fluorination of lactones can provide heterocyclic fluorides, although ring opening has been observed for γ-butyrolactone. The six-membered lactide does not experience ring opening.(8)Fluorination opens epoxides to give either geminal or vicinal difluorides in most cases. Monoarylepoxides give geminal products with migration of the aryl group. Yields are low for sterically hindered di- and trisubstituted epoxides. Epoxides substituted with an ester group give vicinal difluorides via an alkoxysulfur trifluoride intermediate.(9)When amines are treated with SF4 and a base, iminosulfur difluorides result. Further reaction of these compounds with alkali metal fluorides leads to nitrile sulfides, which undergo 3+2 cycloaddition in the presence of dipolarophiles.(10)Carboxylic acids react with SF4 to afford trifluoromethyl compounds through the intermediacy of an <b>acyl</b> fluoride. Tetrafluoroalkyl <b>ethers</b> also form via reaction between difluoromethyl cation and acyl fluoride.(11)Sulfur tetrafluoride {{can be used to}} fluorinate polymers efficiently. This often has a profound effect on polymer properties—fluorination of polyvinyl alcohol, for instance, improves its resistance to strong acids and bases.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Autotaxin (ATX) is {{a member}} of the {{nucleotide}} pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family of ectoenzymes (NPP/ENPP). ATX is mostly present in blood, but it is also expressed at high levels in the brain, kidney, lymphoid organs, ovary, lung, and intestine. ATX has lysophospholipase D activity that catalyzes the hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and choline. LPA is a bioactive lipid mediator that facilitates many physiological and pathological processes including cell survival, proliferation, and migration. ATX/LPA signalling has been associated with in a number of human diseases including obesity, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain, Alzheimer’s disease, and cancer. Elevated ATX expression is found in various tumours and has been associated with tumour growth. Because most LPA is produced by ATX activity, an inhibitor of ATX would block subsequent LPA signalling, which is a target for anticancer drug development. Therefore, ATX has become an attractive drug target for developing new anticancer therapies. Our objective for this project is to prepare and assess a series of novel cyclic phenol phosphate analogues for their ability to function as irreversible ATX inhibitors in vitro. In order to investigate the ability of the cyclic phenol phosphate analogues to inhibit ATX, the following aims were outlined: (i) the development of synthetic methodologies for the preparation of a series of cyclic phenol phosphate analogues as potential inhibitors of ATX; (ii) an assessment of the aqueous stability of these analogues over 6 h in 50 mM TRIS buffer at 37 °C and pH 8. 0 using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for analysis; (iii) the determination of the ability of these compounds to inactivate ATX in vitro. In order to investigate the ability of the cyclic phenol phosphate analogues to inhibit ATX, we proposed and designed strategies to synthesize a series of <b>acyl</b> and alkyl <b>ether</b> derivatives of cyclic phenol phosphate analogues. Our initial strategy to synthesize acyl derivatives utilized the dealkylation of 1 (4 -methoxy- 1, 3 -bezenedimethanol); however, this approach was unsuccessful despite attempts to optimize reaction conditions and introduction of alcohol protecting groups. These unsuccessful reactions were likely the result of multiple competing reactions. A second strategy to synthesize alkyl ether derivatives analogues was developed, and we successfully synthesized two model analogues; A 1 (unsubstituted cyclic phenol phosphate) and A 2 (methoxy-substituted cyclic phenol phosphate). We accomplished this through a multi-step synthetic procedure using the salicylaldehyde and its derivatives as our starting materials. We also synthesized an alcohol starting material with a saturated fourteen-carbon ether linkage by modified literature procedures, but incorporation of the cyclic phosphate moiety was unsuccessful. We also evaluated the stability of the synthesized analogues under specific conditions. Analogues A 1 and A 2 were incubated in 50 mM TRIS buffer at 37 °C and pH 8. 0 over six hours and determined to be stable under these conditions, suggesting any ATX inhibitory activity would be the result of the parent compound rather than any decomposition products. Finally, these compounds have been submitted to our colleagues at the University of Memphis for assessment of their in vitro ATX inhibitory ability; however, they have not been able to carry out the ATX inhibition assay yet. Also, we carried out the preliminary in silico docking studies. Our proposed and synthesized analogues of both <b>acyl</b> and alkyl <b>ether</b> derivatives of cyclic phosphate analogues were docked to the active site of the ATX (PDB ID: 3 NKM) to assess their binding affinity. The results of the docking experiment revealed no major differences. However, both A 1 and A 2 show the highest values (i. e. lowest affinity), which indicate that the long side chains of the other ligands play a role in binding to ATX. Thus, the proposed cyclic phenol phosphates have not been previously prepared and can therefore represent a new orientation for the study of ATX inhibitor compounds and may lead to the development of new treatments for ATX-related human diseases in the future, including cancer...|$|R
