500|$|Brian Lowry for Variety, however, {{criticized the}} episode. He wrote that Lynch's {{performance}} was [...] "fitfully funny but usually just plain annoying", calling the pregnancy subplot [...] "credulity-straining". Lowry praised Colfer and Michele, however {{stated that the}} show's talent was squandered by its [...] "jokey, cartoonish, wildly uneven tone". He deemed the show a [...] "one-hit wonder", writing that: [...] "the musical numbersgenerally less infectious and buoyant than the first time outcan’t compensate for overly broad characterizations and absurdly soapy situations." [...] Robert Bianco for USA Today gave a mixed review, commenting: [...] "It {{would be better if}} Glee had more control and fewer abrupt tonal shifts, but that's not the Glee we're getting — <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> wouldn't be Glee at all. It's not perfect, but in a sea of procedural conformity, Glee is its own weird, often enchanting little island escape." [...] While Hank Stuever for The Washington Post praised the show's inclusion of adult storylines alongside teenage drama, Robert Lloyd for the Los Angeles Times felt that the adult characters [...] "tend more to caricature than character", writing of Sue that: [...] "the writing flattens her toward a single note. She's funny from line to line, but there is little to her besides tin-pot contrariness." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan commented similarly: [...] "there's one big flaw in Glee [...] and it may be a harbinger of bad things to come. Will's wife, Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), manages to drain all the fun out of Glee every time she appears." [...] Ryan received the younger cast more positively, stating that there were [...] "no weak links", and praising Colfer and Michele in particular.|$|E
500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness—for which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"—he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, and I discovered he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that will work on account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> will work. John, now, he's a take-charge guy... you what the other guy's going to do, what he's going to do, and what he wants you to do.|$|E

2500|$|The {{initiative}} to dramatize the novel {{was taken by}} two prop masters, Dag Alveberg and Petter Borgli. They both invested half a million Norwegian krone (NOK) in the project, financed by mortgaging their homes. Neither had any experience as producers. Alveberg stated that his main motivation was him being tired of all Norwegian films being social realism. He stated that [...] "the story could have taken place, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> has taken place. We all know that the Russians {{do what they want}} on Svalbard." [...] Alveberg first attempted to write the screenplay himself but was not satisfied. He presented the screenplay for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation; although they liked the project, they did not feel it was in the scope of the public broadcaster. Norway did not at the time have screenwriters of international standards, and Alveberg decided not to use his film as a training ground. He therefore hired the experienced British screenwriter Richard Harris.|$|E
