25|$|In ancient Greek mythology, King Sisyphus {{was sentenced}} to roll an enchanted boulder up a hill, only to stand just before the peak and watch it roll itself back down, and to repeat this action forever.

25|$|Aristotle argued {{at length}} against {{many aspects of}} Plato's forms, {{creating}} his own doctrine of hylomorphism wherein form and matter coexist. Ultimately however, Aristotle's aim was to perfect a theory of forms, rather than to reject it. Although Aristotle strongly rejected the independent existence Plato attributed to forms, his metaphysics do agree with Plato's a priori considerations quite often. For example, Aristotle argues that changeless, eternal substantial form is necessarily immaterial. Because matter provides a stable substratum {{for a change in}} form, matter always has the potential to change. Thus, if given <b>an</b> <b>eternity</b> in which to do so, it will, necessarily, exercise that potential.|$|E

25|$|Surrounded in mystery, {{the object}} of fear, hatred, and even worship {{by members of the}} Church of the Final Atonement (the Shrike Cult), the Shrike's origins are {{described}} as uncertain. It is portrayed as composed of razorwire, thorns, blades, and cutting edges, having fingers like scalpels and long, curved toe blades. It has the ability to control the flow of time, and may thus appear to travel infinitely fast. The Shrike may kill victims in a flash or it may transport them to <b>an</b> <b>eternity</b> of impalement upon an enormous artificial 'Tree of Thorns,' or 'Tree of Pain' in Hyperion's distant future. The Tree of Thorns is described as an unimaginably large, metallic tree, alive with the agonized writhing of countless human victims of all ages and races. It is also hinted in the second book that the Tree of Thorns is actually a simulation generated by a mystical interface which connects to human brains via a strong and pulsing (as if it were alive) cord.|$|E

500|$|According to Jains, all souls are {{intrinsically}} pure {{in their}} inherent and ideal state, possessing {{the qualities of}} infinite knowledge, infinite perception, infinite bliss and infinite energy. However, in contemporary experience, these qualities {{are found to be}} defiled and obstructed, on account of the association of these souls with karma. The soul has been associated with karma in this way throughout <b>an</b> <b>eternity</b> of beginningless time. This bondage of the soul is explained in the Jain texts by analogy with gold ore, which—in its natural state—is always found unrefined of admixture with impurities. Similarly, the ideally pure state of the soul has always been overlaid with the impurities of karma. This analogy with gold ore is also taken one step further: the purification of the soul can be achieved if the proper methods of refining are applied. Over the centuries, Jain monks have developed a large and sophisticated corpus of literature describing the nature of the soul, various aspects of the working of karma, and the ways and means of attaining [...]|$|E

500|$|Another {{account in}} this series is [...] "Ivan Turbincă", whose protagonist, a Russian serviceman, is shown rebelling against Heaven and Hell, and {{ultimately}} accomplishing the human ideal of cheating Death. The plot retells a theme present in both Romanian tradition and Ukrainian folklore, while, according to researcher of children's literature Muguraș Constantinescu, the main character is similar to German tradition's Till Eulenspiegel. In {{the beginning of the}} account, God rewards the soldier's exemplary charity by granting him a pouch (turbincă), which can miraculously trap anything in existence. In order to circumvent the laws of nature, Ivan subsequently makes use of both his magical item and his innate shrewdness. In one such episode, pretending not to understand the proper position of bodies inside a coffin, he tricks impatient Death into taking his place, and traps her inside. Eventually, he is allowed to keep his life, but is promised <b>an</b> <b>eternity</b> of old age, which he ingeniously counterbalances by attending an endless succession of wedding parties, and therefore never having to feel sad.|$|E

In {{an interview with the}} Manchester Evening News, Graham states that Sam is now in the afterlife, where time lasts <b>an</b> <b>eternity</b> compared to the suicide's duration of a few seconds: [...] "The truth is, when I wrote it, what I was trying to say is that he's died, and that for however long that last second of life is going to be, it will stretch out for an age, as <b>an</b> <b>eternity</b> for him.

2500|$|According to aggadic {{passages}} in the Talmud, God judges who has followed His commandments {{and who does}} not and to what extent. [...] Those who do not [...] "pass the test" [...] go to a purifying place (sometimes referred to as Gehinnom, i.e. Hell, but more analogous to the Christian Purgatory) to [...] "learn their lesson". There is, however, for the most part, no eternal damnation. The vast majority of souls only go to that reforming place for {{a limited amount of}} time (less than one year). [...] Certain categories are spoken of as having [...] "no part in the world to come", but this appears to mean annihilation rather than <b>an</b> <b>eternity</b> of torment.|$|E
2500|$|As spiritualism {{emerged in}} a Protestant Christian environment, it {{acquired}} features {{in common with}} Protestantism, ranging from its moral system to practices such as Sunday services and the singing of hymns. [...] Nevertheless, on significant points Christian Protestantism and spiritualism are different. [...] Spiritualists {{do not believe that}} the works or faith of a mortal during a brief lifetime can serve as a basis for assigning a soul to <b>an</b> <b>eternity</b> of Heaven or Hell; they view the afterlife as containing hierarchical [...] "spheres," [...] through which each spirit can progress. [...] Spiritualists differ from Protestant Christians in that the Judeo-Christian Bible is not the primary source from which they derive knowledge of God and the afterlife: for them, their personal contacts with spirits provide that.|$|E

2500|$|Cthulhu Mythos scholar Robert M.

Price also notes that Lovecraft admired the work of Lord Dunsany, who wrote The Gods of Pegana (1905), which depicts a god constantly lulled to sleep to avoid the consequences of its reawakening. Another Dunsany work cited by Price is A Shop in Go-by Street (1919), which stated [...] "the heaven of the gods who sleep", and [...] "unhappy are they that hear some old god speak while he sleeps being still deep in slumber".|$|E

[...] Williams would also later tell of one audition that she had during the late 1980s for a theatrical role. She was denied the role, however, because [...] "the wife of lyricist Ira Gershwin decreed: 'Over my dead body will that whore be in my show.'
