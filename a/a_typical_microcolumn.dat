50|$|The {{engine of}} an underbone is usually {{fixed to the}} chassis under the downtube, while a scooter usually has its engine mounted on its swingarm. As a result, underbone engines are usually further {{forwards}} than those of scooters. <b>A</b> <b>typical</b> underbone therefore has a more central centre of gravity than <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> scooter. Furthermore, having an engine mounted on the swingarm gives <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> scooter more unsprung mass than <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> underbone. These factors give <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> underbone better handling than <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> scooter.|$|R
