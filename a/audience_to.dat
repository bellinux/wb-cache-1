5|$|Sleight of hand during stage magic {{performances}} is not common, as most magic {{events and}} stunts are performed with objects visible {{to a much}} larger audience, but is nevertheless done occasionally by many stage performers. The most common magic tricks performed with sleight of hand on stage are rope manipulations and card tricks, with the first typically being done {{with a member of}} the <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> rule out the possibility of stooges and the latter primarily being done on a table while a camera is live-recording, allowing the rest of <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> see the performance on a big screen. Worldwide acclaimed stage magician David Copperfield often include illusions featuring sleight of hand in his stage shows.|$|E
5|$|Taking a {{page out}} of Chazz Palminteri's A Bronx Tale, Rosenbaum ignored the script during his final scene with Kristin Kreuk {{for the season}} six finale. Here, as Lana is informing Lex that {{she is going to}} leave, Lex walks around her and closes the door to her exit. Rosenbaum was trying to invoke a moment of fright for the <b>audience.</b> <b>To</b> the actor, he wanted the <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> wonder what Lex was going to do to Lana; it was a moment meant to show just how {{unpredictable}} Lex can be.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{begins with}} a futuristic {{character}} named Cuber (voiced by Emo Philips) announcing to the audience {{that they will be}} watching five short vignettes that are all unified by one theme. Cuber challenges the <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> then guess the theme.|$|E
5|$|Early {{suggestions}} were to show cutaways {{of just a}} {{small portion}} of the audience, but the full effect was achieved by only showing the back of the <b>audience.</b> <b>To</b> save time, most of the audience models were borrowed from the previous Pixar film, Ratatouille. Additionally, Presto's body (from the neck down) is Skinner's lawyer, and the carrot was one of the many food props from that film.|$|E

(1993), likewise designed <b>to</b> introduce <b>audiences</b> <b>to</b> classical music concertos.|$|R

5|$|Flynn {{has divided}} film critics. While some reviewers enjoyed the character's {{refreshing}} humor, rebelliousness and sarcasm {{in comparison to}} traditional Disney princes, others found his personality to be annoying and obnoxious, while panning his narration. Additionally, Flynn has also been strongly {{accused of being a}} marketing tool exploited by Disney to attract a larger male <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> Tangled. However, both the character's romantic comedy-esque relationship with Rapunzel and Levi's vocal performance have received widespread acclaim. Flynn is also considered to be among the most appealing Disney heroes by Vanity Fair, E! and Cosmopolitan.|$|E
5|$|In March 1973, The Concert for Bangladeshs {{significance}} was further underlined when it won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. In Harrison's absence, Ringo Starr attended the awards ceremony in Nashville and carried off {{a tray of}} Grammys, {{one for each of}} the featured performers. Author Peter Lavezzoli writes that, with the success of the live album and Saul Swimmer's concert documentary, which opened in US cinemas in March 1972, Indian classical music reached its largest Western <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> date through the Concert for Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|Just before 8 o'clock I saw Henry Wood take up his {{position}} {{behind the curtain}} {{at the end of}} the platform – watch in hand. Punctually, on the stroke of eight, he walked quickly to the rostrum, buttonhole and all, and began the National Anthem... A few moments for the <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> settle down, then the Rienzi Overture, and the first concert of the new Promenades had begun.|$|E

These contributions will feed into the future development of the piece.|$|R
5|$|Narayan's {{style is}} {{characteristic}} of Hindustani classical music, but his choice of solo instrument and his background of learning from teachers outside his community are not common for the genre. He has stated that he aims to please the audience and create a feeling of harmony, and expects the <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> reciprocate by reacting to his playing.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, 2012, on {{the episode}} hosted by Jonah Hill, Palin was {{impersonated}} by Andy Samberg in the Weekend Update segment. The dialogue leads the <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> {{think that it}} was supposed to be another appearance by Fey and that Seth Meyers wasn't aware of the change, but Samberg convinces Meyers to finish his part.|$|E
5|$|On stage, {{the band}} adopted a focused {{approach}} directly intended {{to increase the}} audience's concert experience. Johnny's instructions to C.J. when preparing for his first live performances with the group were to play facing the <b>audience,</b> <b>to</b> stand with the bass slung low between spread legs, and to walk forward {{to the front of}} stage {{at the same time as}} he did. Johnny was not a fan of guitarists who performed facing their drummer, amplifier, or other band members.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use of {{immersive}} and haptic experiences within concert dance and how these experiences enable <b>audiences</b> <b>to</b> co-author {{the meaning of a}} work through physical participation. Immersive experiences are generated when <b>audiences</b> are empowered <b>to</b> share a performance space with performers. Haptic experiences engage with our sense of touch and are fore fronted when <b>audiences</b> are allowed <b>to</b> move around within a performance. These kinds of experiences encourage co-authorship by empowering <b>audiences</b> <b>to</b> participate in and affect the outcome of performances. They also encourage co-authorship by prioritizing interpretations based on somatic and self-referential forms of knowledge...|$|R
5|$|Owen Hart's victory {{intensified}} his {{feud with}} his brother Bret. Having defeated him at WrestleMania X and replicated Bret's victory in the 1993 King of the Ring tournament, Owen {{set his sights on}} Bret's WWF World Heavyweight Championship. The two met at SummerSlam 1994 in a Steel Cage match for the title. Jim Neidhart was in the <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> support Owen. Davey Boy Smith, another brother-in-law of the Hart brothers, got involved with the feud by siding with Bret after Neidhart attacked Smith after the cage match.|$|E
5|$|The Turk {{made its}} debut in 1770 at Schönbrunn Palace, about six months after Pelletier's act. Kempelen {{addressed}} the court, presenting what he had built, and began the demonstration of the machine and its parts. With every showing of the Turk, Kempelen began by opening the doors and drawers of the cabinet, allowing members of the <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> inspect the machine. Following this display, Kempelen would announce that the machine {{was ready for a}} challenger.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} based on actual reports of {{conflict}} between the two nations. Hermione Norris made her final appearance as Ros Myers; the producers intended to leave her fate open {{in order for the}} <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> debate whether or not she survived the hotel explosion {{at the end of the}} episode. It was viewed by under six million viewers after its original broadcast, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews, particularly due to the reveal of Nightingale's plot and the cliffhanger, questioning whether or not Ros survived the hotel explosion.|$|E

5|$|Tsamere {{comes out}} of character, thanks the audience, writers and {{producers}} of the show, and explains that the preceding story is a fiction. He talks about his stage fright and goes off on a tangent about the bulbs around mirrors in dressing rooms; he asks a row of the <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> stand repeatedly to check whether pillars in the theatre are load-bearing. He ends by saying {{that he does not}} need the mirror, as he does not wear make-up.|$|E
5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E
5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E
