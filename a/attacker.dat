5|$|Motion {{camouflage}} is camouflage {{which provides}} a degree of concealment for a moving object, given that motion makes objects easy to detect however well their coloration matches their background or breaks up their outlines. The principal form of motion camouflage, and the type generally meant by the term, involves an attacker's mimicking the optic flow of the background as seen by its target. This enables the <b>attacker</b> to approach the target while appearing to remain stationary from the target's perspective, unlike in classical pursuit. The <b>attacker</b> chooses its flight path so as {{to remain on the}} line between the target and some landmark point. The target therefore does not see the <b>attacker</b> move from the landmark point. The only visible evidence that the <b>attacker</b> is moving is its looming, the change in size as the <b>attacker</b> approaches. Motion is also used in a variety of other camouflage strategies, including swaying to mimic plant movements in the wind or ocean currents.|$|E
5|$|An <b>attacker</b> having gained {{authentication}} material may impersonate the material's owner {{after the}} victim has patched Heartbleed, {{as long as}} the material is accepted (for example, until the password is changed or the private key revoked). Heartbleed therefore constitutes a critical threat to confidentiality. However, an <b>attacker</b> impersonating a victim may also alter data. Indirectly, Heartbleed's consequences may thus go far beyond a confidentiality breach for many systems.|$|E
5|$|The <b>attacker</b> {{consciously}} stops {{just short}} of hitting the training partner, while still executing attacks with full speed and power. The <b>attacker</b> has primary responsibility for non-contact, at a given moment during sparring, and this typically occurs when one training partner has more experience than the other. This is normally the practice when one training partner is a beginner.|$|E
30|$|Under {{the attack}} regime, {{we find that}} just few <b>attackers</b> are able to inflict {{considerable}} damage even when numerous genuine users react in real-time, giving the upper hand to <b>attackers.</b> However, we could not find conclusive evidence that the platform sustained a distributed attack from {{a large number of}} recruited <b>attackers.</b> This has an important consequence that only motivated <b>attackers</b> can be harmful.|$|R
50|$|When {{the local}} {{security}} team arrived, {{at first they}} mistook the <b>attackers</b> for IDF soldiers and called out to them. Responder Arik Becker {{was killed in the}} initial round of gunfire. Israeli police joined the security team, causing the <b>attackers</b> to flee. Ya’akov Katz was killed in a burst of gunfire while the <b>attackers</b> were running through the streets. The <b>attackers</b> fled {{through a hole in the}} security fence in the direction of the village of Tuffah. One of the <b>attackers</b> was later killed by IDF troops.|$|R
50|$|After the {{surviving}} <b>attackers</b> turned themselves {{over to the}} PA, the Palestinian Authority announced {{that they would not}} extradite the <b>attackers</b> to Israel. On January 22, 2008 the <b>attackers</b> were convicted in a Palestinian military court and sentenced to 15 years in prison each.|$|R
5|$|The {{strategy}} {{appears to}} work equally well in insects and in vertebrates. Simulations show that motion camouflage {{results in a}} more efficient pursuit path than classical pursuit (i.e. the motion camouflage path is shorter), whether the target flies {{in a straight line}} or chooses a chaotic path. Further, where classical pursuit requires the <b>attacker</b> to fly faster than the target, the motion camouflaged <b>attacker</b> can sometimes capture the target despite flying more slowly than it.|$|E
5|$|Ueshiba's {{goal was}} to create an art that {{practitioners}} could use to defend themselves while also protecting their <b>attacker</b> from injury.|$|E
5|$|A Ellis {{had not yet}} {{reached the}} bench to be {{replaced}} by an extra <b>attacker</b> (he even attempted to return to stop the puck) and thus the goal was credited as an official goal against Ellis, as opposed to an empty-net goal.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Interfax news agency, <b>attackers</b> were {{natives of}} Chechnya. They were not {{previously}} known to authorities. [...] Both the <b>attackers</b> were shot dead by police, one died instantly, {{while the other}} later succumbed to his injuries. The <b>attackers</b> did not have accomplices.|$|R
500|$|The <b>attackers</b> used a {{satellite}} phone {{and cell phones}} {{to talk to each}} other as well as their handlers that were based in Pakistan. [...] In transcripts intercepted by Indian authorities between the <b>attackers</b> and their handlers, the handlers provided the <b>attackers</b> with encouragement, tactical advice, and information gained from media coverage. The <b>attackers</b> used both personal cell phones and those obtained from their victims to communicate with each other and the news media. Although the <b>attackers</b> were encouraged to murder hostages, the <b>attackers</b> were in communication with the news media via cell phones to make demands in return for the release of hostages. This was believed to be done in order to further confuse Indian authorities that they were dealing with primarily a hostage situation.|$|R
50|$|A pair of fighters encountering {{one or two}} <b>attackers</b> {{will often}} use a {{defensive}} split. The maneuver consists of both defenders making turns in opposite directions, forcing the <b>attackers</b> to follow only one aircraft. This allows the other defender to circle around, and maneuver behind the <b>attackers.</b>|$|R
5|$|After hearing Teddy's exposition, Leonard {{consciously}} burns Jimmy's photograph, {{writes a}} message to himself on Teddy's photograph not to trust Teddy, and drives off in Jimmy's car. He has Teddy's license plate number tattooed as the second <b>attacker,</b> leading to his eventual death.|$|E
5|$|Ajmal Kasab was {{the only}} <b>attacker</b> arrested alive by police. Much of the {{information}} about the attackers' preparation, travel, and movements comes from his confessions to the Mumbai police.|$|E
5|$|Alternate {{theories}} of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to {{theories of}} just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume {{that the world is}} free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the <b>attacker,</b> and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the <b>attacker</b> is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the <b>attacker.</b>|$|E
30|$|User features: {{progress}} related. In {{order to}} make sure that suspected <b>attackers</b> were actual <b>attackers,</b> we have to look into the user features. Progress-related measures give a good indication of <b>attackers,</b> even though they are not perfect. No single user feature that is considered alone can group <b>attackers</b> together. It is remarkably also the case for progress. However, this feature as well as exploration and the number of pile ups can give a loose indicator.|$|R
50|$|Within a {{few days}} the <b>attackers</b> of Mrs Covey were arrested and a trial was held for the five known <b>attackers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Turner and Weed theorize {{that among}} the three main types of {{responders}} to workplace conflict are <b>attackers</b> who cannot keep their feelings to themselves and express their feelings by attacking whatever they can. <b>Attackers</b> are further divided into up-front <b>attackers</b> and behind-the-back <b>attackers.</b> Turner and Weed note that the latter [...] "are difficult to handle because the target person is {{not sure of the}} source of any criticism, nor even always sure that there is criticism." ...|$|R
5|$|Beyond Lincoln's {{death the}} plot failed: Seward was only wounded and Johnson's would-be <b>attacker</b> lost his nerve. After a {{dramatic}} initial escape, Booth was {{killed at the}} climax of a lengthy manhunt, and several other conspirators were later hanged.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{two girls}} {{were killed in}} Ramle by shots fired at a hall where Itzhak Abergil was celebrating. Police believe the slain girls were {{innocent}} victims of a mistake by the <b>attacker</b> in identifying his true target.|$|E
5|$|In Shodokan Aikido, randori differs {{in that it}} is not {{performed}} with multiple persons with defined roles of defender and <b>attacker,</b> but between two people, where both participants attack, defend, and counter at will. In this respect it resembles judo randori.|$|E
50|$|Several {{hours after}} the attack, a wake and {{symbolic}} funeral with hundreds of attendees was held for the <b>attackers</b> in the Al-Porkan mosque in Umm al-Fahm, which is affiliated with the Islamic Movement in Israel and in which the <b>attackers</b> prayed, in which the <b>attackers</b> were praised and called Shahids.|$|R
50|$|The four underage {{teenager}} <b>attackers</b> killed nine hotel guests. After a gunfight {{with the}} police, {{four of the}} <b>attackers</b> died in the shootout.|$|R
25|$|Twelve days later, two <b>attackers</b> stabbed {{people before}} detonating their suicide vests at an Ürümqi train station. Three people, {{including}} the <b>attackers,</b> were killed.|$|R
5|$|It {{is easier}} to attack than to defend. A {{defending}} mistake can have bigger consequences than an attacking mistake. Thus, the defender {{needs to be more}} precise, which in turn can lead to a time advantage for the <b>attacker.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{critical}} Mach {{number of}} the Spitfire's original elliptical wing was higher than the subsequently used laminar-flow-section, straight-tapering-planform wing of the follow-on Supermarine Spiteful, Seafang and <b>Attacker,</b> illustrating that Reginald Mitchell's practical engineering approach {{to the problems of}} high-speed flight had paid off.|$|E
5|$|The {{symmetric}} key is randomly generated {{and will not}} assist other victims. At no point is the attacker's private key exposed to victims and the victim need only send a very small ciphertext (the encrypted symmetric-cipher key) to the <b>attacker.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Ash <b>Attackers</b> - Armored lava monster {{soldiers}} made up {{of volcanic}} ash that wear horned helmets. Some of the Ash <b>Attackers</b> feature bat-like wings.|$|R
50|$|Twelve days later, two <b>attackers</b> stabbed {{people before}} detonating their suicide vests at an Ürümqi train station. Three people, {{including}} the <b>attackers,</b> were killed.|$|R
2500|$|After the van {{crashed on}} Borough High Street, the three <b>attackers</b> ran to Stoney Street {{adjoining}} Borough Market, where they stabbed {{four people in}} the Borough Bistro pub. Bottles and chairs were thrown at the <b>attackers</b> {{by members of the}} public. Witness claimed that the <b>attackers</b> were shouting [...] "This is for Allah".|$|R
5|$|There is some {{controversy}} concerning the widely reported imbalance of the game, as the rules strongly favor the king, {{although there are}} several rule modifications that can produce more balanced play, such as a weaponless king (the king cannot participate in captures), escape to the corners (rather than to the edges), or hostile <b>attacker</b> camps (the king and defenders may be captured against a vacant <b>attacker</b> camp square). Schmittberger (1992) even reveals some workarounds to produce more balanced play without modifying the rules of gameplay.|$|E
5|$|A common example {{might be}} {{following}} unauthorized network intrusion. A specialist forensic examination {{into the nature}} and extent of the attack is performed as a damage limitation exercise. Both to establish the extent of any intrusion and in an attempt to identify the <b>attacker.</b> Such attacks were commonly conducted over phone lines during the 1980s, but in the modern era are usually propagated over the Internet.|$|E
5|$|A {{man named}} Gianni Schicchi is only briefly {{referred}} to in Dante's Inferno Canto XXX. In that canto, Dante visits the Circle of Impersonators and sees a man savagely attacking another. Dante is told that the <b>attacker</b> is Schicchi, condemned to Hell for impersonating Buoso Donati and making his will highly favorable to Schicchi.|$|E
50|$|The <b>attackers</b> at Garhi Shahu, {{including}} two would-be suicide bombers, entered the mosque without any resistance, before storming into the prayer halls firing guns, throwing grenades. The assault at Model Town involved two <b>attackers</b> opening fire on worshippers before exploding hand grenades. The <b>attackers</b> weren't taking any hostages and were killing indiscriminately.|$|R
50|$|Later on the Shin Bet {{claimed that}} the <b>attackers</b> ambushed the {{travelers}} in the wadi, in order {{to carry out the}} attack. When one of the <b>attackers</b> spotted the travelers approaching the wadi he immediately reported it to his the other <b>attackers,</b> whom came over and assisted him carrying out the attack.|$|R
