2500|$|As {{the waters}} receded, flooded {{buildings}} were inspected by [...] "strike teams" [...] before owners {{were allowed to}} return <b>and</b> <b>check</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> damage. They used a color-coded system.

In biggest problems with homes were collapsing basements or foundations. In cases where water had reached the first floor or higher, there was failure of the floor joists, leading to a sagging or collapse into the basement. The Time Check neighborhood is particularly hard hit, where several hundred homes {{were said to be}} beyond salvation and will be demolished.|$|E

50|$|The city of Niš, in the {{southeast}} of Serbia, {{is one of the}} oldest cities in Europe and has long been an important bridge between East and West. Two millennia ago, it was used as a link between modern-day Belgrade and Istanbul. In a historical sense, it is most famous for being the birthplace of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great. It is a city with a chaotic history spanning several centuries - much of it dark, but undeniably historically significant. Nis is a great city to learn about Serbia’s history, and is a good home base from which to see some of the country’s best ancient ruins. In the heart of the city is the Nis Fortress. This 18th century construction is situated along the shore of the Nišava River, atop the ruins of the ancient Roman military camp, Naissus. The fortress was built during Turkish rule (1386 - 1878) as was regarded as one of the most beautiful buildings in the Balkans. The Nis Fortress was used as an armory, hammam (bath), and prison. Much of the original building is still standing. It is a free attraction where people are welcome to stroll the paths <b>and</b> <b>check</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> remaining constructions within. Inside there are restaurants, ice cream vendors, and stages where the main programs of Nišville Jazz Festival are held each year in August.|$|E
