Following the Boltzmann <b>type</b> <b>control</b> recently introduced in [1], we consider a group of opinion leaders which modify their strategy accordingly to an objective func-tional with the aim to achieve opinion consensus. The main feature of the Boltzmann <b>type</b> <b>control</b> is that, thanks to an instantaneous binary control formulation, it permits to embed the minimization of the cost functional into the microscopic leaders interac-tions of the corresponding Boltzmann equation. The related Fokker-Planck asymptotic limits are also derived which allow to give explicit expressions of stationary solutions.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of Ocimum gratissimum (O. gratissimum) and Vernonia amygdalina (V. amygdalina) with those of insulin and glibenclamide. Methods: Type I and II diabetes mellitus (DM) were induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of 65 mg/kg of streptozotocin and intraperitoneal administration of nicotinamide (100 mg/kg) along with streptozotocin, respectively. The state of diabetes was confirmed weekly by testing blood glucose level using a glucometer. Results: The weekly blood glucose levels were higher in type I DM than in type II DM. Type I DM plus O. gratissimum showed a weekly progressive significant reduction in blood glucose compared to <b>type</b> I DM <b>control.</b> <b>Type</b> I DM <b>control</b> showed a duration dependent significant higher blood glucose concentration compared to normal <b>control.</b> <b>Type</b> I DM plus V. amygdalina also showed a time dependent significant lower glucose level compared to normal <b>control</b> and <b>type</b> I DM <b>control.</b> Combination treatment of type I DM (O. gratissimum plus V. amygdalina) showed a significantly elevated glucose concentration compared to normal control which was similar to <b>type</b> I DM <b>control.</b> Insulin treatment in type I DM showed a weekly progressive significant reduction of glucose concentration compared to normal <b>control</b> and <b>type</b> I DM <b>control.</b> <b>Type</b> II DM <b>control</b> showed a fairly constant blood glucose concentration throughout the duration of treatment that {{was significantly higher than}} that of the normal <b>control.</b> <b>Type</b> II DM plus O. gratissimum showed a fairly steady significant reduction of glucose concentration compared to <b>type</b> II DM <b>control</b> and normal <b>control.</b> <b>Type</b> II DM plus V. amygdalina also showed a fairly constant significant reduction of glucose concentration compared to <b>type</b> II DM <b>control</b> and normal <b>control.</b> <b>Type</b> II DM (O. gratissimum plus V. amygdalina) showed a slightly progressive significant reduction of glucose concentration compared to normal <b>control</b> and <b>type</b> II DM <b>control.</b> <b>Type</b> II DM with glibenclamide showed almost steady significant reduction in glucose concentration compared to normal <b>control</b> and <b>type</b> II DM <b>control.</b> Conclusions: From the result, it is evident that O. gratissimum and V. amygdalina administration produces more potent hypoglycemic activity than insulin and glibenclamide in type I and II DM models, respectively...|$|R
