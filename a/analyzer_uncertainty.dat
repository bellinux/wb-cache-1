40|$|Abstractâ€”A two-layer {{nondestructive}} {{method for}} characterizing the electric and magnetic properties of lossy conductor-backed magnetic materials using a flanged rectangular-waveguide probe is examined. The two reflection measurements {{necessary to determine}} both permittivity and permeability are made by first applying the probe to the material under test and then applying the probe to a known-material layer placed {{on top of the}} material under test. The theoretical reflection coefficient is obtained using a rigorous full-wave solution, and an extrapolation scheme is used to minimize the error due to truncating the modal expansion of the waveguide fields. An error analysis is performed to compare the performance of the technique to the two-thickness method, which utilizes two different thicknesses of the material under test. The properties of the known material layer that result in the least error due to network <b>analyzer</b> <b>uncertainty</b> are determined. The sensitivity of the two-layer method is also explored and discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{method that}} calculates the {{residual}} uncertainties of a microwave network analyzer for the frequency range of 300 kHz to 50 GHz is described. The method utilizes measurements on NIST-certified standards (such as an airline or load) plus additional measurements {{to estimate the}} combined standard uncertainties for measurements using the network <b>analyzer.</b> The <b>uncertainties</b> of the standards are incorporated {{by means of a}} Monte Carlo technique. The uncertainties assigned to a network analyzer then provide the basis for estimating the uncertainties assigned to devices measured using a network analyzer. The results of this method for characterizing network <b>analyzer</b> <b>uncertainties</b> are presented for several connector types...|$|R
40|$|When {{noise is}} used as a {{diagnostic}} tool to determine the reliability of a device, not only the noise parameters itself, but also the uncertainty in these noise parameters are important. For good devices, this uncertainty will be Gaussian. However, because of non-linear measurement errors caused by a digital spectrum <b>analyzer,</b> this <b>uncertainty</b> might deviate from Gaussianity. We have estimated this additional error through simulations. We conclude that this error can often be ignored...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{continuation}} of studies using a two-pulsed technique for Ablative Laser Propulsion (ALP) extended to force measurements in vacuum. Aluminum samples were ablated using pairs of laser pulses, each of 100 ps width, 532 nm wavelength and 5 mJ energy. The pulses were temporally separated in the 0 - 0. 67 ns range. The force imparted on Al targets was measured in situ by means of a piezoelectric force gauge. The preliminary results confirm the previously reported oscillatory behavior of ion velocity and number density observed by means of a time-of-flight energy <b>analyzer.</b> The <b>uncertainties</b> of presented measurements and future directions for the study are discussed...|$|R
40|$|An Outer Planets Probe which {{retains the}} charred {{heatshield}} during atmospheric descent must deploy a sampling tube through the heatshield to extract atmospheric samples for analysis. Once the sampling tube is deployed, the atmospheric samples ingested must {{be free of}} contaminant gases generated by the heatshield. Outgassing products such as methane and water vapor are present in planetary atmospheres and hence, ingestion of such species would result in gas <b>analyzer</b> measurement <b>uncertainties.</b> This paper evaluates the potential for, and design impact of, the extracted atmospheric samples being contaminated by heatshield outgassing products. Flight trajectory data for Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus entries are analyzed to define the conditions resulting in the greatest potential for outgassing products being ingested into the probe's sampling system. An experimental program is defined and described which simulates the key flow field features for a planetary flight in a ground-based test facility. The primary parameters varied in the test include: sampling tube length, injectant mass flow rate and angle of attack. Measured contaminant levels predict the critical sampling tube length for contamination avoidance. Thus, the study demonstrates the compatibility of a retained heatshield concept and high quality atmospheric trace species measurements...|$|R
40|$|This book {{describes}} vector network <b>analyzer</b> {{measurements and}} <b>uncertainty</b> assessments, particularly in waveguide test-set environments, {{in order to}} establish their compatibility to the International System of Units (SI) for accurate and reliable characterization of communication networks. It proposes a fully analytical approach to measurement uncertainty evaluation, while also highlighting the interaction and the linear propagation of different uncertainty sources to compute the final uncertainties associated with the measurements. The book subsequently discusses the dimensional characterization of waveguide standards {{and the quality of the}} vector network analyzer (VNA) calibration techniques. The book concludes with an in-depth description of the novel verification artefacts used to assess the performance of the VNAs. It offers a comprehensive reference guide for beginners to experts, in both academia and industry, whose work involves the field of network analysis, instrumentation and measurements...|$|R
40|$|Mining {{trajectory}} datasets {{has many}} important applications. Real trajectory data often involve uncertainty due to inadequate sampling rates and measurement errors. For some trajectories, their precise positions cannot be recovered and the exact routes that vehicles traveled cannot be accurately reconstructed. In this paper, we investigate the uncertainty problem in trajectory data and present a visual analytics system to reveal, analyze, and solve the uncertainties associated with trajectory samples. We first propose two novel visual encoding schemes called {{the road map}} <b>analyzer</b> and the <b>uncertainty</b> lens for discovering road map errors and visually analyzing the uncertainty in trajectory data respectively. Then, we conduct three case studies to discover the map errors, to address the ambiguity problem in map-matching, and to reconstruct the trajectories with historical data. These case studies demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of our system...|$|R
