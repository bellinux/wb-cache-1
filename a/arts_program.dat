5|$|The visual <b>arts</b> <b>program</b> {{includes}} drawing, painting, photography, sculpting, digital art, and art history. The {{program is}} highly structured, emphasizing technique {{and control over}} free expression, which has attracted criticism from the local art community. Art students receive individualized instruction, participate in art exhibits and competitions, undertake commissioned work, and work at in-house galleries and off-site exhibits. Most art majors take Advanced Placement art courses {{by the end of}} their sophomore year, and many attend pre-college programs at major universities between their high school years.|$|E

40|$|The problem. A. Numerous {{articles}} and theoretical essays {{have been written}} since 1965 regarding <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> for inner-city populations. B. Funds from various agencies have been alloted for <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> in large cities. In public school settings {{and outside of the}} public school domain <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> have been implemented. Although single program outcomes appear in literature, no major compilation of data has been made, which provides insight or an overview of the entire scope of <b>art</b> <b>programming</b> within a given location or comparing <b>art</b> <b>programming</b> of one city to another. Procedure. Correspondence was made to cities selected for this study as well as to Federal and state institutions for information regarding <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> and curricula. Findings. The findings are based on responses to two questions: 1. How do <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> in the Des Moines area com-pare with <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> that exist in some major cities across the U. S. ? 2. Based upon research and recent literature, do <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> in the Des Moines area and across the country meet the needs of inner-city children? It was found that <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> in Des Moines do com-pare favorably with inner-city programs in some major cities. It also was found that most <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> in Des Moines and other major cities, have a distinct weakness in meeting the needs of inner-city children. Conclusion. It was concluded that the strengths of <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> warrant some merit, but the weaknesses, based upon a lack of change, present a cause for major concern. Recommendations. Three alternatives were recommended: (I) the establ:ishrnent of a Black Art and Culture Center in Des Moines, Iowa, (2) the adoption of an Art Action Center in the Des Moines Public Schools, and (3) the development in the Des Moines inner-city schoolS of a new approach to teaching inner-city children through a coordinated art curriculum...|$|R

5|$|Following this, Wilfrid {{moved to}} a ranch in the {{emerging}} settlement of Orion, Alberta with his family {{on the advice of}} a neighbor; the farming of wheat was a predominant activity. However, following a major crop failure in 1917, he became the town's bank clerk after employment in a convenience store, but later left for Kronau, Saskatchewan due to a combination of poor business and boredom; the family ranch was later abandoned in 1923. After skipping several years of high school education through a fast-track course at Regina College, Eggleston enrolled for a Bachelor of <b>Arts</b> <b>program</b> at Queen's University in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Many of the extracurricular {{activities}} offered at ACS offer {{an extension of}} classroom subjects and an opportunity for students to pursue those studies in additional depth. Within the <b>arts</b> <b>program,</b> chorus, creative writing, drama, art, and three levels of orchestra are offered as optional activities. Students in these groups have opportunities to perform and exhibit their work throughout the year. The Book Club is available to students in groups six and above to extend the reading program. Computer Club, Creative Writing Club, Art Club, French Film Club, and Drama Club also offer opportunities to build on classroom activities.|$|E

5|$|In 1905, when Macdonald was 15, {{the family}} moved to the town of Port Hood, Cape Breton. Macdonald {{attended}} the Port Hood Academy. He hoped to enroll next in the Bachelor of <b>Arts</b> <b>program</b> at St Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, but his family couldn't afford to pay for a university education so Macdonald obtained a teaching licence and taught for two years to finance his education. Midway through his university studies, he took another year off to earn money teaching. He completed his final term on credit and was required to teach in the university's high school during 1914–15 to pay off his debt. Macdonald did well at St. FX. He played rugby, joined the debating team, edited the student newspaper and, in his graduating year, won the gold medal in seven of his eight courses. He was also class valedictorian.|$|E
5|$|The Empire Arts Center, in {{downtown}} Grand Forks, {{is home to}} several cultural events throughout the year. The Empire, a 1919 movie theater, was restored after the Flood of 1997 and now includes performance space, a large movie screen, a gallery, and space for artists. The Fire Hall Theatre, also downtown, is used by community members to put on several theater productions each year. The Summer Performing Arts Company (SPA) is a popular summer <b>arts</b> <b>program</b> for area K-12 students. SPA stages three major musicals mid-July. The Myra Museum, on Belmont Road near the Greater Grand Forks Greenway, is a small history museum with exhibits that trace local history from the Ice Age, through settlement, and into the modern age. Other buildings on the Myra Museum grounds include the original 1868 Grand Forks Post Office, a 1917 one room school, and the historic Campbell House.|$|E
5|$|While Sawyer {{was serving}} overseas, the reform {{coalition}} swept the Democrats into power in Philadelphia {{for the first}} time in 67 years. When he returned to Philadelphia, Clark asked him to run for an at-large seat on City Council in 1955. By the rules of the limited voting system for the at-large seats, each political party could nominate five candidates and voters could only choose five. The result was that the majority party could take only five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. Sawyer was elected to one such seat and served a single four-year term. In that position, he sponsored legislation to establish the city's One Percent for Fine <b>Arts</b> <b>program,</b> which required one percent of the cost of construction projects in Center City to be spent on public art. He also worked for the creation of a Police Review Board. City Council did not pass that bill, but Mayor James Tate later created the board through an executive order.|$|E
50|$|The city {{began as}} a center of crude oil production, was later {{propelled}} by citrus production, and is now an important retail center {{because of the large}} Brea Mall and the recently redeveloped Brea Downtown.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 97 - 106) The {{purpose of}} this project is to describe the essential characteristics of <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> for children in hospitals. Historically, concerns about the needs of hospitalized children began {{to emerge in the}} 1920 's with the development of the first play <b>programs.</b> <b>Art</b> <b>programs</b> in hospitals did not begin to occur until much later, in the early 1970 's. The importance of art for children in school and in the hospital is explored and provides a foundation for the development of <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> for children in hospitals, with emphasis ort the early childhood period of growth and development. A review of the literature reveals that art and play for the hospitalized child are of vital importance for his growth and development. However, <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> for children in hospitals are far and few between. Existing hospital <b>art</b> <b>programs</b> for children and adults in the United States and abroad are therefore an integral part of this project. The role and funding of the artist-in-residence is vital to the functioning of hospital <b>arts</b> <b>programs.</b> A collection of art projects which have been done with children in hospitals is included in the Appendix in the hopes that it will be useful to those working with children in hospitals...|$|R

5|$|The UChicago <b>Arts</b> <b>program</b> joins {{academic}} {{departments and}} {{programs in the}} Division of the Humanities and the College, as well as professional organizations including the Court Theatre, the Oriental Institute, the Smart Museum of Art, the Renaissance Society, University of Chicago Presents, and student arts organizations. The university has an artist-in-residence program and scholars in performance studies, contemporary art criticism, and film history. It has offered a doctorate in music composition since 1933 and in cinema and media studies since 2000, a master {{of fine arts in}} visual arts (early 1970s), and a master of arts in the humanities with a creative writing track (2000). It has bachelor's degree programs in visual arts, music, and art history, and, more recently, cinema and media studies (1996) and theater and performance studies (2002). The College's general education core includes a “dramatic, musical, and visual arts” requirement, inviting students to study the history of the arts, stage desire, or begin working with sculpture. Several thousand major and non-major undergraduates enroll annually in creative and performing arts classes. UChicago is often considered the birthplace of improvisational comedy as the Compass Players student comedy troupe evolved into The Second City improv theater troupe in 1959. The Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts opened in October 2012, five years after a $35 million gift from alumnus David Logan and his wife Reva. The center includes spaces for exhibitions, performances, classes, and media production. The Logan Center was designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. This building is actually entirely glass. The brick is a facade designed to keep the glass safe from the wind. The architects later removed sections of the bricks when pressure arose in the form of complaints that the views of the city were blocked.|$|E
