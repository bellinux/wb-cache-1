This study aims {{to investigate the}} types of teacher’s code-switching found in <b>an</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>classroom,</b> to investigate functions of code-switching used by the teacher in <b>an</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>classroom</b> and to investigate conditions where the teacher can do code-switching in <b>an</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>classroom.</b> To achieve these objectives, the study employs a descriptive qualitative method. The data are obtained from classroom observations from a class consisting 30 students and a teacher’s interview. The data are descriptively analysed. The result {{of this study is}} in line with Poplack (1980, cited in Jingxia, 2010), there are three types of code-switching, there are six functions of code-switching and there are seven conditions where the teacher can do code-switching. The findings of the study are expected to contribute to the efforts in the teaching and learning area as an alternative way in teaching English by implementing code-switching and to change the teachers’ paradigm about the use of L 1. The findings are also expected to be beneficial for researchers who want to conduct similar research. Keywords: Code-switching, L 1, <b>EFL</b> <b>classroom...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractOne of the {{fundamental}} problems many English language teachers face with is enhancing L 2 learners’ reading ability and maintaining their interest in reading. Most L 2 learners have certain difficulties while reading in English since they {{are not aware of}} the effective ways of reading and understanding a text, which might cause resistance and affect their attitudes towards reading in English. Thus, research emphasizes the importance of instruction on graphic organizers (GOs) to promote reading in a second (L 2) or foreign (FL) language (Fly, Jean & Hunter, 1988; Ellis, 2004; Amin, 2004). The present study investigates the possible effects of instruction on four concrete graphic organizers (GOs) on students’ application of those visual displays in a text, and examines their attitudes towards reading in <b>an</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>classroom.</b> Data coming from pre and post questionnaires, focus group interviews and think alouds revealed congruence between instruction on graphic organizers and learners’ attitudes towards reading in <b>an</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>classroom...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: Literature {{has been}} {{utilized}} as teaching material in both medical and nursing {{education in the}} U. S. and U. K. for in-training healthcare professionals to grow personally and/or to enhance their empathy. In English as <b>a</b> Foreign Language (<b>EFL)</b> settings also, literature has been regarded as effective learning material that enhances students'empathy as well as language ability. These trends lead {{us to believe that}} literature in <b>an</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>classroom</b> is <b>a</b> potentially powerful tool as learning material for Japanese in-training healthcare professionals. The aims of this paper are to clarify what a reading course with a medically-themed novel could bring students based on findings obtained through content analysis, and to then show the significance of literature contributing to improved empathy among students in <b>an</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>classroom.</b> Methods : <b>A</b> descriptive questionnaire was conducted with 98 students who wrote what their thoughts changed after reading the medically-themed target literature. Content analysis according to Berelson was used for data collection and analysis. Results : Analysis of the students'comments revealed eight categories : "attitudes toward the way of living and death and/or dying,""the way of reading English novels,""motivations for reading English books and learning English,""understanding the feelings of patients and the people around them, and attitudes toward both of them,""attitudes toward cross-cultural understanding,""interest in movies," and "understanding medical things such as diseases. " Conclusions : The use of literature in the reading course brought about positive changes in students in terms of language, culture and personal growth, and most importantly, nourished the students'empathy, which is required both in medical professions and in the <b>EFL</b> <b>classroom.</b> 目的:英米の看護教育及び語学教育における文学の活用の現状に基づいて,日本の医療系学生対象の英語授業においても文学は有用な教材としての可能性を持つと考える. 本研究の目的は、医療をテーマとした文学作品を活用した英語講読授業において,医療系学生の語学学習の役割とともに共感力向上の一助となる文学の可能性を検証することである. 方法:最終授業後に依頼した学生（ 4 クラス、 98 名）による自由回答式質問に対する記述を,ベレルソンの内容分析を用いてコード化し,どのような点において自己変化を認識したかについて分析した. 結果:コード化された記述は, 8 つのカテゴリーに分類された. その中に,共感力の向上につながる可能性を示唆するカテゴリーを見出すことができた. 結論:医療系学生にとって,文学作品は,語学や異文化に対する認識を高めると同時に,疑似体験を通じて共感力を高める一助となる有意義な教材としての可能性をもっていることが示唆された.

Therefore, teachers and students in the teaching/learning process {{do not have to}} get surprised when they commit such errors. Everyday in the learning process learners are prone to make errors whenever they try to express new utterances. Teaching English to students in intermediate level is a challenge because everyone has different interests and needs so teachers should look for several ways of motivating them to get interested in the acquisition of the second language. Besides that, teachers {{have to take into account}} that in this level speaking errors are committed frequently since students have not had enough contact with the target language and some of them are still in the basic level. During the leaning process students commit different kinds of errors such as; omission, addition, ordering and selection.

Simultaneously, an educational aim followed the study in order to clarify the pedagogical possibilities of using the narratives in <b>an</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>classroom.</b>     The findings of the present inquiry indicate great similarities in the change of circumstances between Miriam and Liesel due to the war, which consequently impacted the individuals in their basis of developing their personal self. The results disclosed several instances in which the surroundings of Darvas and Meminger hindered their ability to develop and deprived them of the necessities needed, according to Maslow’s theory. However, they also disclosed indications of finding inner strength by self-improvement through education. Therefore, the findings from the present study supports an area of pedagogical possibilities using the narratives in the <b>EFL</b> <b>classroom,</b> such as enhancing the knowledge and understanding for the living conditions during the Holocaust, providing alternative reading suggestions to the commonly used Holocaust literature, as well as allowing collaborations between several subjects in high school...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{classroom}} action research which conducted in <b>an</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>classroom.</b> The problem {{of this study}} is that teaching and learning process tends to be monotonous due to the single method used by English teachers. The learners` speaking course is familiarized with English structures. It requires a communicative and constructive method such as TBLT. The purpose {{of this study is}} to describe the effectiveness of TBLT in enhancing students` speaking skill. 30 EFL learners at the seventh semester at STAIN Kerinci took a part in this study. The instruments used to collect the data were speaking test, observation, and field-note. The results of the study showed that there were 2 cycles needed to implement the method. The process of teaching and learning in the first cycle indicates that TBLT improved learners` speaking skill, though some problems were needed to be solved. Unlike the cycle I, the process in the cycle II was improved in term of learners` speaking score and their motivation to attend the course if compared with those in cycle I. So, it is concluded that TBLT is an appropriate method to improve learners` speaking skill...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the students’ attitudes towards activities used in <b>an</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>classroom</b> in one Thai university. The research participants include the students of first year (bachelor students of medical and engineering faculties) who had studied public speaking subject as their minor in second semester. The data was collected through class observations and semi structured interviews. In <b>classroom</b> observations, <b>EFL</b> learners’ perceptions and satisfactions on their teacher using class activities were recorded in the field-notes and questions related to EFL learners’ attitudes in target language learning based on certain factors that include better teaching strategies, classroom activities and social environment that can help reduce or change negative attitudes were asked through interview. This study found promising results on the students’ attitudes towards teacher using activities. More {{than half of the}} participants regarded teacher’s using activities that determined their success in language learning. However, {{less than half of the}} participants showed dissatisfying factor that related to the EFL teacher using humor on their cultures as the part of his teaching. This research paves a way for future research by indicating issues and questions for researchers to address...|$|R
40|$|This study maps 130 Chinese EFL learners’ {{development}} of academic literacy through a focused examination of grammatical metaphor (GM), the key linguistic resource for achieving the language valued {{in the academy}} (Christie, 2002 a; Christie & Derewianka, 2008; Halliday, 1994). This corpus-assisted, longitudinal study of Chinese learners’ exposition texts combines the delicate descriptions of Systemic Functional Linguistic (SFL) with the empirical resources of Corpus Linguistics, resulting in a detailed mapping of learners’ development informed through a multi dimensional framework of GM analysis. This close diachronic examination of learners’ use of experiential GM reveals salient patterns of deployment and maps detailed pathways of development. These detailed pathways are informed by quantitative patterns of frequency and variation, and qualitative patterns of metaphorical control, or the degrees of completeness and control over a reconstrual, and metaphorical enrichment, the degrees of technicality, formality and meanings committed to the metaphor (Liardét, 2013, 2014 a). The paper identifies the obstacles Chinese EFL learners most frequently face when developing the resources of incongruent language to cohesively structure their texts in nominally-oriented, lexically dense, cause and effect networks, providing insights into how <b>an</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>classroom</b> may better equip learners to develop these critical resources. 18 page(s...|$|R
