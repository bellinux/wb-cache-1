2500|$|She {{has spoken}} {{out on a}} number of {{volatile}} political issues, including tort/litigation reform, but perhaps her most consistent theme—aside from gay and lesbian rights—has been her unstinting opposition to Communism, and unrelenting opposition to the former Eastern Bloc power structure that compelled her to flee her native Czechoslovakia. She has denounced the Soviet Union's control over Czechoslovakia, maintaining that she refuses to speak Russian to this day because of the Soviet Union's former hegemony over Eastern Europe."Whenever people go into politics and they try to say that Communism was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> say, 'Go ahead and live in a Communist country then, if you think it's so great.'

6000|$|... "Well, land is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> admit, and it's {{right there}} should be an owner to it; yet there are folks who would rather squat than buy or hire, any day. Squatting comes nat'ral to 'em." ...|$|E
5000|$|While the German example's moral relativism {{has led to}} {{a lesser}} {{political}} fascism, others have questioned whether politics of memory is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>Is</b> it that [...] "Those who cannot remember the past, are doomed to repeat it?" [...] Literature in the past has largely ascertained that it is so.|$|R
6000|$|... "But that's--I've {{been feeling}} so jumpy lately, I thought maybe {{it might be}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> if <b>I</b> kind of got off by myself and sweat it out of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's good! That's--sit down; sit down!--that's <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> assure you, I don't think it's {{the least}} use, though I do both. My boy doesn't, he's a pattern to his father." ...|$|R
60|$|The girl {{pointed to}} the door without saying anything, and the dark man left the room. And then she came over and cried around me again. It's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> had enough rubber in me to be water-proof.|$|E
6000|$|... "By thunder! {{but that}} was {{something}} I hadn't bargained for!" [...] murmured the great scout, as he surveyed the carcass. [...] "That's about the biggest wildcat I ever saw. It's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> didn't meet him in the dark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It'd be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> reckon. But you mustn't {{forget your}} milkin'. I dunno what our cow'd do this morning if it wasn't for Joey. But he'll milk her, him and Benny Hingston, between them, somehow. Benny {{stayed with him}} last night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{think it}} is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> should know," [...] Charlie agreed thoughtfully. [...] "I daresay it is all right, but, at any rate, I am glad you told me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If I {{must say}} what I think," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Rushworth, [...] "in my opinion {{it is very}} disagreeable to be always rehearsing. It is having too much of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> am not so fond of acting as I was at first. I think we are a great deal better employed, sitting comfortably here among ourselves, and doing nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know quite}} enough {{of what he}} says, Hermy--quite as much, I dare say, as you do. But, never mind. If Lord Ongar has given up smoking, I quite {{agree with you that}} it's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> wish they'd all give it up, for I hate the smell of it. Hugh has got worse and worse. He never cares about {{changing}} his clothes now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Birdseye {{had been}} {{watching}} her blue car, the advance of which was temporarily obstructed. At this, she transferred her eyes to him, gazing at him solemnly out of the pervasive window of her spectacles. [...] "Well, I shouldn't wonder if she did! Yes, that will be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> don't {{see how you can}} help being a good deal shaken by her. She has acted on so many." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But now, {{to return}} to what we were {{speaking}} of--my future plans," [...] said I; [...] "it {{seems to me that}} it would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> if <b>I</b> were to travel for a year or so and see the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "First," [...] he began, [...] "I want to {{compliment}} {{you on your}} new paper. It's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> and <b>I</b> like it. It's what's been needed in these 'ere parts a long time, and it's talked about all over Chazy County." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The rules be bothered," [...] {{replied the}} irate Maria. [...] "I {{thought it was}} Mr. Smiley. He's been away from his parish for a week, and there are <b>a</b> <b>good</b> many <b>things</b> <b>I</b> want to ask him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and it's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> didn't {{lose the}} money when I tried to. You see, mother, what I hadn't {{realized}} {{was the good}} {{that could be done}} with all that money if a man put his heart into it. They can start in as soon as they like and tear down those buildings. My! but it's just wonderful {{what you can do with}} money. I'm glad I didn't lose it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Tommy showed great cunning. [...] "Pretend {{you have}} eggs in your hand," [...] {{he whispered to}} Grizel, and then, in a loud voice, he said: [...] "Think shame of yoursel', lassie, for harrying birds' nests. It's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> saw you, and brought you here to force you to put them back. Is that you, Elspeth? I catched this limmer wi' eggs in her hands (and the poor birds sic bonny singers, too!), and so I was forcing her to--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cut 'em all out," [...] went on Jacob. [...] "I've quit being <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> {{need every}} dollar I can scrape or save. I {{want you to}} write to the {{directors}} of every company that I'm interested in and recommend a 10 per cent. cut in salaries. And say--I noticed half a cake of soap lying {{in a corner of}} the hall as I came in. I want you to speak to the scrubwoman about waste. I've got no money to throw away. And say--we've got vinegar pretty well in hand, haven't we?' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The new {{technology}} promises a structural shift ('democratization' {{is a word}} they use) in the reader's favor, giving him an exaggerated role in the give-and-take between artist and audience. He is to be given choices so he can 'interact' with the narrative. <b>Is</b> this <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing?</b> <b>Is</b> our every reader a worthy collaborator or does his involvement dilute the whole process? Do we, as readers, want this? This is where the 'entertainment media' at large is headed: to pander to the impatient lout and to provide him with material that ranges only from masturbation fodder to the narrative equivalent of a roller-coaster ride." [...] (pp. 13-14) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{reminds me}} that I haven't thanked you," [...] said Dusky. [...] "I knew there was {{something}} wrong over here, but I didn't know what. So it was a hunter. I guess it is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> heeded your warn-ing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, there," [...] said he. [...] "You go too fast, you go too fast, Mr. Balfour. It is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> {{have learned}} to be more patient. And I believe you forget that I {{have yet to see}} my daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 30th.--After I {{had written}} you, I re-read my hurricane, {{which is very}} poor; {{the life of the}} {{journalist}} is hard, another couple of writings and I could make <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> believe, and it must go as it is! But, of course, this book is not written for honour and glory, and the few who will read it may not know the difference. Very little time. I go down with the mail shortly, dine at the Chinese restaurant, and go to the club to dance with islandresses. Think of my going out once a week to dance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'll have to explain, because I don't {{know what}} to do. Lansing gave me a tip to buy some shares, and when some friends said I'd got <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> went to him again. I must say he was pretty guarded, but I got a hint and acted on it, {{with the result that}} I have dropped a good deal of money. This," [...] he added deprecatingly, [...] "is {{not the kind of thing}} I should talk to you about, but I was told that Lansing couldn't receive any callers, and you'll see why you should know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Now,' says I, 'you'd better {{stay in bed}} {{for a day or}} two, and you'll be all right. It's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{happened}} to be in Fisher Hill, Mr. Mayor,' says I, 'for all the remedies in the cornucopia that the regular schools of medicine use couldn't have saved you. And now that error has flew and pain proved a perjurer, let's allude to a cheerfuller subject--say the fee of $250. No checks, please, I hate to write my name {{on the back of a}} check almost as bad as I do on the front.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose not, your Grace. But as I and Silverbridge are {{together}} in this matter I thought I'd just let your Grace know {{that we ought to}} have had <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> thought that perhaps your Grace might like to know that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There are <b>a</b> <b>good</b> many <b>things</b> <b>I</b> had {{rather do}} than poke my nose into a hornet's nest," [...] I replied, {{feeling as if}} Jerry was in some way my enemy because he {{appeared}} to be so delighted with the situation.|$|R
2500|$|Bow remembered: [...] "All {{this time}} I was 'running wild', I guess, {{in the sense}} of trying to have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time... maybe this was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> because <b>I</b> suppose <b>a</b> lot of that excitement, that joy of life, got onto the screen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{he is just}} as ugly as he looks," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "There isn't <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can say for him, not one. He doesn't {{belong in}} this country at all. He was brought here by man, {{and now he is}} found everywhere. He is {{sometimes}} called the Norway Rat and sometimes the Wharf Rat and House Rat. He is hated by all animals and by man. He is big, being next in size to Jerry Muskrat, savage in temper, the most destructive of any animal I know, and dirty in his habits. He is an outcast, but he doesn't seem to care.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't do {{them in my}} own name, you know," [...] he {{observed}} lightly, at last laying down his bow, and replacing the dainty white rose in his left top buttonhole. [...] "Not official for a bank EMPLOYE to operate on the Stock Exchange. The chiefs object to it. So I do my little ventures in Tom's name instead, my brother-in-law, Tom Whitley's. Those Cedulas went up another eighth yesterday. Well hit again: I'm always lucky. And that was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> put you on last week, too, wasn't it? Did you sell out to-day? They're up at 96, and you bought in at 80." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, Wilfrid," [...] Mr. Atherton laughed, [...] "it is {{possible}} to have too much of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> might jog along with a colonial force well enough and benefit by it, but Rapata and his men would kill me in a week. I do not think those fellows {{know what it is}} to be tired. No, I am very well contented, and I intend to do no end of work in the woods and keep myself down to my present weight. There is an immense deal to be done in the way of botanizing. I have already found twelve new sorts of ferns, and I have only just begun, and have not even looked at the orchids yet or the mosses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wondered}} how he got them," [...] said Mr. Archibald, [...] "but I am glad you carried them to him." [...] Then, speaking to his wife, he added, [...] "It may be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> gave {{him a chance to}} assert his individuality." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{impossible}} to have too much of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> But <b>I</b> must not look any more. Though Agatha says she does not love me, I {{am not sure that}} she would be pleased if I were to look for love from anyone else." ...|$|R
