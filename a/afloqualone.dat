50|$|<b>Afloqualone</b> (Arofuto) is a quinazolinone family GABAergic {{drug and}} is an {{analogue}} of methaqualone developed in the 1970s by a team at Tanabe Seiyaku. It has sedative and muscle-relaxant effects resulting from its agonist activity at the Î² subtype of the GABAa receptor , and has had some clinical use, although it causes photosensitization as a side-effect that can cause skin problems such as dermatitis.|$|E
40|$|Eperisone and <b>afloqualone</b> act by {{relaxing}} both skeletal and vascular smooth {{muscles to}} improve circulation and suppress pain reflex. These drugs are typically prescribed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as painkillers. However, {{there have been}} no reports on serious adverse reactions to oral muscle relaxants; {{and this is the first}} report to describe three allergic reactions caused by eperisone and <b>afloqualone.</b> All three patients had histories of allergic reactions after oral intake of multiple painkillers, including oral muscle relaxants and NSAIDs, for chronic muscle pain. An open-label oral challenge test was performed with each drug to confirm which drugs caused the systemic reactions. All patients experienced the same reactions within one hour after oral intake of eperisone or <b>afloqualone.</b> The severity of these reactions ranged from laryngeal edema to hypotension. To confirm that the systemic reaction was caused by eperisone or <b>afloqualone,</b> skin prick testing and intradermal skin tests were performed with eperisone or <b>afloqualone</b> extract in vivo, and basophil activity tests were performed after stimulation with these drugs in vitro. In one patient with laryngeal edema, the intradermal test with <b>afloqualone</b> extract had a positive result, and CD 63 expression levels on basophils increased in a dose-dependent manner by stimulation with <b>afloqualone.</b> We report three allergic reactions caused by oral muscle relaxants that might be mediated by non-immunoglobulin E-mediated responses. Since oral muscle relaxants such as eperisone and <b>afloqualone</b> are commonly prescribed for chronic muscle pain and can induce severe allergic reactions, we should prescribe them carefully...|$|E
40|$|<b>Afloqualone</b> (6 -amino-fluoromethyl- 3 - 0 -tolyl- 4 -(3 H) -quinazolinone), a {{striated}} muscle relaxant, {{was administered to}} eighteen patients with detrusor-external urethral sphincter dyssynergia due to neuropathic disepse. The efficacy of the drug was judged from the objective deta by non-transurethral urodynamic studies such as simultaneous measurement of intra-abdominal pressure, tone of anal sphincter, EMG of anal sphincter, urinary flow rate and voiding volume. As the result of urodynamic deta, 56 % of the patient treated with <b>Afloqualone</b> showed improvement in urodynamic parameters. <b>Afloqualone,</b> if used in combination with a-blocking agent or B-stimulant, would be useful {{for the treatment of}} the patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction, particularly with hyperreflexic urethral sphincter and detrusor-external urethral sphincter dyssynergia...|$|E
40|$|The central {{muscle relaxant}} {{activity}} of the antispastic agent tizanidine was {{compared with that of}} two novel clinical agents, <b>afloqualone</b> and eperisone, in the mouse and rabbit. Oral tizanidine strongly inhibited morphine-elicited Straub tail induction in the mouse, showing a me-dian effective dose {EDsJ of 1. 2 mg/kg, Intravenous tizanidine also inhibited hind limb extensor reflex activity in the rabbit with an EDso of 0. 02 mg/kg. <b>Afloqualone</b> and eperisone, however, were much weaker in the mouse assay with EDso values of 8. 2 and 58. 1 mg/kg, re-spectively. At respective intravenous doses of 2. 0 and 1. 0 mg/kg, <b>afloqualone</b> and eperisone caused maximally 32 % and 41 % inhibition of reflex activity in the rabbit. On this basis, <b>afloqualone</b> might be ex-pected to exhibit moderate myotonolytic activity in rheumatological indications, but to be of questionable value in spasticity. Similarly, clinical myotonolytic activity of eperisone would only be expected at high doses unless its functional bioavailability were to be much better in man than in either the mouse or rabbit.

40|$|<b>Afloqualone</b> (AFQ) {{is one of}} the {{centrally}} acting muscle relaxants. AFQ N-glucuronide is {{the most}} abundant metabolite in human urine when administered orally, whereas it was not detected in the urine when administered to rats, dogs, and monkeys. Species differences in AFQ N-glucuronidation were investigated with liver microsomes obtained from humans and experimental animals. The kinetics of AFQ N-glucuronidation in human liver microsomes showed a typical Michaelis-Menten plot. The Km and Vmax values accounted for 2019 85. 9 M and 871. 2 17. 9 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. The Vmax and intrinsic clearance (CLint) val-ues of AFQN-glucuronidation in human liver were approximately 4 -to 10 -fold and 2 - to 4 -fold higher than those in rat, dog, and monkey, respectively. Among 12 recombinant human UDP-glucu-ronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms, both UGT 1 A 4 and UGT 1 A 3 ex-hibited high AFQ N-glucuronosyltransferase activities. The Km value of AFQ N-glucuronidation in recombinant UGT 1 A 4 micro-somes was very close to that in human liver microsomes. The formation of AFQ N-glucuronidation by human liver, jejunum, and recombinant UGT 1 A 4 microsomes was effectively inhibited by tri-fluoperazine, a known specific substrate for UGT 1 A 4. The AFQ N-glucuronidation activities in seven human liver microsomes were significantly correlated with trifluoperazine N-glucuronida-tion activities (r 2 0. 798, p< 0. 01). In contrast, the Km value of AFQ N-glucuronidation in recombinant UGT 1 A 3 microsomes was rela-tively close to that in human jejunum microsomes. These results demonstrate that AFQ N-glucuronidation in human is mainly cat-alyzed by UGT 1 A 4 in the liver and by UGT 1 A 3, as well as UGT 1 A 4 in the intestine...|$|E
