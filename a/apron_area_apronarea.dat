40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{automatic}} and adaptive aircraft target detection algorithm in high-resolution {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) images of airport. The proposed method is based on gradient textural saliency map under the contextual cues of <b>apron</b> <b>area.</b> Firstly, the candidate regions with the possible existence of airport are detected from the <b>apron</b> <b>area.</b> Secondly, directional local gradient distribution detector is used to obtain a gradient textural saliency map {{in the favor of}} the candidate regions. In addition, the final targets will be detected by segmenting the saliency map using CFAR-type algorithm. The real high-resolution airborne SAR image data is used to verify the proposed algorithm. The results demonstrate that this algorithm can detect aircraft targets quickly and accurately, and decrease the false alarm rate...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose in}} this study is to analyze the {{optimization}} of aircraft parking stands, and proposed model for apron development in near future at Sultan HasanuddinInternational Airport (SHIA) to achieve safety on airport operation activities. The study was conducted by collecting and analyzing data. The data were based on field survey, interviews, discussion with airport authority, official government, etc. and also from various agencies. Analytical tools applied were: regression analysis, to forecasts passenger and aircraft movements; and JICA formulas, to analyze the aircraft movement at peak hours, and number of aircraft parking stands for short, medium, and long terms period. The conclusion are: (a) the optimizing level on the <b>apron</b> <b>area,</b> especially at peak hours at SHIA depends on the aircraft service time, (b) the ability to serve the aircrafts on the <b>apron</b> <b>area</b> at peak hours as many as 17 to 22 aircraft parking stands, and need additional space as much as 24, 431 m 2, 39, 216 m 2, and 52, 354 m 2 in 2015, 2020 and 2025 respectively, (c) requirement to develop/introduceother aircraft parking stands model, (d) proposed the new apron or aircraft parking stands model as known as pier or satellite models to anticipate the increasing number of passenger and aircraft movements in the near future; while the recommendation can be included that the use of service time as effectively and efficiently at the <b>apron</b> <b>area</b> could provide better service for passengers, aircrafts...|$|R
