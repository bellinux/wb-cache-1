40|$|At least 167 {{women are}} raped {{every day in}} the UK, yet rape {{remains one of the most}} under {{reported}} and least prosecuted of all violent crimes. Low conviction rates can be attributed in part to the failings of the criminal justice system including the infiltration of rape myths into said system and the ambiguity surrounding sexual consent. This thesis has drawn on data generated from eighteen semi-structured interviews and one focus group with men who have been convicted of (acquaintance) rape/aggravated rape. In doing so, this research has utilised critical discursive psychology to analyse the ways in which ‘rape myths’ and knowledge of sexual consent, coercion and refusal is incorporated into participants’ <b>offence</b> <b>accounts.</b> Findings suggest that offenders employ a variety of rape myths when <b>accounting</b> for their <b>offence</b> in accordance with particular issues of stake and interest. All of which is tied to the management of identity, sentence type and treatment received. Subscription to rape myths was often relatively subtle and was based on offenders’ accounts of their mens rea (or lack thereof) or their consumption of drugs and/or alcohol, rather than primarily about the culpability of their victim as the more historic rape myths might suggest. Furthermore, through <b>offence</b> <b>accounts,</b> participants were able to demonstrate a sophisticated articulation and appreciation of sexual refusals and negotiations through their ability to ‘hear’ sexual refusals which did not involve the word ‘no’ - reinforcing the subtle nature of sexual communication. These findings highlight that ‘knowledge’ of rape myths needs to be contemporised and that the legislation surrounding consent needs to incorporate all its subtleties. All of which has implications for the treatment of sexual offenders...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{has sought to}} explore the theoretical context of community treatment programmes for those convicted of sexual offences against children in the United Kingdom. The aim was also to explore the application of this theoretical framework to one such programme run by a probation service. The research was longitudinal employing a combination of methodological techniques. Psychometric testing and Ninety seven depth interviews were employed {{with a small group}} of offenders over a period of four years in order to explore the impact of the programme. Offender <b>accounts</b> of <b>offence</b> circumstance were compared to victim statements and other records; semi-structured interviews were undertaken with practitioners. A review of the literature regarding the historical and legislative context of work with child sexual abusers and the validity of the theoretical framework guiding cognitive behavioural work was undertaken. The research largely supports the theoretical basis of such work. The findings suggest that child sexual abusers; have a tendency to attribute blame to offence circumstances and victims; probably have enduring low self esteem from childhood; tend to be socially isolated both in childhood and in adulthood, and are often ostracised by family and friends as a consequence of their offending; experience problematic relations with others from an early age; are likely to be emotionally, physically or sexually abused as children. The treatment programme was successful in addressing blame attribution, there was greater congruence between victim and offender <b>accounts</b> of <b>offence</b> circumstance at the end of the research. Government legislation for this offender group has become increasingly punitive, seeking simultaneously to monitor and control, with no provision for therapeutic work on termination of a probation order or custodial sentence...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: On {{the basis}} of {{detailed}} <b>accounts</b> of <b>offences</b> committed by 12 dangerous sexual offenders and of descriptions of their life histories, their responses to various tests, self-reports of offenders’sexual interests and activities, and results of phallometric evaluations, 15 expert forensic psychiatrists diagnosed whether each offender met the criteria for sexual sadism. The psychiatrists also indicated their confidence in the diagnoses they made and rated the rele-vance to the diagnosis of sexual sadism for various features of the offence and the offender. Results revealed unsatisfactory levels of diagnostic agreement among the psychiatrists. On the other hand, they agreed quite well on the importance for the diagnosis {{of several of the}} offence features described. Suggestions are offered for clinical practice. The authors (Marshall & Kennedy, in press) have previously reviewed an exten-sive literature that describes both the concept of sexual sadism and research relat-ing to that concept. Inconsistencies across reports indicated that different authors were using different definitions of sexual sadism.

40|$|Abstract — Recent {{literature}} documents extensive substance misuse histories among US female prison inmates. The {{primary purpose}} of the present study was to determine whether histories of personal and familial substance misuse distinguished female inmates from substance misusers in treatment. After <b>accounting</b> for drug-related <b>offences,</b> we hypothesized that the inmates would have more extensive histories of personal and familial substance misuse and that they would have initiated substance use at an earlier age. Contrary to our expectations, the two samples were similar on many measures of alcohol and drug use. Similarly, differences in family histories of substance misuse were not in the predicted direction. As hypothesized, however, the inmates did report earlier age at onset of drinking. Of particular clinical relevance was the finding that, despite similar alcohol consumption levels, inmates reported fewer alcohol-related adverse medical, legal, and psychosocial consequences than did the treatment sample...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a critique of}} the concept of cognitive distortion as it has been developed within the domain of sex-offender treatment programme theory and practice. Drawing upon a discursive psychology perspective, it is argued that cognitive distortions should not be considered as mental entities but as social practices. This argument is illustrated by closely examining how offenders’ <b>accounts</b> of their <b>offences</b> during sex offender treatment sessions were organised. Recordings and transcriptions of treatment group sessions were analysed for the occurrence of regular patterns of talk and interaction. This analysis focused on how minimisation was achieved through well documented rhetorical and conversational devices (conversational repair, narrative contrast devices). An orientation to cognitive distortions as a resource was also illustrated through examining its use by group members to admonish a focus offender and through a narrative reflexivity device. These findings suggest that the notion of cognitive distortion and its role in treatment settings should be reconsidered. Furthermore, it is suggested that a discursive psychology perspective can also make a highly relevant contribution to the evaluation of treatment group processes and that further research is needed in order to examine in detail the way that treatment groups are socially organised...|$|R

Level 3 theories seek to detail the offence process and are used to build higher level theories. The main theories developed to understand sexual offending behaviour have not included the voices of sexual offenders with an ID. This study aimed to {{bridge this gap by}} exploring the offence process of men with an ID who sexually offend against children. It examined the reasons that participants gave for their offending behaviour and aimed to develop a theoretical model of the explanations that participants gave for their offending behaviour, including its onset, development and maintenance. A qualitative design was employed and the data from 12 participants was analysed using Grounded Theory. A tentative model was developed where seven major categories and the central category emerged. The model did not reach saturation. It places reasons/attitudes at the centre of the model, as these were found to relate to every category, and were {{at the heart of the}} participants' explanations of the development and maintenance of the offences.

In 2003 and 2008, the Australian Institute of Criminology delivered a clear message: despite {{the relatively low}} number of incidents compared to non - violent crime, serious v iolent crime <b>offences</b> <b>account</b> for {{a substantial portion of}} the costs of crime in Australia (Mayhew, 2003; Rollings, 2008). Moreover, a number of scholars have demonstrated a decline in police clearance of serious violent crime over recent decades (Horvath et al., 2001; Litwin & Xu, 2007; Riedel, 2008). Although investigation and responding to serious violent crime are core components of police work, the evidence - base for police investigative techniques for serious violent crime lacks the level of evaluation and synthesis seen for other policing interventions which have been predominantly assessed according to their impact on general crime and disorder. This systematic review aims to redress this imbalance by conducting the first ever systematic review focusing on the effectiveness of techniques that police use to investigate serious violent crime. Our review examine s the evidence on police investigative techniques for serious violent crime to determine what works, what doesn’t, and for what crime types.

Diogenes Laërtius has preserved an account in which Bion describes his parentage to Antigonus II Gonatas, King of Macedonia. His father was a freedman and a dealer in salt fish, with which he combined the occupation of smuggling. His mother, Olympia, was a Lacedaemonian prostitute. The whole family were sold as slaves, on <b>account</b> of some <b>offence</b> committed by the father. In consequence of this, Bion fell into the hands of a rhetorician, who made him his heir. Having burnt his patron's library, he went to Athens, and applied himself to philosophy, in the course of which study he embraced the tenets of almost every sect in succession. First he was an Academic studying under Xenocrates and Crates of Athens, then he became a Cynic, (perhaps under Crates of Thebes), afterwards he attached to Theodorus, the Cyrenaic philosopher whose alleged atheism is supposed to have influenced Bion, and finally he became a pupil of Theophrastus the Peripatetic. After the manner of the sophists of the period, Bion travelled through Greece and Macedonia, and was admitted to the literary circle at the court of Antigonus II Gonatas. He subsequently taught philosophy at Rhodes, and died at Chalcis in Euboea.|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates {{offences}} {{of online}} sexual grooming {{and abuse of}} children via Internet technologies. The literature review of online child sexual exploitation (Chapter 1) demonstrated {{that there is a}} lack of research studying this phenomenon using real-world data. This is followed by four empirical chapters (Chapters 2 - 5). Chapter 2 reports on a study that examined offenders’ (n = 5) modus operandi as part of sexually exploitative interactions with victims through transcripts of chat logs. Interactions were of a highly sexual nature, in which offenders used a range of manipulative strategies to engage victims. In Chapter 3, a descriptive <b>account</b> of the <b>offence</b> processes of these interactions (n = 29) is provided. Offenders employed either an indirect or a direct approach, further reflected in the types of strategies they used. Two offenders (indirect) engaged in aspects of sexual grooming; the majority of interactions by the other three offenders (direct) lacked features thereof. Chapter 4 examined victims’ (n = 22) behaviour and responses to approaches by offenders within their interactions. Most victims appeared to engage therein out of curiosity and sexual exploration/experimentation, while other victims presented with vulnerability factors (e. g., personal/psychological problems, sexual abuse experiences) that may have made them more vulnerable to contact by offenders, leading to serious offences of sexual abuse. Finally, to gain a fuller understanding of offenders’ point of view, their lived experiences of sexual grooming offences were explored through qualitative interviews (Chapter 5). Offenders employed narratives of ‘being trapped in a lie’ and ‘repenting a moral error’, through which they described the meaning they attach to these experiences. The overall discussion (Chapter 6) considers the findings of the review and research, and concludes with a discussion of limitations, implications and areas for future research...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the experiences of}} relatives of those accused or convicted of serious offences such as murder, manslaughter, rape and sex <b>offences.</b> Relatives' <b>accounts</b> focus on {{the discovery of the}} offence as traumatic and life-changing, comparable in many ways to bereavement. Accounts of life before this point polarised and were either problem-identifying or normalising. Participants passed through several stages after discovering the offence as they began to feel they were coping and as the criminal justice process progressed. Responsibilities within the family were renegotiated and new responsibilities emerged which particularly revolved around the offender and his or her needs. Female relatives, and primarily mothers and wives, tended to take on these new tasks. Relatives experience secondary stigma because of their kin relationship to a serious offender, but this {{is more than just a}} stigma by association. Relatives are themselves subject to a 'web of shame' on the basis of contamination and blame. The thesis explores the accounts that relatives construct about the offence and about their own actions. When <b>accounting</b> for the <b>offence,</b> relatives were found to use 'actor adjustments' and 'act adjustments' of various types. Many participants were searching around for reasons and trying to understand why the offence had happened; formulating these accounts was part of that process. The thesis considers why relatives use self-help and what it offers. It is argued that self-help provides a 'collective narrative' for understanding experience which relatives use as a resource along with other sources to understand their circumstances. Most participants in the research were female, as are most participants in self-help services for relatives of offenders, and reasons for this are considered. The thesis is based upon in-depth interviews with 32 relatives of serious offenders and participant observation of a self-help organisation for families of serious offenders over several years...|$|R

Specific objectives of the study includes to determine the emission level in the country, to evaluate the GWP and to develop a emission mapping network on trunk A roads in Nigeria. Accurate information on these emissions is required to strengthen the mitigation and adaptation ability of the country to tackle climate change. The study relied on direct measurement technique supported by literature as well as questionnaires administered on the organised vehicle fleet operators and road traffic management agency as data gathering methods. Also, detailed analysis of questionnaires responses was carried out. Results show that road transport account for over 14 % of greenhouse gases. Survey findings indicate that excessive smoke emission <b>offence</b> <b>accounts</b> for 1 - 2 % of the annual road traffic offences in Nigeria. Using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version 16, five fitted simple linear regression models were developed. With these fitted models it is possible to map the gas concentrations on the kilometre travelled. Examination of the National Vehicle Identification Scheme (NVIS) revealed a rise in the periodic plate number generation from yearly record of 788, 169 in 2001 to 791, 832 in 2009. Human capacity requirements, based on yearly Drivers Licence (DL) processed, increased by 55 % between 2000 and 2010. Three mutual strategies namely renewed urban and rural road transport infrastructure availability, regular fleet maintenance and capacities building for improved behavioural change of road users were recommended to help control road transport emissions. These measures if inflexibly implemented will change the transport sector from being a major global warming risk factor to that of Eco-friendly sector...|$|R

Rwanda’s {{economic performance}} {{is vulnerable to}} shocks, in particular a sharp fall in aid flows. The domestic financial sector still faces a poor environment with economic activity concentrated in a few sectors and a weak credit culture. There are serious shortcomings in the accounting and auditing systems and the institutional, legal, and judicial frameworks.

40|$|The recent {{failures}} of corporations such as Enron, WorldCom and HIH Insurance, to name but a few, have heightened investor {{awareness of the}} need to not only evaluate company performance, but also to consider the possibility that financial statements may not be a true reflection of company results, as fraudulent activities may have occurred during the reporting period. Since parties who are external to the firm {{do not have access to}} pertinent information, they have to rely upon published financial and non-financial data in order to form an opinion regarding performance and/or the risk that fraudulent activities may have occurred. The objective of this study is to determine if published information contains critical factors that could indicate if a company is at risk of fraud. The prior literature shows a relationship between weak corporate governance and the occurrence of earnings management and/or fraudulent activities, although most if not all of this research relates to Western economies. The differences in institutional setting e. g. cultural values and legal environment in Malaysia would not give the same findings with the study in western economies. Composing of many ethnic, Malaysian is a multicultural country. With each ethnic group upholding its own culture, values and belief, business are conducted according each ethnic’s culture. The results of this study could shed some light on the influence of institutional setting on corporate governance and earnings management practices. There is not much research on corporate fraud in Malaysia; therefore, this study will focus on the Malaysian economy and examine the relationship between corporate governance, earnings management and corporate fraud. Companies that were charged with <b>accounting</b> and auditing <b>offences</b> from year 2003 to 2007 were selected as the fraudulent sample. Data were collected for the year companies were charged with fraud and the year prior to that. Both univariate analysis and logistic regression analysis were carried out to determine the significant differences between fraudulent and non-fraudulent companies with respect to corporate governance characteristics and earnings management indices. The results indicated that the size of the board and the percentage of institutional shareholdings had significant relationships with the likelihood of corporate fraud occurrences consistently across the two-year period studied. The results on earnings management showed only that the gross margin index had a significant relationship with the likelihood of corporate fraud consistently over the five-year period studied. The study also found that fraudulent companies adopted income increasing method in time of difficulty which is consistent with past study in other countries for gross margin (lower gross margin index). The results of this study will assist public, corporate and accounting policy makers in formulating more effective corporate governance mechanisms and financial reporting systems...|$|R
40|$|The Kingdom of Bahrain’s Financial System Stability Assessment {{highlights}} banking supervision, insurance supervision, securities regulation, and antimoney laundering and combating {{the financing}} of terrorism. The banking sector is well capitalized. Asset quality has been improving and provisioning is high. Profitability surged in 2004 – 05, but historically, return on equity has been moderate for many institutions. Favorable liquidity conditions have caused regional equity and real estate markets to surge. Consumer lending has grown rapidly, although it slowed in 2005 following a tightening of loan to income limits.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} Hungary’s antimoney laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism measures. The Hungarian authorities have made significant progress in strengthening their AML regime. The most important step has been {{the passage of a}} revised AML Act of 2003, replacing the 2001 revision of the original 1994 AML Act. With this, the legislative framework for AML is in place, and has been extended to nonfinancial businesses and professions. Financial institutions’ compliance with the AML requirements is well supervised, and they are well aware of their obligations under the Act.
