40|$|The current {{use of the}} Arkansas Standard Specifications for Highway Construction Manuals (2003, 2014) for {{driven pile}} {{foundations}} faces various limitations which result in designs of questionable reliability. These specifications {{are based on the}} Allowable Stress Design method (ASD), cover a wide range of uncertainties, do not take into account pile and soil types, and were developed for general use. To overcome these challenges it is deemed necessary to develop a new design and <b>acceptance</b> <b>protocol</b> for driven piles. This new protocol incorporates locally calibrated RLFD resistance factors for accounting for local design and construction experiences and practices, as well as specific soil conditions and pile types. In that perspective, this dissertation focuses on the design and acceptance of driven pile foundations (predominately for bridge projects) using an LRFD protocol. A great deal of insight is gained into the factors that contribute to the performance of deep foundations by conducting an extensive literature review. The research assembled a relatively large database of pile load tests where both static and dynamic load testing was performed and sufficient soils information existed to perform static design calculations. A MATLAB® based program was developed to use the information contained in the database to compute resistance factors for driven piles using the First Order Second Moment Method (FOSM), Improved FOSM, the First Order Reliability Method (FORM), and Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS). The research also addressed a technique to update resistance factors using Bayesian techniques when new load tests are added to the database. More importantly the dissertation formulated a design and <b>acceptance</b> <b>protocol</b> that seeks to unify the level of reliability for deep foundations through both the design and construction phases. As a verification mechanism to the developed design and <b>acceptance</b> <b>protocol,</b> a full-scale pile load testing program was recommended. The testing program would be composed of ten driven piles that had been dynamically and statically load tested. It was found that, for the same required reliability level, acceptance criteria could be lowered if more piles are tested on a jobsite. Subsequently, a non-contact instrument¬-such as Pile Driving Monitoring device-is recommended to verify in situ pile capacity of each and every pile on construction site. The results from in situ pile capacity verification could be employed to update the calibrated resistance factors and to refine future designs...|$|E

Methods An anonymous, 15 -question, Likert-scale question-naire (scores 1 - 5) was used to determine the opinions of staff about donation after brain death and after cardiac death in a pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary-care university hospital. Results Survey response rate was 67 % (n = 60).

Despite wide-spread <b>protocol</b> <b>acceptance,</b> duration of effectiveness of vaccines in protecting horses from disease is not well documented. It was hypothesized that horses vaccinated annually since birth have increased antibody production that remains consistent and sufficient for long-term protection from common diseases. This work resulted {{in the development of}} a novel, multiplex-magnetic bead-based indirect immunoassay to screen sera from vaccinated adult horses to measure antibody levels in response to vaccine administration. Antigens tested included West Nile Virus, Eastern Equine Encephalitis, Western Equine Encephalitis, Equine Influenza Virus, Equine Herpes Virus 1 and 4, Tetanus, and 7 different Rabies antigens (3 lab and 4 wild strains). The developed assay was a 7 -plex capture antibody, which quantified equine IgG (Immunoglobulin G) that binds viral antigens derived from different rabies virus strains along with pure vaccine samples of the 7 different antigens. A 7 -point standard curve was developed to quantify the viral-antigen reactive IgG concentration in vaccinated horse serum. Vaccinated horses increased serum antibody concentration for each antigen post-vaccination with the percent increase ranging between 34. 0 % for Equine Herpes Virus 4 and 257. 3 % for Equine Influenza Virus. Use of the novel assay will provide equine veterinarians with an economical method to measure immune activation toward common pathogens of concern.

In addition, participants were either actively encouraged, or not, to link pain tolerance with pursuit of valued goals to examine the impact of pursuing a personally meaningful goal or value {{on the extent to which}} pain will be tolerated. Methods: Participants in experiment 1 (n= 41) and experiment 2 (n= 52) were equally assigned to <b>acceptance</b> or distraction <b>protocols.</b> Further, half the participants in each group generated examples from their own lives in which they had pursued a valued objective, while the other half did not. In experiment 2, the values focus was enhanced to examine the impact on pain tolerance. Results: There were no significant differences overall between the acceptance and distraction groups on pain tolerance in either experiment. However, in experiment 2, individuals classified as accepting in terms of general coping style and who were assigned to the acceptance strategy showed significantly better pain tolerance than accepting individuals who were in the distraction condition. Across both experiments, those with strong goal-driven values in both protocols were more tolerant of pain. Participants appeared to have more difficulty adhering to acceptance than to distraction as a strategy. Conclusion: Acceptance may be associated with better tolerance of pain, but may also be more difficult to operationalize than distraction in experimental studies.

40|$|DTM 2011 handbook/programme {{is given}} in files and also {{available}} as a hard copy Objective: Insulin sensitivity (SI) tests can provide important information for type 2 diabetes risk assessment and investigations of metabolism or pre-diabetes. Our group previously presented the dynamic insulin sensitivity and secretion test (DISST) and the real-time quick DISST (DISTq) as low-cost, low-burden and accurate alternatives to established tests. The DISST provides concurrent SI and endogenous insulin secretion (UN) metrics, the DISTq does not require insulin or C-peptide assays for SI identification, but can return an immediate result. This study validates the DISST and DISTq {{in comparison to the}} euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp (EIC) Method: Fifty participants (with 10 BMI> 30; 10 BMI> 25, < 30; and 5 BMI< 25 of each gender) underwent the EIC and DISST. The DISST protocol requires 5 samples from a 30 minute protocol similar to the IM-IVGTT. Data from the DISST protocol was sufficient to identify SI using both the DISST and DISTq parameter identification methods and UN from the DISST. Result: DISST and DISTq SI values correlated well to the EIC (R= 0. 81 and R= 0. 76, respectively) and each other (R= 0. 84). UN values obtained during the DISST showed clinically relevant distinctions between participants, and clearly differentiated the beta-cell function of impaired glucose tolerant participants who had the same EIC SI. Participant <b>acceptance</b> of the <b>protocol</b> was high with very minor reported adverse effects. Conclusion: The DISST and DISTq correlated well against the EIC compared to most established insulin sensitivity tests.

It varied over time between 55. 56 % (5 / 9) in the period from 2001 to 2004, to 87. 50 % (7 / 8) from 2005 to 2008, to 62. 50 % (5 / 8) from 2009 to 2011 and 75. 00 % (6 / 8) from 2012 through 2014 (all studies: 50 % [5 / 10], 88. 89 % [8 / 9], 62. 50 % [5 / 8], 63. 64 % [7 / 11], respectively). The Niamey protocol was applied also in 2 / 5 hospital studies in 282 / 544 (51. 84 %) patients. The usefulness of the WHO protocol for S. haematobium infections is confirmed by its worldwide acceptance. Some simplifications might facilitate its use also for focused ultrasound examinations performed by less skilled examiners.

40|$|Over 9 million Mg {{of waste}} foundry sands (WFS) are {{produced}} {{annually in the}} United States as a by-product of the metal casting industry. The majority of WFS are deposited in restricted or sanitary waste landfills. Considerable savings is available to the metal casting industry {{through the development of}} reuse applications for their WFS and generators are often willing to provide WFS to a job site at no cost to the end user. 	Laboratory investigations have indicated that WFS from ferrous foundries can provide the necessary engineering properties for a highway embankment and that the MicrotoxTM bioassay test can be used to screen the “toxicity” of WFS to prevent a negative environmental impact. In 1996, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) and Purdue University constructed a demonstration embankment using WFS. WFS and control embankments were instrumented to monitor geotechnical and environmental performance. Stockpile and job site “grab” WFS samples were also tested. 	Detailed geotechnical results are presented in a companion report by Fox and Mast (1998). In general, results indicate that WFS can perform well as a structural fill with strength and deformation characteristics comparable to natural sand, but cannot be considered as freely draining. Environmental testing consisted of MicrotoxTM and Nitrotox bioassays, ion chromatography, and inductively coupled plasma testing for metals. Bioassay results indicate the WFS have not resulted in inhibitions (toxicity) higher than those expected from natural sands. Ion migration from the WFS into the foundry sand lysimeter was found, supporting bioassay data, but at concentrations below reuse regulatory criteria. Metal concentrations were generally below Indiana regulatory criteria, exceedences appeared in both up- and down-gradient wells suggesting background metal concentrations as opposed to significant leaching from WFS. The WFS did not result in a negative environmental impact on the site. 	State environmental regulatory agencies were the most frequently identified source of barriers to the beneficial reuse of WFS and reuse is further compounded by the lack of decision-based scientific tools such as life-cycle or risk-based analysis methods. The resultant liability exposure from state and federal regulations was the prevailing concern expressed by Departments of Transportation (DOTs) when considering using a regulated waste such as WFS. Furthermore, foundries often lack an organizational commitment to the reuse of its WFS as evidenced by the lack of both product quality control and a marketing strategy. 	To facilitate the use of WFS by INDOT, an <b>Acceptance</b> Criteria <b>protocol</b> based on the MicrotoxTM bioassay test was developed as part of this project. Additionally, a proposed “Recurring Special Provision” for the use of WFS in embankment construction and a WFS stockpile random sampling protocol were developed. The necessary decision tools for incorporating WFS into transportation construction, primarily embankment construction, appear to be available to the Indiana DOT and other DOTs) as products of this research...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Despite {{numerous}} {{advances in}} medicine, {{the mortality rate}} of severe sepsis and septic shock remains high, 30 - 50 %. New therapy strategies include: early goaldirected therapy, fluid replacement, early and appropriate antimicrobials, source of infection control, use of corticosteroids, vasopressors and inotropic therapy, use of recombinant activated protein C, tight glucose control, low-tidal-volume mechanical ventilation. They {{have been shown to}} improve the outcomes. The adequacy and speed of treatment influence the outcome, too. OBJECTIVE The objective was to evaluate if new therapy strategies had been integrated in our routine practice. METOD Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, who were treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) over a ten-month period, were analyzed retrospectively. The descriptive epidemiological method was applied. Central venous catheterization, central venous pressure, antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, corticosteroids, blood administration, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, glucose control, were evaluated. RESULTS 27 patients were analyzed. Patient characteristics were: age, 49. 9 years (18 - 77) with 30 -day in-hospital mortality rate of 48. 1 %. All patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Blood cultures were obtained in 85. 2 % patients. Adequate antimicrobial treatment was applied to 59. 3 % and 74. 1 % patients had central venous pressure monitoring. Average central venous pressure was 8. 47 ± 5. 6 mm Hg (- 2 - 20). Aggressive fluid therapy was given to 33. 3 % of the cases and 66. 7 % of the patients with septic shock received vasoactive drugs while 29. 6 % received corticosteroids. Red blood cell transfusions were applied in 59. 3 % of patients. All patients received stress ulcer prophylaxis, and 37 % of them deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. The average value of morning glucose was 9. 11 ± 5. 03 mmol/l (3. 7 - 22. 0). 63 % of patients were mechanically ventilated. Blood lactate was not determined. CONCLUSION Evidence-based clinical guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock have not been implemented in a widespread, systematic way in the ICU of the Clinical Centre, Kragujevac. Institutional <b>acceptance</b> of this <b>protocol,</b> and education of clinicians may improve survivability for patients with sepsis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Osteoarthritic knee (OA knee) is {{a common}} {{condition}} in the elderly. Exploration of non-invasive complementary therapies for OA knee is warranted given the limitations of pharmacologic therapies. Auriculotherapy (AT) is a therapeutic method in which specific points on the auricle are stimulated to treat various disorders of the body, and the therapeutic value and synergistic effect of laser auriculotherapy (LAT) when combined with magneto-auriculotherapy (MAT) merits further investigation. Methods: This study adopted a double-blinded four-arm randomized placebo design. The aims of study are (1) to assess the feasibility of AT among elders with OA knee in a future large-scale study, {{including the use of}} blinding in subjects and evaluators, <b>acceptance</b> of treatment <b>protocol,</b> and estimating the effect size and attrition rate; and (2) to evaluate the preliminary effect of AT in elders with OA knee. Subjects were randomly divided into four groups with different modes of AT with/without placebo objects. A total of 43 subjects completed the 6 -week intervention and post-assessment. Assessments included a numerical rating scale of pain (NRS), the timed-up-and-go test (TUGT), and standard goniometer measurements during knee flexion and extension, Kruskal-Wallis test was used to evaluate differences among groups, and Wilcoxon sign-ranked test for examining within-group comparison. Results: Preliminary results indicated the absence of differences in the NRS, TUGT, and active/passive knee flexion and extension at baseline, as well as post-therapy, between the four groups. Even though the differences of these parameters between groups were not significant, the relative differences of NRS and TUGT in subjects who received combined MAT plus LAT were higher than those treated with MAT or LAT alone, or the placebo group. Four of the six parameters demonstrated significant within group differences in subjects who received MAT and/or LAT, whereas {{no significant differences were found}} in the placebo group. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the AT protocol adopted in this study for elders with OA knee is feasible and could be applied in future larger-scale study. Larger sample size should be considered in a future trial to determine the causal relationship between treatment and effect. School of Nursin...|$|R
40|$|From 2018, AEB systems {{dedicated}} to avoid or mitigate passenger car-to-cyclist collisions {{will be considered}} in the safety assessment by Euro NCAP. To test such systems, appropriate equipment has been developed in the project CATS “Cyclist-AEB Testing System. ” Moreover, the project dealt with setting up a proposal for the most relevant test scenarios. The objective of the project was to provide proof of the relevance of the proposed test scenarios and of the feasibility of practical implementation of the scenarios and test setup to Euro NCAP. Accidentology was used to determine the most common car-to-cyclist accident scenarios in the EU. The test setup has been developed to deal with the three most relevant scenarios: two scenarios for a cyclist crossing the path of the car (from the near side and the far side), and a longitudinal scenario in which the car drives into the cyclist from the rear. Requirements regarding a soft cyclist target have been set up. These consider target visual and radar characteristics as typical AEB systems and the applied sensors should recognize the target as a real cyclist on a bike. Moreover, requirements to the design of the testing system and target result from practical testing constraints: during testing, possible collisions between car and target should be mild without compromising the testing. A target and target propulsion system were constructed to meet these requirements. Accident data and data from observation studies were used to determine the parameter ranges in the proposed test matrix for the selected test scenarios. Together with car manufacturers and suppliers, a test matrix has been proposed and a testing setup including cyclist target has been built. In several test series, the test setup and the protocol were verified. Verification considered not only the capability of the protocol to distinguish between well-performing and less-performing AEB systems, but also the reproducibility and repeatability of the tests. Also the practical use of the system and the target were tested. The CATS project was unique in the fact that developments were performed in a consortium of 10 car manufacturers and 7 automotive suppliers, with BASt as review partner. This has stimulated the harmonization and <b>acceptance</b> of the <b>protocol,</b> target and test setup. The progress and intermediate results including the used methodology have been shared on a regular basis during the project with stakeholders in Europe, Japan and the USA. Euro NCAP already indicated to consider the results of the CATS project as the main input to draft the test protocol, including scenarios and target for Cyclist-AEB systems in 2018...|$|R
