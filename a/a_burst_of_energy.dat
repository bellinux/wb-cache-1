5|$|The massive-star model {{probably}} {{does not explain}} all types of gamma-ray burst. There is strong evidence that some short-duration gamma-ray bursts occur in systems with no star formation and no massive stars, such as elliptical galaxies and galaxy halos. The favored theory for the origin of most short gamma-ray bursts is the merger of a binary system consisting of two neutron stars. According to this model, the two stars in a binary slowly spiral towards each other because gravitational radiation releases energy until tidal forces suddenly rip the neutron stars apart and they collapse into a single black hole. The infall of matter into the new black hole produces an accretion disk and releases <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> analogous to the collapsar model. Numerous other models have also been proposed to explain short gamma-ray bursts, including the merger of a neutron star and a black hole, the accretion-induced collapse of a neutron star, or the evaporation of primordial black holes.|$|E
500|$|In 343BC, Macedonian {{forces were}} {{conducting}} campaigns in Epirus and, in 342BC, Philip campaigned in Thrace. He also {{negotiated with the}} Athenians {{an amendment to the}} Peace of Philocrates.* D.M. MacDowell, Demosthenes the Orator, ch. 13. When the Macedonian army approached Chersonese (now known as the Gallipoli Peninsula), an Athenian general named Diopeithes ravaged the maritime district of Thrace, thereby inciting Philip's rage. Because of this turbulence, the Athenian Assembly convened. Demosthenes delivered On the Chersonese and convinced the Athenians not to recall Diopeithes. Also in 342BC, he delivered the Third Philippic, which is considered to be the best of his political orations. Using all the power of his eloquence, he demanded resolute action against Philip and called for <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> from the Athenian people. He told them that it would be [...] "better to die a thousand times than pay court to Philip".* D. M. MacDowell, Demosthenes the Orator, ch. 13. Demosthenes now dominated Athenian politics and was able to considerably weaken the pro-Macedonian faction of Aeschines.|$|E

2500|$|The {{official}} tone {{toward the}} Fifth Symphony was further set by a review by Alexei Tolstoy, who likened the symphony to the literary {{model of the}} Soviet Bildungsroman describing [...] "the formation of a personality"â€”in other words, of a Soviet personality. In the first movement, the composer-hero suffers a psychological crisis giving rise to <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> The second movement provides respite. In the third movement, the personality begins to form: [...] "Here the personality submerges itself in the great epoch that surrounds it, and begins to resonate with the epoch." [...] With the finale, Tolstoy wrote, came victory, [...] "an enormous optimistic lift." [...] As for the ecstatic reaction of the audience to the work, Tolstoy claimed it showed Shostakovich's perestroyka to be sincere. [...] "Our audience is organically incapable of accepting decadent, gloomy, pessimistic art. Our audience responds enthusiastically to all that is bright, clear, joyous, optimistic, life-affirming." ...|$|E

60|$|The moral {{influence}} of residence furnishes {{some of the}} most interesting traits of our national manners. The presence of this power was very apparent throughout the district that surrounded Beaumanoir. The ladies of that house were deeply sensible of the responsibility of their position; thoroughly comprehending their duties, they fulfilled them without affectation, with earnestness, and with that effect which springs from a knowledge of the subject. The consequences were visible in the tone of the peasantry being superior to that which we too often witness. The ancient feudal feeling that lingers in these sequestered haunts is an instrument which, when skilfully wielded, may be productive of vast social benefit. The Duke understood this well; and his family had imbibed all his views, and seconded them. Lady Everingham, once more in the scene of her past life, resumed the exercise of gentle offices, as if she had never ceased to be a daughter of the house, and as if another domain had not its claims upon her solicitude. Coningsby was often the companion of herself and her sister in their pilgrimages of charity and kindness. He admired the graceful energy, and thorough acquaintance with details, with which Lady Everingham superintended schools, organised societies of relief, and the discrimination which she brought to bear upon individual cases of suffering or misfortune. He was deeply interested as he watched the magic of her manner, as she melted the obdurate, inspired the slothful, consoled the afflicted, and animated with her smiles and ready phrase the energetic and the dutiful. Nor on these occasions was Lady Theresa seen under less favourable auspices. Without the vivacity of her sister, there was in her demeanour a sweet seriousness of purpose that was most winning; and sometimes <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> a trait of decision, which strikingly contrasted with the somewhat over-controlled character of her life in drawing-rooms.|$|E
