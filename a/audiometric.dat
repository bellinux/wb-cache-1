25|$|In Canada, {{health care}} is a {{responsibility}} of the provinces. In the province of Ontario, the price of hearing aids is partially reimbursed through the Assistive Devices Program of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, up to $500 for each hearing aid. Like eye appointments, audiological appointments are no longer covered through the provincial public health plan. <b>Audiometric</b> testing can still easily be obtained, often free of charge, in private sector hearing aid clinics and some ear, nose and throat doctors offices. Hearing aids may be covered to some extent by private insurance or in some cases through government programs such as Veterans Affairs Canada or Workplace Safety & Insurance Board.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} ways of {{evaluating}} how well a hearing aid compensates for hearing loss. [...] One approach is audiometry which measures a subject's hearing levels in laboratory conditions. [...] The threshold of audibility for various sounds and intensities is measured {{in a variety of}} conditions. [...] Although <b>audiometric</b> tests may attempt to mimic real-world conditions, the patient's own every day experiences may differ. [...] An alternative approach is self-report assessment, where the patient reports their experience with the hearing aid.|$|E
2500|$|Ototoxicity (hearing loss): {{there is}} at present no {{effective}} treatment to prevent this side effect, which may be severe. [...] <b>Audiometric</b> analysis {{may be necessary to}} assess the severity of ototoxicity. Other drugs (such as the aminoglycoside antibiotic class) may also cause ototoxicity, and the administration of this class of antibiotics in patients receiving cisplatin is generally avoided. [...] The ototoxicity of both the aminoglycosides and cisplatin may be related to their ability to bind to melanin in the stria vascularis of the inner ear or the generation of reactive oxygen species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Audiometric</b> {{testing is}} a very {{important}} part of a hearing conservation program. <b>Audiometric</b> testing allows for the identification of those that have lost significant hearing. Additionally, the testing allows for the identification of those who are in process of losing their hearing. <b>Audiometric</b> testing is most important in identifying those who have permanent hearing loss. This is called noise-induced permanent threshold shift (NIPTS).|$|E
50|$|The second {{aspect is}} the <b>audiometric</b> testing program. Employees exposed to levels {{at or above}} the EAV will undergo <b>audiometric</b> testing. The first test is called a baseline. It {{provides}} a standard to compare future <b>audiometric</b> tests to. If a significant change in hearing capabilities occurs (called a standard threshold shift) greater steps must be taken to ensure the employee is protected from high levels of noise exposure.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} found that {{distortion}} product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE’s) have provided the most information for detecting mild hearing loss in high frequencies when compared to transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE). This is an indication that DPOAE’s can help with detecting an early onset of noise-induced hearing loss. A study measuring <b>audiometric</b> thresholds and DPOAEs among individuals in the military showed that there was a decrease in DPOAEs after noise exposure, but did not show a shift in <b>audiometric</b> threshold. This supports OAEs as predicting early signs of noise damage.|$|E
50|$|The fourth {{aspect is}} a {{training}} program. The training program must cover {{the effects of}} noise on hearing, the purpose of hearing protection, {{and the purpose of}} <b>audiometric</b> testing.|$|E

5000|$|Audiometry (from audīre, [...] "to hear" [...] and metria, “to measure") is {{a branch}} of {{audiology}} and the science of measuring hearing acuity for variations in sound intensity and pitch and for tonal purity, involving thresholds and differing frequencies. Typically, <b>audiometric</b> tests determine a subject's hearing levels {{with the help of}} an audiometer, but may also measure ability to discriminate between different sound intensities, recognize pitch, or distinguish speech from background noise. Acoustic reflex and otoacoustic emissions may also be measured. Results of <b>audiometric</b> tests are used to diagnose hearing loss or diseases of the ear, and often make use of an audiogram.|$|E

50|$|Hearing {{level is}} the sound {{pressure}} level produced by an audiometer at a specific frequency. It is measured in decibels with reference to <b>audiometric</b> zero. Hearing of speech {{is considered to be}} impaired when the hearing level is shifted 25 dB or more.|$|E
50|$|Noise {{exposure}} measurement records {{must be maintained}} for at least 2 years. <b>Audiometric</b> test records must be retained {{for the duration of}} the affected employee's employment. Additionally, employees, former employees, representatives designated by the individual employee and the Assistant Secretary all must have access to these records.|$|E
50|$|An Audiometrist {{can choose}} to {{complete}} either a Certificate IV in <b>Audiometric</b> Assessment (available only {{as part of an}} apprenticeship) or a Diploma of Hearing Device Prescription and Evaluation. Only Audiometrists who complete the Diploma, and the further training below, are qualified to prescribe and fit hearing aids.|$|E
50|$|Nearly {{one in four}} adults had <b>audiometric</b> results {{suggesting}} noise-induced hearing loss. Almost one in four {{adults who}} reported excellent or good hearing had a similar pattern (5.5% {{on both sides and}} 18% on one side). Among people who reported exposure to loud noise at work, almost one third had such changes.|$|E
50|$|Evaluation (study of {{the patient}} with {{technical}} methods) shows the enlargement of the porus acousticus internus in the CT scan, enhancing tumours {{in the region of}} the cerebello-pontine angle in gadolinium-enhanced MRI scans, hearing loss in <b>audiometric</b> studies and perhaps pathological findings in electronystagmography.

50|$|Since {{the inner}} ear is not {{directly}} accessible to instruments, identification is by patient report and <b>audiometric</b> testing. Of those who present to their doctor with sensorineural hearing loss, 90% report having diminished hearing, 57% report having plugged feeling in ear, and 49% report having ringing in ear (tinnitus). About half report vestibular (vertigo) problems.|$|E
50|$|Tympanometry is a {{valuable}} component of the <b>audiometric</b> evaluation. In evaluating hearing loss, tympanometry permits a distinction between sensorineural and conductive hearing loss, when evaluation is not apparent via Weber and Rinne testing. Furthermore, in a primary care setting, tympanometry {{can be helpful in}} making the diagnosis of otitis media by demonstrating the presence of a middle ear effusion.|$|E
5000|$|Training: 29 CFR 1910.95(k) {{mandates}} {{an annual}} [...] "training program" [...] for [...] "all {{employees who are}} exposed to noise at or above an 8-hour time-weighted average of 85 decibels..."

50|$|Diagnosis of otodental {{syndrome}} {{was established}} using clinical, histopathological and <b>audiometric</b> methodologies. In normal individuals, {{by the age}} of 2-3, radiograph images should depict any signs of premolar development. A formal diagnosis of no premolar growth can be done by age 6 in order to check for signs of otodental syndrome. Sensorineural hearing loss can be another measure for proper diagnosis as well as checking for ocular coloboma. The latter is usually noticed at an around birth.|$|E

5000|$|An Audiometrist (from Latin , [...] "to hear"; {{and from}} Italian , “to measure” [...] ) or <b>Audiometric</b> Officer, is a health-care {{professional}} technician who has received special {{training in the}} use of Pure tone audiometry equipment. An audiometrist conducts hearing tests, or [...] "audiometric screening", with an Audiometer to establish hearing levels. The results are represented by an audiogram, and are usually interpreted by an audiologist, or a registered Medical Officer, unless the audiometrist is also an audiologist, with the aim of diagnosing hearing loss.|$|E
50|$|Dead regions affect <b>audiometric</b> results, {{but perhaps}} {{not in the way}} {{expected}}. For example, it may be expected that thresholds would not be obtained at the frequencies within the dead region, but would be obtained at frequencies adjacent to the dead region. Therefore, assuming normal hearing exists around the dead region, it would produce an audiogram that has a dramatically steep slope between the frequency where a threshold is obtained, and the frequency where a threshold cannot be obtained due to the dead region.|$|E
50|$|Audiometers are {{standard}} equipment at ENT (ear, nose, throat) clinics and in audiology centers. An alternative to hardware audiometers are software audiometers, {{which are available}} in many different configurations.Screening PC-based audiometers use a standard computer.Clinical PC-based audiometers are generally more expensive than software audiometers, but are much more accurate and efficient. They are most commonly used in hospitals, audiology centers and research communities. These audiometers are also used to conduct industrial <b>audiometric</b> testing. Some audiometers even provide a software developer's kit that provides researchers with the capability {{to create their own}} diagnostic tests.|$|E
50|$|The categorising of tympanometric data {{should not}} be used as a {{diagnostic}} indicator. It is merely a description of shape. There is no clear distinction between the three types, nor the two subtypes of type A, namely A and A. Only measures of static acoustic admittance, ear canal volume, and tympanometric width/gradient compared to sex, age, and race specific normative data can be used to somewhat accurately diagnose middle ear pathology along with the use of other <b>audiometric</b> data (e.g. air and bone conduction thresholds, otoscopic examination, normal word recognition at elevated presentation levels, etc.).|$|E
