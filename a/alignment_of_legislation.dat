40|$|With the {{expansion}} of organized crime in Central America, the countries in this continental sub-region have enacted {{a great deal of}} internal legislation, and have ratified international treaties at the universal, regional and Central American level, particularly after the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime took effect in 2000. This abundance of laws is very positive, and is an expression of these Central American States’ intent to fulfill their supranational obligations and provide security for their inhabitants. However, it is also negative in that it has led to dispersion, dislocation, discrepancies and inaccuracies regarding the prevailing legal regulations, because national laws have been developed with different concepts, structures, approaches, scope and definitions. Despite these conditions that are adverse to legal harmonization, Central America can move forward with matching its legislation against organized crime. Actually, there already exists an extensive common legal framework in this area, expressed in the fact that most international treaties on Organized Crime have come into force at the universal, regional and subregional levels, ratified by all or most countries Political will is the common denominator that should mediate all efforts of harmonization and <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation</b> in Central America; it is essential for proposing steps that are based on a common strategy or program.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine green {{building}} legislation requirements and practices in the construction project execution stage within the context of the South African construction industry. The rationale for this examination rests with the perception that the implementation of green practices (per se) has been recognised as being “behind” the legislation enacted to control the design and construction of green buildings. Design/methodology/approach: The research process consisted of a literature review to identify existing green building legislation and practices applicable to the project execution phase. This was supported by a sequential mixed-method research approach, which involved a survey of contracting companies based in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Purposive sampling was used to undertake focused interviews with management staff and site operatives. Findings: Research findings established a number of issues, not least: a gap between green building practices and legislation requirements; a high degree of unawareness of green building legislation/practices by construction company stakeholders; selective implementation of health and safety legislative requirements; that management staff had a more “positive” attitude to green building practices than site-based staff who tended to be less motivated and open to such practices. Research limitations/implications: Results from this study are considered generalisable with the sample frame only. Research inference and projections should therefore only be made within this set, and not to the wider population of South African contractors (as this study was limited to the Western Cape Province). Practical implications: Implications from this research are applicable to construction company stakeholders within the population set. Practical considerations include the need to acknowledge a formal commitment to developing a sustainable built environment – especially cognisant of the gap between practices on site and green building legislation requirements. Moreover, this lack of awareness in respect of green building practices and legislation requirements impinges upon several wider areas, not least: construction company stakeholders’ positioning, health and safety practices; managerial and operational staff perceptions, and stakeholders’ willingness and motivation to proactively address these gaps. Social implications: Government bodies and allied professionals in charge of construction industry development are encouraged to consider the implementation of green building legislation requirements on construction sites. This reflection should encourage engagement through formative legislative provision and transparent awareness campaigns. Originality/value: This work is original insofar as it directly addresses the <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>legislation</b> to current practices within the context of the South African construction industry. However, similar exercises have been undertaken on green building legislation in other countries such as USA, UK and Australia...|$|E
40|$|What impact {{does the}} European Union (EU) have on good {{governance}} Romania? The analysis shows that EU-driven governance reforms improve substantive legality (the <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>legislation</b> with international best standards), state capacity but weaken formal legality (the inner morality of law), {{many aspects of}} impartiality, efficiency-effectiveness and the coherence of state structures and policies. As a result, good governance is undermined. The persistence of bad governance is explained by three fundamental problems of Europeanization: 1. focus on quantity instead of quality, 2. partisan empowerment of change agents, 3. biased assessment of reform progress. The main argument is supported by an indicator-based analysis and qualitative interviews with representatives from the EU and Romania...|$|R
40|$|MBA thesisIt is a {{well-known}} fact that South Africa is rich with coal resources. Remaining coal reserves {{are estimated to be}} at least 69 billion metric tonnes. Both underground and opencast mining methods are used to extract the energy mineral in South Africa. South Africa uses its coal domestically as well as internationally for electricity generation and heating in the Iron and Steel industries. After the promulgation of South Africa‟s constitution, numerous mining related acts were passed in order to address social, economic and environmental factors in a sustainable way. The study sought to assess the positive and negative impacts <b>of</b> mining <b>legislation</b> in the design and development phase of opencast mining projects. An empirical, interpretivist and simple qualitative design approach was used. Data was collected from mining consultants, government authorities and mining companies through face to face semi-structured interviews. The study found that positive impacts <b>of</b> mining <b>legislation</b> on the budget, time and quality of opencast coal mining projects were: Standardised requirements to enter the mining sector, world class drafted legislation, timelines on authorisations, promotion of environmental consciousness and up-skilling of officials involved in authorisation processes. The negative impacts were: Lack <b>of</b> <b>alignment</b> on pieces <b>of</b> <b>legislation,</b> absence <b>of</b> timelines in some acts, turf war between the Department of Minerals Resources (DMR) and the Department of Environmental and Water Affairs (DWEA), long lead times to issue water use licences and environmental authorisations, insufficient clarity on Social Labour Plans and Political influence on authorisations. Recommendations on negative impacts are: Legislation harmonisation, proper and equal remuneration of staff involved in authorisation, site inspection by authorities, and clarity on SLP and stakeholder engagement...|$|R

Seventy-four adult women (mean age ± SD, 34. 9 ± 16. 4 years) were randomized to a Pilates-based mat class (n = 40) or a control group (n = 34). Pilates-based exercise participants were taught the Initial Mat of Body Control Pilates for 6 months, twice a week, for 60 minutes per session; the control group received no exercise intervention. Repeated measurements were performed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months <b>of</b> the frontal <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> the thoracolumbar spine, shoulder, and pelvis, and sagittal <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> the head and pelvis.

40|$|Regulating {{relations}} {{in the sphere of}} housing for their compliance with the Constitution, the legislator has, by the Rent Act, replaced tenant’s right of tenancy, under certain conditions, to lease. Since the <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> housing <b>legislation</b> implemented during the transition period of transformation of social property and privatization, the legislator, for the owners of apartments, had kept the burden of restrictions on their property rights, the burden of protected tenants, as (inevitable) effect to protect vested rights (based on valid legal grounds) on the apartment that is not their property. The enforcement of this legal regulation had not demanded that the owners of these apartments suffer greater restrictions on their ownership than the limitations that already existed, and which consisted in impossibility to live in that apartment. However, the Rent Act in Article 19 provides for situations in which the lessor (landlord) may cancel the lease to lessee (the former person entitled to tenancy rights). Nevertheless, except for reasons of Article 19 of Rent Act, landlord may terminate the lease if he intends to settle in the apartment wether alone or with his descendants, parents or persons under special regulations to support (Article 21 and 40 of the Rent Act). Regarding to their extreme sensitivity that emerged in implementing the law on real life (dis) advantages of addressees, Article 21 Paragraph 2 and Article 40 paragraphs 1 and 2 were before the Constitutional Court in the proceedings initiated in order to assess their conformity with the Constitution. Because of established breach of Articles 3, 14 § 2, 48 paragraph 1 and 50 paragraph 1 of the Constitution, Croatian Constitutional Court in decision and ruling UI- 762 / 1996 abolished Article 21 Paragraph 2 and Article 40 § of Rent Act. In pronouncement of mentioned decision is determined that abolished Article 21 Paragraph 2 and Article 40 Paragraph 2 of Rent Act expire until six months from the date of publication of this decision.

In particular, temporal <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> two or more subjects performing similar activities is a challenging problem due to the large temporal scale difference between human actions {{as well as the}} inter/intra subject variability. In this paper we present canonical time warping (CTW), an extension of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for spatio-temporal <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> the behavior between two subjects. CTW extends previous work on CCA in two ways: (i) it combines CCA with dynamic time warping for temporal alignment; and (ii) it extends CCA to allow local spatial deformations. We show CTW’s effectiveness in three experiments: <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> synthetic data, <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> motion capture data of two subjects performing similar actions, and <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> two people with similar facial expressions.
