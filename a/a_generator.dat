50|$|By {{increasing}} the number of pole faces surrounding the Gramme ring, the ring can be made to cut across more magnetic lines of force in one revolution than <b>a</b> basic two-pole <b>generator.</b> Consequently, <b>a</b> four-pole <b>generator</b> could output twice the voltage of <b>a</b> two-pole <b>generator,</b> <b>a</b> six-pole <b>generator</b> could output three times the voltage of a two-pole, and so forth. This allows output voltage to increase without also {{increasing the}} rotational rate.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} bimorph {{piezoelectric}} vibration energy harvester incorporating multiple PZT layers. The advantage of <b>a</b> multi-layer <b>generator</b> {{is that it}} produces a higher power than <b>a</b> single-layer <b>generator</b> having the same total thickness. In addition, a lower voltage is required to polarize <b>a</b> multi-layer <b>generator</b> {{reducing the risk of}} breakdown during polarization. Moreover, the optimum resistive load of <b>a</b> multi-layer <b>generator</b> is much lower than that of <b>a</b> single-layer <b>generator,</b> which makes it easier to couple to the electrical domain. In this work, it was found, experimentally, that <b>a</b> double-layer <b>generator</b> produces 41. 5 % and 19. 4 % more power than <b>a</b> singlelayer <b>generator</b> with the same total thickness of PZT and resonant frequency. This was verified theoretically. The generators have been fabricated by screen printing which is attractive for low cost mass production...|$|R
5|$|Python {{does not}} support tail call {{optimization}} or first-class continuations, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending Python's generators. Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5, {{it is possible to}} pass information back into <b>a</b> <b>generator</b> function, and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.|$|E

The ground floor was originally used for oil store, and it now houses the light equipment, including <b>a</b> <b>generator.</b> Access to the tower was originally through the ramped stone steps on the north, entering the first floor. This entrance was since sealed, and a steel door on the ground level is now used.|$|E

Hertz showed that the response of the second circuit was at a maximum when it was in tune with the first. The diagrams produced by Hertz in this paper were the first published plots of an electrical resonant response.|$|E

He maintained the Cutivereni (alternate spelling Cutivireni) mission of the Ene River parish in the Peruvian Amazon, southeast of Satipo. Cutivereni was a hub for 5,000 Asháninkas who lived in the area. The mission, located at the confluence of three rivers, had 91 buildings and housed 700 people. The mission was equipped with a plaza, a chapel, <b>a</b> <b>generator</b> building, an infirmary, a bilingual school, workshops, and a landing strip. The Asháninka hunted, and farmed manioc other foods. They also grew cocao, a cash-crop.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 {{there was}} another major fish kill, with over 200 dead fish found near the Fofanny water {{treatment}} works. There were approximately 150 trout and 55 salmon killed. The Northern Ireland Environment Agency investigated the incident and identified a potential source. It was revealed that an emergency discharge was carried out at Fofanny Water Treatment Work from 5am to 7am, due to <b>a</b> <b>generator</b> failure. The discharge was stopped as soon as personnel arrived at the site. Northern Ireland Water claimed the discharge was necessary to maintain the drinking water supply from Fofanny Dam.

5|$|Rubidium {{compounds}} {{are sometimes}} used in fireworks {{to give them}} a purple color. Rubidium has also been considered for use in a thermoelectric generator using the magnetohydrodynamic principle, where rubidium ions are formed by heat at high temperature and passed through a magnetic field. These conduct electricity and act like an armature of <b>a</b> <b>generator</b> thereby generating an electric current. Rubidium, particularly vaporized 87Rb, {{is one of the most}} commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling and Bose–Einstein condensation. Its desirable features for this application include the ready availability of inexpensive diode laser light at the relevant wavelength, and the moderate temperatures required to obtain substantial vapor pressures. For cold atom applications requiring tunable interactions, 85Rb is preferable due to its rich Feshbach spectrum.|$|E

5|$|The Una-class {{submarine}} (also {{known as}} Type 911) was {{a class of}} six midget submarines built for the Yugoslav Navy at the Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata (English: Special objects shipyard) during the 1980s. They were designed {{with the purpose of}} laying small minefields and transporting naval special forces, with or without their submersibles, in shallow waters that were inaccessible for larger submarines. Due to their mission profile that called for a small design as well as the need to stay undetected, they lacked torpedo armament and <b>a</b> <b>generator</b> for battery recharging.|$|E
5|$|The {{turbines}} {{were designed}} to operate at 12,500 rpm and were paired with <b>a</b> <b>generator</b> set with a 10:1 reduction gearing. A twin-armature DC generator was used to power the traction motors, while a three-phase, 220-volt AC generator provided auxiliary functions such as powering the traction motor blowers and providing head-end power; the latter, which was used to provide lighting, heating, and air conditioning to passenger cars, was incredibly unusual in 1939 and would not become standard until the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{victims were}} gassed with diesel exhaust {{from the engine}} of a Red Army tank. SS-Scharführer Erich Fuchs was {{responsible}} for installing it.

After about 20 minutes the bodies were removed by dozens of Sonderkommandos, placed onto carts and wheeled away. The system was imperfect and required a lot of effort; trains that arrived later in the day had to wait on layover tracks overnight at Treblinka, Małkinia, or Wólka Okrąglik.|$|E

5|$|Torque {{generated}} by the drive causes the induction motor to run at synchronous speed less the slip. If the load drives the motor faster than synchronous speed, the motor acts as <b>a</b> <b>generator,</b> converting mechanical power back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's DC link element (capacitor or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or braking DC chopper controls dissipation of this power as heat {{in a set of}} resistors. Cooling fans may be used to prevent resistor overheating.|$|E
5|$|British aero engines were {{normally}} {{equipped with}} a power take-off shaft {{that led to the}} rear of the engine. In twin engine aircraft like the Anson, one of these would be used for <b>a</b> <b>generator</b> that powered the aircraft instruments at 24V DC, the other would be left unconnected and available for use. Following a suggestion from Watt to avoid Air Ministry channels, in October Bowen flew one of the Battles to the Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick) plant in Sheffield, where he pulled the DC generator off the engine, dropped it on the table, and asked for an AC alternator of similar size and shape. Arnold Tustin, Metrovick's lead engineer, was called in to consider the problem, and after a few minutes he returned to say that he could supply an 80V unit at 1200 to 2400Hz and 800W, even better than the 500W requested. Bowen had an order for 18 pre-production units placed as soon as possible, and the first units started arriving at the end of October. A second order for 400 more quickly followed. Eventually about 133,800 of these alternators would be produced during the war.|$|E

Lutz's initial idea was to develop an all-electric car, but Jon Lauckner, General Motors Vice President for Global Vehicle Development, convinced him that to avoid an expensive battery, range anxiety concerns, and lack of public charging infrastructure, they could use a smaller battery pack with a small gasoline engine driving <b>a</b> <b>generator</b> acting as a backup to extend the range, but without a mechanical connection between the gasoline engine and the drive wheels, {{so it would be}} a pure electrically driven vehicle without many of the limitations General Motors learned from the EV1 experience.|$|E
