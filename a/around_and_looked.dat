60|$|The Prince turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> inquiringly at the surgeon.|$|E
60|$|They {{all three}} turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at the {{wonderful}} bank of pink roses {{within a few}} feet of them.|$|E
60|$|At {{this she}} turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at him. Even into her strong mind the sharp edge of {{distrust}} began to insert itself.|$|E
60|$|Dave was peering <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> anxiously at the heavy, leaden sky.|$|R
5000|$|... "Turn <b>Around</b> <b>and</b> <b>Look</b> at Me" [...] (Jerry Capehart, Glen Campbell) - 2:50 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{been for}} years. I'm {{one of those}} silent, patient fellows who hang <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> a lot but never tell their love...." ...|$|R
60|$|Dominey {{paused in}} the act of {{inserting}} a cartridge into his gun. He turned slowly <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> into his companion's expressionless face.|$|E
6000|$|... "They were {{every one}} dead or wounded, save Richard; {{and he was}} {{fighting}} single-handed with an Englishman, while the other six stood <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Shaggy Man," [...] called Dorothy, and {{ran after}} Toto. The little dog pranced briskly along for some distance; {{when he turned}} <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at his {{mistress}} questioningly.|$|E
50|$|When the bluebirds gather <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> ominously at Catfish Stu, Robear and Robert, {{the scene}} is {{reminiscent}} of the Alfred Hitchcock movie The Birds.|$|R
6000|$|... "Does it?" [...] said Rollo, turning <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> up to {{the part}} of the heavens where he had seen the star the evening before.|$|R
5000|$|... What type of {{structure}} (shape) does my work propose? It is organic, geometric? What if I turn the stain <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> {{at it from}} different angles? ...|$|R
60|$|The Frenchman ushered him in. The {{door was}} closed and {{carefully}} locked. Then Monsieur Guillot swung <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at his visitor with some curiosity. Granet was still wearing his uniform.|$|E
60|$|His nerves, however, were proof {{against my}} attack. He turned half <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> {{me in the}} face with great sad eyes, in which there was neither {{kindness}} nor resentment, nor any perceptible surprise.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Philippa's {{tone was}} melancholy. She did not recover her good spirits {{until we were}} out on the pretty, grassy, elm-shaded country road, garlanded with its ribbon of buttercups. Then she {{suddenly}} turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> me over scrutinizingly.|$|E
6000|$|... "The bird must go somewhere. You wouldn't have it hang <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> foolish. Then I've {{brought in}} {{something}} about the heedless hartebeest galloping over the deserted veldt." ...|$|R
6000|$|By-and-by {{he managed}} to screw his head <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> up, <b>and</b> there it was Ill-Luck that had him. [...] "I thought so," [...] said the Fiddler; and then he gave over kicking.|$|R
60|$|George {{had turned}} to reenter the cook room. He moved slowly <b>around</b> <b>and,</b> <b>looking</b> at his face, {{it seemed to me}} that he was turning over the wisdom and {{knowledge}} of centuries in his head.|$|R
60|$|Sophy, {{struck by}} {{something}} in his voice, swung <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at him. Then she thrust both her arms through his, clasped her two hands together, and led him firmly away. A glimmering of the truth was beginning to dawn upon her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Got here," [...] he said abruptly, {{and then}} swung <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at Grenfell. [...] "This {{is the other}} man? Well, he can stay and bring along the baggage. There's most a freight-car full. They'll give him a wagon and team at the hotel." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} the deer turned partly <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> {{squarely}} at the boys. They were evidently taken completely by surprise and their heads went up high as they discovered the enemy. Then, without further hesitation they leaped forward, toward the dense timber ahead.|$|E
5000|$|Historian George H. Kerr {{describes}} Shuri Castle as [...] "one of {{the most}} magnificent castle sites to be found anywhere in the world, for it commands the countryside below for miles <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> toward distant sea horizons on every side." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{thanked her}} for her {{information}} and bade her good-bye. She shook my hand very cordially and I walked away. I had gone but a very few steps when I wanted to turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> back, but I did not.|$|R
6000|$|... "Prove it yourself. Turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> at him. You've {{got him in}} profile. Look at his nose. That's Isaac Ford's. Yours is a thin {{edition of}} it. That's right. Look. The lines are fuller, but they are all there." ...|$|R
60|$|Ethelbertha {{said she}} would step down and light the fire herself, and told Amenda to follow her and watch how she did it. I felt {{interested}} in the experiment, and followed also. Ethelbertha tucked up her frock and set to work. Amenda and I stood <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> on.|$|E
60|$|As {{the leader}} sprang forward his gleaming eyes caught {{the play of}} the {{fountain}} and he rushed toward it and drank eagerly of the sparkling water. Many of the other Phanfasms drank, too, in order to clear their dry and dusty throats. Then they stood <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at one another with simple, wondering smiles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Get home, Franco!" [...] said Jonas again; and, stooping down, {{he took a}} {{piece of}} {{hardened}} snow or ice from the road, and threw it towards him. The ice fell, before it reached Franco, and rolled along towards his feet, which made him scamper along a little farther; and then he stopped, and turned <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at Jonas, as before.|$|E
5000|$|These changes {{denied a}} pilot {{the ability to}} twist <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> {{directly}} behind (known as [...] "Checking Six," [...] or looking at the [...] "Six O'clock" [...] position directly to the rear). Mirrors offered some help, but had a narrow field of view.|$|R
6000|$|... “Louise {{and baby}} both slept all through that awful night,” remarked Patsy, again yawning. “No wonder they’re up <b>and</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> bright <b>and</b> happy.” But {{she took her}} cousin’s hint and dressed so rapidly that she descended the stairs only a few moments after Beth did.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{beauty of}} McPherson’s writing is that peripheral, shimmery weirdness, the tug at your sleeve of {{something}} so otherworldly and luminous, you can’t bear to turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look.</b> What’s going on? A spellbinding and absolutely gorgeous new play {{by one of}} the true poets of the theater, that’s what." ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Jimmy stopped chuckling. Then {{he stopped}} ambling along the Crooked Little Path. He turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> back, {{and as he}} did so he {{scratched}} his head thoughtfully. He had just happened to think that Old Mr. Toad had gone up the Crooked Little Path, and it was up the Crooked Little Path that Mr. Blacksnake had shown himself that morning.|$|E
6000|$|Pat {{suddenly}} whirled Hal <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> keenly at {{his left}} ear. The rim {{was a dead}} white. [...] "If you can't believe the thermometer perhaps you can believe this," [...] said he drily as he touched the ear. [...] "What did I tell you about keeping your cap down over your ears? Shure, 'tis a tenderfoot and not a first class Scout at all, at all, thot ye be." ...|$|E
60|$|Jocelyn Thew turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> reflectively at the speaker. For {{a single}} moment Crawshay's muscles tingled with the {{apprehension}} of danger. There was a smouldering light in the other's eyes, such a light as might gleam in the tiger's eyes before his spring. Crawshay's hand slipped to his hip pocket. So for a moment they remained. Then Jocelyn Thew shrugged his shoulders, and the tense moment was past.|$|E
5000|$|Bassist Mark Hamilton {{has said}} of the video: 'Filmed in Cuba, and with a 'nice piece' of casting! This video shows Tim {{performing}} alone with an acoustic as we watch his (video) relationship split. The other Ash members spend the video driving <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> for him in barber shops and gas stations. Of course they find him and everything's OK, thank God!' ...|$|R
50|$|Humor is an {{on-going}} feature, a {{thing he}} focuses a lot on. One of his idols, Stephen King, once said his biggest wish was {{that someone would}} die of terror after reading his book. To that Jürgensen has remarked that his biggest wish is that someone will laugh so hard from reading his book {{that people in the}} bus will turn <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> at him.|$|R
50|$|The only {{vestiges of}} the old scheme that now remains are the huge St Bernard's Catholic Church (designed by Glasgow {{architect}} Thomas Cordiner and opened in December 1963) and the Sky Dragon take-away shop (est 1989), both on Wiltonburn Road. This Parish and family run business still survives despite the destruction of all <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> forward to growth {{with the advent of}} new housing.|$|R
