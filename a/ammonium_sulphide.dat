5000|$|In 1932, it was {{reported}} that dinitrogen gas was generated via an unknown mechanism during fermentation in the sediments of Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA. More than 40 years ago, Richards noticed that most of the ammonium that should be produced during the anaerobic remineralization of organic matter was unaccounted for. As there was no known biological pathway for this transformation, biological anaerobic oxidation of ammonium received little further attention. Thirty years ago, the existence of two chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms capable of oxidizing ammonium to dinitrogen gas was predicted on the basis of thermodynamic calculations. It was thought that anaerobic oxidation of ammonium would not be feasible, assuming that the predecessors had tried and failed to establish a biological basis for those reactions. By the 1990s, Arnold Mulder's observations were just consistent with Richard's suggestion. In their anoxic denitrifying pilot reactor, ammonium disappeared at the expense of nitrite with a clear nitrogen production. The reactor used the effluent from a methanogenic pilot reactor, which contained <b>ammonium,</b> <b>sulphide</b> and other compounds, and nitrate from a nitrifying plant as the influent. The process was named [...] "anammox," [...] and was realized to have great significance in the removal of unwanted ammonium. The discovery of the anammox process was first publicly presented at the 5th European congress on biotechnology. By the mid-1990s, the discovery of anammox in the fluidized bed reactor was published. A maximum ammonium removal rate of 0.4 kg N/m3/d was achieved. It was shown that for every mole of ammonium consumed, 0.6 mol of nitrate was required, resulting in the formation of 0.8 mol of N2 gas. In the same year, the biological nature of anammox was identified. Labeling experiments with 15NH4+ in combination with 14NO3− showed that 14-15N2 was the dominant product making up 98.2% of the total labeled N2. It was realized that, instead of nitrate, nitrite was assumed as the oxidizing agent of ammonium in anammox reaction. Based on a previous study, Strous et al. calculated the stoichiometry of anammox process by mass balancing, which is widely accepted by other groups. Later, anammox bacteria were identified as planctomycetes, and the first identified anammox organism was named Candidatus [...] "Brocadia anammoxidans." [...] Before 2002, anammox was assumed to be a minor player in the nitrogen cycle within natural ecosystems. In 2002 however, anammox was found to play an important part in the biological nitrogen cycle, accounting for 24-67% of the total N2 production in the continental shelf sediments that were studied. The discovery of anammox process modified the concept of biological nitrogen cycle, as depicted in Figure 2.|$|E

The profiles of the vertical flux and rate of production/consumption of these substances have revealed a number of intriguing features in the biogeochemical nature of the Black Sea. An approximate redox balance of the counter-fluxes of nitrate and ammonium into the sub-oxic zone has been revealed confirming that intensive denitrification may be the primary loss of nitrogen in the Black Sea. A low ratio of the nitrate stock to the flux of nitrate from the oxycline confirms the possibility of prominent changes {{in the distribution of}} nitrate on the time scale of a year. The ratio of the nitrate to oxygen vertical flux has revealed a lack of nitrate in the oxycline above the nitrate maximum. The lateral (related to the "Bosporus plume") flux of oxygen in the layer of the main pycnocline appears to be very important for the existing biogeochemical structure of the Black sea water column being the reason of sulphide consumption inside the anoxic zone and changes in the ammonium-sulphide stoichiometry of the anoxic zone, the primary reason of the existence of the sub-oxic layer and the basic reason of relative stability of the sulphide onset...|$|R

40|$|In today's move to "sustainable production" {{the leather}} industry, {{as well as}} many other {{industries}} is recognized as a polluting one. Traditional chemical operations are polluting because of the levels of inorganic chemical waste. Process chemicals which are not consumed within the reactions necessary to convert collagen to leather are currently discharged to waste. These are usually applied during bulk production, such as inorganic agents from beam house and tanning processes, e. g. lime, <b>sulphide,</b> <b>ammonium</b> salts, sulphuric acid and sodium chloride, mineral tanning agents – mainly Cr(III) and the less common Al(III), Zr(III), Ti(III), Fe(III) salts -, whereas depending on the tanning process and the leather article produced organic chemical waste discharged comprises aldehydic and polyphenolic tanning products, bating enzymes, organic carboxylic acids and excess electrolyte stable synthetic fat liquors.

These five different chemicals, singly or in combination, were used; {{at least one of}} which was highly successful in precipitating each of the metals, removing at least 99 % of that originally present. Copper and zinc were very effectively precipitated as the hydroxides with lime, whereas lead was not. Considering lead to be the most difficult metal to remove, four other chemical conditions were attempted for lead; these were ferrous sulphide alone, lime with ferrous sulphide, lime with carbon dioxide, and lime with ozone. The precipitation of lead with ferrous sulphide alone, was only partially successful with only 95 % removal. The other three combinations of chemicals precipitated more than 99 % of the soluble lead, giving excellent results. Furthermore, because lead is usually difficult to remove from solution, it is considered that the three new chemical combinations show strong promise for the removal of other heavy metals from wastewater solutions. Experiments were also conducted to decompose the organic compounds, formaldehyde and pyridine, in simulated wastewater solutions in a mixed reactor, using ozone and UV radiation as oxidants. Although 200 ppm Total Organic Carbon content of each of those chemicals, and a mixture of both, were completely decomposed by ozone-UV oxidation, the time taken for these decompositions ranged from about three to four hours.

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{suitability}} for use of different absorbers for desulphurisation, a technical-scale experimental plant was erected for operating conditions of 20 bar and a maximum of 730 C. The site for this plant is the Technical-Scale Test Hall of the RWE Company for Research and Development (RFE) {{on the site of}} DEA Mineraloel AG, UK Wesseling Works. RFE was entrusted with erecting the technical-scale plant and carrying out the experiments. The crude gases of an HTW gasifier with air or oxygen/steam operation are simulated by mixing desulphurized synthetic gas from oil pressure gasification with nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Setting different hydrogen sulphide, ammonia and water contents is done by dosing and joint evaporation of suitably concentrated <b>ammonium</b> hydrogen <b>sulphide</b> solutions. There is a heated mixing chamber and a superheater identical to the evaporator after the evaporator, where the gases can be heated to a maximum of 650 C. These flow into the reactor (inside diameter 60 mm, clear height 1360 mm) from the top, via a heated transfer pipe. To measure the temperature profile, there is a pipe with a total of 12 thermocouples in the reactor longitudinal axis. Below the absorbent heap, a heated analysis pipe opens into the reactor, through which a part flow of the gas flows to the analysers after pressure relieving. The main flow of the hot gas is cooled to 180 C in a sulphur cooler after the reactor and then reaches the water cooler via the sulphur separator and the pressure control valve. The separated condensate is locked out via the water separator, while the gases either flow directly to the torch or reach a gas washer. To regenerate the absorber, a gas containing oxygen (air/nitrogen or air/steam mixture) or steam is passed through the reactor along the same route.

The interfacial chemistry of the high-κ/III-V system is more complex than Si, due to the nature of the multitude of potential native oxide chemistries at the surface with the resultant interfacial layer showing poor electrical insulating properties when high-κ dielectrics are deposited directly on these oxides. It is necessary to ensure that a good quality interface is formed in order to reduce leakage and interface state defect density to maximise channel mobility and reduce variability and power dissipation. In this work, the ALD growth of aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3) and hafnium oxide (HfO 2) after various surface pre-treatments was carried out, with the aim of improving the high-κ/III-V interface by reducing the Dit – the density of interface defects caused by imperfections such as dangling bonds, dimers and other unsatisfied bonds at the interfaces of materials. A brief investigation was performed into the structural and electrical properties of Al 2 O 3 films deposited on In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As at 200 and 300 oC via a novel amidinate precursor. Samples were determined to experience a severe nucleation delay when deposited directly on native oxides, leading to diminished functionality as a gate insulator due to largely reduced growth per cycle. Aluminium oxide MOS capacitors were prepared by ALD and the electrical characteristics of GaAs, In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As and InP capacitors which had been exposed to pre-pulse treatments from triethyl gallium and trimethyl indium were examined, to determine if self-cleaning reactions similar to those of trimethyl aluminium occur for other alkyl precursors. An improved C-V characteristic was observed for GaAs devices indicating an improved interface possibly indicating an improvement of the surface upon pre-pulsing with TEG, conversely degraded electrical characteristics observed for In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As and InP MOS devices after pre-treatment with triethyl gallium and trimethyl indium respectively. The electrical characteristics of Al 2 O 3 /In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As MOS capacitors after in-situ H 2 /Ar plasma treatment or in-situ <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphide</b> passivation were investigated and estimates of interface Dit calculated. The use of plasma reduced the amount of interface defects as evidenced in the improved C-V characteristics. Samples treated with <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphide</b> in the ALD chamber were found to display no significant improvement of the high-κ/III-V interface. HfO 2 MOS capacitors were fabricated using two different precursors comparing the industry standard hafnium chloride process with deposition from amide precursors incorporating a ~ 1 nm interface control layer of aluminium oxide and the structural and electrical properties investigated. Capacitors furnished from the chloride process exhibited lower hysteresis and improved C-V characteristics as compared to that of hafnium dioxide grown from an amide precursor, an indication that no etching of the film takes place using the chloride precursor in conjunction with a 1 nm interlayer. Optimisation of the amide process was carried out and scaled samples electrically characterised in order to determine if reduced bilayer structures display improved electrical characteristics. Samples were determined to exhibit good electrical characteristics with a low midgap Dit indicative of an unpinned Fermi leve...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} surface {{cleaning}} procedures, passivation and interface formation following high-κ deposition on Ge(100) and InAs(100) substrates using soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPS). A comparison study between the thermal cleaning {{of the native}} oxide covered InAs(100) surface and atomic hydrogen cleaned surface indicated that thermal annealing to 450 oC {{is not sufficient to}} produce an oxide and carbon free surface whereas atomic hydrogen cleaning at 360 oC resulted in the removal of both native oxides and surface carbon contamination to produce a clean In rich surface. The selenium passivation of this atomically clean InAs showed evidence of arsenic replacement in the near surface region. Subsequent MgO deposition resulted in interface oxidation indicating that the selenium treatment has not been successful in passivating the InAs surface. In a similar study on the atomically clean Ge(100) surface, interface oxide formation was observed following MgO deposition while on the selenium passivated surface, no interface oxides were observed. Wet chemical sulphur treatments of both the Ge(100) and InAs(100) surfaces showed that the sulphur passivation layer was stable up to 500 oC and 600 oC, respectively. Subsequent studies involving the atomic layer deposition of ultra thin high-κ dielectric layers on these surfaces showed that thermal annealing was effective at reducing the interfacial oxides without altering the dielectric material’s stoichiometry. The high pressure post oxygen annealing treatment of Al 2 O 3 /Ge structures were chemically characterised using SXPS and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrically tested after fabricating MOS capacitor structures. The density of interface states (Dit) was significantly decreased when the Ge(100) surface was subjected to wet chemical based sulphur treatments prior to dielectric deposition. Finally, the concentrations of germanium sulphide formation on the Ge(100) surface achieved by diluting <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphide</b> in various alcohols was studied using SXPS and the electrical impact on the CV measurements of MOS structures on these surfaces was investigated. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{work within}} this thesis is {{directed}} towards optimising and expanding {{the application of}} electrodeposition-coupled-electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ED-ETAAS). The technique involves modifying {{the surface of the}} graphite furnace by in-situ electrodeposition of a noble metal. The analyte is electrodeposited onto the modifier and the spent sample matrix is aspirated from the furnace, thus separating the analyte from sample matrix components which can interfere with ETAAS analysis. The electrodeposited analyte is then determined by ETAAS. Parameters for electrodeposition of modifier and analytes were optimised. It was shown that ED-ETAAS could be used to determine lead, cadmium, and copper in 0. 5 M NaCl media with sensitivity and detection limits similar to conventional ETAAS. The technique was used to determine copper and cadmium in seawater. Different noble metal modifiers were compared. Palladium was shown to provide better sensitivity and thermal stabilisation than iridium or rhodium for lead determination. ED-ETAAS. was used for the determination of inorganic mercury. The detection limit for the technique, using a 20 µL sample volume, was ca. 18 ppb (corresponding to ca. 380 pg), with a characteristic mass of 91 pg. The electrodeposited palladium modifier provided greater analyte stabilisation and sensitivity than gold or <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphide</b> modifiers. The technique was compared with cold vapour-ETAAS, for which a detection limit of ca. 1. 7 ppb was determined using an 8. 4 mL sample volume. The electrodeposited palladium modifier was shown to provide superior sensitivity to palladium chloride modifier. ED-ETAAS was examined as a technique for differentiating between free metal ions and those bound in inert and/or stable complexes. This involved selective deposition for fractionation of Bi 3 +, Pb 2 +, Ni 2 + and Cu 2 + in the presence of varying concentrations of EDTA. Fractionation of bismuth was possible (Bi-EDTA- is inert) but in labile systems the quantitative deposition process disturbed the solution equilibria resulting in an overestimation of the free metal concentration. In an attempted application to natural waters, problems were encountered with adsorption of fulvic acid on the furnace surface. Thus EDETAAS is not recommended as a method for fractionating metal-ligand species in natural systems. The ED-ETAAS technique was successfully used for fractionation of arsenic species. The detection limit for arsenite determination from nitric acid media was 0. 58 ppb (corresponding to 22 pg in a 39 µL sample), with a characteristic mass (peak absorbance) of 7. 5 pg. Total arsenic was determined from media containing L-cysteine, with a detection limit of 1. 3 ppb (51 pg) and a characteristic mass of 6. 6 pg. The technique was used to determine AsIII and total arsenic in two natural waters. The ED-ETAAS technique gave the same results as two comparative techniques (ETAAS and hydride generation ETAAS) provided that peak absorbance measurements were used...|$|E
40|$|This work {{looks at}} the effect on mid-gap {{interface}} state defect density estimates for In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As semiconductor capacitors when different AC voltage amplitudes are selected for a fixed voltage bias step size (100 [*]mV) during room temperature only electrical characterization. Results are presented for Au/Ni/Al 2 O 3 /In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As/InP metal–oxide–semiconductor capacitors with (1) n-type and p-type semiconductors, (2) different Al 2 O 3 thicknesses, (3) different In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As surface passivation concentrations of <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphide,</b> and (4) different transfer times to the atomic layer deposition chamber after passivation treatment on the semiconductor surface—thereby demonstrating a cross-section of device characteristics. The authors set out to determine {{the importance of the}} AC voltage amplitude selection on the interface state defect density extractions and whether this selection has a combined effect with the oxide capacitance. These capacitors are prototypical of the type of gate oxide material stacks that could form equivalent metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors beyond the 32 [*]nm technology node. The authors do not attempt to achieve the best scaled equivalent oxide thickness in this work, as our focus is on accurately extracting device properties that will allow the investigation and reduction of interface state defect densities at the high-k/III–V semiconductor interface. The operating voltage for future devices will be reduced, potentially leading to an associated reduction in the AC voltage amplitude, which will force a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio of electrical responses and could therefore result in less accurate impedance measurements. A concern thus arises regarding the accuracy of the electrical property extractions using such impedance measurements for future devices, particularly in relation to the mid-gap interface state defect density estimated from the conductance method and from the combined high–low frequency capacitance–voltage method. The authors apply a fixed voltage step of 100 [*]mV for all voltage sweep measurements at each AC frequency. Each of these measurements is repeated 15 times for the equidistant AC voltage amplitudes between 10 mV and 150 mV. This provides the desired AC voltage amplitude to step size ratios from 1 : 10 to 3 : 2. Our results indicate that, although the selection of the oxide capacitance is important both to the success and accuracy of the extraction method, the mid-gap interface state defect density extractions are not overly sensitive to the AC voltage amplitude employed regardless of what oxide capacitance is used in the extractions, particularly in the range from 50 % below the voltage sweep step size to 50 % above it. Therefore, the use of larger AC voltage amplitudes in this range to achieve a better signal-to-noise ratio during impedance measurements for future low operating voltage devices will not distort the extracted interface state defect density...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{entitled}} ‘Studies on the Chemistry of Carbonates and Carbamates’ comprises {{of seven}} chapters. Chapter 1 The reactivity of propargyloxycarbonyl (Poc) derivatives of amines and alcohols with various sulphur nucleophiles is {{addressed in this}} chapter. The chapter {{is divided into three}} different parts. Part 1 : The difference in reactivity of propargyloxycarbonyl (Poc) derivatives of amines and alcohols with benzyltriethylammonium tetrathiomolybdate [(PhCH 2 NEt 3) 2 MoS 4, 1] is studied in detail and the results are discussed. It has been shown that amino alcohols can be protected as their diPoc derivatives using 2 equiv of propargyloxycarbonyl chloride (2). The selective deprotection of the O-Poc group using 1 equiv of 1 without affecting the N-Poc group is achieved (Scheme 1). Scheme 1 Part 2 : The reactivity of propargyloxycarbonyl derivatives of various alcohols, phenols and primary and secondary amines with benzyltriethylammonium tetrathiomolybdate (1) is compared with the reactivity of these Poc derivatives with other sulphur nucleophiles such as sodium thiophenoxide, lithium sulphide, hydrogen sulphide and <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphide.</b> The study reveals that tetrathiomolybdate (1) is the best sulphur nucleophile for the deprotection of Poc group. Poc derivatives of primary amines cyclized to the corresponding 4 -methylene- 2 -oxazolidinones when treated with other sulphur nucleophiles (Scheme 2). Scheme 2 Part 3 : The reaction between different propargyloxycarbonyl derivatives of alcohols and benzyltriethylammonium tetrathiomolybdate (1) is studied. It is found that propargyloxycarbonyl derivatives can be made more reactive towards tetrathiomolybdate by substituting the propargyl system with electron withdrawing substituents. Chapter 2 The application of propargyloxycarbonyl group {{for the protection of the}} side chain hydroxyl groups of serine, threonine and tyrosine is discussed. The O-Poc derivatives are shown to be stable to a variety of acidic and basic conditions and the applications of these derivatives in solution phase peptide synthesis is addressed. The easy and effective deprotection of the O-Poc group provides a new strategy for the synthesis of peptides bearing the hydroxy amino acid residues: serine, threonine and tyrosine. Scheme 3 Chapter 3 Development of a novel C 2 -symmetric protecting group for amines and amino acids is described in this chapter. But- 2 -ynyl- 1, 4 -bisoxycarbonyl chloride (BbcCl, 3) is synthesized from 1, 4 -dihydroxybut- 2 -yne and used as a reagent for protecting amines as biscarbamates (Scheme 4). These biscarbamates (Bbc derivatives) are deblocked using benzyltriethylammonium tetrathiomolybdate (1) to get the amines back. Scheme 4 The orthogonal stability of the Bbc group with Boc, Cbz and Fmoc groups is established. It is also shown that Bbc group can be deblocked to the corresponding amines using resin-bound tetrathiomolybdate. The application of Bbc protected amino acids in solution phase peptide synthesis is demonstrated (Scheme 5). Scheme 5 Chapter 4 The simultaneous protection and activation of amino acids using various pentafluorophenyl carbonates is described in two parts. Part 1 : A very efficient and high yielding method for the simultaneous protection of the amino group and activation of carboxylic acid group using propargyl pentafluorophenyl carbonate (PocOPfp, 4) is discussed. Treating amino acids with 2 equiv of 4 protects the amino group as a propargyl carbamate and activates the carboxylic acid group as a pentafluorophenyl ester (Scheme 6). Scheme 6 Part 2 : The generality of the methodology developed for the simultaneous protection and activation of amino acids using PocOPfp (4) is studied with five different pentafluorophenyl carbonates viz. AlocOPfp, CbzOPfp, BocOPfp, EocOPfp and TrocOPfp. The studies reveal that the effectiveness of the methodology depends on the nature of the pentafluorophenyl carbonates and on the nature of the amino acids. Sterically bulky pentafluorophenyl carbonates such as BocOPfp reacted slowly with amino acids while electron deficient pentafluorophenyl carbonates such as TrocOPfp reacted faster and gave the N-protected active esters in very good yields. Amino acids bearing longer aliphatic side chains reacted better than the other amino acids. Chapter 5 The chapter describes results of the detailed studies on the base catalyzed cyclization of N-alkyl and N-aryl-O-propargyl carbamates to the corresponding 4 -alkylidene- 2 -oxazolidinones. The effect of various bases and solvents on these cyclization reactions is studied systematically to design the most suitable conditions. The best results were obtained using catalytic amount of LiOH in DMF. The cyclization reactions of N-aryl-O-propargyl carbamates were faster than the cyclization of N-alkyl-O-propargyl carbamates. The effect of substitutions on the propargyl group in these reactions is studied by preparing various substituted propargyl carbamate derivatives from the corresponding amines and propargyl chloroformates (Scheme 7). Scheme 7 Chapter 6 An efficient procedure for the synthesis of dehydroalanine and dehydroamino butyric acid derivatives from the preformed carbonate derivatives of serine and threonine respectively, by treating with K 2 CO 3 in DMF is discussed in this chapter. The reaction proceeds stereoselectively through a trans E 2 -elimination pathway to give only the Z-isomer of dehydroamino butyric acid derivatives from the carbonate derivatives of threonine. The methodology offers an easy access to dehydropeptides and proceeds without racemization of other stereogenic centers present in the peptide (Scheme 8). Scheme 8 Chapter 7 This chapter describes the use of propargyloxycarbonyl derivatives of lysine as an efficient tool for the synthesis of peptide conjugates using a click chemistry approach. The Cu(I) catalyzed cycloaddition reaction between azides and alkynes is employed in the synthesis of conjugates of lysine. Peptides bearing an Nε-Poc Lysine residue can be synthesized using traditional strategies and these peptides can be easily conjugated with azide derivatives of sugars and amino acids (Scheme 9). Scheme 9 The efficiency of the method is demonstrated by carrying out more than one click reaction in one pot using di and tri-propargyl derivatives of lysine. A dendritic core (6) is prepared from a tri-propargyl derivative (5) of lysine and an azide derived from leucine (Scheme 10).

Less common abbreviations are defined, the first time they are mentioned in the thesis...|$|E
