5|$|The {{next day}} the Grays returned, and Ann became {{suspicious}} when Burke would not let her approach a bed where she had left her stockings. When they were left <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> in the early evening, the Grays searched the straw and found Docherty's body, showing blood and saliva on the face. On their way to alert the police, they ran into McDougal who tried to bribe them with an offer of £10 a week; they refused. While the Grays reported the murder to the police, Burke and Hare removed the body {{and took it to}} Knox's surgery. The police search located Docherty's bloodstained clothing hidden under the bed. Burke and his wife gave different times for Docherty's departure from the house, which raised enough suspicion for the police to take them in for questioning. Early the following morning the police went to Knox's dissecting-rooms where they found Docherty's body; James Gray identified her as the woman he had seen with Burke and Hare. Hare and his wife were arrested that day, as was Broggan; all denied any knowledge of the events.|$|E
25|$|The {{last day}} Valtorta {{was able to}} leave her house on her own, despite her high level of fatigue, was 4 January 1933. From 1 April 1934 {{she was no longer}} able to leave her bed. In 1935, a year after she was bed-ridden, Martha Diciotti began to care for her. Valtorta's father died in 1935 and her mother in 1943, after which she was mostly <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> with Martha Diciotti taking care of her to the end of her life. Except for a brief wartime {{evacuation}} to Sant’ Andrea di Compito in Lucca, from April to December 1944, during the Second World War, {{the rest of her life}} was spent in her bed at 257 Via Antonio Fratti in Viareggio.|$|E
500|$|Lucan {{may have}} called at the Chester Square home of Madelaine Florman (mother {{of one of}} Frances's school friends) {{sometime}} between 10:00pm and 10:30pm. <b>Alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> Florman ignored the door, but shortly afterwards she received an incoherent telephone call and put the receiver down. Blood stains, which after forensic examination {{were found to be}} a mixture of blood groups A and B, were later discovered on her doorstep. Lucan certainly called his mother between 10:30pm and 11:00pm and asked her to collect the children from Lower Belgrave Street. According to the Dowager Countess, he spoke of a [...] "terrible catastrophe" [...] at his wife's home. He told her that he had been driving past the house when he saw Veronica fighting with a man, in the basement. He had entered the property and found his wife screaming. The location from which he made this, and possibly the call to Florman, remains unknown. The police forced their way into Lady Lucan's home and discovered Sandra Rivett's body before his wife was taken by ambulance to St George's Hospital. Lucan drove the Ford Corsair [...] to Uckfield, in East Sussex, to visit his friends, the Maxwell-Scotts. Susan Maxwell-Scott's meeting with Lucan was his last confirmed sighting.|$|E

500|$|Joy Division {{were due}} to begin their first American tour in May 1980. While Curtis had {{expressed}} a desire to take time off to visit a few acquaintances, he feigned excitement about the tour around the band because {{he did not want to}} disappoint either his bandmates or Factory Records. At the time, Curtis's relationship with his wife, Deborah (the couple had married in 1975 as teenagers), was strained. Contributing factors were his ill health, his excluding her from band activities, and his affair with a young Belgian woman named Annik Honoré whom he had met on a 1979 European tour. The evening before Joy Division were to fly out for their first American tour, Curtis returned to his home in Macclesfield to talk to his by then estranged wife. He asked her to drop the divorce suit she had filed; later, he told her to leave him <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> until he caught a train to Manchester the following morning. Early on 18 May 1980, having spent the night watching the Werner Herzog film Stroszek, Curtis hanged himself in his kitchen. Deborah discovered his body later that day when she returned to their home. It came as a shock both to the band members and their management. In 2005, Wilson recollected: [...] "I think all of us made the mistake of not thinking his suicide was going to happen We all completely underestimated the danger. We didn't take it seriously. That's how stupid we were".|$|E

When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: [...] "She {{had a sort of}} cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and {{covering}} her nose. She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help but I told her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could have told me there and then. The door would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room." ...|$|E

In December 1902, Peter himself met with a [...] "tragic accident." [...] According to Belle, he was reaching for his slippers next to the kitchen stove when he was scalded with brine. [...] She later declared that part of a sausage-grinding machine fell on to him from a high shelf, causing a fatal head injury. A year later, Peter's brother, Gust, took Peter's older daughter, Swanhild, to Wisconsin. [...] She is the only child to have survived living with Belle.|$|E

2500|$|Kathleen Mary [...] "Kathy" [...] Griffin {{was born}} on November 4, 1960, in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, to Mary Margaret [...] "Maggie" [...] Griffin (née Corbally; born June 10, 1920) and John Patrick Griffin (October 29, 1915 – February 17, 2007), both first-generation Irish Americans. Maggie worked as a cashier for Oak Park Hospital. Griffin has four older siblings: Kenny, Joyce, Gary, and John. Griffin {{described}} herself during her early years as [...] "a kid who needed to talk, all the time." [...] She would often visit her neighbors, the Bowens, to tell them stories about her family; she has referred to those visits as her first live shows and {{the place where she}} learned [...] "the power of juicy material." [...] After most of her siblings had moved, Griffin often spent hours <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and developed a binge eating disorder. She explained that even though eating disorders were not very well known at that time, she knew her eating behavior was aberrant and always threw the garbage away in the neighbor's can. In her 2009 autobiography Official Book Club Selection, Griffin confessed that she [...] "still suffers [...] " [...] but has learned to [...] "deal with them." [...] In the same book, Griffin discussed her eldest brother, Kenny, who was a drug addict and homeless at various times, and revealed that she was [...] "afraid of him until the moment he died" [...] due to his violent, abusive nature. Griffin states that Kenny would climb into bed with her when he was 30 and she was 7 and [...] "whisper" [...] into her ears; Kathy refused to speak to him or {{be in the same room}} as him for years but didn't tell her parents until she was in her twenties, at which point he openly admitted pedophilia to their parents.|$|E
2500|$|The {{novel is}} divided into two parts, {{entitled}} [...] "One" [...] and [...] "Two", both of which are narrated by Tony Webster when he is retired and living alone. The first part begins in the 1960s with four intellectually arrogant school friends, of whom two feature in the remainder of the story: Tony, the narrator, and Adrian, the most precociously intelligent of the four. [...] Towards the end of their school days another boy at the school hangs himself, apparently after getting a girl pregnant. [...] The four friends discuss the philosophical difficulty of knowing exactly what happened. [...] Adrian goes to Cambridge University and Tony to Bristol University. Tony acquires a girlfriend, Veronica, at whose family home he spends an awkward weekend. On waking one morning he finds that he and Veronica's mother, Sarah, are <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> and she apologises for her family's behaviour towards him. Tony and Veronica's relationship fails in some acrimony, as he breaks up with her after she has sex with him. In his final year at university Tony receives a letter from Adrian informing him that he is going out with Veronica. Tony replies to the letter, telling Adrian that in his opinion Veronica was damaged in some way and that he should talk to her mother about it. Some months later he is told that Adrian has committed suicide, leaving a note addressed to the coroner saying that the free person has a philosophical duty to examine the nature of their life, and may then choose to renounce it. Tony admires the reasoning. He briefly recounts the following uneventful forty years of his life until his sixties. At this point Tony's narration of {{the second part of the}} novel – which is twice as long as the first – begins, with the arrival of a lawyer's letter informing him that Veronica's mother has bequeathed him £500 and two documents. These lead him to re-establish contact with Veronica and after a number of meetings with her, to re-evaluate the story he has narrated in the first part. On consulting the lawyers, Tony learns that Veronica has Adrian's diary. This leads him to send Veronica repeated e-mails requesting the diary. Veronica eventually sends Tony a single page of the diary, containing Adrian's musings on life as a series of cumulative wagers. Following this, Veronica meets Tony on the Millennium Bridge in London and gives him the letter he sent to Adrian in his youth. On re-reading it, Tony realises how malicious and unpleasant it was, and how he has erased this from his memory. Nevertheless, he persists in attempting to retrieve the diary from Veronica, which leads to her asking him to meet at a location in North London, where she drives him to see a group of mentally retarded men being taken for a walk by their careworker, one of whom she points out to him. Tony does not understand the significance of this and Veronica leaves him with no explanation. Over the course of several weeks, Tony revisits the location until he is able to relocate the man Veronica showed him in a pub. Tony greets the man saying he is a friend of Veronica's which leads to an upset response from the man. Tony realises from the man's features that this is Adrian's son, and he e-mails Veronica an apology, saying he didn't realise that she and Adrian had a son together. Veronica only responds with the reply [...] "You don't get it, but then you never did." [...] On revisiting the pub where he saw the man, Tony gets into conversation with the careworker, which reveals that the man is actually the son of Adrian and Veronica's mother, Sarah, making him Veronica's half-brother. Tony realises that his letter to Adrian, telling him to talk to Sarah, was the cause of the affair they had together, that Sarah's son was born with mental issues because of her advanced age and that Adrian killed himself because he could not face the responsibility.|$|E
