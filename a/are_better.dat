The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive.

For example, some have patterns in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, much like the spider webs described above.|$|E

5|$|Antibody mimetics are organic {{compounds}} that, like antibodies, can specifically bind antigens. They are usually artificial peptides or proteins with a molar mass of about 3 to 20 kDa. Nucleic acids and small molecules are sometimes considered antibody mimetics, but not artificial antibodies, antibody fragments and fusion proteins are composed from these. Common advantages over antibodies <b>are</b> <b>better</b> solubility, tissue penetration, stability towards heat and enzymes, and comparatively low production costs. Antibody mimetics {{such as the}} Affimer and the DARPin have being developed and commercialised as research, diagnostic and therapeutic agents.|$|E

Joint attention is also important for social learning. Gaze following reflects an expectation-based type of orienting in which an individual's attention is cued by another's head turn or eye turn.

The ability to conceptualize beyond the mere reduction of stone cores demonstrates cognitive flexibility, and the use of glue, which was often processed with ochre, to attach flakes to hafts demonstrates an understanding of chemical changes that can be utilized beyond the simple use of color. Adhesives were used to construct hafted tools by 70ka at Sibudu Cave in South Africa.|$|E
