60|$|I {{know it will}} be said--I {{will not}} weary the House by arguing it, but I only desire to meet at once the {{objection}} that will be taken--that these councils will, if you take away the safeguard of the official majority, pass any number of wild-cat Bills. The <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{that the head of}} the Government can veto the wild-cat Bills. The Governor-General can withhold his assent, and the withholding of the assent of the Governor-General is no defunct power. Only the other day, since I have been at the India Office, the Governor-General disallowed a Bill passed by a Local Government which I need not name, with the most advantageous effect. I am quite convinced that if that Local Government had had an unofficial majority the Bill would never have been passed, and the Governor-General would not have had to refuse his assent. But so he did, and so he would if these gentlemen, whose numbers we propose to increase and whose powers we propose to widen, chose to pass wild-cat Bills. And it must be remembered that the range of subjects within the sphere of Provincial Legislative Councils is rigorously limited by statutory exclusions. I will not labour the point now. Anybody who cares, in a short compass, can grasp the argument, of which we shall hear a great deal, in Paragraphs 17 to 20 of my reply to the Government of India, in the Papers that will speedily be in your Lordships' hands.|$|E

40|$|For several reasons, {{databases}} may be {{inconsistent with}} respect to a set of integrity constraints. Those inconsistent states must be somehow resolved {{in order to be able}} to use the information stored in them. In some cases, data cleaning could be an approach to get rid of these inconsistencies. However, this may be a complex and nondeterministic process <b>that</b> may lead <b>to</b> the loss of potentially useful information. To avoid this, we present in this paper an alternative approach, which consists in computing only those <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> queries <b>that</b> <b>are</b> consistent with the integrity constraints by means of an algorithm called QUECA. Given a first order query Q, the algorithm generates a new query QUECA(Q), such <b>that,</b> when posed <b>to</b> a database, its <b>answers</b> correspond <b>to</b> the <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> Q <b>that</b> <b>are</b> consistent with the given integrity constraints. We prove QUECA to be sound, terminating and complete for a class of integrity constraints that includes most of the constraints found in traditional relational database systems. Complexity issues are also addressed. Finally, we describe the implementation of the algorithm in XSB. We take advantage of the functionalities of XSB, as a deductive database with tabling capabilities, and the possibility of coupling it to a relational database systems. ...|$|R
