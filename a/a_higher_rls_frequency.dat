In this paper we show that the wavelet theory recently developed by the mathematician Y. Meyer enables us to understand and model the concepts of resolution and scale. In computer vision we generally {{do not want to}} analyze the images at each resolution level because the information is redundant. After processing the signal at a resolution r 0, it is more efficient to analyze only the additional details which are available at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> resolution <b>rl.</b> We prove that this difference of information can be computed by decomposing the signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis and that it can be efficiently calculated with a pyramid transform. This can also be interpreted as a division of the signal in a set of orientation selective frequency channels. Such a decomposition is particularly well adapted for computer vision applications such as signal coding, texture discrimination, edge detection, matching algorithms and fractal analysis...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, a hybrid {{technique}} involving {{artificial neural network}} (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA) has been proposed for performing modeling and optimization of complex biological systems. In this approach, first an ANN approximates (models) the non-linear relationship(s) existing between its input and output example data sets.

The efficacy of this formalism has been tested by conducting a case study involving optimization of DNA curvature characterized in terms of the RL value.

30|$|Recently, SSF {{has built}} up {{reliability}} in many industries and has evolved as an interesting substitute to SLF (Singhania et al. 2009). Severe foaming problems usually result from the production of biosurfactants in SLF and therefore, researches have suggested their production in SSF. Of these biosurfactants, RLs {{have been the most}} attractive for their production in SSF in recent years. The present work aimed at the optimization of the fermentation conditions for RL production in SSF. Twelve different solid substrates or combinations of solid substrates were screened for the production of RLs by the hyperproducing mutant 15 GR using GMSM as the impregnating solution. Selection of an appropriate substrate is an important feature of SSF since it acts as both a source of nutrients and a physical support (Pandey 2003). As shown in the results, the <b>highest</b> <b>RL</b> level was obtained with the mixture of sugarcane bagasse and sunflower seed meal. Sugarcane bagasse, a porous residue obtained from cane stalks after the juice extraction from sugarcane (Soccol et al. 2010) consists chiefly of cellulose and hemicelluloses, lignin, nitrogenous compounds, and ash (Abdullah et al. 2006). Sunflower seed meal is obtained by grinding sunflower seeds which are rich in lipids, carbohydrates and proteins (Alberton et al. 2010). The <b>high</b> <b>RL</b> levels obtained using this mixture {{may be due to the}} fact that oils usually stimulate RL production, as reported in previous SLF studies (Benincasa and Accorsini 2008; Costa et al. 2006; Trummler et al. 2003). Another explanation may be that the mixture of substrates resulted in a substrate bed with properties superior to single substrates. Using sunflower seed meal alone caused the solid substrate to compact considerably probably due to its high lipid content. Sugarcane bagasse acts as a bulking agent, improving the substrate bed properties (Alberton et al. 2010).|$|R

Tomato plants were subjected to NB treatments with different frequencies ranging from every 1, 2, 3, and 4 h, and plant growth, flowering, and yield were monitored. The results showed that {{with the increase of}} <b>RL</b> NB <b>frequency,</b> plant height decreased, stem diameter increased, and flower initiation delayed, the content of indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) and gibberellin 3 (GA 3) in the leaf and stem declined.

40|$|Diurnal {{changes in}} the {{vertical}} profiles of irradiance incident upon the adaxial leaf surface (I), stomatal resistance (rs), leaf water potential (ψ), osmotic potential (π), and turgor potential (P) were followed concurrently in crops of maize (Zea mays L. var. Pa 602 A), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L. ] Moench var. RS 610), and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. var. Havanna Seed 211) on several days in 1968 to 1970 when soil water potentials were high. In all three crops the rs, measured with a ventilated diffusion porometer, the ψ, measured with the pressure chamber, the π, measured with a vapor pressure osmometer, and the calculated P, decreased from sunrise to reach minimum values near midday and then increased again in the afternoon. The diurnal range of all the variables was greater for leaves in the upper canopy than {{for those in the}} lower canopy. P was observed to decrease with decreasing ψ, but never became zero. Sorghum had <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> P at <b>a</b> ψ of, say − 10 bars, than did maize, and maize had <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> P than tobacco at the same ψ. Moreover, at the same ψ the upper leaves in all canopies had <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> P than the lower leaves.

The relation between rs and I in the upper, nonsenescent leaves of all three crops fits a hyperbolic curve, but the response varied with species and leaf senescence.

This study aimed to investigate tillage and P fertilization effects on root distribution and morphology {{of corn and}} soybean. A field corn-soybean rotation experiment established in 1992 at l’Acadie is a split-plot design (4 replicates) with tillage (moldboard plough (MP) and NT) and P fertilization (0 (0 P), 17. 5 (0. 5 P) and 35 (1 P) kg P·ha- 1 every two years) as main and sub-plot factors. Soils and corn roots were sampled in 2014 at silking stage by collecting soil cores to 60 -cm depth (0 - 5, 5 - 10, and every 10 cm) at 5, 15 and 25 cm perpendicularly to the row. Soybean roots were sampled in 2015 at flowering stage. Root length (RL) was determined with WinRHIZO. Corn root length density (RLD) was higher in MP (1. 48 cm·cm- 3) than in NT (1. 28 cm·cm- 3). 0 P and 0. 5 P treatments (1. 29 and 1. 23 cm·cm- 3, respectively) significantly reduced RLD compared to 1 P (1. 62 cm·cm- 3). Corn roots mostly accumulated at 0 - 5 and 5 - 10 cm. Tillage and P fertilization {{had no effect on}} corn root vertical distribution. However, tillage had significant effects on soybean root vertical partition. Soybean in NT had a RLD of 1. 95 cm·cm- 3 on average; and roots mostly accumulated at 0 - 10 cm with 44 % of total RL. MP had lower RLD (1. 55 cm·cm- 3), with the <b>highest</b> <b>RL</b> proportion (36 %) at 10 - 20 cm. Additionally, soybean had relatively higher RLDs in 0 P and 0. 5 P than 1 P.

Gadolinium-loaded, ultra-short single-walled carbon nanotubes (gadonanotubes; GNTs) are shown to have extremely <b>high</b> <b>rl</b> relaxivities (contrast enhancement efficacy), especially at low-magnetic field strengths. The inherent lipophilicity of GNTs provides them the ability to image cells at low magnetic field strength.

The rl relaxivity is ca. 20 times greater than for other paramagnetic Gd-based CAs.

The shoot-through time is used for controlling the dc link voltage boost and hence the output voltage boost of the inverter.

Lett. 8, 91 – 93 (1966); Lang, R. : IEEE J. Quant. Elect. 18 (6), 976 – 983 (1982)). With an unidirectional coupling, optical injection is a basic tool to study synchronization process between oscillators. The dynamics induced in this experiment have been extensively described, theoretically and experimentally (Simpson, T. B. et al. : Quant. Semiclassical Opt. 9 (5), 765 – 784 (1997); Wieczorek S. : Opt.

In this paper, we describe the synchronization on an undamped relaxation regime. In order to study the degree of correlation between the two synchronized lasers (TL and RL), we use a cascade of two optical injections (Guignard, C. : Conference on Lasers and Electro Optics—the Europeen Quant. Electronics Conference (CLEO-EQEC), Munich (Germany), EC 1 M (2003)) thus three lasers: Master-transmitter laser (TL) -receiver laser (RL). The seeding by a field showing undamped relaxations can be directly compared with the optical injection by a CW signal, especially when the injected power and the detuning between the TL and <b>RL</b> <b>frequencies</b> are varied. Synchronization on undamped relaxation are shown to occur at values of the optical injected power and detuning, for which the RL is in the locked or wave-mixing regime when it is seeded by a CW. However, additional tongues of synchronization also exist at detuning equal to the relaxation oscillation frequency (ROF) ...|$|R

Their comparison with that determined for phosphorus, thorium and uranium revealed that the dissolution is clearly incongruent for all the conditions examined.

Moreover, the evaluation of the partial order related to proton concentration and the apparent energy of activation suggest that the reaction of dissolution is probably controlled by surface chemical reactions occurring at the solid/liquid interface. Finally, comparative leaching tests performed in sulphuric acid solutions revealed a significant influence of such media on the chemical durability of the leached pellets, leading to higher normalized dissolution rates for all the elements considered.

30|$|Since {{major changes}} {{have been made in}} the {{fermentation}} conditions for RL production, the time course profile was repeated, using the optimized conditions reached (a 50 : 50 mixture of sugarcane bagasse and sunflower seed meal, an impregnating solution of 20  ml containing 5 %(v/v) glycerol, inoculum size 1 %v/v, pH 8 and incubation temperature of 30  °C). Again, maximum RL production was obtained after 10  days of incubation, however, the RL level this time was about 1.5 fold higher than results obtained in the previous time course study, reaching 46.85  g/l-IS. The obtained value was also about 5.5 folds higher than that obtained using SLF carried out in this study. Moreover, this RL level was obtained in a shorter time than most studies reported so far. In 2008, a maximum RL production of 46  g/l-IS (172  g/kg-IDS) by P. aeruginosa UFPEDA 614 in SSF using a 50 : 50 mixture of sugarcane bagasse and sunflower seed meal with 37.5  ml of impregnating solution containing 10 % v/v glycerol after 12  days was reported (Camilios-Neto et al. 2008). Although our RL yield is comparable with this value when expressed in terms of g/l-IS, our yield expressed in terms of g/kg of solid substrate showed lower values. This may be explained by the smaller volume of impregnating solution used in our study. Moreover, in 2011, the <b>highest</b> <b>RL</b> production of 45  g/l-IS was obtained by the same strain after 12  days of SSF using sugarcane bagasse and corn bran (1 : 1), and an impregnating solution of 35  ml containing 6 % (v/v) of each of glycerol and soybean oil (Camilios-Neto et al. 2011). Therefore, in our study, the mutant 15 GR yielded comparable RL concentrations that were reached in less time and using lower concentrations of carbon source than both these studies. Moreover, although maximum RL concentrations were obtained after 10 days of incubation, <b>high</b> <b>RL</b> levels were already achieved (41.87  g/l-IS (83.74  g/kg-IDS)) by the mutant 15 GR after only 6 days of incubation, unlike Camilios-Neto et al. (2008), whose RL yields reached only about 24  g/l-IS (89  g/kg-IDS) after 6 days of incubation. In addition, in 2017, maximum RL yields of 18.7  g/l was obtained using glycerol as carbon source and rapeseed/wheat bran as matrix (Wu et al. 2017). Our study hence presents an appropriate basis for subsequent studies on RL production using SSF. In conclusion, these results showed that the application of BBD and RSM were successful in enhancing the RL production under SSF by 67 % and a maximum RL concentration of 46.85  g/l-IS was obtained in the present study using a mixture of sugarcane bagasse and sunflower seed meal after only 10  days of incubation. Optimum fermentation conditions were found to be an inoculum size of 1 %v/v, a temperature of 30  °C and a pH of 8. These results suggest that SSF may possibly be a feasible substitute for SLF to produce RLs since our maximum yield was comparable with values that have been obtained in SLF: 23.6  g/l (Noh et al. 2014), 32  g/l (Matsufuji et al. 1997), 36.7  g/l (Muller et al. 2011), and 46  g/l (Linhardt et al. 1989). These findings imply that RL production by P. aeruginosa 15 GR in static tray bioreactors may be successful (Durand 2003). Additional concern to the application of SSF for RL production is hence justified for enhancing RL levels in laboratory-scale work even further and for moving up to pilot scale.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the economic feasibility and socio-economic impacts of biosaline agro-forestry plantations in Haryana India. Five product chains that are derived from the biosaline agro-forestry plantation on salt affected (potentially) waterlogged soils were analysed and compared with the baseline use of similar land before plantation establishment. Every product chain begins with the biomass production phase and has five different output products. These are fuelwood, fuelwood/timber, fuelwood/charcoal, electricity and pulp. The analysis includes all inputs (costs, labour, transportation, energy and processing) to produce an unit of output product (ton or kWh). In this way, the NPV, return on labour (RL), production costs (COP) and labour generated of the biosaline agro-forestry system will be assessed. Also, the potential soil reclamation (phytoremediation function) is assesed and financially valuated by using the substitution cost, land increase value and hedonic price evaluation. The value from these calculations is counted as a benefit in the NPV and RL methods. The five product chains were analysed using 5 different case study sites in Haryana, India. When looking at all the results {{it is clear that the}} biosaline agro-forestry plantations can be economically feasible. It depends however on the plantation set-up. The best model for the biosaline agro-forestry plantation is the use of (relative) high value tree species (E. teriticornis and A. Nilotica) in combination with fast growing intercrop species such a L. fusca. This generates the highest economical return. Although the baseline has <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> NPV and <b>RL</b> as the plantations, a comparison is difficult because of the large uncertainties in the baseline values. The (market) value of the finished products from the different tree species also reflects in the economic performance of the product chains, as well as the conversion efficiency (from tree to output product) and percentage of the tree that can be used for timber and fuel wood. If the aim is the production of fuel wood, timber and charcoal it is best to use high value tree species with <b>a</b> <b>high</b> conversion efficiency (<b>A.</b> nilotica and,to a lesser extend, E. teriticornis). However, if the aim is the production of pulp or electricity, in which the type of tree biomass is not important, it is best to use fast growing tree species such as P. juliflora. Furthermore, electricity production is in all cases (except Gudha) not economically viable. But can be positive because of the added benefits of bringing electricity to isolated rural communities and it’s subsequent development of industries based on the availability of electricity. From a socio-economic point of view, the highest labour generation of 17 man-days/ton is achieved by the fuel wood/timber product chain. The soil improvements caused by the biosaline agro-forestry plantations are evident and substantial. The available soil measurements from before and after plantation show a substantial improvement in the soil quality. Also, the local farmers practiced normal agriculture on the plantation lands for as long as 20 years after the tree plantation was removed. Thus normal agriculture is possible and can be sustained for relative long periods of time after the plantation is removed. The economic value of this phytoremediation function can have an significant effect on the economic feasibility of the plantations, but the best method depends strongly on the specific conditions at the location. The important factors are the severity of the soil conditions, the value and scarcity of land and the value and use of the baseline. But when the method is used the NPV (in the case of the village Puthi) can be more than 3 times higher than without the added benefit...|$|R

The multiple dielectric relaxation loss in NiFe 2 O 4 nanosheets is attributed to the size distribution and morphology of the NiFe 2 O 4 nanosheets. The magnetic loss in the present system is caused mainly by the natural resonance. An absorber with a thickness of 4. 3 mm exhibits an optimal reflection loss (RL) value of - 47. 1 dB at 7. 67 GHz. RL values exceeding - 20 dB in the 2. 68 - 17. 96 GHz range are obtained by choosing an appropriate absorption-layer thickness between 1. 9 and 10 mm. Not only the <b>RL</b> peak <b>frequency</b> but also {{the number of the}} peaks can be well explained by the quarter-wavelength cancellation model...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to measure the upper and lower body aerobic {{capacity}} of semi-elite Rugby League (RL) players. Methods: Twenty-two semi-elite RL players and 24 physically active but untrained men completed a maximal oxygen consumption test (VO 2 max test) on a treadmill and electronic arm ergometer in a randomized order. Percent body fat was calculated from the sum of six skinfolds. Results: Lower and upper body absolute (P= 0. 03 and P= 0. 02 respectively) but not relative VO 2 max was <b>higher</b> in the <b>RL</b> group compared to the control group. Upper body peak power (P= 0. 001), ventilation (P= 0. 05) and lactate concentration (P= 0. 03) were <b>higher</b> in the <b>RL</b> group compared to the control group. Maximum heart rate was lower during arm ergometry for both groups (P ≤ 0. 001) compared to predicted and treadmill values. Conclusions: The results show that while semi-elite RL players have above average lower body aerobic capacity their upper body aerobic capacity is not well developed and similar to untrained men. Coaches and players need to implement separate and dedicated training programs to enhance the development of the upper body aerobic system in RL players. Upper body training should be based on maximal heart rate values achieved during upper body maximal testing...|$|R

The varieties were seeded in a randomized complete block design with 6 replications and 10 plants per plot. The characters evaluated were: plant (PL), shoot (SL) and root (RL) length; total plant (PDM), shoot (SDM), root (RDM) and lateral root (LRDM) dry matter. A lateral root index (LRI) and shoot root dry matter (SRDM = SDM/RDM) and length ratios; (SRL = SL/RL) were calculated. The dwarf varieties (Catuaí, Icatu-caturra, Vila Sarchi, San Ramon, Vila Lobos, São Bernardo) presented higher LRDM and lower SDM than the normal size varieties such as Mundo Novo, Bourbon Vermelho, Arábica, Amarelo de Botucatu, Glaucia, etc. The varieties Macrodiscus, Icatu-caturra, Bourbon Amarelo, Vila Lobos and C. congensis showed higher root development related to shoot. The Arábica coffee standard variety showed intermediary root and shoot development. Genotypes of high yield background were higher in SL and SDM, while the dwarf types had only lower SL than the normal ones, but <b>higher</b> <b>RL</b> and dry matters. Seedlings from genotypes of known higher field drought tolerance had lower SL and <b>RL,</b> but <b>higher</b> RDM. Significant phenotypic and genotypic correlation coefficients were obtained, such the genotypes for PL and PDM (r = 0. 64; P = 0. 01), SL and SDM (r = 0. 40; P = 0. 05), SDM and LRDM (r = 0. 52; P = 0. 05), RDM and LRI (r = 0. 68; P = 0. 01), LRI and SRDM (r = 0. 85; P = 0. 01) and LRI and LRDM (r = 0. 84; P = 0. 01). High genotypic correlations suggest that selection directed to one character will directly affect the other. Conversely, low or non-significant correlations suggest independence of association, an indication {{that it would be}} possible to select two characteristics to diverse directions. Selection could be done towards different goals to change root and shoot measures (length and dry matter) because they were genotypically independent. However, care should be taken in controlling the environmental effects, because of significant positive phenotypic correlations...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis was to investigate a shallow coastal region to compile a detailed environmental picture of its sediment composition and water characteristics and from this model MCM sonar performance at the FBE-H exercise location {{as a means to}} determine what parameters exerted the greatest effect on performance. Seven parameters were intercompared to assess their sensitivity in detecting mines: bottom type, SSP, water depth/sonar depth, mine depth, frequency, sonars and models. Performance was assessed using several measures of effectiveness including the signal to noise ratio and initial detection range. Variations in these measures were analyzed by investigating how TL and RL responded to changing parameters. No one single parameter was identified that affected sonar performance significantly above all others. Of the environmental parameters considered, variations in bottom type exerted the most influence on TL and RL and ultimately on sonar performance. IL was clearly a significant factor when the bottom type is comprised of absorptive, fine- grained material. Of the sonar parameters, frequency exerted a significant impact on performance with TL the most sensitive term in this comparison. <b>A</b> <b>higher</b> TL associated with higher frequency reduced the signal level and consequently the bottom <b>RL.</b> The <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> displayed <b>a</b> stronger SNR than the lower frequency over short ranges, however the higher frequency was limited by TL at greater ranges with the lower frequency achieving greater initial detection ranges[URL] Royal Australian Nav...|$|R

40|$|Fine yellowish-white plaques(YWP), {{which are}} seen in the bowel mucosa of {{patients}} with ulcerative colitis (UC), are minute erosive lesions where infiltration of inflammatory cells are histologically observed. These lesions are thought to constitute the minimum unit of inflammation. To clarify the factors that determine the activity level of UC, we biopsied YWP, which persisted in the inactive stage of the disease, as well as reddish inflamed lesions(RL) in the active stage of the disease, and performed immunoperoxidase staining of intraepithelial cells and lamina propria mononuclear cells by using monoclonal antibodies against various cell markers. Both RL, and YWP showed activation of T cells, B cells and macrophages, compared with the normal mucosa. No decrease in TCR γ δ typeT cells was seen in YWP or RL. An increase in CD 8 positive T cells was noted in YWP. The cell dencities of HLA-DR positive cells was <b>higher</b> in <b>RL</b> than in YWP. As HLA-DR positive cells can act as antigenpresenting cells, this finding may be relevant in determining the activity level of UC...|$|R
