25|$|A band of Pokanoket {{attacked}} several isolated homesteads in {{the small}} Plymouth colony settlement of Swansea on June 20, 1675 (O.S.). They laid siege to the town, then destroyed it five days later and killed several more people. On June 27, 1675 (O.S.) (July 7, 1675 N.S.; See Old Style and New Style dates), a full eclipse of the moon occurred in the New England area. Various tribes in New England looked <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> good omen for attacking the colonists. Officials from the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies responded quickly to the attacks on Swansea; on June 28, they sent a punitive military expedition that destroyed the Wampanoag town at Mount Hope (modern Bristol, Rhode Island).|$|E

This view provides interesting parallels to video gaming, which often requires the gamers to solve various problems using trial-and-error approaches. This paper considers the possibility of formulating optimisation problems in SBSE as video games and discusses challenges that are anticipated. The paper concludes with a demonstration of a proofof-concept implementation that casts test data generation problem <b>as</b> <b>a</b> spatial puzzle. ...|$|R

Due to the revived interest in 3-D technology {{brought on by the}} success of Avatar, talks between Paramount, ILM, and Bay had considered the possibility of the next Transformers film being filmed in 3-D, and testing was performed to bring the technology into Bay's work. Bay originally was not much interested in the format as he felt it did not fit his [...] "aggressive style" [...] of filmmaking, but he was convinced after talks with Avatar director James Cameron, who even offered the technical crew from that film. Cameron reportedly told Bay about 3-D, [...] "You gotta look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> toy, it's another fun tool to help get emotion and character and create an experience." [...] Bay was reluctant to film with 3-D cameras since in test he found them to be too cumbersome for his filming style, but {{he did not want to}} implement the technology in post-production either since he was not pleased with the results. In addition to using the 3-D Fusion camera rigs developed by Cameron's team, Bay and the team spent nine months developing a more portable 3-D camera that could be brought into location.|$|E

2500|$|The {{overwhelmingly}} positive British {{response to}} the film led to its critical and commercial success throughout Europe. Derek Malcolm of Cosmopolitan wrote, [...] " [...] is fast {{becoming one of the}} cult movies of the year ... The great virtue of the film is the way it grabs hold of its audience and simply refuses to let go. It exploits all our fears of irrational violence and unmotivated attack, {{and at the same time}} manages to laugh at itself without spoiling the tension - a very considerable feat. Carpenter, who is clearly a director with places to go, has succeeded in making a comedy that scares the pants off us. And don't think you're laughing <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> matter of fact, it's laughing at you." [...] Malcolm later wrote that he held some reservations about the film: [...] "I don't feel like going on and on about the movie, partly because I think it is in grave danger of being oversold anyway, and partly because it isn't much more to me than tremendous fun". The film broke one house record in the UK and was named one of the best films of the year by critics and moviegoers.|$|E

50|$|The kafana was {{the common}} meeting place for {{consultations}} over village or zadruga affairs.

Women were at the time prevented from kafanas by a strong social prohibition. In the 1900s, young Serbian nationalists in Belgrade met in the city's kafanas where they openly discussed hatred for Austro-Hungary, and desire for Yugoslavism. Gavrilo Princip, the assassin of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, visited those kafanas in 1912.

2500|$|As events transpired, the {{laboratory}} director walked in, received a confession from the instigator, and following a short office visit let Draper {{know that he}} did not have the spirit for scientific research, and would not be going into that field. [...] While Draper thought this a tragedy at the time, he later looked <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> great turning point in his career, freeing him for work that would eventually bring him prominence in his profession. [...] Draper was allowed to finish the course, after which one of his older classmates, Dr. Hugh Cumming, was put in charge of a scientific study of shellfish and water pollution. [...] Cumming then put Draper in charge of a small laboratory in Colonial Beach, Virginia where he spent the next year studying the bacteriological contamination of oysters in the Potomac River. [...] Since both Washington D.C. and Alexandria, Virginia dumped their raw sewage into the river, Draper was to answer the question of whether oysters were affected 68 miles downstream. [...] He discovered that the pollution had been neutralized by natural processes much further upstream, and thus had no effect where he ran most of his tests. [...] The study was important to ease fears that pollution might be affecting the extensive oyster beds near Point Lookout, Maryland, much further downstream.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{actually}} several different legal doctrines {{at work in}} this case. [...] First, the case was decided under United States Supreme Court takings jurisprudence.

New York City, the factors enunciated by Justice Brennan therein have been used to determine when a regulation rises {{to the level of a}} taking thereby requiring just compensation under the Fifth Amendment. [...] Second, since Lochner v. New York the Court has been reluctant to find on due process grounds that economic regulation was beyond the power of Congress. [...] Third, the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 was passed to remedy the insolvent pension plans of the coal mining labors which had been in place since the 1950s. [...] Fourth, and perhaps not independent, the Court examined the ex post facto nature of the effect of the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 on Eastern. [...] The majority examined such under its Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City analysis while the concurrence and the dissents actually looked <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> distinct basis to hold the Congressional Act unconstitutional.|$|E
2500|$|The War of 1812 {{is often}} celebrated in Ontario as a British victory {{for what would}} become Canada in 1867, but Canadian historians in recent decades look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> defeat for the First Nations of Canada, and also for the merchants of Montreal (who lost the fur trade of the Michigan-Minnesota area). The British had a long-standing goal of {{building}} a [...] "neutral" [...] but pro-British Indian buffer state in the American Midwest. They demanded a neutral Indian state at the peace conference in 1814 but failed to gain any of it because they had {{lost control of the}} region in the Battle of Lake Erie and the Battle of the Thames in 1813, where Tecumseh was killed. The British then abandoned the Indians south of the lakes. The royal elite of (what is now) Ontario gained much more power in the aftermath and used that power to repel American ideas such as democracy and republicanism, especially in those areas of Ontario settled primarily by Americans. Many of those settlers returned to the states and were replaced by immigrants from Britain who were imperial-minded. W. L. Morton says the war was a [...] "stalemate" [...] but the Americans [...] "did win the peace negotiations." [...] Arthur Ray says the war made [...] "matters worse for the native people" [...] as they lost military and political power. Bumsted says the war was a stalemate but regarding the Indians [...] "was a victory for the American expansionists."
