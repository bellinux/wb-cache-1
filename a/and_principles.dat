5|$|Daoism and Buddhism {{were the}} {{dominant}} religions of China in the Song era, the latter deeply impacting many beliefs <b>and</b> <b>principles</b> of Neo-Confucianism throughout the dynasty. Ironically, Buddhism came under heavy criticism by staunch Confucian advocates and philosophers of the time. Older beliefs in ancient Chinese mythology, folk religion, and ancestor worship {{also played a}} large part in people's daily lives, as the Chinese believed that deities and ghosts of the spiritual realm frequently interacted with the living realm.|$|E

5|$|In modern history, orators such as Henry Clay would mimic Demosthenes's technique. His ideas <b>and</b> <b>principles</b> survived, {{influencing}} prominent {{politicians and}} movements of our times. Hence, he constituted {{a source of}} inspiration for the authors of The Federalist Papers (a series of 85 essays arguing for the ratification of the United States Constitution) and for the major orators of the French Revolution. French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau was among those who idealised Demosthenes and wrote a book about him. For his part, Friedrich Nietzsche often composed his sentences according to the paradigms of Demosthenes, whose style he admired.* P. J. M. Van Tongeren, Reinterpreting Modern Culture, 92.|$|E

50|$|Archimedes principle, {{relating}} buoyancy to {{the weight}} of displaced water, is an early example of a law in science. Another early one developed by Malthus is the population principle, now called the Malthusian principle. Freud also wrote on principles, especially the reality principle necessary to keep the id <b>and</b> pleasure <b>principle</b> in check. Biologists use the <b>principle</b> of priority <b>and</b> <b>principle</b> of Binominal nomenclature for precision in naming species. There are many principles observed in physics, notably in cosmology which observes the mediocrity principle, the anthropic principle, the <b>principle</b> of relativity <b>and</b> the cosmological <b>principle.</b> Other well-known principles include the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics <b>and</b> the pigeonhole <b>principle</b> <b>and</b> superposition <b>principle</b> in mathematics.|$|R
5|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century, English {{merchant}} law was still {{based on the}} Lex mercatoria, a medieval series of customs <b>and</b> <b>principles</b> used to regulate trading. Other countries in Europe had reformed and modernised their law, resulting in English merchant law being about a century behind mercantile law of other European countries. A merchant was, by his very nature, international, and the inconsistencies between English law and the law of other nations made business difficult.|$|E

The Court of Appeal recognized a rule of customary international law that had been received into the common law, that is, the presumption against extraterritoriality, and ascribed to Parliament the intent to uphold that rule for the purposes of construing a statutory provision.|$|E
5|$|Marvin Bower is {{credited}} with creating McKinsey's values <b>and</b> <b>principles</b> in 1937. He established a set of rules: that consultants should put the interests of clients before McKinsey's revenues, not discuss client affairs, tell the truth {{even if it means}} challenging the client's opinion, and only perform work that is both necessary and that McKinsey can do well. Bower created the firm's principle of only working with CEOs, which was later expanded to CEOs of subsidiaries and divisions. He also created McKinsey's principle of only working with clients the firm felt would follow its advice.|$|E

5|$|The Region Cadet Leadership Schools (RCLS) provide {{training}} to increase knowledge, skills, and attitudes as they pertain to leadership and management. To {{be eligible to}} attend, cadets must be serving in, or preparing to enter, cadet leadership positions within their squadron. RCLSs are conducted at region level, or at wing level with region approval. The RCLS programs {{are more or less}} modeled on USAFA upper classmen programs, the college Air Force ROTC Professional Officer Course (POC) and latter stages of OTS. One variation on this theme are CAP Cadet Non-Commissioned Officer Schools and Academies, which are cadet NCO schools designed to teach basic leadership <b>and</b> <b>principles</b> to cadet leaders during their earlier duty positions in the cadet program.|$|E
5|$|The {{philosophy}} <b>and</b> <b>principles</b> of Tulsidas {{are found}} across his works, and are especially {{outlined in the}} dialogue between Kakbhushundi and Garuda in the Uttar Kand of the Ramcharitmanas.

At the beginning of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas says that his work is in accordance with various scriptures – the Puranas, Vedas, Upavedas, Tantra and Smriti. Ram Chandra Shukla in his critical work Hindi Sahitya Ka Itihaas elaborates on Tulsidas' Lokmangal as the doctrine for social upliftment which made this great poet immortal and comparable to any other world littérateur.|$|E

40|$|We usually use {{a set of}} ideas, {{thinking}} paradigms {{and judgment}} rules, including alternatives, criteria, outcomes, preferences, to make decision. This set, known as actual domain (working knowledge) of habitual domain, will be stabilized over time unless extraordinary events occur. As such, our working knowledge cannot be broad and deep. Inevitably, we could get into decision traps, which lead us to making wrong decision or solving wrong problems. The actual domain {{is only a small}} part of our potential domain, the collection of all thoughts, ideas, thinking paradigms, etc. that have ever been encoded in our brain. In this paper, we will describe nine principles for deep knowledge, so that, we could expand and enrich our working knowledge by utilizing the potential domains of ourselves and other participants in the decision making. As a consequence, good ideas for solving challenging decision problems can be obtained or created. These principles are: The deep <b>and</b> down <b>principle,</b> the alternating <b>principle,</b> the contrasting <b>and</b> complementing <b>principle,</b> the revolving <b>and</b> cycling <b>principle,</b> the inner connection <b>principle,</b> the changing <b>and</b> transforming <b>principle,</b> the contradiction <b>principle,</b> the cracking <b>and</b> ripping <b>principle,</b> the void principle.

40|$|This thesis, called "Environmental <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> their {{application}} in international, EU and czech law", discusses {{the nature and}} application of the principles in the law generally, namely in international law, law of the European union and czech law.

Author attempts to show (through analysis of concrete normative documents a texts) the usage <b>and</b> application of <b>principles</b> in legal praxis. The importance of the principles is also emphasized {{from the point of view}} of concrete judicial cases, in which principles have been explicitly mentioned. Author mainly focuses on the following principles (see 3 rd chapter, which represents the crucial part of the thesis) : principle of the highest value, principle of the common interest of mankind, principle of the right to favourable environment, principle of the sustainable environment, principle of the participation of the public <b>and</b> <b>principle</b> of information, principle of prevention, precautionary principle, principles of the responsibility <b>and</b> <b>principle</b> of integration <b>and</b> <b>principle</b> of protection complexity...|$|R
