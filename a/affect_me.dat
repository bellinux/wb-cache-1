5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it <b>affect</b> <b>me</b> because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E
500|$|According to Aguilera herself, [...] "Oh Mother" [...] {{talks about}} her abusive childhood. She revealed, [...] "I think going through what I went through {{at a young age}} [...] the abuse that went on in my {{household}} [...] did <b>affect</b> <b>me</b> a lot. Domestic violence is a topic that is very hush-hush in society". Aguilera recalls the domestic violence of her childhood as she sings, [...] "He took his anger out on her face, she kept all of her pain locked away". Nick Levine for Digital Spy said that [...] "Oh Mother" [...] is a [...] "retread" [...] of [...] "I'm OK", a song with the same topic from Aguilera's 2002 album Stripped.|$|E
500|$|While Eddy {{argued that}} reality was entirely spiritual (and {{therefore}} entirely good), it remained true {{that human beings}} were affected by their belief in evil, which meant it had power, even if the power was an illusion. Evil was [...] "like a bankrupt to whom credit is still granted," [...] writes Wilson. To defend herself against it, Eddy organized [...] "watches," [...] during which students (known as mental or metaphysical workers) would give [...] "adverse treatment" [...] to her enemies. This was called [...] "taking up the enemy in thought." [...] According to former students, Eddy would tell them to say (often with Richard Kennedy in mind): [...] "You are affected as you wish to <b>affect</b> <b>me.</b> Your evil thought reacts upon you," [...] then call Kennedy bilious, consumptive or poisoned by arsenic.|$|E
60|$|I {{have never}} known exactly in how odd a way this odd old man <b>affected</b> <b>me.</b> I only know that for some reason or other he so <b>affected</b> <b>me</b> that I was, within a few minutes, in the street outside.|$|R

500|$|By April 2008, Zinta had {{completed}} shooting for Jahnu Barua's drama Har Pal. In {{the same year}} she played the leading role of Chand in Deepa Mehta's Canadian film Heaven on Earth, a Punjabi language mystical drama based on {{the true story of}} a young Indian woman who, after an arranged marriage to a non-resident Indian man from Canada, migrates to Toronto and becomes a victim of severe domestic abuse. Expressing her desire for [...] "a new kind of acting challenge", Zinta described Mehta as one director she was longing to work with to fulfill it. To prepare for the part, she read and watched several books and documentaries on domestic violence. As the film was to be shot entirely in Punjabi, a language that was totally alien to her, she learnt it in a crash course of fifty days. She was emotional during the making of the film: [...] "I never knew a character would <b>affect</b> <b>me</b> so deeply. I've become completely withdrawn and introspective... I can't snap out of the character." [...] She eventually called it her most challenging project, as it helped her [...] "shed everything that Preity Zinta was about." [...] Heaven on Earth was first screened at several film festivals and, upon release, garnered career-best reviews for Zinta. Her performance earned her the Silver Hugo Award for Best Actress at the 2008 Chicago International Film Festival, for [...] "her strong yet subtle performance as a woman struggling to keep her dreams despite brutal realities." [...] Among other awards, she was acknowledged with Best Actress nominations at several award functions in Canada, including the Genie Award by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, and the Vancouver Film Critics Circle.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the pride}} parade, Libertatea sought to {{investigate}} {{the opinion of the}} public with regard to the event. According to its findings, the majority of those interviewed saw the parade as something [...] "perfectly normal in a democratic country". One passer-by stated, [...] "It's good that they're expressing their views. It's their business what sexual inclinations they have. As long as they don't <b>affect</b> <b>me</b> with anything, they can do what they want. If the City Hall gave them permission to organise a meeting, why wouldn't they do it? Today, people hold meetings for everything." [...] Another interviewee remarked, [...] "Their manifestation doesn't <b>affect</b> <b>me</b> in any way. They can do what they want if the City Hall gave them the right. They can affirm their opinions, they can ask for their rights, since we live in a free country." ...|$|E
2500|$|Slash's {{friendship}} with GunsN'Roses frontman Axl Rose soured following his {{departure from the}} band. In 2006, Rose claimed that Slash had shown up at his house uninvited the previous year to offer a truce. He alleged that Slash had insulted his Velvet Revolver bandmates, telling Rose that he considered Scott Weiland [...] "a fraud" [...] and Duff McKagan [...] "spineless", and that he [...] "hated" [...] Matt Sorum. Slash denied the accusations. In his 2007 autobiography he admitted to visiting Rose's home with the intention to settle a longstanding legal dispute and make peace with his former bandmate. He claims, however, {{that he did not}} speak with Rose and instead merely left a note. Slash maintains that he had not spoken with Rose in person since 1996. In 2009, in response to a statement by Rose in which he referred to Slash as [...] "a cancer", Slash commented: [...] "It doesn't really <b>affect</b> <b>me</b> at all... It's been a long time. The fact that he has anything to say at all, it's like, 'Whatever, dude.' It doesn't really matter." [...] In an August 2015 interview, [...] Slash stated that he is now on good terms with Rose. Slash also rejoined Guns N' Roses in 2016.|$|E

2500|$|Immediately {{following}} the incident, Timberlake sounded unapologetic for his actions, telling Access Hollywood, [...] "Hey man, we love giving you all {{something to talk}} about." [...] Timberlake released a statement saying [...] "I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl. It was not intentional and is regrettable." [...] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying [...] "I know it's been a rough week on everybody. What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended." [...] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, [...] "All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'" [...] Timberlake said. [...] "I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation. I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And {{the fact of the}} matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music." [...] Timberlake later declared, [...] "It was something that went wrong. Then I felt like, I'm going to show everyone that this was something that didn't <b>affect</b> <b>me,</b> and I'm going to show up at the Grammys." [...] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse. While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, [...] "In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And if there was something I could have done in her defense that was more than I realized then, I would have. But the other half of me was like, 'Wow. We still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction and everybody cares about this!'" [...] He added, [...] "I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society ... I think that America's harsher on women. And I think that America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people." ...|$|E
