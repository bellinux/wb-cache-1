Everything I did for them was mostly good and everything they did to me was mostly bad.|$|E
500|$|Ford was {{the only}} person to hold the {{president}}ial office without being elected as either president or vice-president. The choice of Ford to fulfill Spiro Agnew's vacated role as vice president was based on Ford's reputation for openness and honesty. [...] "In <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> sat in the House, I never knew Mr. Ford to make a dishonest statement nor a statement part-true and part-false. He never attempted to shade a statement, and I never heard him utter an unkind word," [...] said Martha Griffiths.|$|E
2500|$|In El Obeid, Bakhita {{was bought}} by a very rich Arab from Arab slave traders who used her as a maid in service to his two daughters. They liked her and treated her well. But after {{offending}} one of her owner's sons, possibly for breaking a vase, the son lashed and kicked her severely that she {{spent more than a}} month unable to move from her straw bed. Her fourth owner was a Turkish general and she had to serve his mother-in-law and his wife who both were very cruel to all their slaves. Bakhita says: [...] "During <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> stayed in that house, I do not recall a day that passed without some wound or other. When a wound from the whip began to heal, other blows would pour down on me." ...|$|E

60|$|The days went by, and {{to others}} grouped {{themselves}} into weeks and months; to me they were only days--not Saturday, Sunday, Monday, but nameless. They were so many and their sum so great that all my previous life, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> had existed before this solitary time, now looked like a small island immeasurably far away, scarcely discernible, {{in the midst of}} that endless desolate waste of nameless days.|$|E

60|$|I sought my bed, but in it {{knew little}} of sleep.

6000|$|... "No," [...] he said; [...] "this is immediate, and I {{have two}} churches, reredos and walls, on my hands, enough to last me <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> Nor could <b>I</b> throw over Eccles and Beamster." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ay, even now, {{in those}} dreams which still come when Sleep unlocks the secret heart, and sets its terrors free to roam through the opened halls of Thought, I {{seem to see}} her royal form, as erst I saw it, come with arms outstretched and Love's own light shining in her eyes, with lips apart and flowing locks, and stamped upon her face the look of utter {{tenderness}} that she alone could wear. Ay, still, after <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>years,</b> <b>I</b> seem to see her come as erst she came, and still I wake to know her an unutterable lie! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I like {{teaching}}, too," [...] said Gilbert. [...] "It's good training, for one thing.

60|$|So {{this was}} love! I had escaped it for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> had roamed the five continents and their {{encircling}} seas; {{in spite of}} beautiful women and urging opportunity; {{in spite of a}} half-desire for love and a constant search for my ideal, it had remained for me to fall furiously and hopelessly in love with a creature from another world, of a species similar possibly, yet not identical with mine. A woman who was hatched from an egg, and whose span of life might cover a thousand years; whose people had strange customs and ideas; a woman whose hopes, whose pleasures, whose standards of virtue and of right and wrong might vary as greatly from mine as did those of the green Martians.|$|E
60|$|She. This once yes and {{a second}} time, and again and again, <b>all</b> through <b>the</b> <b>years</b> when <b>I</b> shall be unable to resent it. You want too much, my Lancelot, and, you know too much.|$|R

6000|$|... "No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim {{purpose in}} what I do, and I warn {{you that you}} do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of others if not for your own." [...] Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might well be, he went on more gently, [...] "Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear me. I only do for your good, but there is much virtue to you in those so common flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the wreath that you are to wear. But hush! No telling to others that make so {{inquisitive}} questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience, and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait for you. Now sit still a while. Come with me, friend John, and you shall help me deck the room with my garlic, which is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way from Haarlem, where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass houses <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> <b>I</b> had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was on the}} beach, {{close down}} by the sea, that I found them. It {{would have been easy}} to {{perceive}} that they had not slept all last night, even if Peggotty had failed to tell me of their still sitting just as I left them, when it was broad day. They looked worn; and I thought Mr. Peggotty's head was bowed in one night more than in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> had known him. But they were both as grave and steady as the sea itself, then lying beneath a dark sky, waveless--yet with a heavy roll upon it, as if it breathed in its rest--and touched, on the horizon, with a strip of silvery light from the unseen sun.|$|E
6000|$|... "On {{the date}} I have just mentioned--I mean the fifteenth of the month--my master himself {{informed}} {{me that he had}} been dreadfully disappointed by a letter received from you, which had come in the morning from foreign parts, and had brought him bad news. He did not tell me what the news was--but I have never, in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> have passed in the admiral's service, seen him so distressingly upset, and so unlike himself, as he was on that day. At night his uneasiness seemed to increase. He was in such a state of irritation that he could not bear the sound of Mr. Mazey's hard breathing outside his door, and he laid his positive orders on the old man to go into one of the bedrooms for that night. Mr. Mazey, to his own great regret, was of course obliged to obey.|$|E
6000|$|... 'At the time,' he concluded, 'no doubt {{whatever}} {{entered my}} mind, {{that the person}} who called upon me was Miss Hawtrey. Thinking it over now, and having an absolute confidence in her, I see that I may have been mistaken; she was veiled when she entered, and in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> have known Miss Hawtrey I have never seen her wear a veil. A veil certainly alters the appearance of a face, and for an instant when she entered I did not recognise her, but the likeness must be very great, for my hesitation was only momentary. Afterwards she had a handkerchief up to her face during the greater part of the interview, and during the whole time she spoke in a low voice broken by sobs. No doubt there must be some similarity between the voices, but heard in that way it was so different from her usual outspoken tones, that I should be sorry to be called upon to swear whether at other times it would resemble her voice or not.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not as you do," [...] said Old Mother Nature. [...] "In {{very cold}} weather he sleeps, but if {{he happens to be}} living where the weather does not get very cold, he is active <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> around.

6000|$|... "Of course I will!" [...] {{answered}} Polychrome, with a merry laugh. [...] "I've never kissed {{a mortal}} man in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> thousands of <b>years</b> <b>I</b> have existed, but I'll {{do it to}} please our faithful Shaggy Man, whose unselfish affection for his ugly brother deserves to be rewarded." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{white man}} should eat {{like a white}} man, dash it all," [...] he burst out impetuously. [...] "Ought to eat meat, must eat meat.

6000|$|... "Lass, {{you stand}} by your convictions," [...] he said, impressively. [...] "An' Moore, {{you be a}} man an' don't make it so hard for her. Neither of you can do anythin'....

Lookin' back over <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> remember many boys like this Buster Jack, an' I remember how {{in the nature of}} their doin's they just hanged themselves. I've a queer foresight about people whose trouble I've made my own. It's somethin' that never fails. When their trouble's goin' to turn out bad then I feel a terrible yearnin' {{to tell the story of}} Hell-Bent Wade. That foresight of trouble gave me my name.... But it's not operatin' here.... An' so, my young friends, you can believe me when I say somethin' will happen. As far as October first is concerned, or any time near, Collie isn't goin' to marry Jack Belllounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|The nearest, {{which is}} the artist's {{favourite}} point, is from the meadows; there, from the waterside, you have the cathedral not too far away nor too near for a picture, whether on canvas or in the mind, standing amidst its great old trees, with nothing but the moist green meadows and the river between. One evening, during the late summer of this wettest season, when the rain was beginning to cease, I went out this way for my stroll, the pleasantest if not the only [...] "walk" [...] there is in Salisbury. It is true, there are two others: one to Wilton by its long, shady avenue; the other to Old Sarum; but these are now motor-roads, and until the loathed hooting and dusting engines are thrust away into roads of their own there is little pleasure in them for the man on foot. The rain ceased, but the sky was still stormy, with a great blackness beyond the cathedral and still other black clouds {{coming up from the}} west behind me. Then the sun, near its setting, broke out, sending a flame of orange colour through the dark masses around it, {{and at the same time}} flinging a magnificent rainbow on that black cloud against which the immense spire stood wet with rain and flushed with light, so that it looked like a spire built of a stone impregnated with silver. Never had Nature so glorified man's work! It was indeed a marvellous thing to see, an effect so rare that in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> had known Salisbury, and the many times I had taken that stroll in all weathers, it was my first experience of such a thing. How lucky, then, was Constable to have seen it, when he set himself to paint his famous picture! And how brave he was and even wise to have attempted such a subject, one which, I am informed by artists with the brush, only a madman would undertake, however great a genius he might be. It was impossible, we know, even to a Constable, but we admire his failure nevertheless, even as we admire Turner's many failures; but when we go back to Nature we are only too glad to forget all about the picture.|$|E
60|$|At {{the head}} of the Cheddar valley, a couple of miles from the cathedral city of Wells, the Somerset Axe is born, gushing out noisily, a mighty volume of clear cold water, from a cavern in a black precipitous rock on the hillside. This cavern is called Wookey Hole, and above it the rough wall is draped with ivy and fern, and many small {{creeping}} plants and flowery shrubs rooted in the crevices; and in the holes in the rock the daws have their nests. They are a numerous and a vociferous colony, but the noise of their loudest cawings, when they rush out like a black cloud and are most excited, is almost drowned by the louder roar of the torrent beneath--the river's great cry of liberty and joy on issuing from the blackness in the hollow of the hills into the sunshine of heaven and the verdure of that beautiful valley. The Axe finishes its course fifteen miles away, for 'tis a short river, but they are pleasant miles in one of the fairest vales in the west of England, rich in cattle and in corn. And at the point where it flows into the Severn Sea stands Brean Down, a huge isolated hill, the last of the Mendip range on that side. It has a singular appearance: it might be likened in its form to a hippopotamus standing on the flat margin of an African lake, its breast and mouth touching the water, and all its body belly-deep in the mud; it is, in fact, a hill or a promontory united to the mainland by a strip of low flat land--a huge, oblong, saddle-backed hill projected into the sea towards Wales. Down at its foot, at the point where it touches the mainland, close to the mouth of the Axe, there is a farmhouse, and the farmer is the tenant of the entire hill, and uses it as a sheep-walk. The sheep and rabbits and birds are the only inhabitants. I remember a delightful experience I had one cold windy but very bright spring morning near the farmhouse. There is there, at a spot where one is able to ascend the steep hill, a long strip of rock that looks like the wall of a gigantic ruined castle, rough and black, draped with ancient ivy and crowned with furze and bramble and thorn. Here, coming out of the cold wind to the shelter of this giant ivy-draped black wall, I stood still to enjoy the sensations of warmth and a motionless air, when high above appeared a swift-moving little cloud of linnets, seemingly blown across the sky by the gale; but quite suddenly, when directly over me, the birds all came straight down, to drop like a shower of small stones into the great masses of ivy and furze and bramble. And no sooner had they settled, vanishing into that warm and windless greenery, than they simultaneously burst into such a concert of sweetest wild linnet music, that I was enchanted, and thought that never in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>I</b> had spent in the haunts of wild birds had I heard anything so fairy-like and beautiful.|$|E
5000|$|Nominations {{closed on}} 17 June, when a {{university}} spokesman confirmed that all four candidates had secured {{the level of}} support needed to get on to the ballot paper.
