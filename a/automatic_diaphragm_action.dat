50|$|The Zunow SLR, {{which went}} on sale in 1958 (in Japan only), was the first 35mm SLR camera with an <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> which stopped down to the {{preselected}} aperture upon release of the shutter. (Although this invention had been anticipated by the 1954 Praktina FX-A which featured a semi-automatic diaphragm, which stopped down automatically, but had to be opened manually after the exposure.) The <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> feature eliminated one downside to viewing with an SLR: the darkening of the viewfinder screen image when the photographer selected a small lens aperture. The Zunow Optical Company also supplied the Miranda Camera Company with lenses for their Miranda T SLR cameras.|$|R
5000|$|A lens with an [...] "automatic" [...] {{diaphragm}} {{allows the}} photographer {{to forget about}} closing the diaphragm to shooting aperture; such diaphragms have been taken for granted for decades. Usually this means a pin or lever {{on the back of}} the lens is pushed or released by a part of the shutter release mechanism in the camera body; the external <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragms</b> on lenses for Exakta and Miranda cameras were the exception to that. Some lenses had [...] "semi-automatic" [...] diaphragms that closed to shooting aperture like an <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> but had to be re-opened manually with a flip of a ring on the lens.|$|R
5000|$|Auto — Designation for F-type lenses {{indicating}} an <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> (aperture). Not to {{be confused}} with automatic exposure or auto focus, the designation fell out of use in the early 1970s and was not carried onto K-type lenses.|$|R

50|$|When {{the shutter}} release is pressed the mirror flips {{up against the}} viewing screen, the {{diaphragm}} closes down (if automatic), the shutter opens and closes, the mirror returns to its 45-degree viewing position (on most or all 35 mm SLRs made since 1970) and the <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> re-opens to full aperture.|$|R

50|$|The {{front brake}} caliper was resited {{to the rear}} of the fork leg and the front master {{cylinder}} reservoir shape was changed. A hazard switch was added.

The manual operation fuel tap was replaced with an <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> unit. A rear disc brake replaced the earlier drum.|$|R
50|$|In May 1959, the Canonflex SLR was introduced. The camera {{featured}} a quick return mirror, an <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and was introduced with an interchangeable black pentaprism housing. It also featured newly developed 'R' series breech lock mount lenses. This SLR was superseded by the Canonflex RM, a fixed prism SLR which {{featured a}} built-in selenium cell meter. Later came the Canonflex R2000, {{with a top}} shutter speed of 1/2000 of a second. This model was also superseded by the Canonflex RM.|$|R
25|$|The {{first attempt}} to make {{high-end}} professional camera by KMZ was the Start in 1958. This camera had {{a full set of}} shutter speeds (from 1 sec to 1/1000), a lens with an <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> in a unique breech-lock mount, and even a knife for cutting-off part of the unexposed film. The photographer could choose between a pentaprism and waist-level finders. The grave disadvantage of the Start is blamed on lack of lenses; only one lens (the Helios-44 f2/58) was ever made for the proprietary Start mount directly.|$|R
2500|$|The first SLR cameras with {{internal}} (“through-the-lens” or “TTL”) meters (e.g., the Pentax Spotmatic) {{required that the}} lens is stopped down to the working aperture when taking a meter reading. [...] With a small aperture, this darkened the viewfinder, making viewing, focusing, and composition difficult. Subsequent models soon incorporated mechanical coupling between the lens and the camera body, indicating the working aperture to the camera while allowing the lens to be at its maximum aperture for composition and focusing; this feature became known as automatic aperture control or <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> control.|$|R

5000|$|Like its FL predecessor, the FD {{mount system}} allowed <b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> function, but in addition, a new signal pin {{supported}} full-aperture metering. A second signal pin for the [...] "auto" [...] {{setting of the}} aperture dial, plus a linkage to allow the camera to set the degree of diaphragm opening, enabled integral auto-exposure. The first camera to utilize this was the 1971 Canon F-1, when equipped with the Servo EE Finder. Later, the Canon EF of 1973 had automatic exposure built-in, as did the very popular Canon A-series cameras (save the AT-1) beginning in 1976.|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of precast r/c structures to earthquake strongly {{depends on the}} <b>diaphragm</b> <b>action</b> that slab and roof-decks are able to provide. In {{the framework of a}} research project, recently concluded, two true-scale mock-ups of precast r/c one storey buildings were submitted to pseudo-dynamic and cyclic tests. Through a plentiful set of suitably placed measuring instruments the behavior of the different elements of the roof deck was closely monitored and information on the efficacy of the overall diaphragm behavior, {{as well as of the}} adopted capacity-design procedure, was thus garnered. This paper, after having briefly recalled the main experimental results of the project, with reference to the topic at issue, investigates the role of parameters such as the roof panel and beam span, the gap between roof elements etc. for a wide and robust assessment of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>action</b> of paneled roof decks in precast one-storey buildings.

40|$|The {{provisions}} {{for developing a}} beam-and-post building system of glulam are examined for the Swedish market. The building system should provide open spaces through long-span floors combined with apartment floors, reaching a total height of 5 - 6 stories. Building multi-storey houses in timber requires a strong and stiff stabilizing system assuring safety and comfort for their users. Large movements are unacceptable risking damage on interior claddings and even nausea with the inhabitants on the upper floors. Stabilization can be achieved through diagonal bracing, moment stiff connections or <b>diaphragm</b> <b>action.</b> In this work a special stabilizing element based on <b>diaphragm</b> <b>action</b> is proposed. A parametric study of the stabilization system against lateral loads for a beam-and-post building system is presented based on traditional and numerical analyses. The aim of the paper is to establish the limitations for the stabilizing element to function within a multi-storey beam-and-post system.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In the {{investigation}} of patients with myasthenia gravis, repetitive supramaximal stimulation of an affected peripheral nerve is commonly performed to detect abnormal transmission at the neuromuscular junction. A study was undertaken to determine whether abnormal transmission could similarly be detected during stimulation of the phrenic nerves. METHODS: The phrenic nerves were stimulated supramaximally with surface electrodes in 13 patients with myasthenia gravis and in 16 control subjects (six control patients with diaphragmatic weakness but not with myasthenia and ten normal subjects). The amplitude of <b>diaphragm</b> muscle <b>action</b> potentials was measured with surface electrodes during phrenic nerve stimulation at frequencies of 1 - 5 Hz for 3 - 4 seconds. RESULTS: In five patients with myasthenia gravis, a significant decrement (15 - 43 % decrease) occurred in the amplitude of <b>diaphragm</b> muscle <b>action</b> potential during stimulation at 3 Hz. When stimulation frequency was reduced to 1 Hz, <b>diaphragm</b> muscle <b>action</b> potentials returned to their original amplitude within 4 - 5 seconds. The decrement in the amplitude of the <b>diaphragm</b> muscle <b>action</b> potential was reduced temporarily in three of four patients after the administration of intravenous edrophonium chloride (Tensilon). There was no significant change (< 10 % decrease) in the amplitude of <b>diaphragm</b> muscle <b>action</b> potentials during stimulation at increased frequencies either in the 16 control subjects or in eight of the patients with myasthenia gravis. CONCLUSION: A significant reduction in the amplitude of <b>diaphragm</b> muscle <b>action</b> potential occurred in five of 13 patients with myasthenia gravis during phrenic nerve stimulation at 3 Hz but in none of the control subjects. This may be a useful and non-invasive method for identifying patients with myasthenia gravis in whom weakness of the diaphragm is suspected...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} six full-scale {{laboratory tests}} conducted on cold-formed steel portal frames buildings {{in order to}} investigate the effects of joint flexibility and stressed-skin <b>diaphragm</b> <b>action.</b> The frames used for the laboratory tests were of span of 6 m, height of 3 m and pitch of 10 °; the frame spacing was 3 m. The laboratory test setup represented buildings of length of 9 m, having two gable frames and two internal frames. Tests were conducted on frames having two joint sizes, both with and without roof cladding. It was shown {{that as a result}} of stressed-skin <b>diaphragm</b> <b>action,</b> under horizontal load the bending moment at the eaves was reduced by approximately a factor of three, relative to the bare frame. It was also shown {{that as a result of}} stressed-skin action, the deflection of the internal frame reduced by 90 %, and that the stiffness was independent of joint flexibility. On the other hand, owing to redistribution of bending moment from the eaves to the apex, the effect of joint flexibility was shown not to be significant on the overall failure load of the frame...|$|R
40|$|A {{large part}} of the {{building}} stock in seismic-prone areas worldwide are masonry structures that have been designed without seismic design considerations. Proper seismic assessment of such structures is quite a challenge, particularly so if their response well into the inelastic range, up to local or global failure, has to be predicted, as typically required in fragility analysis. A critical issue in this respect is the absence of rigid <b>diaphragm</b> <b>action</b> (due to the presence of relatively flexible floors), which renders particularly cumbersome the application of popular and convenient nonlinear analysis methods like the static pushover analysis. These issues are addressed in this paper that focusses on a masonry building representative of Southern European practice, which is analysed in both its pristine condition and after applying retrofitting schemes typical of those implemented in pre-earthquake strengthening programmes. Nonlinear behaviour is evaluated using dynamic response-history analysis, which is found to be more effective and even easier to apply in this type of building wherein critical modes are of a local nature, due to the absence of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>action.</b> Fragility curves are then derived for both the initial and the strengthened building, exploring alternative definitions of seismic damage states, including some proposals originating from recent international research programmes...|$|R
50|$|In {{structural}} engineering, {{a diaphragm}} is a structural element that transmits lateral loads to the vertical resisting {{elements of a}} structure (such as shear walls or frames). Diaphragms are typically horizontal, but can be sloped such as in a gable roof on a wood structure or concrete ramp in a parking garage. The diaphragm forces tend {{to be transferred to}} the vertical resisting elements primarily through in-plane shear stress. The most common lateral loads to be resisted are those resulting from wind and earthquake actions, but other lateral loads such as lateral earth pressure or hydrostatic pressure can also be resisted by <b>diaphragm</b> <b>action.</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceHorizontal {{stability}} of the medium rise steel frame structures is usually ensured by vertical bracings and <b>diaphragm</b> <b>action</b> of composite floors. Load transfer within the composite floor system is made through shear connectors, e. g. headed studs. In an event of explosion, such connectors must reserve sufficient residual stiffness and strength {{in order to avoid}} a sudden or delayed collapse of the building. These remaining capacities have not been experimentally studied yet in the literature. This paper presents large scale horizontal push out tests to determine the residual stiffness of the shear connectors after being initially damaged by explosion. The initial damaging is reproduced by a pull-out test using a quasi-static loading.

5000|$|The company {{retained}} the same lens mount on the Swiss made cameras from 1942 until they ended production. The back {{focus of the}} body was the thinnest of any 35 mm camera, and as a result, {{it was possible to}} make adapters to use lenses designed for almost any other 35 mm SLR on an Alpa. Adapters offered included Exakta, M42 (<b>automatic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and manual), Nikon (auto and manual), Leicaflex, T-mount, and Contax. Other adapters included one to allow mounting Alpa lenses to C-mount movie cameras and another to mount the Alpa bodies to a microscope. Alpa did not make their own lenses, and sourced them through some of the best lens makers—Angenieux, Kern, Kinoptik, Schneider, and others. They were the only company to guarantee optical quality of the lenses they sold. The clearness of the pentaprism in the Alpa models, and the use of [...] "rings" [...] of different surfaces in the eyepiece of the 11 series especially made them a great choice for using on a T-mount, attached to large telescopes. Coupled with the manual mirror raise switch, even the vibration of the mirror slap was removed.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{sandwich}} panels as {{roof and}} wall claddings has increased considerably in recent times. For the designers {{to take advantage}} of the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>action</b> of stronger sandwich panel systems under in-plane shear forces due to wind loading, appropriate data on shear strength and stiffness of these systems is required. An experimental investigation was therefore conducted to investigate the shear behaviour of commonly used crest-fixed sandwich panel systems. An improved fastening system was developed which resulted in approximately 2. 5 times greater shear strength, and improved ductility. Shear strength and stiffness data were developed for sandwich panel systems with the improved fastening system for varying aspect ratio. Analytical formulae were also developed to predict the shear strength of sandwich panel systems using the basic tearing loads obtained from simple connection tests. This paper presents the details of both experimental and analytical studies on the shear behaviour of sandwich panel systems and the results...|$|R

Crest-fixed claddings (up to a maximum size of 6 x 6. 2 m) with different aspect ratio and fastening systems were tested to failure, based on which suitable shear strength and stiffness values have been proposed for these claddings as they are used at present.

An innovative method for developing the stiffness matrix for the lateral load resistant elements in medium-rise and high-rise buildings is also introduced.
