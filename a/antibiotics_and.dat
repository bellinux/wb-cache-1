5|$|Chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems also exist, some {{of which}} perform cell {{functions}} such as responding to stresses, causing cell cycle arrest and bringing about programmed cell death. In evolutionary terms, toxin-antitoxin systems can be considered selfish DNA in {{that the purpose of}} the systems are to replicate, regardless of whether they benefit the host organism or not. Some have proposed adaptive theories to explain the evolution of toxin-antitoxin systems; for example, chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems could have evolved to prevent the inheritance of large deletions of the host genome. Toxin-antitoxin systems have several biotechnological applications, such as a method of maintaining plasmids in cell lines, targets for <b>antibiotics,</b> <b>and</b> as positive selection vectors.|$|E
5|$|In the past, Native Americans ate {{the flesh}} of {{horseshoe}} crabs, and used the tail spines as spear tips and the shells to bail water out of their canoes. More recent attempts to use horseshoe crabs as food for livestock were abandoned when {{it was found that}} this gave the meat a bad taste. Horseshoe crab blood contains a clotting agent, limulus amebocyte lysate, which is used to test <b>antibiotics</b> <b>and</b> kidney machines to ensure that they are free of dangerous bacteria, and to detect spinal meningitis and some cancers.|$|E
5|$|Many human {{diseases}} are not static phenomena, but capable of evolution. Viruses, bacteria, fungi and cancers evolve to be resistant to host immune defences, {{as well as}} pharmaceutical drugs. These same problems occur in agriculture with pesticide and herbicide resistance. It is possible that we are facing {{the end of the}} effective life of most of available <b>antibiotics</b> <b>and</b> predicting the evolution and evolvability of our pathogens and devising strategies to slow or circumvent it is requiring deeper knowledge of the complex forces driving evolution at the molecular level.|$|E

40|$|Streptomyces lactamdurans, {{producer}} of the antibiotic cephamycin C, excretes at least two proteases. Physiological studies indicate that <b>antibiotic</b> synthesis <b>and</b> serine protease formation are coordinately regulated. Both are produced only after culture growth ends, and they appear with essentially identical kinetics. In addition, strains which produce superior levels of cephamycin C form equally superior levels of the serine protease. Genetic evidence reveals that the syntheses of the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>and</b> serine proteases are associated with sporulation. Mutants which fail to produce aerial hyphae (bald mutants) also fail to synthesize the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>and</b> serine proteases...|$|R
5|$|Many {{treatment}} options for acne are available, including lifestyle changes, medications, and medical procedures. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may help. Treatments applied {{directly to the}} affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, are commonly used. <b>Antibiotics</b> <b>and</b> retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth {{for the treatment of}} acne. However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Several types of birth control pills help against acne in women. Isotretinoin pills are usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects. Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall long-term impact to individuals.|$|E
5|$|Penicillin {{has been}} {{suggested}} as the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} S.iniae infection in mammals, including humans. In the 1995–1996 cluster of human cases, all clinical s were susceptible to penicillin, several cephalosporins, clindamycin, erythromycin, and co-trimoxazole (MICs 0.25µg/ml); all nine patients were treated with parenteral beta-lactam <b>antibiotics</b> <b>and</b> recovered uneventfully. A study of isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2000 and 2004 found all to be sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, and vancomycin.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} {{applied to the}} skin or taken orally to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of antibiotics for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective, especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical erythromycin. Commonly used antibiotics, either applied to the skin or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline. When antibiotics are applied to the skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical <b>antibiotics,</b> <b>and</b> produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use together.|$|E
40|$|Bacteriophage {{infection}} <b>and</b> <b>antibiotics</b> used individually {{to reduce}} biofilm mass often {{result in the}} emergence of significant levels of phage <b>and</b> <b>antibiotic</b> resistant cells. In contrast, combination therapy in Escherichia coli biofilms employing T 4 phage and tobramycin resulted in greater than 99 % and 39 % reduction in <b>antibiotic</b> <b>and</b> phage resistant cells, respectively. In P. aeruginosa biofilms, combination therapy resulted in a 60 % and 99 % reduction in <b>antibiotic</b> <b>and</b> PB- 1 phage resistant cells, respectively. Although the combined treatment resulted in greater reduction of E. coli CFUs compared to the use of antibiotic alone, infection of P. aeruginosa biofilms with PB- 1 in the presence of tobramycin was only as effective in the reduction of CFUs as the use of antibiotic alone. The study demonstrated phage infection in combination with tobramycin can significantly reduce the emergence of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>and</b> phage resistant cells in both E. coli and P. aeruginosa biofilms, however, a reduction in biomass was dependent on the phage-host system...|$|R

5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of <b>antibiotics</b> <b>and</b> each class inhibits {{a process that is}} different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is a {{completely}} synthetic drug: it does not occur in nature (unlike erythromycin and many other <b>antibiotics)</b> <b>and</b> was not developed by building upon a naturally occurring skeleton (unlike most beta-lactams, which are semisynthetic). Many approaches are available for oxazolidinone synthesis, and several routes for the synthesis of linezolid {{have been reported in}} the chemistry literature. Despite good yields, the original method (developed by Upjohn for pilot plant-scale production of linezolid and eperezolid) is lengthy, requires the use of expensive chemicals—such as palladium on carbon and the highly sensitive reagents methanesulfonyl chloride and n-butyllithium—and needs low-temperature conditions. Much of the high cost of linezolid has been attributed to the expense of its synthesis. A somewhat more concise and cost-effective route better suited to large-scale production was patented by Upjohn in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Most beekeepers {{affected}} by CCD {{report that they}} use <b>antibiotics</b> <b>and</b> miticides in their colonies, though the lack of uniformity as to which particular chemicals they use makes it unlikely that any single such chemical is involved. However, {{it is possible that}} not all such chemicals in use have been tested for possible effects on honey bees, and could therefore potentially be contributing to the CCD phenomenon. Beekeepers use miticides to rid colonies of Varroa infestations; however, treatment can lead to higher levels of viral infections in colonies. High doses of treatment or the use of miticides {{for an extended period of}} time can lead to immune-suppression in honey bees, making them more susceptible to viruses. A widespread occurrence of viral infections within a beehive can lead to colony collapse. Although miticides are not a direct cause of CCD they do play a role in it.|$|E

5|$|The ear drum {{may become}} {{perforated}} {{in the event}} of a large sound or explosion, when diving or flying (called barotrauma), or by objects inserted into the ear. Another common cause of injury is due to an infection such as otitis media. These may cause a discharge from the ear called otorrhea, and are often investigated by otoscopy and audiometry. Treatment may include watchful waiting, <b>antibiotics</b> <b>and</b> possibly surgery, if the injury is prolonged or the position of the ossicles is affected. Skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing the ear structures (the temporal bone) can also cause damage to the middle ear. A cholesteatoma is a cyst of squamous skin cells that may develop from birth or secondary to other causes such as chronic ear infections. It may impair hearing or cause dizziness or vertigo, and is usually investigated by otoscopy and may require a CT scan. The treatment for cholesteatoma is surgery.|$|E
5|$|The {{largest number}} {{exist in the}} gut flora, {{and a large number}} on the skin. The vast {{majority}} of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system, though many are beneficial particularly in the gut flora. However several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, and bubonic plague. The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections, with tuberculosis alone killing about 2 million people per year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. In developed countries, antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming, making antibiotic resistance a growing problem. In industry, bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills, the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation, and the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector, as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of <b>antibiotics</b> <b>and</b> other chemicals.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} types of canine ear infections {{are caused by}} microorganisms, {{including}} yeast and bacterial infections. The most common variety of this is Malassezia pachydermatitis. Symptoms can include the dog shaking its head or scratching at its ears more frequently. The ear canal will appear inflamed, a pus-like substance will be discharged in some cases, and the ear will smell quite pungent in most cases. Treatment for the more common causes of otitis externa in dogs often includes oral <b>antibiotics</b> <b>and</b> flushing the ears with an antibacterial solution. In some cases, anti-inflammatory medication is prescribed. Some conditions can increase the chance of ear infections, including living in a humid environment and frequent swimming or bathing without adequate drying of the ear afterwards. Keeping {{the hair on the}} ears short {{can be used as a}} preventative method to ear problems.|$|E

40|$|A {{study on}} the use of zinc {{bacitracin}} <b>antibiotic</b> (ZnB) <b>and</b> Morinda citrifolia waste as feed additive in layer ration was conducted. One hundred and twenty pullet of Isa Brown strain were allocated into 5 treatments with 6 replications with 4 birds/replication. The treatment were: control, control + antibiotic (50 ppm Zinc bacitracin) and control + M. citrifolia waste at 3 levels (5, 10 and 15 g/kg ration). Analysis of variance was conducted in a completely randomized design. Variables measured were: feed intake, hen day (% HD), egg weight and feed conversion ratio (FCR). The results showed that feed intake of hens with M. citrifolia waste 5 g/kg for 6 month was significantly (P 0. 05). The percentage of HD with <b>antibiotic</b> <b>and</b> M. citrifolia waste did not significantly (P> 0. 05) differ, but tent to be higher than that of the control. Egg weight with M. citrifolia waste 5 g/kg was significantly (P 0. 05). differ. FCR with <b>antibiotic</b> <b>and</b> M. citrifolia waste 5 g/kg was significantly lower than that of control. Between <b>antibiotic</b> <b>and</b> M. citrifolia waste was not significantly different (P< 0. 05), but FCR with <b>antibiotic</b> <b>and</b> M. citrifolia waste 5 g/kg tent to be lower than that of M. citrifolia waste 10 and 15 g/kg. It is concluded that the use of M. citrifolia waste 5 g/kg can substituted antibiotic in layer ration...|$|R

Neoengleromycin has an unusual chemical structure featuring a rare amine-substituted hydroxamic acid skeleton.|$|R
5|$|Abundant worldwide, most fungi are {{inconspicuous}} {{because of}} the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. Fungi include symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of human food, in the form of mushrooms and truffles; as a leavening agent for bread; and in the fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and soy sauce. Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of <b>antibiotics,</b> <b>and,</b> more recently, various enzymes produced by fungi are used industrially and in detergents. Fungi are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and polyketides, that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., rice blast disease) or food spoilage can have a large impact on human food supplies and local economies.|$|E
