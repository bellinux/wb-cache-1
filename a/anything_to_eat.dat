500|$|While the {{definition}} of seabirds suggests that the birds in question spend {{their lives on the}} ocean, many seabird families have many species that spend some or even most of their lives inland away from the sea. Most strikingly, many species breed tens, hundreds or even thousands of miles inland. Some of these species still return to the ocean to feed; for example, the snow petrel, the nests of which have been found [...] inland on the Antarctic mainland, are unlikely to find <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> around their breeding sites. The marbled murrelet nests inland in old growth forest, seeking huge conifers with large branches to nest on. Other species, such as the California gull, nest and feed inland on lakes, and then move to the coasts in the winter. Some cormorant, pelican, gull and tern species have individuals that never visit the sea at all, spending their lives on lakes, rivers, swamps and, in the case of some of the gulls, cities and agricultural land. In these cases it is thought that these terrestrial or freshwater birds evolved from marine ancestors. Some seabirds, principally those that nest in tundra, as skuas and phalaropes do, will migrate over land as well.|$|E

2500|$|Despite confessions from Autry, Austin, and Dylan Adams, all men {{arrested for}} the crime have vehemently denied {{involvement}} in the disappearance at some point and have accused the state of coercive tactics. Early in the case, Autry claimed that investigators {{tried to get him}} to testify falsely against Zach Adams. The family of Dylan Adams, who is mentally disabled, claimed that [...] "hey kept him up all night, would not give him <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> or drink and finally he said, 'What do you want me to say?

2500|$|Hobhouse {{arrived at}} the camp at Bloemfontein on 24 January 1901 and {{was shocked by the}} {{conditions}} she encountered:"They went to sleep without any provision having been made for them and without <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> or to drink. I saw crowds of them along railway lines in bitterly cold weather, in pouring rain–hungry, sick, dying and dead. Soap was not dispensed. The water supply was inadequate. No bedstead or mattress was procurable. Fuel was scarce and had to be collected from the green bushes on the opes of the kopjes (small hills) by the people themselves. The rations were extremely meagre and when, as I frequently experienced, the actual quantity dispensed fell short of the amount prescribed, it simply meant famine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Duncan Hines, an American entrepreneur, often enjoyed ham {{and eggs}} as a supper meal. He {{said that people}} should choose ham and eggs as a meal at a diner when {{uncertain}} about what to order, because cooks cannot [...] "disguise a bad egg nor spoil a slice of good ham." [...] According to his own account, on one occasion in 1899, Hines ordered five dollars' worth of ham and eggs at Harry Hynd's Restaurant in Cheyenne, Wyoming, a very large amount of food (according to U.S. government statistics, $5 in 1899 {{was the equivalent of}} $143.60 in 2015 dollars). Hines had had hardly <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> for four days, having had to walk about [...] to Cheyenne after his horse gave out. About two miles into his hike, he had been given a few scraps of food by a hermit, after which he continued to Cheyenne, with five inches of snow on the ground. The counter person initially refused the order, saying that {{it would be impossible to}} finish it, but Hines was eventually provided with a large platter of ham and eggs and ate it all. Years later he wrote that nothing else had tasted as good as that platter of ham and eggs at that time.|$|E
2500|$|Robin Hood disguises {{himself as}} a friar in the forest and {{encounters}} two [...] "lusty" [...] priests on horseback (4.4). He begs the priests for a silver groat, saying he hasn't {{been able to get}} <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> or drink all day. The priests explain that they have no money because they have been robbed that morning. Robin tells them he thinks they're lying, and at that they speed away on their horses, but Robin soon catches up with them. He pulls them off of their horses, whereupon the priests fall on their knees and promise to pray for money. After they've prayed for an hour, Robin says they will all search themselves for the money heaven has given them. The priests pretend to search themselves and still find no money, but when Robin searches them he finds five hundred pieces of gold, which he lays out on the ground. He gives them each fifty pounds for praying so earnestly and keeps the rest for himself. Relieved to get away physically unharmed, the priests rise from their knees to go, but Robin commands them to stay until they have taken three oaths by the forest's [...] "holy grass": that they never again will lie, that they will never try to persuade maidens to sin or lie with other men's wives, and that they will be charitable to the poor (21.3). The priests go on their way and Robin returns to the forest.|$|E

2500|$|Blue Horse {{invariably}} dined with Burbank at {{noon and}} {{always had a}} good appetite. One day, after dinner, Burbank said to Blue Horse: [...] "I notice that you always eat everything in front of you, but you never pass your plate back the second time or ask for another cup of coffee. Why is that? Is it because you cannot eat any more or drink any more coffee. O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents you paid for my dinner was for just what was placed before me. No, I said, the twenty-five cents pays for all you can eat. Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men sitting at his table left <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> on their plates before them, {{that it would be}} all right for him to gather it up and take it home for his wife and children. It is needless to say that all the Sioux Indians who patronized that hotel afterward got all that was coming to them.” One time Blue Horse was in the Indian trader's store with his little niece, who saw something on the shelves that she very much wanted. Blue Horse had no money, so he took off his old moccasins and gave them to the Indian trader in exchange for what the little girl craved and he walked home barefooted.|$|E
2500|$|The year {{spent in}} Detroit was a {{difficult}} time for Kahlo. Although she had enjoyed visiting San Francisco and New York City, she disliked aspects of American society, which she regarded as colonialist, {{as well as most}} Americans, whom she found [...] "boring". She disliked having to socialize with capitalists such as Henry and Edsel Ford, and was angered that many of the hotels in Detroit refused to accept Jewish guests. In a letter to a friend, she wrote that [...] "although I am very interested in all the industrial and mechanical development of the United States", she felt [...] "a bit of a rage against all the rich guys here, since I have seen thousands of people in the most terrible misery without <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> and with no place to sleep, that is what has most impressed me here, it is terrifying to see the rich having parties day and night whiles thousands and thousands of people are dying of hunger." [...] Kahlo's time in Detroit was also complicated by a pregnancy. Her doctor agreed to perform an abortion, but the medication used was ineffective. Kahlo was deeply ambivalent about having a child and had already undergone an abortion earlier in the marriage. Following the failed abortion, she reluctantly agreed to continue with the pregnancy, but miscarried in July, which caused a serious hemorrhage that required her being hospitalized for two weeks. Less than three months later, her mother died from complications of surgery in Mexico.|$|E
