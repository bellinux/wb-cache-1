5|$|The GHMix2.0 mode {{allows one}} to {{precisely}} create songs up to 10 min, and includes pre-defined sample tracks that can be modified on a note-by-note basis as desired. The new Jam mode lets the players select one of several standard pre-set rhythms and then play along with it on the instrument controllers in a free-form mode; however, players can then capture any segment of this music and move it to the Mix mode to compile a song. User songs are then uploaded and downloaded through the GHTunes mode of the Music Studio. While songs that violate copyright will still {{be removed from the}} service, Neversoft will be less aggressive <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> will rely more on user feedback on such issues.

5|$|As Coach begins putting {{together}} his new Lion team, he realizes he's in {{for more than}} he bargained for. The players who try out are less than desirable, but Coach gets a lucky break {{with a couple of}} new faces. The first is Vince Howard (Michael B. Jordan), a student who has gotten {{in trouble with the law}} too many times. He is given one last chance if he plays football for the East Dillon Lions. Although he has no prior football experience, he has natural talent and becomes the team's first star quarterback. The second break comes to the Lions when Buddy Garrity reveals to Eric that the address on file for the Panthers new prodigy running back, Luke Cafferty, is nothing more than a mailbox in front of an empty lot, and Luke is really zoned for East Dillon. Tami is faced with a struggle as the principal of West Dillon. A new character on the show, Becky, is introduced when Tim Riggins rents a trailer on her mother's property.

Thereafter, it is revealed that Sloan is in a comatose state, and will be taken off of life support that evening. In the hospital cafeteria, Meredith Grey announces that Wilson will be given the honor of performing a supervised appendectomy, a procedure historically used {{as a reward for}} interns. The hospital's chief of surgery, Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), introduces the new pediatric surgery attending, Dr. Mel Barnett (Philip Casnoff), to Torres and Karev. Barnett informs Karev that he will not be continuing with the African orphan charity program (a function to treat ill children from Third World countries), something that was initially finalized by the latter and former chief of pediatric surgery, Robbins. Karev becomes upset <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> asks Torres to prevent Barnett from discontinuing the program, though Torres shows no interest in helping Karev.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Coke {{returned}} to Britain, plans were {{already under way}} for him to enter Parliament. When an election was called in 1774, Wenman stood for the seat of Norfolk, with his son asked to stand in his place for Derby. Coke was not particularly enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> withdrew when his opponent discovered he was under 21, the requisite age to stand for Parliament. With his father elected, Coke travelled with him to London, meeting members of the British high society. His sister Elizabeth and her husband James Dutton were also visiting, with Dutton's sister Jane, and Coke fell in love with her. Wenman was not impressed when Coke asked him to let them be married, as he had picked out the daughter of a baronet for his son, but with the intercession of Wenman's friend Harbord Harbord, he finally consented to their marriage, which occurred on 5 October 1775.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{begins to}} insult Lois about her {{advancing}} age, including her minor strands of gray hair. This makes her extremely self-conscious, and soon Lois {{becomes aware of}} her lust for a younger man. After introducing her new boyfriend, Anthony, to the family, Meg goes on to make out {{with him on the}} family couch, with Lois watching over nearby. Jealous of her daughter's new-found love, she begins hitting on Anthony. Later that day, Lois sends Meg to pick up her grandfather, leaving her all alone with Anthony. The two then begin making out on the couch, but Meg returns to the house only a few moments later and discovers them. Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> he admits that he was actually embarrassed about his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she could be with a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.|$|E

5|$|On his {{way back}} to home to join Sastry for a concert, Suryam helps a few victims of an {{accidental}} fire in Ramapuram. His absence leaves Sastry livid and he refuses to listen to any excuses. Sastry comes across Suryam and Lalitha as a couple, which widens the gap between them. While Gayathri is apprehensive, Udayam remains unaffected. On the way to another concert, Sastry refuses to help an injured lineman named Narayana. A disturbed Suryam emphasises that society's welfare is more important than worshipping music, which makes Sastry declare Charukesa his successor as a musician. Suryam confronts Sastry <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> leaves the house for good after an argument. Suryam meets Varalayya and stays in his client's house. Suryam later meets Narayana's widow and learns that the government has denied him compensation as he was drunk during working hours. He also meets the family of another drunkard named Kishtappa, one of the survivors of the fire. Their situation leaves Suryam disturbed, and he vows to abolish liquor in Ramapuram. Suryam and Lalitha begin their attempts to make the working class men abandon liquor consumption. Although initially successful, the plan backfires later.|$|E
5|$|Seetharamudu was a {{barrister}} {{who returned}} from London upon his father's death to manage his family businesses. He was a zamindar and {{was fond of}} cars. In one such instance, he sees a poor farmer called Ramalakshmi and decides to marry her. Asked by a mediator, she accepts the proposal, without meeting Seetharamudu, but asks him for six months' delay as she has to buy new clothes for the bridegroom, following the village's tradition. Seetharamudu learns <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> meets her as a reformed thief. With his help, Ramalakshmi could cultivate enough grain in three months and buy new clothes with that money. On the day of marriage, she is surprised to know that Seetharamudu is her chosen groom and they marry. On 14 February 1924 the couple goes out, but Chaitanya, suffering from fever then, fakes a stomach ache so that his parents return. The plan works and the couple rush home at high speed but die in an accident at 10:20 AM near the same clock tower where Radha Mohan and Krishna Veni would die. Now he aims to reunite them without letting them recollect their past as they cannot bear the pain of losing him.|$|E
5|$|Several {{plans were}} introduced, {{with the most}} {{important}} plan being that of James Madison (the Virginia Plan). The Convention's work was mostly a matter of modifying this plan. Charles Pinckney also introduced a plan, although this wasn't considered and its exact character has been lost to history. After the Convention was well under way, the New Jersey Plan was introduced though never seriously considered. It was mainly a protest to what some delegates thought was the excessively radical change from the Articles of Confederation. Alexander Hamilton also offered a plan after the Convention was well under way, though it included an executive serving for life and therefore the delegates felt it too closely resembled a monarchy. Historians are unsure how serious he was <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> some have speculated {{that he may have}} done it to make Madison's plan look moderate by comparison. The Connecticut Compromise wasn't a plan but one of several compromises offered by the Connecticut delegation. It was key to the ultimate ratification of the constitution, but was only included after being modified by Benjamin Franklin {{in order to make it}} more appealing to larger states.|$|E
