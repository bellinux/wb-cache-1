It is important to prepare the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>kits</b> for detection of liver cancer early, simply and inexpensively in this country. Detection of the marker in human sera would signifi cantly help successful therapy, since the tumor could be tackled at an early stage in its development, often before metastases and other consequences. Therefore, level of AFP in sera would give possibility to control the progression of liver cancer. The micro titer plates were prepared for AFP ELISA <b>diagnostic</b> <b>kits,</b> and their sensitivity and specifi city were 94. 4...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: A fluorogenic peptide probe-immobilized <b>diagnostic</b> <b>kit</b> {{was used}} to analyze MMP {{activity}} in the synovial fluids (SFs) from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and acute inflammatory conditions of the knee joint. Methods: The MMP <b>diagnostic</b> <b>kit</b> containing a polymer-conjugated MMP probe immobilized on a 96 -well plate was utilized for high-throughput screening of MMP activity in SFs from OA patients (n = 33) and patients with acute inflammatory conditions of the knee joint (n = 5). Results: Compared to SF from OA patients, SF from patients with acute inflammatory conditions of the knee joint presented stronger NIR fluorescent signals. In gelatin zymography, most samples from patients with acute inflammatory conditions of the knee joint also displayed 92 kDa (pro-form) MMP- 9 and faint 84 kDa (active form) MMP- 9, while SF from OA patients did not display detectable MMP- 9 activity. Conclusion: The presence of a strong fluorescence signal from the MMP <b>diagnostic</b> <b>kit</b> corresponded well with patients with acute inflammatory conditions of the knee joint. The results suggest that our MMP <b>diagnostic</b> <b>kit</b> {{can be useful in}} differentiation between early stages of OA and acute inflammatory conditions of the knee joint. </p...|$|R
