25|$|In 1917 Lethbridge {{took a job}} as a {{nurse at}} Bradford Hospital where she tended troops who had been injured and maimed in the War. Returning to London she applied to work at the National Munitions Filling Factory in Hayes, Middlesex lying about her age since she should have been barred had it been known she was under {{eighteen}} years. She volunteered for the dangerous work of filling shells with <b>Amatol</b> explosive. On 23 October she was working on a recently condemned machine that packed the <b>Amatol</b> into the shells. It exploded killing several workers and seriously injuring Lethbridge whose left leg was blown off. Although temporarily blinded she managed to apply a tourniquet to her thigh, an act that certainly saved her life.|$|E
25|$|The {{bomb was}} {{fitted with a}} single {{transverse}} fuze pocket. The bomb was usually filled {{with a mixture of}} 40% <b>amatol</b> and 60% TNT, but when used as an anti-shipping bomb it was filled with Trialen 105, a mixture of 15% RDX, 70% TNT and 15% aluminium powder. A central exploder tube of high grade TNT was put down the centre of the explosive to ensure high order detonation.|$|E
50|$|One area {{in which}} oxygen balance can be applied is in the {{processing}} of mixtures of explosives. The family of explosives called <b>amatols</b> are mixtures of ammonium nitrate and TNT. Ammonium nitrate has an oxygen balance of +20% and TNT has an oxygen balance of −74%, so {{it would appear that}} the mixture yielding an oxygen balance of zero would also result in the best explosive properties. In actual practice a mixture of 80% ammonium nitrate and 20% TNT by weight yields an oxygen balance of +1%, the best properties of all mixtures, and an increase in strength of 30% over TNT.|$|R
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Freeth was in the Territorial Army, having joined in 1912, and spent six weeks in the trenches in France with the Cheshire Regiment as a major in early 1915, but was then sent back to Britain to continue his armaments research at Brunner Mond {{at the direction of}} Lord Moulton. Germany, {{at the start of the}} war, had an advantage over Britain in their ability to manufacture explosives inexpensively: they had pioneered mixing ammonium nitrate and TNT to create <b>amatol,</b> which was similar to pure TNT in effectiveness, and understood the Haber-Bosch process and applied it in plants to produce the necessary nitrogen compounds.|$|E

2500|$|The United Kingdom's {{intention}} in World War II {{was to use}} [...] "desensitised" [...] RDX. In {{the original}} Woolwich process, RDX was phlegmatized with beeswax, but later paraffin wax was used, {{based on the work}} carried out at Bruceton. In the event the UK was unable to obtain sufficient RDX to meet its needs, some of the shortfall was met by substituting <b>amatol,</b> a mixture of ammonium nitrate and TNT.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reaction}} is exothermic {{but has a}} high activation energy in the gas phase (~62 kcal/mol). The condensed phases (solid or liquid) show markedly lower activation energies of roughly 35 kcal/mol due to unique bimolecular decomposition routes at elevated densities. [...] Because of the production of carbon, TNT explosions have a sooty appearance. [...] Because TNT has an excess of carbon, explosive mixtures with oxygen-rich compounds can yield more energy per kilogram than TNT alone. [...] During the 20th century, <b>amatol,</b> a mixture of TNT with ammonium nitrate was a widely used military explosive.|$|E
2500|$|In 1943, {{production}} of the V-2 rocket began in Germany. It had an operational range of [...] and carried a [...] warhead, with an <b>amatol</b> explosive charge. It normally achieved an operational maximum altitude of around , but could achieve [...] if launched vertically. The vehicle was similar to most modern rockets, with turbopumps, inertial guidance and many other features. Thousands were fired at various Allied nations, mainly Belgium, as well as England and France. While {{they could not be}} intercepted, their guidance system design and single conventional warhead meant that it was insufficiently accurate against military targets. A total of 2,754 people in England were killed, and 6,523 were wounded before the launch campaign was ended. There were also 20,000 deaths of slave labour during the construction of V-2s. While it did not significantly affect the course of the war, the V-2 provided a lethal demonstration of the potential for guided rockets as weapons.|$|E
2500|$|Japanese bombings, {{destruction}} by retreating American troops, deprivations by bandit [...] "guerrilla" [...] bands, and hoarding by civilians {{had significantly}} reduced available war supplies, {{as well as}} those items necessary to run an effective government. Fertig used his engineering skills and the skills of other escaped Americans and resisting Filipinos to create many supplies from scratch. For example, tuba was brewed from coconut palms to provide alcohol to fuel gasoline vehicles, batteries were recharged by soaking them in tuba, soda bottles and fence wire were used to create a telegraph to enhance communications, curtain rods were cut into pieces and shaped to provide ammunition for [...]30 caliber rifles, steel was shaved from automobile springs and curled to make recoiling springs for rifles, money was printed in both English and the local language using wooden blocks, and fisherman towed Japanese mines ashore to secure the explosive <b>amatol</b> so it could be used to make gunpowder. Soap was made from coconut oil and wood ashes. Then the soap was traded for sugar which was then used to make alcohol for fuel.|$|E
2500|$|The {{attempt to}} sink three old cruisers, {{to block the}} flow of traffic {{in and out of}} the Port of Bruges-Zeebrugge failed. The failure of the attack on the Zeebrugge mole {{resulted}} in the Germans concentrating their fire on the three blocking ships, , [...] and , which were filled with concrete. Thetis did not make it to the canal entrance, after it hit an obstruction and was scuttled prematurely. The two other ships were sunk at the narrowest point of the canal. The submarines C1 under Lieut. A.C Newbold and C3 under Lieut. R.D. Sandford were old, each with a volunteer crew of one other officer and four ratings. They had five tons of <b>amatol</b> packed into their fore-ends and were to be driven into the viaduct and then blown up, to prevent reinforcement of the German garrison on the mole. The crews were to abandon their submarines shortly before the collision with the viaduct, leaving the submarines to steer themselves automatically. During the passage from Dover, C1 parted with its tow and arrived too late to take part in the operation. Sandford, commanding C3, elected to steer his ship into the viaduct manually instead of depending on the automatic system.|$|E
5000|$|The {{explosive}} charges {{hidden in}} HMS Campbeltown during the St. Nazaire Raid of 1942 contained <b>amatol.</b> The British X class midget submarines which planted explosive charges beneath the German battleship Tirpitz in September 1943 carried two [...] "saddle charges" [...] containing four tons of <b>amatol.</b> Warheads for the German V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rockets also contained <b>amatol.</b>|$|E
50|$|The colour of <b>amatol</b> {{ranges from}} off-white to {{slightly}} yellow or pinkish brown, {{depending on the}} mixture used and remains soft {{for long periods of}} storage. It is also hygroscopic, which complicates long-term storage. To prevent moisture problems, <b>amatol</b> charges were coated with a thin layer of pure molten TNT or alternatively bitumen. Long-term storage was rare during wars because munitions charged with <b>amatol</b> were generally used soon after manufacture.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Amatol</b> {{exploits}} synergy between TNT and ammonium nitrate. TNT has higher explosive {{velocity and}} brisance, but is deficient in oxygen. Oxygen deficiency causes black smoke residue from a pure TNT explosion. The oxygen surplus of ammonium nitrate increases the energy release of TNT during detonation. Depending on {{the ratio of}} ingredients used, <b>amatol</b> leaves a residue of white or grey smoke after detonation. <b>Amatol</b> has a lower explosive velocity and correspondingly lower brisance than TNT but is cheaper because of the lower cost of ammonium nitrate.|$|E

50|$|Relatively unsophisticated cannery {{equipment}} can {{be adapted}} to <b>amatol</b> production. TNT is gently heated with steam or hot water until it melts, acquiring the physical characteristics of a syrup. Then the correct weight ratio of powdered ammonium nitrate is added and mixed in. Whilst this mixture is still in a molten state, it is poured into empty bomb casings and allowed to cool and solidify. However, the lowest grades of <b>amatol</b> could not be produced by casting molten TNT. Instead, flaked TNT was thoroughly mixed with powdered ammonium nitrate and then compressed or extruded.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Amatol</b> is {{a highly}} {{explosive}} material made from a mixture of TNT and ammonium nitrate. The British name originates from the words ammonium and toluene (a raw material of TNT). Similar mixtures (1 part dinitronaphthalene and 7 parts ammonium nitrate) were known as Schneiderite in France. <b>Amatol</b> was used extensively during World War I and World War II, typically as an explosive in military weapons such as aircraft bombs, shells, depth charges, and naval mines. [...] It was eventually replaced with alternative explosives such as composition B, torpex, and tritonal.|$|E
5000|$|TNT is 50% {{deficient}} in oxygen. <b>Amatol</b> is oxygen balanced {{and is therefore}} more effective than pure TNT when exploding underground or underwater. RDX also has a negative oxygen balance.|$|E
