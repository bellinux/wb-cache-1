5|$|Suqami's {{passport}} {{survived the}} crash {{and landed in}} the street below. Soaked in jet fuel, it {{was picked up by}} a passerby who gave it to a New York City Police Department (NYPD) detective shortly before the South Tower collapsed. Investigators retrieved Mohamed Atta's luggage, which had not been loaded onto the flight. In it they found Omari's passport and driver's license, a videocassette for a Boeing757 flight simulator, a folding knife, and pepper spray. In a recording, a few months later in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, took responsibility for the attack. The <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Trade Center exceeded even bin Laden's expectations: he had expected only the floors above the plane strikes to collapse. The flight recorders for Flight11 and Flight175 were never found.|$|E
5|$|The Apostles of the Stars launch {{their first}} <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Summit, killing the leaders from 20 top nations, causing Chronos {{to declare war}} on them. Chronos even notify Train of a new Sweeper bounty on Creed {{in order to gain}} his help, though he resists, {{planning}} to go after him on his own terms. Chronos assassin Jenos Hazard is sent to hire Rinslet to gather information on the Apostles, however, this is really in order to use her as bait to lure Creed out of hiding and force Train to get involved, who was lured to the same area via false Sweeper intel. Jenos and the other two members of the special unit Cerebus launch an assault on Creed's lair, that results in it being turned to rubble, while Train simply rescues Rinslet and leaves. Creed then tries to kill Sven, believing he is holding Train back from joining him, but accidentally shoots Train with a nanomachine-enhanced bullet that has the unplanned effect of reverting his body to that of a child. In order to return Train to normal, Train, Sven and Eve visit nanotechnology expert Dr. Tearju, who is also Eve's creator. While there, the Apostles of the Stars attack to force Tearju to join them in order to grant Creed eternal life through nanomachines, but are defeated by a returned Train who can now fire a railgun shot thanks to the nanomachines. However, Eathes was able to copy Tearju, gaining all of her knowledge, and Train, Sven and Eve finally decide {{to put a stop to}} Creed.|$|E

25|$|New York's {{population}} {{reached an}} all-time high in the 2000 census; according to census estimates since 2000, the city has continued to grow, including rapid growth in the most urbanized borough, Manhattan. During this period, New York City was a site of the September 11 attacks of 2001; 2,606 {{people who were in}} the towers and in the surrounding area were killed by a terrorist <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Trade Center, an event considered highly traumatic for the city but which did not stop the city's rapid regrowth. On November 3, 2014, One World Trade Center opened {{on the site of the}} attack. Hurricane Sandy brought a destructive storm surge to New York City on the evening of October 29, 2012, flooding numerous streets, tunnels, and subway lines in Lower Manhattan. It flooded low-lying areas of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Electrical power was lost in many parts of the city and its suburbs.|$|E
25|$|One waiver for beards {{has been}} granted to Army Reserve Chaplain (Rabbi) Jacob Goldstein (originally granted when {{he served as}} a {{chaplain}} for the New York Army National Guard and continued after his transfer to the United States Army Reserve), who has served since 1977 on deployments to areas including Bosnia, South Korea, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He also served {{on the staff of the}} United States Army Chief of Chaplains, and after the Sept. 11, 2001 <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Trade Center, he served for five months as the senior chaplain for all military branches at Ground Zero. He was the only Jewish chaplain in Grenada in 1983, and during a two-month deployment to Iraq in 2003, he helped set up a sukkah (a religious requirement for the Jewish festival of Sukkot), in Saddam Hussein’s palace. Goldstein served with the National Guard, wearing the beard as a result of the waiver he received until he reached mandatory retirement age, when the U.S. Army Reserve approved his application to serve as a reserve chaplain, agreeing to retain the waiver.|$|E

25|$|Clinically, {{the most}} serious and {{immediate}} complication is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which usually occurs within 24 h. Those with significant lower airway involvement may develop bacterial infection. Importantly, victims suffering body surface burn and smoke inhalation are the most susceptible. Thermal injury combined with inhalation injury compromises pulmonary function, producing microvascular hyperpermeability {{that leads to a}} significant increase in lung lymph flow and pulmonary edema. The terrorist <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Trade Center on September 11, 2001 left many people with impaired lung function. A study of firefighters and EMS workers enrolled in the FDNY WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program, whose lung function was tested prior to 9/11, documented a steep decline in lung function in the first year after 9/11. A new study that includes a thousand additional workers shows that the declines have persisted over time. Prior to 9/11, 3% of firefighters had below-normal lung function, one year after 9/11 nearly 19% did, and six years later it stabilized at 13%. Ten to 14 days after acute exposure to some agents (e.g. ammonia, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury), some patients develop bronchiolitis obliterans progressing to ARDS. Bronchiolitis obliterans with organized pneumonia can ensue when granulation tissue accumulates in the terminal airways and alveolar ducts during the body's reparative process. A minority of these patients develop late pulmonary fibrosis. Also at enhanced risk are persons with co-morbidities. Several studies report that both aged persons and smokers are especially vulnerable to the adverse effects of inhalation injury.|$|E

The blast resulted in a [...] hole through five sublevels. The greatest damage was on levels B1 and B2, with significant structural damage on level B3. Six people were killed, {{and more than a}} thousand were injured, as 50,000 workers and visitors were inside the tower at the time. Many people inside the North Tower were forced to walk down darkened stairwells that had no emergency lighting, and some took two hours or more to reach safety.|$|E
500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Na'vi habitat Hometree reminded commentators of the September 11 <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Trade Center, one calling it a [...] "tacky metaphor" [...] and others criticizing Cameron for his [...] "audacious willingness to question the sacred trauma of 9/11". Cameron {{said that he was}} [...] "surprised at how much it did look like September 11", but added that he did not think that it was necessarily a bad thing. A French critic wrote: [...] "How can one not see the analogy {{with the collapse of the}} towers of the World Trade Center? [...] Then, after that spectacular scene, all is justified [...] indigenous peoples (the allied forces)... to kill those who [...] just like terrorists." [...] Another writer noted that [...] "the U.S.' stand-ins are the perpetrators, and not the victims" [...] and described this reversal as [...] "the movie’s most seditious act".|$|E

500|$|Savage sued CAIR for {{copyright}} infringement {{for using}} excerpts from his show on CAIR's website. The suit alleged that CAIR's repackaging of Savage's comments was [...] "deliberately designed {{to obscure the}} specific message conveyed by Michael Savage". The excerpts included Savage's characterization of the Qur'an as [...] "a throwback document" [...] and a [...] "book of hate". CAIR called the suit [...] "bizarre, sloppy and baseless". On July 25, 2008, the United States district court dismissed Savage's suit against CAIR, holding that the posting of the audio clip was protected under the First Amendment doctrine of fair use, as {{it was used to}} [...] "comment on and rebut derogatory statements regarding their organization and their religious affiliations." [...] The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects in his suit. That amended complaint alleged that CAIR was a RICO conspirator in support of terror, including the 9/11 terror <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Trade Center. Permission was granted to allow that filing but on August 14, 2008, however, Savage's lawyer, Daniel Horowitz, announced that Savage would not file an amended complaint and would drop the case. CAIR then sought attorneys fees against Savage but U.S. District Court judge Susan Illston denied that request.|$|E
