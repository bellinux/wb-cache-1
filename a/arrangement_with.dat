5|$|Some rulers {{handled this}} <b>arrangement</b> <b>with</b> less subtlety than others. Domitian {{was not so}} subtle. From the outset of his reign, he {{stressed}} the reality of his autocracy. He disliked aristocrats and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} home, Houston {{negotiated}} a labor-swap <b>arrangement</b> <b>with</b> Raven Hill's overseer Captain Frank Hatch. In {{lieu of a}} cash payment for his services, the bulk of Houston's slave labor force was engaged to work on Hatch's property at Bermuda Spring. The remaining slaves were retained as house labor for Margaret. Eventually, Houston became the owner of Bermuda Spring when he and Hatch swapped properties, and he set about to build the Woodland home for his wife. The first child to be born {{in the house was}} Margaret (Maggie) Lea Houston, arriving on April 13, 1848, while Congress was in session and Houston was in Washington.|$|E
5|$|After two years, Glidden {{abandoned}} {{production of}} cortisone {{to concentrate on}} Substance S. Julian developed a multistep process for conversion of pregnenolone, available in abundance from soybean oil sterols, to cortexolone. In 1952, Glidden, which had been producing progesterone and other steroids from soybean oil, shut down its own production and began importing them from Mexico through an <b>arrangement</b> <b>with</b> Diosynth (a small Mexican company founded in 1947 by Russell Marker after leaving Syntex). Glidden's cost of production of cortexolone was relatively high, so Upjohn decided to use progesterone, available in large quantity at low cost from Syntex, to produce cortisone and hydrocortisone.|$|E

5|$|Although his {{original}} objective was solely {{to protect the}} Serb population against the Ustaše, Dangić quickly became {{an important factor in}} the conflict between the two groups in eastern Bosnia. The Germans sought to win Dangić over to collaboration in order to strengthen anti-Partisan operations in the region, where Dangić's Chetniks reportedly numbered about 10,000 men, but at this time neither Dangić nor any of Mihailović's other commanders had any <b>arrangement</b> <b>with</b> the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Anne's {{family also}} profited from the relationship. Her father, already Viscount Rochford, was created Earl of Wiltshire. Henry {{also came to}} an <b>arrangement</b> <b>with</b> Anne's Irish cousin and created him Earl of Ormond. At the {{magnificent}} banquet to celebrate her father's elevation, Anne took precedence over the Duchesses of Suffolk and Norfolk, seated {{in the place of}} honour beside the King which was usually occupied by the Queen. Thanks to Anne's intervention, her widowed sister Mary received an annual pension of £100, and Mary's son, Henry Carey, was educated at a prestigious Cistercian monastery.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2008 U.S. Championships, Meissner {{worked on}} her spins with Todd Eldredge. She placed 4th {{in the short}} program and 7th in the free after falling three times. She placed 7th overall and was {{selected}} for the U.S. team to the 2008 World Championships. After Nationals, Eldredge called her with more input on her spins and recommended his long-time coach Richard Callaghan. Meissner made the choice to switch coaches from long-time coach Pam Gregory to a temporary <b>arrangement</b> <b>with</b> Richard Callaghan in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. She trained with Callaghan for the six weeks between Nationals and the 2008 World Championships.|$|E

They are commemorated by name through the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour located in St George's Chapel in Westminster Abbey. In addition to its mandated duties, the Commission maintains, under <b>arrangement</b> <b>with</b> applicable governments, over 40,000 non-Commonwealth war graves and over 25,000 non-war military and civilian graves.|$|E
5|$|East of {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} was a two-storey building with a basement. The basement was probably used for storage while the above two floors provided accommodation. The purpose of the buildings along {{the west end of}} the north range is uncertain. The sparse <b>arrangement,</b> <b>with</b> little provision for lighting, has led to suggestions that it was used as stables, however there are no drains which are usually associated with stables. The tower in the northwest corner of the castle had a garderobe and fireplace on each of the three above-ground floors, and there was a basement underneath.|$|E
5|$|Food Circus: The Food Circus was a {{food court}} in the former armory, later named the Center House, and {{recently}} renamed The Armory (2012) as a remodel of the building continues. Unlike the current <b>arrangement</b> <b>with</b> a stage and a large open space for dancing, events, and temporary booths, many food booths {{were in the middle}} of the room as well as at the edges. There were 52concessionaires in all, nine of them with exhibits in addition to their food for sale. Beginning in 1963, the Food Circus also housed a variety of museums, including Jones' Fantastic Show, the Jules Charbneau World of Miniatures, and the Pullen Klondike Museum.|$|E
