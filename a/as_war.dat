5|$|After the German {{collapse}} in November 1918, {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow during the peace negotiations. The four Helgoland-class ships were allowed to remain in Germany, however, and were therefore spared {{the destruction of the}} fleet in Scapa Flow. Ostfriesland and her sisters were eventually ceded to the victorious Allied powers <b>as</b> <b>war</b> reparations; Ostfriesland was transferred to the United States Navy. She was sunk during air power trials off the Virginia Capes in July 1921.|$|E

5|$|Both ships {{survived the}} war, though Leipzig was in very poor {{condition}} following an accidental collision {{with the heavy}} cruiser Prinz Eugen late in the war. Leipzig was therefore used as a barracks ship before being scuttled in 1946. Nürnberg, however, emerged from the war largely unscathed, and as a result, was seized by the Soviet Navy <b>as</b> <b>war</b> reparations, and commissioned into the Soviet fleet as Admiral Makarov; she continued in Soviet service until the late 1950s, and was broken up for scrap by 1960.|$|E

He characterized the Cold <b>War</b> <b>as</b> an issue of containment.

5|$|Napoleon's campaigns {{acquired}} Italian {{pieces by}} treaties, <b>as</b> <b>war</b> reparations, and Northern European pieces as spoils {{as well as}} some antiquities excavated in Egypt, though {{the vast majority of the}} latter were seized <b>as</b> <b>war</b> reparations by the British army and are now part of collections of the British Museum. On the other hand, the Dendera zodiac is, like the Rosetta stone, claimed by Egypt even though it was acquired in 1821, before the Egyptian Anti-export legislation of 1835. The Louvre administration has thus argued in favor of retaining this item despite requests by Egypt for its return. The museum participates too in arbitration sessions held via UNESCO's Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to Its Countries of Origin. The museum consequently returned in 2009 five Egyptian fragments of frescoes (30cm x 15cm each) whose existence of the tomb of origin had only been brought to the authorities attention in 2008, eight to five years after their good-faith acquisition by the museum from two private collections and after the necessary respect of the procedure of déclassement from French public collections before the Commission scientifique nationale des collections des musées de France.|$|E
