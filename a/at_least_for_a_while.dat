5|$|The {{foggy weather}} made it {{difficult}} to see positions from either side, but Frederick and his commanders used the fog to their advantage. Leaving a cavalry unit and a cluster of infantry in front of the northernmost end of the Austrian line (the Austrian right), Frederick deployed the remainder (and bulk) of his forces toward Leuthen itself; Charles saw them start their redeployment, and may have interpreted the maneuver as withdrawal, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b>|$|E
25|$|A few escaped, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Karl Boro {{made it up}} on to {{the roof}} but then {{made the mistake of}} coming back into the building, where he was treated to heavy {{bruising}} to his arms and legs, a fractured skull, and bleeding in his chest cavity. Jaroslaw Engel, from Poland, managed to use builders' scaffolding {{to get out of the}} school, but he was caught in the street by some police drivers who smashed him over the head, laid him on the ground and stood over him smoking while his blood ran out across the tarmac.|$|E

The team not only worked for Stampede Wrestling while in Canada, but also worked for NWA All-Star Wrestling based in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Fabulous Kangaroosâ€™ 1965 run in NWA All-Star Wrestling {{turned out to be}} the last time the original Kangaroos teamed together. In June 1965, the Kangaroos lost to Don Leo Jonathan and Jim Hardy and then split up. Heffernan left Australia to tour the world in 1953 and wanted to return to his homeland, while Costello was determined to remain in the United States <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> longer.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} stem the turmoil, Crispi offered Colajanni the Ministry of Agriculture, which he refused. When riots on the island got out of hand, Crispi asked Colajanni to {{undertake}} a mission of appeasement on Sicily. On January 3, 1894, only four days after Crispi had promised Colajanni {{there would be no}} state of siege, martial law was declared in the island. General Roberto Morra di Lavriano was dispatched with 40,000 troops to restore order. Colajanni condemned the Fasci leaders for lacking to keep the peace. After conferring with general Morra he issued a manifesto in which he urged the people to restore order. He argued that the government was engaged in bettering the working conditions and deserved their confidence, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> People breaking the peace he called fools and traitors.|$|E
25|$|Russkaya Mysl {{released}} The Family Idyll (Semeynaya idillia, 1890), a {{year later}} another symbolic poem Death (Smert) appeared in Severny Vestnik. In 1891 Merezhkovsky and Gippius made their first journey to Europe, staying mostly in Italy and France; the poem End of the Century (Konetz Veka) inspired by the European trip, came out two years later. On their return home the couple stayed {{for a while in}} Guppius' dacha at Vyshny Volochyok; it was here that Merezhkovsky started working on his first novel, The Death of the Gods. Julian the Apostate. A year later it was finished, but by this time the situation with Severny Vestnik has changed: outraged by Akim Volynsky's intrusive editorial methods, Merezhkovsky severed ties with the magazine, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> In the late 1891 he published his translation of Sophocles' Antigona in Vestnik Evropy, part of Goethe's Faustus (in Russkoye Obozrenye) and Euripides' Hyppolite (in Vestnik Evropy again). The latter came out in 1893, after the couple's second trip to Europe where their first encounter with Dmitry Filosofov occurred. Merezhkovsky's vivid impressions of Greece and the subsequent spurt of the new ideas provided the foundation for his second novel.|$|E

500|$|Stephen hired mercenaries to man his forts, which {{diminished the}} {{military}} {{role of the}} boyars' retinues within the Moldavian military forces. He also set up a personal guard 3,000 strong and, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> an Armenian-only unit. To strengthen the defence of Moldavia, he obliged the peasantry to bear arms. Moldavian chronicles recorded that if [...] "he found a peasant lacking arrows, bow or sword, or coming to the army without spurs for the horse, he mercilessly put that man to death." [...] The military reforms increased Moldavia's military potential, enabling Stephen to muster an army of more than 40,000 strong.|$|E

His brother (later among the murdered), similarly was well-treated by a German unit where he worked in the kitchen. On another occasion, two German soldiers, aware that the SD was selecting for execution Jews who had no work, pretended they were needed for work with their unit, thus saving, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> a group of about 30 people.
