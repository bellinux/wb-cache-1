40|$|HEMA or 2 -hydroxyethyl {{methacrylate}} {{is a small}} monomer that is in widespread use, {{not only}} in dentistry. Its popularity in biomedical applications must be attributed to its relatively good biocompatibility, even though the uncured monomer is notorious for its high allergic potential. HEMA presents as a fluid that is well solvable in water, ethanol and/or acetone. This property and its solvent-like nature make HEMA frequently added to dental adhesives. It improves the stability of <b>adhesive</b> <b>solutions</b> containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic components, basically avoiding phase-separations that are typical of HEMA-free/poor adhesives. Another important characteristic of HEMA is its high hydrophilicity, making it an excellent adhesion-promoting agent for dentin. However, both in uncured and cured state, HEMA will readily absorb water. Uncured, water sorption may dilute the monomers to an extent that polymerization is inhibited. Cured, it still exhibits hydrophilicity, promoting water uptake with consequent nano-leakage and swelling. Like all methacrylates, HEMA is vulnerable to hydrolysis at basic and acidic pH. HEMA also lowers the vapor pressure of water and probably also of ethanol, thereby hindering good solvent evaporation from <b>adhesive</b> <b>solutions.</b> All these unfavorable properties along with the inferior polymerization efficiency of HEMA itself deteriorate the mechanical properties of HEMA-rich adhesives. There are consequently both PROS and CONS regarding the addition of HEMA to dental adhesives.

Objectives: The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the micro-tensile bond strength (mTBS) of a two-step self-etch and a two-step total-etch adhesive to dentin and to morphologically characterize their interaction with dentin after functioning in vivo for 1 year. Methods: Class-V cavities were prepared on facial surfaces of 8 intact teeth of one monkey, and restored using Unifil Bond/Unifil F (GC; UU) and Single Bond/Z 250 (3 M Espe; SZ). One year later, 8 other teeth were restored with the same materials following the same experimental protocol (control). After 24 hours, the 1 -year and 1 -day restored teeth were extracted and subjected to mTBS-testing and Fe-SEM examination of the resultant resin-dentin interfaces. Results: The mTBSs of the 1 -year specimens (14. 4 MPa for UU; 11. 7 MPa for SZ) were significantly (one-way ANOVA and Scheffe's test: p< 0. 05) lower than that of the 1 -day specimens (38. 7 MPa for UU; 48. 1 MPa for SZ) for both adhesives. Fe-SEM examination of the fractured mTBS dentin surfaces and the cross-sectioned interfaces showed that the amount of porosity within the hybrid layer produced by Single Bond increased over time. On the contrary, morphological signs of hybrid layer degradation were not observed for Unifil Bond.

40|$|In {{mobile and}} {{handheld}} consumer electronic markets, product use conditions drive {{the requirement for}} mechanical strength and device durability. The majority of relatively large form factor electronic components in a laptop, mobile internet device, PDA, or mobile phone use an adhesive as a stiffener to help protect the component from physical stresses imposed by daily wear and tear. Described herein is an innovative solution referred to as Solid State Pre-Formed Electronics Adhesive (SPEA), which enables a decrease in circuit board manufacturing throughput time while increasing mechanical durability with a consistent and characterized adhesive application process. Today, many consumer electronic ODM 2 ̆ 7 s (Original Design Manufacturers) and CM 2 ̆ 7 s (Contract Manufacturers) use a liquid adhesive dispensed after placement of an electronic component within the SMT (Surface Mount Technology) process. On average, this adds up to 60 seconds to the throughput time of a typical motherboard as the material needs to be applied and then cured. In addition, the current adhesive dispense application process is not tightly controlled and is highly variable depending on operator, material type, and circuit board density. Data will demonstrate {{that the effect of}} the adhesive deposition profile and consistency in application directly affects repeatable margin increase gains in a dynamic stress event. In partnership with a specialty chemical company, a unique thermoset epoxy compound was designed to provide maximum component to circuit board interconnect strength while maintaining its form at ambient temperatures. When applied to electronics manufacturing, the compound has the following advantages over current solutions: 1. Reduced Manufacturing Processing Time: Enables a solution that can be transitioned transparently into a circuit board manufacturing facility which reduces the average processing time for a typical device motherboard. 2. Improved Application Repeatability: Enables a solution that increases adhesive deposition consistency and placement repeatability, critical in achieving improved dynamic performance. 3. Delivers a Reference, Characterized Solution: Current industry adhesive application techniques and materials vary widely and component manufacturers cannot validate reliability performance with a confident baseline. This is due to the high variability of performance in commercially available adhesives. SPEA provides a characterized <b>adhesive</b> <b>solution</b> with a clear baseline margin increase on which to evaluate dynamically stressed system performance. The need to continually increase the resistance to component damage through dynamic testing is a critical aspect to consider given market trends and device roadmaps.

Better is to measure the actual HAp-dissolving capacity, taking into account also the potential of functional monomers to deposit stable monomer-calcium salts. In this study, we investigated the etching efficacy of functional monomers by measuring the calcium concentration using ICP-AES {{and the amount of}} monomer-Ca salt formation using NMR. Methods: The functional monomers 2 -methacryloyloxyethyl dihydrogen phosphate (2 -MEP), 6 -methacryloyloxyhexyl dihydrogen phosphate (6 -MHP), 10 -methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (10 -MDP), 2 -methacryloxyethyl phenyl hydrogen phosphate (phenyl-P), 4 -methacryloxyethyl trimellitic acid (4 -MET), glycerol phosphate dimethacrylate (GPDM), and 10 -methacryloyloxy tetraethyleneglycol dihydrogen phosphate (MTEGP) were investigated. 1. 0 g functional monomer was used to prepare a 15 wt% monomer/ 45 wt% ethanol/ 40 wt% water solution that was subsequently mixed with 0. 2 g of HAp for 1 hr. [Ca] and [P] of the initial and supernatant liquid were measured using ICP-AES. The precipitation of monomer-Ca salts was confirmed with XRD and analyzed using 31 P MAS NMR. Results: ICP-AES revealed the highest [Ca] produced by phenyl-P, followed in order by 2 MEP = MTEG-P > GPDM > 6 -MHP > 10 -MDP > 4 -MET. Only 10 -MDP formed 10 -MDP_Ca salt, indicating that 10 -MDP released more Ca from HAp than was measured by ICP-AES. Although 10 -MDP seemed to have etched HAp less as appeared from the lower [Ca] measured, part of the released Ca was consumed to form 10 -MDP_Ca salts. Conclusions: The high bonding potential of 10 -MDP-based adhesives is suggested to result from a combined etching and chemical bonding potential. status: submitte...|$|R
40|$|Four {{ultrasonic}} {{methods were}} evaluated for assembly of experimental plastic parts for detonators: (1) welding, (2) crimping and staking, (3) insertion, and (4) reactivation of adhesives. For welding, staking and insertion, plastics with low elastic moduli, such as acrylics and polycarbonate, produced the best results. Thermosetting, hot-melt, and <b>solution</b> <b>adhesives</b> {{could all be}} activated ultrasonically to form good bonds on plastics and other materials. This evaluation indicated that thermoplastic detonator parts could be assembled ultrasonically in shorter times than by present production techniques with high bond strengths and high product acceptance rates...|$|R
