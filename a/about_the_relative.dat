5|$|A {{few years}} later there was a debate between Heaviside and Peter Guthrie Tait <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> merits of vector {{analysis}} and quaternions. The result was the realisation {{that there was no}} need for the greater physical insights provided by quaternions if the theory was purely local, and vector analysis became commonplace. Maxwell was proven correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism is considered one of the great accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics.|$|E
5|$|Discussion {{continues}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> advantage or {{disadvantage of}} using the blades. Researchers and analysts {{also point out that}} the research studies are done on level, stationary treadmills, and do not measure performance from starting blocks or on actual curved tracks. They also do not take into account differences in physiology between amputees and non-amputees, who have such factors as musculature, blade height and weight and differences in blood circulation patterns due to the history of their limb loss.|$|E
5|$|Although 300 {{mutations}} of ATP7B {{have been}} described, in most populations {{the cases of}} Wilson's disease are due to {{a small number of}} mutations specific for that population. For instance, in Western populations the H1069Q mutation (replacement of a histidine by a glutamine at position 1069 in the protein) is present in 37–63% of cases, while in China this mutation is very uncommon and R778L (arginine to leucine at 778) is found more often. Relatively little is known <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> impact of various mutations, although the H1069Q mutation seems to predict later onset and predominantly neurological problems, according to some studies.|$|E

5|$|Every May since 1987, the University of Chicago {{has held}} the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt, in which large teams of {{students}} compete to obtain notoriously esoteric items from a list. Since 1963, the Festival of the Arts (FOTA) takes over campus for 7–10 days of exhibitions and interactive artistic endeavors. Every January, the university holds a week-long winter festival, Kuviasungnerk/Kangeiko, which include early morning exercise routines and fitness workshops. The university also annually holds a summer carnival and concert called Summer Breeze that hosts outside musicians, and is home to Doc Films, a student film society founded in 1932 that screens films nightly at the university. Since 1946, the university has organized the Latke-Hamantash Debate, which involves humorous discussions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> merits and meanings of latkes and hamantashen.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, a {{rotavirus}} vaccine was licensed {{for use in}} the United States. Clinical {{trials in}} the United States, Finland, and Venezuela had found it to be 80 to 100% effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by rotavirus A, and researchers had detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects. The manufacturer, however, withdrew it from the market in 1999, after it was discovered that the vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction, in one of every 12,000 vaccinated infants. The experience provoked intense debate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> risks and benefits of a rotavirus vaccine.|$|E
5|$|The 1960s saw {{the rise}} of regionalist {{politics}} in Bombay, {{with the formation of}} the Shiv Sena on 19 June 1966, out of a feeling of resentment <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> marginalisation of the native Marathi people in Bombay. Shiv Sena switched from 'Marathi Cause' to larger 'Hindutva Cause' in 1985 and joined hands with Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) in same year. The Congress had dominated the politics of Bombay from independence until the early 1980s, when the Shiv Sena won the 1985 Bombay Municipal Corporation elections.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Parsi and Marwaris Migrant {{communities}} owned {{majority of the}} industry and trade enterprises in the city, while the white-collar jobs were mainly sought by the South Indian migrants to the city. The Shiv Sena party was established on 19 June 1966 by Bombay cartoonist Bal Thackeray, out of a feeling of resentment <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> marginalization of the native Marathi people in their native state Maharashtra. In the 1960s and 1970s, Shiv Sena fought for rights of native Marathis. In the late 1960s, Nariman Point and Cuffe Parade were reclaimed and developed. During the 1970 there were Bombay-Bhiwandi riots. During the 1970s, coastal communication increased between Bombay and south western coast of India, after introduction of ships by the London-based trade firm Shepherd. These ships facilitated the entry of Goan and Mangalorean Catholics to Bombay.|$|E
5|$|Schirra gave {{a public}} lecture at Rice University after {{returning}} to Houston, where he received a motorcade through the city. However, the Cuban Missile Crisis had been steadily escalating through September, and helped drive discussion of Schirra's successful flight down the news schedules; public concern <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> effectiveness of Soviet and American space launchers was displaced by a more pressing concern over Soviet military rockets. He visited Washington, D.C., to receive the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President Kennedy on October 16, the same day Kennedy had first seen U-2 photographs of missile sites in Cuba; the meeting was friendly and informal despite the circumstances. Robert Kennedy, Schirra later noted, took him aside and sounded him out about a potential political career, {{the same way he}} had sounded out John Glenn a year earlier. Unlike Glenn, however, Schirra politely turned the suggestion down, and chose to remain with NASA. His later career saw him commanding the backup crew for the first Gemini mission, then the prime crew for the 1965 Gemini 6A mission, where he flew the first active rendezvous between two spacecraft - earlier plans for it to conduct the first on-orbit docking had been cancelled - and finally commanding the first Apollo mission, Apollo 7, in 1968. He retired from NASA in the summer of 1969, the only astronaut to fly on Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo.|$|E
5|$|The first {{remarkable}} historiographical {{school of}} {{interpretation of the}} history of Argentina was founded by members of the 1837 generation, including Bartolomé Mitre. Mitre regarded the May Revolution as an iconic expression of political egalitarianism: a conflict between modern freedoms and oppression represented by the Spanish monarchy, and an attempt to establish a national organization on constitutional principles as opposed to the charismatic authority of the caudillos. These authors' views were treated as canonical {{until the end of the}} 19thcentury, when the proximity of the centennial encouraged authors to seek new perspectives. The newer authors would differ <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> weight of the causes of the May Revolution and about whose intervention in the events was more decisive, but the main views expressed by Mitre were kept, such as to consider the revolution to be the birth of modern Argentina and an unavoidable event. These authors introduced the idea of popular intervention as another key element. By the time of the World Wars, liberal authors attempted to impose an ultimate and unquestionable historical perspective; Ricardo Levene and the Academia Nacional de la Historia were exponents of this tendency, which still kept most perspectives of Mitre. Left-wing authors took a revisionist view based on nationalism and anti-imperialism; they minimized the dispute between criollos and peninsulars and portrayed events as a dispute between enlightenment and absolutism. However, most of their work was focused on other historical periods.|$|E

25|$|Stereotypes can be {{a source}} of {{heuristic}} attributes. In a face-to-face conversation with a stranger, judging their intelligence is more computationally complex than judging the colour of their skin. So if the subject has a stereotype <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> intelligence of whites, blacks, and Asians, that racial attribute might substitute for the more intangible attribute of intelligence. The pre-conscious, intuitive nature of attribute substitution explains how subjects can be influenced by the stereotype while thinking that they have made an honest, unbiased evaluation of the other person's intelligence.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{polyploidy}} in natural {{populations in the}} genus Arabidopsis. It summarizes information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of Arabidopsis thaliana, a prominent model organism for research on genetics and plant physiology. Literature shows that polyploidy affects ecological, climate and soil requirements, as well as mating system of the plants in genus Arabidopsis. Most of the published studies {{is focused on the}} study of artificial polyploid hybrids created by crossing experiments - especially with the Arabidopsis thaliana. In contrast, my thesis deals with the natural polyploids observed within the genus. In particular, I focus on the nearly unstudied di- polyploid complex of high-altitude populations of Arabidopsis arenosa in the Tatra Mountains. This complex represents a unique model system for studying the effects of polyploidization in the wild - thanks to the high morphological and ecological diversity of the hybrids, and to <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> genetic similarity of the parental populations.

This is normally done by including an outgroup in the input data so that the root is necessarily between the outgroup {{and the rest of}} the taxa in the tree, or by introducing additional assumptions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> rates of evolution on each branch, such as an application of the molecular clock hypothesis.|$|E

With its departure from a scholarly adherence to the Early Pointed manner of the Gothic style it also marks the onset of High Victorianism in New Zealand. This first portion of the building was finished in 1865.|$|E
