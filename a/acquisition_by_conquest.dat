50|$|Before 1814, {{the history}} of nobility is {{separate}} {{for each of the}} eleven provinces that make up the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In each of these, there were in the early Middle Ages a number of feudal lords who often were just as powerful, and sometimes more so than the rulers themselves. In old times, no other title existed but that of knight. In the middle of the fourteenth century, quarrels between the feudal lords reduced many families and castles to ruins, which contributed to the Dukes of Burgundy's <b>acquisition</b> <b>by</b> <b>conquest</b> or inheritance of many of the provinces forming the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In 1581, Philip II of Spain, heir of the Dukes of Burgundy was abjured by representatives of the Seven Provinces, which left a great part of the executive and legislative power to the Ridderschap of each province, which consisted of the representatives of those families of the old feudal nobility. In 1798, the revolution did away with their power, and it was not before 1814, when William of Orange became King of the Netherlands that they were again appointed in another form, but {{by the time of the}} constitution of 1848, they had no influence in government affairs. In 1814, if no higher title was recognised, the men only were to bear the hereditary predicate of Jonkheer. The old feudal families obtained the title of Baron or Baroness for all their descendants.|$|E
50|$|Coolidge {{was one of}} Vermont's presidential electors in 1844, {{and cast}} his ballot for Henry Clay and Theodore Frelinghuysen. He served as President of the Vermont Whig Convention in 1847, which passed resolutions {{opposing}} the Mexican-American War and the <b>acquisition</b> of territory <b>by</b> <b>conquest,</b> and {{in favor of the}} Wilmot Proviso. Coolidge's anti-slavery views also included the idea of returning freed slaves to Africa as settlers, and he was active in both the American Colonization Society and the Vermont Colonization Society.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{attempted}} conquests of Napoleon {{and up to}} {{the attempted}} conquests of Hitler, the disposition of territory acquired under the principle of conquest had to, according to international law, be conducted according to the existing laws of war. This meant that there had to be military occupation followed by a peace settlement, and there was no reasonable chance of the defeated sovereign regaining the land. While a formal peace treaty [...] "makes good any defects in title", it was not required. Recognition by the losing party was not a requirement, [...] "the right of <b>acquisition</b> vested <b>by</b> <b>conquest</b> did not depend on the consent of the dispossessed state". However, the alternative was annexation (part or in whole) which if protested as unlawful, a peace treaty was the only means to legitimize conquest in a time of war. Essentially, conquest itself was a legal act of extinguishing the legal rights of other states without their consent. Under this new framework, it is notable that conquest and subsequent occupation outside of war was illegal.|$|R
2500|$|Michael Lynk {{says that}} article 2 of the Charter {{embodied}} a prevailing legal principle {{that there could}} be [...] "no title by conquest". He says that principle had been expressed through numerous international conferences, doctrines and treaties since the late 19th Century. Lynk cites the examples of the First International Conference of American States in 1890; the United States Stimson Doctrine of 1932; the 1932 League of Nations resolution on Japanese aggression in China; the Buenos Aires Declaration of 1936; and the Atlantic Charter of 1941. Surya Sharma says that a war in self-defense cannot result in <b>acquisition</b> of title <b>by</b> <b>conquest.</b> He says that even if a war is lawful in origin it cannot exceed the limits of legitimate self-defense.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the advent}} of Western European {{exploration}} {{questions have been raised}} about the legality and morality of claims to new territories and the ensuing, often brutal colonisation patterns. The doctrine of discovery justified the <b>acquisition</b> of territories <b>by</b> <b>conquest</b> or other means. By the 19 th century British common law included the doctrine of continuity, which recognised that the property rights of the indigenous people survived after the Crown acquired sovereignty over their territories. The Crown used a general treaty of cession and protection as the instrument for gaining sovereignty. In the context of Western European colonisation, this article discusses the statutory and judicial recognition of New Zealand's Treaty of Waitangi 1840 and native title to land. The ensuing discussion highlights statute and judicial decisions that depart from the Treaty and are unique within the British colonies. This article also discusses the settlement of Treaty-based claims to land and fisheries and the current debate regarding ownership of the land along the seacoast and beneath the sea. The article contributes to the broader discussion on indigenous rights. Indigenous people's rights Colonisation Treaties Foreshore and seabed New Zealand...|$|R
