40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "For 2001 through {{the third quarter of}} 2003, the U. S. airline industry reported operating losses of $ 20. 7 billion. A number of factors [...] including the economic slowdown, a shift in business travel buying behavior, and the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks [...] contributed to these losses by reducing passenger and cargo volumes and depressing fares. To improve their financial position, many airlines cut costs by various means, notably by reducing labor expenditures and by decreasing capacity through cutting flight frequencies, using smaller aircraft, or eliminating service to some communities. Carriers have also reduced some airfares to encourage travel. Despite these efforts, several airlines filed for bankruptcy protection. It remains to be seen when the industry will emerge from this downturn. In response to the industry's financial condition, Congress has provided several forms of financial relief. In September 2001, Congress passed the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, which authorized payments of up to $ 4. 5 billion in pretax cash assistance to reimburse air carriers for losses incurred {{as a direct result of}} the 4 -day government shut-down of air traffic and incremental losses stemming from the terrorist attacks and also authorized up to $ 10 billion in loan guarantees to help airlines gain emergency access to capital. In January 2002, Congress appropriated $ 100 million for new or modified cockpit doors on commercial aircraft to improve security of the flight deck. In the fiscal year 2003 supplemental appropriations act, Congress appropriated $ 2. 4 billion in security cost relief for airlines. To provide information to Congress for its continuing deliberations about whether and, if so, how to provide additional help to the airline industry, we reviewed the payments of major commercial aviation taxes and fees over the last 5 years. The federal government levies or approves various taxes and fees on the commercial aviation industry. These taxes and fees generally are levied as a percentage of the base ticket price or are assessed at a flat rate per occurrence (e. g., per departure or passenger enplanement). The revenues from these taxes and fees support various aspects of the civil aviation system [...] including operation of the air traffic control system, modernization of airport facilities, and support of aviation security related activities. As requested, we focused on the following research questions: (1) What are the major commercial aviation taxes and fees, how much is collected annually, and how are the proceeds used? (2) How did changes in <b>aviation</b> <b>tax</b> and fee collections compare with changes in the industry's operating revenues and expenses from 1998 through 2002 ? (3) How has the total amount of aviation taxes and fees paid varied among carriers?

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of an {{increase}} in <b>aviation</b> fuel <b>tax</b> on reductions in fuel consumption and carbon emissions using data from the US airline industry. The results of simultaneous quantile regression using an unbalanced annual panel of US carriers from 1995 to 2013 suggest that the short-run price elasticities of jet fuel consumption, which are negative and statistically significant for all quantiles, vary from − 0. 350 to − 0. 166. The long-run price elasticities show a similar pattern and vary from − 0. 346 to − 0. 166, though they are statistically significant only for the 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3, and 0. 5 quantiles. The results suggest that the amount of the reduction of fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions would be smaller in the longer term. Our calculation, using values from 2012, suggests that an increase in <b>aviation</b> fuel <b>tax</b> of 4. 3 cents, which was the highest increase in <b>aviation</b> fuel <b>tax</b> in the US during the analysis period, would reduce CO 2 emissions in the US by approximately 0. 14 – 0. 18 % in the short run (1 year after the tax increase). However, perhaps due to the rebound effect, the percentage reduction in CO 2 emissions would decrease to about 0. 008 – 0. 01 % in the long run (3 years after the tax increase) ...|$|R

40|$|Runway and {{airspace}} congestion {{are the primary}} causes of flight delays in the US. These delays cost airlines and airline customers billions of dollars per year. This thesis consists of two essays. The first essay focuses on several of the commonly proposed market-based solutions to airport congestion. Most {{of the literature on}} these market-based solutions has assumed that these remedies are justified by welfare economics, but there is relatively little focus on these justifications. We explore the economic arguments for and against using various market-based approaches to treating airport congestion. The second essay examines the relationship between aviation infrastructure pricing and congestion. <b>Aviation</b> <b>taxes</b> (and some airport fees) are currently designed to tax large aircraft more than small aircraft and flights with more passengers more than flights with few passengers. Several authors have argued that these taxes and fees create an incentive system for airlines to use small aircraft with high frequency, which exacerbates the congestion problem. We study this effect by developing a game theoretic model of airline behavior. (cont.) Using this model, we are able to find a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium behavior for any given set of taxes and fees. These equilibrium results allow us to directly test the potential effects of changing the fees and taxes. We propose an alternative system of taxes and airport fees that charges all similar flights equally, regardless of size, revenue, or the number of passengers. We find that adopting these "flat" taxes and landing fees - i. e. aircraft of all sizes pay equal amounts - would have substantial benefits. The model predicts that the change would reduce congestion levels while making air travel more affordable. by Raphael A. Schorr. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Road {{transport}} and aviation are, or are becoming, {{major sources of}} carbon emissions which {{will need to be}} reduced if the UK’s carbon dioxide (CO 2) reduction targets are to be met. However, since 1980 the real costs of motoring have fallen while those of other transport modes have risen, and rising incomes have also increased transport demand, offsetting efficiency increases. Increased road transport taxation, which could be introduced as part of a green fiscal reform, will be essential if demand is to be managed and carbon emissions from road transport reduced. Taxes on vehicle purchase, ownership and use have different effects, and can be used to pursue different policy goals. For example, taxes on purchase and ownership can incentivise manufacturers to develop low carbon vehicles and people to buy them. Tax measures on vehicle use are needed to reduce congestion and overall energy use. This briefing discusses experience with road {{transport and}} <b>aviation</b> <b>taxes</b> in the UK and other European countries, and considers how they might develop to take account of increasingly stringent CO 2 reduction targets and other issues such as the increasing diversity of road fuels, and the need to maintain government income. In particular, any shift to electric vehicles may require a parallel shift to road user charging if revenues from transport taxes, and incentives to reduce the damaging effects of road transport apart from emissions, are to be maintained. Each tax introduced will affect some people more than others. Increasing fuel duty is progressive overall because most low-income households do not have a car, but there are concerns about the impact on low income motorists, particularly in rural areas, which can be at least partially addressed if the revenues are recycled in a progressive manner. Increasing taxation on air travel is even more progressive because most leisure flying is by the wealthiest 20 per cent of the population and those on low incomes fly very little...|$|R

40|$|General {{aviation}} in the United States {{has been}} {{an important part of the}} economy and American life. General aviation is defined as all flying excluding military and scheduled airline operations, and is utilized in many areas of our society. The majority of aircraft operations and airports in the United States are categorized as general aviation, and general aviation contributes more than one percent to the United States gross domestic product each year. Despite the many benefits of general aviation, the lead emissions from aviation gasoline consumption are of great concern. General aviation emits over half the lead emissions in the United States or over 630 tons in 2005. The other significant negative externality attributed to general aviation usage is aircraft accidents. General aviation accidents have caused over 8000 fatalities over the period 1994 - 2006. A recent Federal Aviation Administration proposed increase in the <b>aviation</b> gasoline <b>tax</b> from 19. 4 to 70. 1 cents per gallon has renewed interest in better understanding the implications of such a tax increase as well as the possible optimal rate of taxation. Few studies have examined aviation fuel elasticities and all have failed to study general aviation fuel elasticities. Chapter one fills that gap and examines the elasticity of aviation gasoline consumption in United States general aviation. Utilizing aggregate time series and dynamic panel data, the price and income elasticities of demand are estimated. The price elasticity of demand for aviation gasoline is estimated to range from - 0. 093 to - 0. 185 in the short-run and from - 0. 132 to - 0. 303 in the long-run. These results prove to be similar in magnitude to automobile gasoline elasticities and therefore tax policies could more closely mirror those of automobile tax policies. The second chapter examines the costs associated with general aviation accidents. Given the large number of general aviation operations as well as the large number of fatalities and injuries attributed to general aviation accidents in the United States, understanding the costs to society is of great importance. This chapter estimates the direct and indirect costs associated with general aviation accidents in the United States. The indirect costs are estimated via the human capital approach in addition to the willingness-to-pay approach. The average annual accident costs attributed to general aviation are found to be $ 2. 32 billion and $ 3. 81 billion (2006 US$) utilizing the human capital approach and willingness-to-pay approach, respectively. These values appear to be fairly robust when subjected to a sensitivity analysis. These costs highlight the large societal benefits from accident and fatality reduction. The final chapter derives a second-best optimal <b>aviation</b> gasoline <b>tax</b> developed from previous general equilibrium frameworks. This optimal tax reflects both the lead pollution and accident externalities, as well as the balance between excise taxes and labor taxes to finance government spending. The calculated optimal tax rate is $ 4. 07 per gallon, which is over 20 times greater than the current tax rate and 5 times greater than the Federal <b>Aviation</b> Administration proposed <b>tax</b> rate. The calculated optimal tax rate is also over 3 times greater than automobile gasoline optimal tax rates calculated by previous studies. The Pigovian component is $ 1. 36, and we observe that the accident externality is taxed more severely than the pollution externality. The largest component of the optimal tax rate is the Ramsey component. At $ 2. 70, the Ramsey component reflects the ability of the government to raise revenue aviation gasoline which is price inelastic. The calculated optimal tax is estimated to reduce lead emissions by over 10 percent and reduce accidents by 20 percent. Although unlikely to be adopted by policy makers, the optimal tax benefits are apparent and it sheds light on the need to reduce these negative externalities via policy changes...|$|R
