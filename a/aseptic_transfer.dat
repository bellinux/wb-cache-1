At this time his sole production was catgut in various forms. Merson moved his premises to St. John’s Hill in 1920 as need for sutures was increasing. The Iodine process was used for sterilising catgut string, which thereafter was dried in the open air becoming contaminated thereby - and then transferred to Glass tubes in which it was re-sterilised by iodine solution and then, by a process of <b>aseptic</b> <b>transfer,</b> the iodine was decolourised by thiosulphate which, in turn, by further <b>aseptic</b> <b>transfer,</b> was replaced by a tubing fluid containing phenyl mercuric nitrate. The tubes were then sealed by heat. This process had been in use right from 1915 with various modifications and improvements.|$|E
40|$|Novel {{methods and}} {{apparatus}} that employ the rapid heating characteristics of microwave irradiation {{to facilitate the}} <b>aseptic</b> <b>transfer</b> of nutrients, products, and other materials between microbially sensitive systems and the external environment are described. The microwave-sterilizable access port (MSAP) consists of a 600 -W magnetron emitting at a frequency of 2. 45 GHz, a sterilization chamber with inlet and outlet flow lines, and a specimen transfer interface. Energy is routed to the sterilization chamber via a coaxial transmission line where small quantities of water couple strongly with the incident radiation to produce a superheated vapor phase. The efficiency of energy transfer is enhanced {{through the use of}} microwave susceptors within the sterilization chamber. Mating surfaces are thermally sterilized through direct contact with the hot gas. Efficacy has been demonstrated using the thermophile Bacillus stearothermophilus...|$|E

40|$|Transferring {{material}} {{from the outside world}} into an aseptic filling isolator is regularly a challenge. Usually, a form of transfer lock brings required material, such as syringe containers ("tubs"), into the <b>aseptic</b> area. Different <b>transfer</b> lock configurations exist, ranging from simple alcohol spraying and volatile hydrogen peroxide (VHP) to full e-beam in-line sterilizers. This article presents a new barrier system based upon gaseous plasma decontamination. Plasma, as an ionized gas, is found to be capable of inactivating a number of sporulated forms of microorganisms, from polymers to stainless steel. The presented system operates in vacuum and only decontaminates the outer surface of syringe tubs. The plasma itself does not penetrate into the tub. The focus of this publication is to present the operating principles and develop and establish a validation routine on the basis of standard commercial biological indicators...|$|R
40|$|Aims:  The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a system that would allow biofilms to be {{cultivated}} under strictly defined conditions in terms of dissolved oxygen, fluid shear and to assess whether the method was suitable for the detection of respiratory activity stratification in biofilm samples. Methods:  The system is a modified version a commercially available laboratory biofilm reactor and incorporates a number of features such as the provision of defined levels of dissolved oxygen, constant average shear, enhanced gas–liquid mass <b>transfer,</b> <b>aseptic</b> operation and the ability to remove biofilm for ex situ analysis during or after continuous cultivation. Conclusions:  The system was shown to be effective for the characterization of the effects of dissolved oxygen on a pure culture of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The versatility of the system offers the potential for cultivating pure culture biofilm in defined, controlled conditions and facilitates a range of analyses that can be performed ex situ. Significance and Impact of the Study:  The ability to provide strict regulation of environmental conditions and enhanced transfer of oxygen to the biofilm during cultivation are important, first because oxygen is known to regulate biofilm development in several micro-organisms and second because many conventional biofilm cultivation systems may not provide adequate oxygen supply to the biofilm...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{cleanliness}} of environmental air on the microbial contamination of a simulated i. v. -admixture during its preparation by <b>aseptic</b> <b>transfer</b> was studied under three conditions: (i) in a laminar air flow (LAF) bench situated in a class 1000 clean room, (ii) in an LAF bench in a microbiology laboratory and (iii) {{on a bench in}} an ordinary laboratory. Three thousand bottles were manually filled with 10 ml of a nutrient broth under each of the three conditions. The liquid was transferred by means of a syringe and a needle that pierced through the rubber closures of the bottles. The numbers of contaminated bottles under those three conditions were 1, 1 and 2, respectively. Background contamination had no demonstrable effect on the incidence of contamination, provided that preparation of the simulated i. v. -admixture solution was performed by skilled personnel in an LAF cabinet and air contact is avoided...|$|E
40|$|A project {{student in}} our {{laboratory}} obtained inexplicable results whilst using the acetylene reduction method (Stewart et al., 1967; Hardy et al., 1968). All her data showed consistently high values for ethylene when {{a range of}} values had been expected. It was noted that during this experiment, which required transfer of cultures using aseptic procedures, she was using a blue, but partially vented, Bunsen flame. When the experiment was repeated using a fully vented Bunsen flame during <b>aseptic</b> <b>transfer,</b> the predicted range of data was ob-tained. This led to {{an investigation into the}} transfer of ethylene during aseptic procedures and the implications for acetylene reduction assays. METHODS The tops were removed from Bijou bottles (7 cm 3, with tops drilled to expose rubber liners to facilitate transfer of gas with a syringe) and the necks of the bottles were heated in a Bunsen flame using a standard aseptic procedure. The tops were immediately replaced. During exposure to the flame the bottles were held at 45 " to avoid spillage of contents and to prevent abnormal amounts of gas entering the bottles. Ethylene was measured by injecting 1 cm 3 of the atmosphere from the bottle into a Varian Aerograph Series 1400 gas chromatograph. The column (2. 7 m x 2. 5 mm diam.) was packed with Poropak R and run a...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} produce calli with explants of aseptic {{seedlings}} after germination of G. trichosantha ssp. trichosantha seeds by {{plant tissue culture}} method and to examine the ultrastructure of the produced calli with electron microscope preparation. Materials and Methods: Seeds of G. trichosantha ssp. trichosantha were germinated in hormone-free Murashige and Skoog in in vitro conditions. Hypocotyl, epicotyl, cotyledon, young primer leaf, apical meristem and root explants taken from 30 -day <b>aseptic</b> seedlings were <b>transferred</b> to Murashige and Skoog media for callus production which contained varying concentrations of 6 -benzilamynopurine, indole acetic acid and 2, 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Results: Two types of calli were determined: Yellow calli (Type 1) and Black calli (Type 2) with darkened colour and appearance that have not lost their development properties. Following lead staining, thin sections were examined by transmission electron microscope. The best callus production occurred at the Murashige and Skoog medium containing indole acetic acid and 6 -benzilamynopurine and in root explants. The cells of Type 1 calli were spherical and large. The cells contained usually one nucleus and nucleolus. Also the cells contained a very large vacuole, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi complex, mitochondria, ribosomes, plastids. Deformed cells and spherical cells were determined in Type 2 calli. The cells were observed to have smaller vacoules and higher numbers of mitochondria different from Type 1 calli. Type 1 and Type 2 calli showed bulging mitochondrial cristae. Electron-dense droplets were observed in vacuoles of both Type 1 and Type 2 calli. </p...|$|R
40|$|Biology {{educators}} emphasize aseptic technique {{when teaching}} lab courses. Aseptic technique {{is very important}} in microbiology to ensure safety and prevent cross-contamination. Although it can be assessed throughout the semester by examining the students’ technique and observation of contamination, this tool offers a simple semester-long graded assessment of each student’s technique. The procedures allow the students to perform a quick exercise that can determine if cross-contamination occurs, thus determining if aseptic technique was observed. Instructors can quickly check for the presence of cross-contamination. After implementing this procedure, a quantifiable improvement in my students’ aseptic technique throughout the semester was observed. It was noted that between the middle and end of the semester there was a slight increase in the amount of cross-contamination but still well below the contamination observed {{at the beginning of the}} semester. This procedure was a valuable way to assess aseptic technique during the course of a semester. A search for “aseptic technique” on the American Society of Microbiology website reveals that several lab experiments and job opportunities mention the importance of aseptic technique. It is a skill that must be used for all laboratory procedures when working with microorganisms. It is important for both the safety of the students and for the proper handling of microorganisms. There are several good explanations of aseptic technique on the Internet, and the Nuffield Foundation provides a very good description of techniques (1). The goal of this project is to provide instructors with a tool to assess the aseptic technique of their students by using simple transfers of bacteria to fresh media to identify cross-contamination. When class experiments do not work students may not understand how poor aseptic technique impacted the project. This tool would work best for undergraduate students in an introductory microbiology course, so students can see the effects of poor aseptic technique. Adding a graded assignment to their aseptic technique ensures their full effort in this key aspect of microbiology. The procedure can be presented during the first laboratory meeting as a way to explain the importance of <b>aseptic</b> technique and <b>transferring</b> cultures. It works well as an introductory lab since it also introduces the students to microorganisms and the need to incubate samples to observe growth. This semester I used this tool as a way to monitor the students’ progress from the beginning to the end of the semester. I made it a part of their first class, the midterm practical, and their final practical. </span...|$|R
