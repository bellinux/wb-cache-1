25|$|Monosaccharides are {{classified}} according to three different characteristics: {{the placement of}} its carbonyl group, the number of carbon atoms it contains, and its chiral handedness. If the carbonyl group is an aldehyde, the monosaccharide is an aldose; if the carbonyl group is a ketone, the monosaccharide is a ketose. Monosaccharides with three carbon atoms are called trioses, those with four are called tetroses, five are called pentoses, six are hexoses, and so on. These two systems of classification are often combined. For example, glucose is an <b>aldohexose</b> (a six-carbon aldehyde), ribose is an aldopentose (a five-carbon aldehyde), and fructose is a ketohexose (a six-carbon ketone).|$|E
2500|$|In these cyclic forms, {{the ring}} usually has 5 or 6 atoms. [...] These forms are called furanoses and pyranoses, respectively— by analogy with furan and pyran, the {{simplest}} compounds {{with the same}} carbon-oxygen ring (although they lack the double bonds of these two molecules). [...] For example, the <b>aldohexose</b> glucose may form a hemiacetal linkage between the hydroxyl on carbon 1 and the oxygen on carbon 4, yielding a molecule with a 5-membered ring, called glucofuranose. [...] The same reaction can take place between carbons 1 and 5 to form a molecule with a 6-membered ring, called glucopyranose. Cyclic forms with a 7-atom ring (the same of oxepane), rarely encountered, are called heptoses.|$|E
2500|$|Each carbon atom {{bearing a}} {{hydroxyl}} group (-OH), {{with the exception}} of the first and last carbons, are asymmetric, making them stereo centers with two possible configurations each (R or S). Because of this asymmetry, a number of isomers may exist for any given monosaccharide formula. Using Le Bel-van't Hoff rule, the <b>aldohexose</b> D-glucose, for example, has the formula (C·H2O)6, of which four of its six carbons atoms are stereogenic, making D-glucose one of 24=16 possible stereoisomers. In the case of glyceraldehydes, an aldotriose, there is one pair of possible stereoisomers, which are enantiomers and epimers. 1, 3-dihydroxyacetone, the ketose corresponding to the aldose glyceraldehydes, is a symmetric molecule with no stereo centers. The assignment of D or L is made according to the orientation of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the carbonyl group: in a standard Fischer projection if the hydroxyl group is on the right the molecule is a D sugar, otherwise it is an L sugar. The [...] "D-" [...] and [...] "L-" [...] prefixes should not be confused with [...] "d-" [...] or [...] "l-", which indicate the direction that the sugar [...] rotates plane polarized light. This usage of [...] "d-" [...] and [...] "l-" [...] is no longer followed in carbohydrate chemistry.|$|E

5000|$|Aldoses, {{like all}} {{carbohydrates}} are categorized {{first by the}} presence of an aldehyde or a ketone on the carbon chain. They can be further differentiated by the number of carbons in the main chain using Greek prefixes. The minimum number of carbons in a backbone needed to form a molecule that is still considered a carbohydrate is 3, and carbohydrates with three carbons are called trioses. The only aldotriose is Glyceraldehyde, which has one chiral stereocenter with 2 possible enantiomers, D and L Glyceraldehyde. The most commonly discussed category of aldoses are those with 6 carbons, <b>aldohexoses.</b> Some <b>aldohexoses</b> that are widely called by common names are ...|$|R
50|$|In bio-organic chemistry, a hexose is a {{monosaccharide}} {{with six}} carbon atoms, having the chemical formula C6H12O6. Hexoses are classified by functional group, with <b>aldohexoses</b> having an aldehyde at position 1, and ketohexoses having a ketone at position 2.|$|R

The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glucose:NADP+ 1-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-linked <b>aldohexose,</b> dehydrogenase, NADP+-linked <b>aldohexose</b> dehydrogenase, NADP+-dependent glucose dehydrogenase, and glucose 1-dehydrogenase (NADP+).|$|E

5000|$|Mannose {{differs from}} glucose by {{inversion}} of the C-2 chiral center. Mannose displays a [...] pucker in the solution ring form.

40|$|The mass {{spectra of}} 18 {{trimethylsilyl}} disaccharides containing only <b>aldohexoses,</b> connected via all possible linkages (1 -> 1) to (1 -> 6), were compared. These spectra could {{be divided into}} three main groups: (1 -> 1) disaccharides, (1 -> 2), (1 -> 3), (1 -> 4) disaccharides and (1 -> 5), (1 -> 6) disaccharides. (1 -> 2), (1 -> 3) and (1 -> 4) disaccharides could be distinguished {{on the basis of}} two ratios of peak intensities. (1 -> 5) and (1 -> 6) disaccharides could not be distinguished. Also, the mass spectra of 4 trimethylsilyl trisaccharides built up from <b>aldohexoses</b> only were recorded. The spectra of three aldopentose containing disaccharides showed that the monosaccharide sequence as well as the position of the glycosidic link could be determined...|$|R
50|$|The anomeric centre in hemiacetals is the {{anomeric carbon}} C-1. In hemiketals {{it is the}} carbon derived from the {{carbonyl}} of the ketone (e.g. C-2 in D-fructose). In <b>aldohexoses</b> the anomeric reference atom is the stereocenter that is farthest from anomeric carbon in the ring (the configurational atom, defining the sugar as D or L). In α-D-glucopyranose the reference atom is C-5.|$|R
50|$|If the {{carbonyl}} is at {{the very}} beginning of the chain (carbon 1), the monosaccharide is said to be an aldose, otherwise it is a ketose. These names can be combined with the chain length prefix, as in <b>aldohexose</b> or ketopentose. Most ketoses found in nature have the carbonyl in position 2; when that is not the case, one uses a numeric prefix to indicate the carbonyl's position. Thus for example, <b>aldohexose</b> means H(C=O)(CHOH)5H, ketopentose means H(CHOH)(C=O)(CHOH)3H, and 3-ketopentose means H(CHOH)2(C=O)(CHOH)2H.|$|E
50|$|L-Glucose is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with formula C6H12O6 or H-(C=O)-(CHOH)5-H, specifically {{one of the}} <b>aldohexose</b> monosaccharides. As the L-isomer of glucose, it is the enantiomer of the more common D-glucose.|$|E
5000|$|Altrose is an <b>aldohexose</b> sugar. [...] D-Altrose is {{an unnatural}} monosaccharide. It is {{soluble in water}} and {{practically}} insoluble in methanol. However, L-altrose has been isolated from strains of the bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens.|$|E
50|$|For n = 3, {{there are}} eight stereoisomers. There are four pairs of enantiomers: R,R,R and S,S,S; R,R,S and S,S,R; R,S,S and S,R,R; and R,S,R and S,R,S. There are four {{diastereomer}}s, because each of the pairs of enantiomers is a diastereomer {{with respect to the}} other three. For n = 4, there are sixteen stereoisomers, or eight pairs of enantiomers. The four aldopentoses and the eight <b>aldohexoses</b> (subsets of the five- and six-carbon sugars) are examples of sets of compounds that differ in this way.|$|R

Separations of these aldoses were achieved using a 20 mM NaOH eluent. The elution behaviors of the aldoses were probably due to not only the individual pKa values, but also the chemical structures of the cyclic aldoses...|$|R

50|$|Though the cyclic {{forms of}} sugars are usually heavily favoured, hemiacetals in aqueous {{solution}} are in equilibrium with their open-chain forms. In <b>aldohexoses</b> this equilibrium is established as the hemiacetal bond between C-1 (the carbon bound to two oxygens) and C-5 oxygen is cleaved (forming the open-chain compound) and reformed (forming the cyclic compound). When the hemiacetal group is reformed, the OH group on C-5 may attack {{either of the two}} stereochemically distinct sides of the aldehyde group on C-1. Which side it attacks on determines whether the α or β anomer is formed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Nonracemic chiral 1 -lithio- 2 -alkenyl carbamates are {{generated}} by stereospecific deprotonation of optically active 2 -alkenyl carbamates, by kinetic resolution with sec-butyllithium/(-) -sparteine, or by preferential crystallisation {{of one of}} the diastereo-meric complexes.

50|$|The aldohexoses {{have four}} chiral centres {{for a total}} of 16 {{possible}} <b>aldohexose</b> stereoisomers (24).

50|$|The {{numbered}} carbons in the open-chain forms {{correspond to}} the same numbered carbons in the hemiacetal forms.

The open-chain form, however, does not crystallize. Hence the two cyclic forms become separable when they are crystallized.
