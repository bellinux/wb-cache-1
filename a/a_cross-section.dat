5|$|In {{the earlier}} stages of its development, the wing-bud is not {{provided}} with special organs of respiration such as tracheation, as it resembles {{in this respect}} the other portions of the hypodermis {{of which it is}} still a part. It should be noted, however, that the histoblast is developed near a large trachea, <b>a</b> <b>cross-section</b> of which is shown in, which represents sections of these parts of the first, second, third and fourth instars respectively. At the same time the tracheoles uncoil, and extend in bundles in the forming vein-cavities of the wing-bud. At the molt that marks the beginning of the pupal stadium stage, they become functional. At the same time, the larval tracheoles degenerate; their function having been replaced by the wing tracheae.|$|E
