From the first of its 900-odd pages, I knew, and my friends at the University of Sussex knew, that this was something else. We talked about it in the bar and on the bus and in the refectory queue.

500|$|On March 30, 2011, Sheindlin was {{admitted}} to the hospital after she fainted on the set of her show while handling a case. She was released the next day, and it was later learned that she suffered a mini-stroke. Regarding her retirement, Sheindlin has stated that it's up to her viewers and when they tire of watching the program, which she believes will inevitably happen one day. As of the present, however, Sheindlin has stated that fans still seem to be interested and taking something out of the court show. Sheindlin admits the court show is [...] "seductive" [...] and hard to give up. Sheindlin said, [...] "I'm not tired. I still feel engaged by what I do, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> people who like to watch it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Sheindlin {{appeared}} {{again on}} 60 Minutes on April 30, 2003. During the interview, Sheindlin stated:I have {{a contract with}} the company to do the program through the 2006 season. At that point, we will have produced this program for 10 years. Right now, I would be satisfied with a good 10-year run. I think that would really be phenomenal. It would be lovely if we could end on a high note and for me to say [...] "10 years <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> people watching <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had a second career that was a blast." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Until It Beats No More" [...] {{was used}} as an {{introduction}} to Lopez's performance at the American Music Awards on November 20, 2011. She wore a golden gown, with the words: [...] "Love... It's a journey <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> questions" [...] appearing in a screen behind her. Lopez began to break down, appearing as though she was about to cry. She then paused, looked up and shed most of her clothes for a performance of [...] "Papi". Critics noted the [...] "fake breakdown" [...] to be poking fun at her breakdown during her performance of the song at the Mohegan Sun casino a month earlier. The performance was compared to Britney Spears's music video for [...] "Toxic" [...] and Lopez's performance during the 2001 American Music Awards.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his early}} promise, Moore's {{parents had been}} against him {{training}} as a sculptor, a vocation they considered manual labour with few career prospects. After a brief introduction as a student teacher, Moore became {{a teacher at the}} school he had attended. Upon turning eighteen, Moore volunteered for army service. He was the youngest man in the Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles regiment and was injured in 1917 in a gas attack, on 30 November at Bourlon Wood, during the Battle of Cambrai. After recovering in hospital, he saw out the remainder of the war as a physical training instructor, only returning to France as the Armistice was signed. He recalled later, [...] "for me the war passed in a romantic haze of trying to be a hero." [...] This attitude changed as he reflected on the destructiveness of war and in 1940 he wrote, {{in a letter to his}} friend Arthur Sale, that [...] "a year or two after [...] the sight of a khaki uniform began to mean everything in life that was wrong and wasteful and anti-life. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> that feeling." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{point is}} that the charm of John Barleycorn was still a mystery to me. I was so {{organically}} a non-alcoholic that alcohol itself made no appeal; the chemical reactions it produced in me were not satisfying because I possessed no need for such chemical satisfaction. I drank because the men I was with drank, and because my nature was such that I could not permit myself to be less of a man than other men at their favourite pastime. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> a sweet tooth, and on privy occasions when there was no man to see, bought candy and blissfully devoured it.|$|R

500|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Tomarken asked Larson why {{he decided}} not to pass his {{remaining}} spins before he did, considering the lead he rapidly gained over Litras and Long. Side-stepping revealing how he had won the game, Larson responded with, [...] "Two things: one, it felt right, <b>and</b> second, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> seven spins <b>and</b> if <b>I</b> passed them, somebody could've done what I did." ...|$|R

60|$|You may be {{sure that}} she and I had words over this fiendish cruelty. When next we met I treated her as one who no longer existed, and at first she bridled and then was depressed, and as I was going away she burst into tears. She cried because neither at meeting nor parting had I lifted my hat to her, a foolish custom of mine, of which, as I now learned to my surprise, she was very proud. She <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> our tiffs, but I have never since then {{forgotten}} to lift my hat to Irene. I also made her promise to bow to me, at which she affected to scoff, saying I was taking my fun of her, but she was really pleased, and I tell you, Irene {{has one of the}} prettiest and most touching little bows imaginable; it is half to the side (if I may so express myself), which has always been my favourite bow, and, I doubt not, she acquired it by watching Mary.|$|E
60|$|My {{visit was}} {{in the heat of}} August, which is as fervid in Cambridge as it can well be anywhere, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> a sense of his study windows lifted to the summer night, and the crickets and {{grasshoppers}} crying in at them from the lawns and the gardens outside. Other people went away from Cambridge in the summer to the sea and to the mountains, but Lowell always stayed at Elmwood, in an impassioned love for his home and for his town. I must have found him there in the afternoon, and he must have made me sup with him (dinner was at two o'clock) and then go with him for a long night of talk in his study. He liked to have some one help him idle the time away, and keep him as long as possible from his work; and no doubt I was impersonally serving his turn in this way, aside from any pleasure he might have had in my company as some one he had always been kind to, and as a fresh arrival from the Italy dear to us both.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was dressed}} in his Sunday clothes, a sort of {{brownish}} tweeds, but the waistcoat was unbuttoned for greater comfort in his slumbers. He was a brown-eyed ruddy man, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> now in my mind the bright effect of the red-golden hairs that started out from his cheek to flow down into his beard. He was short but strongly built, and his beard and mustache were the biggest things about him. She had taken all the possibility of beauty he possessed, his clear skin, his bright hazel-brown eyes, and wedded them to a certain quickness she got from her mother. Her mother I remember as a sharp-eyed woman of great activity; she seems to me now to have been perpetually bringing in or taking out meals or doing some such service, and to me--for my mother's sake and my own--she was always welcoming and kind. Puss was a youngster of fourteen perhaps, of whom a hard bright stare, and a pale skin like her mother's, are the chief traces on my memory. All these people were very kind to me, and among them there was a common recognition, sometimes very agreeably finding expression, that I was--"clever." [...] They all stood about me {{as if they were}} a little at a loss.|$|E

5000|$|McCreary was {{interested}} in producing an organic sound using real instruments. This sort of opened up the floodgates for anything non-orchestral that <b>I</b> could find, <b>and</b> LA is a great town to find musicians who play unusual instruments. So it ultimately benefited the show, because I started writing for non-traditional instruments <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> to find ways for those instruments to speak musically {{the same way that}} an orchestral score would - meaning that the drama <b>still</b> <b>had</b> to be there; I just couldn’t use twenty-four horns and sixty strings - I had a couple of frame drums and a duduk! The irony is {{that by the end of}} the first season they were asking for some orchestra, and we were putting some orchestral strings back into the mix, but it was in a very different context. The strings, when they come up, suddenly sound special and unique, and when those episodes come up, I think viewers are subconsciously drawn to them because it sounds bigger, whereas if we plastered every episode with strings that effect would be lost.

6000|$|I am not sure, but I {{think it}} was through some volume which I found in his charge that I first came to know of De Quincey; {{he was fond of}} Dr. Holmes's poetry; he loved Whittier and Longfellow, each {{represented}} in his slender stock by some distinctive work. There were several stray volumes of Thackeray's minor writings, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> the 'Yellowplush Papers' in the smooth red cloth (now pretty well tattered) of Appleton's Popular Library, which I bought there. But most of the books were in the famous old brown cloth of Ticknor & Fields, which was a warrant of excellence in the literature it covered. Besides these there were standard volumes of poetry, published by Phillips & Sampson, from worn- out plates; for a birthday present my mother got me Wordsworth in this shape, and I am glad to think that I once read the [...] "Excursion" [...] in it, for I do not think I could do so now, and I have a feeling that it is very right and fit to have read the [...] "Excursion." [...] To be honest, it was very hard reading even then, and I cannot truthfully pretend that I have ever liked Wordsworth except in parts, though for the matter of that, I do not suppose that any one ever did. I tried hard enough to like everything in him, for I had already learned enough to know that I ought to like him, and that if I did not, it was a proof of intellectual and moral inferiority in me. My early idol, Pope, had already been tumbled into the dust by Lowell, whose lectures on English Poetry had lately been given in Boston, and had met with my rapturous acceptance in such newspaper report as I had of them. So, my preoccupations were all in favor of the Lake School, and it was both in my will and my conscience to like Wordsworth. If I did not do so it was not my fault, and the fault remains very much what it first was.|$|E
60|$|The {{instruction}} at Edinburgh was altogether by lectures, {{and these were}} intolerably dull, {{with the exception of}} those on chemistry by Hope; but to my mind there are no advantages and many disadvantages in lectures compared with reading. Dr. Duncan's lectures on Materia Medica at 8 o'clock on a winter's morning are something fearful to remember. Dr.---- made his lectures on human anatomy as dull as he was himself, and the subject disgusted me. It has proved one of the greatest evils in my life that I was not urged to practise dissection, for I should soon have got over my disgust; and the practice would have been invaluable for all my future work. This has been an irremediable evil, as well as my incapacity to draw. I also attended regularly the clinical wards in the hospital. Some of the cases distressed me a good deal, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> vivid pictures before me of some of them; but I was not so foolish as to allow this to lessen my attendance. I cannot understand why this part of my medical course did not interest me in a greater degree; for during the summer before coming to Edinburgh I began attending some of the poor people, chiefly children and women in Shrewsbury: I wrote down as full an account as I could of the case with all the symptoms, and read them aloud to my father, who suggested further inquiries and advised me what medicines to give, which I made up myself. At one time I had at least a dozen patients, and I felt a keen interest in the work. My father, who was by far the best judge of character whom I ever knew, declared that I should make a successful physician,--meaning by this one who would get many patients. He maintained that the chief element of success was exciting confidence; but what he saw in me which convinced him that I should create confidence I know not. I also attended on two occasions the operating theatre in the hospital at Edinburgh, and saw two very bad operations, one on a child, but I rushed away before they were completed. Nor did I ever attend again, for hardly any inducement would have been strong enough to make me do so; this being long before the blessed days of chloroform. The two cases fairly haunted me for many a long year.|$|E
