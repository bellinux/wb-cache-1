25|$|The Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment {{does not}} protect those {{serving in the}} armed forces, whether during wartime or peacetime.

Despite the fact that the whole Nazi movement lasted for little over 25 years (1919-1945) and the SS were founded only in 1923, awards of the 25-year version were made well before 25 years of <b>actual</b> <b>service</b> were completed. This was because the period between 1925 and 1933 (what the Nazis termed Kampfzeit ("Time of Struggle") counted double, and any service in the Armed Forces in the First World War and afterwards, as well as the Police, was also included.

During <b>actual</b> <b>service,</b> especially at war, the ships were kept fully loaded whenever possible, rendering her belt armor almost useless. That this was not considered in the design outraged the Walker policy board–convened in 1896 to evaluate the existing American battleships and propose a design for the new s–and they set a standard that the load of coal and ammunition that future ships were designed for had to be at least two-thirds of the maximum, so similar problems would be prevented in new ships.|$|E
30|$|The {{main reason}} for {{dividing}} service refinement into four phases is to provide separation of concerns. It creates independence between phases when designing a new service. Service description, process, and policies may even be created by different people or by different intelligent systems, regardless of the <b>actual</b> <b>services</b> that will implement the external functions. By dividing a service refinement into pieces, we can expect service creation (manual or automated) to become easier.|$|R
