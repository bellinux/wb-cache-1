5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, the large cent (<b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> half dollar) being {{issued by the}} Mint was {{becoming}} both unpopular in commerce and expensive to coin. After experimenting with various sizes and compositions, the Mint decided on an alloy of 88% copper and 12% nickel for a new, smaller cent. After the Mint produced patterns with an 1856 date and gave them to legislators and officials, Congress formally authorized the new piece in February 1857.|$|E
5|$|Crickets are hemimetabolic insects, whose {{lifecycle}} {{consists of}} an egg stage, a larval or nymph stage that increasingly resembles the adult form as the nymph grows, and an adult stage. The egg hatches into a nymph <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fruit fly. This passes through about 10 larval stages, and with each successive moult, it becomes more like an adult. After the final moult, the genitalia and wings are fully developed, but a period of maturation is needed before the cricket is ready to breed.|$|E
5|$|Permanent brachytherapy, {{also known}} as seed implantation, {{involves}} placing small LDR radioactive seeds or pellets (<b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> grain of rice) in the tumour or treatment site and leaving them there permanently to gradually decay. Over a period of weeks or months, the level of radiation emitted by the sources will decline to almost zero. The inactive seeds then remain in the treatment site with no lasting effect. Permanent brachytherapy is most commonly used {{in the treatment of}} prostate cancer.|$|E

5|$|<b>About</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rabbit, the tammar {{is among}} the {{smallest}} of the wallabies in the genus Macropus. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, colour vision and the ability to drink seawater. A nocturnal species, it spends nighttime in grassland habitat and daytime in shrubland. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its genome sequenced.|$|E
5|$|Another Tyrannosaurus, nicknamed Stan, {{in honor}} of amateur {{paleontologist}} Stan Sacrison, {{was found in the}} Hell Creek Formation near Buffalo, South Dakota, in the spring of 1987. It was not collected until 1992, as it was mistakenly thought to be a Triceratops skeleton. Stan is 63% complete and is on display in the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in Hill City, South Dakota, after an extensive world tour during 1995 and 1996. This tyrannosaur, too, was found to have many bone pathologies, including broken and healed ribs, a broken (and healed) neck and a spectacular hole in the back of its head, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Tyrannosaurus tooth.|$|E
5|$|The Mint's chief engraver, James B. Longacre, was {{instructed}} to prepare designs for pattern coins. Initially, Longacre worked with Liberty head designs such as were common at the time, but Snowden asked that a flying eagle design be prepared. This occurred as Booth's experiments continued; the first cent patterns with the flying eagle design were <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quarter. To promote the new alloy, the Mint had 50 half cents struck in it, and had them sent to Washington for Treasury officials to show to officials and congressmen. In early November 1856, Longacre prepared dies in what {{would prove to be}} the final design, depicting a flying eagle on the obverse and a wreathed denomination on the reverse, in the size sought by Booth.|$|E

5|$|The cent was {{the first}} {{official}} United States coin to be struck at the Philadelphia Mint in 1793. These pieces, today known as large cents, were made of pure copper and were <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> half dollar. They were struck every year, except 1815 due to a shortage of metal, but were slow to become established in commerce. Worn Spanish colonial silver pieces were then commonly used as money throughout the United States. At the time, both gold and silver were legal tender there, but copper coins were not; {{the federal government would}} not redeem them or take them in payment of taxes.|$|E
5|$|The folk worship {{representation}} of Shashthi is a red-coloured stone <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human head, typically placed beneath a banyan tree {{such as those}} usually found {{on the outskirts of}} villages. The banyan may be decorated with flowers or strewn with rice and other offerings. Shashthi is also commonly represented by planting a banyan tree or a small branch in the soil of a family's home garden. Other common representations of the goddess include a Shaligrama stone, an earthen water pitcher, or a Purna Ghata – a water vase with an arrangement of coconut and mango leaves – generally set beneath a banyan tree.|$|E
5|$|Salt mining: Ancient China {{was among}} the {{earliest}} civilizations {{in the world with}} cultivation and trade of salt mining. They first discovered natural gas when they excavated rock salt as the Chinese writer, poet, and politician Zhang Hua of the Jin Dynasty wrote in his book Bowuzhi how people in Zigong, Sichuan excavated natural gas and used it to boil a rock salt solution. The ancient Chinese gradually mastered and advanced the techniques of producing salt. Salt mining was an arduous task for the ancient Chinese, where they faced geographical and technological constraints. Salt was mainly extracted from the sea and salt works in the coastal areas in late imperial China equated to more than 80 percent of national production. In conjunction to this, the Chinese made use of natural crystallization of salt lakes and constructed some artificial evaporation basins close to the shores. In 1041, during the medieval Song dynasty, the Chinese drilled a well with a diameter <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bowl and several dozen feet deep was drilled for salt production. In Southwestern China, natural salt deposits were mined with bores that could reach to a depth of more than 1000 meters but the yields of ground and salt were relatively low. As salt was a necessity of life for human civilization, salt mining played a pivotal role {{as one of the most}} important sources of Imperial Chinese government revenue and state development.|$|E
