5|$|There are few data on comorbid {{conditions}}, {{but there}} are some conditions that arise in the same circumstances in which RAD arises, such as institutionalization or maltreatment. These are principally developmental delays and language disorders associated with neglect. Conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD. Attachment disorder behaviors amongst institutionalized children are correlated with attentional and conduct problems and cognitive levels but nonetheless appear to index a distinct set of symptoms <b>and</b> <b>behaviors.</b>|$|E

5|$|A notable recent {{development}} in Philosophy of Psychology is Functional Contextualism or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism {{is a modern}} philosophy of science rooted in philosophical pragmatism and contextualism. It is most actively developed in behavioral science in general, the field of behavior analysis, and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science). Functional contextualism serves {{as the basis of}} a theory of language known as relational frame theory and its most prominent application, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism first delineated by Steven C. Hayes which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, <b>and</b> <b>behaviors)</b> with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.|$|E
5|$|Locomotor {{behavior}} in lemurs, both living and extinct, is highly varied and its diversity exceeds that of anthropoids. Locomotor postures <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> have included vertical clinging and leaping (including saltatory behavior), seen in indriids and bamboo lemurs; slow (loris-like) arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by Mesopropithecus; fast arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, seen in true lemurs and ruffed lemurs; partially terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, {{seen in the}} ring-tailed lemur; highly terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by monkey lemurs such as Hadropithecus; and sloth-like suspensory locomotion, once exhibited {{by many of the}} sloth lemurs, such as Palaeopropithecus. The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis) has even been reported to be a good swimmer. Sometimes these locomotor types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs, the vertical clingers and leapers and the arboreal (and occasionally terrestrial) quadrupeds.|$|E
5|$|No {{medications}} directly {{treat the}} core symptoms of AS. Although {{research into the}} efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention for AS is limited, {{it is essential to}} diagnose and treat comorbid conditions. Deficits in self-identifying emotions or in observing effects of one's behavior on others can make it difficult for individuals with AS to see why medication may be appropriate. Medication can be effective in combination with behavioral interventions and environmental accommodations in treating comorbid symptoms such as anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, inattention and aggression. The atypical antipsychotic medications risperidone and olanzapine have been shown to reduce the associated symptoms of AS; risperidone can reduce repetitive and self-injurious behaviors, aggressive outbursts and impulsivity, and improve stereotypical patterns of behavior and social relatedness. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline have been effective in treating restricted and repetitive interests <b>and</b> <b>behaviors.</b>|$|E

For this analysis the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants in order to obtain statistically significant results. Considered in isolation, bupropion was not statistically different from placebo.|$|E
5|$|The {{batteries}} in OR–7's Global Positioning System tracking unit expired in October 2015. Officials decided {{to replace the}} collar {{in order to keep}} track of the pack, which is protected under Oregon law and the federal Endangered Species Act. However, attempts to trap OR-7 or other members of the pack failed, and further tracking of OR-7 depended on trail cameras and live sightings. A trail camera in the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest captured an image of OR-7 and one of his offspring in early 2016. After four steers were killed by wolves in Wood River Valley in western Klamath County (immediately east of Jackson County) near where OR–7 was last seen, biologists said efforts to trap and re-collar the wolf would likely resume and that tracking could alert ranchers concerned about their livestock. On October 3, 2017, biologists caught and collared OR-54, another Rogue Pack wolf, thought to be OR-7's daughter, traveling with the pack in Wood River Valley. In lieu of another tracking device on OR-7, the collar on OR-54 will allow officials to track the movements <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> of the pack.|$|E

25|$|Groups are {{important}} {{not only because they}} offer social support, resources, and a feeling of belonging, but because they supplement an individual's self-concept. To a large extent, humans define themselves by the group memberships which form their social identity. The shared social identity of individuals within a group influences intergroup behavior, the way in which groups behave towards and perceive each other. These perceptions <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> in turn define the social identity of individuals within the interacting groups. The tendency to define oneself by membership in a group may lead to intergroup discrimination, which involves favorable perceptions <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> directed towards the in-group, but negative perceptions <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> directed towards the out-group. On the other hand, such discrimination and segregation may sometimes exist partly to facilitate a diversity which strengthens society. Intergroup discrimination leads to prejudice and stereotyping, while the processes of social facilitation and group polarization encourage extreme behaviors towards the out-group.|$|E

40|$|For both {{survival}} and procreation, animals must facilitate behavior {{that results in}} beneficial outcomes, <b>and</b> inhibit <b>behavior</b> that results in harmful outcomes. Inherent to this process {{is the ability of}} animals to predict probable outcomes that are associated with stimuli <b>and</b> <b>behavior.</b> Neurons in reward-related brain structures respond to stimuli <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> in a manner that reflects the probable outcomes that are associated with those stimuli <b>and</b> <b>behavior.</b> Although these responses have been characterized in prior research, one issue has received relatively little attention: Outcomes depend on more than stimuli <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> alone. Outcomes also depend on long-lasting aspects of the animals state, including context, physiological states, and emotional states. It is not clear how such state-dependent information is represented in reward circuitry. The main focus of this thesis was to investigate this issue. We demonstrate that neurons exhibit long-lasting changes in average firing rate that can be sufficient for representing state-dependent information. In addition, we report that these changes in average firing rate can act as a gain control to modulate the magnitude of neural responses to stimuli <b>and</b> <b>behavior.</b> In this way, individual neurons can both represent state-dependent information, and use this information to modulate representations of outcomes associated with stimuli <b>and</b> <b>behavior.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} indicates {{the necessity of}} investigating different moderators on the relation between sleep duration <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> problems. Goal: Present study examines the influence of temperament (effort control, negative affectivity, affiliativeness and extraversion) as a moderator on the relation between sleep duration <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> problems, both internalizing and externalizing. Methods: 486 questionnaires have been completed. Mean age of the children was 10. 49 (SD= 0. 97). Parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ: Goodman, 2001), the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire-Revised (EATQ-R: Muris & Meesters, 2009) and filled out a sleep diary. Results: There were no significant correlations between the interactions sleep duration <b>and</b> temperament <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> problems. Temperament did not act as a moderator on the correlation between sleep duration <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> problems. Between effort control and extraversion <b>and</b> internalizing <b>behavior</b> problems {{there was a significant}} negative correlation. Between negative affectivity <b>and</b> internalizing <b>behavior</b> problems the relation was positive. Externalizing behavior problems had a significant negative relation with effort control and a positive significant relation with negative affectivity.
