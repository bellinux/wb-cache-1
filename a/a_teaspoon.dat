5|$|Viruses are {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entity in aquatic environments—there are about one million of them in <b>a</b> <b>teaspoon</b> of seawater—and they {{are essential to the}} regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems. Most of these viruses are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals. They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities and {{this is the most important}} mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine environment. The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by the viruses stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>teaspoon</b> of {{seawater}} {{contains about}} 50 million viruses. Most {{of these are}} bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals, and are in fact essential to the regulation of marine and freshwater ecosystems; however, they are also important mortality agents of phytoplankton, {{the base of the}} foodchain in aquatic environments. They infect and destroy bacteria in aquatic microbial communities, and {{are one of the most}} important mechanisms of recycling carbon and nutrient cycling in marine environments. The organic molecules released from the dead bacterial cells stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth, in a process known as the viral shunt. Viral activity may also affect the biological pump, the process whereby carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean.|$|E

25|$|For babies a dropper or syringe {{without the}} needle {{can be used}} to put small amounts of fluid into the mouth; for {{children}} under 2, <b>a</b> <b>teaspoon</b> every one to two minutes; and for older children and adults, frequent sips directly from a cup. After the first two hours, rehydration should be continued at the same or slower rate, determined by how much fluid the child wants and any ongoing diarrheal loses.

50|$|If {{a recipe}} calls for <b>a</b> level <b>teaspoon</b> of <b>a</b> dry {{ingredient}} (salt, flour, etc.), this {{refers to an}} approximately leveled filling of the spoon, producing the same volume as for liquids. <b>A</b> rounded <b>teaspoon</b> is <b>a</b> larger but less precise measure, produced without leveling the ingredient off or heaping it as high as possible. A heaping or heaped <b>teaspoon</b> is <b>a</b> larger inexact measure consisting of the amount obtained by scooping the dry ingredient up without leveling it off. For some ingredients, e.g. flour, this quantity can vary considerably.|$|R

He often thought that the dream of {{becoming}} a doctor could have first been formed at the age of eight when his family was involved in an epidemic of scarlet fever. He remembered being taken to spend a few days with the family doctor, Mr. Brett, and one morning at breakfast he startled his family by repeating a procedure that the doctor had used during his illness. Pouring a little tea onto <b>a</b> <b>teaspoon,</b> he had heated it over an oil lamp and carefully inspected the result, checking the tea for albumin as Mr. Brett had done with his urine.|$|E
2500|$|Oral {{rehydration}} solution (ORS) (a slightly sweetened {{and salty}} water) {{can be used}} to prevent dehydration. Standard home solutions such as salted rice water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given. Home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green coconut water, weak tea (unsweetened), and unsweetened fresh fruit juices can have from half <b>a</b> <b>teaspoon</b> to full teaspoon of salt (from one-and-a-half to three grams) added per liter. Clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given. There are commercial solutions such as Pedialyte, and relief agencies such as UNICEF widely distribute packets of salts and sugar. A WHO publication for physicians recommends a homemade ORS consisting of one liter water with one teaspoon salt (3 grams) and two tablespoons sugar (18 grams) added (approximately the [...] "taste of tears"). Rehydration Project recommends adding the same amount of sugar but only one-half <b>a</b> <b>teaspoon</b> of salt, stating that this more dilute approach is less risky with very little loss of effectiveness. Both agree that drinks with too much sugar or salt can make dehydration worse.|$|E

2500|$|The {{kilogram}} is dissimilar to {{the other}} SI base units {{in that it is}} expressed as a multiple of another unit (the gram) with a multiplier prefix ("kilo") added to it. <b>A</b> <b>teaspoon</b> holds about 5grams of sugar which makes milligrams or in some case micrograms convenient units to measure medicine doses when they are dispensed in capsules. The ton, variously defined, had long been a customary unit of measure for large masses and in the mid-nineteenth century the metric ton (or tonne) of 1000kg (i.e. equivalent to the megagram) was introduced. [...] Although the tonne is not an SI Unit, its continued use in many countries has led to it being [...] "accepted for use within SI".|$|E

2500|$|Efamol {{continued}} to ship EPO into the United States and to market its products. In a 1989 article on [...] "health food frauds", the New York Times {{reported on the}} FDA's seizure of [...] "more than $1 million worth" [...] of illegal EPO. The FDA again accused Efamol of marketing the oil [...] "with unsubstantiated claims of treating {{a wide variety of}} illnesses". [...] Efamol's lawyers responded that the product was not dangerous and that it had not made unsubstantiated claims. The American Dietetic Association, representing over 50,000 nutritionists, questioned the value of Horrobin's product since [...] "one-tenth of <b>a</b> <b>teaspoon</b> of ordinary corn oil has as much of the fatty acids as a capsule of Evening Primrose Oil, {{at a fraction of the}} cost". In 1989, the FDA commissioned a report by investigator Stephen Barrett, a medical doctor and consumer protection advocate. Barrett advised the FDA that Horrobin's marketing of Efamol was done in [...] "a transparent attempt to evade the food and drug laws". In a report on the incident published by the consumer information organisation Quackwatch, Barrett also questions Horrobin's research ethics: [...] "Would someone that contemptuous of the law have any qualms about faking data?" ...|$|E
