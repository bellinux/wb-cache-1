In the Autun Basin, explosive eruptions, expressed as highly weathered distal ashfall deposits (tonsteins), were preserved in lacustrine to swamp environments. The analysis of eleven tonsteins, confirmed as non-reworked volcanic horizons, indicates a highly explosive acidic calc-alkaline volcanism, with active volcanic centres probably linked to Massif Central or Vosges–Black Forest magmatism. New accurate CA-ID-TIMS U–Pb ages are obtained from four of these tonsteins, recorded within the lower Autunian (Igornay and Muse Fms), which defines {{the lower part of}} the Autunian stratotype in the Autun Basin. The middle part of the Igornay Fm is dated at 299. 9 ± 0. 38 Ma, the Lally oil-shale bed is dated at 298. 91 ± 0. 08 Ma and the upper part of the Muse oil-shale bed is dated between 298. 05 ± 0. 19 and 298. 57 ± 0. 16 Ma. For the first time, a numerical calibration of the regional continental <b>Autunian</b> <b>stage</b> in its stratotype is proposed, thus allowing correlation with global marine stages defined in the Urals, and highlighting a late Gzhelian/early Asselian age for the lower Autunian. The tonstein in the Lally oil-shale appears to demarcate the Carboniferous–Permian boundary within the ± 100 kyr resolution of the U-Pb ages in both the Autun and southern Uralian basins. Comparison with other European domains confirms that these new ages are consistent with well-known macrofloral assemblages, characteristic of the Autunian...|$|E
