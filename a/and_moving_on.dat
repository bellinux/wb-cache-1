5|$|In 1950, Perseus {{was fitted}} with an {{experimental}} steam catapult. The catapult {{was placed on}} top of the carrier's existing flight deck and the deckhouse to port of the island was removed to accommodate it. Some 1,560 launches were made by the catapult, beginning with over 1,000 wheeled dead-loads, of gradually increasing weight, <b>and</b> <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> to with unmanned aircraft with their wings truncated to reduce their ability to glide. The final tests were made by manned aircraft of every type flown by the Fleet Air Arm. After this, the ship arrived in Philadelphia on 14 January 1952 to demonstrate the catapult to the United States Navy. Between them, some 127 launches of manned aircraft were made by the British and the Americans. Perseus arrived back at Portsmouth on 21 March and had the catapult removed. All of her remaining maintenance equipment was removed and she was converted for use as a ferry carrier.|$|E

25|$|Very tall {{buildings}} ("skyscrapers"), when built using modern lightweight materials, might sway uncomfortably (but not dangerously) in certain wind conditions. A {{solution to this}} problem is to include at some upper story a large mass, constrained, but free to move within a limited range, <b>and</b> <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> some sort of bearing system such as an air cushion or hydraulic film. Hydraulic pistons, powered by electric pumps and accumulators, are actively driven to counter the wind forces and natural resonances. These may also, if properly designed, be effective in controlling excessive motion – with or without applied power – in an earthquake. In general, though, modern steel frame high rise buildings are not as subject to dangerous motion as are medium rise (eight to ten story) buildings, as the resonant period of a tall and massive building is longer than the approximately one second shocks applied by an earthquake.|$|E

He then went on to Cup of Russia and took the gold medal there, as well. The two first-place finishes secured him a spot at the 2007–2008 Grand Prix Final, where Weir competed with a recurring injury in his landing foot and stumbled in both his short and long programs but still managed to place 4th overall.|$|E

In addition, students in the Honors Program exclusively can live in a Living-Learning Community housed in West Villages C and F.

He also noted that some instrumentals on the album [...] " [...] to be so out of time or step with a traditional hip-hop direction". The A.V.

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 21st century, Beiderbecke's music continued to reside mostly out of the mainstream and some of the facts of his life are still debated, but scholars largely agree—due in part to the influence of Sudhalter and Evans—that he was an important innovator in early jazz; jazz cornetists, including Sudhalter (before his death in 2008), and Tom Pletcher, closely emulate his style. In 2003, to mark the hundredth anniversary of his birth, the Greater Astoria Historical Society and other community organizations, spearheaded by Paul Maringelli and The Bix Beiderbecke Sunnyside Memorial Committee, erected a plaque in Beiderbecke's honor at the apartment building in which he died in Queens. That same year, Frederick Turner published his novel 1929, which followed the facts of Beiderbecke's life fairly closely, focusing on his summer in Hollywood and featuring appearances by Al Capone and Clara Bow. The critic and musician Digby Fairweather sums up Beiderbecke's musical legacy, arguing that [...] "with Louis Armstrong, Bix Beiderbecke was the most striking of jazz's cornet (and of course, trumpet) fathers; a player who first captivated his 1920s generation and after his premature death, founded a dynasty of distinguished followers beginning with Jimmy McPartland <b>and</b> <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> down from there." ...|$|E
500|$|Invisible War {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2072, twenty years after the events of the {{original}} Deus Ex; the Deus Ex series is set in a cyberpunk future rife with secret organizations and conspiracies such as the Illuminati and Majestic 12, an Illuminati splinter faction. During the first game's events in 2052, original protagonist JC Denton—a clone designed to serve Majestic 12—was drawn into a secret war between the Illuminati and Majestic 12, led by industrialist Bob Page. Page intended to make himself a global dictator by first undermining the Illuminati by creating a pandemic to blackmail the world's elite into supporting Majestic 12, then merging himself with the artificial intelligence (AI) Helios. In the canon leading up to Invisible War. a combination of all three endings of Deus Ex took place; JC kills Majestic 12 leader Bob Page, merges with Helios, destroys Majestic 12's base in Area 51 to cripple the world communication network, then sides with the Illuminati to rebuild the world in the wake of these events. JC's actions triggered a worldwide period of war and depression dubbed the [...] "Collapse". Following the Collapse, major capitals organize themselves into city states, creating walled enclaves where the population can be watched and expansion is closely controlled. The story moves between a variety of locations across the world, starting in Seattle <b>and</b> <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> to Cairo, Trier and Antarctica.

The song {{tells the story}} of two teenagers meeting a rock concert, and, despite failing grades and disapproving parents, falling and staying in love. It was inspired by the band's early days in San Diego's all-ages venue SOMA. [...] "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] follows and is written about divorce {{from the point of view}} of a helpless child. Inspired by DeLonge's parents' divorce, it is one of the band's darker songs. [...] "Roller Coaster" [...] was written when Hoppus had a nightmare when he and his wife, Skye, first began dating; the song is about finding something ideal but fearing for its certain departure. [...] "Reckless Abandon" [...] was penned by DeLonge as a reflection on summer memories, including parties, skateboarding and trips to the beach. [...] "Everytime I Look for You" [...] has no specific lyrical basis, according to Hoppus, and [...] "Give Me One Good Reason" [...] was written about punk music and nonconformity in a high school setting. [...] "Shut Up", a [...] "broken-family snapshot", revisits the territory of youthful woes, described by Shooman as a [...] "fairly familiar rites-of-passage tale" [...] that [...] "adds to general themes of isolation, alienation <b>and</b> <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> to a new place that pervade Take Off Your Pants and Jacket". [...] "Please Take Me Home" [...] concludes the standard edition of the album and was written about the consequences of a friendship developing into a relationship.|$|E
