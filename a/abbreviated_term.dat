40|$|The use of {{abbreviations}} for {{the names of}} polymers is practical and economic in written and spoken language. Taking into consideration the several hundreds of polymers appearing in literature annually, some of them having complicated structures, {{it is almost impossible}} to derive a systematic and unique abbreviation to polymer structures. Therefore, IUPAC has taken over the well-established ISO list of <b>abbreviated</b> <b>terms</b> (about 120 items) mainly selected on the basis of the scale of production. The presented ISO nomenclature is not necessarily in accord with IUPAC recommendations...|$|R

25|$|The widespread, {{frequent}} use of acronyms across {{the whole range of}} registers is a relatively new linguistic phenomenon in most languages, becoming increasingly evident since the mid-20th century. As literacy rates rose, and as advances in science and technology brought with them a constant stream of new (and sometimes more complex) terms and concepts, the practice of <b>abbreviating</b> <b>terms</b> became increasingly convenient. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) records the first printed use of the word initialism as occurring in 1899, but it did not come into general use until 1965, well after acronym had become common.|$|R

Exceptions {{are made}} when the <b>abbreviated</b> <b>term</b> has become {{established as a}} word in its own right, as in chūzhōng (...) for chūjí zhōngxué ( [...] , junior high school). Abbreviations of proper-name compounds, however, should always be hyphenated: Běijīng Dàxué ( [...] , Peking University) → Běi-Dà ( [...] , PKU).|$|E
40|$|Faculty {{members and}} administrators often believe that courses taught during <b>abbreviated</b> <b>terms</b> are less {{effective}} than the same courses taught during a full-length academic term. One much cited reason, per Anastasi, which also has some support in the research, is that recall is often superior when “learning trials are spaced rather than massed” (p. 19); that is, when course content is acquired {{over a longer period}} of time, such as a full semester, students remember more of it. Anastasi put this belief to the test by comparing the academic performance in and teaching evaluations for equivalent full-semester and summer sections of three different psychology courses, Effective Thinking, Memory and Cognition, an...|$|R

50|$|The {{name comes}} from having {{a quarter of the}} 640×480 maximum {{resolution}} of the original IBM VGA display technology, which became a de facto industry standard in the late 1980s. QVGA is not a standard mode offered by the VGA BIOS, even though VGA and compatible chipsets support a QVGA-sized Mode X. The term refers only to the display's resolution and thus the <b>abbreviated</b> <b>term</b> QVGA or Quarter VGA is more appropriate to use.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} a robust approach for <b>abbreviating</b> <b>terms.</b> First, {{in order to}} incorporate non-local information into abbreviation generation tasks, we present both implicit and explicit solutions: the latent variable model, or alternatively, the label encoding approach with global information. Although the two approaches compete with one another, we demonstrate that these approaches are also complementary. By combining these two approaches, experiments revealed that the proposed abbreviation generator achieved the best results for both the Chinese and English languages. Moreover, we directly apply our generator to perform a very different task from tradition, the abbreviation recognition. Experiments revealed that the proposed model worked robustly, and outperformed five out of six state-of-the-art abbreviation recognizers. ...|$|R
40|$|Acronyms are {{abbreviations}} {{made up of}} {{the first}} letters of several words. They replace longer terms with simpler ones. In the English language, the widespread use of acronyms and initialisms is a relatively new linguistic phenomenon. As literacy rose, and as advances in science and technology brought with them more complicated terms and concepts, the practice of <b>abbreviating</b> <b>terms</b> became increasingly convenient. In business, industry, education, and government, acronyms and initialisms are often used by people working within the same fields. However, such abbreviations may not be comprehensible to those outside the field. Certain abbreviations can mean different things to different people. The paper is also trying to provide an insightful analysis of some of the acronyms and initialism used in business English...|$|R
50|$|Written Japanese in general, {{and news}} writing in particular, places a strong {{emphasis}} on brevity, and features heavy use of Sino-Japanese vocabulary and omission of grammar that would be used in speech. Most frequently, two-character kanji compounds are used to concisely express concepts that would otherwise require a lengthy clause if using spoken language. Nominalization is also common, often compacting a phrase into a string of kanji. Abbreviations are also frequent, reducing a term or kanji compound to just initial characters (as in acronyms in alphabetic writing systems); these <b>abbreviated</b> <b>terms</b> might not be used in spoken language, but are understandable from looking at the characters in context. Furthermore, headlines are written in telegram style, yielding clipped phrases that are not grammatical sentences. Larger articles, especially front-page articles, also often have a one-paragraph summary at the beginning.|$|R
