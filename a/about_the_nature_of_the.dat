5|$|A strong squall {{swept across}} Matagorda Bay in southeastern Texas on June 27. High winds ripped a ship from its anchor and drove it aground, {{and at least}} one other vessel {{suffered}} structural damage. Although it is included in the Weather Prediction Center's publication, Texas Hurricane History, little is known <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm.|$|E

40|$|Curriculum {{designers}} in both Pakistan and the UK {{accept that}} science education for today’s young {{people should not}} just be about learning science, it should also include learning <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> science. However, together with other research evidence, this article suggests that for many science teachers, teaching <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> science might be problematic as {{they do not have}} the necessary understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> science themselves. This article also argues that there are benefits in teachers across cultural divides sharing their understandings <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> science...|$|R
5|$|At a music festival, Sunny is embarrassed when Ringo and Declan Napier (James Sorensen) {{interrupt}} a kiss {{between her}} and Zeke. She runs off into the bush, falls down a cliff and injures her ankle. Zeke also falls down the cliff, they are eventually rescued by Declan and Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major). Karl and Susan call Sunny's parents and learn that they know nothing about the festival or Zeke. Sunny's parents demand that she {{is placed on the}} next flight home. However, Zeke moves out, so Sunny's parents will not worry about them having a relationship. Zeke later moves back home and Karl asks Sunny to call her father and translate for him. Sunny lies to her father <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conversation and tells him that her father said everything is fine.|$|E
5|$|Calls {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} purposes, {{including}} mate attraction, evaluation of potential mates, bond formation, the claiming and maintenance of territories, the identification of other individuals (such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season), and the warning of other birds of potential predators, sometimes with specific information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> threat. Some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication. The Coenocorypha snipes of New Zealand drive air through their feathers, woodpeckers drum territorially, and palm cockatoos use tools to drum.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{discovery}} of many hundreds of Iron Age sites in Scotland {{there is still a}} great deal that remains to be explained <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Celtic life in the early Christian era. Unfortunately radiocarbon dating for this period is problematic and chronological sequences are poorly understood. For a variety of reasons much of the archaeological work to date in Scotland has concentrated on the islands of the west and north and both excavations and analysis of societal structures on the mainland are more limited in scope.|$|E

5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{visited the}} set {{frequently}} during filming. Members {{of the main}} cast approached Stillwell with questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> altered universe, trying {{to determine if they}} were still playing the same characters. Goldberg asked Ganino about changing a piece of dialogue on set, but since Ganino was not the author of the teleplay, he deferred to Stillwell, who in turn notified the production office. When Berman found out that Ganino and Stillwell were on set and talking to the actors, he banned them from setting foot on the sets again.|$|E
5|$|Many rodent species, {{particularly}} those that are diurnal and social, have {{a wide range of}} alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action. Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> precise threat. The urgency of the threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call.|$|E

At the helicopter, Kate, Sayid, and the Others free Ben by ambushing and killing the mercenaries, except Keamy, who feigns death. In return, the Others allow Kate, Sayid and the other survivors to leave the island on the helicopter. Ben returns to the Orchid, where he gets in a hidden elevator with Locke.|$|E

5|$|The Edwardian castles {{also made}} strong {{symbolic}} statements <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new occupation. For example, Caernarvon {{was decorated with}} carved eagles, equipped with polygonal towers and expensive banded masonry, all designed to imitate the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, then the idealised image of imperial power. The actual site of the castle {{may also have been}} important as it was positioned close to the former Roman fort of Segontium. The elaborate gatehouse, with an excessive five sets of doors and six portcullises, also appears to have been designed to impress visitors and to invoke an image of an Arthurian castle, then believed to have been Byzantine in character.|$|E
5|$|These {{excavations}} {{have yielded}} different varieties of ceramics such as {{black and red}} ware, rouletted ware and Russet coated ware, both locally made and imported kinds. Many of the pottery sherds contain Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions on them, which have provided additional evidence for the archaeologist to date them. Other artifacts such as brick walls, ring wells, pits, industrial items, remains of seeds and shells provide clues <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> settlements and the other aspects of life during the Sangam age. Archaeologists agree that activities best illustrated in the material records of Tamilakam are trade, hunting, agriculture and crafts.|$|E
5|$|While {{it was a}} {{minority}} view in the 1960s, eliminative materialism gained prominence and acceptance during the 1980s. Proponents of this view, such as B.F. Skinner, often made parallels to previous pseudoscientific theories (such {{as that of the}} four humours, the phlogiston theory of combustion, and the vital force theory of life) that have all been successfully eliminated in attempting to establish their thesis <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mental. In these cases, science has not produced more detailed versions or reductions of these theories, but rejected them altogether as obsolete. Radical behaviorists, such as Skinner, argued that folk psychology is already obsolete and should be replaced by descriptions of histories of reinforcement and punishment. Such views were eventually abandoned. Patricia and Paul Churchland argued that folk psychology will be gradually replaced as neuroscience matures.|$|E

5|$|Zajdel's early works, from 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, focuses on {{scientific}} inventions {{and their role}} in space exploration, alien contact or artificial intelligence. As his writing career continued, however, his stories evolved {{to focus on the}} social aspects and often negative consequences of those inventions. Over time, an increasingly visible theme became visible in his works - a concern over dangers inherent in attempts to control the human society. He is also condemning human ignorance, warning against xenophobia, and asking philosophical questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe, happiness and human destiny. Zajdel's works from his second period - late 1970s and 1980s - and represent the genres of social and dystopian fiction. In his works, he envisions totalitarian states and societies leaving under extreme forms of mass surveillance.|$|E
5|$|After {{the player}} defeats the Elite Four {{and enters the}} Champion's chamber, he or she finds that N has {{defeated}} Alder and become the newest Pokémon Champion. Soon after, he summons a large castle that surrounds the Pokémon League, challenging the player to find him {{to take part in}} one final battle. When the player finally reaches him, Reshiram in Black or Zekrom in White appears before the player, and the player must capture the legendary Pokémon before challenging N. After his defeat, N laments the possibility that his ideals are mistaken, Ghetsis intrudes and angrily reveals that his true intentions were to use N to ensure that he would be the only human left with control over Pokémon and use them to rule the world. In his rage, Ghetsis challenges the player to battle. After Ghetsis's defeat, he is arrested, allowing Alder to resume his position as the Pokémon Champion of the Unova region. N then thanks the player for helping realize his mistake <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship between people and their Pokémon before leaving the castle on his captured Pokémon to a far-off land.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} faint {{luminosity}} of this galaxy, its exact distance was not measured for several years. Well before then, another major breakthrough occurred with the next event registered by BeppoSAX, GRB 970508. This event was localized within four hours of its discovery, allowing research teams to begin making observations much sooner than any previous burst. The spectrum of the object revealed a redshift of z=0.835, placing the burst {{at a distance of}} roughly 6 billionlight years from Earth. This was the first accurate determination of the distance to a GRB, and together with the discovery of the host galaxy of 970228 proved that GRBs occur in extremely distant galaxies. Within a few months, the controversy about the distance scale ended: GRBs were extragalactic events originating within faint galaxies at enormous distances. The following year, GRB 980425 was followed within a day by a bright supernova (SN 1998bw), coincident in location, indicating a clear connection between GRBs and the deaths of very massive stars. This burst provided the first strong clue <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systems that produce GRBs.|$|E
