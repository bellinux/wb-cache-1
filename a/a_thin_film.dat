40|$|Spin-wave {{resonance}} (SWR) is a newly emerged {{method for}} studying surface magnetic anisotropy and surface spin-wave modes (SSWMs) in (Ga,Mn) <b>As</b> <b>thin</b> <b>films.</b> The existence of SSWMs in (Ga,Mn) <b>As</b> <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> {{has recently been}} reported in the literature; SSWMs have been observed in the in-plane configuration (with variable azimuth angle ϕ_M between the in-plane magnetization of the film and the surface [100] crystal axis), in the azimuth angle range between two in-plane critical angles ϕ_c 1 and ϕ_c 2. We show here that cubic surface anisotropy is an essential factor determining the existence conditions of the above-mentioned SSWMs: conditions favorable for the occurrence of surface spin-wave modes in <b>a</b> (Ga,Mn) <b>As</b> <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> in the in-plane configuration are fulfilled for those azimuth orientations of the magnetization of the sample that lie around the hard axes of cubic magnetic anisotropy. This implies that a hard cubic anisotropy axis can be regarded in (Ga,Mn) <b>As</b> <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> as <b>an</b> easy axis for surface spin pinning...|$|R

Korean researchers have developed an amorphous tantalum-tungsten-copper alloy that is more flexible and two to three times stronger than commonly used steel alloys. There are two tantalum aluminides, TaAl3 and Ta3Al. These are stable, refractory, and reflective, and they have been proposed as coatings for use in infrared wave mirrors.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, {{a section}} funded by MI6 {{was created for}} propaganda, headed by Sir Campbell Stuart. It was {{allocated}} premises at Electra House and was dubbed Department EH. On 25 September 1939 the unit was mobilised to Woburn Abbey where it joined a subversion team from MI6, known as Section D, and by July these teams {{became a part of}} the newly created Special Operations Executive (SOE). These SOE elements went on to form the core of the Political Warfare Executive in 1941. Their task was to spread false rumours and conduct psychological warfare. Inspired by a demonstration of petroleum warfare, one false rumour stated that the British had a new bomb: dropped from an aircraft, it caused <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> of volatile liquid to spread over {{the surface of the water}} which it then ignited. Such rumours were credible and rapidly spread. American broadcaster William Shirer recorded large numbers of burns victims in Berlin; though it is not clear what he personally saw, it seems likely his reports were influenced by rumours. The interrogation of a Luftwaffe pilot revealed the existence of such weapons was common knowledge, and documents found after the war showed the German high command were deceived. The rumour seemed to take on a life of its own on both sides leading to persistent stories of a thwarted German invasion, in spite of official British denials. On 15 December 1940, The New York Times ran a story claiming that tens of thousands of German troops had been 'consumed by fire' in two failed invasion attempts.|$|E
