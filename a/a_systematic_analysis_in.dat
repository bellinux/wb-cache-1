In this study, we screened 477 ALS patients for mutations, including 116 familial ALS patients from 82 families and 361 sporadic ALS (sALS) cases.

40|$|We {{describe}} an approximate quantum mechanical picture of hadrons in Minkowski {{space in the}} context of a renormalization group procedure for effective particles (RGPEP) in a light-front Hamiltonian formulation of QCD. The picture suggests that harmonic oscillator potentials for constituent quarks in lightest mesons and baryons may result from the gluon condensation inside hadrons, rather than from an omnipresent gluon condensate in vacuum. The resulting boost-invariant constituent dynamics at the renormalization group momentum scales comparable with Lambda_QCD, is identified using gauge symmetry and a crude mean-field approximation for gluons. Besides constituent quark models, the resulting picture also resembles models based on AdS/QCD ideas. However, our hypothetical picture significantly differs from the models by the available option for <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>in</b> QCD, in which the new picture may be treated as a candidate for a first approximation. This option is outlined by embedding our presentation of the crude and simple hadron picture {{in the context of}} RGPEP and a brief outlook on hadron phenomenology.

40|$|Whereas in Escherichia coli DNA {{mismatch}} repair {{is directed to}} the newly synthesized strand due to its transient lack of adenine methylation, the molecular determinants of strand discrimination in eukaryotes are presently unknown. In mammalian cells, cytosine methylation within CpG sites may represent an analogous and mechanistically plausible means of targeting mismatch correction.

However, no effect on either the time course or the magnitude of mismatch repair events was evident; only strand discontinuities contributed to strand bias. By western analysis we demonstrated that the HeLa extract contained MED 1 protein, which interacts with MLH 1 and binds to CpG-methylated DNA; supplementation with purified MED 1 protein was without effect. In summary, human DNA mismatch repair operates independently of CpG methylation status, and we found no evidence supporting a role for CpG hemimethylation as a strand discrimination signal...|$|E

Xylan and glucomannan are the two major hemicelluloses in wood of angiosperms. However, {{little is known about}} the genes and gene products involved in the synthesis of these wood polysaccharides. Using Populus trichocarpa as a model angiosperm tree, we report here <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>in</b> various tissues of the absolute transcript copy numbers of cellulose synthase superfamily genes, the cellulose synthase (CesA) and the hemicellulose-related cellulose synthase-like (Csl) genes. Candidate Csl genes were characterized for biochemical functions in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S 2) cells. Of the 48 identified members, 37 were found expressed in various tissues. Seven CesA genes are xylem specific, suggesting gene networks for the synthesis of wood cellulose. Four Csl genes are xylem specific, three of which belong to the CslA subfamily. The more xylem-specific CslA subfamily is represented by three types of members: PtCslA 1, PtCslA 3, and PtCslA 5. They share high sequence homology, but their recombinant proteins produced by the S 2 cells exhibited distinct substrate specificity. PtCslA 5 had no catalytic activity with the substrates for xylan or glucomannan. PtCslA 1 and PtCslA 3 encoded mannan synthases, but PtCslA 1 further encoded a glucomannan synthase for the synthesis of (1 → 4) -β-d-glucomannan. The expression of PtCslA 1 is most highly xylem specific, suggesting a key role for it in the synthesis of wood glucomannan.

RF-amide-related peptides- 1 and - 3, neuropeptides AF and FF, Prolactin releasing peptides, Kisspeptins and RFa peptides are currently considered endogenous peptides for NPFF 1, NPFF 2, GPR 10, GPR 54 and GPR 103 receptors, respectively. However, several {{studies suggest that}} the selectivity of these peptides for their receptors is low and indicate that expression patterns for receptors and their corresponding ligands only partially overlap. In this study, we took advantage of the cloning of the five human RF-amide receptors to systematically examine their affinity for and their activation by all human RF-amide peptides. Binding experiments, performed on membranes from CHO cells expressing GPR 10, GPR 54 and GPR 103 receptors, confirmed their high affinity and remarkable selectivity for their cognate ligands. Conversely, NPFF 1 and NPFF 2 receptors displayed high affinity for all RF-amide peptides. Moreover, GTPγS and cAMP experiments showed that almost all RF-amide peptides efficiently activate NPFF 1 and NPFF 2 receptors. As NPFF is known to modulate morphine analgesia, we undertook <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>in</b> mice of the hyperalgesic and anti morphine-induced analgesic effects of a representative set of endogenous RF-amide peptides. All of them induced hyperalgesia and/or prevented morphine analgesia following intracerebroventricular administration.

Altogether, our results show that all endogenous RF-amide peptides display pain-modulating properties and point to NPFF receptors as essential players for these effects...|$|E

In the current study, we present a mutation analysis of the GBA gene in Spanish patients together with the clinical findings. We conducted <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>in</b> 53 unrelated GD patients. The GBA gene was initially scanned for nine previously described mutations by ASO hybridization or restriction analysis after PCR amplification. The remaining unidentified alleles were screened by nonisotopic PCR-SSCP analysis and sequenced. This approach allowed the identification of 101 of 106 GD alleles (95. 3 %) involving 24 different mutations, 11 of which are described for the first time: G 113 E (455 G®A), T 134 P (517 A®C), G 389 E (1283 G®A), P 391 L (1289 C®T), N 392 I (1292 A®T), Y 412 H (1351 T®G), W(- 4) X (108 G®A), Q 169 X (662 C®T), R 257 X (886 C®T), 500 insT, and IVS 5 + 1 G®T.

40|$|After the {{completion}} of the genomic sequences of man and mouse, the challenge will be to understand the function of all genes (about 30, 000) and proteins and to reconstruct the complex networks of biological processes underlying organism development and maintenance. Information on the expression profiles of these genes in the different tissues and cell types at various stages of development provides key insights into gene function(s) and allows to identify genes involved in common molecular mechanisms. As a pilot study for <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>in</b> the mouse, we have analysed the patterns of gene expression of the mouse orthologues to the 240 genes located on chromosome 21 in man, using a combination of different experimental and "in silico " techniques [1]. One of these techniques, socalled EST mining, has proven particularly effective for identifying tissue-specific genes and clusters of functionally related genes. We have screened all public mouse EST libraries; EST counts for chr. 21 orthologues were pooled in a non-redundant set of libraries and analysed by a method using the Pearson correlation coefficient. This approach is now being expanded to the analysis of all mouse and human genes based on the whole ENSEMBL reference set of genes. The profiles are being compared for identifying clusters of co-regulated genes present in both species. As an additional powerful technique, we have designed a cDNA chip representing approximately 20, 000 genes from the human ENSEMBL set (the mouse set is in progress) as a tool for analysing differential expression profiles for several well characterised human cell lines. These complementary approaches form the basis for building genome-scale gene expression maps as a first step towards identifying specific molecular phenotypes of cell lineages and tissues and give hints towards understanding gene function in complex biological networks.

30|$|Blood samples can be {{obtained}} relatively noninvasively from subjects at all ages; however, the measured metabolites may be from any organ and may lack sensitivity for the compartmentalized CF lung disease. Serum or plasma {{should not be used}} interchangeably given significant differences that have been described in <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>in</b> healthy, fasting subjects, where serum was found being less sensitive to incubation procedures and revealing a higher number of metabolites compared to the concomitantly obtained plasma [5]. Comparison of serum metabolomic profiles from 31 children with CF to age- and gender-matched children with other respiratory diseases showed differences in several metabolites and pathways linked to mitochondrial function including decreases in ketone bodies and medium chain carnitines. Further, several branched-chain amino acids were decreased in CF compared to non-CF suggestive of muscle wasting. Differences in bile acids and presumably bacterial-derived metabolites from the tryptophan pathway could be related to intestinal dysbiosis [6]. Laguna et al. evaluated plasma metabolomics in 25 subjects with CF comparing patient samples collected during exacerbation vs. clinical stability. Of the 398 identified metabolites, five metabolites were significantly lower during exacerbation compared to clinical stability. The affected pathways were related to nucleotide metabolism (hypoxanthine and N 4 -acetylcytidine), amino acid metabolism (N-acetylmethionine), carbohydrate (mannose), and steroid metabolism (cortisol). Principal component analysis using these five metabolites provided 79  % separation [7]. Given the known differences in lipid content of cells and fluids in CF, e.g., n- 6 and n- 3 fatty acids [8] and cholesterol [9], two studies used lipidomics for specific assessment of phospho- and lysolipids following organic extraction of plasma. Eighteen healthy children, 33 children with mild lung disease, and ten children with severe lung disease of CF were included [10]. Eleven peaks contributed to separation between CF and non-CF and four peaks were differentially displayed in mild vs. severe CF. A follow-up study evaluated potential correlations of plasma lipidomics with severity of lung disease and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection status. Plasma was obtained from 44 F 508 del homozygote patients at two time points, 3  years apart, to track disease progression. Twelve free fatty acids correlated with FEV 1 and six lipids showed associations with P. aeruginosa infection [11].|$|E

40|$|Das Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, die Strömungs- und Transportvorgänge in Plattenwärmeübertragern bei geringen Strömungsgeschwindigkeiten mit viskosen Modellflüssigkeiten zu untersuchen. Es werden in einer systematischen Analyse das Strömungs- und Transportverhalten sinusförmig gewellter Strukturen mit gekreuzter Plattenanordnungen bei geringen Reynoldszahlen zwischen 0, 1 < Reh < 10 sowohl experimentell als auch mit Hilfe der Strömungssimulation untersucht. Die Sichtbarmachung der Strömungsvorgänge zeigt, dass die Plattenprägung bei sehr kleinen Reh-Zahlen ihren Einfluss nur in engen Grenzen auf die Strömungsformen ausüben kann. Es liegt nur noch eine Strömungsform vor, die sich aus der Überlagerung der beiden Grundströmungsarten Längsströmung und Talströmung mit jeweils unterschiedlicher Gewichtung ihrer Anteile ergibt. Bei kleineren Reh-Zahlen und laminarer Strömung resultiert aus der Überlagerung von Längs- und Kanalströmung der neue Strömungstyp der Sinusströmung, bei der die Amplitude der Sinusströmung mit zunehmender Reh-Zahl immer kleiner wird, bis sich bei ausgebildeter laminarer Strömung die reine Längsströmung einstellt. Geometrieparameter der Plattenstrukturen, nämlich die dimensionslose Wellenlänge &# 955;/a, der Anströmwinkel &# 966; und der dimensionslose Abstand der Umkehrpunkte x/&# 955;*, kann der für diese Aufgabe technisch interessante Bereich identifiziert und vollständig abgedeckt werden. Mit einer Messmethode konvektiver Stoffübertragung auf der Basis von Chemisorption des Acidol-Blau-Farbstoffs werden die örtlichen übergegangenen Stoffmengen sichtbar gemacht und quantifiziert. Daraus lassen sich Rückschlüsse auf die wandnahen Grenzschichtströmungen ziehen. Mit Hilfe eines funktionellen Zusammenhanges zwischen Belegungsdichte und Remission lassen sich lokale Stoffübergangskoeffizienten bestimmen. Der hierzu benötigte Diffusionskoeffizient des Farbstoffs im verwendeten Versuchsmedium wird mit unterschiedlichen Untersuchungsmethoden und -verfahren bestimmt. Die zugeordneten Druckverlustmessungen beweisen, dass Strukturen mit höherem Stoffübergang in der Regel höhere Druckverluste aufweisen. Der Plattenprägung kommt eine dominante Rolle zu. Mit Hilfe hybrider Plattenanordnungen kann der Druckverlust reduziert werden, was dann allerdings zu einer deutlich niedrigeren Stoffübertragung führt. Umfangreiche Simulationsuntersuchungen werden mit dem kommerziellen Strömungs-simulationsprogramm ANSYS-CFX durchgeführt. Um eine Berechnung von lokalen Shx-Werten zu ermöglichen, wird das physikalische Modell der Grenzschichttheorie in ANSYS-CFX implementiert. Mit dem implementierten Stoffübergangsmodell können ebenfalls die zuvor experimentell bestimmten Kenngrößen sehr gut theoretisch berechnet werden. Dadurch wird in Zukunft eine erhebliche Reduktion des experimentellen Aufwands ermöglicht, der bislang zeit- und kostenintensiv ist. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} work {{is to examine the}} flow and the mass transfer processes of viscous fluids in a plate heat exchanger. A better understanding of these flow processes with low processing speeds, as they particularly arise in the food industry, are of special interest for this industry branch. The design of a good plate heat exchanger is quite dif-ficult and linked with great costs. So only few information is published in literature, because of the large complexity of the determination of the necessary design data. Therefore the flow and transportation properties of sinusoidal corrugated structures are examined in <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>in</b> the range of 0. 1 < Reh < 10. Both experiments and CFD-simulations are carried out in this analysis. The visualization of the flow processes shows that the stamping of the plate surface can only exert a very limited influence on the flow characteristics at very low Reynolds numbers. At higher flow rates and in the turbulent regime there are three flow types, as proven by many authors. These authors identify the so-called corkscrew, the so-called channel flow and the combination of these flows - the so-called mixing flow. In con-trast to these facts, a new flow type exists in the laminar flow regime, which results from the overlapping corkscrew flow and the channel flow. This new flow type is called sine flow in the present work. The sine flow's amplitude drops with a further reduction of the flow rate. At the end, the corkscrew flow only exists at extremely low flow rates. In the central range of the flow channels the corkscrew flow always prevails and the channel flow is dominant in the valleys of the corrugated plate surface. It can be seen, that a high portion of corkscrew flow has to be the aim for the processing of viscous fluids. The technical important range for this task could be identified and completely covered by the variation of the geometry parameters as the dimensionless wavelength &# 955;/a, the inclination angle &# 966; and the dimensionless distance of the reversal points x/&# 955;*. The fluid follows the respective flow channels, which are forced by plate stamping. The fluid is slightly accelerated and/or braked due to the surface corrugations and the cross-section reductions nearby the supporting points. Therefore regions develop with a high and/or a low mass transfer. A mixing of the individual streamlines doesn't take place through eddy structures. For the flow visualization and the determination of the local mass transfer in liquid flows a chemisorption method is used. The transferred mass is added as tracer to the test fluid. The locally transferred mass is visible as color density distribution and the color intensity directly corresponds to the locally transferred mass. Thus, one can draw con-clusions from the near-wall flow phenomena in the boundary layer. The color intensity of the light remission is measured with a scanner. With the help of a calibration equa-tion, the local Sherwood-numbers are calculated. The required diffusion coefficient of the tracer is determined by different methods. The measurements show that each flow form has a distinct influence on the mass transfer. This realization particularly {{plays an important role in}} the laminar flow regime, because of the lack of turbulence. The special characteristics of the two base flows realize a homogeneous mass transfer only with difficulties. The examination of the mass transfer's homogeneity confirms this state-ment. However, the assigned pressure drop measurements show, that structures with higher mass transfer usually exhibit higher pressure drop. The plate corrugation plays an im-portant role in this context. Improvements in the pressure loss can be obtained by using asymmetric plate arrangements, but which reduces the mass transfer behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the lithospheric density {{distribution}} on physical coupling of the subduction system {{in the area of}} the Central Andes (18 °– 35 °S) has been investigated. Amongst the composition of the subducting oceanic plate and properties of the subduction interface itself, there has also been evidence that increased coupling of the system may be linked to excess masses above the descending plate. High plate coupling is associated with an increased risk for megathrust earthquakes which occur at respective locations when the accumulated stresses are released and dispersed as seismic energy. Methodological considerations, forward–modelling as well as GPE- and stress calculations – that base on the utilisation and interpretation of the gravity field and its gradient tensor – have been applied in order to examine and analyse the density- and stress distribution in the target area. Particular attention has also been paid to the evaluation of gravity data from the GOCE satellite mission, which, for the first time, provides near–globally measured full–tensor gradiometric data. Methodological analysis concerning the resolving capacity of gravity and gradiometry reveal that measured gravity gradients of the GOCE mission are just sensitive enough to receive information at the order of the expected coastal batholiths' gravity anomaly in North Chile. Those are believed to significantly affect coupling of the subduction system through their relative excess mass. Synthetic 3 D density forward modelling of a standard subduction setting has been applied to further test the analysis. It confirms that density contrasts beyond resolvability for gravity data at the orbit height (~ 250 km) are just resolved in the gradient tensor and its invariants though. The spatial resolution of most recent potential field models that represent measurements from satellite missions is not better than spherical–harmonic degree and order (d/o) 300 (~ 67 km half–wavelength). This is still not sufficient for very detailed lithospheric or even crustal studies. It is mainly attributed to the signal–to–noise ratio conditions and to overlapping signals in the measurement systems at large distance to the source–masses. However, satellite-based data are virtually globally available and they are acquired and processed in homogeneous manner. They may therefore be consistently handled, analysed and interpreted. Terrestrial data, on the other hand, are strongly heterogeneously distributed, sometimes inadequately processed and meta-data is often not available. Their advantage is a good spatial resolution because of the short distance to the source–masses which allows the distinction of signals. When satellite–derived data are co–located with ground–based data, the respective advantages of both sets—homogeneous coverage and processing of satellite data and high resolution of terrestrial data—may be jointly utilized in one combined potential field model. Here, the combined regional gravity field model IMOSAGA 01 C has been employed which incorporates terrestrial gravity data of the Central Andes from more than 20 years and satellite–based data from the GOCO 03 S gravity field model. It has been used on a 6 x 6 –minute (~ 11 km) grid at 8 km altitude to optimize a pre–existing 3 D–density model of North Chile between 18 – 31. 5 °S and 66 – 73 °W. By applying geometry adjustments and density inversion, the standard deviation of the residual anomaly could be reduced by 62. 3 % to 6. 3 X 10 e- 5 m/s² for the model area. When also parts of the model area are considered that are not covered by terrestrial gravity data, this correspond to an overall error decrease by 68. 7 %. The adjusted geometry and density information of the density model served as an input to the computation of static stress anomalies on top of the subducting Nazca Plate. The interface–normal rotated component of the lithostatically–induced stress anomaly exhibits a clear segmentation of the forearc. It is characterized by a sequence of positive stress anomalies of up to 80 MPa along the coastal Jurassic batholith belt. It correlates well with the major seismicity of the active margin in North Chile and is attributed to mass excess in the continental crust and lithosphere above the subduction interface. A joint analysis with coupling coefficients from GPS–modelling revealed that positive stress anomalies in the order of 0 – 100 MPa act as an approximate threshold for the minimum plate coupling (in per cent) within the scope of the seismogenic zone between 18. 75 °S and 21. 75 °S. Thus, there must exist patches along the margin where the plate coupling is generally higher than in areas with less relative load (except co-seismic state). Furthermore, <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>in</b> the area of the April 2014 megathrust earthquake offshore Pisagua/Iquique revealed that coupling and stress anomalies {{in the area of the}} fracture plane form virtual loops in their common parameter–space. This could be understood as a strong indicator for the validity of the stress–induced coupling hypothesis. In the future, this finding could help to better understand the seismo–periodic state of a subduction system. This work comes to the conclusion that potential field data from the GOCE mission, despite its high sensitivity, must be understood to reside at the very edge of an appropriate resolution for detailed lithospheric studies. The IMOSAGA 01 C combined gravity field model however, which collocates the satellite– and surface–based gravity data, clearly outperforms the existing combined models in this regard. Hereby the quality of density models can be improved, which in turn leads to better constrained derivatives such as dynamic models or stress anomalies. From the latter it could finally be concluded that the hypothesis for the North Chile case is acceptable, that relative mass excess above the subducting Nazca Plate co–generates asperities with increased potential for megathrust earthquakes. Mit der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde der Einfluss der Dichteverteilung kontinentaler Lithosphäre auf die physikalische Kopplung des Subduktionssystems im Bereich der Zentralanden (18 °– 35 °S) untersucht. Neben der Beschaffenheit der subduzierenden ozeanischen Platte und den Eigenschaften der Grenzfläche der Subduktion selbst, gibt es Hinweise darauf, dass ein relativer Massenüberschuss oberhalb der abtauchenden Platte in Zusammenhang mit erhöhter Kopplung des Systems steht. Gleichzeitig erhöht sich die Gefahr durch Starkbeben, die an entsprechenden Lokationen auftreten, wenn die aufgebauten Spannungen an den Blockaden gelöst werden und in Form seismischer Energie freigesetzt werden. Methodische Überlegungen, Forwärtsmodellierungen, sowie GPE- und Stressberechnungen, die auf der Interpretation des Schwerefeldes und seines Gradiententensors beruhen, wurden angewendet, um die Dichte- und Stressverteilung im Untersuchungsgebiet näher zu bestimmen und zu analysieren. Ein besonderes Augenmerk lag auch auf der Evaluierung der Schweredaten der Satellitenmission GOCE, welche erstmals gemessene gradiometrische Daten des gesamten Schwere–Tensors nahezu global zur Verfügung stellte. Methodische Analysen zum Auflösungsvermögen der Schwere– und Gradiometrie–Daten ergaben, dass die gemessenen Gradienten der GOCE Mission hinreichend sensitiv sind, um Informationen in der Größenordnung der erwarteten Schwereanomalie der Küstenbatholithe in Nordchile zu registrieren. Es wird angenommen, dass diese durch ihren Massenüberschuss die Kopplung des Subduktionssystems signifikant beeinflussen. Die synthetische 3 D-Dichtemodellierung eines standardisierten Subduktions-Settings wurde verwendet, um diese Überlegung zu überprüfen. Sie bestätigt das Ergebnis, dass Dichtekontraste, die sich für Schweredaten in Orbithöhe (~ 250 km) jenseits der Auflösbarkeit befinden, durch den Schweregradienten-Tensor und seine Invarianten hingegen gerade noch aufgelöst werden können. Die räumliche Auflösung aktueller Potenzialfeld–Modelle, welche Messungen von Satellitenmissionen wiedergeben, ist nicht besser als Grad/Ordnung 300 (~ 67 km Halbwellenlänge). Das ist für sehr detaillierte Studien der Lithosphäre oder Kruste noch unzureichend. Ursachen hierfür sind in erster Linie die Kondition des Signal–Rausch–Verhältnisses und sich überlagernde Signale im Messsystem bei großer Distanz zu den verursachenden Massen. Dafür sind Satelliten–basierte Daten quasi–global verfügbar und homogen aufgenommen. Sie können konsistent prozessiert, analysiert und interpretiert werden. Terrestrische Daten hingegen sind zumeist extrem heterogen verteilt, sehr unterschiedlich prozessiert und Metadaten stehen oft nicht zur Verfügung. Der Vorteil bei ihrer Verwendung liegt darin, dass sie aufgrund des geringen Abstandes zu den Quellen ein hohes räumliches Auflösungsvermögen haben und eine entsprechend klare Signaltrennung möglich ist. Die jeweiligen Vorteile beider Datenarten — homogene Aufnahme, Abdeckung und Prozessierung der Satellitendaten sowie hohe Auflösung der terrestrischen Daten — können in einer kombinerten Bearbeitung vereinigt werden, wenn beide Datensätze über Kollokation zusammengeführt werden. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde das kombinerte regionale Schwerefeldmodell IMOSAGA 01 C verwendet, welches terretrische Schweredaten aus mehr als 20 Jahren Bodenmessungen in den Zentralanden, sowie Satelliten-basierte Daten aus dem GOCO 03 S Schwerefeldmodell zusammenführt. Hier wurde ein 6 x 6 –Minuten (~ 11 km) Grid in 8 km Höhe verwendet, um ein vorhandenes 3 D Dichtemodell von Nordchile im Bereich 18 – 31. 5 °S und 66 – 73 °W zu optimieren. Durch Anpassungen der Modellgeometrie und durch Dichte–Inversion konnte die Standardabweichung der Residualanomalie im Bereich der Modellierung um 62, 3 % auf 6. 3 x 10 e- 5 m/s² gesenkt werden. Unter zusätzlicher Berücksichtigung der Modellgebiete, die nicht mit terrestrischen Schweremessungen abgedeckt sind, entspricht dies einer Verbesserung um 68, 7 %. Die angepassten Geometrie– und Dichteinformationen des Dichtemodells dienten als Eingangsgrößen zur Berechnung statischer Stressanomalien auf der subduzierten Nazca–Platte. Die normal zur Subduktion rotierte Komponente der lithostatisch induzierten Stressanomalie weist eine deutliche Segmentierung des Forearcs auf. Diese zeichnet sich durch ein Band mit positiven Stressanomalien von bis zu 80 MPa im Bereich der Jurassischen Küstenbatholithe aus. Es korreliert mit der vorherrschenden Seismizität des aktiven Kontinentalrandes in Nordchile und ist auf Massenüberschüsse innerhalb der kontinentalen Kruste und Lithosphäre oberhalb der Subduktions-Grenzfläche zurückzuführen. Im Gebiet der seismogenen Zone zwischen 18. 75 °S und 21. 75 °S zeigte eine gemeinsame Analyse mit Kopplungs-Koeffizienten aus GPS–Modellen, dass positive Stressanomalien im Bereich 0 – 100 MPa jeweils als näherungsweise Schwellenwerte für die minimale Kopplung (in Prozent) eingesetzt werden können. Demnach muss es Regionen geben, in denen die Kopplung der Platten, bis auf den co-seismischen Zustand, ständig höher ist als in Regionen mit geringerer relativer Auflast. Darüber hinaus zeigte eine systematische Analyse im Bereich des Starkbebens von Pisagua/Iquique vom April 2014, dass Plattenkopplung und Stressanomalien innerhalb ihres gemeinsamen Parameterraumes für den Bereich der Bruchfläche über virtuelle Schleifen verknüpft sind. Dies kann als Kennzeichen für die Gültigkeit der These zur Stress–induzierten Kopplung gewertet werden. Diese Erkenntnis könnte zukünftig dabei helfen, den seismozyklischen Zustand eines Subduktionssystems besser zu verstehen. Die vorliegende Arbeit kommt zu dem Schluss, dass sich die Potenzialfeld–Daten der GOCE Mission trotz der hohen Sensitivität im Grenzbereich der notwendigen Auflösung für detaillierte Lithosphärenstudien liegen. Das kombinierte Schwerefeldmodell IMOSAGA 01 C hingegen, welches die Satelliten– und Boden–gestützten Schweredaten zusammenführt, übertrifft existierende kombinierte Modelle in dieser Hinsicht deutlich. Hierdurch lässt sich die Qualität der Dichtemodelle erhöhen, was zu einer besser validierten Zusatzinterpretation führt, wie zum Beispiel dynamische Modelle oder Stressanomalien zeigen. Aus letzteren konnte abgeleitet werden, dass die Hypothese, derzufolge relative Massenüberschüsse oberhalb der subduzierenden Nazca–Platte Asperities mit erhöhtem Gefährdungspotenzial für Starkbeben mitverursachen, für das Untersuchungsgebiet in Nordchile gültig ist...|$|E

40|$|With the {{development}} of new applications using semiconductor ring lasers (SRLs) subject to optical feedback, the stability properties of their outputs becomes a crucial issue. We propose <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> bifurcation <b>analysis</b> <b>in</b> order to properly identify the best parameter ranges for either steady or self-pulsating periodic regimes.

We demonstrate that the self-pulsating regime results from a particular Hopf bifurcation mechanism referred to as bifurcation bridges. These bridges connect two distinct external cavity modes and are fully stable, a scenario that was not possible for diode lasers under the same conditions.

Depending on the value of the equation of state parameter, different pre-inflationary epochs lead instead to an enhancement of power at low ℓ, and so seem disfavoured by recent observational hints for a lack of CMB power at ℓ≲  40.
