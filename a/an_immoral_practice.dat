500|$|Contraception {{was legal}} in the United States {{throughout}} most of the 19th century, but in the 1870s a social purity movement grew in strength, aimed at outlawing vice in general, and prostitution and obscenity in particular.Engelman, pp. 13–14. Composed primarily of Protestant moral reformers and middle-class women, the Victorian-era campaign also attacked contraception, which was viewed as <b>an</b> <b>immoral</b> <b>practice</b> that promoted prostitution and venereal disease. Anthony Comstock, a postal inspector and leader in the purity movement, successfully lobbied for the passage of the 1873 Comstock Act, a federal law prohibiting mailing of [...] "any article or thing designed or intended for the prevention of conception or procuring of abortion" [...] as well as any form of contraceptive information. Many states also passed similar state laws (collectively known as the Comstock laws), sometimes extending the federal law by outlawing the use of contraceptives, as well as their distribution. Comstock was {{proud of the fact that}} he was personally responsible for thousands of arrests and the destruction of hundreds of tons of books and pamphlets.|$|E

Polygamy (marriage to multiple partners) was illegal in many U.S. states, and was widely perceived as <b>an</b> <b>immoral</b> and misguided <b>practice.</b> The practice of polygamy was denied by the Church of Christ and Smith.

Business ethics represents <b>a</b> reaction against <b>immoral</b> <b>practices</b> with negative effects in society, but also an awareness of the observance necessity of moral rules in the field of economics. Social responsible marketing imposes that market approach attends firm interests and also those approached. Social responsibility is a tool of assurance for the firm success on long term. More and more companies are concerned in ethical conscience growing up of the managers and workers. The firms have to analyze if their marketing activity is actually ethical and social responsible. It is advisable that organizations conceive corporate policies of marketing ethics that include detailed directions that have to be observed by the staff of the company.

50|$|One of {{the chief}} impediments to the {{development}} of Welsh theatre (in both English and Welsh), throughout much of history, was the lack of major urban centres.

50|$|Another {{doctrine}} that the Seventh-Day Evangelist Church teaches is that marriage in God's eyes is not practiced {{by a large}} number of people in the world. The church teaches that despite going to church for a wedding ceremony and obtaining a legal documentation and approval without God's approval and recognition it is nothing more than <b>an</b> <b>immoral</b> <b>practice</b> and an organized form of adultery. Among the 25 fundamental teachings there are other unique doctrines like the one pertaining to marriage. All in all The most important doctrine of The Seventh-Day Evangelist Church is the doctrine of salvation. Evangelist Church may have beliefs in common with the Seventh-Day Adventist church, but she never originated from the Adventist Church although the founder of the church attended the Adventist Church in the past.|$|E

During one such speech was allegedly attacked with a razor by members of the 43 Group. However his olive skin also led to rumours that he was of a Romani descent. Other rumours that his wife Olive had been a communist were true as she had served as a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain's Hendon branch. As a sideline Burgess imported pornographic magazines from the United States, a source of mirth amongst some of his fellow members, although ultimately this was ended when one of his political colleagues reported Burgess to the police for what he considered <b>an</b> <b>immoral</b> <b>practice.</b>|$|E

The question of how to address <b>immoral</b> <b>practices</b> in society is considered in this paper from the view point of integrating the ‘objectives of Islamic law’/values in school curriculum.

In this way, moral values can be strategically built through integrating the practical image of Islam and maintain social justice by observing ‘Maqasid Al-shariah’ that aim at developing mankind as a whole; physically, emotionally, intellectually, religiously and morally...|$|R
