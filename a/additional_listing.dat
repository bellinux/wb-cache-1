25|$|With {{a better}} {{knowledge}} of the beetles distribution and habitat a recovery plan was formed. The first plan of action was to identify the areas targeted for recovery. It was decided that if four of the karst invertebrates (Neoleptoneta myopica, Tartarocreagris texana, Tevamaurops reddelli, and Batrisodes texanus) inhabited a cave {{it needed to be}} deemed a long term protection plan. If a habitat is to be recovered areas that contain high diversity and contain other rare fauna should be chosen. The <b>additional</b> <b>listing</b> of species should be taken into thought when choosing recovery areas. Areas of land selected for recovery should be spread out as far as possible to protect from a major catastrophic event does not take out the entire population. Other factors to consider when selecting recovery sites include areas that ensure long term protection, stable environment, and past and present land use. The second part of the recovery plan was to decide the size of area needed to save them. Areas of large continuous karst landscape must be implicated to ensure the survival of the invertebrates. Groundwater movements, topography, and drainage pattern were taken into place when selecting areas for recovery. All of these things must be perfect for a successful recovery. Also the type of use for surrounding land must be considered. If the area is to close to development, many factors can threaten its recovery including the threats listed above. The final step of the plan included land acquisition, conservation easements, and cooperative agreements with landowners. This final is very important. Without the land needed to save the invertebrates the recovery can not take place and the endangered species will become extinct.|$|E

50|$|There are, however, also {{disadvantages}} {{in deciding}} to cross-list: increased pressure on executives due to closer public scrutiny; increased reporting and disclosure requirements; additional scrutiny by analysts in advanced market economies, and <b>additional</b> <b>listing</b> fees.

No date is provided, however, the Dominion Studio is listed as operating from 1893 - 1894. The reverse of the card displays the Dominion Photo Studio stamp in gold lettering (image also attached). The gentleman in this cabinet card is possibly a relative of the Sloman - Bell family, who settled in the London and St. Catharines areas of Ontario. This cabinet card was among the family memorabilia {{in the possession of}} Iris Sloman Bell, of St. Catharines. Relatives of the Sloman - Bell family include former African American slaves who came to Canada. The Dominion Portait Co. is listed as operating from 1893 - 1894 in Toronto. There is an <b>additional</b> <b>listing</b> for the Dominion Portrait Co. (Gourlay and Clark props.) for 1894. Source: Phillips, Glen C. The Ontario photographers list (1851 - 1900). Sarnia: Iron Gate Publishing Co., 1990. "Cabinet card photographs were first introduced in 1866. They were initially employed for landscapes rather than portraitures. Cabinet cards replaced Carte de visite photographs as the popular mode of photography. Cabinet cards became the standard for photographic portraits in 1870. Cabinet cards experienced their peak in popularity in the 1880 's. Cabinet cards were still being produced in the United States until the early 1900 's and continued to be produced in Europe even longer.

40|$|All {{over the}} world infective {{endocarditis}} is a serious disease, which has already been known for more than 100 years and entails an infection of cardiovascular structures typically caused by bacteria. Despite recent medical advances the course of disease that may result in serious complications even nowadays leads {{in some cases to}} death. In order to improve diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic treatment strategies, groups of scientists of different nations concentrate on research of infective endocarditis. The disease’s wide spectrum of causative microorganisms as well as their sometimes difficult identification and changing risk groups pose further difficulties. The aim of this study was the analysis of the worldwide research of infective endocarditis which was published during 1900 and 2008, on the basis of scientometric procedures. The search term “infect* endocardit*” produced the total number of 5, 910 hits in the database “ISI-Web of Science”. These relevant publications formed the foundation for this enquiry. They were examined further regarding different aspects like date, type, and country of publication, language, scientific journals, institutions, subject areas as well as authorship. In addition, citation analyses were made by using the “Science Citation Index“ of the “Web of Science“. Numerous graphical images as well as cartograms were created for better illustration. During the first 70 years, only sporadic publications about infective endocarditis were registered. Thus, only starting in 1970, the amount of research increased in the course of time. Several years that show a significant ascent of hits can be allocated to specific incidents. In this context, a change of paradigm in 2007 regarding the prophylactic procedures leads to a rise of the research attention. In contrast, the increased number of publications in the early 90 s was caused by the <b>additional</b> <b>listing</b> of abstracts in the database of the “ISI-Web of Science” which lead to a higher hit rate. Moreover the cumulative optimizing of data acquisition of the respective online databases can be felt. All in all, the growing number suggests expanding activities of research and underlines the timeliness of infective endocarditis. 84. 65 % of the identified publications were written in the English language. The majority of publications in the field of endocarditis research are contributed by the United States as well as Western European countries. The same holds true for the publishing institutions. They collaborate actively, which is a crucial factor. These cooperational relations are established both between the different countries and among the individual authors. Those interactions are to be considered in connection with the establishing of national and international organizations dealing with infective endocarditis (e. g. ICE, ISCVID, AHA, ZEN). The citation analyses show that the American publications receive the biggest scientific resonance, as their total sum (33, 965) and rate (18. 8) indicate. They are followed by some European countries. The scientific journals Clinical Infectious Diseases and Circulation are most relevant with high numbers of publications (163) and numerous citations (4452 and 3625) in the field of infective endocarditis. Other important journals are the The New England Journal of Medicine, which is expressed by its high rate of citation (89. 5), and the European Heart Journal, which shows the greatest number of topic-oriented publications. Among the most productive authors several distinguished scientists stand out who have achieved similar values concerning the h-indices and their number of publications and citations. The author with the biggest quantity of publications is Didier Raoult, a French expert on infectious diseases and professor of microbiology. Regarding the total sum of citations, the American doctor and researcher G. Ralph Corey has distinguished himself, while the American professor Arnold S. Bayer shows the highest h-index of 28. Alongside those most productive authors the scientific works of D. T. Durack receive a high resonance as is indicated by the extraordinary citation rate of 72. 3. This is presumably connected to a diagnostic scheme that {{can be traced back to}} him, namely the Duke criteria...|$|E
