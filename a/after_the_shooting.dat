5|$|Another {{issue is}} why France2, the Associated Press and Reuters did not film the scene {{directly}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> including the {{shooting death of}} the ambulance driver who arrived to pick up Jamal and Muhammad.

5|$|Euell {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} and died about an hour <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> He was never able to formally identify Shay as the shooter. When Shay was arrested in his hotel room that night, police officers said that he appeared to be intoxicated. He refused to make any statements. He was held without bail and charged with second-degree murder. A conviction carried the possibility of life imprisonment. A few days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> American Association owners began to collect funds to assist in Shay's criminal defense. As the case was about to go to trial, one of the attorneys became ill, so the proceedings were delayed for several weeks. The trial was reset for November 12, 1917.|$|E

40|$|Summary &mdash; A {{pine shoot beetle}} {{attack was}} {{simulated}} by cutting all current <b>shoots</b> in <b>the</b> upper crown of 2 20 -yr-old Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L) while gas exchange was followed continuously before and <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> removal. Net photosynthetic rate and mesophyll conductance of <b>the</b> 2 -yr-old <b>shoots</b> decreased by = 50 % immediately after pruning but recovered within 10 d <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> removal. <b>The</b> quantum yield was also much lower after cutting. Water status and transpiration rate were not systematically affected by the treatment. Possible explanations of the photosynthetic decrease could be an accumulation of assimilation prod-ucts decreasing the mesophyll conductance of carbon dioxide to the chloroplasts or changes of the carbon allocation pattern...|$|R

5|$|If {{the police}} {{identified}} Bostic {{even before the}} shooting occurred, he would have faced a two-year prison sentence for violating the terms of his parole, since he was out past his curfew. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> police discovered the BMW had been stolen from the Five Towns Mitsubishi car dealership in Inwood, Long Island, where Bostic worked as a salesman. A motor vehicle theft or gun possession conviction would have been Bostic's third felony, likely resulting in a lengthy prison sentence.|$|E

5|$|Three {{mainstream}} narratives emerged <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> The early {{view that}} Israeli gunfire {{had killed the}} boy developed into the position that, because of the trajectory of the shots, Palestinian gunfire {{was more likely to}} have been responsible. This view was expressed in 2005 by Denis Jeambar, editor-in-chief of L'Express, and , a former France2 correspondent, who viewed the raw footage. A third perspective, held by Arlette Chabot, France 2's news editor, is that no one can know who fired the shots.|$|E
