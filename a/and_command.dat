5|$|By {{the close}} of the first day, the 7th Army was still largely mobilising and concentrating, and fifth column actions meant that nearly all the {{fighting}} was conducted by border troops. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was deployed along the southern bank of the Drava, with the 128th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Ptuj, the 45th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Maribor and the 112th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion were at Slovenj Gradec and marching east towards Dravograd. German and Italian air attacks interfered with the deployment of troops <b>and</b> <b>command</b> was hampered by reliance on civilian telegraph and telephone services.|$|E
5|$|Cariappa's {{alliance}} with the Indian Army was spread {{over a period of}} around three decades, during which he had broad experience of staff <b>and</b> <b>command</b> work. After his retirement in 1953, he served as the Indian high commissioner to Australia and New Zealand until 1956. With a view toward ex-servicemen's welfare, Cariappa founded the Indian Ex-Servicemen's League (IESL) in 1964.

5|$|During its {{development}} the ZNG experienced {{a number of}} problems, including shortages of weapons and ammunition, lack of uniforms, inadequate training and an overall deficiency in trained officers, and poor staff work <b>and</b> <b>command</b> structures (preventing the effective coordination of multiple units).

After the Battle of the Barracks, the ZNG expanded significantly with arms captured from the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija). By the end of October 60 new brigades and independent battalions were established, and on 3 November the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska).|$|E

5|$|For the French, {{despite their}} success earlier at Frauenfeld, {{the action was}} {{considerably}} less successful. In the clash, Ney was sufficiently wounded that he took immediate leave, and remained out of action <b>and</b> <b>command</b> until 22 July. The conduct of the battle also demonstrated {{the weakness of the}} French command system in which personal animosity and competition between high-ranking officers, in this case, Soult and Tharreau, undermined French military objectives. Tharreau eventually charged Soult with insubordination; Soult had outright refused to go to Ney's assistance, despite specific, and direct, orders to move his division to Ney's flanks.|$|E

5|$|Forster was, however, criticised in {{the early}} part of his time at Celtic for lacking {{confidence}} <b>and</b> <b>command,</b> and uncertain when he had the ball at his feet.
