2500|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, Thomas began writing and {{performing}} his own songs. He regarded Louis Armstrong, Fats Waller and Gatemouth Moore as musical influences. He made his professional singing debut at the Elks Club on Beale Street, {{filling in for}} another singer at the last minute, and during the 1940s became a regular performer in Memphis nightclubs, such as Currie`s Club Tropicana. As an established performer in Memphis, aged 33 in 1950, Thomas recorded his first 78 rpm single, for Jesse Erickson's small Star Talent label in Dallas, Texas. Thomas said, [...] "I {{just wanted to make}} a record. I never thought of getting rich. I just wanted to be known, be a recording artist.... the record sold five copies <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> four of them." [...] The record, [...] "I'll Be a Good Boy" [...] backed with [...] "I'm So Worried", gained a Billboard review, which stated that [...] "Thomas shows first class style on a slow blues". [...] He also recorded for the Bullet label in Nashville, Tennessee, when he recorded with Bobby Plater's Orchestra and was credited as [...] "Mr. Swing"; the recordings were not recognised by researchers as being by Thomas until 1996. [...] In 1951 he made his first recordings at Sam Phillips's Sun Studio, for the Chess label, but they were not commercially successful.|$|E
2500|$|Hoppus {{describes}} himself as [...] "pretty straight" [...] until junior high, when he began skateboarding and listening to punk rock. He lived in Fairfax, Virginia (a suburb of Washington, D.C.) during his early high school years and attended Annandale High School during his second year, at which time he received his first bass guitar and attended his first concert: They Might Be Giants at the [...] shortly before his sixteenth birthday, March 4, 1988. [...] "I didn't know where I should stand or what I should do, so my friends <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> some menthol cigarettes and smoked {{for the first time}} and tried to look as cool as we could. We probably looked like idiots," [...] Hoppus remembered. Hoppus received his first bass (a Mako) as a gift from his father, purchased at a local music shop in Annandale. He earned money for a set of amplifiers by helping him paint his house. Hoppus never took bass lessons, instead he taught himself by playing to bands such as the Descendents, The Cure, and Bad Religion. Hoppus has remarked that [...] "Silly Girl" [...] by the Descendents was the [...] "song that made me fall in love with punk rock music [...] that song changed my life forever." [...] Likewise, Hoppus borrowed a cassette version of The Cure's Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me from friend Wendy Franklin the summer following junior high school and was taken with [...] "Just Like Heaven".|$|E

6000|$|... 'And {{there is}} nothing;--nothing at all! I've bought some {{property}} and {{have paid for}} it; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>bought</b> some, <b>and</b> have not yet paid for it. There's no fraud in that.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{saw that}} it was of no use to contend with a big fellow like that, as strong as two common men, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> the bean.|$|E
6000|$|... "The two only cost a rouble," [...] Luka said calmly; [...] "they may be {{very useful}} to us; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> more tea and tobacco than we said." ...|$|E

6000|$|I wore a fur great-coat at that time, {{and before}} we were well clear of the wharf, he {{questioned}} me concerning it, and its price, <b>and</b> where <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> it, <b>and</b> when, and what fur it was, and what it weighed, and what it cost.

6000|$|Bob {{shook his}} head. She arose from her restful position, her eye {{catching}} his with a shamefaced expression of having given way at last.

60|$|This was a {{sensible}} proposition, <b>and,</b> as treasurer, <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> the stock, the queen having signified {{her willingness to}} the treaty by a dignified nod and a courtesy. She was very much given to style, which encouraged us a good deal.|$|R

6000|$|... "That is right," [...] Fergus said. [...] "My father fell at Culloden, you know. As to {{all your}} other questions, they are {{answered}} easily enough.
