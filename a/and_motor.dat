5|$|Focal {{seizures}} {{are often}} preceded by certain experiences, known as auras. They include sensory (visual, hearing, or smell), psychic, autonomic, <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> phenomena. Jerking activity may start {{in a specific}} muscle group and spread to surrounding muscle groups in which case it {{is known as a}} Jacksonian march. Automatisms may occur, which are non-consciously-generated activities and mostly simple repetitive movements like smacking of the lips or more complex activities such as attempts to pick up something.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the agency, the only means of {{transportation}} were bullock-carts known as jhatkas along with palanquins. The roads connecting Madras to Calcutta in the north and the kingdom of Travancore in the south served as lines of communication during wars. From the early 20th century onwards, bullock-carts and horses were gradually replaced by bicycles <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> vehicles, while motor buses were the main means of private road transportation. Presidency Transport and the City Motor Service were pioneers, operating buses manufactured by Simpson and Co. as early as 1910. The first organised bus system in Madras city was operated by Madras Tramways Corporation between 1925 and 1928. The 1939 Motor Vehicles Act imposed restrictions on public-owned bus <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> services. Most of the early bus services were operated by private agencies.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{pathogenic}} mutations {{have been}} identified in the prion-like domains of heterogeneous nuclear riboproteins hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1 in familial cases of muscle, brain, bone <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> neuron degeneration. The wild-type form of all of these proteins show a tendency to self-assemble into amyloid fibrils, while the pathogenic mutations exacerbate this behaviour and lead to excess accumulation.|$|E
5|$|Tactile sensory {{perception}} in divers may be impaired {{by the environmental}} protection suit and low temperatures. The combination of instability, equipment, neutral buoyancy and resistance to movement by the inertial and viscous effects of the water encumbers the diver. Cold causes losses in sensory <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> function and distracts from and disrupts cognitive activity. The ability to exert large and precise force is reduced.|$|E

5|$|The UERL had {{financial}} problems. Ticket {{prices were}} low and passenger numbers were significantly below the pre-opening estimates.

The spread of street-level electric trams <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, also took a large number of passengers away from the trains.|$|E

40|$|The design, synthesis, {{and dynamic}} {{behavior}} {{of a series of}} novel tetrapodal molecular switches <b>and</b> <b>motors</b> containing common functional groups for attachment to various inorganic and organic surfaces are presented. Using a Diels-Alder reaction, an anthracene unit with four functionalized alkyl substituents ("legs") was coupled to maleimide-functionalized molecular switches or motors under ambient conditions. Terminal functional groups at the "legs" include thioacetates and azides, making these switches <b>and</b> <b>motors</b> ideal candidates for attachment to metallic or alkyne-functionalized surfaces. UV/vis absorption spectroscopy shows that the molecular switches <b>and</b> <b>motors</b> retain their ability to undergo reversible photoinduced and/or thermally induced structural changes after attachment to the tetrapodal anthracene...|$|R

The destroyers were tasked with landing a team of South African coast watchers on the north tip of Rab, the MTBs with patrolling the Kvarner Gulf between Rab and Krk islands, {{while the rest of the}} force loitered southwest, near Premuda.
