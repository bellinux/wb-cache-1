500|$|In an {{effective}} change of pace, Harrison {{picked up his}} acoustic guitar, now alone on the stage save for Pete Ham on a second acoustic, and Don Nix's gospel choir, off to stage-left. The ensuing [...] "Here Comes the Sun" [...] – the first live performance of the song, as for Harrison's other Beatle compositions played that day – was also warmly received. At this point, Harrison switched back to his white Fender Stratocaster electric guitar and, as recounted to Anthony DeCurtis in 1987, {{he looked down at}} the setlist taped to the body of the guitar and saw the word [...] "Bob" [...] followed by a question mark. [...] "And I looked around," [...] Harrison recalled of Bob Dylan's entrance, [...] "and he was so nervous – he had his guitar on and his shades – he was sort of coming on, coming ... It was only at that moment that I knew for sure he was going to do it." [...] Among the audience, Schaffner wrote, there was [...] "total astonishment" [...] <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> arrival.|$|E
500|$|On 2 June the French liner Jamaique {{reported}} a small boat, flying the British flag and steaming southwards, near the Bissagos Islands [...] south of Dakar. Although {{this was at}} first assumed to be Girl Pat, the next reported [...] sighting, on 9 June, was more than [...] to the west, {{on the other side}} of the Atlantic. Captain Jones of the Lorraine Cross, an American ship, cabled Lloyds' agents in Georgetown, British Guiana (now Guyana) with an account of a small ship flying a distress signal off the South American coast, [...] north-east of Cayenne. There were apparently four men on board. The boat's name and markings had been painted out, but she claimed to be the [...] "Margaret Harold" [...] bound for Trinidad from London. Jones thought the crew's behaviour suspicious, and when he asked to see the ship's papers, the ship lowered the distress signal and sped away. Jones said the vessel was [...] "undoubtedly a British fisherman", and thought it was Girl Pat. In Grimsby, a Marstrand spokesman expressed little surprise <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> location, and confirmed that the ship had sufficient speed to have crossed the ocean in the time since her last confirmed sighting. A check with Lloyd's indicated that there was no registered ship named Margaret Harold.|$|E

In an ironic twist, Chūyō was carrying American prisoners of war from , the same boat that had helped locate and rescue Sailfish—then Squalus—over four years before. Twenty of the 21 US crew members from Sculpin were killed. None, however, were of the original rescue crew. 1,250 Japanese were also killed.|$|E
