40|$|Abstract: In {{the field}} of modern logistics, <b>assembled</b> steel <b>racks</b> {{are one of the}} most widely used {{structure}} forms. Hold-welding beams, as the main load-bearing component, were researched in this paper. Firstly, mathematical relationship between semi-rigid joint stiffness K and bearing capacity of hold-welding beams P were derived. Then, hold-welding beams which span were 2300 mm, 3000 mm, 3300 mm and 3600 mm were analyzed. When K varies from 0 to 30 EI/L, the bearing capacity P was concluded. Finally, the most suitable joint stiffness was concluded respectively in four types of span...|$|R
50|$|Rack railway {{switches}} are {{as varied}} as rack railway technologies. Where use of the rack is optional, as on the Zentralbahn in Switzerland or the West Coast Wilderness Railway in Tasmania, {{it is common to}} place turnouts only in relatively flat areas where the rack is not needed. On systems where only the pinion is driven and the conventional rail wheels are idlers, such as the Dolderbahn in Zürich, Štrbské Pleso in Slovakia and the Schynige Platte rack railway, the rack must be continuous through the switch. The Dolderbahn switch works by bending all three rails, an operation that is performed every trip as the two trains pass in the middle. The Štrbské Pleso and Schynige Platte Strub rack system instead relies on a complex set of moving points which <b>assemble</b> the <b>rack</b> in the traversed direction and simultaneously clear the crossed direction conventional rails. In some rack systems, such as the Morgan system, where locomotives always have multiple driving pinions, it is possible to simplify turnouts by interrupting the rack rail, so long as the interruption is shorter than the spacing between the drive pinions on the locomotives.|$|R

40|$|International audienceDuring a {{disposal}} of palletised packed aerial maroons, an incident occurred {{and the following}} behavioural patterns were observed: 50 mm aerial maroons exploded individually, 75 mm aerial maroons exploded en mass, mixed pallets containing both 50 mm and 75 mm maroons also exploded en mass. Therefore, mass explosion tests have been performed {{in order to proceed}} to perform an indepth analysis of the global behaviour of the maroons during disposal. A series of five 50 mm or 75 mm maroons have been <b>assembled</b> in a <b>rack,</b> simulating mono-dimensional actual assembly in a package. In the test procedure, they were initiated at one end, and measurements were done by means of optic fibres, overpressure lenses, heat flux gauges, and noise transducers. The "explosion velocity" parameter seems to be the important criterion, the mass explosion phenomenon seems to be essentially related to the pyrotechnic composition charge of each item and therefore to some critical density of pyrotechnic composition in a given packaging assembly...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing is {{a process}} of {{converting}} raw material into product. It can be described the transformation of materials into items of greater value by means of one or more processing andJor assembly operations. The study of manufacturing was very important in order to carry out this project to ensure that student understand on what are needs to do. This project is about designing and fabricating the Exhibition Rack {{that can be used to}} display many item [...] This project involves the process of designing the exhibition rack by considering the shape, functionality, durability and manufacturing cots for people to use it. The material of this design is easy to gain it, because it only using rectangular steel, sheet metal, L- shapes steel and Perspex.

40|$|The present {{investigations}} {{deal with the}} study of the effect of water chemistry of spent fuel storage bay on corrosion properties of cladding materials of research reactor. Coupons of four different alloys of stainless steel (SS 316) and aluminium alloys (Al 6063, Al 6061 and Al 1100) in form of discs were <b>assembled</b> on a <b>rack</b> forming galvanic couples and crevice sandwiches. The rack was immersed in the spent fuel storage bay for a period of one year exposure. The monthly inspection of specimens was conducted out based on visual observation and photography. The analyses of water were done on weekly basis. After exposure of one year the rack was withdrawn and disassembled in the laboratory. The surface of each individual coupon was observed visually and by means of optical microscope. Visual observation revealed relatively more deposits of scale on aluminium samples in the galvanic couples compared to stainless steel (SS) samples. In the crevice sandwiches (Al+Al) both upper and lower samples were found almost identical with respect to scale deposits. The microscopic observations showed no pitting on any sample except at selective areas only in contact with ceramic spacers...|$|R
40|$|Conflicting reports {{implicate}} {{the scaffolding}} protein RACK 1 in {{the progression of}} breast cancer. RACK 1 {{has been identified as}} a key regulator downstream of growth factor and adhesion signalling and as a direct binding partner of PP 2 A. Our objective was to further characterise the interaction between PP 2 A and RACK 1 and to advance our understanding of this complex in breast cancer cells. We examined how the PP 2 A holoenzyme is <b>assembled</b> on the <b>RACK</b> 1 scaffold in MCF- 7 cells. We used immobilized peptide arrays representing the entire PP 2 A-catalytic subunit to identify candidate amino acids on the C subunit of PP 2 A that might be involved in binding of RACK 1. We identified the RACK 1 interaction sites on PP 2 A. Stable cell lines expressing PP 2 A with FR 69 / 70 AA, R 214 A and Y 218 F substitutions were generated and it was confirmed that the RACK 1 /PP 2 A interaction is essential to stabilise PP 2 A activity. We used Real-Time Cell Analysis and a series of assays to demonstrate that disruption of the RACK 1 /PP 2 A complex also reduces the adhesion, proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and plays a role in maintenance of the cancer phenotype. This work has significantly advanced our understanding of the RACK 1 /PP 2 A complex and suggests a pro-carcinogenic role for the RACK 1 /PP 2 A interaction. This work suggests that approaches to target the RACK 1 /PP 2 A complex are a viable option to regulate PP 2 A activity and identifies a novel potential therapeutic target in the treatment of breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIA bio-rack {{system was}} {{developed}} for treating Cu-contaminated freshwaters. Each pilot constructed wet-land (CW, 110 dm 3) contained 15 perforated vertical pipes filled {{with a mixture of}} gravel (diorite; 80 %) and perlite (20 %) and <b>assembled</b> as a <b>rack.</b> The whole experimental device consisted of 12 CW plantedeither with Phragmites australis, Phalaris arundinacea or Juncus articulatus, and unplanted as control (intriplicates). All plants were sampled at a Cu-contaminated site. The CWs were filled with a mix of freshwa-ter (30 %) from the Jalle d’Eysines River (Bordeaux, France) and tap water (70 %). Water was spiked with Cu(2. 5 M, 158. 5 g L− 1). Three CW batches were carried out, i. e. in early spring (March, S# 1), beginning ofthe growing season (May, S# 2), and peak growing season (June, S# 3). The S# 3 water was initially acidifiedto pH 6. For all batches, water was recirculated in the CW during 14 days. Physico-chemical parameters(pH, electrical conductivity, redox potential, BOD 5 and Cu 2 +concentrations) were measured every threedays. Water pH of both S# 1 and # 2 ranged between 7. 8 and 8. 5 for all treatments during the experi-ment. Initial and final total Cu concentrations were analysed for all CWs and batches. Relative TreatmentEfficiency Index (RTEI) indicated the plant effect compared to the unplanted CW. Free Cu 2 +removal was< 10 % for all S# 1 treatments (RTEI ranged between 0 and − 1) whereas it increased to 77 % (RTEI = 0. 1) inS# 2 for P. arundinacea. In acidic conditions (S# 3), Cu 2 +removal was 99 % for all treatments (RTEI = 0). ForS# 1 and S# 2, highest total Cu removal occurred in CW planted with P. arundinacea (respectively 52 % and 68 %, RTEI = 0. 1 and 0. 2). For S# 3, total Cu removal peaked up to 90 % in the unplanted CW. The RTEI valuessuggested no beneficial effect of macrophytes on Cu removal at short term. Conversely, the CW plantedwith J. articulatus generally displayed a lower efficiency. The lowest value for total Cu concentration inwater after the 14 -day period was 13 g L− 1 in S# 3 unplanted and planted with P. arundinacea. The roleof the biofilm as a key-player of Cu removal in such bio-racks is discussed. This work was financially supported by AXA foundation (PhDgrant of L.
