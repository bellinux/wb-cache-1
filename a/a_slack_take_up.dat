40|$|Key points: The human {{gastrocnemius}} {{muscle is}} slack at its shortest lengths in vivo. We hypothesised {{that when the}} muscle is lengthened <b>slack</b> is <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> progressively, first in some muscle fascicles, then in others. A new, quasi-three-dimensional ultrasound imaging method {{was used to test}} this hypothesis directly. Contrary to our prediction, the <b>slack</b> was <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> nearly simultaneously in muscle fascicles located throughout the gastrocnemius muscle. Dynamic three-dimensional reconstructions indicated that, over the range of lengths that was investigated, passive changes in the length of gastrocnemius muscle-tendon units are due to changes in the length of both muscle fascicles and tendinous structures, in approximately equal measure. Changes in the alignment of muscle fascicles and the curvature of aponeuroses have a negligible contribution to change in muscle length. These findings give insights into how skeletal muscles change their lengths in vivo. The mechanisms by which skeletal muscles lengthen and shorten are potentially complex. When the relaxed human gastrocnemius muscle is at its shortest in vivo lengths it falls slack (i. e. it does not exert any passive tension). It has been hypothesised that when the muscle is passively lengthened, <b>slack</b> is progressively <b>taken</b> <b>up,</b> first in some muscle fascicles then in others. Two-dimensional imaging methods suggest that, once the <b>slack</b> is <b>taken</b> <b>up,</b> changes in muscle length are mediated primarily by changes in the lengths of the tendinous components of the muscle. The aims of this study were to test the hypothesis that there is progressive engagement of relaxed muscle fascicles, and to quantify changes in the length and three-dimensional orientation of muscle fascicles and tendinous structures during passive changes in muscle length. Ultrasound imaging was used to determine the location, in an ultrasound image plane, of the proximal and distal ends of muscle fascicles at 14 sites in the human gastrocnemius muscle as the ankle was rotated passively through its full range. A three-dimensional motion analysis system recorded the location and orientation of the ultrasound image plane and the leg. These data were used to generate dynamic three-dimensional reconstructions of the architecture of the muscle fascicles and aponeuroses. There was considerable variability in the measured muscle lengths at which the <b>slack</b> was <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> in individual muscle fascicles. However, that variability was not much greater than the error associated with the measurement procedure. An analysis of these data which took into account the possible correlations between errors showed that, contrary to our earlier hypothesis, muscle fascicles are not progressively engaged during passive lengthening of the human gastrocnemius. Instead, the <b>slack</b> is <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> nearly simultaneously in all muscle fascicles. Once the muscle is lengthened sufficiently to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> the <b>slack,</b> about half of the subsequent increase in muscle length is due to elongation of the tendinous structures and half is due to elongation of muscle fascicles, at least over the range of muscle-tendon lengths that was investigated (up to ~ 60 or 70 % of the range of in vivo lengths).

Nevertheless, the various issues of small coins, at that time not redeemed by the government, caused another glut in commerce, which was not completely broken until the Act of March 3, 1871, allowed redemption of cents and other minor coins in lots of $20 or more. Pursuant to this act, over thirty million copper-nickel cents, of both the Indian Head and Flying Eagle designs, were redeemed; the Mint melted these for recoinage.

30|$|Another {{reason for}} shorter L FASC could be adaptations of the tendon. Although no {{significant}} changes in fascicle and muscle extensibility were noted, the extensibility of the tendon increased. Still, {{we did not observe}} changes in L TEND defined as a straight line from the heel marker to the MTJ. However, in absence of instrumented measures for the applied tension during passive stretch, this measure ignores slack. Consequently, we generally underestimated L TEND at small degrees of MTU stretch and overestimated its extensibility. Slack is usually surpassed shortly beyond neutral ankle alignment in TD [32]. In our data, only 2 – 3  % of tendon extensibility in TD children would be noted above that point, which confirms previous reports about intrinsic tendon tissue strain [39]. Moreover, during maximum MTU stretch, when all <b>slack</b> is <b>taken</b> <b>up,</b> no changes in L TEND of children with CP were noted, which could suggest that no major changes in L TEND occurred. Assuming that the tendon could have initially gotten more compliant during bracing, such as observed in growing animals [23, 24], the spastic fascicles were unstrained, which can trigger loss of sarcomeres [21, 22] and would fit the reductions in L FASC. Although intrinsic tendon properties are cumbersome to measure, more detailed information is necessary to clarify this.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{influence}} of muscle-tendon complex stretch on electromechanical delay (EMD) in terms of the extent of tendon slack in the human medial gastrocnemius (MG). EMD and MG tendon length were measured at each of five ankle joint angles (- 30 •,- 20 •,- 10 •, 0 • and 5 •: positive values for dorsiflexion) using percutaneous electrical stimulation and ultrasonography, respectively. The extent of MG tendon slack was calculated as MG tendon length shortening, standardized with MG tendon slack length obtained at the joint angle (- 16 •± 5 •) where the passive ankle joint torque was zero. EMD at- 30 • (19. 2 ± 2. 2 ms) and- 20 • (17. 2 ± 1. 3 ms) was significantly greater than that at- 10 • (16. 0 ± 2. 3 ms), 0 • (15. 0 ± 1. 4 ms) and 5 • (14. 8 ± 1. 4 ms), and at 0 • and 5 •, respectively. The relative EMD, normalized with the maximal EMD for each subject, decreased dependent on the extent of decrease in MG tendon slack.

The second Joey Negro single, the Above & Beyond EP, helped Lee secure a major label deal when he signed to Virgin Records dance offshoot Ten. One of the songs from the EP, [...] "Take Me Higher", eventually became a Top 40 hit when it was re-worked and re-sung by Debbie French under the title [...] "Do What You Feel". In 1993, Lee was approached by boy band Take Thats label with a view to working together. Although the Dan Hartman song [...] "Relight My Fire" [...] had never been a hit in the UK, it had become a popular club track on the House music scene, so at Lee’s suggestion they covered it, with Lulu taking the cameo role that Loleatta Holloway had performed on the original. It became only their second number one in the UK. The same year saw the release of the Joey Negro album Universe Of Love, featuring an all-star cast that included Gwen Guthrie and The Trammps, its title track, with live instrumentation, prefiguring much of the work he went on to do with the Sunburst Band. During some downtime at the studio, Lee and partner Andrew ‘Doc’ Livingstone wrote a song, [...] "Girls & Boys", which was so different from their previous output that they decided to create a new, anonymous, label to release it. Hed Boys’ [...] "Girls & Boys" [...] swiftly became the hottest 12-inch in the country, with major labels falling over themselves to sign this mysterious track.
