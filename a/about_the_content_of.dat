25|$|The US State {{department}} has similarly raised concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> textbooks used in PA schools. In its 2009 Human Rights report, the U.S. State Department wrote {{that after a}} 2006 revision of textbooks by the PA Ministry of Education and Higher Education, international academics concluded that books did not incite violence against Jews but showed imbalance, bias, and inaccuracy. The examples given {{were similar to those}} given by IPCRI.|$|E
25|$|On 10 January 2006, the BBC {{showed a}} drama/documentary retelling {{the story in}} the series Surviving Disaster. However, the {{programme}} was met with criticism from former United winger Albert Scanlon, who claimed that it was full of inaccuracies despite the production having consulted him <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the documentary. Errors in the programme included the depiction of Jimmy Murphy giving a pre-match team talk in Belgrade, despite him being in Cardiff at the time, and the plane being shown as only half full when nearly every seat was occupied.|$|E
25|$|Women Against Pornography's best-known tactic was {{a guided}} tour of the {{pornography}} and prostitution outlets in Times Square, which they led twice a week for a suggested contribution of $5.00. (In San Francisco, WAVPM had conducted similar tours in the red-light districts of that city.) Lynn Campbell suggested that people who did not consume pornography knew very little <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the pornography or the atmosphere in sex shops and live sex shows, and that actual guided tours of the sex industry in Times Square would provide an excellent educational tool. Susan Brownmiller planned an itinerary for the tour and wrote a script for the guides (with the help of information supplied by Carl Weisbrod, a police officer tasked with finding and closing down underground brothels in Midtown, and Maggie Smith, the owner of a neighborhood bar). The tours often involved unplanned encountersâ€”being physically thrown out by enraged store managers, watching businessmen try to hide from the tourists, or talking briefly with nude performers while they took their breaks. After a reporter for The New York Times took one of the first tours and wrote a feature article for the Style section, WAP received coverage in People, Time, The Philadelphia Inquirer, European newspapers, local TV news programs and talk shows in New York City, and The Phil Donahue Show in Chicago.|$|E

500|$|Magna Carta carries little legal {{weight in}} modern Britain, {{as most of}} its clauses have been {{repealed}} and relevant rights ensured by other statutes, but the historian James Holt remarks that {{the survival of the}} 1215 charter in national life is a [...] "reflexion of the continuous development of English law and administration" [...] and symbolic of the many struggles between authority and the law over the centuries. The historian W. L. Warren has observed that [...] "many who knew little and cared less <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the Charter have, in nearly all ages, invoked its name, and with good cause, for it meant more than it said".|$|E
500|$|Every Treehouse of Horror episode {{opens with}} a special {{introductory}} segment. The first, second and fifth Treehouse of Horror episodes open with Marge standing on a stage and warning parents <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the episode, advising them to put their children to bed. The warning in the first episode was put in as a sincere effort to warn young viewers, as the producers felt it was somewhat scary. The entire segment was a parody of {{the opening of the}} 1931 film Frankenstein. Marge's warnings quickly became a burden to write. After [...] "Treehouse of Horror V", they were permanently dropped and the writers did not make any attempts at reviving them.|$|E
500|$|Al-Tamimi, {{during his}} trial, {{repeatedly}} questioned {{the legitimacy of}} the Israeli military court trying him as well as Israeli regulations regarding public gatherings. The military judge ultimately found him guilty of sending stone-throwers and illegal protesting but cleared him of the two more serious charges. She stated that testimony from a 14-year-old witness had been inconsistent and therefore unusable and that she had found misrepresentations by interrogators <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the confession of another witness. Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak described al-Tamimi's partial exoneration as a [...] "miracle" [...] given the 99.74 percent conviction rate of the military court. Before his sentencing al-Tamimi stated that [...] "the laws come from an occupying regime whose legitimacy I do not recognise. I don't think even for a single minute {{that there is going to}} be justice done." [...] His lawyer denied al-Tamimi's involvement in stone throwing, stating that al-Tamimi believed in passive resistance.|$|E

500|$|Until {{her death}} in 1939, Sadler's wife Lena was a regular forum participant. One member {{subsequently}} objected to Sadler's leadership, alleging that he became hungry for power after his wife's death. In the early 1950s, the Urantia Foundation was established to publish The Urantia Book. [...] Hubert Wilkins, a friend of Sadler who had {{a keen interest in}} the book, contributed the initial funding for publication costs. Rather than create an organized religion, the foundation's leadership opted for what they called [...] "slow growth"; early adherents sought to educate people about the book's teachings rather than found a church-like organization. Sadler also disavowed proselytizing and publicity, although he wrote several works <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> The Urantia Book. In 1958, Sadler published a defense of the book, citing his experience exposing frauds and maintaining that the book was free of contradictions. Since his death, several reading groups, seminars, and churches have been established to study the book and to spread its message.|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} the installment's origins, producer Glen Morgan {{said that he}} [...] "wanted an episode with more of a sexy edge". It proved difficult to portray sex as convincingly scary, which caused the producers to introduce the concept of [...] "people like the Amish who are from another planet". [...] "Gender Bender" [...] was penned by freelance writers Larry and Paul Barber, whose initial draft focused heavily on {{the contrast between the}} farming community of the Kindred and a version of city life [...] "with very sexual connotations", influenced by the works of Swiss artist H. R. Giger. This script went through various rewrites during the development process, including the removal of a scene where someone's crotch rots away, to address concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the episode. The chants uttered by the Kindred were not in the script handed in by the Barbers; they were added later by producer Paul Rabwin.|$|E
500|$|ABC was {{concerned}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the episode, {{arguing that the}} idea that the story could be all in Hurley's head was offering an explanation for the show as a whole, since a recurring theory among the fandom was that the events of the series were hallucinations. The character of Dave {{was meant to be a}} side of Hurley who felt he had no problem, and encourages Hurley to overeat, and is played by Evan Handler in a way director Jack Bender described as [...] "mischievous, impish-like". Showrunner Carlton Cuse revealed his name comes from Hurley's father, David Reyes - who would later appear in the series played by Cheech Marin - because the writers [...] "wanted Hurley to imagine a friend and have that be wrapped up in his unresolved relationship with his dad". The final scene with Libby was so secret that only Jack Bender and his assistant director had it in their scripts, and to prevent Libby from being the only woman in the mental institution, every woman on the set, including Bender's daughter Sophie, was dressed in robes and pajamas to appear as background characters.|$|E

500|$|In {{the final}} pages, Raskolnikov, who {{at this point}} is in the prison infirmary, has a feverish dream about a plague of nihilism, that enters Russia and Europe from the east and which spreads {{senseless}} dissent (Raskolnikov's name alludes to [...] "raskol", dissent) and fanatic dedication to [...] "new ideas": it finally engulfs all of mankind. Though we don't learn anything <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> these ideas they clearly disrupt society forever and are seen as exclusively critical assaults on ordinary thinking: it is clear that Dostoyevsky was envisaging the new, politically and culturally nihilist ideas which were entering Russian literature and society in this watershed decade and with which Dostoyevsky would be in debate {{for the rest of his}} life (cp. Chernyshevsky's What Is to Be Done?, Dobrolyubov's abrasive journalism, Turgenev's Fathers and Sons and Dostoyevsky's own The Possessed). Janko Lavrin, who took part in the revolutions of the World War I era, knew Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky and many others, and later would spend years writing and researching on Dostoyevsky and other Russian classics, called this final dream [...] "prophetic in its symbolism".|$|E
500|$|While Labour {{distributed}} ballot packs to its members, {{the trade}} unions {{were responsible for}} sending out literature relating to the contest to their members, leading to concerns from each side <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the other's election material. After Labour included only the endorsements of parliamentarians in an information booklet sent to individual members, the Unite union wrote to Iain McNicol, the party's general secretary, to ask why details of support from organisations, such as trade unions, was omitted. Unite said that the decision unfairly favoured Murphy, and the union suggested that it and other unions would make a formal complaint, if necessary. Pat Rafferty, secretary of Unite's Scottish branch, described the incident as [...] "a gross error of judgment". On 30 November, Sunday Herald journalist Paul Hutcheon reported that along with voting packs, Unite had also sent its members a [...] "mock ballot paper" [...] instructing them to vote for Findlay and Clark, while the GMB union had also included material endorsing Findlay and Clark as their preferred candidates. Hutcheon quoted an unnamed senior Labour Party source, who described the actions as [...] "absolutely desperate stuff from Unite".|$|E
