5|$|Black grass-dart {{butterfly}} (Ocybadistes knightorum) is {{a butterfly}} of the Hesperiidae family. It is endemic to New South Wales. It has <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> {{distribution in the}} Boambee area.|$|E
5|$|Those species {{endemic to}} <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> area are often most {{threatened}} by the collection of plants from the wild. D. madagascariensis is considered endangered in Madagascar because of the large-scale removal of plants from the wild for exportation; 10 - 200 million plants are harvested for commercial medicinal use annually.|$|E
5|$|As these laudes {{were to be}} {{performed}} with <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> accompaniment of instruments, they were supposedly performed from the small loft in the high choir of the Thomaskirche, opposite to the large organ loft where the other movements of the Magnificat were performed. The autograph of the E-flat major version of the Magnificat (BWV 243a) suggests that Bach intended to perform {{the first version of}} his Magnificat also without the laudes, depending on circumstances, for example on other feasts than Christmas.|$|E

5|$|Attachment is {{the binding}} {{of the virus}} to {{specific}} molecules {{on the surface of}} the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.|$|E
5|$|Charcoal {{can be made}} by slow {{pyrolysis}} of wood by heating it in {{the absence}} of air in a kiln. The carefully stacked branches, often oak, are burned with <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> amount of air. The process of converting them into charcoal takes about fifteen hours. Charcoal is used as a fuel in barbecues and by blacksmiths and has many industrial and other uses.|$|E
5|$|However, Rome still {{controlled}} only <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> {{area and}} the affairs of Rome were minor even to those in Italy and Rome's affairs were only just coming {{to the attention of}} the Greeks, the dominant cultural force at the time. At this point the bulk of Italy remained in the hands of Latin, Sabine, Samnite and other peoples in the central part of Italy, Greek colonies to the south, and the Celtic people, including the Gauls, to the north.|$|E

In a typical day he would wake at 7am, paint from around 9 or 10am until 4pm, after which {{he would have a}} meal. Following the meal he would take a walk, and attend life classes between 6 and 8pm. On returning home he would drink two cups of tea, and go to bed at midnight.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the human}} history of South Dakota was shaped by its geology. Gold seekers founded most of the larger cities around the Black Hills, and {{quarrying}} was an important economic activity in several areas in eastern South Dakota. Mines and quarries in present-day South Dakota produce gold, Sioux quartzite, Milbank granite, sand, gravel, limestone, mica, and uranium. The state also produces <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> amount of oil and natural gas.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} {{physical}} dividers between the sites occupied by individual oligonucleotides, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> {{space on the}} surface of the microarray (one oligonucleotide sequence occupies a square 25×25μm) and the requirement of high fidelity of oligonucleotide synthesis dictate the use of site-selective 5'-deprotection techniques. In one approach, the removal of the 5'-O-DMT group is effected by electrochemical generation of the acid at the required site(s). Another approach uses 5'-O-(α-methyl-6-nitropiperonyloxycarbonyl) (MeNPOC) protecting group, which can be removed by irradiation with UV light of 365nm wavelength.|$|E
30|$|Previous work, {{mostly in}} the area of Facility Location Problems (FLPs) [9], has {{considered}} optimal base station placement for coverage optimization, which is typically addressed as a design problem and shown to be NP-complete. Centralized approximation algorithms have been developed that achieve close-to-optimal solutions in a relatively fixed scenario, but the need for global network information makes them unsuitable for coping with the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of next-generation wireless networks. Also, backbone connectivity is usually assumed to be guaranteed by a fixed backbone infrastructure, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>limiting</b> assumption in <b>a</b> dynamic wireless scenario.|$|R

5|$|The {{final stage}} {{occurs when a}} massive star begins {{producing}} iron. Since iron nuclei are more tightly bound than any heavier nuclei, any fusion beyond iron does not produce a net release of energy. To <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> degree such a process proceeds, but it consumes energy. Likewise, since they are more tightly bound than all lighter nuclei, such energy cannot be released by fission.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{programmed}} by Tod Frye, who was given <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> time frame by Atari {{to complete the}} project. The technical differences between the Atari 2600 console and the original's arcade hardware—particularly the amount of available memory—presented several challenges to Frye. Given {{the popularity of the}} property, Atari produced approximately 12million units (which was more than the estimated number of Atari 2600 consoles sold at the time), anticipating a high number of sales.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship had}} <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> service life. At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, she was the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron, based in Taranto. But due to the policy of restraint adopted by the Italian Navy, Dante Alighieri and the other battleships of the Italian fleet saw no action. Financial limitations in the post-war period forced the navy to scrap the ship to reduce the naval budget. The ship was accordingly stricken on 1 July 1928 and sold for scrap.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} poorly {{constructed}} {{and as a}} result had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> service career. She was heavily modified after her delivery to Prussia in 1865 and briefly served with the fleet between 1866 and 1871. During the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–1871, the ship was assigned as a guard ship in Hamburg. After the war, it was discovered that the internal wood construction was badly rotted; she was therefore removed from service in October 1871. Prinz Adalbert was stricken from the naval register in May 1878 and broken up for scrap that year.|$|E
5|$|The {{stadium is}} located within walking {{distance}} of the city center. There is no public transport that serves the arena, but all city and regional buses serve the city center's bus terminal, which is {{within walking distance}}. On game days, Aukra Auto operates a bus service from Aukra, while Nettbuss operates from Eidsvåg, Kleive, Batnfjordsøra and Sjøholt. Tide Sjø operates a fast ferry to Helland and Vikebukt. There are <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> number of parking spaces at the stadium, and these are limited to holders of VIP tickets.|$|E
5|$|At least 1300 cicada {{species are}} {{distributed}} worldwide {{with the majority}} being in the tropics. Most genera are restricted to a single biogeographical region and many species have <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> range. This high degree of endemism {{has been used to}} study the biogeography of complex island groups such as in Indonesia and the Orient. There are about 200 described species in Australia and New Zealand, around 150 in South Africa, over 170 in America north of Mexico, at least 800 in Latin America, and over 200 in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. About 100 species occur in the Palaearctic. A few species are found in southern Europe, and a single species is in England, the New Forest cicada, Melampsalta montana, which also occurs in continental Europe.|$|E

This is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>limiting</b> position, Freundel pointed out, since there must be serious danger to the mother. This does, however, also include cases where there is significant psychological trauma, wherein continuing the pregnancy could inflict significant or mortal harm to the mother in that fashion (such as a rape victim who becomes suicidal). Freundel {{believed that}} there is no way, under Jewish law, to allow partial-birth abortion, since once the head has emerged, the baby is considered to be born.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, women had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> legal status. A married woman had few property rights and could not make a will without her husband's permission, although jurists expected this to be given. Men had considerable latitude in disciplining the women under their authority and although a handful of cases turn up in higher courts, and the kirk session did intervene to protect women from domestic abuse, it was usually only when the abuse began to disturb public order. The criminal courts refused to recognise women as witnesses, or as independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. As a result, a married woman could not sell property, sue in court or make contracts without her husband's permission.|$|E
5|$|Carey's {{actions were}} given mixed reception, with critics and {{executives}} both commending her bold actions towards a song she felt {{needed to be}} heard, while others criticized her for publicizing the scandal further.
