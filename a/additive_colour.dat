The screen is covered by tiny pixels, each with three fluorescent elements for creating red, green and blue light. If the red, blue and green elements all glow at once, the pixel looks white. As the screen is scanned from behind with electrons, each pixel creates its own designated colour, composing a complete picture on the screen.|$|E

Both Dioptichrome and Dufaycolor worked on the same principles as the Autochrome process, but achieved their results using a layer of tiny colour filter elements arrayed in a regular geometric pattern, unlike the Autochrome's random array of coloured starch grains.The manufacture of Dufaycolor film ended in the late 1950s.|$|E

40|$|<b>Colour</b> <b>additives</b> were {{recognized}} {{early days of}} the century. They were used to: restore the colour of processed food, to enhance the appeal of certain foods and for preservation and improvement of appearance of food. <b>Colour</b> <b>additives</b> approved for use in food had been evaluated and given an E-number (signifies approval of additives by European Union(EU)), and as a consequence a list of permitted colours that satisfies the purity criteria was defined and an acceptable daily intake (ADI) was allocated. It was approved that the misuse of <b>colour</b> <b>additives</b> had accumulative effects and leads to chronic disease. This study aimed to determine the types of colours added to traditionally prepared sweets collected from Molid Elnabawi festivals at Khartoum state and to investigate whether the added colours are permitted for use as food additives. 150 different samples of traditionally prepared Halwa Molid were collected from Molid Elnabawi festivals at Khartoum, Khartoum North and Omdurman cities during May 2005 using the mathematical method of sampling which stated that the representative samples equal the square root of the total numbers of samples. The samples were analyzed for identification of <b>colour</b> <b>additives</b> used. The analysis of the samples was carried out according to the qualitative method, using paper chromatography technique. The result of the analysis showed that, only four samples (2. 67 %) contain natural colour, 99 samples (66 %) contain synthetic permitted food colour and 47 samples (31. 33 %) contain unidentified food colour. Therefore these results indicated that there should be strict control by government health authorities for manufacturing and selling such types of sweets and the consumers should be informed of the risks and hazards caused by the unpermitted <b>colour</b> <b>additives...</b>|$|R
50|$|Claude's father William {{began the}} {{development}} of an <b>additive</b> <b>colour</b> film process called Biocolour. This process produced the illusion of true colour by exposing each alternate frame of ordinary black-and-white film stock through two different coloured filters. Each alternate frame of the monochrome print was then stained red or green. Although the projection of Biocolour prints did provide a tolerable illusion of true colour, it suffered from noticeable colour flicker (a potentially headache-inducing defect known technically as 'colour bombardment') and from red-and-green fringing around anything in the scene that moved very rapidly. In an attempt to overcome these problems, a faster-than-usual frame rate was used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] The pure lac dye is {{obtained}} by dissolving technical grade lac dye in mild alkali for removal of insolubles, followed by acidification of the filtrate and finally keeping it for 8 days {{to complete the}} process of crystallization. The crystallized dye is filtered, washed and dried (yield approx. 0. 25 % on the weight of sticklac, Purity 95 % and above). The purified lac dye is bright reddish in colour and soluble in cold water. The pure lac dye has a great potential as a food <b>additive</b> for <b>colouring</b> food materials as it gives deep orange-red colour in aqueous solution like the colour of beverages and cold drinks available in market. Use of synthetic colours in the food products come to be looked upon with certain amount of apprehension {{with regard to their}} safety. Hence, lac dye could serve as a good substitute for the synthetic food colours. The potential of lac dye as food <b>additive</b> for <b>colouring</b> food material is further authenticated by the toxicological studies conducted at ITRC, Lucknow and AIIH&PH, Kolkata. The findings of these studies also support that the lac dye is non toxic at the limit test dose of 200 mg/kg diet i. e. 0. 02 % of the diet for acute oral toxicity as intake of lac dye 0. 02 % in diet for 90 days in male rats does not show any sign of toxic manifestation.

The spectrum of visible white light ranges from about λ= 400 nm to λ= 700 nm. (λ: wavelength; measured in a vacuum; 1 nm = 10 - 9 m). The spectrum is here schematically divided into three thirds. Coloured lights with a spectrum corresponding {{to a third of}} the spectrum of white light in long wavelengths appears red in intermediate wavelengths appears green in short wavelengths appears blue Combining these three lights, in various proportions, results in a large range of colours and can also give white light. Combining two of these lights in the correct proportion respectively gives a light that is- yellow, if green light and red light are added- cyan, if green light and blue light are added- magenta, if red light and blue light are added These rules stem from the existence of three kinds of receptors – cones- on the retina and of a complex integration of the corresponding responses in the visual system...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{preliminary}} investigation towards the design of effective colour spaces and colour tools to allow users to quickly and accurately select a given colour in a digital-display environment. It {{has been shown that}} many non-expert users find the RGB colour space to be non-intuitive. The choice of colour space on various visual tasks has also been shown to be an important factor and that experts show greater precision in colour-matching experiments than non-expert observers. We propose that non-experts find manipulation and selection in an RGB colour space to be difficult because they do not possess an appropriate internal model for <b>additive</b> <b>colour</b> mixing. On the other hand, observers from a young age may develop a useful internal model of subtractive colour mixing processes as they experiment with inks and paints. The purpose of this work is to determine whether it is indeed the case that observers possess more useful internal models for subtractive colour mixing than for <b>additive</b> <b>colour</b> mixing. The work reported in this study describes only an assessment of subtractive colour mixing. Three experiments are described whereby expert and naïve observers select matches from a library of colours for individual samples or for imagined subtractive mixtures of paint samples. Qualitative and quantitative analyses are presented to measure the ability of observers to make predictions of subtractive mixing processes. When mixing the subtractive primaries (e. g. cyan with magenta) the performance of expert and naïve observers are the same but in general the expert performance far exceeds that of the naïve observer for other colours...|$|E

40|$|In {{this chapter}} the {{importance}} of colour as a design, marketing and sales tool for industry is outlined {{to substantiate the need}} for a strong knowledge of colour and the need to work confidently and proficiently with colour. The chapter is designed in a manner that promotes knowledge development and inspiration, and for the more proactive reader a rich experience of colour can be gained by working through the chapter activities, initially at a computer and later with pigments (paints, dyes), which is highly encouraged and recommended. This workshop approach enables you to experiment with colour mixing and colour schemes to better appreciate colour and its application, without which the theories become just a concept; there really is little substitute for experimentation. A short history of colour is given that focuses on the building of the scientific underpinning of the most predominant theories of colour used today in relation to textile-based products (fashion).
