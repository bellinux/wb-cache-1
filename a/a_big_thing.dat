The reason I was using that concept so much at that point in my life – in 1968, 1969 or so – was because it was a discovery for me. I grew up kind of only thinking how much fun it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not even think about a relationship to an audience, really, until way later.|$|E

At {{the time of}} the meeting, Haug had recently formed Powderfinger with high school friends John Collins and Steven Bishop, who would become the band's foundational bass guitarist and drummer, respectively. Haug was the lead guitarist and lead singer. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman. Haug stated that [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> to convince the others that we needed a singer. They were like, 'You're OK,' and I was like, 'No I'm not.

It wasn’t really anything I planned. I wasn’t even ready for this to be <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> because I’ve had tracks out before. I put my all into everything, but sometimes some tracks come out better than others. It got such a big buzz maybe because it came out the day after and people enjoyed it.” ...|$|E

500|$|Hoffman {{was long}} {{regarded}} as one of the great teammates in baseball. He was known as a leader in the clubhouse and a tutor to younger players. He mentored his successor in San Diego, Heath Bell, and the pitcher who supplanted him in Milwaukee, John Axford. [...] "Just watching him go about his business was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> to me", Bell said. In his first game pitching setup to Axford after losing his closer role, Hoffman stayed in the dugout to watch Axford finish. Many relievers retire back to the clubhouse after being removed from a game. Hoffman's teammates noticed that he stayed supporting Axford through a bases-loaded jam. Axford [...] spent the season absorbing Hoffman's advice, and the two bonded. [...] "He took young players under his wing, especially relief pitchers", said former Padres teammate Brad Ausmus. Hoffman regularly organized team dinners on the road or had team family gatherings at his home, whether it was with the Padres or the Brewers. [...] "It's very unusual for a pitcher, especially a relief pitcher, to be the team leader", Padres first baseman Phil Nevin said in 2002, [...] "but everybody here looks to Trevor. This is his team." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Piece of Me" [...] was filmed on November 27 and November 28, 2007, at the nightclub and {{restaurant}} Social Hollywood in Los Angeles, California. It {{was directed by}} Wayne Isham, who had previously worked with Spears on the music video of [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman". British national newspaper Daily Mail reported that the video cost $500,000, her most expensive music video since the music video for [...] "Toxic". In some scenes of the music video, Spears wore a purple satin dress from American designer Marina Toybina. Spears reportedly arrived twelve hours late to the set, after spending the day with her sons Sean Preston and Jayden James. Isham talked about the situation, saying, [...] "She was late. People made <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> about it, [...] how could she not be late, when you have 50, 65, 75 people running down the street chasing her car? That was a long day for the crew.

500|$|In July 2014, Fazekas {{stated that}} it was [...] "fabulous from a writing perspective" [...] to have an eight episode order, as [...] "you can plan it and know where you're heading... They're all their own stories {{and they all have}} their own drive, but it's sort of {{building}} toward <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> {{at the end of the}} eight episodes." [...] Elaborating on this, Atwell said, [...] "it's incredibly tight, the script, which is great. It's fast moving and fast paced but luckily because it's not stretched out of 22 episodes, nothing is diluted. Every line is vital to not only moving the story and the action [...] but also developing the characters." [...] The season's overarching storyline revolves around the chemical weapon Midnight Oil, which is based on the Madbomb of the Captain America comics. The Madbomb was originally considered for use in , before negotiations with actors to adapt the [...] "Civil War" [...] storyline were completed. Also in July, it was revealed that Carter's husband would be explored in the series. However, he was ultimately not explored much in the first season, with McFeely saying, [...] "This was the season where she says goodbye to Steve ... In a second season, she could be freer to have those conversations about a life after him." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Renner, {{who played}} the film's adult Hansel, has stated that his initial {{attraction}} came from a one sheet he was given even before seeing the script, showing Hansel and Gretel walking away and a witch burning at {{a stake in the}} background, which he found [...] "incredibly interesting" [...] (this scene was included in the finished film). He added, [...] "When I read the script, my first thought was, 'I can’t believe this hasn’t been done yet.' It’s such a great idea with so much potential. That dynamic was definitely <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>thing,</b> I loved that what Tommy [...] wrote left so much room for character." [...] Wirkola said he wanted Renner in the role after seeing him in The Hurt Locker. Wirkola, who described Hansel as the [...] "loose cannon" [...] of the duo, gave him an additional character flaw of diabetes, in addition to the psychological scars that Hansel shares with his sister (in the original idea for the short film, Gretel was also suffering from eating disorder). Renner said it was a great escape for him [...] "as this was a fairytale with no stress like the other action movies I'd done recently. I was having so much fun hanging on a wire like Peter Pan, hanging onto a broom and doing other crazy stuff." [...] He stated, [...] "That {{was one of the most}} fun jobs I’ve ever had because there’s something magical about that old world, fantasy thing." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{reporter}} for the Daily Planet newspaper and the love interest of Clark Kent. Adams was selected {{from a list of}} actresses that included Olivia Wilde and Mila Kunis. [...] "There was a big, giant search for Lois," [...] Snyder said. [...] "For us, it was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> and obviously a really important role. We did a lot of auditioning, but we had this meeting with Amy Adams and after that I just felt she was perfect for it." [...] Adams auditioned for the role three times: once for the unproduced Superman: Flyby, and the second time for Superman Returns before landing the current role. Adams was confirmed to play Lois Lane in March 2011. While announcing the role, Snyder said in a statement, [...] "We are excited to announce the casting of Amy Adams, one of the most versatile and respected actresses in films today. Amy has the talent to capture all of the qualities we love about Lois: smart, tough, funny, warm, ambitious and, of course, beautiful." [...] On portraying Lois Lane, Adams stated that the film would feature a Lois Lane who is an [...] "independent, feisty woman ... but set in a more identifiable world." [...] Adams said that [...] "She has become more of a free-ranging journalist, someone who likes to be hands-on. The nature of the newspaper business has changed so much. There is so much more pressure." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{noted by}} {{interviewer}} Kurt Wolff, [...] "the melody and overall {{sound of the}} song also stand out as something fresh and very different." [...] Tompkins explained to Wolff that [...] "Blown Away" [...] was an [...] "attempt at 'melodic pop' that was 'unique' yet still 'country.'" [...] Tompkins also commented that [...] "Blown Away" [...] is [...] "not even mine and Josh’s song anymore; it's [...] song now. She's completely claimed it. The song is Carrie. It's not even a song that had a chance of being pitched to anybody else. It's a completely different type of song for Carrie. She's {{got a lot of}} pop elements, and I listen to a lot of pop, but I listen to everything from Randy Newman to Mozart to Rihanna to Steely Dan. I think all that stuff shows up in my music, and I think it showed up in 'Blown Away.'" [...] The final version of the song was produced by Mark Bright, who drew inspiration from 1980s music. Underwood recalled Bright adding an effect to her vocals similar to the ones used in Def Leppard songs: [...] "That was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> with , all of that hollow vocal sound. And I liked it." [...] Bright used a similar effect on [...] "See You Again", another song from Blown Away. Melodically, [...] "Blown Away" [...] is written in the key of A minor, and is set in the common time with a tempo of 134 beats per minute. The song follows the sequence of Am - C - G as its chord progression, and Underwood's voice spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of E5.|$|E
500|$|Joseph {{increased}} {{her teaching}} commitments by often deputising for Holst, both at James Allen's and at SPGS. She also continued in her {{role of the}} composer's amanuensis, and was invited to attend the private premiere of The Planets, on 29 September 1918 at the Queen's Hall, where Adrian Boult conducted the Queen's Hall orchestra. She later wrote: [...] "From the moment of Mars... to the last sound of Neptune, it was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>thing</b> that will last all our lives, I think". She was able to draw on her classical education at Girton when she helped to translate the [...] apocryphal work The Acts of John from the original Greek, to provide the text for Holst's Hymn of Jesus (1917); for the same work she prepared a vocal score and an arrangement for piano, strings and organ. She and Holst combined to produce a women's voices version (two sopranos and an alto) of William Byrd's Mass for Three Voices, and Joseph worked alone to produce an orchestral accompaniment for Samuel Wesley's Sing Aloud with Gladness. This latter work was prepared for the 1917 Whitsun musical festival, one of an annual series of such festivals that Holst masterminded, first at his home town of [...] Thaxted, in later years at assorted venues including Dulwich, Chichester and Canterbury. Joseph became {{a key figure in}} these festivals, as organiser, performer and composer. At Thaxted in 1918 two of her compositions were performed: Hymn for female voices (now lost), and an orchestral piece, Barbara Noel's Morris, which Joseph wrote to mark her friendship with the daughter of Conrad Noel, Thaxted's vicar.|$|E
500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>thing.</b> But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E
