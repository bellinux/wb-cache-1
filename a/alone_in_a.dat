5|$|But now, I {{no longer}} pleaded for anything. I {{was no longer}} able to lament. On the contrary, I felt very strong. I was the accuser, God the accused. My eyes had opened and I was alone, terribly <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> world without God, without man. Without love or mercy.|$|E
5|$|Heydrich was, for {{all intents}} and purposes, {{military}} dictator of Bohemia and Moravia.

5|$|He {{published}} his autobiography Ray of Hope in 1993, co-authored by Dr. Andrew Lees, who {{at that time}} treated Kennedy for Parkinson's disease. Later that year he sold his collection of medals and international caps to raise funds. In 2002, he was reported as living <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bungalow in New Hartley.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to their British counterparts, the French Navy {{was in a}} state of confusion. Although the quality of the fleet's ships was high, the fleet hierarchy was riven by the same crises that had torn through France since the Revolution five years earlier. Consequently, the high standard of ships and ordnance was not matched by that of the available crews, which were largely untrained and inexperienced. With the Terror resulting in the death or dismissal of many senior French sailors and officers, political appointees and conscripts – many of whom had never been to sea at all, let <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fighting vessel – filled the Atlantic fleet.|$|E

5|$|Mary {{wished to}} retire to Castile {{and live with}} her {{recently}} widowed sister Eleanor, near Charles, who had retired.

She was afraid that Eleanor's death would leave her <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> country whose customs she did not know. In the end, she {{decided to move to}} Castile, while retaining the possibility of moving back to the Netherlands in case she could not adjust to the Castilian customs. Charles, Eleanor, and Mary sailed from Ghent on 15 September 1556.|$|E

5|$|Massachusetts was {{an early}} center of the Transcendentalist movement, which {{emphasized}} intuition, emotion, human individuality and a deeper connection with nature. Ralph Waldo Emerson, {{who was born in}} Boston but spent much of his later life in Concord, largely created the philosophy with his 1836 work Nature, and continued to be a key figure in the movement for the remainder of his life. Emerson's friend, Henry David Thoreau, who was also involved in Transcendentalism, recorded his year spent <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small cabin at nearby Walden Pond in the 1854 work Walden; or, Life in the Woods.|$|E
