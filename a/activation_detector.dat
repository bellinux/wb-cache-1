40|$|In {{the paper}} the {{application}} of effective source to the solution of <b>activation</b> <b>detector</b> activities in the reactor pressure vessel cavity of the VVER- 1000 reactor is presented. The effective source method applies the Boltzmann transport operator to time integrated source data to obtain detector activities. Weighting the source data by time dependent depletion of the detector activity, {{the result of the}} calculation is the detector activity. The approach works because of the inherent linearity of radiation transport in non-multiplying time-invariant media. Integrated in this way, the source data are referred to as the ‘effective source’. The effective source method thereby enables the analyst to replace numerous intensive transport calculations with a single transport calculation in which the time dependence and magnitude of the source are correctly represented. Detailed description of the effective source method is presented in previous works. First, there were performed neutron-physical calculations of few real VVER- 1000 cycles using MOBY-DICK macrocode. Second, there follows 3 -D transport calculation using the deterministic code TORT and the cross section library BUGLE-B 7 and obtained results are presented. These calculation results of <b>activation</b> <b>detector</b> activities in the reactor cavity are compared with relevant activation detectors results of the ex-vessel measurement. The comparison between calculation and measurement of activation detectors activity in the reactor cavity is necessary to the calculation quality verifying for further fast neutron fluence onto the reactor pressure vessel credible calculation.

40|$|Currently the {{development}} of the nuclear systems is heading to systems with fast neutrons instead of thermal ones. Such systems are mainly fast reactors of generation IV family and accelerator driven systems. Unfortunately the possibilities of monitoring fast neutrons are limited. One of the possible principles is to use activation detectors. It has shown up that yttrium is very good candidate to act as the <b>activation</b> <b>detector</b> of the fast neutrons. The advantages of yttrium are namely its (n,xn) threshold reactions and the fact that its only one naturally occurring isotope. To be possible to use yttrium as the <b>activation</b> <b>detector</b> it is necessary to know the cross-sections of the (n,xn) reactions sufficiently good. This condition is fulfilled only in case of the 89 Y(n, 2 n) 88 Y reaction. For higher orders of reactions there are almost no experimental data. For this reason a series of experiment were made using quasi mono-energetic neutron source based on the reaction of protons with 7 Li target at Nuclear Physics Institute of ASCR in Rez. Special attention was paid to the 89 Y(n, 3 n) 87 Y reaction. In this case the nuclei are produced both in the ground state and in the isomeric state. The half-lives are 79. 8 hours for the ground state and 13. 38 hours for the isomeric state. The isomeric state decays mainly through the gamma transition to the ground state. The beta decay of the isomeric state is within our accuracy negligible. The cross-sections of both cases of products were analyzed and compared with existing experimental data, calculated models and evaluated values...|$|E

Due to intensive neutron source based on spallation reaction are these systems very litle dependent on the arrangement of the core and fuel quality. These systems can transmute the spent fuel, eventually 232 Th or 238 U without affecting maintenance of fission reaction. Additionally subcritical blanket ensures high safety. For these systems it is necessary to know the cross sections of reactions of fast neutrons produced in the spallation reaction with different materials. This data is necessary not only for the selection of appropriate construction materials, but also for creation of programs simulating accelerator driven transmutation systems. This thesis is focused on the experimental determination of cross sections of reactions 89 Y(n, 2 n) 88 Y and 89 Y(n, 3 n) 87 Y with neutron energies from 17, 6 to 33, 6 MeV.

40|$|A camera obscura {{technique}} {{was used to}} investigate the spatial distribution of fusion protons emitted from a small deuterium plasma focus device operated in its neutron-optimized regime (14 kV, 3 kJ, and 400 Pa D 2 gas). An indium-foil <b>activation</b> <b>detector</b> was employed simultaneously to measure the shot-to-shot neutron yield. The camera obscura was positioned on the forward axis of the plasma focus, 12 cm {{from the tip of}} the hollow copper anode, covering a conical field-of-view of half-angle slightly less than 20 degrees. The nuclear track detector material PM- 355 was used in the camera focal plane to register protons from the ²H(d, p) ³H reaction, hence imaging the spatial distribution of fusion occurring in the plasma focus. A kapton film covering the camera entrance pupil served to protect the detector from the hot plasma jet; it also stopped completely all energetic charged particles other than the (3 MeV) fusion protons. Following chemical etching of the detector plates, the track parameters - size, circularity, average-grey-value and (x-y) position - |were measured by an automated scanning system comprising an optical microscope equiped with a CCD camera, motorized stage and focus-adjust, and interfaced to a PC computer. From the accumulated track data, representing 119 plasma focus shots, the imaged fusion density profile was obtained. A detailed Monte Carlo simulation program was used to interpret this profile. The results indicate that the beam-target mechanism, in which energetic deuterons emitted in a forwardly directed cone from the plasma focus pinch interact with the cold deuterium gas, accounts for 90 to 96 % of the fusion production for our device.

40|$|For {{this work}} a {{methodology}} {{has been developed}} to predict the sensitivity of a beryllium/scintillator fusion neutron detector. Neutrons may be captured by the beryllium via the 9 Be (n, α) 6 He nuclear reaction, where the product nucleus, 6 He, decays by beta emission. The beta particles can be detected by close coupling scintillator with the beryllium. The methodology relates beta energy deposition to absolute measured scintillation light output {{as a function of}} detector bias, reflective material, scintillator thickness, and solid angle subtended by the scintillator {{on the face of the}} PMT. Output signals were measured from thin plastic scintillator using NIST traceable beta and gamma sources and MCNP 5 was used to model the energy deposition from each source. Combining the experimental and calculated results gives the desired empirical relationships. The results from this methodology were compared with previous work and the two results were in good agreement. The empirical relationships were applied to a similar detector with much larger dimensions and very different response characteristics. The correlation between the two systems produced nearly identical results. To validate, the sensitivity of the second beryllium/scintillator-layer neutron <b>activation</b> <b>detector</b> was predicted and then exposed to a known DD neutron fluence. The neutron fluence was determined by the associated particle method from which the detector sensitivity could be inferred. The predicted and the measured sensitivity agreed within a range of 8 to 38 percent difference with an average standard deviation of 25 % from 8 total measurements. Predicting the detector performance within 25 % is adequate enough to guide future detector design decisions. To test this methodology it was applied to the design modeled after Sandia National Laboratories current beryllium detector, which was originally designed using results from a very limited set of experimental data. The results of these calculations indicated that the design was in fact optimal within the uncertainties of this work. Sandia National LaboratoriesNuclear EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|Isomeric {{activities}} were induced in indium by gamma irradiation {{in three different}} gamma fields, through the reactions 115 In([gamma], [gamma]') 115 mIn and 113 In([gamma], [gamma]') 113 mIn. The irradiation fields were (i) the 15 kCi 60 Co source available in the University, (ii) the spent fuel gamma irradiator in the pool of the University's Ford Nuclear Reactor (FNR) and (iii) south face of {{the core of the}} FNR during routine shut downs. Isomeric activation ratios can serve to characterize gamma fields, provided the response functions of the two ([gamma], [gamma]') reactions sample different energy regimes of the gamma spectrum present in the irradiation fields. The response of an isomeric <b>activation</b> <b>detector,</b> in turn, depends on the number of activation energy levels of the nuclide and the probabilities with which the activation levels de-populate to the isomeric level. The reaction rate ratio RIn 115 m/RIn 113 m was measured in the three gamma fields. The measured ratios were (i) 1. 210 +/- 0. 011 in the 60 Co source, (ii) 1. 314 +/- 0. 060 in the spent fuel gamma irradiator and (iii) 1. 298 +/- 0. 039 in a location alongside the FNR core during routine shut downs. The measured reaction rate ratios are not only close to each other, but close to unity as well. This indicates that the excitation functions for the reactions 115 In([gamma], [gamma]') 115 mIn and 113 In([gamma], [gamma]') 113 mIn have similar shapes and that for the nuclides 115 In and 113 In, the number of activation energy levels and the probabilities with which they populate the isomeric levels are very similar to each other. Thus, the ratio RIn 115 m/RIn 113 m will not yield any information regarding the shape of gamma spectrum in the field of measurement.

This paper also presents a sophisticated 9 -step process utilizing twice the coarse-scaling adjustment which can adjust a given coarse-group spectrum into a fine-group structure, i. e. 640 groups, with satisfactory continuity and excellently matched reaction rates between measurements and calculation. The spectrum adjustment algorithm applied {{in this study is}} the same as the well-known SAND-II. JRC. F. 4 -Safety of future nuclear reactor...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} thick threshold <b>activation</b> <b>detectors</b> for the characterization of low intensity neutron fields. This technique {{has been applied to}} the determination of the spectral emission of a low activity (37 GBq) Am-Be source. The reaction rates induced by the neutrons emitted by this source in different thick metallic targets (Al, Si, Fe, In) have been measured in the following reactions: 27 Al(n,p) 27 Mg, 27 Al(n,α) 24 Na, 28 Si(n,p) 28 Al, 56 Fe(n,p) 56 Mn, 115 In(n, n′) 115 mIn and 115 In(n, γ) 116 mIn. Each measured reaction rate corresponding to a threshold detector response depends on the spectral emission of the source via a correcting factor. This factor, which takes into account the source detector geometry, the neutron attenuation and diffusion by the detectors, has been determined by Monte Carlo simulation using MCNP 5 code. The spectral emission of the neutron source has been generated from the response matrix of the threshold detectors by using different neutron spectrum unfolding methods (Stayn'l, Gravel and Maxed). A fairly good agreement with the assumed ISO spectrum has been achieved...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide the {{experimental}} and theoretical background necessary to extend guidelines to ceiling heights between 9 m and 18 m. Based on the results of experiments conducted in 15 m and 22 m high hangars, <b>detector</b> <b>activation</b> thresholds and <b>detector</b> spacing are analyzed for both smoke and heat detectors. Only ceiling mounted detection devices are analyzed in this paper. In addition to the detector threshold study, the predictive capabilities of computer fire model simulations were compared with experimental results. This comparison, which is based on 12 fire tests, resulted in the development of a new ceiling jet algorithm to model phenomena which had not been included in previous algorithms. The improved algorithm provides a better representation of the development of the ceiling jet temperature to a growing hot layer and a better estimation of plume centerline temperature. Guidelines are examined, based on the experimental results, for fire detector spacing, placement, and sensitivity. Recommendations concerning the use of computer fire models at these heights are made as a function of fire size and hot layer development. The role of draft curtains is discussed and their impact on <b>detector</b> <b>activation</b> is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The {{correspondence}} problem {{arises in}} motion perception {{when more than}} one motion path is possible for discontinuously presented visual elements. Ullman’s (1979) “minimal mapping ” solution to the correspondence problem, for which costs are assigned to competing motion paths {{on the basis of}} element affinities (e. g., greater affinity for elements that are closer together), is distinguished from a solution based on the differential activation of directionally selective motion <b>detectors.</b> The differential <b>activation</b> account was supported by evidence that path length affects <b>detector</b> <b>activation</b> in a paradigm for which motion correspondence is not a factor. Effects on <b>detector</b> <b>activation</b> in this paradigm also were the basis for the successful prediction of path luminance effects on solutions to the motion correspondence problem. Finally, the differential activation account was distinguished from minimal mapping theory by an experiment showing that the perception of an element moving simultaneously in two directions does not depend on whether the two motions are matched in path-length determined affinity; it is sufficient that the <b>activation</b> of <b>detectors</b> responding to each of the two motion directions is above the threshold level required for the motions to be perceived. Implications of the differential activation solution are discussed for the stability of perceived motions once they are established, and the adaptation of perceived and unperceived motions. We thank Gregor Schöner, Cynthia Park, and three anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments. Correspondence should be addresse...|$|R
