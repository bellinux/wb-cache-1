40|$|Abstract. This study {{provides}} morphometric data on radiation-induced alterations {{of the facial}} nerve in female Wistar rats. The facial nerves were explanted 3 to 4 or 7 to 9 months after completion of a fractionated external irradiation of {{the left side of the}} neck (5 days per week, 6 weeks, total: 60 Gray). Both facial nerves were investigated in order to identify possible effects of scattered irradiation on them. A total of 54 animals were investigated and 11, 193 measurements were obtained. The computer-assisted image analysing system CUE- 3 Color Image Analyzer (Olympus, Japan) was used. Facial nerves from untreated animals served as controls. Results: Three to four months after irradiation, the ratio of <b>axon</b> <b>area</b> and total area of the cross-sectioned nerve was shifted towards the <b>axon</b> <b>area.</b> Seven to 9 months after completion of irradiation, both the myelin sheath an...|$|E

40|$|The {{streptozotocin}} (STZ) -diabetic rat, {{the most}} commonly employed model of experimental diabetic neuropathy, is characterised by a reduction in nerve conduction velocity, pain threshold and blood flow. Whether or not structural abnormalities underlie these functional abnormalities is unclear. 10 adult male Sprague–Dawley STZ-diabetic rats (diabetes duration 27 d) and 10 age-matched (23 wk) control animals were studied. Motor nerve conduction velocity (m s− 1) was significantly reduced in diabetic (41. 31 ± 0. 8) compared with control (46. 15 ± 1. 5) animals (P< 0. 001). The concentration of sciatic nerve glucose (P< 0. 001), fructose (P< 0. 001) and sorbitol (P< 0. 001) was elevated, and myoinositol (P< 0. 001) was reduced in diabetic compared with control animals. Detailed morphometric studies demonstrated {{no significant difference in}} fascicular area, myelinated fibre density, fibre and <b>axon</b> <b>areas</b> as well as unmyelinated fibre density and diameter. Endoneurial capillary density, basement membrane area and endothelial cell profile number did not differ between diabetic and control animals. However, luminal area (P< 0. 03) was increased and endothelial cell area (P< 0. 08) was decreased in the diabetic rats. We conclude there is no detectable structural basis for the reduction in nerve conduction velocity, pain threshold or blood flow, observed in the streptozotocin diabetic rat...|$|R
40|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} selects {{relevant}} signals and suppresses irrelevant stimuli {{for a given}} task through mechanisms that are not understood. We addressed this issue using as a model system the pathways from the functionally distinct prefrontal areas 10 and 32 to auditory association cortex, and investigated their relationship to inhibitory neurons labeled for calbindin (CB) or parvalbumin (PV), which differ in mode of inhibition. Projection neurons in area 10 originated mostly in layers 2 [...] 3 and were intermingled with CB inhibitory neurons. In contrast, projections from area 32 originated predominantly in layers 5 [...] 6 among PV inhibitory neurons. Prefrontal axonal boutons terminating in layers 2 [...] 3 of auditory association cortex were larger than those terminating in layer 1. Most prefrontal axons synapsed on spines of excitatory neurons but a significant number targeted dendritic shafts of inhibitory neurons. <b>Axons</b> from <b>area</b> 10 targeted CB and PV inhibitory neurons, whereas <b>axons</b> from <b>area</b> 32 targeted PV inhibitory neurons. The preferential association of the 2 prefrontal pathways with distinct classes of inhibitory neurons at their origin and termination may reflect the specialization of area 10 in working memory functions and area 32 in emotional communication.

Therefore, we hypothesized that glioblastoma cyst fluid can promote the regeneration of injured peripheral nerves. To validate this hypothesis, we transected rat sciatic nerve, performed epineural anastomosis, and wrapped the injured sciatic nerve with glioblastoma cyst fluid- or saline-soaked gelatin sponges. Neurological function and histomorphological examinations showed that compared with the rats receiving local saline treatment, those receiving local glioblastoma cyst fluid treatment had better sciatic nerve function, fewer scars, greater <b>axon</b> <b>area,</b> counts and diameter as well as fiber diameter.

40|$|Single giant axons {{from the}} lobster circumesophageal {{connective}} were studied using the sucrose gap voltage-clamp technique. The <b>axon</b> <b>area</b> {{in the gap}} was bathed in acridine orange for several minutes and then rinsed for several minutes. Subsequent illumination resulted in progressive prolongation of electrically stimulated action potentials to durations of 150 msec. The prolongation was accompanied {{by an increase in}} threshold. Currents in voltage clamp were altered such that transient current inactivation was greatly slowed. The turn on of transient current was somewhat slowed, the voltage at which peak transient current could be obtained was shifted to more positive internal potentials, and transient current at all potentials was decreased. Steady-state current was similarly affected. Low calcium following illumination partially counteracted some of the changes, but not the slowing of inactivation. Low calcium increased the duration of prolonged action potentials. Selective alteration of parameters in the Hodgkin-Huxley equations brought about a qualitative match between computations and data...|$|E
40|$|The brain {{consists}} of a complex network of axons, transmitting electrical impulses between interconnected neurons across distances that range from fractions of millimeters to meters. Myelinated axons, or nerve fibers, are axons that are wrapped by a myelin sheath, serving as an electrical insulation that increases the propagation speed of the signal along the nerve fiber while conserving the energy consumed and the space needed to maintain such propagation speed without myelin. Changes in the axon and surrounding myelin sheath during development and aging, or {{as a consequence of}} pathology, affect conduction and the proper functioning of the axon bundles. It is therefore important to be able to quantify the properties of these axons and their bundles and to discern which features best characterize the observed differences. We study the effects of aging on the myelinated axons in the fornix of the brain. The fornix is the principal subcortical output tract of the hippocampal formation, which plays a central role in memory. We obtain a collection of 328 high-quality electron micrographs from the fornix of 25 different rhesus monkey brains, ranging from young adults to the elderly, with both males and females. In this work, we develop a novel advanced recognition algorithm for automatically identifying myelinated axons and their surrounding myelin sheath. We extract multiple features of the nerve fibers and fully characterize their spatial structure. Using a feature selection algorithm, we discriminate between young and aged rhesus monkeys {{with a high level of}} accuracy and pinpoint the differences in the aging process at the ultrastructural level across the life span. We observe a decline in the density of myelinated axons as well as in the fraction of occupied <b>axon</b> <b>area</b> with age, while the average <b>axon</b> <b>area</b> shows no dependence on the age of the subjects. We show an increase in the myelin thickness of axons for the female subjects, while no dependence is observed for the male subjects. This sex dichotomy is also present in the g-ratio of the myelinated axons, i. e., the ratio of the axon diameter to the fiber diameter. The method detailed here could be adapted to enable recognition in other areas as well as for changes caused by brain pathologies or by developmental disorders. Furthermore, the data collected will ultimately be useable in better modeling conduction properties in myelinated axons and better understanding how the aging process affects them...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{investigated}} morpho-functional {{relations of the}} aortic depressor nerve (ADN) 5, 15 and 120 days after the onset of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats. Time control animals received vehicle. Under pentobarbital anesthesia, ADN activity was recorded simultaneously with arterial pressure. After the recordings, nerves were prepared for light microscopy study and morphometry. ADN function was accessed by means of pressure-nerve activity curve (fitted by sigmoidal regression) and cross-spectral analysis between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and ADN activity. The relation between morphological (myelinated fibers number and density, total myelin area, total fiber area and percentage of occupancy) and functional (gain, signal/noise relation, frequency) parameters were accessed by linear regression analysis and correlation coefficient calculations. Functional parameters obtained {{by means of the}} sigmoidal regression curve as well as by cross-spectral analysis were similar in diabetic and control rats. Morphometric parameters of the ADN were similar between groups 5 days after the onset of diabetes. Average myelin area and myelinated fiber area were significantly smaller on diabetic rats 15 and 120 days after the onset of diabetes, being the myelinated fiber and respective <b>axons</b> <b>area</b> and diameter also smaller on 120 days group. Nevertheless, G ratio (ratio between axon and fiber diameter) was nearly 0. 6 and not different between groups or experimental times. No significant relationship between morphological and functional parameters was detected in all experimental groups. The present study suggests that ADN diabetic neuropathy was time-dependent, with damage to myelinated fibers to be the primary event, not evidenced by physiological methods...|$|R
40|$|Intraoperative {{irradiation}} (IORT) is used {{to enhance}} local tumour control by using large, single doses while removing critical structures from the treatment field. Peripheral nerve remains a dose-limiting normal tissue that often cannot {{be removed from the}} field. To assess ultrastructural changes in canine sciatic nerve after IORT, computerized morphometric analysis of plastic sections and electron micrographs of nerve cross-sections was used. Surgically exposed sciatic nerves were irradiated with 6 MeV electrons to 12, 20 or 28 Gy. Twelve months after treatment dogs were killed humanely and the nerves from three dogs per dose group, including non-irradiated controls, were analyzed. Twelve months after 28 -Gy IORT a significant decrease in nerve fiber density occurred. Nerve fiber loss was particularly prominent in the central portion of the nerve predominantly among large nerve fibers. Other nerve fiber parameters including fiber and <b>axon</b> <b>area,</b> diameter and perimeter, myelin thickness, form factor (measure of roundness), and G ratio (axon diameter/fiber diameter) did not show significant, dose-related changes. An increase in microtubule and neurofilament density in irradiated nerve axons was found. These changes are suggestive of radiation-induced hypoxia (damage to microvasculature) resulting in axon damage and subsequent nerve fiber loss as a possible mechanism of late radiation injury to peripheral nerve...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} qualify and {{quantify}} nerve fiber lesion following an acute crush injury, a morphologic and morphometric study {{was carried out in}} 25 Wistar rats divided into live groups of five animals each according to the crushing load applied, i. e., 500, 1000, 5000, 10 000, and 15 000 g. The injury was produced under general anesthesia on a 5 mm-long intermediate segment of the right sciatic nerve for 10 min using a dead-weight machine. The animals were killed with an excessive dose of anesthetics 72 h later and submitted to perfusion with a fixing solution through the abdominal aorta immediately after death. Both the right and left sciatic nerves were removed and prepared for histologic and morphometric examinations: 5 mu m-thick sections stained with 1 % Toluidine blue were examined under a light microscope equipped with a video camera linked to a computer loaded with a graphic program (KS 400). The morphometric studies included measuring total number of fibers, fiber density, fiber diameter, myelin fiber area, axon diameter, <b>axon</b> <b>area</b> and G ratio. The results showed that damage to the nerve fibers began to appear as early as with the 500 g load and was similar in all groups despite the load applied, increasing with the 10000 and 15000 g loads, although the external supporting tissues and small diameter fibers were preserved. The predominant type of lesion produced was axonotmesis. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{exercise}} on the myelination {{and growth of}} axons in the nerve to the soleus muscle (NSM) was investigated in young male Wistar rats. Experimental animals were run on a treadmill for 13 weeks (70 min/day, 6 days/week), while sedentary weight-matched animals {{of the same age}} and sex served as controls. The activity of the enzymes, phosphofructokinase (PFK) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) were measured in the soleus muscle to assess the effects of training on the anaerobic glycolytic and oxidative capacities. Axon and myelin sheath cross-sectional areas were measured from electron micrograph montages of the whole NSM {{with the aid of a}} digitizing tablet. The exercise programme produced large adaptive increases in the capacity of the soleus muscle for both oxidative and anaerobic glycolytic metabolism. The specific activity of PFK and SDH increased in the soleus muscle of exercised animals by 42. 8 % and 68. 2 %, respectively. In the NSM, however, there were no differences between control and exercised animals concerning the total number of myelinated nerve fibers, the size of axons and myelin sheaths of nerve fibres and the degree of myelination of axons (myelin area divided by <b>axon</b> <b>area).</b> Comparison with other studies suggests that the intensity of exercise may be the critical parameter responsible for discrepancies in the literature.

50|$|The L1 {{family of}} {{proteins}} {{are involved in}} neuronal migration, {{as well as in}} axon growth and proper synapse formation, and include L1CAM, CHL1, NrCAM and neurofascin. L1-Cell Adhesion Molecule (L1CAM) was first discovered to be important in neuron-related tissue development in the mid-1980s, and is a trans-membranal glycoprotein of approximately 200-220 kDa. On its extracellular domain, the L1CAM protein includes IgG-like and fibronectin-III (FN-III) repeats which allow for interaction with integrins and ECM proteins. Similarly to integrin, F1CAM expresses domains intracellularly that interact with the actin cytoskeleton.

These differences range from morphologic characteristics of individual fibers {{to differences in}} macroscopic properties of collections of fibers. Our method uses statistical physics tools to improve on traditional measures, such as fiber size and packing density. As a case study, we analyze cross-sectional electron micrographs from the fornix of young and old rhesus monkeys using a semi-automatic detection algorithm to identify and characterize myelinated axons. We then apply a feature selection approach to identify the features that best distinguish between the young and old age groups, achieving a maximum accuracy of 94 % when assigning samples to their age groups. This analysis shows that the best discrimination is obtained using the combination of two features: the fraction of occupied <b>axon</b> <b>area</b> and the effective local density. The latter is a modified calculation of axon density, which reflects how closely axons are packed.

40|$|Purpose To {{compare the}} process of myelination in the {{developing}} optic nerve (ON) of anaemic rats with the subsequent recovery after being fed an iron-recovery diet. Methods In this study, the morphometrical parameters in the ON were assessed by electron microscopy in Wistar rats that were on an iron-deficient diet for 32 days or for 21 days followed by 10 days on an iron-recovery diet. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed using representative electron ultramicrographs. Data were analysed by {{one-way analysis of variance}} (ANOVA). When differences were detected, comparisons were made using Tukey`s post hoc test (P< 0. 05 was considered to be significant). Results Qualitative analysis of the ONs in anaemic and recovered animals showed a higher rate of deformed axons and increased lamellar separation in the myelin sheath when compared with the respective control group. The ON of the anaemic group showed a reduced mean density of myelinated fibres when compared with the control group. The fibre area ratio, <b>axon</b> <b>area</b> ratio, and myelin area ratio of large axons/small axons in the ONs of the control group showed the highest values for the myelin areas, axon areas, and total fibre areas. The control group showed a significantly higher myelin sheath thickness when compared with the anaemic and recovered groups. Conclusions Our data indicate that iron is necessary for maintenance of the ON cell structure, and that morphological damage from iron deficiency is not easily reverted by iron repletion.

40|$|AIMS/BACKGROUND [...] Visual {{symptoms}} {{are a common}} but not invariable feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and such symptoms appear to become more pronounced as {{the severity of the}} dementia increases. Pathology in both the pregeniculate and cortical parts of the visual system has been suggested to underlie the visual deficits in AD. In order to investigate the former possibility, the effect of AD on the optic nerve was investigated. METHODS [...] Intraorbital segments of optic nerve were taken at autopsy from nine patients with AD and seven patients with no history of psychiatric or neurological disease and no abnormal neuropathology. All patients had functional vision before death and appeared free of retinal, optic nerve, or microvascular disease. The optic nerves were processed into resin, semi-thin sections cut perpendicular to the long axis of each optic nerve, and stained with paraphenylenediamine. The sections were then investigated using an image analysis system and standard morphometric techniques. RESULTS [...] There {{was no significant difference in}} the mean cross sectional neural area of AD compared with control optic nerves. Neither were there any significant differences between myelinated axon surface density, total axon number, or mean cross sectional <b>axon</b> <b>area</b> in AD compared with control optic nerves. CONCLUSION [...] These results indicate that optic nerve degeneration is not a feature of AD and suggest that the visual deficits in the disease result from cortical dysfunction.

Objective: To compare the effects of different intensities of resistance training on radial nerve structures. Methods: Rats were divided into three groups: control (GC), training with 50 % (GF 1) and training 75 % (GF 2) of the animal’s body weight. The morphological analysis of the nerve was done by light and transmission electron microscopy. One-way ANOVA and the Tukey’s post hoc test were applied and the significance level was set at p≤ 0. 05. Results: Training groups had an increase of strength compared to GC (p≤ 0. 05). All measured nerve components (mean area and diameter of myelin fibers and <b>axons,</b> mean <b>area</b> and thickness of the myelin sheath, and of neurofilaments and microtubules) were higher in GF 2 {{compared to the other}} (p≤ 0. 05).

40|$|Multiple {{successive}} geometrical inhomogeneities, such as extensive arborization and terminal varicosities, are usual {{characteristics of}} axons. Near such regions {{the velocity of}} the action potential (AP) changes. This study uses AXONTREE, a modeling tool developed in the companion paper for two purposes: (a) to gain insights into the consequence of these irregularities for the propagation delay along axons, and (b) to simulate the propagation of APs along a reconstructed axon from a cortical cell, taking into account information concerning the distribution of boutons (release sites) along such axons to estimate the distribution of arrival times of APs to the axons release sites. We used Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) like membrane properties at 20 degrees C. Focusing on the propagation delay which results from geometrical changes along the axon (and not from the actual diameters or length of the axon), the main results are: (a) the propagation delay at a region of a single geometrical change (a step change in axon diameter or a branch point) is {{in the order of}} a few tenths of a millisecond. This delay critically depends on the kinetics and the density of the excitable channels; (b) as a general rule, the lag imposed on the AP propagation at a region with a geometrical ratio GR greater than 1 is larger than the lead obtained at a region with a reciprocal of that GR value; (c) when the electronic distance between two successive geometrical changes (Xdis) is small, the delay is not the sum of the individual delays at each geometrical change, when isolated. When both geometrical changes are with GR greater than 1 or both with GR less than 1, this delay is supralinear (larger than the sum of individual delays). The two other combinations yield a sublinear delay; and (d) in a varicose axon, where the diameter changes frequently from thin to thick and back to thin, the propagation velocity may be slower than the velocity along a uniform axon with the thin diameter. Finally, we computed propagation delays along a morphologically characterized axon from layer V of the somatosensory cortex of the cat. This axon projects mainly to area 4 but also sends collaterals to areas 3 b and 3 a. The model predicts that, for this <b>axon,</b> <b>areas</b> 3 a, 3 b, and the proximal part of area 4 are activated approximately 2 ms before the activation of the distal part of area 4...|$|R

Methods The posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) was biopsied in 25 diabetic and 19 non-diabetic patients undergoing carpal tunnel decompression for CTS. Detailed morphometric and immunohistological analyses were performed in the nerve biopsy. Results In diabetic patients median nerve distal motor latency was prolonged (p < 0. 05 vs non-diabetic patients), PIN myelinated fibre density (p < 0. 05), fibre area (p < 0. 0001) and <b>axon</b> <b>area</b> (p < 0. 0001) were reduced, the percentage of unassociated Schwann cell profiles (p < 0. 0001) and unmyelinated axon density (p < 0. 0001) were increased and the axon diameter was reduced (p < 0. 0001). Endoneurial capillary basement membrane area was increased (p < 0. 0001) in diabetic patients, but endothelial cell number was increased (p < 0. 01) and luminal area was reduced (p < 0. 05) in non-diabetic patients with CTS. There was no difference in the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha between diabetic and non-diabetic patients with CTS. However, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) (p < 0. 05) and its receptors VEGFR- 1 (p < 0. 01) and VEGFR- 2 (p < 0. 05) was significantly increased in diabetic patients, particularly those with type 1 diabetes, and related to the severity of nerve fibre pathology. Conclusions/interpretation This study demonstrates increased nerve fibre and microvascular pathology in relation to enhanced expression of VEGF and its receptors in a non-compressed nerve in diabetic compared with non-diabetic patients with CTS. It therefore provides a potential molecular and pathological basis for the predisposition of diabetic patients to the development of CTS...|$|E

This hydrogel has previously shown excellent anti-adhesive effects even after aggressive internal neurolysis in a rat model. Here, we confirmed {{the effects of the}} hydrogel on morphological and physiological recovery after nerve decompression. We prepared a rat model of chronic sciatic nerve compression using silicone tubing. Morphological and physiological recovery was confirmed at one, two, and three months after nerve decompression by assessing motor conduction velocity (MCV), the wet weight of the tibialis anterior muscle and morphometric evaluations of nerves. Electrophysiology showed significantly quicker recovery in the CMC-PE group than in the control group (24. 0 ± 3. 1 vs. 21. 0 ± 2. 1 m/s (p < 0. 05) at one months and MCV continued to be significantly faster thereafter. Wet muscle weight at one month significantly differed between the CMC-PE (BW) and control groups (0. 148 ± 0. 020 vs. 0. 108 ± 0. 019 %BW). The mean wet muscle weight was constantly higher in the CMC-PE group than in the control group throughout the experimental period. The <b>axon</b> <b>area</b> at one month was twice as large in the CMC-PE group compared with the control group (24. 1 ± 17. 3 vs. 12. 3 ± 9 μm 2) due to the higher ratio of axons with a larger diameter. Although the trend continued throughout the experimental period, the difference decreased after two months and was not statistically significant at three months. Although anti-adhesives can reduce adhesion after nerve injury, their effects on morphological and physiological recovery after surgical decompression of chronic entrapment neuropathy have not been investigated in detail. The present study showed that the new anti-adhesive CMC-PE gel can accelerate morphological and physiological recovery of nerves after decompression surgery...|$|E

In the present study, we utilized sem mice and wild-type littermates (wt mice) to investigate the physiological role of p 38 α in nerve regeneration following crush injuries. Results At four weeks after crush injury, the average axon diameter and the average <b>axon</b> <b>area</b> in sem mice were significantly smaller than those in wt mice. The average myelin sheath thickness in sem mice was reduced compared to wt mice, but no significant difference was observed in the G-ratio between the two groups. The sciatic functional index value demonstrated that functional nerve recovery in sem mice following crush injury was delayed, which is consistent with the histological findings. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of these findings, we examined inflammatory responses of the sciatic nerve by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. At an early phase following crush injury, sem mice showed remarkably lower expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL- 1 β, than wt mice. The expression of Caspase- 3 and Tenascin-C were also lower in sem mice. Conversely, at a late phase of the response, sem mice showed considerably higher expression of TNF-α and of IL- 1 β with lower expression of S- 100 than wt mice. Conclusions This is the first study of the physiological role of p 38 MAPK in nerve regeneration that does not rely on the use of pharmacological inhibitors. Our results indicate that p 38 α insufficiency may cause an inflammatory disorder, resulting in a delay of histological and functional nerve recovery following crush injury. We conclude that p 38 MAPK has an important physiological role in nerve regeneration and may be important for controlling both initiation of inflammation and recovery from nerve injury. </p...|$|E
50|$|Unless {{the immune}} system is compromised, it {{suppresses}} reactivation of the virus and prevents shingles outbreaks. Why this suppression sometimes fails is poorly understood, but shingles {{is more likely to}} occur in people whose immune systems are impaired due to aging, immunosuppressive therapy, psychological stress, or other factors. Upon reactivation, the virus replicates in neuronal cell bodies, and virions are shed from the cells and carried down the <b>axons</b> to the <b>area</b> of skin innervated by that ganglion. In the skin, the virus causes local inflammation and blistering. The short- and long-term pain caused by shingles outbreaks originates from inflammation of affected nerves due to the widespread growth of the virus in those areas.|$|R
40|$|In primates, {{different}} cortical <b>areas</b> send <b>axons</b> {{of different}} diameters into comparable tracts, notably the corpus callosum (Tomasi S, Caminiti R, Innocenti GM. 2012. Areal differences {{in diameter and}} length of corticofugal projections. Cereb Cortex. 22 : 1463 - 1472). We now explored if an <b>area</b> also sends <b>axons</b> of different diameters to different targets. We find that the parietal area PEc sends thicker <b>axons</b> to <b>area</b> 4 and 6, and thinner ones to the cingulate region (area 24). Areas 4 and 9, each sends axons of different diameters to the nucleus caudatus, to different levels of the internal capsule, and to the thalamus. The internal capsule receives the thickest axon, followed by thalamus and nucleus caudatus. The 2 areas (4 and 9) differ in the diameter and length of axons to corresponding targets. We calculated how diameter determines conduction velocity of the axons and together with pathway length determines transmission delays between different brain sites. We propose that projections from and within the cerebral cortex consist of a complex system of lines of communication with different geometrical and time computing properties. © The Author 2013...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{signaling}} {{of cardiac}} autonomic innervation is an unresolved issue. Here, {{we show that}} glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) promotes cardiac sympathetic innervation in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, ventricular myocytes (VMs) and sympathetic neurons (SNs) isolated from neonatal rat ventricles and superior cervical ganglia were cultured at a close distance. Then, morphological and functional coupling between SNs and VMs was assessed in response to GDNF (10 ng/ml) or nerve growth factor (50 ng/ml).

40|$|During {{peripheral}} {{nervous system}} development, successful communication between axons and glial cells including Schwann cells in {{peripheral nervous system}} and oligodendrocytes in central nervous system, {{is required for the}} proper functions of both neurons and glia. Three types of alternatively-spliced proteins belonging to the neuregulin 1 (NRG 1) gene family of growth and differentiation factors are essential for Schwann cell survival and peripheral nerve development. While membrane-bound NRG 1 forms (type III) has been strongly implicated in the regulation of myelination process at late stage of Schwann cell development, {{little is known about the}} role of soluble, heparin-binding forms of NRG 1 (type I/II) in regulating early Schwann cell development in vivo. These forms are rapidly released from axons in vitro by Schwann cell-secreted neurotrophic factors, and, unlike membrane-bound forms, have a unique ability to diffuse and adhere to heparan sulfate-rich cell surfaces. We harness this natural targeting ability of soluble NRG 1 to develop a novel antagonist by fusing its heparing-binding domain (HBD) to the soluble human epidermal growth factor receptor 4 (HER 4). This fusion protein retains high affinity for heparin binding and to specific cell surface that express heparan sulfates resulting in a much more potent NRG 1 antagonist than any other inhibitors for this molecule. In vivo, it is targeted to peripheral nerve segments where endogenous soluble NRG 1 binds to and efficiently blocks the activity of NRG 1 as a Schwann cell survival factor, leading to significant cell apoptosis in both motor and sensory <b>axon</b> <b>area</b> dose-dependently. In this thesis work, we also show that axon-derived soluble NRG 1 translocates from axonal to Schwann cell surfaces in the embryonic chick between days 5 - 7, corresponding to the critical period of Schwann cell survival during the normal development of peripheral nervous system. Down-regulating endogenous soluble NRG 1 signaling with the targeted antagonist or shRNA via chick in ovo electroporation, blocks their differentiation from precursors into immature Schwann cells and increases programmed cell death, while up-regulating NRG 1 rescues Schwann cells from normal-occurring apoptosis. Furthermore, exogenous BDNF also promotes Schwann cell survival through promoting the local release of axonal NRG 1 by binding axonal trkB or p 75 receptor. Consistently, increased Schwann cell death occurs both in trkB knock-out mice and after knocking-down axonal trkB in chick embryos, which can then be rescued with soluble NRG 1. These findings suggest a localized, axoglial feedback loop through soluble NRG 1 and BDNF critical for early Schwann cell survival and differentiation in vivo, which may not only be important for the axoglial communication, but may also be helpful in understanding nervous system diseases that involve the axoglial interface and the providing better therapeutic strategies for their treatments...|$|E
40|$|Neuronal {{connections}} are arranged topographically {{such that the}} spatial organization of neurons is preserved by their termini in the targets. During the development of topographic projections, <b>axons</b> initially explore <b>areas</b> much wider than the final targets, and mistargeted axons are pruned later. The molecules regulating these processes are not known. We report here that the ligands of the Eph family tyrosine kinase receptors may regulate both the initial outgrowth and the subsequent pruning of axons. In the presence of ephrins, the outgrowth and branching of the receptor-positive hippocampal axons are enhanced. However, these axons are induced later to degenerate. These observations suggest that the ephrins and their receptors may regulate topographic map formation by stimulating axonal arborization and by pruning mistargeted axons...|$|R
40|$|Structure and {{function}} of peripheral nerve in early insulin deficient streptozotocin diabetic rat were examined. Quantitative studies of myelinated fibres from electron micrographs showed that the fibre calibre and slope coefficients of regression lines between <b>axon</b> and myelin <b>areas</b> were reduced and quantitation of unmyelinated fibres revealed a 40 % reduction in area fraction of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The difference in conduction velocity between diabetic rats and control rats increased with time just as does the difference in fibre calibre. Insulin treatment was able to prevent the decrease in conduction velocity {{as well as the}} reduction in fibre calibre. It is concluded that the early structural axon abnormalities results from the diabetic state and cannot be explained by poor general condition of the animals...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} importance of neural activity versus activity-independent cues in shaping the initial wiring of the brain is still largely an open question. While activity is clearly critical for circuit rearrangements after initial connections have been made, whether it also {{plays a role in}} initial axon pathfinding remains to be determined. Here, we investigated this question using the guidance of zebrafish retinal ganglion cell axons to their targets in the tectum as a model. Recent results have implicated biased branching as a key feature of pathfinding in the zebrafish tectum. Using tetrodotoxin to silence neural activity globally, we found a decrease in the <b>area</b> covered by <b>axon</b> branches during pathfinding. After reaching the target, there were dynamic differences in <b>axon</b> length, <b>area</b> and the number of branches between conditions. However, other aspects of pathfinding were unaffected by silencing, including the ratio of branches directed toward the target, length, and number of branches, as well as turning angle, velocity, and number of growth cones per axon. These results challenge the hypothesis that neural connections develop in sequential stages of molecularly guided pathfinding and activity-based refinement. Despite a maintenance of overall guidance, axon pathfinding dynamics can nevertheless be altered by activity loss. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Develop Neurobiol 75 : 608 - 620, 201...|$|R
40|$|One {{important}} therapeutic goal during CNS injury from trauma or demyelinating {{diseases such}} as multiple sclerosis is to develop methods to promote remyelination.

In PBStreated SJL/J mice, the number of remyelinating axons per square millimeter of lesion area increased significantly 3 and 5 weeks after lysolecithin injection in the spinal cord. However, methylprednisolone or a monoclonal antibody (mAb), SCH 94. 03, developed {{for its ability to}} promote remyelination in the Theiler’s virus murine model of demyelination, further increased the number of remyelinating <b>axons</b> per lesion <b>area</b> at 3 weeks by a factor of 2. 6 and 1. 9, respectively, but did not increase the ratio of myelin sheath thickness to axon diamete...|$|R
