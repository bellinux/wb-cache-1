Together with various stakeholders and the community, a vision for the intensification of Eglinton Avenue was developed. The study resulted in a Plan with 21 recommendations, which were adopted by City Council in May 2014, along with direction to consult further on initial <b>implementation</b> <b>measures.</b> The purpose of this report is to recommend the adoption of some initial <b>implementation</b> <b>measures</b> for the 21 study recommendations endorsed by Council, and to report back on the results of three community meetings held in May 2014.

25|$|The European Union {{operates}} {{according to}} the principles of conferral (which says that it should act only within the limits of the competences conferred on it by the treaties) and of subsidiarity (which says that it should act only where an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states acting alone). Laws made by the EU institutions are passed in a variety of forms. Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national <b>implementation</b> <b>measures</b> (regulations) and those which specifically require national <b>implementation</b> <b>measures</b> (directives).|$|R

40|$|Treatment {{implementation}} is an under-studied and under-reported {{aspect of}} intervention studies involving individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). One primary {{area of concern}} {{is the lack of}} reliable and valid <b>implementation</b> <b>measures,</b> which allows a conclusive association to be drawn between the intervention and participant outcomes. This study examined the psychometric properties of two <b>implementation</b> <b>measures</b> developed for comprehensive treatment models serving preschoolers with ASD (i. e., LEAP and TEACCH). Both of the measures were completed in classrooms using LEAP or TEACCH instructional approaches as well as in classrooms in which a business-as-usual or non-model specific treatment approach was used. Across four months of one school year, a maximum of 4 observations were conducted in each of the 34 classrooms involved in the study. Results indicated that both implementation tools are reliable and valid, and that particular subscales of these measures allowed for discrimination of the three types of classrooms from each other. This step of psychometrically validating <b>implementation</b> <b>measures</b> as part of conducting efficacy studies may yield more robust associations between implementation and intervention effects. Research highlights: ► Treatment implementation is an under-studied and under-reported aspect of intervention studies involving individuals with autism spectrum disorder. ► This study examined the psychometric properties of two <b>implementation</b> <b>measures</b> developed for comprehensive treatment models serving preschoolers with ASD (i. e., LEAP and TEACCH). ► Results indicated that both implementation tools are reliable and valid, and that particular subscales of these measures allowed for discrimination of the three types of classrooms from each other...|$|R

40|$|Research on member states’ {{compliance}} with European Union legislation often {{focuses on the}} timing of self-reported <b>implementation</b> <b>measures.</b> It is generally assumed that the earlier a member state adopts an <b>implementation</b> <b>measure</b> the more compliant it is. This is problematic because early measures may only partially address the goals of a European Union directive. We study whether and when reporting national legislation to signal directive implementation is associated with detected non-compliance by the European Commission. We find that unless facing strong reputational costs, member states often do report pre-existing measures of low fit to a given directive without making timely adjustments. Indicating compliance problems, this generally leads to the European Commission opening infringement cases...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{municipal}} ordinances regarding Satochi landscapes conservation {{have been}} frequently enacted, and expectations for these ordinances have been increasing. Improvement {{of the implementation}} of these municipal ordinances {{can be regarded as}} urgent and important. As a first step toward improvement, this paper attempts to give a detailed picture of these ordinances at regional scale by classification based on the contents of the documents of in these ordinances. As a result, three different types were distinguished. The first type consisted of ordinances enacted recently, in which a target site with farmland and forest and the community participation system as <b>implementation</b> <b>measure</b> were described (Type A). It was considered that this type of ordinance responded to the problems on conserving farmland and forest integrally. The second type consisted of ordinances in which government-initiated <b>implementation</b> <b>measures</b> regarding the maintenance of forests or agricultural lands were described (Type B). The third type consisted of ordinances without a definite description of the target site and <b>implementation</b> <b>measures</b> (Type C). It was also suggested that ordinances of Type A and Type B had different institutional issues. It was considered that Type A and Type B contributed to different aspect of Satochi landscape conservation and that a resolution of issues of each type was needed...|$|R
