5|$|After the {{successful}} {{assault on the}} northern wall, the defenders fled to the Temple Mount, pursued by Tancred and his men. Arriving before the defenders could secure the area, Tancred's men assaulted the precinct, butchering many of the defenders, with the remainder taking refuge in the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Tancred then called <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> slaughter, offering those in the mosque his protection. When the defenders on the southern wall heard {{of the fall of}} the northern wall, they fled to the citadel, allowing Raymond and the Provençals to enter the city. Iftikhar al-Dawla, the commander of the garrison, struck a deal with Raymond, surrendering the citadel in return for being granted safe passage to Ascalon.|$|E
5|$|Even though Vrbanac ordered <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{operation}} {{shortly after}} midnight on 18/19 September, the Bjelovar Corps failed to cancel new crossing attempts it had ordered for 6:00 the following morning. The attacks went ahead, albeit at 10:30, with the 52nd and the 125th Home Guard regiments' battlegroups {{trying to cross}} the Sava River at different locations. Despite strengthening river currents and continued VRS artillery fire, small reconnaissance elements managed to cross the river, only to be forced back an hour later.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of several Spec Ops games in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the series met with low sales and poor reviews, causing <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{production}} of successive games. In 2003, Take-Two mentioned in their financial results that Rockstar Games {{was working on the}} franchise, but in 2004 the project was cancelled. It was later revealed that Rockstar Vancouver would have developed the canned project, with Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme working on the soundtrack for the game.|$|E

2500|$|The {{price of}} {{collectivization}} {{was so high}} that the March 2, 1930 issue of Pravda contained Stalin's article , in which he called for <b>a</b> temporary <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> process: ...|$|R
25|$|In March 2011, around 2,000 anti-nuclear protesters {{demonstrated}} in Taiwan for <b>an</b> immediate <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{construction of the}} island's fourth nuclear power plant.

5|$|However, {{with the}} {{creation}} of the newly established First Republic of Armenia in 1918, Bagramyan enlisted in the 3rd Armenian Regiment of that country's armed forces. From 1 April 1918, that is, after the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (March 3, 1918) with the Russian SFSR, he was in the 1st Armenian Cavalry Regiment, which put <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman 3rd Army, which was bent on conquering the remains of the republic, in Karaurgan, Sarikamish and Kars. He most notably took part in the May 1918 Battle of Sardarapat, where the Armenian military scored a crucial victory against Turkish forces. He remained in the regiment until May 1920.|$|E
5|$|As summer approached, Đujić's Chetniks {{captured}} Drvar {{from the}} Ustaše. By early summer, he and Chetnik commander Stevo Rađenović had contacted the Italians {{and asked them}} to put <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ustaše mistreatment of Serbs, enable the return of Serb refugees, and repeal a decree that enabled the confiscation of Serb-owned property in the NDH. The Italians obliged in the hope that doing so would win the Chetniks over to collaboration and seriously weaken any future uprising in the area, which would have further disrupted rail traffic along the Split–Karlovac line. On 13 August, at a meeting in the village of Pađene, Đujić and several other Serb nationalists agreed to collaborate with the Italians. They secretly signed a pact of non-aggression with the Italian military, and in exchange, the Italians acquiesced to Đujić's 3,000 Chetniks operating in and around Knin. On 31 August, at a Drvar assembly, Đujić was given the task of stopping the Italian advance on the town. Immediately afterwards, he made an agreement with the Italians granting them free passage.|$|E
5|$|As the Doctor and {{geologist}} Nasreen Chaudhry arrive by TARDIS in {{the massive}} Silurian underground civilisation, they are captured and taken to the Silurian doctor, Malohkeh. The Silurians' hostility is increased when the Doctor recalls his previous meeting with a similar race of reptilian humanoids which were destroyed by humans, {{a reference to the}} Third Doctor in Doctor Who and the Silurians. Meanwhile, Amy and Mo escape from Malokeh's experimentation and Mo discovers his son, Elliot, sedated in a chamber and under observation. When Malokeh realises the Doctor is not human, the leader of the Silurian warrior caste, Restac, insists both the Doctor and Nasreen be executed and escorts them to a Silurian court; though Amy and Mo interrupt the trial with stolen weapons, they too are captured. Eldane, Restac's superior, is called in by Malohkeh and demands <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hostilities.|$|E

25|$|A {{total of}} several hundred {{thousand}} people were involved in this Great Economic Emigration which grew steadily more intense until {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in 1914.

50|$|Demands of her {{own career}} brought <b>a</b> {{temporary}} <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Studio Galerie which was relaunched in 2009 {{and focused on the}} concept of contemporary international artists from Germany and Japan: Christian Heß, Takao Inoue, Herbert Klee, Albert Lohr, Akashi Murakami, Christine Ott, Angelika Sieger, Georg Thumbach and others.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Zvi Aharoni, {{one of the}} Mossad {{agents who}} had been {{involved}} in the Eichmann capture, was placed in charge of a team of agents tasked with locating Mengele and bringing him to trial in Israel. Inquiries in Paraguay gave no clues as to his whereabouts, and they were unable to intercept any correspondence between Mengele and his wife Martha, then living in Italy. Agents following Rudel's movements did not produce any leads. Aharoni and his team followed Gerhard to a rural area near São Paulo, where they located a European man believed to be Mengele. Aharoni reported his findings to Harel, but the logistics of staging a capture, budgetary constraints, and the need to focus on the nation's deteriorating relationship with Egypt led the Mossad chief to call <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> operation in 1962.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{government}} began {{negotiations with the}} Allies about the terms of surrender on 10August. During this period B-29 attacks on Japan were limited to a raid by the 315thBombardment Wing against an oil target {{on the night of}} 9/10August and a daytime precision bombing attack on a factory in Tokyo on 10August. The next day, President Truman ordered <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bombing due to the possibility that it would be interpreted as a sign that the peace negotiations had failed. On 11August, Spaatz issued a new targeting directive for any renewed attacks that reduced the emphasis on bombing cities in favor of intensified attacks on transport infrastructure. On 13August, B-29s dropped copies of the Japanese government's conditional offer to surrender over Japanese cities. Negotiations appeared to be stalled, and on 14August Spaatz received orders to resume the bombing campaign. Arnold requested the largest attack possible, and hoped that USASTAF could dispatch 1,000 aircraft against the Tokyo region and other locations in Japan. In fact, 828 B-29s escorted by 186 fighters (for a total of 1,014 aircraft) were dispatched; during the day precision raids were made against targets at Iwakuni, Osaka and Tokoyama and at night the cities of Kumagaya and Isesaki were firebombed. While the Eighth Air Force units at Okinawa had not yet conducted any missions against Japan, General Doolittle decided not to contribute aircraft to this operation as {{he did not want to}} risk the lives of the men under his command when the war was effectively over. These were the last attacks conducted against Japan by heavy bombers, as at noon on 15August Hirohito made a radio broadcast announcing his country's intention to surrender.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{found time}} in mid-2000 {{to help put}} {{together}} a final and definitive version of the film with restoration producer Charles de Lauzirika, which was only partially completed in mid-2001 before legal and financial issues forced <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> work.|$|E

50|$|According to {{a number}} of {{scholars}} and preachers, the concepts of liberalism and democratic participation were already present in the medieval Islamic world.

25|$|During {{his tenure}} {{as head of the}} Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel in 2003–2004, Jack Goldsmith put <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> use of {{waterboarding}} as an interrogation technique because of serious concern over its legality, but Goldsmith's order was quickly reversed by others within the George W. Bush administration.|$|E
25|$|Before Batu's {{forces could}} {{continue}} into Vienna and northern Albania, news of Ögedei's death in December 1241 brought <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> invasion. As was customary in Mongol military tradition, all princes of Genghis's line had {{to attend the}} kurultai to elect a successor. Batu and his western Mongol army withdrew from Central Europe the next year.|$|E
25|$|By 11 August, the Mortain counter-offensive had {{ground to}} <b>a</b> <b>halt.</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> east, US forces took Argentan on 13 August while British and Canadian forces closed in toward Falaise from the north, thus {{initiating}} {{the drive to}} encircle and destroy two German armies inside the Falaise Pocket. As the siege of the Breton ports continued, {{the focus of the}} war was quickly shifting further east.|$|E
50|$|Her {{reporting}} brought Richard Moose and James Lowenstein, Indochina investigators for the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to Phnom Penh. When U.S. Embassy {{officials told}} them that Foa’s stories were ridiculous, they went to her office <b>to</b> ask about <b>the</b> source of her reports. There they listened on Foa’s transistor radio to embassy officials directing the bombing by American warplanes. The Senate ordered <b>an</b> immediate <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bombing of Cambodia.|$|R
5|$|By August 3, Colonel Warren {{concluded}} the entire effort was futile and dangerous. The unprotected sailors were stirring up radioactive material and contaminating their skin, clothing, and, presumably, their lungs. When {{they returned to}} their support ship living quarters, they contaminated the shower stalls, laundry facilities, and everything they touched. Warren demanded <b>an</b> immediate <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entire cleanup operation. He was especially concerned about plutonium, which was undetectable on site.|$|R
50|$|In 1906 Taylor began <b>a</b> {{campaign}} <b>to</b> <b>halt</b> <b>the</b> Indo-Chinese opium trade, {{winning the}} support of the new Liberal government of Henry Campbell-Bannerman. The trade was finally ended in 1917.|$|R
25|$|But {{just six}} months later, the UMWA called <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> strike. The union had disbursed more than $1 million in strike relief funds, {{but it was no}} longer financially able to keep the strike going. On July 1, 1911, the UMWA {{executive}} board voted to end to the strike. Although most miners returned to work, about 400 were blacklisted and forced to seek employment outside Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|The Nachusa House {{was first}} {{conceived}} in 1837 by John Dixon, {{the founder of}} Dixon, Illinois, {{and a group of}} early settlers when they returned from a trip to the then-state capital of Vandalia. While in Vandalia the group had pushed the state legislature for a charter to establish the Dixon Hotel Company. Money was raised and a foundation laid in 1838 but the Panic of 1837 put <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> project.|$|E
25|$|With the {{construction}} of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway underway, the sternwheelers were needed to help deliver equipment and food supplies to the work camps. However, with the onset of World War I, John Stewart of Foley, Welch and Stewart called <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> PGE's construction. In 1915, the BX worked alone, with the BC Express reserved for special trips. Despite having a monopoly on river traffic, the BX finished the season with a $7000 loss.|$|E
50|$|Appointed {{minister}} without {{portfolio in}} the minority Country Party government of Sir Albert Dunstan in June 1936, Hyland was promoted to various ministries, both in minority Country Party and in coalition cabinets, until {{the election of the}} Cain government in 1952 brought <b>a</b> temporary <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> instability of Victorian politics. Hyland's portfolios included Transport (1938-43), Chief Secretary (1943-45), State Development (1947-48 and 1950-52), Labour (1947-48), Decentralisation (1948) and Transport and Prices (1950-52).|$|R
50|$|Grady Calkins was a Confederate {{veteran of}} the Great War, {{and member of the}} Birmingham, Alabama chapter of the Freedom Party. In 1922, he assassinated Confederate President Wade Hampton V. He was gunned down by the state militia after a brief shootout moments later. This act brought <b>a</b> {{temporary}} <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> momentum the Freedom Party had built up throughout the 1920s, leaving the party in the political wilderness until the Great Depression and the 1933 election.|$|R
50|$|Defense {{treaties}} with South Korea and the Republic of China (Formosa/Taiwan) were signed, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) alliance in <b>an</b> effort <b>to</b> <b>halt</b> <b>the</b> spread of Communism in Asia was formed.|$|R
25|$|When a {{misrepresentation}} {{has been}} made and an agreement was (or at any rate appeared to be) concluded, the misrepresentee {{does not have to}} bring <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deal. Misrepresentations generally do not render a contract void, as does the contractual doctrine of common mistake or frustration; it makes a contract voidable at the option of the misrepresentee. Not all contracts entered into on the strength of misrepresentations will be bad for the misrepresentee, who may choose not to void the contract.|$|E
25|$|The {{widespread}} support of action against communists and their associates began to abate somewhat after Senator Joseph McCarthy overreached {{himself in the}} Army-McCarthy Hearings, producing a backlash. The end of the Korean War in 1953 also led to a lessening of anxieties about subversion. The Supreme Court brought <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Smith Act prosecutions in 1957 in its decision in Yates v. United States, , which required that the government prove that the defendant had actually taken concrete steps toward the forcible overthrow of the government, rather than merely advocating it in theory.|$|E
25|$|Moncton grew rapidly {{during the}} early part of the 20th century, {{particularly}} after provincial lobbying saw the city become the eastern terminus of the massive National Transcontinental Railway project in 1912; this line would link Moncton with Edmundston, Quebec City, and on to Winnipeg where the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway continued to Saskatoon, Edmonton, and Prince Rupert. The First World War brought <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> era of railway expansion but the city would become an important trans-shipment point for materiel funnelling onwards to the port of Halifax.|$|E

25|$|The Islamic State's Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Massoud ordered <b>an</b> {{immediate}} <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crimes on {{the second}} day of the operation, but especially looting and the destruction of houses continued to take place for a second day.

However, this Shia officer Hussain Anwari himself became infamous for terrorizing both Pashtun civilians and depopulating Pashtun them, who were also raped and assaulted.|$|R
25|$|Randall Forsberg (née Watson, 1943–2007) became {{interested}} in arms control issues while working at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
