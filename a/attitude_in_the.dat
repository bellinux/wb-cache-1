5|$|In January, the Taça de Portugal {{started for}} Benfica; they {{entered in the}} fourth round and played with Oliveira do Bairro from the third tier. As Rui Costa {{recovered}} from various injuries, Santos implemented a diamond formation with Costa supporting two strikers. Benfica put five goals past Oliveira do Bairro and advanced to the fifth round. Santos attributed the win to his players' <b>attitude</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of an inferior opponent. Benfica's next match on 15 January was a visit to Estádio Cidade de Coimbra. Ricardo Rocha scored the opening goal for Benfica in the second minute and Léo scored the second in the 89th minute, ending the match 0–0 to Benfica. Santos called the match a great spectacle played at high-speed and where the win could have fallen for either side.|$|E

By 1805, when the last great French fleet to take to the sea was crushed at the Battle of Trafalgar, poor training and low investment in the Navy had reduced its efficiency to levels unthinkable 20years earlier.|$|E

A number of Hartman's lines exist where Jiji simply says nothing in the original. Jiji's personality is notably different between the two versions, showing a more cynical and sarcastic <b>attitude</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Disney English version as opposed to cautious and conscientious in the original Japanese.|$|E

25|$|With the {{widespread}} opposition among the Malays, the British administration entered into secret {{negotiations with the}} Malay aristocracy and the United Malay National Organisation (UMNO) as they were unwilling to allow the Malay opposition to the Union develop into an anti-British <b>attitude</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way that {{had happened in the}} Dutch East Indies where the locals were engaged in an open armed rebellion against the Dutch.

Once the subjects had done the tasks, the experimenters asked one group of subjects to speak with another subject (an actor), and persuade that impostor-subject that the tedious tasks were interesting and engaging. One group of subjects were paid twenty dollars ($20); a second group were paid one dollar ($1); and the control group were not asked {{to speak with the}} imposter-subject.|$|E
25|$|The {{instantaneous}} {{attitude of}} the vehicle was compared with the desired vehicle <b>attitude</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> LVDC. Attitude correction signals from the LVDC were converted into control commands by the flight control computer. The required thrust direction was obtained by gimbaling the engines in the propelling stage to change the thrust direction of the vehicle. Gimbaling of these engines was accomplished through hydraulic actuators. In {{the first and second}} stages (S-IC and S-II), the four outboard engines were gimbaled to control roll, pitch, and yaw. Since the third (S-IVB) stage has only one engine, an auxiliary propulsion system was used for roll control during powered flight. The auxiliary propulsion system provides complete attitude control during coast flight of the S-IUB/IU stage.|$|E

25|$|William {{considered}} his veteran army to be sufficient {{in size to}} defeat any forces (all rather inexperienced) that James could throw against him, {{but it had been}} decided to avoid the hazards of battle and maintain a defensive <b>attitude</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope James's position might collapse by itself. Thus he landed far away from James's army, expecting that his English allies would take the initiative in acting against James while he ensured his own protection against potential attacks. William was prepared to wait; he had paid his troops in advance for a three-month campaign. A slow advance, apart from being necessitated by heavy rainfall anyway, had the added benefit of not over-extending the supply lines; the Dutch troops were under strict orders not even to forage, for fear that this would degenerate into plundering, which would alienate the population.|$|E
25|$|On December 6, 1825, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives met {{to review}} the {{proposed}} charter. The charter was referred to the Committee on Education as Bill Number 12, who intensely debated the bill. After much deliberation, the bill {{was passed by the}} House one month later on January 6, 1826 with three provisions made that limited the power of the college, allowed those practicing any religion {{to be associated with the}} college, and allowed legislature to revoke the charter if deemed necessary. The bill was proposed to the Pennsylvania Senate on January 16, 1826 and again faced opposition. Some senators opposed the teaching of military science, believing it would inspire a war-like <b>attitude</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> students. After two months of discussion, the charter was approved by the Senate on March 7, 1829. Two days later, Governor of Pennsylvania J. Andrew Shulze approved the charter, and Lafayette College came into legal existence.|$|E

England changed their usually forward-dominated game plan and attempted to play more of a running game. It was unsuccessful and Australia battled out a 12–6 win. David Campese was named player of the tournament having scored six tries in a series of outstanding performances. Victory parades were held back in Australia for their national team.|$|E

25|$|Balkenende, a jurist by occupation, {{worked for}} the Dutch Academic Senate and the Christian Democratic Appeal think tank from 1982 until 1998. Balkenende became a {{professor}} of Christian theology at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in 1993. He {{was elected to the}} House of Representatives after the Dutch general election of 1998, serving from 19 May 1998 until 22 July 2002. After the then Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal and Parliamentary leader in the House of Representatives Jaap de Hoop Scheffer stepped down after an internal power struggle between him and then party chair Marnix van Rij, Balkenende was selected to succeed him in both positions, and became the Lijsttrekker (top candidate) for the Dutch general election of 2002. The Christian Democratic Appeal became the surprising winner of the election, gaining 14 seats becoming the largest party in the House of Representatives. This success was in part owed to Balkenende's neutral <b>attitude</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> debates with Pim Fortuyn, the eponymous leader of the Pim Fortuyn List party who was assassinated during the national election campaign on 6 May 2002.|$|E
25|$|Underwater trim is the diver's <b>attitude</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water, {{in terms}} of balance and {{alignment}} with the direction of motion. The free-swimming diver may need to trim erect or inverted at times, but in general, a horizontal trim has advantages both for reduction of drag when swimming horizontally, and for observing the bottom. A slightly head down horizontal trim allows the diver to direct propulsive thrust from the fins directly to the rear, which minimizes disturbance of sediments on the bottom, and {{reduces the risk of}} striking delicate benthic organisms with the fins. A stable horizontal trim requires that diver's centre of gravity is directly below the centre of buoyancy (the centroid). Small errors can be compensated fairly easily, but large offsets may make it necessary for the diver to constantly exert significant effort towards maintaining the desired attitude, if it is actually possible. The position of the centre of buoyancy is largely beyond the control of the diver, though the cylinder(s) may be shifted in the harness by a small amount, and the volume distribution of the buoyancy compensator has a large influence when inflated. Most of the control of trim available to the diver is in the positioning of ballast weights. Fine tuning of trim can be done by placing smaller weights {{along the length of the}} diver to bring the centre of gravity to the desired position.|$|E
