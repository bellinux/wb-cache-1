The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that works produced {{during this time}} were emphatically commercial, {{not paying attention to}} nationalistic or aesthetic values. However, the film scholars Thomas Barker and Charlotte Setijadi-Dunn suggest that the Chinese-produced films from the Indies offered the possibility of <b>a</b> <b>heterogeneous</b> national identity.|$|E

5|$|Native North Americans {{were among}} the first to {{influence}} fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials. Fire creates <b>a</b> <b>heterogeneous</b> ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment. Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species (e.g., Pinus halepensis) cannot germinate until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called serotiny. Fire plays a major role in the persistence and resilience of ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|The Persian {{infantry}} used in {{the invasion}} was probably <b>a</b> <b>heterogeneous</b> group drawn from across the empire. However, according to Herodotus, {{there was at least}} a general conformity in the type of armour and style of fighting. The troops were, generally speaking, armed with a bow, 'short spear' and sword, carried a wicker shield, and wore at most a leather jerkin. The one exception to this may have been the ethnic Persian troops, who may have worn a corslet of scale armour. Some contingents would have been armed somewhat differently; for instance, the Saka were renowned axemen. The 'elite' contingents of the Persian infantry seem to have been the ethnic Persians, Medians, Cissians and the Saka; Herodotus specifically mentions the presence of Persians and Saka at Marathon. The style of fighting used by the Persians was probably to stand off from an enemy, using their bows (or equivalent) to wear down the enemy before closing in to deliver the coup de grace with spear and sword.|$|E

Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries. Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa. More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and <b>a</b> <b>heterogeneous</b> salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.|$|E

40|$|International audienceImage {{databases}} represent {{increasingly important}} volume of information, {{so it is}} judicious to develop powerful systems to handle the images, index them, classify them to reach them quickly in these large image databases. In this paper, we propose <b>an</b> <b>heterogeneous</b> image retrieval system based on feature extraction and Support vector machines (SVM) classifier. For <b>an</b> <b>heterogeneous</b> image database, first of all we extract several feature kinds such as color descriptor, shape descriptor, and texture descriptor. Afterwards we improve the description of these features, by some original methods. Finally we apply an SVM classifier to classify the consequent index database. For evaluation purposes, using precision/recall curves on <b>an</b> <b>heterogeneous</b> image database, we looked for {{a comparison of the}} proposed image retrieval system with an other Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) which is QUadtree-based Index for image retrieval and Pattern search (QUIP-tree).
