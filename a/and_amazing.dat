5|$|Although The Thrill Book {{has been}} {{described}} as the first American pulp to specialize in fantasy and science fiction, this description is not supported by recent historians of the field, who regard it instead as a stepping stone on the path that ultimately led to Weird Tales <b>and</b> <b>Amazing</b> Stories, the first true specialized magazines in the fields of weird fiction and science fiction respectively.|$|E
5|$|In November 1999, Wizards {{announced}} that Gen Con would leave Milwaukee after the 2002 convention. Hasbro sold Origins to GAMA, and in May 2002 sold Gen Con to Peter Adkison. Wizards also outsourced its magazines by licensing Dungeon, Dragon, Polyhedron, <b>and</b> <b>Amazing</b> Stories to Paizo Publishing. Wizards released the Dungeons & Dragons miniatures collectible pre-painted plastic miniatures games in 2003, {{and added a}} licensed Star Wars line in 2004, and through its Avalon Hill brand an Axis & Allies World War II miniatures game in 2005. Wizards of the Coast's book publishing division has produced hundreds of titles that have sold millions of copies in over 16 languages.|$|E
5|$|When White {{took over}} as editor, Amazings {{circulation}} was about 38,500, only about 4% of which were subscribers (as opposed to newsstand sales). This was a very low ebb for subscriptions; Analog, by comparison, sold about 35% of its circulation through subscriptions. Cohen's wife mailed out the subscription copies from home, and Cohen had never tried to increase the subscriber base as this would have increased the burden on his wife. White worked hard to increase the circulation despite Cohen's lack of support, but met with limited success. One of his first changes was to reduce the typeface {{to increase the amount}} of fiction in the magazine. To pay for this he increased the price of both Fantastic <b>and</b> <b>Amazing</b> to 60 cents, but this had a strong negative effect on circulation, which fell about 10% from 1969 to 1970.|$|E

5|$|Newly united {{as a team}} in ROH, the Briscoes began, in 2003, to {{feud with}} A.J. Styles <b>and</b> <b>Amazing</b> Red, then holders of the ROH Tag Team Championship, losing in title matches at Night of Champions, The Epic Encounter, and Death Before Dishonor, which by {{stipulation}} was their last match for the title {{for as long as}} Styles and Red held it. Before the last match, a poll was held on ROH's website, asking the fans if they wanted to see a third match between the two teams. Over 80% of respondents voted 'yes'. At Beating the Odds, they returned from a brief absence to score a pair of wins which were depicted in the storyline as being improbable, Mark over ROH veteran B.J. Whitmer and Jay in a Four Corner Survival match with ROH World Champion Samoa Joe, NWA World Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles, and Chris Sabin, pinning Sabin to earn a future title shot at Joe. At ROH's Maryland debut, Tradition Continues, Joe retained over Jay.|$|E

25|$|Western {{designers}} {{often feel}} the need to tinker with the proa. They are attracted by the minimalist nature <b>and</b> <b>amazing</b> speeds that proas are capable of (they may still be the fastest sailboats per dollar spent for the home builder) but they often want the proa to do more; adding cabins, different sailing rigs, and bidirectional rudders are common changes made. James Wharram was greatly influenced by the Proa design.|$|E

25|$|On September 21, 2002, Morgan and Christopher Daniels, known {{collectively as}} The Prophecy, won a tournament to crown {{the first ever}} ROH Tag Team Champions, {{defeating}} Modest and his partner, The American Dragon. They held the titles until March 15, 2003, when they were defeated by A.J. Styles <b>and</b> <b>Amazing</b> Red. Morgan and Modest left ROH soon after following disputes over accommodation and schedule clashes with their Japanese commitments.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{paperback}} houses {{that contributed to}} the decline of the genre–Ace, Dell, Avon, among others–were actually started by pulp magazine publishers. They had the presses, the expertise, and the newsstand distribution networks which made the success of the mass-market paperback possible. These pulp-oriented paperback houses mined the old magazines for reprints. This kept pulp literature, if not pulp magazines, alive. The Return of the Continental Op reprints material first published in Black Mask; Five Sinister Characters contains stories first published in Dime Detective; and The Pocket Book of Science Fiction collects material from Thrilling Wonder Stories, Astounding Science Fiction <b>and</b> <b>Amazing</b> Stories. But note that mass market paperbacks are not pulps.|$|E
25|$|Zambia's {{wildlife}} management {{is considered one}} of best managed and administered among all countries in Africa. The management faces ever increasing challenges from a rapidly increasing humn population in the country. This manifest in the form of increasing poaching and illegal harvesting from national parks, encroachment, and deforestation due to charcoal production and farming activities. During the 1980s, the Zambian administration faced a shortage of trained staff, transport and patrols, leading the government to seek the support of NGOs and private bodies. After visiting the neglected and completely undeveloped Kasanka National Park {{for the first time in}} 1985 and hearing gunshots, the late David Lloyd, a British colonial officer, impressed with the wide range of habitats <b>and</b> <b>amazing</b> scenery, concluded that if there was still poaching, there must still be wildlife. He made it his life's mission to develop the park and safeguard the biodiversity of Kasanka.|$|E

25|$|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind was {{initially}} translated into English by Toren Smith and Dana Lewis. Smith, {{who had written}} comics in the U.S. since 1982, wrote an article on Warriors of the Wind (the heavily edited version of the film adaptation released in the U.S. in the 1980s) for the Japanese edition of Starlog, in which he criticized what New World Pictures had done to Miyazaki's film. The article {{came to the attention}} of Miyazaki himself, who invited Smith to Studio Ghibli for a meeting. On Miyazaki's insistence, Smith's own company Studio Proteus was chosen as the producer of the English-language translation. Smith hired Dana Lewis to collaborate on the translation. Lewis was a professional translator in Japan who also wrote for Newsweek and had written cover stories for such science fiction magazines as Analog Science Fiction and Fact <b>and</b> <b>Amazing</b> Stories. Smith hired Tom Orzechowski for the lettering and retouching.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to build a strong women's division, Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW) opened 2009 with January's Female Revolution. Under her Cheerleader gimmick, she beat Nikki Roxx and later {{appeared}} as Raisha Saeed also winning against Ariel. She appeared again in May losing a return match to Roxx but staying undefeated as Saeed against Daizee Haze. She was scheduled for a rematch with Roxx on November 16 but after Roxx pulled out she defeated Hailey Hatred to earn a match against Sara Del Rey for the JAPW Women's Championship. Anderson won the match by disqualification after Hatred interfered, leading to a no-disqualification Three Way match in January 2010 at Back Where It All Began for the title in which Anderson was pinned by Del Rey. Anderson met Del Rey later in 2010, on July 25, {{under the guise of}} her Raisha Saeed gimmick. It was during her Chikara debut in a tag team match, where she <b>and</b> <b>Amazing</b> Kong were defeated by Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (Haze and Del Rey).|$|E
25|$|Although Black {{was mostly}} {{successful}} in America, {{months prior to}} her final SHIMMER appearance she lost her RQW Women's Championship at a 16 June RQW event to German wrestler Wesna, with Jetta <b>and</b> <b>Amazing</b> Kong also competing in the four way elimination match. Her rematch with Wesna, this time in a singles match, took place at ChickFight IX.5 but ended in a controversial manner when Jetta interfered in the match {{to make it seem}} as if Black had used a foreign object, thus having her disqualified. Enraged, Black chased Jetta out of the building but the two were booked for a grudge match later on that same night; Giving Jetta a taste of her own medicine, Black attacked her from behind during her entrance leading to a brawl all around ringside that consumed most of the match until it officially began inside the ring with Black eventually losing as Jetta used the ropes for the pin. After Black was on the winning side of the tag team match at Shimmer, it became clear the two needed to settle their feud one-on-one and RQW decided to host the match in October. However, the hotly anticipated bout ended in a double count-out ostensibly due to the fierce fighting between the two, though Black had actually suffered a legitimate shoulder injury during the match and could not carry on.|$|E

25|$|Spider-Man {{finds the}} next {{fragment}} in a construction yard, discovering it was accidentally stuck to Juggernaut when {{on the run}} from Silver Sable and the Wild Pack. Juggernaut uses the tablet's power to become stronger, but Amazing Spider-Man defeats him and claims the fragment. In the Noir universe, The Goblin uses a fragment to become a monstrous goliath. After a battle under a circus tent, Goblin is defeated and Spider-Man Noir claims his fragment. Spider-Man 2099 encounters Doctor Octopus, head of Alchemax's Shadow Division, and the one who hired Scorpion. Driven insane by the fragment, she plans to use it to power a dangerous reactor. Spider-Man 2099 shuts down the reactor and claims the fragment. In the Ultimate universe, S.H.I.E.L.D. has acquired a tablet fragment and Carnage in the Triskelion. Carnage escapes, draining the life from the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and using the fragment's power to turn them into his zombie minions. When Ultimate Spider-Man arrives, the Triskelion is already under Carnage's control. Ultimate Spider-Man stops Carnage and claims his fragment. With the pieces returned, the tablet reconstructs itself and is absorbed by Mysterio, who becomes all-powerful and shatters the borders between realities, planning to build a new one under his rule. The four Spider-Men band together and defeat Mysterio, separating him from the tablet and knocking him out. As reality returns to normal, Madame Web thanks them for saving all of reality, <b>and</b> <b>Amazing</b> Spider-Man takes Mysterio to prison while the others return to their own dimensions.|$|E
