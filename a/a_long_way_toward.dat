40|$|There {{is a rich}} {{scholarly}} {{literature on}} sovereign default on external debt. Comparatively {{little is known about}} sovereign defaults on domestic debt. Even today, cross-country data on domestic public debt remains curiously exotic, particularly prior to the 1980 s. We have filled this gap in the literature by compiling a database on central government public debt (external and domestic). The data span 1914 to 2007 for most countries, reaching back into the nineteenth century for many. Our findings on debt sustainability, sovereign defaults, the temptation to inflate, and the hierarchy of creditors only scratch the surface of what the domestic public debt data can reveal. First, domestic debt is big [...] for the 64 countries for which we have long time series, domestic debt accounts for almost two-thirds of total public debt. For most of the sample, this debt carries a market interest rate (except for the financial repression era between WWII and financial liberalization). Second, the data go <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>ways</b> <b>toward</b> explaining the puzzle of why countries so often default on their external debts at seemingly low debt thresholds. Third, domestic debt has largely been ignored in the vast empirical work on inflation. In fact, domestic debt (a significant portion of which is long term and non-indexed) is often much larger than the monetary base in the run-up to high inflation episodes. Last, the widely-held view that domestic residents are strictly junior to external creditors does not find broad support. ...|$|R

500|$|Named a [...] "sensation", [...] "phenomenon", {{or other}} hyped up words {{in his first}} two years in the league, most of Clyde's {{troubles}} were attributed to the rush to get him into the majors before he was ready. This was due to the fact the Rangers finances were weak at the time. The Rangers averaged a near-capacity crowd in Clyde's six home starts, but 6,000 fans for the other 75 home dates. Prior to Clyde's debut, the highest crowd in Rangers history was 24,000. At the end of the 1973 season, Clyde drew nearly a third of all fans in attendance for Rangers home games throughout the year. According to journalist Randy Galloway, Clyde put baseball on the map in Dallas, as the city started to get interested on the sport, even after Clyde's inconsistency forced him out of the league. Longtime Rangers coach Jackie Moore agreed with Galloway, stating that Clyde and Corbett buying the team [...] "went <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> saving the franchise". Using Clyde success of bringing attendance up as an example, Short sold the Rangers to Brad Corbett in 1974, which prevented the American League from taking over the team, thus potentially saving the franchise.|$|E

60|$|Private Grayrock did not sleep; to {{have done}} so would have imperiled the {{interests}} of the United States, for he was <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> outside the lines and subject to capture or death {{at the hands of the}} enemy. Moreover, he was in a frame of mind unfavorable to repose. The cause of his perturbation of spirit was this: during the previous night he had served on the picket-guard, and had been posted as a sentinel in this very forest. The night was clear, though moonless, but in the gloom of the wood the darkness was deep. Grayrock's post was at a considerable distance from those to right and left, for the pickets had been thrown out a needless distance from the camp, making the line too long for the force detailed to occupy it. The war was young, and military camps entertained the error that while sleeping they were better protected by thin lines <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> out <b>toward</b> the enemy than by thicker ones close in. And surely they needed as long notice as possible of an enemy's approach, for they were at that time addicted to the practice of undressing--than which nothing could be more unsoldierly. On the morning of the memorable 6th of April, at Shiloh, many of Grant's men when spitted on Confederate bayonets were as naked as civilians; but it should be allowed that this was not because of any defect in their picket line. Their error was of another sort: they had no pickets. This is perhaps a vain digression. I should not care to undertake to interest the reader in the fate of an army; what we have here to consider is that of Private Grayrock.|$|R

40|$|An {{emerging}} trend in multiagent system {{research is the}} use of decentralized control models (notably the decentralized MDP formalism) as the basis for decision theoretic studies of multiagent problem solving. Research often focuses on the development of solution algorithms for some special classes of decentralized MDPs. While these studies will no doubt enhance our understanding of the formal foundations for multiagent system, they have <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go <b>toward</b> the actual making and deployment of decision-theoretic agents. This leads to the need for some new thinkings toward the role of MDPs in multiagent research. Since MDP policies define the mapping between an agent’s knowledge (information states) and its actions, they can be viewed as abstractions to, or be regarded as an external view of, the internal agent reasoning processes. As such, we propose the use of MDPs as a tool for agents to establish meta-level capabilities such as selfmonitoring and self-control. These capabilities are essential for agents to learn organizational knowledge. Furthermore, we also propose to apply this MDP formalism to the group level, to represent the group control and coordination knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{regeneration}} can be {{an effective}} tool to promote sustainability and enhance macro-level quality of life if the principles of encouraging participation, building community character, advancing equity, improving environment and enlivening the economy are observed. Through the assessment of various quality of life indicators related to these five basic principles for sustainable urban regeneration by the public, private and community sectors, this paper finds that Hong Kong falls far short of realizing these fundamental principles. There are also considerable discrepancies between the public and non-public (private and NGOs) sectors in terms of evaluating existing quality of life issues and perceiving their relative priorities. The private and community sectors tend to have lower rating of existing situation and consequently a longer priority list. On the contrary, the public sector seems to be more complacent with the existing quality of life situations and has a much shorter priority list. The public sector's more relaxed attitude coupled with a top-down executive-led polity mean that Hong Kong will probably have <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go <b>toward</b> sustainable urban regeneration. © Springer 2005. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
30|$|There {{are mainly}} four {{approaches}} to synthesize single-layered or few-layered graphene: micromechanical exfoliation, epitaxial growth, vapor deposition, and chemical reduction [64, 65, 66, 67]. Novoselov et al. used scotch tapes to repeatedly peel flakes of graphite off the mesas which were fixed onto a SiO 2 /Si substrate, and the high-purity, single-layered graphene was obtained [15]. By micromechanical exfoliation of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, crystalline graphene nanosheets with large surface areas {{and a small}} number of layers could be obtained [65]. This method is very simple and does not need any special facilities. However, it is limited to laboratory research because of the small size and inefficiency of the production. Berger and his co-workers got graphene thin films which exhibited remarkable two-dimensional (2 D) electron gas behaviors through thermal decomposition on the (0001) surface of 6 H-SiC [68]. Epitaxial growth, compared with mechanical exfoliation, can realize the preparation of graphene with larger sizes and higher qualities. Hence, this approach is of significant importance for graphene semiconductor devices. Although a great breakthrough has been made for this technique, there is still <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go <b>toward</b> mass production of the graphene with uniform thickness and acceptable cost. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the most extensively used method in industrial manufacture considering the merits of controllable sizes and structures. By pyrolysis of carbon-containing compounds, graphene was grown on the surfaces of transition metals, such as Cu [36], Pt [69], Ni [37], Ru [70], and Ir [71]. Copper foil is the most common substrate material to build single-layered graphene. Li and his group have successfully synthesized large-area and uniform graphene films on copper foils with a high quality by CVD techniques using methane as carbon source [36].|$|R

[...] Writing for Melody Maker in February 1998, Mark Roland drew comparisons with the music of St Etienne and Björk's Homogenic album, highlighting Ray of Lights lack of cynicism as its most positive aspect: [...] "It's not an album turned on the lathe of cynical pop manipulation, rather it's been squished out of a lump of clay on a foot-powered wheel. Lovingly teased into life, Ray of Light is like the ugly mug that doesn't match but is all the more special because of it."

40|$|With the {{acceleration}} of the urbanization and industrialization in China, {{it is inevitable that}} arable land converts to built-up areas for industrial and residential uses. The urbanization rate has increased form 17 percent in the late 1970 s to 39 percent in 2002. As we all know, during the end of 1980 s and the beginning of 1990 s, China has experienced a rapid urban growth, which was the so-called "great mass fever" on real estate development and establishment of Development Zones. However, compared with the developed countries whose urbanization rate exceeded 70 percent in general, China has <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go <b>toward</b> urbanization according to the theory of urban development. Thus there will be more arable land conversion in the future, which would impose pressure both on food security and on the sustainability of urbanization itself. In view of this, the spatial-temporal characteristics of arable land conversion and its driving forces of the large-scale cities in China in the 1990 s are of importance to be analyzed. Based on the three-time Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) digital images and statistic data of Beijing, it analyses the arable land conversion and its driving forces in this paper. Some conclusions were drawn as follows: During the early- 1990 s to mid- 1990 s, the rate of arable land converting to built-up area in Beijing is 14. 4 %. Of all the converted arable land, 45. 7 % was converted to built-up area and 90. 6 % was converted from arable land in all the new built-up land. Accordingly, the figure is 4. 60 / 9, 52. 1 % and 80. 7 % respectively in the latter period. Arable land conversion to built-up land {{played an important role in}} cultivated land losing. At the same time, factors such as population increase, development of the national economy and changes of urban development planning had significant effects on this conversion...|$|R
