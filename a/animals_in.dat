5|$|An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory {{begins by}} {{discussing}} {{the history of}} <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> political theory before considering the approaches taken {{to the status of}} animals by five schools of political theory: utilitarianism, liberalism, communitarianism, Marxism and feminism.

5|$|Anchoring near Darwin Bay, Beebe {{made his}} first attempt at {{studying}} sea <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> their native environment by descending into the ocean in a diving helmet. Beebe continued to perform helmet dives throughout his Galápagos expedition, documenting several previously unknown sea <b>animals.</b> <b>In</b> addition to his helmet dives, Beebe applied the same method of research that he had pioneered in the tropics to a small area of ocean, sailing in circles around it for ten days {{with the intention of}} documenting all actions and interactions of marine life within that area. This study yielded a collection of 3,776 fish of 136 species, many of them also new to science.|$|E
5|$|Animal Rights Without Liberation: Applied Ethics and Human Obligations is a 2012 book by the British {{political}} theorist Alasdair Cochrane, {{in which}} it is argued that animal rights philosophy can be decoupled from animal liberation philosophy by the adoption of the interest-based rights approach. Cochrane, arguing that there is no reason that (nonhuman) animals should be excluded from justice, adopts Joseph Raz's account of interest rights and extends it to include animals. He argues that sentient animals possess a right not to be made to suffer and a right not to be killed, but not a right to freedom. The book's chapters apply Cochrane's account to a number of interactions between humans and animals; first animal experimentation, then animal agriculture, the genetic engineering of animals, the use of <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> entertainment and sport, the relationship of animals to environmental practices and the use of <b>animals</b> <b>in</b> cultural practices.|$|E
