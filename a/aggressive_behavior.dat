40|$|A {{behavioral}} {{study was}} performed {{in an attempt to}} clarify an interaction between the GABA-b and the adenosine A_ 1 receptors in <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviors</b> induced by clonidine in mice. Mice administered high doses of clonidine (20 - 30 mg/kg i. p.) exhibited <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviors</b> such as biting and attacking. Baclofen (1 - 5 mg/kg), a GABA-b receptor agonist, inhabited the <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviors</b> induced by clonidine (20 mg/kg) in dose-dependent manner. Caffeine (5 - 10 mg/kg), an adenosine (A_ 1 ＞A_ 2) receptor antagonist, markedly potentiated the <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The inhibitory effect og baclofen (1 mg/kg) on the <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviors</b> induced by clonidine (20 mg/kg) was antagonized by caffeine (5 mg/kg). Furthermore the stimulatory effedt of caffeine (5 mg/kg) was reversed by baclofen. Aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA : 30 mg/kg), a GABA transaminase inhabitor, also reduced clonidine (30 ng/kg) induced <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The inhibitory effect of AOAA tended to be increaced by bicuculline (2 mg/kg), a GABA-a receptor antagonist, but did not significantly. The inhibitory effect of combined treatment with AOAA and bicuculline on the <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviors</b> was antagonized by caffeine (1 mg/kg), whereas the stimulatory effect of caffeine on the behaviors was reversed by combined treatment with these drugs. The results suggest that since either baclofen (GABA-b receptor agonist) or AOAA (endogenous GABA) in hibits colonidine-induced <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviors</b> which are potentiated by caffeine, an adenosine receptor antagonist, these agents may be, in part, similar to the mode of action of adenosine receptor agonist...|$|R

5|$|The {{study of}} cuticle {{hydrocarbons}} {{has also been}} applied to the reproductive workers. In some colonies of the ponerine ant Platythyrea punctata, the presence of CHCs in new reproductive workers triggered <b>aggressive</b> <b>behavior</b> {{from the rest of}} the colony, often between new and old reproductive workers. Specifically, the old reproductive workers rubbed a marker hydrocarbon on the antennae of the new females, identifying them as rivals and targets for aggression.|$|E
5|$|Amplexus {{lasts for}} 10 to 15 minutes. Once mated, the males will defend the females {{for a short}} period (around 15 minutes). After this period, the females begin to exhibit <b>aggressive</b> <b>behavior</b> and will drive off the males. They will then bend their fourth and fifth pereonites at a 90-degree angle. Once their genital {{openings}} (located on the fifth pereonite) are aligned {{with the opening of the}} brood pouches, they quickly deposit fertilized eggs into them. Females carrying fertilized eggs remain highly aggressive towards males throughout the brooding period, indicating maternal behavior intended to protect the developing embryo from male aggression.|$|E

A study in 2009 on the native populations of Caprella linearis, a smaller caprellid species in the Helgoland region of the German Bight in the North Sea, have revealed that C. linearis have more or less vanished and have been replaced by C. mutica. C. mutica fouling populations may also incur minor economic effects through the cost of their removal from submerged aquaculture equipment and ship hulls.|$|E
5|$|A {{small group}} of {{toddlers}} show a distressing way of reuniting after a separation. Called a disorganized/disoriented style, this reunion pattern can involve looking dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors that seem to imply fearfulness {{of the person who}} is being sought. Disorganized attachment has been considered a major risk factor for child psychopathology, as it appears to interfere with regulation or tolerance of negative emotions and may thus foster <b>aggressive</b> <b>behavior.</b> Disorganized patterns of attachment have the strongest links to concurrent and subsequent psychopathology, and considerable research has demonstrated both within-the-child and environmental correlates of disorganized attachment.|$|E

5|$|Externalizing {{disorders}} (i.e., acting-out disorders) show {{a clearer}} link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and <b>aggressive</b> <b>behavior</b> are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents, as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis. Interestingly, a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ). This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification, and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{standardized}} diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the DSM and ICD, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on <b>aggressive</b> <b>behavior</b> as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.|$|E
5|$|In {{designing}} the levels, Newcomer added platforms {{to the environment}} after the combat was devised. A static game world was chosen over a scrolling world to showcase visual textures applied to the platforms. The hardware could not easily display the textures while scrolling, and the team felt that displaying the whole environment would aid players. The last game world element was a lava pit and a hand reaching out of it to destroy characters {{too close to the}} bottom. Newcomer placed the platforms to optimize Pfutzenrueter's enemy artificial intelligence (AI), which factors attack patterns based partly on platform placements. The knight enemies were designed to exhibit progressively more <b>aggressive</b> <b>behavior.</b> Bounders fly around the environment randomly, occasionally reacting to the protagonist. Hunters seek the player's character in an effort to collide. Shadow Lords fly quickly and closer {{to the top of the}} screen. Pfutzenrueter designed them to fly higher when close to the protagonist to increase the Shadow Lord's chances of victory against the player. The pterodactyl was designed to attack idle players and be difficult to defeat. The only vulnerability was attacking the creature in its open mouth during a specific animation frame. Newcomer and Pfutzenrueter designed the pterodactyl to quickly fly upward at the last moment when approaching a player waiting at the edge of a platform. This was done to prevent an easy defeat of the enemy. When processing the graphics, the game gives priority to the player characters over the enemies. As a result, enemies begin to react more slowly when the number of on-screen sprites increases.|$|E

40|$|Background. <b>Aggressive</b> <b>behaviors</b> must be {{addressed}} in elementary schools. Massage and storytelling can be strategies to deal with aggression because both involve experience exchange and social interaction. Both can decrease stress and anxiety and increase self-esteem. Objective. To evaluate the effect of two interventions (massage and storytelling) on <b>aggressive</b> <b>behaviors</b> and academic performance of elementary school children. Method. Three groups (n= 35 children in each group) of the second grade participated (aged 6. 5 – 8. 1 years). One group received ten extra classes of massage (MG), another group received extra classes of storytelling (SG), and the control group received extra classes of random subjects (CG). Extra classes lasted for 50 minutes, once a week. <b>Aggressive</b> <b>behaviors</b> were recorded on diaries, by the teachers and the coordinator.

5|$|When {{examining}} Sue, paleontologist Pete Larson found {{a broken}} and healed fibula and tail vertebrae, scarred facial bones and a tooth from another Tyrannosaurus {{embedded in a}} neck vertebra. If correct, these might be strong evidence for <b>aggressive</b> <b>behavior</b> between tyrannosaurs but whether {{it would have been}} competition for food and mates or active cannibalism is unclear. Further recent investigation of these purported wounds has shown that most are infections rather than injuries (or simply damage to the fossil after death) and the few injuries are too general to be indicative of intraspecific conflict. Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. Top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics that only small dromaeosaurs and troodontids remain as feasible top predators. In this light, scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators, although they may have had a hard time finding enough meat to scavenge, being outnumbered by smaller theropods. Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a scavenger like most large carnivores.|$|E
