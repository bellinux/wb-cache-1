5|$|Despite the {{inherent}} difficulties in accounting for inflation, several {{attempts have been}} made. Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses, and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also impact upon the calculations, both of which can {{have an effect on}} the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. Gone with the Wind—first released in 1939—is generally considered to be the most successful film, with Guinness World Records in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4 billion. Estimates for Gone with the Winds <b>adjusted</b> <b>gross</b> have varied substantially: its owner, Turner Entertainment, estimated its adjusted earnings at $3.3 billion in 2007, a few years earlier than the Guinness estimate; other estimates fall either side of this amount, with one putting its gross just under $3 billion in 2010, while another provided an alternative figure of $3.8 billion in 2006. Which film is Gone with the Winds nearest rival depends on the set of figures used: Guinness had Avatar in second place with $3 billion, while other estimates saw Titanic in the runner-up spot with first-run worldwide earnings of almost $2.9 billion at 2010 prices. The only other film that all sources agreed grossed in excess of $2 billion at recent prices is Star Wars; according to Guinness it has earned $2.8 billion at 2014 price levels, while other sources from 2010/2011 put its adjusted earnings at $2.2–2.6 billion.|$|E

25|$|Under a Roth IRA, first {{enacted in}} 1998, individuals, whether {{employees}} or self-employed, voluntarily contribute post-tax funds {{to an individual}} retirement arrangement (IRA). In contrast to the 401(k) plan, the Roth plan requires post-tax contributions, but allows for tax free growth and distribution, provided the contributions have been invested for at least 5 years and the account owner has reached age 59½. Roth IRA contribution limits are significantly lower than 401(k) contribution limits. For tax-years 2016 and 2017, individuals may contribute no more than $5,500 per year to a Roth IRA if under age 50, and $6,500 if age 50 or older. Additionally, Roth IRA contribution limits are reduced for taxpayers with a Modified <b>Adjusted</b> <b>Gross</b> Income (modified AGI) greater than $117,000 ($184,000 for married filing jointly), phasing out entirely for individuals with a modified AGI of $132,000 ($194,000 for married filing jointly), for 2016.

40|$|This report {{discusses}} three {{methods of}} valuing property for ad valorem purposes, describes their application to property taxation by several states, and draws {{a distinction between}} the method of valuation and adjustments to value. The value of a property for taxation purposes is determined in two steps: appraisal and assessment. In everyday language, these two terms are used interchangeably; however, their differences must be understood. Key to this understanding is a firm grasp of the differences between valuing property and adjusting these values by deductions or other limits. Property APPRAISAL determines a properties monetary value, or “gross assessed value. ” Fair taxation requires uniform property appraisals: similar properties must be appraised at similar value (International Association of Assessing Officers 2004, p. 13). In Indiana, property appraisal is performed by elected county and/or township assessors. On the other hand, property ASSESSMENT <b>adjusts</b> <b>gross</b> assessed value to arrive at “net assessed value. ” The legislature determines the adjustments to real property appraised values. In Indiana, the county auditor applies the deductions, exemptions, and/or limits authorized by the state legislature.

40|$|Growth of {{monetary}} assets and debts is commonly {{described by the}} formula of compound interest which for the case of continuous compounding is the exponential growth law. Its differential form is dc/dt = i c where dc/dt describes the rate {{of monetary}} growth, i the compounded interest rate and c the actual principal. Exponential growth of this type is fixed to be neither resource-limited nor self-limiting which {{is in contrast to}} real economic growth (such as the GDP) which may have exponential, but also subexponential, linear, saturation, and even decline phases. As a result assets and debts commonly outgrow their economic fundament giving rise to the financial equivalent of Malthusian catastrophes after a certain interval of time. We here introduce an alternative for exponential compounding and propose to replace dc/dt = i c by dc/dt = i c^p where the exponent p (called reaction order in chemistry) is a quantity which will be termed monetary growth order. The monetary growth order p is seen as a tuning handle which enables to <b>adjust</b> <b>gross</b> monetary growth to real economic growth. It is suggested that the central banks take a serious look to this control instrument which allows tuning in crisis situations and immediate return to the exponential norm if needed.

25|$|A Roth 401(k) plan is {{probably}} most advantageous {{to those who}} might otherwise choose a Roth IRA, such as younger workers who are currently taxed in a lower tax bracket but expect to be taxed in a higher bracket upon reaching retirement age. Higher-income workers may prefer a traditional 401(k) plan because they are currently taxed in a higher tax bracket but would expect to be taxed at a lower rate in retirement; also, those near the Roth IRA income limits may prefer a traditional 401(k) since its pre-tax contributions lowers Modified <b>Adjusted</b> <b>Gross</b> Income (MAGI) and thus increases eligibility for various other tax incentives (Roth IRA contributions, the Child Tax Credit, medical expense deduction, etc.). Another consideration for those currently in higher tax brackets {{is the future of}} income tax rates in the US: if income tax rates increase, current taxation would be desirable for a wider group). The Roth 401(k) offers the advantage of tax free distribution but is not constrained by the same income limitations. For example, in tax year 2013, normal Roth IRA contributions are limited to $5,500 ($6,500 if age 50 or older); up to $17,500 could be contributed to a Roth 401(k) account if no other elective deferrals were taken for the tax year, such as traditional 401(k) deferrals.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{long-term}} effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films. The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases. To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars.
