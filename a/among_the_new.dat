5|$|After the war, the hoarded Flying Eagle cents re-entered circulation. Many {{remained}} there {{only a few}} years, being pulled out from <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> bronze cents in Treasury Department redemption programs in the 1860s and 1870s—thirteen million copper-nickel cents were retired by exchange for other base-metal coinage. By the 1880s, it was a rarity in circulation. The 2018 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the 1857, 1858 large letters, and 1858 small letters each at $30 in G-4 Good condition, the next to lowest collectable grade (AG-3). The 1856 is $6,500 in that grade, rising to $20,000 in uncirculated MS-63. The 1858/7 starts at $75 in G-4, rising to $11,000 in MS-63. An 1856 cent in MS-66 condition sold at auction in January 2004 for $172,500.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{reorganization}} of legal education in Ontario in the mid-1950s, Queen's Faculty of Law opened in 1957 in the newly built John A. Macdonald Hall. Other construction projects at Queen's in the 1950s included the construction of Richardson Hall to house Queen's administrative offices, and Dunning Hall. By {{the end of the}} 1960s, like many other universities in Canada, Queen's tripled its enrolment and greatly expanded its faculty, staff, and facilities, {{as a result of the}} baby boom and generous support from the public sector. By the mid-1970s, the number of full-time students had reached 10,000. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> facilities were three more residences and separate buildings for the Departments of Mathematics, Physics, Biology and Psychology, Social Sciences and the Humanities.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to industrial growth, the 1880s and 1890s were {{a period of}} significant growth in downtown commercial building. The retail district was centered at Fourth Street and Washington Avenue, while banking and business was centered to the south, at Fourth and Olive streets. During the 1890s, significant retailers and businesses moved westward; <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> buildings constructed {{as a result of}} this movement was the Wainwright Building. Designed by Louis Sullivan in 1891, the Wainwright was the tallest building in the city at the time of its construction and remains an example of early skyscraper design.|$|E

Masterton was {{the first player to}} sign with Minnesota, agreeing to a two-year contract. He said {{prior to the start of}} the 1967–68 season that being able to play in Minnesota was key as he would have been unlikely to consider an offer with any other team.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival in}} New Orleans of Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie {{as the new}} {{governor}} of Louisiana in June 1763 led to changes in colonial policies. D'Abbadie quickly moved to grant trade monopolies in the middle Mississippi Valley to stimulate the economy. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> monopolists was Pierre Laclede, who along with his stepson Auguste Chouteau set out in August 1763 to build a fur trading post near {{the confluence of the}} Missouri and Mississippi rivers. The settlement of St. Louis was established at a site south of the confluence on {{the west bank of the}} Mississippi on February 15, 1764, by Chouteau and a group of about 30 men. Laclede arrived at the site by mid-1764 and provided detailed plans for the village, including a street grid and market area.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer and}} former MP Matthew Parris {{described}} Thorpe {{as one of}} the more dashing <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> MPs elected in 1959. Thorpe's chief political interest lay in the field of human rights, and his speeches criticising apartheid in South Africa attracted the attention of the South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS), who took note of this rising Liberal star. Thorpe was briefly considered as best man at the 1960 wedding of his Eton contemporary Antony Armstrong-Jones to Princess Margaret, but was rejected when vetting checks indicated that he might have homosexual tendencies. The security agency MI5, which routinely keeps records on all members of parliament, added this information to Thorpe's file.|$|E

5|$|Washington had {{established}} his preeminence <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> nation's Founding Fathers through his service as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War and {{as president of}} the 1787 Constitutional Convention. Once the Constitution was approved, it was widely expected that Washington would become the first President of the United States, despite his own desire to retire from public life. In his first inaugural address expressed both his reluctance to accept the presidency and his inexperience with the duties of civil administration, but Washington proved an able leader.|$|E
5|$|Any {{pretense of}} cordiality between Cope and Marsh ended in 1872, and by spring 1873 open hostility ensued. At the same time, Leidy, Cope and Marsh were making great discoveries of ancient {{reptiles}} and mammals in the Western bone beds. The paleontologists {{had a habit}} of making hasty telegrams eastward describing their finds, only publishing fuller accounts after returning from trips. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> specimens described by the men were Uintatherium, Loxolophodon, Eobasileus, Dinoceras, and Tinoceras. The problem was that many of these finds were not uniquely different from each other; in fact, Cope and Marsh knew that some of the fossils they were collecting had already been found by the others. As it turned out, many of Marsh's names were valid, while none of Cope's were. Marsh also placed the new species into a new order of mammals, Cinocerea. Cope was humiliated and powerless to stop his rival's changes. Instead, he published a broad analytical study where he proposed a new plan of classification for the Eocene mammals, in which he discarded Marsh's genera in favor of his own. Marsh remained steadfast and continued to claim that all of Cope's names for Dinocerata were incorrect.|$|E
5|$|By the 1840s, Romanticism {{had largely}} supplanted Neoclassicism, {{not only in}} painting, but also in {{sculpture}} and architecture. The Academy did not resume its role of simply providing education: prizes, medals, scholarships in foreign countries and funding were used as incentives. Among its staff and students {{were some of the}} most renowned Brazilian artists, including Simplício Rodrigues de Sá, Félix Taunay, Manuel de Araújo Porto-alegre, Pedro Américo, Victor Meirelles, Rodolfo Amoedo, Almeida Júnior, Rodolfo Bernardelli and João Zeferino da Costa. In the 1880s, after having been long regarded as the official style of the Academy, Romanticism declined, and other styles were explored by a new generation of artists. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> genres was Landscape art, the most famous exponents of which were Georg Grimm, Giovanni Battista Castagneto, França Júnior and Antônio Parreiras. Another style which gained popularity in the fields of painting and architecture was Eclecticism.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19thcentury, the European American {{newcomers}} had begun to remove vegetation, build sawmills, fell trees, fill wetlands, and farm in the fertile soil along Johnson Creek. The creek is named for one of these newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood of Portland and operated a water-powered sawmill. In early 1848 Lot Whitcomb, who would later found Milwaukie, filed a donation land claim and built a sawmill near the confluence of Johnson Creek and the Willamette River. In 1886, plans were made for train tracks along the creek. In 1903, the Springwater Division Line, also known as the Portland Traction Company Line, the Cazadero Line, and the Bellrose Line, was built along Johnson Creek to provide rail transport for passengers and freight. Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Lents, and Pleasant Valley were <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> communities that grew up along the line. By the 1920s, housing began to replace creekside farms.|$|E
5|$|Clinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey's Little Rock {{law firm}} of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings. In 1982, he was elected {{governor}} a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas's economy and improved the state's educational system. For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption. He became a leading figure <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level. Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address and served {{as chair of the}} National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, the {{residents}} of Romney set about repairing public buildings and reestablishing the town's antebellum institutions, including the Romney Literary Society. The society remained on a hiatus until May 15, 1869 when a meeting was held by nine members, as only nine original members had responded to the call for reorganization. These nine members tasked with rebuilding the society were James L. Armstrong, David Entler, William Harper, John C. Heiskell, Andrew Wodrow Kercheval, Samuel R. Lupton, James Parsons, Alfred P. White, and Robert White. These men sought to collect {{what remained of the}} library's books and engaged in a campaign to recruit new members, which resulted in the enrollment of 20 younger men over a period of a few years. Many of the men who had been members in 1861 had died during the war, and the recruitment of new members was essential to the revival of the society. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> members elected between 1869 and 1886 were John Collins Covell, Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy, Henry Bell Gilkeson, Howard Hille Johnson, and Christian Streit White. The society, with renewed vigor, took a lead role in Romney's civil development during the Reconstruction Era.|$|E
50|$|<b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> {{experimental}} treatments is {{the study}} of glucocorticoid antagonists, including mifepristone. These strategies may treat the underlying pathophysiology of psychotic depression by correcting an overactive HPA axis.
