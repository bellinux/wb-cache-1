5|$|Blacktip sharks showing curiosity towards divers {{has been}} reported, but they remain <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>distance.</b> Under most circumstances, these timid sharks are not {{regarded}} as highly dangerous to humans. However, they may become aggressive {{in the presence}} of food, and their size and speed invite respect. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File lists 28 unprovoked attacks (one fatal) and 13 provoked attacks by this species. Blacktip sharks are responsible annually for 16% of the shark attacks around Florida. Most attacks by this species result in only minor wounds.|$|E
5|$|Union {{infantry}} attacked {{from the}} east side of the battlefield, while most of the cavalry attacked from the south and west. Capehart's brigade attacked from the southwest, and eventually was on the extreme western side of the battlefield. At times, the cavalry fought dismounted, with their horses led <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> behind. The opposing forces were always within range of the Union cavalry carbines, keeping the weapon's seven-shot advantage—and not enabling the Confederate infantry to utilize the advantage of their longer range weapons.|$|E
5|$|Special {{technical}} solutions had to {{be designed}} for the accommodations for three adults to be confined in a small balloon basket for up to 30 days. The sleeping berths for the crew were fitted at {{the floor of the}} basket, along with some of stores and provisions. The highly flammable hydrogen meant that cooking could not be done in the basket itself. The solution was a modified primus stove (designed by a friend of Andrée's) that could be dangled 8m (26ft) below the crew and then lit from the basket, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>distance.</b> An angled mirror attached to the specially designed stove allowed the crew to determine whether it was successfully lit or not.|$|E

5|$|The commotion {{caused by}} the stoor worm's writhing agonies draws a crowd to the beach, and Assipattle lands safely among them. The ferocity of the fire burning in the creature's liver increases, causing smoke clouds to be {{expelled}} from its mouth and nostrils, turning the skies black. The islanders, believing {{that the world is}} about to end, clamber up a hillside to watch the final death throes of the creature <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> from the resulting tidal waves and earthquakes. As it dies, the creature's teeth fall out to become the islands of Orkney, Shetland and the Faroes. The Baltic Sea is created where its tongue falls out, and when the creature finally curls up into a tight knot and dies, its body becomes Iceland. True to his word, once the skies clear and the earth settles, the king relinquishes his kingdom to Assipattle, who marries Princess Gem-de-lovely. As promised, the king also gives Odin's magic sword to Assipattle.|$|E
5|$|Zur was {{extremely}} reluctant to withdraw his personal forces. He {{decided to do}} so only at 09:00, {{when it became clear}} that the other two companies were <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>distance,</b> and the Egyptians were massing for a counterattack. First, the injured were evacuated, then the rest of the forces made their way back, each squad providing cover for the next. The Egyptian artillery caused the forces to scatter, and the commanders had difficulty diverting them to the general retreat path. After they came to a small grove to the west of the main road, it was discovered that three were missing and 17 injured, who were treated by the only remaining medic. Approximately at noon, Zur's men met with Dromi and Harpaz, and the working communication device was used to summon vehicles to take the soldiers to Gan Yavne.|$|E
5|$|Although the Royal Navy {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as vital to the rise of the British Empire, the British Army {{played an important role in}} the formation of colonies, protectorates and dominions in the Americas, Africa, Asia, India and Australasia. British soldiers captured strategically-important territories, and the army was involved in wars to secure the empire's borders and support friendly governments. Among these actions were the Seven Years' War, the American Revolutionary War, the Napoleonic Wars, the First and Second Opium Wars, the Boxer Rebellion, the New Zealand Wars, the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857, the first and second Boer Wars, the Fenian raids, the Irish War of Independence, interventions in Afghanistan (intended to maintain a buffer state between British India and the Russian Empire) and the Crimean War (to keep the Russian Empire <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> by aiding Turkey). Like the English Army, the British Army fought the kingdoms of Spain, France (including the Empire of France) and the Netherlands for supremacy in North America and the West Indies. With native and provincial assistance, the army conquered New France in the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War and suppressed a Native American uprising in Pontiac's War. The British Army was defeated in the American Revolutionary War, losing the Thirteen Colonies but retaining The Canadas and The Maritimes as British North America.|$|E

5000|$|In 1651, Stuyvesant {{declared}} {{the jurisdiction of}} the fort to extend 600 paces around the fort, thereby severing it from Rensselaerswyck; he appointed Johannes Dyckman as commissary of Fort Orange. In 1652, Stuyvesant, to settle this dispute once and for all, set up a [...] "Court of Justice for the Village of Beverwyck and its dependencies", the first municipal government for the future city of Albany. At the time when Beverwyck consisted of roughly 100 structures huddled next to the fort, Stuyvesant set up Beverwyck <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>distance</b> from the cannons of the fort and laid out future Albany's oldest streets- State Street and Broadway.|$|R
25|$|Attacking pieces {{can easily}} become trapped behind enemy lines, as the {{opponent}} can often drop a pawn on a protected square {{to cut off}} the line of retreat. For this reason, rooks, which can retreat in only one direction, are commonly kept <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> in the early parts of the game, and used to support attacks by weaker pieces. However, once the game has opened up, a promoted rook is an especially deadly piece behind enemy lines.|$|E
25|$|Concerns over {{inadequate}} {{warnings and}} safeguards have included that the two-foot wide yellow platform markings may not keep people <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> as trains pass at high speed. Suggestions include platform safety barriers, {{or use of}} different announcements for approaching Acela trains versus slower ones. In 2011, federal transportation grants were awarded to improve Kingston station, including {{the construction of a}} third track to be used by the Acela as a through track to bypass the station, helping to alleviate safety concerns.|$|E
25|$|The launch {{countdown}} began 10 June 2009, but on 13 June 2009, as tanking was underway, a {{gaseous hydrogen}} leak on a vent line near the Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate was observed, and the 13 June 2009 launch was scrubbed at 00:26 EDT. As liquid hydrogen fuel is pumped in, {{some of it}} boils off as the extremely cold liquid enters the warm external tank. The vent line valve controls the resulting buildup of gas pressure by allowing excess gas to escape into a ground-side vent line, {{which leads to a}} flare stack <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> away from the pad. A similar leak situation was seen during the first launch attempt of STS-119. NASA managers met on 14 June 2009 and 15 June 2009 and evaluated the leak, discussed steps that had to be taken, and set a new launch date of 17 June 2009, at 05:40 EDT.|$|E

25|$|In the 16th and 17th centuries, new siege {{weapons and}} techniques, {{including}} {{the advent of}} artillery, forced the city to modernize the defences {{in order to keep}} potential attackers <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> from the walls, including the addition of ditches, bastions and ravelins. Monterey Fort was the most important defensive work, its name coming from the Spanish count responsible for modernizing the defences. The fort was built between 1672 and 1675 on the heights of Obbrussel (Upper Brussels, now Saint-Gilles), south of the Halle Gate, by the military engineers Merex and Blom. As {{with the rest of the}} city's fortifications, the fort was ineffective, and was not able to prevent the French bombardment of Brussels in 1695, from the heights of Scheut, in Anderlecht, as part of the War of the Grand Alliance. The defensive works proved equally ineffective when French troops seized the city in 1746 during the War of the Austrian Succession, afterwards leaving the defensive works in ruins. By that time, siege was no longer an important part of warfare. Due to the growth of commerce and improved roads, the fortifications did little more than frustrate transit into and out of the city.|$|E

Bouldering enabled climbers to practice specific moves <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> from the ground. Additionally, the sport served to build stamina and increase finger strength. [...] Throughout the 1900s, bouldering evolved into a separate discipline. Individual problems are assigned ratings based on their difficulty.

5000|$|Landskrona's {{military}} importance declined {{after the}} 18th century. The continued Swedish-Danish wars led to Karlskrona replacing Landskrona as a naval base, {{as it is}} located <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>distance</b> from Denmark. Although the fortifications at Landskrona were expanded considerably between 1747 and 1788, they were condemned in 1822, whereafter the garrison was abolished in 1869. The last military regiment, Skånska Husarregimentet, K5 was renamed and moved from Landskrona to Uppsala in 1926. [...] Today the walls and moats of the fortifications of Landskrona Citadel are a recreational area and the castle holds a museum. On the northern side, an allotment-garden area of cottages was founded in {{the final years of}} the 19th century, and is today the oldest of its kind in Sweden.

500|$|According to a War Office {{training}} pamphlet dated 29 August 1940, {{the sticky}} bomb {{should be regarded}} as a portable demolition device which can be [...] "quickly and easily applied". It was reckoned to be effective against armour of up to one inch (25mm) thickness and was suitable for use against [...] "baby" [...] tanks, armoured cars and the vulnerable points on medium and heavy tanks. The safest and easiest application was simply to drop it from an upstairs window; otherwise, it could be used in an ambush of mobile tanks moving along a narrow road or in an attack on tanks parked up for the night. The sticky bomb could be either thrown or slapped in place by hand, in the latter case, the advice was to use sufficient force to break the glass thereby creating a greater area of contact resulting in a more effective explosion. Finally, there was also the option of placing the bomb first and then pulling out the pin <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> by means of a length of string.|$|E
500|$|In 608, the Exarchate of Africa under Heraclius the Elder revolted against Emperor Phocas. The {{subsequent}} {{campaign against}} Phocas was portrayed by Byzantine historians as avenging {{the death of}} Maurice, {{which might have been}} part of the motivation of this revolt. The other part, however, would be what Walter Emil Kaegi termed [...] "cold political calculations": Carthage was <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> <b>distance</b> from Constantinople and Phocas could not easily launch an attack against it. The relative wealth of the Exarchate of Africa could well enough finance a revolt. Phocas's regime arguably needed the grain and revenues from Africa, while the Exarchate sustained itself with relative ease. Meanwhile, the Persian shah Khosrau II had secured control of Dara and was mobilizing his troops for a large-scale invasion into Byzantine territories. News of this campaign could have well reached Heraclius the Elder. With Phocas facing two separate military fronts, the emperor would be unable to concentrate the majority of his troops on either one of them, encouraging Heraclius the Elder of his chances to succeed in this confrontation.|$|E

The bow always played an important role not only on the battlefield, but also in hunting. It was also considered as a sacred weapon and additionally a royal symbol. Bow and arrow were considered as a superior weapon in comparison with other types of weapons because one could fight with them <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> <b>distance</b> as one offered by swords, maces and axes. The first part of the article presents a short history of the bow in Iran. Based on historical Persian manuscripts, the next part explains the structure of the composite bow and the materials used for making it. The third part describes some types of bows based on the material, place of production, the usage, and bow type based on the length of the bow and the arrows. The following part talks about different types of arrows based on morphology of arrowheads, the type of plume/feather, the material of the shaft, the material of the arrowhead, the length of arrows, the target of arrows, the place of production of arrowheads and terms for describing its different features of an arrowhead. Then, the article talks about different types of thumb rings, bowstrings, quivers and bow cases and arrow guides for shooting short arrows. The next part discusses different principles of archery as explained in Persian manuscripts. Finally the article describes different archery targets. </p...|$|R
