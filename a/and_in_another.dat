The latter remark attracted as much criticism as anything else in his career.|$|E

5|$|Awake {{centers on}} Michael Britten (Isaacs), a detective living in two {{separate}} realities after a car crash. In one reality, in which he wears a red wristband, his wife Hannah Britten (Laura Allen) survived the collision, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>another</b> reality, in which he wears a green wristband, his son Rex Britten (Dylan Minnette) survived. In this episode, Michael passes out during a bungee jump while he is at a carnival with Rex and Emma (Daniela Bobadilla). He is unable to switch realities, consistently hallucinates and realizes that Ed Hawkins (Kevin Weisman), a detective who is working with Michael's former partner Bird (Steve Harris), was attempting to kill him in the crash. Meanwhile, Hannah deals with Emma's new baby by trying to convince her parents to let her keep the baby.|$|E
5|$|Fixtures {{include a}} marble font which is {{contemporary}} with the church. There is much stained glass: the oldest, {{in the form}} of heraldic emblems in cartouches, dates from 1562 and is visible in the Diocletian window in the east wall <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>another</b> window on the southwest side. The east window was erected in memory of Sir Frank Stapleton, rector of Mereworth 1832–74. Other similar glass dates from the 17th and 18th centuries. Another, depicting the Raising of Lazarus, was designed by Frederic Shields for the Heaton, Butler and Bayne firm in 1889.|$|E

5|$|The Incas {{arranged}} their empire {{to demonstrate}} their cosmology. The capital, Cusco, was at {{the centre of the}} empire and connected to it by means of ceques, conceptually straight lines radiating out from the centre. These ceques connected the centre of the empire to the four suyus, which were regions defined by their direction from Cusco. The notion of a quartered cosmos is common across the Andes. Gary Urton, who has conducted fieldwork in the Andean villagers of Misminay, has connected this quartering with the appearance of the Milky Way in the night sky. In one season it will bisect the sky <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>another</b> bisect it in a perpendicular fashion.|$|E
5|$|After {{the capture}} of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the Byzantine Empire was {{partitioned}} between the Crusaders, while three Greek successor states were set up, the Despotate of Epirus, the Empire of Trebizond, and the Empire of Nicaea, each claiming the Byzantine imperial title. The former did not maintain a fleet, the Trapezuntine navy was minuscule and mostly used for patrols and transporting troops, while the Nicaeans initially followed a policy of consolidation and used their fleet for coastal defence. Under John III Vatatzes (1222–1254), a more energetic foreign policy was pursued, and in 1225, the Nicaean fleet was able to occupy the islands of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, and Icaria. It was, however, {{no match for the}} Venetians: attempting to blockade Constantinople in 1235, the Nicaean navy was defeated by a far smaller Venetian force, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>another</b> similar attempt in 1241, the Nicaeans were again routed. Nicaean efforts during the 1230s to support a local rebellion in Crete against Venice were also only partially successful, with the last Nicaean troops being forced to leave the island in 1236. Aware of the weakness of his navy, in March 1261 the Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (1259–1282) concluded the Treaty of Nymphaeum with the Genoese, securing their aid against Venice at sea, in return for commercial privileges.|$|E
5|$|At Judgment Day on May 21, 2006, MNM {{lost their}} titles to Paul London and Brian Kendrick. After the match, Melina and Nitro, {{as part of}} the storyline, {{attacked}} Mercury, blaming him for the loss. Later that night, Melina lost a singles match against Jillian Hall, and after slapping General Manager Theodore Long in anger, she and Nitro were fired from the SmackDown! brand. The team then broke up because off-screen, Nitro and Mercury did not get along, and WWE management decided to send Nitro and Melina to the Raw brand. Melina and Nitro debuted on Raw on May 29, with Nitro losing to WWE Champion John Cena. Melina continued to manage Nitro during his successful hunt for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>another</b> storyline with Trish Stratus. The storyline turned into a tag team feud when Carlito teamed with Stratus after he saved her from the attacks of Melina and Nitro. At Saturday Night's Main Event on July 15, Melina and Nitro lost to Carlito and Stratus in a mixed tag team match.|$|E

5|$|Augustine built {{a church}} at his {{foundation}} of Sts Peter and Paul Abbey at Canterbury, later renamed St Augustine's Abbey. This church was destroyed after the Norman Conquest {{to make way}} for a new abbey church. The mission also established Augustine's cathedral at Canterbury, which became Christ Church Priory. This church has not survived, and it is unclear if the church that was destroyed in 1067 and described by the medieval writer Eadmer as Augustine's church, was built by Augustine. Another medieval chronicler, Florence of Worcester, claimed that the priory was destroyed in 1011, and Eadmer himself had contradictory stories about the events of 1011, in one place claiming that the church was destroyed by fire <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>another</b> claiming only that it was looted. A cathedral was also established in Rochester; although the building was destroyed in 676, the bishopric continued in existence. Other church buildings were erected by the missionaries in London, York, and possibly Lincoln, although none of them survive.|$|E
5|$|Culann {{the smith}} invites Conchobar to a feast at his house. Before going, Conchobar {{goes to the}} playing field to watch the boys play hurling. He is so {{impressed}} by Sétanta's performance that he asks him to join him at the feast. Sétanta has a game to finish, but promises to follow the king later. But Conchobar forgets, and Culann lets loose his ferocious hound to protect his house. When Sétanta arrives, the enormous hound attacks him, but he kills it in self-defence, in one version by smashing it against a standing stone, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>another</b> by driving a sliotar (hurling ball) down its throat with his hurley. Culann is devastated {{by the loss of}} his hound, so Sétanta promises he will rear him a replacement, and until it is old enough to do the job, he himself will guard Culann's house. The druid Cathbad announces that his name henceforth will be Cú Chulainn—"Culann's Hound".|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in 1979 in Advances in the Study of Affect, vol. 5, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>another</b> article using the same data and published in 1980 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Michael D. Storms of the University of Kansas outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale. Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based on a combination of actual sexual behavior and fantasizing and eroticism, Storms used only fantasizing and eroticism. Storms, however, placed hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale; this allows for a distinction between bisexuality (exhibiting both hetero- and homo-eroticism in degrees comparable to hetero- or homosexuals, respectively) and asexuality (exhibiting a level of homo-eroticism comparable to a heterosexual and a level of hetero-eroticism comparable to a homosexual, namely, little to none). This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time. Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in sexual partners.|$|E

She was lightly damaged when she touched a rock while entering Brest in fog on 18 July <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>another</b> incident her steering compartment was flooded when a torpedo air flask burst between her screws during a torpedo-launching exercise on 18 May 1905. While visiting Portsmouth on 14 August Jauréguiberry ran aground for a short time in the outer harbour. She returned to the Mediterranean Fleet in February 1907 where she was assigned to the Reserve Division, and the following year was reassigned to the Third Division. In 1909 the 3rd and 4th Divisions were reformed into the 2nd Independent Squadron and transferred to the Atlantic in 1910. Beginning on 29 September 1910 her boiler tubes were renewed at Cherbourg. In October 1912 the Squadron was reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and a year later, in October 1913, Jauréguiberry {{was transferred to the}} Training Division of which she became the flagship in April 1914.|$|E
