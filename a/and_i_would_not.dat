However, in 2002 editor Simon Wright {{resigned}} as {{he believed that}} the managing director of The Automobile Association intervened to prevent Pétrus from receiving a fifth rosette at the recommendation of the AA's inspectors. Ramsay reacted by threatening to take legal action {{in order to ensure that}} none of his restaurants were featured in the 2003 edition of the AA's restaurant guide. This was followed by the resignation of inspector Sarah Peart over the same issue. The AA eventually relented and awarded Pétrus five rosettes. Wareing said of the issue at the time, [...] "I'm delighted to get the fifth rosette, it's a great achievement. Every AA inspector believed we deserved five rosettes, it was only the guy at the top, Roger Wood, who didn't. As far as I know, he still has not eaten at Pétrus <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> welcome him here now." ...|$|E

[...] In mid-May 1994 in Napa County, California, Gary Ramona won his lawsuit against his daughter's therapist and the psychiatrist who had given her sodium amytal. The psychiatrist claimed the drug helped Ramona's daughter remember specific details of sexual molestation by Ramona, but a court brief written by Martin Orne, a University of Pennsylvania psychiatrist who pioneered research of hypnosis and sodium amytal, stated that the drug is [...] "not useful in ascertaining 'truth' [...] [...] [...] The patient becomes sensitive and receptive to suggestions due to the context and to the comments of the interviewers." [...] This was the first successful legal challenge to the [...] "repressed memory phenomenon". Dr. Kenneth Gottlieb, a San Francisco psychiatrist said, [...] "It’s absolutely a psychiatric drug...I {{would never want to}} use a drug that tampers with a person’s unconscious unless there was no other drug available. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> use it without resuscitating equipment, in case of allergic reaction, and only with an M.D. anesthesiologist present." [...] According to Dr. John Yagiela, coordinator of the anesthesia and pain control department of UCLA’s school of dentistry, [...] "It’s unusual for it to be used [...] " [...] and [...] "better, safer alternatives are available." ...|$|E

She said: [...] "I used the word 'final solution' in a tweet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> in any way want to use that term and the inference other people lay on that.

She was skeptical in all cases for the sake of Swedish independence, as she feared that Sweden would {{become a part of the}} French Empire under Bernadotte, or the Russian Empire (as Peter of Holstein was married to a Russian), or an appendage to Denmark. During a meeting in the garden with Adlersparre, she stated: [...] "I am very happy to be Swedish <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> wish to be either French, Russian or Danish."

2500|$|In 1657, Cromwell {{was offered}} the crown by Parliament {{as part of a}} revised {{constitutional}} settlement, presenting him with a dilemma since he had been [...] "instrumental" [...] in abolishing the monarchy. Cromwell agonised for six weeks over the offer. He was attracted by the prospect of stability it held out, but in a speech on 13 April 1657 he made clear that God's providence had spoken against the office of king: “I would not seek to set up that which Providence hath destroyed and laid in the dust, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> build Jericho again”. The reference to Jericho harks back to a previous occasion on which Cromwell had wrestled with his conscience when the news reached England of the defeat of an expedition against the Spanish-held island of Hispaniola in the West Indies in 1655—comparing himself to Achan, who had brought the Israelites defeat after bringing plunder back to camp after the capture of Jericho.|$|E
2500|$|The Australian cricket team {{ended the}} 2005-06 season by touring Bangladesh in April 2006. The series {{was seen as}} an uneventful way to end the season as Australia, who were twenty points clear of second place in the ICC Test Championship, played a Bangladeshi team who had won one Test match in their cricketing history and were ranked at the bottom, over 100 points behind Australia. Bangladesh, however, wanted to refute {{comments}} made by the tourists' captain, Ricky Ponting who told London's Daily Telegraph in February [...] ""What I would not have is the minnow nations in the World Cup and the Champions Trophy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have Bangladesh and Zimbabwe playing Tests at present." [...] On arrival, Ponting pointed out, in support of the home side, that [...] "maybe Bangladesh having Test status will take the game forward". [...] On the back of a three-Test whitewash tour of South Africa, but a 3-2 loss in ODI matches (including the famous fifth ODI, in which Australia scored a world record of 4/434, only for South Africa to chase it down with a world record 9/438), Australia came to Bangladesh to play two Tests and three One-day International matches, without any warm-up touring matches.|$|E
2500|$|Ortmann is most {{remembered for}} his role in the famed 1950 Snow Bowl game against Ohio State, in which he punted 24 times in a {{blizzard}} for 723 yards – still a Michigan record. The weather conditions were so inclement that Michigan punted on first down for its first two plays from scrimmage, after concluding that the best strategy was to keep the slick ball on the other side of the field and in the hands of Ohio State. The strategy worked, as the game's only touchdown was scored after Ortman punted the ball out of bounds at the Ohio State six-yard line, Ohio State was forced to punt from deep in its own territory, and Tony Momsen recovered a blocked punt in the endzone. Ortmann recalled: “You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have gone outside to get the newspaper on a day like that. [...] But here we were, trying to play football.” Michigan did not get a first down and had only 27 yards of total offense, while Ortman was 0 for 8 passing and gained only 9 yards in 10 rushing attempts. The fierce weather conditions stifled both offenses, and the Wolverines managed to win 9-3 on a safety and Momsen's touchdown after the blocked punt. Interviewed about the Snow Bowl in 2006, Ortmann, then retired and living in Savannah, Georgia, recalled: [...] "Twice during the game, playing as the safety, I couldn't see [...] Vic Janowicz and his backfield, the snow was falling so heavily. Tony Momsen was our regular punter and as we were ready to go out, he said, ‘Charlie, I don't feel like punting today, you punt.' I hadn't punted in three months. But the hero of that game was not Chuck Ortmann, it was Carl Kreager, our center. I just put my hands down and the ball was always there. I still remind him every time we talk, 'Carl, you never got enough credit for that game.' It was so boring. I have a film of the game, and I haven't watched it since, if that tells you something." ...|$|E
