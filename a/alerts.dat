5|$|A {{major part}} of modern weather {{forecasting}} is the severe weather <b>alerts</b> and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected.

Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, high wind, flood, tropical cyclone, and fog. Severe weather advisories and <b>alerts</b> are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System, which break into regular programming.|$|E

5|$|On September22, about 3days {{before the}} system had formed into a {{tropical}} storm, its significant rainfall {{in the eastern}} Caribbean prompted flash flood warnings in Puerto Rico and the British Virgin Islands.

Evacuations began in vulnerable San Pedro de Macoris, La Romana, and Barahona and San Jose de Ocoa.

40|$|The study {{examined}} how <b>alerting</b> and executive attention interact in a task involving conflict resolution. We proposed a tentative {{scenario in which}} an initial exogenous phasic <b>alerting</b> phase is followed by an endogenous tonic <b>alerting</b> phase, and hypothesized that these two processes may have distinct effects on conflict resolution. Phasic <b>alerting</b> was expected to increase the conflict, whereas tonic <b>alerting</b> was expected to decrease the conflict. Three experiments were conducted using different variants of the flanker task with visual <b>alerting</b> cues and varied cue-target intervals (SOA), to differentiate between effects of phasic <b>alerting</b> (short SOA) and tonic <b>alerting</b> (long SOA). The results showed that phasic <b>alerting</b> consistently decreased the efficiency of conflict resolution indexed by response time and accuracy, whereas tonic <b>alerting</b> increased the accuracy of conflict resolution, but at a cost in the speed of processing the conflict. The third experiment additionally showed {{that the effects of}} phasic <b>alerting</b> may be modulated by the psychophysical strength of <b>alerting</b> cues. Discussed are possible mechanisms that could account for the observed interactions between <b>alerting</b> and conflict resolution, as well as some discrepancies between the current and previous studies...|$|R
