5|$|A highly active predator, {{the river}} otter has adapted to hunting in water, and eats aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The {{vulnerability}} <b>and</b> <b>seasonal</b> availability of prey animals mainly governs its food habits and prey choices. This availability {{is influenced by}} the following factors: detectability and mobility of the prey, habitat availability for the various prey species, environmental factors, such as water depth and temperature, <b>and</b> <b>seasonal</b> changes in prey supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} kingdom period, the palace {{controlled}} the economy, but wealthy families managed their financial affairs without government intervention. The economic system was redistributive; the palace distributed food to its permanent <b>and</b> <b>seasonal</b> workers. It {{is estimated that}} around 40,000 persons contributed to this system, but in general, and unlike in Mesopotamia, land stayed {{in the hands of}} villages, which paid an annual share to the palace. Agriculture was mainly pastoral; large herds of cattle were managed by the palace. The city's inhabitants owned around 140,000 head of sheep and goats, and 9,000 cattle.|$|E
5|$|Henry III of England {{granted a}} market to the Bishop of Ely using letters close on 9April 1224 {{although}} Ely {{had been a}} trading centre prior to this. Present weekly market days are Thursday and Saturday <b>and</b> <b>seasonal</b> markets are held monthly on Sundays and Bank Holiday Mondays from Easter to November. The city is situated on the River Great Ouse, which was a significant means of transport until the fens were drained and Ely ceased to be {{an island in the}} eighteenth century. The river is now a popular boating spot, and has a large marina.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, a {{total of}} 500 barrels were produced; this was {{forecast}} to grow to 1,000 barrels by 2009. In 2010, production {{was moved to the}} newly constructed William Worthington's Brewery, a microbrewery based at the National Brewery Centre in Burton. It also produces other Worthington beers such as Red Shield <b>and</b> <b>seasonal</b> beers. In 2012, increasing demand saw White Shield production moved to the main Coors brewery in Burton. In 2013, Roger Protz described White Shield as the highest selling bottle conditioned beer in Britain.|$|E

5|$|In several countries, {{fire safety}} {{officials}} encourage citizens {{to use the}} two annual clock shifts as reminders to replace batteries in smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, particularly in autumn, just before the heating and candle season causes an increase in home fires. Similar twice-yearly tasks include reviewing and practicing fire escape and family disaster plans, inspecting vehicle lights, checking storage areas for hazardous materials, reprogramming thermostats, <b>and</b> <b>seasonal</b> vaccinations. Locations without DST can instead use {{the first days of}} spring and autumn as reminders.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{apiculture}} {{has adopted}} simple breeding programs for uniform desired traits, <b>and</b> <b>seasonal</b> transportation of colonies over vast distances causes increased infectious exposures from mixing of these domestic and residual displaced wild populations. Brood incubation conditions may be stressful {{with respect to}} deficient nutrition, temperature and other basics. This combination of ecological factors, especially the host factor of loss of genetic variation and hybrid vigor, {{may account for the}} apparent multifactorial environmental 'causes' of CCD including concurrent infections.|$|E
5|$|LIDAR {{comprises}} firing lasers at relevant {{portions of}} the atmosphere where light is backscattered. By analyzing the reflected laser beam for Doppler shifts, wind speeds and wind directions in the target region may be calculated. The thermal structure, diurnal/semi-diurnal tides, <b>and</b> <b>seasonal</b> variations in the mesopause region may thus be studied. This is a valuable faculty for meteorologists and climatologists, as these properties can be significant.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs lack any shared {{traits that}} make them stand out from all other primates. Different types of lemurs have evolved unique {{combinations}} of unusual traits to cope with Madagascar's harsh, seasonal climate. These traits can include seasonal fat storage, hypometabolism (including torpor and hibernation), small group sizes, low encephalization (relative brain size), cathemerality (activity both day and night), and strict breeding seasons. Extreme resource limitations <b>and</b> <b>seasonal</b> breeding are also thought to {{have given rise to}} three other relatively common lemur traits: female social dominance, sexual monomorphism, and male–male competition for mates involving low levels of agonism, such as sperm competition.|$|E
5|$|One-day {{track and}} field {{meetings}} form the most common <b>and</b> <b>seasonal</b> aspect of the sport – {{they are the most}} basic level of {{track and field}} competition. Meetings are generally organised annually either under the patronage of an educational institution or sports club, or by a group or business that serves as the meeting promoter. In the case of the former, athletes are selected to represent their club or institution. In the case of privately run or independent meetings, athletes participate on an invitation-only basis.|$|E
5|$|Orographic or relief {{snowfall}} {{is caused}} when masses of air pushed by wind are forced {{up the side}} of elevated land formations, such as large mountains. The lifting of air {{up the side of}} a mountain or range results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier, warmer air on the descending, leeward side. The resulting enhanced productivity of snow fall and the decrease in temperature with elevation means that snow depth <b>and</b> <b>seasonal</b> persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow-prone areas.|$|E
50|$|Founders {{produces}} eight year-round beers <b>and</b> several <b>seasonal</b> <b>and</b> limited production beers. Throughout {{the course}} of the year, Founder's produces a large number of other beers that can be had at their Taproom and beer festivals.|$|R
