40|$|The Spiral 2 driver uses a slow chopper {{situated}} in the common section of the low energy beam transport line to change the beam intensity, {{to cut off the}} beam in case of critical loss and to avoid hitting the wheel structure of rotating targets. The device has to work up to 10 kV, 1 kHz repetition frequency rate and its design is based on standard power circuits, standard vacuum feed-through and custom <b>alarm</b> <b>board.</b> The paper summarizes the design principles and describes the test results of the final device, which has been installed on the beam line test bench. THE CHOPPER IN THE LEBT LINE The low energy beam transport (LEBT) line carries continuous wave (CW), high intensity beams of protons (5 mA), deuterons (5 mA) and ions (1 mA) with m/q= 3 from the sources to the radiofrequency quadruple. The source voltage for the three different particles are 20, 40 and 60 kV respectively, to match the RFQ input energy of 20 keV/A. The layout of the injector LEBT is shown in Fig. 1. The slow chopper [1] is placed just before the beam stop in the common section of the line. Figure 1 : The injector low energy lines and the slow chopper position. The proton/deuteron line section and the common one are presently installed at CEA Saclay to be tested before being installed in the SPIRAL 2 building. The slow chopper system was moved to Saclay in June 2011 and is going to be tested with the beam in the next few months. The device assembled on the line is shown in Fig. 2. The yellow arrow, in frame A, shows the beam direction. The beam stop and the micro channel plate are shown in frame B and the deflecting electrodes in frame C. REQUIREMENTS AND DESCRIPTION The chopper will be used to progressively increase the beam power during accelerator tuning, to avoid hitting th...|$|E

2500|$|The shuttle astronauts went {{to sleep}} as planned but were awakened {{by the sound of}} a master <b>alarm</b> on <b>board</b> Atlantis at 22:07 GMT. The tone {{signaled}} a failure with one of Atlantis's five IBM AP-101 General Purpose Computers (GPCs) No. 4. The alarm prompted Commander Ferguson to head to Atlantis and evaluate the issue. GPC-4 was running system management software at the time of failure. Ferguson with the help of Ground Control later transferred the failed GPC's programs onto GPC-2. The transfer took about 45 minutes, bypassing an expected period of loss of signal by utilizing communications at White Sands, New Mexico. After activating GPC-2 and with Atlantis in good shape, Ferguson and other crew members went back to sleep. [...] "You all have done an absolutely fabulous job. We have polled the room, everyone is ready for you to go back to sleep," [...] radioed CAPCOM Shannon Lucid from Mission Control.|$|R
2500|$|According to Anthony Cave Brown in Bodyguard of Lies, Haukelid {{concluded}} after a {{trial run}} that the explosives {{would be most}} effective if placed in the bow. If holed near the bow, the ship's screws and rudder would quickly be lifted out of the water, leaving the captain and crew without control. Haukelid also determined that [...] "he explosion had to be big enough to sink the ship, but not so severe as to cause casualties among the passengers and crew." [...] He carried the bomb, made from eighteen pounds of Nobel 808 plastic explosive and two fuses fashioned from <b>alarm</b> clocks, on <b>board</b> in an old sack.|$|R
5000|$|Dowd grew {{concerned}} when Osbon made comments such as [...] "We {{need to take}} a leap of faith", [...] "We're not going to Vegas", and [...] "I can't be held responsible when this plane crashes." [...] Osbon began giving what the first officer described as a sermon. Dowd tricked Osbon into going to the passenger compartment, then locked the cockpit door and changed the security code. Osbon railed at passengers about Jesus, Al-Qaeda, countries in the Middle East, and a possible bomb on <b>board.</b> <b>Alarmed</b> passengers tackled him and tied him up with seat belt extenders. An off duty JetBlue pilot who was travelling as a passenger joined Dowd in the cockpit and the plane landed about 20 minutes later. Osbon {{was arrested and charged with}} [...] "interference with a flight crew." ...|$|R

5000|$|Further criticisms {{were raised}} {{by some of the}} riders in the race itself that amateur rider, David Pitcher had been allowed to take part at all. Pitcher, who had only a few years riding {{experience}} had set off in an <b>alarming</b> manner on <b>board</b> his mount Brown Trix, diving the horse alarmingly at the third fence in particular. The criticism was heightened by the fact that Brown Trix was one of the two horses to suffer fatal falls. On viewing a playback of the race, Champion Jockey, Peter Scudamore was scathing in his criticism when he stated. [...] "I like David Pitcher. He's a nice man and as a person I've got a lot of time for him. But, in my view, he had no right to ride in the Grand National.... He's a bad tactician and, as far as I could see, he had no race plans. He just rode like a maniac down over those first three or four fences and, to me, that's not fearless. It's brainless. He rides a horse like he's swinging from the heels against west Indian fast-bowling." ...|$|R
50|$|As a side effect, {{that also}} meant that alarms were easy and cheap to {{configure}} and deploy. You simply typed in a location, a value to alarm on and set it to active. The unintended result was that soon people alarmed everything. Initial installers set an alarm at 80% and 20% of the operating range of any variable just as a habit. The integration of programmable logic controllers, safety instrumented systems, and packaged equipment controllers {{has been accompanied by}} an overwhelming increase in associated alarms. One other unfortunate part of the digital revolution was that what once covered several square yards of real estate, now had to be fit into a 17 inch computer monitor. Multiple pages of information was thus employed to replicate the information on the replaced panel <b>board.</b> <b>Alarms</b> were utilised to tell an operator to go look at a page he was not viewing. Alarms were used to tell an operator that a tank was filling. Every mistake made in operations usually resulted in a new alarm. With the implementation of the OSHA 1910 regulations, HAZOPS studies usually requested several new alarms. Alarms were everywhere. Incidents began to accrue as a combination of too much data collided with too little useful information.|$|R
60|$|He was, however, soon aroused {{from his}} stupor by an <b>alarm</b> raised on <b>board</b> his galley {{that they were}} pursued. He rose from his seat, seized a spear, and, on {{ascending}} to the quarter-deck, saw {{that there were a}} number of small light boats, full of men and of arms, coming up behind them, and gaining rapidly upon his galley. Antony, now free for a moment from his enchantress's sway, and acting under the impulse of his own indomitable boldness and decision, instead of urging the oarsmen to press forward more rapidly in order to make good their escape, ordered the helm to be put about, and thus, turning the galley around, he faced his pursuers, and drove his ship into the midst of them. A violent conflict ensued, the din and confusion of which was increased by the shocks and collisions between the boats and the galley. In the end, the boats were beaten off, all excepting one: that one kept still hovering near, and the commander of it, who stood upon the deck, poising his spear with an aim at Antony, and seeking eagerly an opportunity to throw it, seemed by his attitude and the expression of his countenance to be animated by some peculiarly bitter feeling of hostility and hate. Antony asked him who he was, that dared so fiercely to threaten him. The man replied by giving his name, and saying that he came to avenge the death of his father. It proved that he was the son of a man whom Antony had at a previous time, on some account or other, caused to be beheaded.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2007, they {{announced}} that thirteen demos {{had already been}} recorded for a new album, which would be titled Under the Boards. It was also revealed {{that this would be}} the second of a three-part concept involving Sound the <b>Alarm,</b> Under the <b>Boards</b> and the yet to be released Daybreak. Chris Conley said that [...] "Sound the Alarm is an expression of discontent. Under the Boards is reflection and remorse. Daybreak is acceptance."Conley also said about the three-album concept: [...] "The whole trilogy was just a bit of a therapeutic experiment. I felt like all twisted up and broken inside and just angry and confused and depressed and sad and I couldn’t really deal with the world or myself. So I was just like ′this has got to end, I have to at least try and get a grip on the world and on myself′. So I dove into the depths of my mind and brought out what I was finding, so the first album was filled with all the anger, the surface pain, and all the paranoid delusional thoughts that were there. The second album, Under the Boards, dealt with how all of that was making my life unbearable, and I realized I had to change, so that album was the transitional part, starting to transition out of that dark place, because you realize how its affecting your life. So Daybreak is coming to terms with everything and trying to understand why I actually got that way and learning to accept it by exploring what it is and why it was there and simultaneously trying to grow through it and be a better person, not purely full of anger." ...|$|R
60|$|The Indians in {{the canoe}} {{appeared}} to have no fear of the Spaniards, and readily went alongside of the admiral's caravel. Columbus was overjoyed at thus having brought to him at once, without trouble or danger, a collection of specimens of all the important articles {{of this part of}} the New World. He examined, with great curiosity and interest, the contents of the canoe. Among various utensils and weapons similar to those already found among the natives, he perceived others of a much superior kind. There were hatchets for cutting wood, formed not of stone but copper; wooden swords, with channels {{on each side of the}} blade, in which sharp flints were firmly fixed by cords made of the intestines of fishes; being the same kind of weapon afterwards found among the Mexicans. There were copper bells and other articles of the same metal, together with a rude kind of crucible in which to melt it; various vessels and utensils neatly formed of clay, of marble, and of hard wood; sheets and mantles of cotton, worked and dyed with various colors; great quantities of cacao, a fruit as yet unknown to the Spaniards, but which, as they soon found, the natives held in great estimation, using it both as food and money. There was a beverage also extracted from maize or Indian corn, resembling beer. Their provisions consisted of bread made of maize, and roots of various kinds, similar to those of Hispaniola. From among these articles, Columbus collected such as were important to send as specimens to Spain, giving the natives European trinkets in exchange, with which they were highly satisfied. They appeared to manifest neither astonishment nor <b>alarm</b> when on <b>board</b> of the vessels, and surrounded by people who must have been so strange and wonderful to them. The women wore mantles, with which they wrapped themselves, like the female Moors of Granada, and the men had cloths of cotton round their loins. Both sexes appeared more particular about these coverings, and to have a quicker sense of personal modesty than any Indians Columbus had yet discovered.|$|R
40|$|All {{public places}} closed and all {{meetings}} are prohibited. Some early morning Catholic masses {{will be held}} this morning because the order does not take effect until 11 AM. The length of the closures {{will be determined by}} whether the situation improves or not within the city. Estimated to be in effect for two weeks. • The Denver board of health admits that “the epidemic now threatens to assume <b>alarming</b> proportions. ”• <b>Board</b> of health will inspect all workplaces/factories that employee many workers immediately. Sick workers will be sent home. Workplaces that cannot be properly ventilated will be closed. • Shoppers and those who patronize restaurants are asked not to linger. Don’t make unnecessary visits to stores. • Public is encouraged to spend as much time outside as possible and to get plenty of fresh air. Parents should let children out of doors as much as possible but discourage “the gathering of children for the purpose of amusement. ”• All groupings of people are considered dangerous, even those between 2 – 3 people. This is particularly true if one or more persons are ill. • Liberty loan meetings will be held outside. (Ad: “Spanish Flu can’t stop the Liberty Loan drive—it didn’t stop the boys at the front. Don’t let it stop you—buy bonds at once. ”) • Influenza appears to be hitting young people, between 25 - 30, who are otherwise in good health. • No tuberculosis patients have been recorded as also suffering from influenza. This is surprising because, as Dr. Sharpley comments, those with respiratory diseases should be susceptible to influenza, especially because they cannot ward off disease as well as a healthy person. • At prompting of Catholic priest, the health board will consider funding a mobile volunteer nursing service for those who cannot afford healthcare. • If the epidemic gets worse, there will be a serious nursing shortage. Already many nurses are serving the war effort or are sick themselves. A call for nurses will go out soon, {{with the assistance of the}} Red Cross. Any women who have enough nursing training to allow them to take care of an influenza patient are encouraged to offer their services. • The epidemic has hit so fast that the supply of oxygen—a final treatment for pneumonia—is running low. Colorado Springs asked for oxygen supplies from Denver and had to be refused. • Dr. H. L. Taylor estimates that “unless drastic measures [are] taken at once” approximately 10, 000 to 15, 000 cases will appear within the next week in Denver. • “The germ which causes the Spanish influenza is declared by the physicians to be a short-lived one, and it is believed that the measures taken last night will effectively halt the progress of the epidemic. ”• Quarantine placed on Fort Logan. No soldiers are allowed to leave the fort grounds until further notice. There are no influenza cases yet; this is a preventative measure. • Businessmen and church personnel support the closures because they believe it will help limit the epidemic’s impact. • “H. E. Elison, speaking for the motion picture theaters, said that altho [sic] the closing of their houses would practically spell ruin to their business, the theater men considered the saving of lives paramount and would cheerfully abide by the decision of the health officers. ”• Notice that any events or meetings advertised in today’s paper that went to print before the closure are all cancelled due to closure order. • Dr. Sharpley requests that Denver residents do not burn leaves. The smoke caused by leaf burning is hazardous to health no matter what and contributes to the development of colds. Therefore, since an epidemic is building, whose symptoms closely resemble a common cold at first, leaf burning is especially dangerous. Newspaper article 1,...|$|R
