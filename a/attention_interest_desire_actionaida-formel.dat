50|$|As {{mentioned}} in his paper, Wijaya put special attention on concept of AIDA (<b>Attention,</b> <b>Interest,</b> <b>Desire,</b> Action) model, considering {{this model is}} the most popular, widely used in studies to measure the effect of advertising, as well as inspiring the birth of new hierarchy of effect models. Barry & Howard (1990: 101) stated that so important was the AIDA formulation {{at the turn of}} the century that Strong (1925) estimated that 90 per cent of persons engaged in selling and the vast majority of advertising and selling textbooks fully endorsed the Lewis-Sheldon hierarchical framework. In addition, the development of information technology has radically changed the way of how people communicate and socialize; as well as a paradigm shift from product-oriented marketing to consumer-oriented marketing or people-oriented marketing. These developments eventually change our perspective in viewing advertising effects. The advertising effects are no longer as simple as <b>Attention,</b> <b>Interest,</b> <b>Desire</b> and Action or added with Satisfaction as developed by Strong (1925). This is due to more critical public or potential customers who can no longer be dictated to by advertising information. The advertisement may be interesting, but not enticing enough to create a passion to purchase the advertised product. Therefore, the variables in the hierarchy of effects model needs to be updated in response to the latest developments in the respect of the public power as a consumer audience.|$|R

Traditional media advertisers followed {{a model that}} suggested consumers went through a linear process they called AIDA - <b>Attention,</b> <b>Interest,</b> <b>Desire</b> and Action. <b>Attention</b> is therefore a major and the first stage {{in the process of}} converting non-consumers. Since the cost to transmit advertising to consumers is now sufficiently low that more ads can be transmitted to a consumer (e.g. via online advertising) than the consumer can process, the consumer's attention becomes the scarce resource to be allocated. Dolgin also states that a superfluidity of information may hinder the decision making of an individual who keeps searching and comparing products as long as it promises to provide more than it is using up.|$|R

The AIDA model {{is widely used}} in {{marketing}} and advertising to describe the steps or stages that occur from the time when a consumer first becomes aware of a product or brand through to when the consumer trials a product or makes a purchase decision.

In essence, the AIDA model proposes that advertising messages need to accomplish a number of tasks {{in order to move}} the consumer through a series of sequential steps from brand awareness through to action (purchase and consumption). The AIDA model is one of the longest serving models used in advertising, having been developed in the late nineteenth century.

Using MOOCs as a marketing platform shows promise; but for this to succeed, {{it is necessary to}} understand the motivations of those who undertake them and to demonstrate how these same motivations can be better satisfied through enrolment in a fee-paying university course. We discuss the motivations for students as they progress through a MOOC and the factors that might lead to subsequent university enrolment. Our arguments are informed by MOOC statistics, the AIDA (<b>attention,</b> <b>interest,</b> <b>desire,</b> action) marketing model, and the literature on adult education, technology adoption, goal seeking and consumer value. We argue that most students are led to MOOC enrolment through close alignment of the course topic and subject matter with their personal goals and through the establishment of an attractive value proposition. Progress in the MOOC depends on whether this goal alignment is maintained, and whether the value assumptions of students are met or exceeded. We predict that subsequent university enrolment will most likely occur when the MOOC experience is both satisfying and representative of the university experience, and where the increased time and financial commitment demanded by formal study is offset by the greater likelihood of attaining the focal goal. For this strategy to succeed, it will be necessary for the host institution to actively work with MOOC students to create an awareness of appropriate fee-paying courses and to promote the benefits of university study. This has implications for the way institutions market their courses to MOOC students...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{potential}} use of the Hierarchy of Effects-type approach in SME marketing communications on social media. Prior Work: AIDA (<b>Attention,</b> <b>Interest,</b> <b>Desire</b> and Action) has been considered for many years as part of the development of SME marketing communications strategy. Since SMEs generally do not have big budgets they usually focus on producing content that can get a message across inexpensively and seek to do this in the most effective way possible. The AIDA ‘sales funnel’ is a marketing technique that is based on achieving specific objectives at each of the AIDA stages. In recent times marketing communications and especially advertising have seen profound change, especially in the way people communicate, socialise and engage with electronic word-of-mouth (e-WOM). In social media marketing terms it is important that the message makes the audience aware and grabs attention while content should create interest in such a way as to automatically create desire and lead to action which is often purchase. This process can utilize many tools such as video or some other digital resource that might, for example, educate or attempt to change attitudes.

I write from a European perspective, drawing largely on European and American publications. The AIDA formula well sums up the purposes of commercial advertising, and is said to consist of attracting <b>Attention,</b> arousing <b>Interest,</b> creating <b>Desire,</b> and motivating Action. In commercial advertising the desired action is the sale of a product or service. This calls for strategies of persuasion, which can be described rhetorically or thematically. I prefer the thematic approach, and have decided that least following strategies will be discovered: recognition and surprise, riddle and puzzle, wit and humour, patriotism, famous persons, myth, ethnicity, Bible and Christian tradition, and nature, environment and ecology. These are not listed hierarchically and a given ad may employ several of these strategies. KEYWORDS: Emblems; Advertising; Advertising Strategies...|$|R

50|$|The way {{in which}} a {{consumer}} communicates with their peers is called personal communication (Businessdictionary.com n.d.); {{from the perspective of the}} consumer, in regards to acquiring, consuming and disposing behaviour, this is the most credible source of information (Dahlen et al., 2010). For this reason, mind shapers, social influence in particular, hold a strong association with what a consumer is interested in and thusly, what a consumer desires. Social influence is pivotal to the offerings a consumer desires because as human beings, consumers are social creatures and have social needs (Hoyer et al., 2012). This idea is espoused in Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs (as cited in Hoyer et al., 2012) in the psychological social level of needs; here it is asserted by Maslow (cited in Hoyer et al., 2012) that all humans have a psychological social need for relationships, acceptance and love. Consumers seek to satiate this need by acquiring offerings that are in line with what their peers consider socially acceptable (Hoyer et al., 2012). Ergo, it is in line with this need to fit in that marketers seek to catch consumers’ <b>attention,</b> <b>interest</b> and <b>desire</b> through marketing messages that offer one liners such as “join the club!” and “don’t miss out” (Marcom Projects, 2007). Although social needs are not the only human need satisfied by acquiring and consuming market offerings, from here it is conceivable that consumers desire offerings, advertised in marketing messages as a means to satisfy their social need for love and acceptance. It can also be gleaned that this need to fit in can also be considered as a fear: Put forward in Effie Worldwide (2015), a fear of missing out on what others do or own is also known in the marketing industry as FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). This concept is also a social influence that shapes consumers’ minds and rationalises desire.|$|R
