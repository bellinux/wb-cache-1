5|$|An {{individual}} organism's phenotype {{results from}} both its genotype {{and the influence}} from the environment it has lived in. <b>A</b> <b>substantial</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation. The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative {{to other forms of}} that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of fixation—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.|$|E
