40|$|AbstractPreviously, Vp 130, a chloroviral {{structural}} protein, {{was found}} to have host-cell-wall-binding activity for NC 64 <b>A-viruses</b> (PBCV- 1 and CVK 2). In this study, we have isolated and characterized the corresponding protein from chlorovirus CVGW 1, one of Pbi-viruses that have a different host range. In NC 64 <b>A-viruses,</b> Vp 130 consists of a highly conserved N-terminal domain, internal repeats of 70 – 73 aa motifs and a C-terminal domain occupied by 23 – 26 tandem repeats of a PAPK motif. However, CVGW 1 {{was found to}} have a slightly different Vp 130 construction where the PAPK repeats were not in the C-terminus but internal. Immunofluorescence microscopy with a specific antibody revealed that the C-terminal region containing the Vp 130 repetitive motifs from PBCV- 1 and CVK 2 was responsible for binding to Chlorella cell walls. Furthermore, by immunoelectron microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy, Vp 130 was localized at a unique vertex of the chlorovirus particle and was found to be masked through binding to the host cells. These results suggested that Vp 130 is localized at a unique vertex on the virion, with the C-terminal repetitive units outside for cell wall binding...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{determining}} the contamination of pacific rock oysters from different origins with relevant bacterial and viral organisms. For that purpose, oyster samples were taken regularly between March 2005 and July 2006 from different European origins (France, Netherlands, Ireland and Germany). A total of 477 samples were analysed for norovirus and of 372 samples for HAV. In addition 25 g sample material from every charge was {{tested for the}} bacterial contamination. The analysis included the compulsory microbiological parameters Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. {{as well as the}} determination of the total bacterial count and of the contamination with Lactobacillus, Lactic Bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. Aeromonas spp. coagulasepositive Staphylococci, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Enterobactericeae, Enterococci, Coliforms, Moulds and Yeasts. The results of this study show that in the investigated samples norovirus and HAV could not be detected. The same applies to Salmonella, E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Only 13 % of the samples showed an increased total aerobic bacterial count, with further 13 % had elevated levels of Enterobacteriaceae. Three of the samples (7 %) showed increased levels of Pseudomonas spp. and Aeromonas spp. For the interpretation of the results {{it is important to recognize}} that all samples were collected at a local wholesaler. Recontamination through sale and kitchen staff plays next to the pollution caused by abiotic vectors, such as customer goods, the largest role in the transmission of the virus. The examination of retail samples is probably more significant. Due to the low prevalence of noroviruses and Hepatitis <b>A-viruses</b> at the time of delivery, other points in the chain, from oystersfarm to oysterbar, seems to be more appropriate for a monitoring. The conventional RT-PCR system with MON-primers is suitable to investigate food samples for noroviruses. In the Real-Time PCR sensitive primer-probe combinations for the detection of Genogroup I noroviruses were missing. The GG II system has to be improved further due to the great heterogeneity within the noroviruses, although it showed a good sensitivity. The artus HAV LC RT-PCR Kit® is currently the only commercially available system for the detection of HAV through the Real Time PCR. It has a very good sensitivity and the handling is very easy and straightforward...|$|E
40|$|One type of {{gene therapy}} of tumors, gene-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy (GDEPT), holds {{considerable}} promise, although practical considerations limit its clinical applicability. These in-clude {{the lack of}} acceptable noninvasive methods that are adaptable to humans for selective tumor targeting of the thera-peutic genetic material. Sindbis virus is an oncolytic, <b>a-virus</b> that selectively targets tumors through the 67 -kDa laminin recep-tor (LAMR). In this report we describe a novel approach that permits tumor-selective tumor targeting and quantitative in vivo monitoring using PET of a commonly applied GDEPT, based on herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase type 1 (HSVtk) and ganciclovir (GCV). Methods: Sindbis/tk vectors were harvested from the supernatant of in vitro cultures of a packaging cell pro-duced by electroporation of both replicon RNA (SinRep 5 /tk) and helper RNA (DH-BB) into baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells.

50|$|Rebecca {{recognizes the}} zombies {{loyalty to the}} host and makes a {{connection}} to Las Plagas, the bioweapon used by the Los Illuminados, and theorizes that the remaining members of the cult are providing information to Arias in developing the <b>A-Virus.</b> Both identify {{the need for an}} expert on the matter and make contact with DSO agent Leon S. Kennedy in Colorado. But Leon, drinking his sorrows away, is hesitant to join their mission after his fellow officers were ambushed and turned into zombies from receiving poor intel about Los Illuminados. Chris and Rebecca try to get Leon on board the mission, but the trio are soon attacked by Maria and Diego. They succeed in capturing Rebecca, while Chris and Leon, finally agreeing to help, team up to plan a rescue operation and decrypt Arias' plan of a large-scale attack on New York City.|$|R
5000|$|In Resident Evil: Vendetta, Rebecca (long {{retired as}} a police officer) is working in her laboratory, using her {{knowledge}} of medicine to develop possible cures for viruses, successfully reaching a breakthrough with a vaccine. The building is suddenly attacked by a woman called Maria, and Rebecca is exposed to the new <b>A-Virus</b> via gas, but uses the vaccine to save her life, while the gas turns her colleagues into zombies. Rebecca is rescued by Chris and the BSAA, and Rebecca reveals she let others know about her work, which lead to the bad guys attempting to assassinate her because of her expertise. They {{come to the conclusion}} that the surviving members of Los Illuminados (related to the hostiles in Resident Evil 4) are somehow involved with a man named Glenn Arias who Chris has a grudge against, due to the deaths of his informant, Kathy White, her son, Zack, and his fellow agents, who infiltrated Arias' hideout, only to be wiped out.|$|R
40|$|Foxp 3 + CD 4 + {{regulatory}} T cells {{represent a}} T cell subset with well-characterized immunosuppressive effects during immune homeostasis and chronic infections, {{and there is}} emerging evidence to suggest these cells temper pulmonary inflammation in response to acute viral infection. Recent studies have demonstrated treatment with PC 61 CD 25 -depleting antibody potentiates inflammation in a murine model of RSV infection, while paradoxically delaying recruitment of CD 8 + T cells {{to the site of}} inflammation. The present study therefore sought to examine the role of these cells in a murine model of acute influenza A virus infection through the administration of PC 61 CD 25 -depleting antibody. PC 61 antibody is able to partially deplete CD 25 +Foxp 3 + regulatory T cells to a comparable degree as seen within previous work examining RSV, however this does not alter influenza <b>A-virus</b> induced mortality, weight loss, viral clearance and cellularity within the lung. Collectively, these data demonstrate that partial depletion of CD 4 +CD 25 + regulatory T cells with PC 61 antibody does not alter the course of influenza A virus infection...|$|R
40|$|Cytotoxic T cell (To) 1 lysis of {{influenza}} virus-infected target cells is restricted {{by the major}} histocompatibility locus and requires the presence of viral antigen on the infected cell surface (1, 2). A major characteristic of the T ¢ response to influenza viruses in both mouse and man is its cross-reactivity with serologically distinct type-A strains (3 - 5). It {{has been suggested that}} viral matrix (M) -protein, which is indistinguishable between different type-A viruses, could be responsible for recognition by cross-reactive T~. This antigen was detected on the surface of infected cells by sera from animals hyperimmunized with purified M-protein (6, 7); the assertion from quantitative studies (8) was that M-protein constituted a high proportion of the viral antigens expressed on abortively infected (P 815 mastocytoma) cells. Because these findings were based upon the use of heterogenous antisera, which reacted with M-protein, but the specificity of which was not rigorously determined, we have selected a hybridoma that secretes monoclonal antibody to <b>A-virus</b> M-protein for quantitation of M-protein on infected cells. In our initial experiments (9) we found that M-protein could be detected on the surface of infected cells, but only in very low amounts; i. e. ...|$|R
50|$|Arias {{intends to}} make Rebecca his bride as she shares a {{striking}} resemblance to his late wife. It is also revealed here that Diego and Maria are father and daughter, and close friends of Arias who also survived the wedding massacre. He develops a new strain of the <b>A-Virus</b> that is not affected by the vaccine and injects it into Rebecca. Arias then challenges Chris to rescue Rebecca within twenty minutes, after which the virus will take full effect on Rebecca. As Arias' associates initiate their attack on New York City by releasing the gas form of the virus via tankers, Leon and Chris' new BSAA team - DC, Damian, and Nadia - manage to destroy the vehicles, contain the virus and defeat Maria, although Damian is brutally decapitated by zombie dogs in the process. Chris then infiltrates Arias' safe house, defeats Diego and rescues Rebecca. On the terrace, he is confronted by Arias, and a brutal gun-kata and Close Quarters fight ends with Arias falling through the glass terrace below to his demise. Diego then arrives and, despite being badly injured after being defeated by Chris, merges with Arias to form a new Tyrant monster. Chris is no match against the Arias-tyrant until Leon joins the fight after working his way through the safehouse, mowing down zombies. With the assistance of DC and Nadia, they manage to trap the Tyrant, at which point Chris finishes it off with a grenade launcher. They are then able to locate the antidote that Arias kept and cure Rebecca just before the twenty minutes run out before escaping by helicopter, wondering what may lie ahead.|$|R
40|$|Sinds het seizoen 1992 / 93 sturen de NIVEL (Nederlands Instituut voor Onderzoek van de Gezondheidszorg) peilstationartsen neus-/keelwatten op van door hen behandelde patienten met acute luchtwegklachten naar het RIVM. Aldaar worden deze monsters m. b. v. de kweek in celcultuur op virussen onderzocht. In het seizoen 1994 / 95 werden de monsters tevens m. b. v. de {{polymerase}} chain reactie (PCR) onderzocht op Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, rhinovirus, enterovirus, RS-virus, coronavirus OC 43 en coronavirus 229 E. Deze surveillance verschaft een beter inzicht in de etiologie en de incidenties van minder ernstig verlopende luchtweginfecties dan de virusisoleringen voor diagnostische doeleinden. In het seizoen 1994 / 95 stuurden de peilstationartsen 557 monsters van patienten met respiratoire aandoeningen naar het RIVM. In 189 (34 %) werd een respiratoir virus en/of bacterie aangetoond. Influenza B-virus (9 %) en rhinovirus (9 %) waren de meest voorkomende verwekkers gevolgd door coronavirus OC 43 (4 %), influenza <b>A-virus</b> (3 %), RS-virus (3 %) en adenovirus (2 %). In 8 (4 %) van de positieve monsters werden twee verwekkers aangetoond. In 70 (37 %) van de positieve monsters werd alleen m. b. v. de PCR een micro-organisme aangetoond. Worden deze resultaten vergeleken met die uit de diagnostische laboratoria, dan zijn de belangrijkste verschillen het relatief hogere aantal influenzavirus-isolaten en het relatief lagere aantal RS-virus-isolaten in het NIVEL/RIVM-surveillance netwerk. Tevens is influenza B-virus de meest voorkomende verwekker in het NIVEL/RIVM-surveillance netwerk in tegenstelling tot de diagnostische laboratoria, waar het type A(H 3 N 2) domineerde. Van 68 PCR-positieve patienten werden 72 vervolgmonsters afgenomen na gemiddeld 24 dagen. Drie patienten bleken PCR-positief te blijven voor hetzelfde agens; in twee gevallen betrof het Chlamydia pneumoniae. De klinische relevantie van de PCR lijkt daarom goed te zijn voor de onderzochte respiratoire virussen en voor Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The Netherlands {{institute of}} {{primary health care}} (NIVEL) is running a surveillance network of 46 sentinel general practices (GP) stations, spread over the country {{in proportion to the}} population density. The GP of this network sent nose/throat swabs from the part of their patients with respiratory illnesses to the RIVM. In the season 1994 / 95 557 respiratory specimens were examined by virus isolation and PCR. In 189 (34 %) of the samples a respiratory virus or bacterium was detected by either technique. Influenza B (9 %) and rhinovirus (9 %) were the predominant viruses followed by coronavirus OC 43 (4 %), influenza A virus (3 %), RS virus (3 %), and adenovirus (2 %). In 8 (4 %) of the positive samples two etiologic agents were detected. In 70 (37 %) of the causative agents were only recognized by PCR. When comparing the results of the surveillance among patients in the GP network with those of the examinations of virus diagnostic laboratories, the main differences were the higher proportion of influenza virus isolations and the lower proportion of RS virus isolations in the GP system. Among the isolated influenza viruses, type B prevailed in the GP system and type A(H 3 N 2) in the virus diagnostic laboratories. From 68 PCR-positive patients 72 follow-up samples could be obtained, taken on an average 24 days after the first specimen. In only three patients the agent could still be demonstrated in the follow-up sample; in two of these the agent was Chlamydia pneumoniae. Conclusions: The proportions of {{at least part of the}} viruses isolated from patients with respiratory complaints in a GP network differ considerably from those isolated in virus diagnostic laboratories, the samples of which are mainly derived from hospitalised patients. Surveillance of respiratory infections among patients of GP is therefore essential for the insight in the epidemiology of respiratory diseases. On the average, illness from infection with influenza B-virus appears to be less severe compared to influenza A(H 3 N 2) virus. Application of the PCR-technique enhances considerably the rate of positive results of the examination of respiratory specimens. Important respiratory pathogens as coronavirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae even can only be detected by PCR. The clinical relevance of the PCR-technique appears to be high for the tested respiratory viruses and for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The rhinovirus PCR and the virus culture technique should be improved, whereas the bacterial surveillance should be extended to important cultivable respiratory bacteria...|$|R
