40|$|ABSTRACT The {{operation}} of an anaerobic digester on the poultry farm can generate multiple benefits {{in addition to}} its basic function for the treatment of animal waste. It generates biogas, which is a combustible fuel. The residue after digestion can be recovered as a solid by-product which has nutritional value as a feed supplement. The digestion process, especially at the thermophilic temperature, can destroy excreta-born pathogens and therefore protect environmental health. The liquid effluent with its nutrient content can support fish growth. With a simple and low cost anaerobic digester system that has been developed at North Carolina State University laboratories and poultry farm, the integrated operation may be economical.

40|$|Abstract. Studies on ant {{communities}} of India are sparse and needed. This {{is the first}} comprehensive survey of ant communities from the Vadodara district located in {{the central part of}} Gujarat, India (west coast of the Indian Peninsula). The present study was undertaken to (i) assess ant diversity and density changes along a habitat gradient and (ii) establish the species composition of ant communities in urban and <b>agricultural</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Study sites comprised (a) <b>agricultural</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> which included fields of cotton, castor, tobacco and some vegetable crops, and (b) urban ecosystems, which included the community gardens of Vadodara. Pitfall traps and hand collection methods were used for collecting ants. Twenty-two ant species from 13 genera and five subfamilies were collected. Ants of nine genera and 15 species were found in urban ecosystems, and ten genera and 16 species in agricultural ecosystems; rarefaction curves indicated these totals to be complete for the detectable ant fauna. Pheidole showed greatest species richness in urban ecosystems, whereas Camponotus and Pheidole were equally speciose in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Results indicate that the composition of ant species is unique to each habitat, and most likely governed by the vegetation and the other biota around it...|$|R
40|$|<b>Agricultural</b> <b>ecosystems</b> {{provide a}} range of {{benefits}} that are vital to human well-being. These benefits are dependent on several soil functions that are affected in different ways by legislation from the European Union, national, and regional levels. We evaluated current European Union soil-related legislation and examples of regional legislation with regard to direct and indirect impacts on five soil functions: the production of food, fiber, and fuel; water purification and regulation; carbon sequestration and climate regulation; habitat for biodiversity provisioning; and the recycling of nutrients/agro-chemicals. Our results illustrate the diversity of existing policies and the complex interactions present between different spatial and temporal scales. The impact of most policies, positive or negative, on a soil function is usually not established, but depends on how the policy is implemented by local authorities and the farmers. This {{makes it difficult to}} estimate the overall state and trends of the different soil functions in <b>agricultural</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> To implement functional management and sustainable use of the different soil functions in <b>agricultural</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> more knowledge is needed on the policy interactions {{as well as on the}} impact of management options on the different soil function...|$|R
40|$|This review {{analyzes}} the potential role and {{long-term effects of}} field perennial polycultures (mixtures) in agricultural systems, {{with the aim of}} reducing the trade-offs between provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. First, crop rotations are identified as a suitable tool for the assessment of the long-term effects of perennial polycultures on ecosystem services, which are not visible at the single-crop level. Second, the ability of perennial polycultures to support ecosystem services when used in crop rotations is quantified through eight <b>agricultural</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services. Legume–grass mixtures and wildflower mixtures are used as examples of perennial polycultures, and compared with silage maize as a typical crop for biomass production. Perennial polycultures enhance soil fertility, soil protection, climate regulation, pollination, pest and weed control, and landscape aesthetics compared with maize. They also score lower for biomass production compared with maize, which confirms the trade-off between provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. However, the additional positive factors provided by perennial polycultures, such as reduced costs for mineral fertilizer, pesticides, and soil tillage, and a significant preceding crop effect that increases the yields of subsequent crops, should be taken into account. However, a full assessment of <b>agricultural</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services requires a more holistic analysis that is beyond the capabilities of current frameworks...|$|E
30|$|International {{research}} and studies {{across the world}} by different agencies are also building up the argument that agriculture has to adopt sustainable methods by following {{the basic principles of}} bringing back life to soil through integrated agro ecological agricultural practices (IAASTD 2009; Third World Network 2012, and UNCTAD 2013). Several research reports from across the world indeed argue for small scale diversified and integrated methods of agriculture.

In other words, ‘economies of scope’ rather than ‘economies of scale’ is indeed the science of efficiency and sustainable production at the primary food production level. The perspective of ‘systems thinking’ rather than the perspective of ‘linear thinking’ can explain these dynamics of production in nature.|$|E

40|$|<b>Agricultural</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are {{vulnerable}} to biological invasions. There are a total of 239 invasive alien species {{in a variety of}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>ecosystems</b> in China. Among them, 155 species are plants, 55 are animals and 29 are microbes. The number of invasive alien species decreases from south to north, and from east to west in China. Invasive alien plant species are generally introduced intentionally, while animals and microbes are mainly unintentionally introduced. Among these invaders, 45. 04 % have a geographical origin in the Americas, 22. 90 % in Europe, and 16. 41 % in Asia. Of these species, 64. 85 % and 66. 53 % occur in vegetable gardens (including greenhouses) and orchards, respectively, while 34. 31 %, 23. 85 % and 6. 28 % occur in summer-harvested crop dry land, autumn-harvested crop dry land and paddy field, respectively. Among these 239 invaders, 17 plant species, 10 animals and 7 microbes are noxious pests which, we feel, deserve closer management attention. Currently, chemical control is the principal approach to managing these species in <b>agricultural</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> However, long-term application of pesticides has led to pesticide resistance in some invasive species, with 51 of the 239 invasive alien species reported as exhibiting pesticide-resistant populations worldwide. Therefore, more attention should be paid to management which integrates biological control,ecological measures, agronomic means and quarantine. We suggest that research into the following issues would be fruitful: patterns and mechanisms of and trends in biological invasions in <b>agricultural</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> origin sources and invasion pathways, influences of biological invasions and pesticide resistance on successions of pest communities, and biological invasions caused by transgenic crops...|$|R
