5|$|A new wooden {{northern}} jetty {{was added}} in 1872 which allowed {{the removal of}} the original western landing place. Another jetty was built on the south west corner in 1898 which reached deep water even at low tide, thus allowing steamers to use the pier at all states of the tide. This was damaged in a gale in 1903, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> it was rebuilt in 1909, it closed in 1916 and was dismantled in 1923. The northern jetty had also been damaged in the 1903 storm but was replaced by the present steel structure in 1905.|$|E

Due to the discriminatory laws in force at the time, Saunders had fewer rights as a citizen than the white Australians he led.

On 30 September, observers, including Finlay and E. E. Barnard, began to notice that the comet's nucleus was elongated and broken into two pronounced bright balls of light, and by 17 October it was clear that it had broken into at least five fragments. Observers reported that the relative brightness of the fragments varied from day to day.|$|E
5|$|After {{suffering}} a foot injury {{at the start}} of 1986–87, Gibbs was restricted to 18 appearances as his team finished the season 9th in the First Division. However, the departure of Graham Taylor and arrival of Dave Bassett the following season signalled a decline in the club's fortunes. Gibbs lost his place shortly before Bassett's departure in January, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> he soon returned to the side under Steve Harrison, Watford were relegated in 1988. At the time of the club's relegation, Gibbs had made precisely 100 First Division appearances.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{had planned}} to settle Greek colonists on Bahrain, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> {{it is not clear}} that this {{happened}} on the scale he envisaged, Bahrain became very much part of the Hellenised world: the language of the upper classes was Greek (although Aramaic was in everyday use), while Zeus was worshipped in the form of the Arabian sun-god Shams. Bahrain even became the site of Greek athletic contests.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{suffrage}} {{movement in}} Wales attempted {{to show a}} level of independence, it was always following rather than leading a national agenda. It depended deeply in its embryonic years on celebrated suffragists from outside its borders to bring crowds to town meetings, but still relied on a network of now forgotten non-militant supporters who organised and campaigned on the ground level. <b>And,</b> <b>although</b> failing to significantly draw a rural Welsh-speaking heartland to its cause, it still embraced a national sense of pride and values that contrasted to their neighbours in England.|$|E
5|$|<b>And</b> <b>although</b> it is a {{literary}} anachronism to connect Virgil to Erichtho, given that Lucan—the one who popularized Erichtho in literature—was born around {{fifty years after}} the death of Virgil, this connection successfully plays upon the popular Medieval belief that Virgil himself was a magician and prophet.|$|E

5|$|Antimotility {{medication}} has {{a theoretical}} risk of causing complications, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> clinical experience has shown {{this to be}} unlikely, these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever. Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea. Loperamide is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, {{can be used in}} mild to moderate cases, but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.|$|E
5|$|As a naturalistic writer, he was {{amongst the}} first English-language authors {{to absorb the}} lessons of the French realists, and was {{particularly}} influenced by the works of Émile Zola.

5|$|At Edinburgh University, Childe {{focused on}} research, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> {{reportedly}} very kind towards his students, had difficulty speaking to large audiences; he organised the BSc degree course {{so that it}} began studying the Iron Age, progressing chronologically backward to the Palaeolithic, confusing many students. Founding the Edinburgh League of Prehistorians, he took his more enthusiastic students on excavations and invited guest lecturers to visit. Involving them in experimental archaeology, {{of which he was}} an early proponent, in 1937 he performed experiments to understand the vitrification process that had occurred at several Iron Age forts in northern Britain.|$|E
