5|$|The raskovnik is {{believed}} to have been sought after by treasure hunters, sorcerers and herbalists who desired its magic powers for personal benefit. In Serbia, it was believed that there exist certain treasures, such as the Treasure of Tsar Radovan, which could not be unlocked in <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> but employing a raskovnik.|$|E
5|$|Coordination {{of rescue}} efforts August 29 and August 30 were made {{difficult}} by {{disruption of the}} communications infrastructure. Many telephones, including most cell phones, and Internet access were inoperable because of line breaks, destruction of base stations, or power failures, even though some base stations had their own back-up generators. In a number of cases, reporters were asked to brief public officials on the conditions in areas where information was not reaching them <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice, {{concerned}} about the additional competition and unable to obtain additional Boeing 707 aircraft <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way,</b> began talks in April 1962 to merge BOAC's North Atlantic operations with those of Cunard Eagle. Agreement was reached in early June 1962 on ownership percentages, and the newly formed company, BOAC-Cunard, began operations later that month. The new airline would operate all the transatlantic services of BOAC and Cunard Eagle from 1962 to 1966. Smallpeice served as {{managing director of the}} joint venture, in addition to his role as managing director of BOAC itself.|$|E

50|$|Although {{there can}} be <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> of doing {{business}}, a business brokerage usually earns its commission after the business broker and a seller enter into a listing contract and fulfill agreed-upon terms specified within that contract.

5|$|The {{game was}} {{initially}} {{developed as a}} demo by Urban Squall during the group's annual development meeting, in a San Diego hotel during November 2008. The demo was further tested after the five-day meeting, resulting in the complete game being released during March. The game's theme {{was inspired by the}} short story Everything Can Be Beaten by Jhonen Vasquez, which features a monster that clubs animals to death and is unable to interact with them in <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
5|$|Termites {{construct}} shelter tubes, {{also known}} as earthen tubes or mud tubes, that start from the ground. These shelter tubes {{can be found on}} walls and other structures. Constructed by termites during the night, a time of higher humidity, these tubes provide protection to termites from potential predators, especially ants. Shelter tubes also provide high humidity and darkness and allow workers to collect food sources that cannot be accessed in <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> These passageways are made from soil and faeces and are normally brown in colour. The size of these shelter tubes depends on the amount of food sources that are available. They range from less than 1cm to several cm in width, but may extend dozens of metres in length.|$|E
5|$|The bipedal-quadrupedal {{consensus}} was changed by a {{detailed study of}} the forelimbs of Plateosaurus by Bonnan and Senter (2007), which clearly showed that Plateosaurus was incapable of pronating its hands. The pronated position in some museum mounts had been achieved by exchanging the position of radius and ulna in the elbow. The lack of forelimb pronation meant that Plateosaurus was an obligate (i.e. unable to walk in <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way)</b> biped. Further indicators for a purely bipedal mode of locomotion are the great difference in limb length (the hind limb is roughly {{twice as long as}} the forelimb), the very limited motion range of the forelimb, {{and the fact that the}} centre of mass rests squarely over the hind limbs.|$|E

5|$|Since gluons carry color charge, they {{themselves}} are able to emit and absorb other gluons. This causes asymptotic freedom: as quarks come closer to each other, the chromodynamic binding force between them weakens. Conversely, as the distance between quarks increases, the binding force strengthens. The color field becomes stressed, much as an elastic band is stressed when stretched, and more gluons of appropriate color are spontaneously created to strengthen the field. Above a certain energy threshold, pairs of quarks and antiquarks are created. These pairs bind with the quarks being separated, causing new hadrons to form. This phenomenon is known as color confinement: quarks never appear in isolation. This process of hadronization occurs before quarks, formed in a high energy collision, are able to interact in <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> The only exception is the top quark, which may decay before it hadronizes.|$|E

25|$|In the {{presence}} of small bubbles, the solubility of the gas {{does not depend on}} the bubble radius in <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> than through the effect of the radius on pressure (i.e., the solubility of gas in the liquid in contact with small bubbles is increased due to pressure increase by Δp=2γ/r; see Young–Laplace equation).|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} difference to {{other types of}} English is the limited repertoire of consonants, vowels (6) and diphthongs (3) used. This produces a lot of homophones, like thin, thing and tin which are all three pronounced like /tin/. This circumstance gives a high importance to the context, the tone, the body language and <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> of communication for the distinction of the homophones.|$|R

25|$|The {{inability}} to communicate, verbally or non-verbally, is a core deficit in Autism. Children with Autism are often engaged in repetitive activity or other behaviors because they cannot convey their intent <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> They {{do not know}} how to communicate their ideas to caregivers or others. Helping a child with Autism learn to communicate their needs and ideas is absolutely core to any intervention. Communication can either be verbal or non-verbal.

25|$|In 2005, Gary Leiterman {{was convicted}} of the 1969 murder of Jane Mixer, a law student at the University of Michigan, after DNA found on Mixer's pantyhose was matched to Leiterman.

It will be necessary for me to refer to this hypothesis so frequently, that, to save circumlocution, I shall call it the hypothesis of Biogenesis; and I shall term the contrary doctrine–that living matter may be produced by not living matter–the hypothesis of Abiogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Home sign arises due to {{the absence}} of <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> to communicate.

Still, this kind of system is inadequate for the intellectual development of a child and it comes nowhere near meeting the standards linguists use to describe a complete language. No type of home sign is recognized as a full language.|$|E
