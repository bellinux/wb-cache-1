5|$|Exogenous dsRNA is {{detected}} <b>and</b> <b>bound</b> by an effector protein, known as RDE-4 in C. elegans and R2D2 in Drosophila, that stimulates dicer activity. This protein only binds long dsRNAs, but the mechanism producing this length specificity is unknown.

5|$|Sthiti (the {{duration}} of the karmic bond) – The karmic bond remains latent <b>and</b> <b>bound</b> to the consciousness up to the time it is activated. Although latent karma {{does not affect the}} soul directly, its existence limits the spiritual growth of the soul. Jain texts provide the minimum and the maximum duration for which such karma is bound before it matures.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream {{of the open}} reading frame that alter expression. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (<b>and</b> <b>bound</b> transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.|$|E

The bowl catches the venom, but when the bowl becomes full Loki writhes in extreme pain, causing the earth to shake and resulting in what we know as an earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{innovations}} of Felice Beato and Baron Raimund von Stillfried, Farsari {{further developed the}} trade in photograph albums. His studio generally produced sepia monochrome albumen prints that were hand-coloured and mounted on album leaves. These pages were often hand decorated <b>and</b> <b>bound</b> between covers of silk brocade or lacquer boards inlaid with ivory, mother-of-pearl and gold. Like his contemporaries, Farsari usually captioned and numbered his photographs in the images, often in white lettering on a black background.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} months of winter {{darkness}} Joyce and Wild printed around 30copies of the expedition's book, Aurora Australis, which were sewn <b>and</b> <b>bound</b> using packaging materials. The most important winter's work, however, {{was preparing for}} the following season's major journeys, which were to include attempts on both the South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. By making his base in McMurdo Sound, Shackleton {{had been able to}} reinstate the Magnetic Pole as an expedition objective. Shackleton himself would be leading the South Pole journey, which had suffered a serious setback during the winter when four of the remaining ponies died, mainly from eating volcanic sand for its salt content.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} {{the first edition of}} Leaves of Grass, critical responses began focusing more on the potentially offensive sexual themes. Though the second edition was already printed <b>and</b> <b>bound,</b> the publisher almost did not release it. In the end, the edition went to retail, with 20 additional poems, in August 1856. Leaves of Grass was revised and re-released in 1860 again in 1867, and several more times throughout the remainder of Whitman's life. Several well-known writers admired the work enough to visit Whitman, including Amos Bronson Alcott and Henry David Thoreau.|$|E

Others from the Village went as well and joined the group, organized in 1915 by George Cram Cook and his wife, Susan Glaspell, who hoped to produce plays that were both political and artistic. Among the works the group staged in 1916 were Bryant's The Game, in which characters named Life and Death play dice for the lives of Youth (a poet) and Girl (a dancer).

5|$|Murasaki is {{best known}} for her The Tale of Genji, a three-part novel {{spanning}} 1100 pages and 54 chapters, which is thought to have taken a decade to complete. The earliest chapters were possibly written for a private patron either during her marriage or shortly after her husband's death. She continued writing while at court and probably finished while still in service to Shōshi. She would have needed patronage to produce a work of such length. Michinaga provided her with costly paper and ink, and with calligraphers. The first handwritten volumes were probably assembled <b>and</b> <b>bound</b> by ladies-in-waiting.|$|E

Rosenbach in 1923, and passed into the collection of Arthur A. Houghton.

5|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} for military action during Nyuserre's reign. William C.

The art historian William Stevenson Smith has pointed out, that such statues were customary elements of the decoration of royal temples and mastabas, suggesting {{that they may not}} be immediately related to actual military campaigns. Similar statues and small wooden figures of kneeling captives were discovered in the mortuary complexes of Neferefre, Djedkare Isesi, Unas, Teti, Pepi I and Pepi II {{as well as in the}} tomb of vizier Senedjemib Mehi.|$|E
