It first earned a Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification under the United States Green Building Council LEED for New Construction program in 2004 and later Platinum Certification under LEED-EB (LEED for Existing Buildings) in 2007. The library's flooring is made of recycled rubber tires and there <b>are</b> <b>charging</b> stations for electric vehicles in the parking lot. In 2007, a rooftop garden was established atop the library, in addition to existing solar panels. The garden collects runoff and is maintained {{without the use of}} gasoline-powered lawn mowers and chemical pesticides or fertilizers.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{believe that}} the Iranian Interest-Free banking law has simply created the context for legitimizing usury or riba. In reality all banks <b>are</b> <b>charging</b> their borrowers a fixed pre-set amount {{at a rate of}} {{interest}} that is approved by the Central Bank at least once a year. No goods or services are exchanged as part of these contracts and banks rarely assume any Commercial Risk. High value collateral items such as real estate, commercial paper, bank guarantees and machinery eliminate any risk of loss. In case of defaults or bankruptcies, the principal amount, the expected interest and the late fees are collected through possession and or sale of secured collaterals.|$|E
25|$|The {{legislation}} {{provided for}} {{two levels of}} courts: a number of Local Courts to established in each of Malawi's 27 districts, mainly in rural areas and District Appeals Local Courts, one in each district, to hear appeals from the Local Courts. Further appeals may {{be made to the}} High Court, to which both types of Local Courts are subordinate. Each local court and District Appeals Local Court would be headed by chairperson, who need not be a lawyer, but with a reasonable standard of education, proficiency in English and adequate knowledge of the customary law and language of the area that the court serves. Local Courts also have assessors to advise on local customary law. Assessor must be at least 50 years old. The Local Courts would have no jurisdiction over civil cases involving title to or ownership of customary land, property inheritance involving the guardianship of infants, issues of witchcraft or about a chief's title. This is to help limit possible corruption. Complaints have been made that the Local Courts, popularly called Traditional Courts <b>are</b> <b>charging</b> excessive court fees to settle disputes.|$|E
500|$|Ofcom {{estimates}} {{that even after}} extra spectrum has been allocated to DAB, around 90local radio stations {{will be unable to}} transmit on DAB, either because there is no space for them on a local DAB multiplex, or because they cannot afford the high transmission costs of DAB that the multiplex operators <b>are</b> <b>charging.</b> Ofcom announced in 2005 that it regarded Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) as an option for local stations unable to secure carriage or unable to pay the high transmission costs of DAB. The success of the small scale DAB multiplexes may alleviate this issue to some degree. One of the drawbacks of DAB and DAB+ has not been addressed. In simple terms the frequency of a broadcast is the carrier frequency (i.e. a sine wave). In order to carry any information the carrier frequency must be modulated. The signal at the receiver (radio) is then demodulated and the information is retrieved. The demodulators for FM signals are almost instantaneous so that one can have radios in different areas and move between those areas to hear the broadcast continuously. In contrast the demodulators for digital signals take a finite time and each digital radio takes a different time to demodulate the broadcast signal, so that if you move between different radios that are spatially apart you are likely to hear the same part of the broadcast twice or miss parts of it depending on the time to demodulate the signal of the individual radios. The other drawback with DAB is that it is all or nothing. If there is any interference or loss due to moving out of the footprint of the broadcast signal you will receive no signal, whereas in the case of FM you can hear something even if it is crackly.|$|E

2500|$|The {{difficulty}} in {{gaining access to}} certain medicines and treatments has led to healthcare playing an increasing role in Cuba's burgeoning black market economy, sometimes termed [...] "sociolismo". According to former leading Cuban neurosurgeon and dissident Dr Hilda Molina, [...] "The doctors in the hospitals <b>are</b> <b>charging</b> patients under the table for better or quicker service." [...] Prices for out-of-surgery X-rays have been quoted at $50 to $60. Such [...] "under-the-table payments" [...] reportedly {{date back to the}} 1970s, when Cubans used gifts and tips in order to get health benefits. The harsh economic downturn known as the [...] "Special Period" [...] in the 1990s aggravated these payments. The advent of the [...] "dollar economy", a [...] legalization of the dollar which led some Cubans to receive dollars from their relatives outside of Cuba, meant that a class of Cubans were able to obtain medications and health services that would not be available to them otherwise.|$|E
