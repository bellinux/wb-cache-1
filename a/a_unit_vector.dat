25|$|<b>A</b> <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> is any vector with {{a length}} of one; {{normally}} unit vectors are used simply to indicate direction. A vector of arbitrary length can be divided by its length to create <b>a</b> <b>unit</b> <b>vector.</b> This is known as normalizing a vector. <b>A</b> <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> is often indicated with a hat as in â.|$|E

5000|$|Let [...] be a Frenet-Serret {{orthonormal}} basis {{which consists}} of <b>a</b> tangential <b>unit</b> <b>vector,</b> <b>a</b> normal <b>unit</b> <b>vector,</b> and <b>a</b> binormal <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> to the streamline, respectively.Since a streamline is a curve that is tangent to the velocity vector of the flow, the left-handed side of the above equation, the convective derivative of velocity, {{can be described as}} follows:where [...] is the radius of curvature of the streamline.|$|R
2500|$|The above {{results can}} be derived perhaps more simply in polar coordinates, {{and at the same}} time {{extended}} to general motion within a plane, as shown next.

25|$|The {{rotation}} vector, {{from the}} axis-angle representation of rotations, is a compact way of representing rotations in three dimensions. In its most compact form, {{it consists of}} a vector, the product of <b>a</b> <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> ω that is the axis of rotation with the (signed) angle of rotation θ, so that {{the magnitude of the}} overall rotation vector θω equals the (unsigned) rotation angle.|$|E
25|$|Treating a grain {{boundary}} geometrically as an interface {{of a single}} crystal cut into two parts, {{one of which is}} rotated, we see that there are five variables required to define a {{grain boundary}}. The first two numbers come from the unit vector that specifies a rotation axis. The third number designates the angle of rotation of the grain. The final two numbers specify the plane of the grain boundary (or <b>a</b> <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> that is normal to this plane).|$|E
25|$|Mathematically, a pure {{quantum state}} can be {{represented}} by a ray in a Hilbert space over the complex numbers. The ray {{is a set of}} nonzero vectors differing by just a complex scalar factor; any of them can be chosen as a state vector to represent the ray and thus the state. <b>A</b> <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> is usually picked, but its phase factor can be chosen freely anyway. Nevertheless, such factors are important when state vectors are added together to form a superposition.|$|E

500|$|The {{length of}} the vector is {{determined}} by calculating its Euclidean norm: the square root of the sum of squares of the vector components. When each component of the vector is divided by that length, the new vector will be <b>a</b> <b>unit</b> <b>vector</b> pointing in the same direction.

500|$|In {{some cases}} it may be easier to compute or {{estimate}} the directional derivative after changing {{the length of the}} vector. [...] Often this is done to turn the problem into the computation of a directional derivative in the direction of <b>a</b> <b>unit</b> <b>vector.</b> [...] To see how this works, suppose that [...] [...] Substitute [...] into the difference quotient.
