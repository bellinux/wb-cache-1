These data confirmed that no differences in permeability could be detected between newborn and adult BBB capillaries. No difference in brain uptake of glucose, amino acids, organic acids, purines, nucleosides, or choline was observed between adult and newborn rabbits.

In contrast to suggestions of an immature barrier in young animals, these studies indicate that a sophisticated, selective BBB is operative at birth.|$|E
500|$|The oxazolidinone pharmacophore—the {{chemical}} [...] "template" [...] {{essential for}} antimicrobial activity—consists of a 1,3-oxazolidin-2-one moiety with an aryl group at position 3 and an S-methyl group, with another substituent attached to it, at position 5 (the R-enantiomers of all oxazolidinones are devoid of antibiotic properties). In {{addition to this}} essential core, linezolid also contains several structural characteristics that improve its effectiveness and safety. An <b>acetamide</b> substituent on the 5-methyl group is the best choice in terms of antibacterial efficacy, and is used {{in all of the}} more active oxazolidinones developed thus far; in fact, straying too far from an <b>acetamide</b> group at this position makes the drug lose its antimicrobial power, although weak to moderate activity is maintained when some isosteric groups are used.
