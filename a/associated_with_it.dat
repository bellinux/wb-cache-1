5|$|A wake low, or wake depression, is a {{mesoscale}} low-pressure {{area which}} trails the mesoscale high following a squall line. Due to the subsiding warm air {{associated with the}} systems formation, clearing skies {{are associated with the}} wake low. Once difficult to detect in surface weather observations due to their broad spacing, the formation of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, has increased their detection. Severe weather, in the form of high winds, can be generated by the wake low when the pressure difference between the mesohigh preceding it and the wake low is intense enough. When the squall line {{is in the process of}} decay, heat bursts can be generated near the wake low. Once new thunderstorm activity along the squall line concludes, the wake low <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> weakens in tandem.|$|E
5|$|After the {{monument}} was discovered and {{identified in the}} twentieth century, a folk motif came to be <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> According to this story, the circle's stones had landed in their location after having been hurled at Corfe Castle by the Devil. This is a variant of {{a story that has}} also been connected to the Agglestone Rock near Studland.

5|$|Ancestors were worshiped in Qatna; {{the royal}} hypogeum {{provided}} {{a large amount}} of data concerning the cult of ancestor worshiping and the practices <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Two kinds of burials are distinguished; a primary burial intended to transport the dead into the netherworld, and a secondary burial that was intended to transform the deceased into their ultimate form: an ancestor. The royal hypogeum provides hints at the different rituals taking place during a secondary burial; a noticeable character is that skeletons were not complete, and no skulls are found for the majority of secondary burial remains. There is no evidence that skulls decayed as they would have left behind teeth, of which very few were found, indicating that the skulls were removed to be venerated in another location.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of the program were outweighed by the risks <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E
5|$|As the Doctor investigates, {{he realizes}} that alien energy lifeforms were beamed onto the ship within the {{containment}} field into which the protostar samples were transported. The missing crew members have been converted to energy by the lifeforms from the protostar, presumably as hostages in retaliation for Voyagers actions. The Doctor releases the energy lifeforms on the holodeck; in kind, the missing crew are returned to their original forms. Afterwards, upon reflection, the Doctor decides not to keep the name Schweitzer, as his memories <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> are too painful.|$|E
5|$|By August9, {{increasing}} {{wind shear}} further weakened the storm, with Felicia being downgraded to {{a tropical storm}} early that day. The storm rapidly weakened throughout the day as convection gradually dissipated around the center due to the shear. By the late morning hours, little convective activity remained around the low pressure center of Felicia. A weak cyclone, the storm continued to track towards Hawaii with the only deep convection <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> being displaced to the northeast of the center. The system slowly weakened before being downgraded to a tropical depression on August11 as no areas of tropical storm-force winds were found by Hurricane Hunters. Several hours after being downgraded, the CPHC issued its final advisory on Felicia as it degenerated into a remnant low near the Hawaiian Islands. The system dissipated shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Divine command theory {{features}} in the ethics of many modern religions, including Judaism, Islam, the Bah√°'√≠ Faith, and Christianity, {{as well as being}} a part of numerous older polytheistic religions. In ancient Athens, it was commonly held that moral truth was tied directly to divine commands, and religious piety was almost equivalent to morality. Although Christianity does not entail divine command theory, it is commonly <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> It can be a plausible theory to Christians because the traditional conception of God as the creator of the universe supports the idea that he created moral truths. The theory is supported by the Christian view that God is all-powerful because this implies that God creates moral truths, rather than moral truths existing independently of him, which seems inconsistent with his omnipotence.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, a monsoon trough located {{west of the}} Northern Mariana Islands {{produced}} two tropical disturbances. The first of these tracked due west and later became Tropical Storm Irving. The second of these disturbances remained poorly organized and development into a tropical cyclone {{was expected to be}} slow. By July21, an area of low pressure formed within the system and convection <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> increased. Situated underneath an anticyclone, upper-level outflow also improved. Following further organization of the system, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 11W on July21; at this time, the depression was located about 555km (345mi) west of Guam. Further aided by a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northwest, the depression intensified into a tropical storm on July23 and was assigned the name Judy by the JTWC.|$|E
5|$|Livingstone {{continued}} {{his association with}} members of Trotskyite group Socialist Action, with the group's leader John Ross became his most important adviser, teaching him about economics. Investing in an advanced ¬£25,000 computer, he and Ross used the machine to undertake complex economic analysis, {{on the basis of}} which they began publishing the Socialist Economic Bulletin in 1990. Two other members of the group, Redmond O'Neill and Simon Fletcher, also became trusted advisers. When Socialist Action founded a campaign group, the Anti-Racist Alliance, Livingstone came to be closely <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> They campaigned on the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence {{and the rise of the}} far right British National Party, but were disadvantaged by an ongoing rivalry with the Anti-Nazi League.|$|E

5|$|Representative William McKinley and Senator Nelson W.

At Secretary of State James Blaine's urging, Harrison attempted to make the tariff more acceptable by urging Congress to add reciprocity provisions, which would allow the President to reduce rates when other countries reduced their rates on American exports. The tariff was removed from imported raw sugar, and sugar growers in the United States were given a two cent per pound subsidy on their production. Even with the reductions and reciprocity, the McKinley Tariff enacted the highest average rate in American history, and the spending <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> contributed to {{the reputation of the}} Billion-Dollar Congress.|$|E
