The present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of collective education life skills on mental health and resilience of teachers in Zahedan. The population of the study included all teachers <b>at</b> <b>schools</b> with normal stu-dents and teachers <b>at</b> <b>schools</b> with exceptional students in Zahedan, among which 60 teachers <b>at</b> normal <b>schools</b> and 20 teachers <b>at</b> exceptional <b>schools</b> were selected and placed in two groups of experimental and control, respectively.

40|$|AbstractThis paper studies drug offence <b>at</b> <b>schools</b> {{and their}} {{environment}} {{to explain why}} some but not all schools had drug offences. We used a geographical approach that integrated spatial data of crime, census, and the built environment to identify potential risk factors of drugs <b>at</b> <b>schools.</b> Based on all recorded drug offences <b>at</b> <b>schools</b> (2001 - 2008) {{in the region of}} York in Ontario, Canada, from the police, we geocoded the schools and analysed the associations between drugs <b>at</b> <b>schools</b> and their environment (i. e., neighbourhood characteristics of schools). Neighbourhood characteristics were represented by census socioeconomic variables (including unemployment, lone parent, residential instability, immigration, adults at home, education, and ethnic heterogeneity) and built environment variables (open space and housing type). The analyses were done using geographical information systems for geocoding and extraction of attributes that represent neighbourhood characteristics. Bayesian statistical methods with Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation were used to fit the logistic regression models adopted. One of the major findings was that drug offence <b>at</b> <b>schools</b> and lone parents in the school neighbourhoods is significantly associated. Our findings have the potential to contribute to relevant policy discussions in reducing drug activities <b>at</b> <b>schools.</b> Limitations of the study and further research are discussed...|$|R

5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown.

Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E
