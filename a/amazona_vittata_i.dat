5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon (<b>Amazona</b> <b>vittata),</b> {{also known}} as the Puerto Rican parrot or iguaca, is the only extant bird endemic to the {{archipelago}} of Puerto Rico belonging to the Neotropical genus Amazona. Measuring , the bird is a predominantly green parrot with a red forehead and white rings around the eyes. Two subspecies have been described, although there are doubts regarding the distinctiveness of the form gracilipes from Culebra Island, extinct since 1912. Its closest relatives are believed to be the Cuban amazon (Amazona leucocephala) and the Hispaniolan amazon (Amazona ventralis).|$|R

500|$|The Cacatuoidea {{are quite}} distinct, having a movable head crest, a {{different}} {{arrangement of the}} carotid arteries, a gall bladder, differences in the skull bones, and lack the Dyck texture feathers that—in the Psittacoidea—scatter light to produce the vibrant colours of so many parrots. Lorikeets were previously regarded as a family, Loriidae, [...] but are now considered a tribe (Loriini) within the subfamily Loriinae, family Psittaculidae. Some species, such as the Puerto Rican amazon (<b>Amazona</b> <b>vittata)</b> have had a population bottleneck [...] (in this case reduced to 13 individuals in 1975) and subsequently have low genetic variability and low reproductive success, leading to complications with conservation.|$|R
500|$|There is no {{evidence}} that the West Indies were connected to a continent in the past, and thus the various native bird species are assumed to be descended from those that immigrated to the Caribbean at some point. Some small species would have encountered problems traversing large bodies of water, but parrots have flight strength and various behavioral characteristics that would facilitate [...] "over-water" [...] dispersion. Most Caribbean bird species originate from Central, North and South America. The Amazona species found in the Caribbean are divided in two groups: five mid-sized species found in the Greater Antilles and seven large species in the Lesser Antilles. All the Greater Antillean amazons display characteristics leading to suppositions of relatedness, including predominantly green-toned color patterns and white rings around the eyes. Russello and Amato conclude that all Greater Antillean Amazona descend from Amazona albifrons with <b>Amazona</b> <b>vittata,</b> <b>Amazona</b> leucocephala, and Amazona ventralis constituting a complex, a cluster of species so closely related that they intergrade.|$|R
25|$|As of 1998, 239 plants, 16 {{birds and}} 39 amphibians/reptiles have been {{discovered}} that are endemic to the archipelago of Puerto Rico. The majority of these (234, 12 and 33 respectively) are found on the main island. The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride are the coquís (Eleutherodactylus spp.), small frogs easily recognized by the sound from which they get their name. El Yunque National Forest, a tropical rainforest, {{is home to the}} majority (13 of 16) of species of coquí.

40|$|The genome of the Puerto Rican parrot (<b>Amazona</b> <b>vittata)</b> {{has been}} sequenced and {{assembled}} {{in an international}} collaboration supported by many individual donations from the people of Puerto Rico. This is a critically endangered endemic bird, the only surviving native parrot species in {{the territory of the}} United States, and the first parrot belonging to the large genus Amazona to have its genome sequenced and assembled. A genome of one A. vittata female was sequenced resulting in a total of almost 42. 5 billion nucleotide bases equivalent to 26. 89 X average coverage depth. After filtering out the short fragments (&#x 3 c; 500 bp), the assembly resulted in 259, 423 short fragment library contigs, half of them (N 50) of at least 6, 983 bp in length, with a longest contig at 75, 003, and 148, 255 long fragment library of scaffolds with N 50 = 19, 470 with the longest at 206, 462 bp length. Further sequencing is needed to generate enough coverage of the genome and close the assembly gaps. To our knowledge, this is the first genome project to be initiated and supported by local community fundraising efforts, and represents a model for the future of de novo genome projects for conservation genetics of nonhuman species...|$|R
40|$|Critically Endangered Puerto Rican parrots <b>Amazona</b> <b>vittata</b> {{are one of}} {{the rarest}} birds in the world. Several exotic mammal species capable of preying on Puerto Rican parrots cohabit the Caribbean National Forest with the only wild {{population}} of these parrots. We used tracking plates, monitoring blocks and trapping to index black rats, small Indian mongooses and feral cats in parrot habitat and in public-use areas in the same habitat type. We had high trap success for black rats at all sites (42 % of all sites combined), among the highest reported in the world. Rat response to monitoring (nontoxic bait) blocks was universally high, regardless of ground or tree placement. Mongooses were present at all sites, with a greater proportion of plates tracked within the forest than at public-use sites. Cats were present at all forest sites and one of the public-use sites. Presence of the three species {{did not appear to be}} linked to human disturbance. Because only 30 – 40 Puerto Rican parrots survive in the wild, with as few as three pairs nesting in 2002, we concluded that the abundance and pervasiveness of exotic mammalian predators poses a greater threat to the parrots than has been generally acknowledged. This is evidenced by mammalian predation during recent parrot breeding seasons, including six fledglings taken by mongooses and one nest failure from rats during 2000 – 2003...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Amazona</b> <b>vittata</b> is a {{critically}} endangered Puerto Rican endemic bird, the only surviving native parrot {{species in the}} United States territory, and the first parrot in the large Neotropical genus Amazona, to be studied on a genomic scale. Findings In a unique community-based funded project, DNA from an A. vittata female was sequenced using a HiSeq Illumina platform, {{resulting in a total}} of ~ 42. 5 billion nucleotide bases. This provided approximately 26. 89 x average coverage depth at the completion of this funding phase. Filtering followed by assembly resulted in 259, 423 contigs (N 50 [*]=[*] 6, 983 bp, longest[*]=[*] 75, 003 bp), which was further scaffolded into 148, 255 fragments (N 50 [*]=[*] 19, 470, longest[*]=[*] 206, 462 bp). This provided ~ 76 % coverage of the genome based on an estimated size of 1. 58 Gb. The assembled scaffolds allowed basic genomic annotation and comparative analyses with other available avian whole-genome sequences. Conclusions The current data represents the first genomic information from and work carried out with a unique source of funding. This analysis further provides a means for directed training of young researchers in genetic and bioinformatics analyses and will facilitate progress towards a full assembly and annotation of the Puerto Rican parrot genome. It also adds extensive genomic data to a new branch of the avian tree, making it useful for comparative analyses with other avian species. Ultimately, the knowledge acquired from these data will contribute to an improved understanding of the overall population health of this species and aid in ongoing and future conservation efforts. </p...|$|R
40|$|Forty Dippers Cinclus cinclus hibernicus {{were caught}} and deloused in {{southwest}} Ireland in 2003. Two species of lice (Mallophaga) were recorded; Philopterus cincli and Myrsidea franciscoloi. Both these species are known ectoparasites of the Dipper, yet these records {{were the first}} for Ireland. The incidence and infestation rates reported {{in this study were}} significantly greater than those recorded in Dippers from two studies in Wales and Germany. Ectoparasites {{play an important role in}} the lives of birds. As with other biotic interactions, such as predation and competition, parasitism has far reaching implications for the ecology and evolution of a species. Indeed, the study of bird-ectoparasite associations has provided many influential examples of parasite-mediated ecology and evolution (Proctor & Owens 2000). In recent years, parasitism has received much attention from a conservation perspective. For example, Loye & Carroll (1995) detail how a parasitic fly has determined the fate of the endangered Puerto Rican Parrot <b>Amazona</b> <b>vittata.</b> Therefore, studies of bird-ectoparasite associations, such as this one, provide valuable scientific information. This paper describes aspects of the population of feather lice (Mallophaga) collected from 40 Irish Dippers Cinclus cinclus hibernicus. In keeping with standard usage (Margolis et al 1982) we refer to host specificity as the species of lice associated with the host, the incidence rate as the proportion of hosts which are infested, and the infestation rate as the average number of parasites per host. The aim of this study was to examine the occurrence and distribution of Mallophaga on Dippers from Ireland. We also compare our findings to those recorded for Dipper populations in Wales (C...|$|R
