6000|$|... "Did he? Well now, the rascal {{invariably}} looks quite blank when I mention Marizano's name, <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{as if he}} {{had never}} heard of it before." ...|$|E

6000|$|The doctor {{feels the}} pulse of the woman, or rather lays an inquiring finger where the {{slightest}} thread of vital current is scarcely throbbing, <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> mournfully. The touch of his hand rouses her,--her large wild, melancholy eyes fix themselves on him with an inquiring glance, then she shivers and moans,-- ...|$|E
60|$|The old butler, who was {{formerly}} footman, and a rejected admirer of hers, {{used to tell}} the anecdote now and then, at those little cabals that will occasionally take place among the most orderly servants, arising from the common propensity of the governed to talk against administration; but he has left it off, of late years, since he has risen into place, <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> rebukingly when it is mentioned.|$|E
60|$|The Antiquary is a {{frequent}} visitor at Knockwinnock and Glenallan House, ostensibly {{for the sake of}} completing two essays, one on the mail-shirt of the Great Earl, and the other on the left-hand gauntlet of Hell-in-Harness. He regularly inquires whether Lord Geraldin has commenced the Caledoniad, <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at the answers he receives. En attendant, however, he has completed his notes, which, we believe, will be at the service of any one who chooses to make them public without risk or expense to THE ANTIQUARY.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Guppy {{suspects}} {{everybody who}} enters on {{the occupation of}} a stool in Kenge and Carboy's office of entertaining, {{as a matter of}} course, sinister designs upon him. He is clear that every such person wants to depose him. If he be ever asked how, why, when, or wherefore, he shuts up one eye <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> On the strength of these profound views, he in the most ingenious manner takes infinite pains to counterplot when there is no plot, and plays the deepest games of chess without any adversary.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{everybody}} {{has his own}} interpretation for that picture," [...] said Nello; [...] "and if you ask Piero himself {{what he meant by}} it, he says his pictures are an appendix which Messer Domeneddio has been pleased to make to the universe, and if any man is in doubt what they mean, he had better inquire of Holy Church. He has been asked to paint a picture after the sketch, but he puts his fingers to his ears <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at that; the fancy is past, he says--a strange animal, our Piero. But now all is ready for your initiation into the mysteries of the razor." ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR MOTHER,--I give {{my father}} up. I {{give him a}} parable: that the Waverley novels are better reading for every day than the tragic Life. And he takes it {{backside}} foremost, <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and is gloomier than ever. Tell him that I give him up. I don't want no such a parent. This is not the man for my money. I do not call that {{by the name of}} religion which fills a man with bile. I write him a whole letter, bidding him beware of extremes, and telling him that his gloom is gallows-worthy; and I get back an answer--Perish the thought of it.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} me with a half-suppressed pity, <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R

60|$|Having an {{extensive}} connexion among {{that kind of}} people who make acquaintances and eschew friends, the formal gentleman attends from time to time a great many funerals, to which he is formally invited, and to which he formally goes, as returning a call for the last time. Here his deportment is of the most faultless description; he knows the exact pitch of voice it is proper to assume, the sombre look he ought to wear, the melancholy tread which should be his gait for the day. He is perfectly acquainted with all the dreary courtesies to be observed in a mourning-coach; knows when to sigh, and when to hide his nose in the white handkerchief; and looks into the grave <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> when the ceremony is concluded, with the sad formality of a mute.|$|E
60|$|CARMODY. It's {{the dead}} spit and image of your sister Eileen you are, with your nose {{always in a}} book; and you're like your mother, too, God rest her soul. (He crosses himself with pious unction and Mary also does so.) It's Nora and Tom has the high spirits in them like their father; and Billy, too,--if he is a lazy, shiftless divil--has the fightin' Carmody blood like me. You're a Cullen like your mother's people. They always was dreamin' their lives out. (He lights his pipe <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> with {{ponderous}} gravity.) There's no good in too many books, I'll tell you. It's out rompin' and playin' with your brother and sister {{you ought to be}} at your age, not carin' a fig for books. (With a glance at the clock.) Is that auld fool of a doctor stayin' the night? If he had his wits about him he'd know in a jiffy 'tis only a cold has taken Eileen, and give her the medicine. Run out in the hall, Mary, and see if you hear him. He may have sneaked away by the front door.|$|E
60|$|He is, be it repeated, a very {{beautiful}} youth, moving as in a dream, walking as on air. He puts his flowers down carefully {{on the table beside}} the fan; takes off his cape, and, as there is no room on the table for it, takes it to the piano; puts his hat on the cape; crosses to the hearth; looks at his watch; puts it up again; notices the things on the table; lights up as if he saw heaven opening before him; goes to the table and takes the cloud in both hands, nestling his nose into its softness and kissing it; kisses the gloves one after another; kisses the fan: gasps a long shuddering sigh of ecstasy; sits down on the stool and presses his hands to his eyes to shut out reality and dream a little; takes his hands down <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> with a little smile of rebuke for his folly; catches sight of a speck of dust on his shoes and hastily and carefully brushes it off with his handkerchief; rises and takes the hand mirror from the table to make sure of his tie with the gravest anxiety; and is looking at his watch again when She comes in, much flustered. As she is dressed for the theatre; has spoilt, petted ways; and wears many diamonds, she has an air of being a young and beautiful woman; but as a matter of hard fact, she is, dress and pretensions apart, a very ordinary South Kensington female of about 37, hopelessly inferior in physical and spiritual distinction to the beautiful youth, who hastily puts down the mirror as she enters.|$|E
60|$|The Count, {{with the}} most {{alarming}} solemnity, sighed <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R

6000|$|Bubbles {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fascinating}} of sports. There is the soft foamy mass, like driven snow, or like whipped cream. Blanche bends down to blow [...] "a honeycomb," [...] holding the bowl of the pipe in the water; at her gurgling blasts there slowly heaves upwards the pile of larger, clearer bubbles, each reflecting the whole scene, and sparkling with rainbow tints, until Aubrey ruthlessly dashes all into fragments with his hand, and Mary pronounces it stiff enough, and presents a pipe to little Daisy, who, drawing the liquid into her mouth, throws it away with a grimace, and declares that she does not like bubbles! But Aubrey stands with swelled cheeks, gravely puffing at the sealing-waxed extremity. Out pours a confused assemblage of froth, but the glassy globe slowly expands the little branching veins, flowing down on either side, bearing an enlarging miniature of the sky, the clouds, the tulip-tree. Aubrey pauses to exclaim! but where is it? Try again! A proud bubble, as Mary calls it, a peacock, in blended pink and green, is this transparent sphere, reflecting and embellishing house, wall, and shrubs! It is too beautiful! It is gone! Mary undertakes to give a lesson, and blows deliberately without the slightest result. Again! She waves her disengaged hand in silent exultation as the airy balls detach themselves, and float off on the summer breeze, with a tardy, graceful, uncertain motion. Daisy rushes after them, catches at them, and looks at her empty fingers with a puzzled [...] "All gone!" [...] as plainly expressed by Toby, who snaps at them, <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> with offended dignity at the shock of his meeting teeth, while the kitten frisks after them, striking at them with her paw, amazed at meeting vacancy.|$|E
5000|$|He never laughs. Instead, {{he covers}} {{his mouth with}} his hand <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> like he was {{laughing}} ...|$|E
50|$|Greg remarks {{what a great}} party it was, but now they're tired so it's time to go. They all {{say goodbye}} and fell asleep except for Jeff, who tries to wake {{everyone}} up but they don't wake up. Jeff then crosses his arms <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> with a sigh.|$|E
60|$|Shaggy {{looked at}} the little square of cloth <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
