5|$|In January, 2012, the Church of Scientology {{brought a}} lawsuit against Debbie Cook for {{defamation}} after she sent an e-mail to 3,000 Church members criticizing its fund-raising methods. The lawsuit against her was quickly settled without payment by any side on April 23, 2012 after Cook was permitted to testify for three hours regarding her description of conditions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hole.</b>|$|E
25|$|A flute {{produces}} {{sound when}} {{a stream of}} air directed across {{a hole in the}} instrument creates a vibration of air <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b> The airstream creates a Bernoulli or siphon. This excites the air contained in the usually cylindrical resonant cavity within the flute. The flutist changes the pitch of the sound produced by opening and closing holes {{in the body of the}} instrument, thus changing the effective length of the resonator and its corresponding resonant frequency. By varying the air pressure, a flutist can also change the pitch by causing the air in the flute to resonate at a harmonic rather than the fundamental frequency without opening or closing any holes.|$|E
25|$|Metals are {{typically}} isotropic, and an ordinary twist drill bit shears {{the edges of}} the hole cleanly. Wood drilled across the grain has long strands of wood fiber. These long strands tend {{to pull out of the}} wood hole, rather than being cleanly cut <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> edge. The lip and spur drill bit has the outside corner of the cutting edges leading, so that it cuts the periphery of the hole before the inner parts of the cutting edges plane off the base of the hole. By cutting the periphery first, the lip maximizes the chance that the fibers can be cut cleanly, rather than having them pull messily out of the timber.|$|E

25|$|The {{frequency}} of the tone determined by how often a vortex encountered the hole while moving at some speed u less than the initial jet speed. Since the jet slowed as it proceeded toward the hole, {{the speed of the}} vortex slowed with it so the frequency and Strouhal number was greater at closer spacing. The Strouhal number data showed clearly the almost linear relation between frequency and initial jet speed. The number would be more constant if the actual jet speed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> could have been used as the characteristic speed. In four of the distances tested, there were jumps between Stage I and Stage II. The hysteresis loops are clear indications of the complex nature of the jet instability gain structure.|$|E
500|$|The {{executives}} confined <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hole</b> {{are reported}} to have numbered up to 100 of the most senior figures in Scientology's management, including the Church of Scientology International's President, Heber Jentzsch. Individuals {{are said to have}} spent months or even years there. After a few managed to escape the Hole and Scientology, they gave accounts of their experiences to the media, the courts and the FBI, leading to widespread publicity about the harsh conditions that they had allegedly endured. The Church of Scientology has denied those accounts. It says that [...] "the Hole does not exist and never has" [...] and states that nobody had been held against their will. However, it acknowledges that its members are subjected to [...] "religious discipline, a program of ethics and correction entered into voluntarily as part of their religious [...] observances." [...] It has been described by ex-members comparable to that of a North Korean death camp.|$|E

On the evening of 16 September Glattons midships 6-inch magazine had a low-order explosion that ignited the cordite stored there.

The forward magazines were flooded, but the rear magazines were unable to be flooded as the flames blocked access to the controls. The presence of the ammunition ship Gransha only [...] away risked a massive explosion that would devastate Dover if Glattons rear magazine exploded and set off Granshas ammunition. Vice-Admiral Keyes ordered the destroyer [...] to torpedo Glatton in an attempt to flood the magazine before it detonated.

They were aimed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> blown in Glatton's starboard side by Cossacks second torpedo and caused Glatton to capsize until her masts and superstructure rested on the harbor bottom, dousing the fire.

Flames shot through the roof of 'Q' turret, starboard midside, and started to spread aft. The ship's captain—Commander N. W. Diggle—ordered the forward magazines flooded, but the crew were unable to flood the rear magazines as the flames blocked access to the magazine flooding controls. The presence of the ammunition ship Gransha only [...] away risked a massive explosion that would devastate Dover if Glattons rear magazine exploded and set off Granshas ammunition. Vice-Admiral Keyes—who had been walking with Commander Diggle when Glattons magazine exploded—boarded the recently arrived destroyer [...] once apprised of the danger. He ordered Cossack to torpedo Glatton in an attempt to flood the magazine before it detonated. Cossacks first [...] torpedo struck the anti-torpedo bulge amidships, but failed to explode because it had been fired too close to Glatton. Her second torpedo blew a hole in Glatton at 7:40, but the torpedo's [...] warhead was too small to penetrate through her bulge and Glatton remained afloat, still burning.

2500|$|He {{described}} a 'dark chamber' {{and did a}} number of trials of experiments with small pinholes and light passing through them. This experiment consisted of three candles {{in a row and}} seeing the affects on the wall after placing a cutout between the candles and the wall. Al-Haytham also analyzed the rays of sunlight and concluded that they make a conic shape where they meet <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> forming another conic shape reverse to the first one from the hole to the opposite wall in the dark room (see illustration). Ibn al-Haytham is reported to have stated about the camera obscura: [...] "We did not invent this". al-Haytam's writings on optics became very influential in Europe through Latin translations since circa 1200. Among the people who he inspired were Witelo, John Peckham, Roger Bacon, Leonardo Da Vinci, René Descartes and Johannes Kepler.|$|E
2500|$|The dealer deals {{cards from}} his/her left (the {{position}} on the dealer's far left {{is often referred to}} as [...] "first base") to his/her far right ("third base"). Each box is dealt an initial hand of two cards visible to the people playing on it, and often to any other players. The dealer's hand receives its first card face up, and in [...] "hole card" [...] games immediately receives its second card face down (the hole card), which the dealer peeks at but does not reveal unless it makes the dealer's hand a blackjack. Hole card games are sometimes played on tables with a small mirror or electronic sensor that is used to peek securely <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> card. In European casinos, [...] "no hole card" [...] games are prevalent; the dealer's second card is neither drawn nor consulted until the players have all played their hands.|$|E
