40|$|Liver grafts are {{frequently}} discarded due to steatosis.

Hypothermic machine perfusion (MP) has been introduced for preservation of donor livers instead of cold storage (CS), resulting in superior preservation outcomes. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare CS and MP for preservation of the steatotic donor rat liver. Liver steatosis was induced in male Wistar rats by a choline-methionine-deficient diet. After 24 hours hypothermic CS using the University of Wisconsin solution (UW) or MP using UW-Gluconate (UW-G), liver damage (liver enzymes, perfusate flow, and hyaluronic acid clearance) and liver function (bile <b>production,</b> <b>ammonia</b> clearance, urea <b>production,</b> oxygen consumption, adenosine triphosphate [ATP] levels) were assessed in an isolated perfused rat liver model. Furthermore, liver biopsies were visualized by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Animals developed 30 to 60 % steatosis. Livers preserved by CS sustained significantly more damage as compared to MP.

25|$|The {{most popular}} {{catalysts}} {{are based on}} iron promoted with K2O, CaO, SiO2, and Al2O3.

Under Bosch's direction in 1909, the BASF researcher Alwin Mittasch discovered a much less expensive iron-based catalyst, which is still used today. Some <b>ammonia</b> <b>production</b> utilizes ruthenium-based catalysts (the KAAP process). Ruthenium forms more active catalysts that allows milder operating pressures. Such catalysts are prepared by decomposition of triruthenium dodecacarbonyl on graphite.|$|E

25|$|In {{patients}} with grade I or II encephalopathy, enteral feeding should be initiated early. Parenteral nutrition {{should be used}} only if enteral feeding is contraindicated as it {{increases the risk of}} infection. Severe restriction of protein is not beneficial; 60 g/day of protein is generally reasonable. Fluid replacement with colloid (e.g. albumin) is preferred rather than crystalloid (e.g. saline); all solutions should contain dextrose to maintain euglycemia. Multiple electrolyte abnormalities are common in ALF. Correction of hypokalemia is essential as hypokalemia increases the kidneys' <b>ammonia</b> <b>production,</b> potentially exacerbating encephalopathy. Hypophosphatemia is especially common in {{patients with}} acetaminophen-induced ALF and in those with intact renal function. Hypoglycemia occurs in many patients with ALF and is often due to depletion of hepatic glycogen stores and impaired gluconeogenesis.

25|$|Starting in 2007, {{the prices}} of {{fertilizers}} of all kinds increased dramatically, peaking around the summer of 2008 (see graphs by the International Fertilizer Industry Association). Prices approximately tripled for ammonia, urea, diammonium phosphate, muriate of potash (KCl), and sulfuric acid (used for making phosphate fertilizer), and then fell just as dramatically {{in the latter part}} of 2008. Some prices doubled within the six months before April 2008. Part of the cause for these price rises was the rise in the price of oil, since the most fertilizers require petroleum or natural gas to manufacture. Although the main fossil fuel input for fertilizer comes from natural gas to generate hydrogen for the Haber–Bosch process (see: <b>Ammonia</b> <b>production),</b> natural gas has its own supply problems similar to those for oil. Because natural gas can substitute for petroleum in some uses (for example, natural gas liquids and electricity generation), increasing prices for petroleum lead to increasing prices for natural gas, and thus for fertilizer.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{and compares}} the economics and sustainability aspects of two hydrogenation processes for producing renewable methanol and ammonia by using wind-power based electrolytic hydrogen. Carbon dioxide from an ethanol plant {{is used for}} producing methanol, while the nitrogen is supplied by an Air Separation Unit (ASU) for producing ammonia. The capacities are 99. 96 mt/day methanol and 1202. 55 mt/day anhydrous ammonia. The methanol plant requires 138. 37 mt CO 2 /day and 19. 08 mt H 2 /day. The ammonia is synthesized by using 217. 72 mt H 2 /day and 1009. 15 mt N 2 /day. The production costs and the carbon equivalent emissions (CO 2 e) associated with the methanol and ammonia processes, electrolytic hydrogen production, carbon capture and compression, and ASU are estimated. The integral facilities of both the methanol and <b>ammonia</b> <b>productions</b> are evaluated by introducing a multi-criteria decision matrix containing economics and sustainability metrics. Discounted cash flow diagrams are established to estimate the economic constraints, unit product costs, and unit costs of hydrogen. The hydrogen cost is the largest contributor to {{the economics of the}} plants. For the methanol, the values of emissions are - 0. 85 kg CO 2 e/kg methanol as a chemical feedstock and + 0. 53 kg CO 2 e/kg methanol as a fuel with complete combustion. For the ammonia, the value of emission is around 0. 97 kg CO 2 e/kg ammonia. The electrolytic hydrogen from wind power helps reduce the emissions; however, the cost of hydrogen at the current level adversely affects the feasibility of the plants. A multi-criteria decision matrix shows that renewable methanol and ammonia with wind power-based hydrogen may be feasible compared with the nonrenewable ones and the renewable methanol may be more favorable than the ammonia...|$|R
