40|$|Abstract—A resolution-rate {{scalable}} ADC for micro-sensor net-works is described. Based on {{the successive}} approximation register (SAR) architecture, this ADC has two resolution modes: 12 bit and 8 bit, and its sampling rate is scalable, at a constant figure-of-merit, from 0 – 100 kS/s and 0 – 200 kS/s, respectively. At the highest per-formance point (i. e., 12 bit, 100 kS/s), the entire ADC (including digital, <b>analog,</b> and <b>reference</b> power) consumes 25 W from a 1 -V supply.
