40|$|Background: Polyvalent {{bacterial}} lysate (PBL) is an oral immunostimulating vaccine {{consisting of}} bacterial standardized ly-sates obtained by lysis of different strains of bacteria. Autovaccines are individually prepared {{based on the}} re-sults of smears obtained from the patient. Both types of vaccine {{can be used to}} treat an ongoing chronic in-fection. This study sought to determine which method is more effective against nasal colonization by potential respiratory tract pathogens. Material/Methods: We enrolled 150 patients with aerobic Gram stain culture and count results indicating bacterial colonization of the nose and/or throat by potential pathogens. The participants were randomly assigned to each of the fol-lowing groups: 1. administration of PBL, 2. administration of <b>autovaccine,</b> and 3. no intervention (controls). Results: Reduction of the bacterial count in Streptococcus pneumoniae-colonized participants was significant after the <b>autovaccine</b> (p< 0. 001) and PBL (p< 0. 01). Reduction of the bacterial count of other b-hemolytic streptococ-cal strains after treatment with the <b>autovaccine</b> was significant (p< 0. 01) and was non-significant after PBL. In Haemophilus influenzae colonization, significant reduction in the bacterial count was noted in the PBL group (p< 0. 01). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization did not respond to either treatment.

Sixteen of the vaccines (84 %) with normal phagocytic funetion responded well to the vaccine therapy while only 3 of the 13 (23 %) with poor phagocytic function showed the beneficial effects of the <b>autovaccines.</b> Thus the findings recommend the use of staphyloccoccal <b>autovaccines</b> in the cases with adequate phagocytic activity as seen by NBT reduction test but not as much for those with inadequate phagocytic function...|$|R

40|$|The {{spread of}} a highly virulent (HV) Staphylococcus aureus strain into a rabbit flock leads to a high {{percentage}} of rabbits suffering from subcutaneous abscesses, pododermatitis, mastitis, infertility and death with chronic poor production results for the rabbitry. In practice often all animals have to be culled and the rabbitry has to restart with a new flock. Some rabbit farmers however prefer to use an <b>autovaccine,</b> manufactured from the specific HV S. aureus strain circulating in their rabbitry, in an attempt to control the infection at flock level. Since the efficacy of such an <b>autovaccine</b> has not been scientifically proven, a double blinded experiment was designed to study this effect in an in vivo rabbit skin infection model under standardized experimental conditions. For this purpose, a culture of the HV S. aureus strain KH 171 was used to produce an autogenous bacterin based on a whole cell suspension of formalin killed bacteria in sterile buffered saline. On day one and fourteen of the experiment, ten twelve-week-old rabbits (group A) received subcutaneous injections with the prepared <b>autovaccine</b> while ten rabbits of group B were injected twice with sterile buffered saline.

40|$|Interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) and IL- 23 (which share a p 40 subunit) are pivotal cytokines in the {{generation}} of protective Th 1 /Th 17 -type immune responses upon infection with the intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The role of IL- 12 and IL- 23 in protection conferred by the tuberculosis vaccine Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is, however, less well documented. By using an <b>autovaccine</b> approach, i. e., IL- 12 p 70 cross-linked with ovalbumin and PADRE peptide formulated with the GSK proprietary adjuvant system AS 02 (V), we could specifically neutralize IL- 12 while leaving the IL- 23 axis intact. Neutralization of IL- 12 before M. tuberculosis challenge rendered C 57 BL/ 6 mice highly susceptible, resulting in 30 -fold-higher CFU in spleen and lungs and accelerated mortality. In contrast, neutralization of IL- 12 in BCG-vaccinated mice prior to M. tuberculosis challenge only marginally affected vaccine-mediated protection. Analysis of cytokine production in spleen and lungs 3 weeks post-TB challenge by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and functional and flow cytometric assays showed significantly reduced mycobacterium-specific gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) responses in M. tuberculosis-infected and BCG-vaccinated mice that had been treated with the <b>autovaccine.</b> Purified protein derivative-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL- 6, and IL- 17 A levels, however, were highest in lungs from BCG-vaccinated/IL- 12 -neutralized animals, and even unstimulated lung cells from these mice produced significant levels of the three cytokines. Mycobacterium-specific IL- 4 and IL- 5 production levels were overall very low, but IL- 12 neutralization resulted in increased concanavalin A-triggered polyclonal secretion of these Th 2 -type cytokines. These results suggest that TNF-alpha, IL- 6, and IL- 17 A {{may be more important}} pulmonary effector molecules of BCG-mediated protection than IFN-gamma in a context of IL- 12 deficiency. status: publishe...|$|E

All patients reported clinical improvement. Molecular characterization showed that all strains isolated from one patient over time belonged to the same clone. Already before treatment, there was robust antibody binding to a broad range of staphylococcal antigens. Autovaccination moderately boosted the IgG response to extracellular antigens in two patients, while the antibody response of the other two patients was not affected.

40|$|B cell {{activating}} factor (BAFF) is a cytokine of tumor necrosis factor family mainly {{produced by}} monocytes and dendritic cells. BAFF can regulate the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of B lymphocytes by binding with BAFF-R on B cell membrane. Accumulating evidences showed that BAFF played crucial roles and was overexpressed in various autoimmune {{diseases such as}} systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This suggests that BAFF may be a therapeutic target for these diseases. In the present study, we developed a BAFF therapeutic vaccine by coupling a T helper cell epitope AKFVAAWTLKAA (PADRE) to the N terminus of BAFF extracellular domains (PADRE-BAFF) and expressed this fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The purified vaccine can induce high titer of neutralizing BAFF antibodies and ameliorate the syndrome of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) induced rheumatoid arthritis in rats.

40|$|Abstract: Pleuropneumonia {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} bacterial diseases of the respiratory tract of the pig and occurs in most pig-keeping countries (2, 4, 5). Its importance derives from the fact that it can cause pneumonia that results in death, clinical disease may become chronic or subclinical disease in successive batches of pigs and can causes losses from death, reduced production, and increased costs of medication or vaccination. The goal of our research was to compare the following two vaccines used to prevent pig pleuropneumonia:- an inactivate <b>autovaccine,</b> adjuvantated produced by us, representing bacterine group- a subunit vaccine (Porcilis®APP) produced by Intervet, Holand, different by the first vaccine through composition.

40|$|TNF is {{a proinflammatory}} {{cytokine}} {{involved in the}} pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases, but also in metastasis in certain types of cancer. In terms of therapy, TNF is targeted by anti-TNF neutralising monoclonal antibodies or soluble TNF receptors. Recently, a novel strategy based on the generation of self anti-TNF antibodies (TNF autovaccination) has been developed. We have previously shown that TNF autovaccination successfully generates high anti-TNF antibody titres, blocks TNF and ameliorates collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/ 1 mice. In this study, we examined the ability of TNF autovaccination to generate anti-TNF antibody titres and block metastasis in the murine B 16 F 10 melanoma model. We found that immunisation of C 57 BL/ 6 mice with TNF <b>autovaccine</b> produces a 100 -fold antibody response to TNF compared to immunisation with phosphate-buffered saline vehicle control and significantly reduces both the number (P< 0. 01) and size of metastases (P< 0. 01) of B 16 F 10 melanoma cells. This effect is also observed when an anti-TNF neutralising monoclonal antibody is administered, confirming the essential role TNF plays in metastasis in this model. This study suggests that TNF autovaccination is a cheaper and highly efficient alternative that can block TNF and reduce metastasis in vivo and trials with TNF autovaccination are already underway in patients with metastatic cancer...|$|E
40|$|Excessive or {{inappropriate}} {{production of}} IL- 17 A {{has been reported}} in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and multiple sclerosis. The potential clinical relevance of these correlations was suggested by the protective effects of anti-IL- 17 A monoclonal antibodies in various mouse disease models. However, the chronic nature of the corresponding human afflictions raises great challenges for Ab-based therapies. An alternative to passive Ab therapy is autovaccination. Covalent association of self-cytokines with foreign proteins has been reported to induce the production of antibodies capable of neutralizing the biological activity of the target cytokine. We recently reported that cross-linking of IL- 17 A to ovalbumin produced highly immunogenic complexes that induced long-lasting IL- 17 A-neutralizing antibodies. Vaccinated SJL mice were completely protected against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by proteolipid protein peptide (PLP 139 - 151), and a monoclonal anti-IL- 17 A Ab (MM 17 F 3), derived from C 57 Bl/ 6 mice vaccinated against IL- 17 A-OVA, also prevented disease development. Here we report that this Ab also protects C 57 Bl/ 6 mice from myelin oligdendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) -induced EAE. Histological analysis of brain sections of C 57 Bl/ 6 mice treated with MM 17 F 3 showed a complete absence of inflammatory infiltrates and evidence for a marked inhibition of chemokine and cytokine messages in the spinal cord.

Methods: Prospective open trial on safety, tolerability, and impact on allergic inflammation of an autologous E. coli <b>autovaccine</b> in intermittent or mild persistent house dust mite asthma. Determination of exhaled nitric monoxide (eNO) before and after bronchial mite challenge initially and after nine months of autovaccination. Results: Median eNO increase after autovaccination was significantly smaller (from 27. 3 to 33. 8 ppb; p= 0. 334) compared to initial values (from 32. 6 to 42. 2 ppb; p= 0. 046) (p= 0. 034). In nine subjects and a total of 306 injections, we observed 101 episodes of local erythema (33. 3 %; median of maximal diameter 2. 5 cm), 95 episodes of local swelling (31. 1 %; median of maximal diameter 3 cm), and 27 episodes of local pain (8. 8 %). Four subjects reported itching at the injection site with a total of 30 episodes (9. 8 %). We observed no serious adverse events.

40|$|Background: In 2010, an Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica hispanica) stock {{reservoir}} {{was established}} for conservation purposes in north-eastern Spain. Eighteen ibexes were {{captured in the}} wild and housed in a 17 hectare enclosure. Once in captivity, a caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) outbreak occurred and ibex handlings were carried out at six-month intervals between 2010 and 2013 to perform health examinations and sampling. Treatment with a bacterin-based <b>autovaccine</b> and penicillin G benzatine was added during the third and subsequent handlings, when infection by Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis was confirmed. Changes in lesion score, serum anti-C. pseudotuberculosis antibodies and haematological parameters were analyzed to assess captivity effects, disease emergence and treatment efficacy. Serum acute phase proteins (APP) Haptoglobin (Hp), Amyloid A (SAA) and Acid Soluble Glycoprotein (ASG) concentrations were also determined to evaluate their usefulness as indicators of clinical status. Once in captivity, 12 out of 14 ibexes (85. 7 %) seroconverted, preceding the emergence of clinical signs; moreover, TP, WBC, eosinophil and platelet cell counts increased while monocyte and basophil cell counts decreased. After treatment, casualties and fistulas disappeared and both packed cell volume (PCV) and haemoglobin concentration significantly increased. Hp, SAA and ASG values were under the limit of detection or showed no significant differences. Conclusions: A role for captivity in contagion rate {{is suggested by the}} increase in antibody levels against C. pseudotuberculosis and the emergence of clinical signs. Although boosted by captivity, this is the first report of an outbreak of caseous lymphadenitis displaying high morbidity and mortality in wild ungulates. Treatment consisting of both vaccination and antibiotic therapy seemed to prevent mortality and alleviate disease severity, but was not reflected in the humoural response. Haematology and APP were not useful indicators in our study, perhaps due to the sampling frequency. Presumably endemic and irrelevant in the wild, this common disease of domestic small ruminants is complicating conservation efforts for the Iberian ibex in north-eastern Spain...|$|E

Technico-economic management session studied concepts for improving profitability of farms. Genetics session evaluated several maternal lines and cross does for longevity, and studied doe genetic origin, environmental conditions during lactation and kit survival during the fattening period. Ethology session analysed aggressiveness in breeding does, the effect of type of cage on does behaviour, and evaluated sampling techniques for assessing does behaviour. Reproduction and Body Composition session studied several aspects related to the body composition of does, the application of biolectrical impedance for its assessment, the effect of different treatments of ovulation induction, and the relation between the performance of the does and plasma concentration of non-esterified fatty acids. Carcass Quality session analysed the prediction of intramuscular fat and fatty acid content in rabbit meat by near infrared spectroscopy, the nutritional quality of rabbit meat fed with a feed enriched in Omega 3, risk factors related to rabbit digestive pathologies on carcass classification, the anatomical assessment and meat quality, and prediction of rabbit carcass composition using visual image analysis.
