5|$|A hub is able {{to support}} low {{bandwidth}} devices mixed with other speed device via a special PID value, PRE. This is required as a USB hub functions as a very simple repeater, broadcasting the host message to <b>all</b> <b>connected</b> devices regardless if the packet was for it or not. This means in a mixed speed environment, {{there is a potential}} danger that a low speed will misinterpret a high or full speed signal from the host.|$|E

5|$|Strange studies {{under the}} Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient {{books in the}} library that is now guarded by the master Wong. Strange learns that Earth is {{protected}} from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called Sanctums, in New York City, London, and Hong Kong, which are <b>all</b> <b>connected</b> and accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' task {{is to protect the}} Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into walking again. Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, drawing a comparison to Kaecilius' desire for eternal life.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an oblique, isometric format and is set inside a haunted castle. As Sir Arthur Pendragon, the player's main objective is to collect sixteen pieces of a key before midnight, which when <b>all</b> <b>connected</b> will form {{the shape of a}} pentacle. The pieces of the pentacle are guarded by various magical creatures, some of which can be defeated by casting spells, others requiring accurately timed attacks and nimble dodging. Once a piece is obtained, the player must take it to a specific chamber within the castle. Once all pentacles have been placed in their chambers, the player can establish the whereabouts of the Staff of Karnath, which must be destroyed before midnight.|$|E

5|$|When a USB {{device is}} first {{connected}} to a USB host, the USB device enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device. The data rate of the USB device is determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the USB device's information is read by the host and the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address. If the device {{is supported by the}} host, the device drivers needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for <b>all</b> <b>connected</b> devices.|$|E
5|$|Several {{causes for}} the decline and sudden {{disappearance}} of the hoopoe starling have been proposed, <b>all</b> <b>connected</b> to the activities of humans on Réunion, who it survived alongside for two centuries. An oft-repeated suggestion is that {{the introduction of the}} common myna (Acridotheres tristis) led to competition between these two starling species. The myna was introduced to Réunion in 1759 to combat locusts, and became a pest itself. However, the hoopoe starling coexisted with the myna for nearly 100years and they may not have shared habitat. The black rat (Rattus rattus) arrived on Reunion in the 1670s, and the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in 1735, multiplying rapidly and threatening agriculture and native species. Like the hoopoe starling, the rats inhabited tree cavities and would have preyed on eggs, juveniles, and nesting birds. During the mid-19th century the Réunion slit-eared skink (Gongylomorphus borbonicus) became extinct due to predation by the introduced wolf snake (Lycodon aulicum), which may have deprived the bird of a significant food source. Hoopoe starlings may have contracted diseases from introduced birds, a factor known to have triggered declines and extinctions in endemic Hawaiian birds. According to ecologist Anthony S. Cheke, this was the chief cause of the hoopoe starling's extinction; the species had survived for generations despite other threats.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{began moving}} troops to Brooklyn in early May, {{and there were}} several {{thousand}} of them there in a short time. Three more forts were under construction {{on the eastern side}} of the East River to support Fort Stirling, which stood to the west of the hamlet of Brooklyn Heights. These new fortifications were Fort Putnam (named for Rufus Putnam and not to be confused with the later Fort Putnam at West Point), Fort Greene (named for Nathanael Greene), and Fort Box (named for Major Daniel Box). They lay from north to south, with Fort Putnam farthest to the north, Greene slightly to the southwest, and Box slightly farther southwest. Each of these defensive structures was surrounded by a large ditch, <b>all</b> <b>connected</b> by a line of entrenchments and a total of 36 cannons (mostly 18-pounders).|$|E

25|$|The Panegyrici Latini in c. 297 is {{the last}} mention of the Frisii by that name.

The interpretation of these references to 'Frisians' as references to the ancient Frisii has occasionally been made.|$|E
