5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be <b>an</b> <b>understatement,</b> though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
25|$|To {{say that}} they have a key role to play is <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> Finance is {{connected}} to most, if not all, of the key business processes within the organization. It should be steering the stewardship and accountability systems that ensure that the organization is conducting its business in an appropriate, ethical manner. It is critical that these foundations are firmly laid. So often they are the litmus test by which public confidence in the institution is either won or lost.|$|E
25|$|Circulation {{levels of}} cash {{on a per}} capita basis, are reduced by 19.5% from the high in 2007 to 2012; and reduced by 41.1% from 2007 to 2015. The Riksbanken {{predicted}} that between 2012 and 2020, the amount of cash in circulation will decline by 20 to 50 percent. The prediction {{may prove to be}} <b>an</b> <b>understatement</b> as the decline has exceeded 20 percent from 2012 to 2015. Speculation about Sweden declaring all banknotes and coins invalid at some future date is widespread in the media with Björn Ulvaeus as a celebrity advocate of a cashless Sweden which he believes will result in a safer society because simple robbery will involve stealing goods that must be fenced.|$|E

50|$|Minnesota nice is {{the stereotypical}} {{behavior}} {{of people from}} Minnesota to be courteous, reserved, and mild-mannered. The cultural characteristics of Minnesota nice include a polite friendliness, an aversion to confrontation, <b>a</b> tendency toward <b>understatement,</b> <b>a</b> disinclination to make a fuss or stand out, emotional restraint, and self-deprecation. Critics have pointed out negative qualities, such as passive aggressiveness and resistance to personal change.|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} widespread critical acclaim, with some calling {{it one of}} the greatest heartbreaking music videos of all time.

500|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} game's size and length. With an {{estimated}} 30 hours in basic gameplay, IGN called it Rare's War and Peace. [...] "Big" [...] is <b>an</b> <b>understatement,</b> wrote GameFan, [...] "the adventure found within is mastodonic". Reviewers became frequently lost or distracted in its world. Critics highlighted the ingenuity of the boss battles, {{in particular the}} final battle against K. Rool, though the story's ending disappointed EGM. Critics found little entertainment in the multiplayer mode but praised the gameplay variety between the five characters. The controls also frustrated reviewers, between slow movement speed and camera angle issues. For example, characters who do not move during their attacks become vulnerable to encroaching enemies. Edge wrote {{that the lack of}} camera improvements over Banjo-Kazooie was inexcusable.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{summarised}} in Internet Bookwatch as [...] "ragmatic, insightful, rational, iconoclastic, informed and informative". It {{was described as}} [...] "thoughtful and thought-provoking, making it a welcome and highly recommended addition to personal and academic library Contemporary Ethics reference collections and supplemental reading lists." [...] In addition to a quote from Internet Bookwatch, Columbia University Press advertised Animal Rights Without Liberation with quotes from several academics working {{in the area of}} animal ethics. Philosophers Peter Singer and Paula Casal praised work for exposing a false dichotomy of animal rights versus animal welfare, both seeing the work as an important contribution to the literature for this reason. Francione, an advocate for an animal rights approach which does mandate liberation, was quoted as saying that [...] "It would be <b>an</b> <b>understatement</b> to say that I disagree with Cochrane but he does a fine job presenting the argument and his book will surely provoke debate and discussion." ...|$|E

500|$|Recorded {{in three}} months, As Daylight Dies was {{released}} on November 21, 2006 and peaked at number 32 on the Billboard 200 chart with 60,000 sales in its first week. [...] "As Daylight Dies" [...] proved {{to be one of}} their biggest albums yet. It also entered the Australian Albums Chart at number 29. Mixed by Dutkiewicz, the album received mostly positive reviews—Thom Jurek of Allmusic called it [...] "a Top Five metal candidate for 2006 for sure". Decibel Magazine contributor Nick Terry said [...] "To call As Daylight Dies addictive would be <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> That it outdoes its already impressive enough predecessor could almost go without saying". Cosmo Lee of Stylus Magazine commented [...] "the album is astonishingly badly sequenced", though he praised the album as being [...] "less emotionally heavy-handed, and a lot more fun". As of November 27, 2007, As Daylight Dies has sold more than 500,000 units in the US.|$|E
500|$|The band's follow-up, Even If It Kills Me (2007), was {{recorded}} in New York City with Eli Janney and Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne, and Ric Ocasek of the Cars. The group, though big fans of his work, were disappointed with Ocasek's role. [...] "He just confused me the whole time," [...] said Pierre later, who noted that {{he was afraid to}} disclose that the experience was a [...] "bum-out." [...] Pierre struggled with writer's block during the sessions and found himself writing lyrics while recording the songs, which he had never done before. The band was also worried their songs would not be catchy enough after their last album was so successful. During this time, Pierre's substance abuse nearly disbanded the group. [...] "I think it's <b>an</b> <b>understatement</b> to say it is tough to be tied to Justin's emotions," [...] Cain later remarked. Following completion of the album, Pierre entered a three-week rehabilitation program for alcohol and drug abuse. The band was apart for a six-week stretch in the summer of 2007, marking their longest break apart in five years. [...] "It might sound cliched, but we all had a chance to do some growing up," [...] said Cain.|$|E
500|$|Mortal Kombat has {{received}} critical acclaim. GameZone's David Sanchez considered describing Mortal Kombat as [...] "a fitting reboot for the series" [...] to be <b>an</b> <b>understatement,</b> as [...] "while offering plenty of nostalgia" [...] {{the game is}} also [...] "a major step up for the series". Andrew Reiner of Game Informer called it [...] "the best Mortal Kombat yet." [...] According to Mark Waltron of GameSpot, [...] "over-the-top, bloody, and bursting with content, Mortal Kombat {{is a return to}} form for the franchise." [...] IGN's Ryan Clements called it an [...] "amazing" [...] game that [...] "combines the novelty of extreme violence with a great fighting engine." [...] Neidel Crisan of 1UP.com stated it [...] "has simply set the standard for future fighting games to follow." [...] Eurogamer's Matt Edwards was more critical of the game, but added that [...] "to judge Mortal Kombat harshly simply because it isn’t the equal of BlazBlue or Street Fighter IV on a technical level would be unfair to what the game does right." [...] Brett Elston of GamesRadar was also more cautious in his review, stating it is [...] "a successful sequel that both reboots and redeems the wayward series, though it’s not a flawless victory." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a four-starred {{review for}} The Guardian, John Fordham said: [...] "Carroll's subtle pitching, tone {{colouration}} and jazz improviser's timing reinvent Here's to Life as <b>a</b> distilled <b>understatement</b> accompanied only by acoustic guitar; her earthiness is revealingly complemented by soft strings on Goodbye; and Mad About the Boy is so slow {{as to be}} prayer-like".|$|R
500|$|To {{say that}} Charles Keating {{is a complex}} man seems <b>a</b> gross <b>understatement.</b> Some see him as an {{aggressive}} man who got desperate when {{the real estate market}} bottomed out and crossed the line between [...] "business as usual" [...] and fraud.

40|$|Measured {{productivity}} growth increased substantially {{during the second}} half of the 1990 s. This paper examines whether this increase owes to an increase in the rate of technological change or whether it can be explained by non-technological factors relating to factor utilization, factor accumulation, or returns to scale. It finds that the recent increase in {{productivity growth}} does appear to arise from an increase in technological change. Cyclical utilization raised measured productivity growth relative to technology growth in the first part of the expansion, but lowered it subsequently. Factor adjustment leads to <b>a</b> steady-state <b>understatement</b> of technology growth by measured productivity growth. The understatement was greater in the second half of the expansion than the first. Changes in the distribution of inputs across industries with different returns to scale lead to <b>a</b> modest <b>understatement</b> in the growth in technology. Although the increase technological change is most pronounced in durable manufacturing, technological change also increased outside of manufacturing. ...|$|R
500|$|As {{the serial}} progressed, Pauline contends with {{a plethora of}} family upsets, which include many deaths—her mother Lou in 1988, brother Pete in 1993 and husband Arthur in 1996—as well as her elder son Mark's fatal battle with HIV. After a year long build-up, Mark is shown to reveal his HIV status to his stunned and devastated parents in an episode that aired on Boxing Day 1991, {{attracting}} 19million viewers. Wendy Richard has given her interpretation of Pauline's reaction to Mark's news: [...] "To say she was shell-shocked was <b>an</b> <b>understatement</b> and, not knowing enough about HIV, she and Arthur were worrying that their eldest son might die from AIDS at any moment." [...] The HIV plot had many ramifications for the character of Pauline, as she struggles {{to come to terms}} with her son's condition. It was also instrumental in raising public awareness about the illness, which was still the subject of much ignorance when EastEnders tackled it in 1991. When the storyline initially aired, more people went for a HIV test in Britain than at any other time. Wendy Richard commented: [...] "The storyline with Mark Fowler, when he announced he was HIV positive, was really well done. People have to be aware that HIV and AIDS are not exactly the same thing. The Minister of Health who was in power at that time wrote a letter complimenting us for the way that we had put the information across." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Tommy Garrett of Canyon News awarded Walton a [...] "Daytime Gold Standard" [...] for her portrayal. He stated: [...] "Walton played each {{scene in}} this “Bette Davis-like” {{emotional}} marathon of a week. How did Walton do it? With aplomb and greatness." [...] The following year, when Jill opened her own nail salon, Mike Jubinville, also of Zap2it, {{noted that the}} character had [...] "stepped into a time warp". Prior to being paired with Colin, Nekeeta Borden wrote that, [...] "Jill Foster Abbott (cough, cough) Fenmore’s (Jess Walton) Jimmy Choos must have crossed paths with a black cat, because she can’t find a good man to bless her somewhat shriveled heart." [...] Of the character's possible pairing with Colin, she added: [...] "I, for one, hope that Maria Arena Bell and Co. keep Colin in Genoa City and surprise us all by making him a dream lover for Jill. She is a multidimensional character {{with a lot of}} fire, and a great capacity to be soft and vulnerable. Goodness knows she’s been through the ringer. Can Jill find love with Colin, or will her newest dalliance lead to heartbreak?" [...] In 2013, Giddens wrote of Walton's portrayal throughout her run, stating: [...] "Unlike most soap opera recasts, where success or failure depends on chemistry with an opposite sex romantic lead, newcomer Jess Walton would sink or swim, based on her ability to connect with fellow female powerhouse Jeanne Cooper, who played Jill's bitter rival Katherine [...] "Kay" [...] Chancellor." [...] He also commended Walton and Cooper's portrayal of their characters' rivalry, [...] "To say Walton swam alongside Cooper would be <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> The two women did a backstroke even Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps would have to admire, during their 26 years as acting partners," [...] he wrote.|$|E

"Rosemary's Baby" [...] {{was named}} {{as one of}} the [...] "Top 11 TV Episodes of 2007" [...] by UGO, and ranked thirteenth on The Futon Critics list of [...] "the 50 Best Episodes of 2007"; both citing the Baldwin and Morgan therapy scene as the reason. Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide {{declared}} it as [...] "one of 30 Rock's best episodes ever" [...] He praised Carrie Fisher's guest appearance, but felt that Baldwin's role-playing during Morgan's therapy session stole the show. Bob Sassone of TV Squad felt that even though the plot was [...] "insane", the episode still managed [...] "to have a heart at its core". Sassone called the therapy scene [...] "one of the funniest scenes ... on TV this season". Robert Canning of IGN felt that the episode has [...] "great storylines to great guest stars", making it [...] "one of the best the series has produced so far". Canning called the therapy scene [...] "the best moment of the episode". [...] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] " [...] Between Carrie Fisher's delightfully bonkers guest role and Jack Donaghy's hijacking of Tracy Jordan's therapy session, this 2007 episode was so wrong. And so good." [...] In 2016 Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker described the episode as [...] "the keys-to-all-mythologies of female comedy", which A. O. Scott of The New York Times said [...] "may actually be <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> The character of Rosemary Howard certainly embodies the glories and contradictions of second-wave feminism, and Liz's ambivalence about her is a barbed and brilliant illustration of the anxieties of female comic influence". Scott added that given Lemon's depiction as a Star Wars fan, [...] "the casting of Ms. Fisher ... adds about 12 dimensions of meta".|$|E
50|$|Buttel {{interprets the}} poem {{as one of}} Stevens's {{attempts}} to approach the rhythms of prose, as part of <b>a</b> strategic <b>understatement</b> that moves into a poem in an offhand, 'anti-poetic' way.

2500|$|AIDS {{was seen}} as a disease of gay, White, North American men. And people were really afraid of it. There were no {{treatments}} available in the Caribbean at the time, so AIDS really was a death sentence. You had people with Kaposi's sarcoma, people with violent diarrhea, who were just wasting away and then dying in really horrible and traumatic ways. To call what was going on here [...] "stigma and discrimination" [...] was really <b>an</b> <b>understatement.</b> In the ghettos they were putting tires around people who had AIDS and lighting the tires on fire. They were killing gay people because they thought AIDS was contagious. It was a very extreme environment, and really horrible things were happening.|$|E

[...] Dolphy's mother, Sadie, who had fond memories of her son practicing in the studio in the backyard of their house, gave instruments that Dolphy had bought in France but never played to Coltrane, who subsequently played the flute and bass clarinet on several albums before his own death in 1967.|$|E
