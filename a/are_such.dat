5|$|Donkeys, like mules, need less {{protein and}} more fiber than horses. Although the donkey’s {{gastrointestinal}} tract has no marked differences in structure {{to that of}} the horse, donkeys are more efficient at digesting food and thrive on less forage than a similar sized pony. They only need to eat 1.5% of their body weight per day in dry matter. It is not fully understood why donkeys <b>are</b> <b>such</b> efficient digestors, but it is thought that they may have a different microbial population in the large intestine than do horses, or possibly an increased gut retention time.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{majority}} of those advocating a name change are Democrats, {{there is no indication that}} the issue is of any real significance in electoral decisions given that Native Americans <b>are</b> <b>such</b> a small percentage of the electorate and are not likely to influence the outcome of any election. There are only eight states where Natives make up greater than 2 percent of the population: Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. However, polls show a definite political difference in the opinion of the general public, with only 58% of Democrats opposing a name change versus 89% of Republicans. Statements by political figures have generally been expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action. There have also been non-binding resolutions advocating name change proposed in New Jersey and passed in Minneapolis, New York State and California.|$|E

5|$|For many years, Triceratops finds {{were known}} only from solitary individuals. These remains are very common; for example, Bruce Erickson, a {{paleontologist}} of the Science Museum of Minnesota, has reported having seen 200specimens of T. prorsus in the Hell Creek Formation of Montana. Similarly, Barnum Brown {{claimed to have}} seen over 500skulls in the field. Because Triceratops teeth, horn fragments, frill fragments, and other skull fragments <b>are</b> <b>such</b> abundant fossils in the Lancian faunal stage of the late Maastrichtian (late Cretaceous, 66mya) Period of western North America, it is regarded as among the dominant herbivores of the time, if not the most dominant herbivore. In 1986, Robert Bakker estimated it as making up 5/6ths of the large dinosaur fauna {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous. Unlike most animals, skull fossils are far more common than postcranial bones for Triceratops, suggesting that the skull had an unusually high preservation potential.|$|E

5|$|The Port of Split is {{the largest}} {{passenger}} port in Croatia and the third largest passenger seaport in the Mediterranean. The port {{is administered by the}} Port of Split Authority, and the primary concessionaires Trajektna Luka Split and Luka d.d. Split, as well as 11 secondary concessionaires awarded concessions to use the port facilities or provide services in the port. The primary concessionaires are operating the City Port Split and Vranjic-Solin basin area, respectively, with the secondary concessionaires active in Vranjic-Solin area of the port and the terminals based in Kaštela. The latter are Dalmacijacement, PROplin, Brodomerkur, Trast, Tehnospoj, Dujmovača, Žitni Terminal, INA, Profectus, Eko Kaštelanski Zaljev and OMV companies. Passenger and vehicle transit is handled by a number of carriers; however in 2009 Jadrolinija share of the passenger traffic volume reached 85%. In 2009, total passenger traffic volume reached 3,995,846 passengers, representing a 3.3% drop compared to the previous year. The port serves seven island ferry lines, and four additional passenger shipping lines connecting nearby islands. There <b>are</b> <b>such</b> transport links to the islands of Brač and Hvarcarrying up to 2,000 and 1,000 vehicles per day during tourist seasonsas well as to islands of Vis, Lastovo, Korčula, Šolta, Drvenik Veliki, Drvenik Mali, providing regular transport links for a large area. In 2009, the ferry lines carried annual average daily traffic of 1,698 vehicles. During the summer peak season, the volume increases to a total of 3,812 vehicles on average.|$|E

5|$|The {{similarity}} of these symbionts in the genus Cryptocercus {{to those in}} termites <b>are</b> <b>such</b> that these cockroaches have been suggested to be {{more closely related to}} termites than to other cockroaches, and current research strongly supports this hypothesis about their relationships. All species studied so far carry the obligate mutualistic endosymbiont bacterium Blattabacterium, with the exception of Nocticola australiensise, an Australian cave-dwelling species without eyes, pigment or wings, which recent genetic studies indicate is a very primitive cockroach. It had previously been thought that all five families of cockroach were descended from a common ancestor that was infected with B. cuenoti. It may be that N. australiensise subsequently lost its symbionts, or alternatively this hypothesis will need to be re-examined.|$|E
5|$|The spatial {{structure}} and {{positioning of the}} mirror's reflection <b>are</b> <b>such</b> that PhilipIV and Mariana appear to be standing on the viewer's side of the pictorial space, facing the Infanta and her entourage. According to Janson, {{not only is the}} gathering of figures in the foreground for Philip and Mariana's benefit, but the painter's attention is concentrated on the couple, as he appears to be working on their portrait. Although they can only be seen in the mirror reflection, their distant image occupies a central position in the canvas, in terms of social hierarchy as well as composition. As spectators, our position in relation to the painting is uncertain. It has been debated whether the ruling couple are standing beside the viewer or have replaced the viewer, who sees the scene through their eyes. Lending weight to the latter idea are the gazes of three of the figures—Velázquez, the Infanta, and Maribarbola—who appear to be looking directly at the viewer.|$|E
