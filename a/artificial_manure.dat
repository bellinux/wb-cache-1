40|$|In the {{preliminary}} studies {{carried out in}} the laboratory and greenhouse, very similar effects were exerted on the bacterial activities in the soil and on the yield of oats from the use of the variously prepared <b>artificial</b> <b>manures</b> and from the application of farm manure. Well-rotted farm manure had a much greater effect on carbon dioxide production in sand cultures than did the <b>artificial</b> <b>manures,</b> but some of the <b>artificial</b> <b>manures</b> produced as large an influence as did the fresh farm manure. The sweet clover manure had a distinct beneficial effect, and the straw manure also increased the carbon dioxide production. The greater influence of the well-rotted farm manure was undoubtedly due to the greater decomposition occurring in that material than in the <b>artificial</b> <b>manures.</b> The nitrification studies in sand cultures in the greenhouse indicated that nitrate accumulation was depressed by the additions of farm <b>manure</b> and <b>artificial</b> <b>manures,</b> there being just as great a depression from the farm manure in 71 / 2 and 15 ton applications as from the <b>artificial</b> <b>manures.</b> The nitrifying power of the sand cultures was increased by the treatments, the <b>artificial</b> <b>manures,</b> in some cases, having a greater effect than the farm manure. The straw-clover manure and the sweet clover manure showed a greater effect than the farm manure. Apparently the greater nitrification brought about by the treatments was followed by a greater assimilation and, hence, there was a lower content of nitrates at 11 dates of sampling. In this test the <b>artificial</b> <b>manures</b> and the farm manure seemed to have similar effects on nitrification, but the <b>artificial</b> <b>manures,</b> in some cases, had a greater stimulative influence on the oats grown than did the farm manure. In the nitrate assimilation experiment in the laboratory, the application of farm manure appreciably stimulated the development of the nitrate assimilating organisms in the Carrington loam. The oats straw and the straw manure brought about a greater stimulation, but the <b>artificial</b> <b>manures</b> in general showed a smaller stimulation on this group of organisms. It is apparent that the <b>artificial</b> <b>manures</b> had no greater influence in increasing nitrate assimilation than did farm manure. These results were confirmed by later tests in the greenhouse and in the field on the Carrington loam, but it was noted that those <b>artificial</b> <b>manures,</b> which were not so well decomposed when applied to the soil, stimulated these nitrate assimilating organisms more and the effects persisted in the soil for a longer period. In the greenhouse experiments on Carrington loam, the <b>artificial</b> <b>manures</b> and farm manure had very similar effects on nitrate production, and while the influence on nitrification was not quite so great at first, the later effects were greater than those produced by farm manure. The influence of the various manures was similar on the crop of oats grown in this test. Field experiments on the Webster loam in 1926 and 1927 and on the Carrington loam in 1928 and 1929 with variously prepared <b>artificial</b> <b>manures</b> in comparison with farm manure indicate that nitrate assimilation, nitrification, nitrate accumulation and the numbers of bacteria, molds and actinomycetes were very similarly affected by the additions of the various manures. The yields of corn were also influenced in a very similar way by the <b>artificial</b> <b>manures</b> and farm manure, altho in some instances there were differences in yields which were out of line with the general trend of the results. From the results as a whole it is apparent that the proper composting of straw and cellulose residues may permit the production of <b>artificial</b> <b>manures</b> which will give similar effects on bacteriological conditions in the soil and on crop yields to those occasioned by farm manure. There is a similar stimulation in the nitrification process and in the numbers of organisms, and while nitrate assimilation is also stimulated by the <b>artificial</b> <b>manures,</b> the influence on this process is no greater than that produced by farm manure. While, therefore, there may be a reduced content of nitrates in the soils following the addition of these <b>artificial</b> <b>manures,</b> there is no greater reduction than that brought about by farm manure. As farm manure has a well-known beneficial effect on crop growth, it is apparent that there need be no deleterious effect from well-decomposed <b>artificial</b> <b>manures</b> either on crop yields or on soil conditions in general. In fact it would seem that quite as large beneficial effects should be exerted, and any increase in nitrate assimilation and decrease in nitrate content is more than offset, from a crop production standpoint, by the increased nitrification which is occasioned...|$|R

50|$|In his autobiographical journal, ‘Ten Years of Gentleman Farming’, {{published}} in 1874, Lawson humorously alluded to his three big mistakes; {{the purchase of}} a steam plough; the procurement of low priced guano; and the elevation of his father's coachmen to the position of headman. All of these occurred upon his possession of Blennerhasset Farm in 1862; an estate his father had previously purchased for the sum of £17,000. The estate comprised 333 acre, and incorporated a water wheel, a group of cottages, and a number of derelict farm buildings. In the weeks before assuming control of the farm Lawson travelled extensively throughout Britain seeking agricultural advice, visiting many good farms and farming districts; particularly those that applied ‘model farming’ techniques. Lawson began a programme of improvement. He bought an additional 87 acre of land. He changed the title to the ‘Model Farm’, then to Mechi, and later back to the Blennerhasset Farm. He removed miles of unwanted fences, thousands of tons of stone, constructed miles of new roads, and drained the waterlogged land. Besides the farming scheme, he also established a market garden, <b>artificial</b> <b>manure</b> works, a laboratory, a free library, a free school, a gas works, a medical dispensary and several grocery stores. He also contracted the steam cultivator, and founded a flax business.|$|E
50|$|John Bennet Lawes {{was born}} at Rothamsted in modern-day Harpenden near St Albans, Hertfordshire, on 28 December 1814, the only son of John Bennet Lawes, owner of the Rothamsted estate and lord of the manor of Rothamsted. His father {{died when he was}} eight years old, so he was raised mostly by his mother Marianne. He was educated at Eton College and at Brasenose College, Oxford, {{although}} he didn't graduate. Even before leaving Oxford in 1832, Lawes had begun to interest himself in growing various medicinal plants on the Rothamsted estates, which he inherited from his father upon his death in 1822. Around 1837, he began to experiment on the effects of various manures on plants growing in pots, and a year or two later the experiments were extended to crops in the field in order to free farmers from relying on animals to produce fertilizer. In 1839, an ostrich belonging to him escaped Rothamsted and caused a bit of property damage, although the only person it hurt {{was the first one to}} try and capture it. In 1842, he patented a manure formed by treating phosphates with sulphuric acid, and thus initiated the <b>artificial</b> <b>manure</b> industry. In the succeeding year he enlisted the services of Joseph Henry Gilbert, with whom he experimented for more than half a century in raising crops and feeding animals, activities which have rendered Rothamsted famous to scientific agriculturists. In 1854, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, which in 1867 bestowed a Royal Medal on Lawes and Gilbert jointly, and in 1882 he was awarded the title of baronet. He died in 1900, passing his manor to his son Charles, and is buried in the churchyard of St Nicholas Church, Harpenden with his wife Caroline (née Fountaine) Lawes (1822-1895).|$|E

40|$|These {{experiments}} {{on the production}} of <b>artificial</b> farm <b>manure</b> show that a good grade of well-decomposed manure may be made by composting straw or corn stalks with certain chemicals, provided a sufficient supply of water is added to keep the compost heap moist. The addition of a proper amount of water {{is essential for the}} best decomposition of the materials and for the production of the best grade of manure. Decomposition was found to proceed somewhat faster in the laboratory than in the open, probably because of the more even temperature. The addition of small amounts of soluble nitrogen hastened the decomposition process in the open and also under controlled conditions in the laboratory or greenhouse, but was more effective when applied to composts in the open. The results obtained in the greenhouse indicate that too much aeration may be very undesirable in the making of <b>artificial</b> <b>manures,</b> decreasing the decomposition processes and causing a considerable loss in nitrogen. A certain degree of aeration, however, is very beneficial in the decomposition of various composts. A proper relationship between the amount of water and the aeration must be established and maintained to secure the best results. Inoculation of composts with fresh manure, soil, or cultures of molds may speed up the decomposition process. The results of the experiments carried out along this line, however, as reported here, indicate that with an even temperature, optimum moisture conditions and the best aeration, decomposition of composts prepared with various chemical reagents will proceed quite rapidly, and good <b>artificial</b> farm <b>manures</b> may be produced without any inoculation. It seems very desirable that some reagent supplying soluble nitrogen be employed in preparing composts from straw, corn stalks or other similar materials, in order to hasten the decomposition processes, and permit of the earlier production of a well-decomposed manure. Such a reagent will also increase the fertilizing value of the manure produced because of the nitrogen added. <b>Artificial</b> farm <b>manure</b> may be produced by composting straw and such materials without the addition of any reagents, but the process proceeds much slower and the manure formed is of less value when applied to the soil. These experiments show that a satisfactory <b>artificial</b> farm <b>manure</b> cannot be produced under average Iowa conditions without the addition of water. The average rainfall in Iowa will not provide sufficient moisture for optimum decomposition in the composts, nor for the production of a good grade of manure. For the production of <b>artificial</b> farm <b>manures</b> from oats straw, the addition of 800 to 1, 000 gallons of water per ton of straw is probably the best, giving most nearly optimum conditions of moisture, air and temperature in the compost. The method suggested in Missouri for composting by the use of a mechanical mixer attached to the thresher proved satisfactory, saving much time and labor in the preparation of the composts. The method involves little expense and is easily followed. When <b>artificial</b> farm <b>manures</b> are to be made on a large scale, it would certainly be desirable to follow the Missouri method. The tests with various chemicals indicate that any of the reagents used may be employed to advantage in preparing <b>artificial</b> <b>manures.</b> The maintenance of proper moisture and air conditions in the composts is apparently more important than minor variations in the reagents used, provided, of course, that they contain a satisfactory source of soluble nitrogen. In general the experiments which have been carried out in the open indicate that the production of <b>artificial</b> farm <b>manure</b> from straw or corn stalks is feasible on Iowa farms, provided the farmer is willing to spend the necessary amount of time and effort in preparing the composts. The expense involved need not be large, but, obviously, it will vary considerably according to the particular farm conditions and the equipment available. The cost of production must be kept at a minimum or the manure produced will not give profitable results. The practice of making <b>artificial</b> farm <b>manure</b> cannot be recommended for general farm use, but where conditions are favorable and the facilities are available at little cost, <b>artificial</b> farm <b>manure</b> may be produced which will be equal in value to farm manure and will serve to supplement the inadequate supply of that important fertilizing material...|$|R

40|$|With 14 {{chapters}} {{devoted to}} technical aspects and 8 chapters on social, economic and geographical studies, {{this was the}} first comprehensive historical study of agricultural development in a Dutch province. The study covered the period 1200 - 1900 and focused on the agricultural profession and the prosperity of farmer and farmhand, and not on juridical and political facets as was customary. In contrast to most other agricultural regions of Europe the closed village economy was non-existent through international trade and navigation. Weaving, breweries, madder factories and weekly markets grew up in the villages. New crops were introduced by the impulses of commerce: madder 1380, buckwheat 1485, potatoes, tobacco, hop, cabbage, Jerusalem artichoke in the 18 th century and mangold, sugar-beet, caraway, clover and lucerne in the 19 th century. Cereals, rape-seed, beans and peas were the ancient crops cultivated in a 7 years rotation. The lease period had the same duration. Agriculture was mainly crop growing on the 'wheat system', intensified by the cultivation of flax and madder, requiring deep tillage and abundant manure. Cattle raising was considered only as a necessary evil for getting manure. This agriculture occupied a prominent place in Europe, but measured by our standards the prosperity was unstable, the farmhands were poor and often unemployed. Up to 1870 the farmers were lacking initiative and there was a painful surplus of them and of their labourers.

40|$|Jannsen’s “Eesti Põllumees” (1868 - 1880) Johan Voldemar Jannsen holds {{a special}} {{role in the}} {{cultural}} history of Estonia — until 1875 {{the vast majority of}} Estonian periodicals were founded by Jannsen. Perno Postimees (1857 – 1863) and Eesti Postimees (1864 – 1880) that he edited were responsible for all the explanationand organisation work during the national awakening. Jakobson’s newspaper “Sakala” did not come into circulation until only 1878, while it took over all Jannsen’s subjects but wrote of them in a sharper manner. Greatly to him do we owe the myth of his competitor Jannsen’s turncoat nature. Jannsen did receive support from the Estonian and Livonian knightage and Society in 1870 – 1879 but this was first and foremost connected to the gentry’s attempts to presentthemselves as a supporter of the native’s cultural endeavours {{in the eyes of the}} locals and administration. In addition to the song festival and the organisation of song and music societies Jannsen attempted to found agricultural societies for the development of farmers’ skills and knowledge, while he also established a respective journal—Eesti Põllomees—that was published as a monthly supplement to the Baltische Wochenschrift, a journalissued by the Society. Hermann v. Samson, a versatile and difficult man, who organised support for Jannsen’s publications in Livonia and Estonia, was the official editor and most likely also the censor of the journal for the first half-year (1869). The newspaper was published on the first day of every month, the content was quite versatile and the illustrations in the style of wood engraving (author: Eduard Magnus Jakobson). The Society supported the publication with both subscriptions and financial contributions. The newspaper introduced practical methods of agriculture and animal husbandry, using manure and <b>artificial</b> <b>manure,</b> tending pastures, construction of farmhouses, nature protection issues, often in the form of a dialogue with the exemplary farmer Tiit from the farm of Niidu. After some time the content and regularity of publication of the newspaper began to decline. Jannsenbowed out from editing the paper in 1877, Põllumees transferred to the ownership of agricultural societies and was published regularly at first, providing accounts of the activities of the societies. However, already the next year ended with only a double issue (5 / 6) having been published and in 1879, no new issues came. In 1880 Jannsen commented that Põllumees had so to say returned to its father and the journal was published twice a month as a supplement of the EestiPostimees. At the end of the year Jannsen had a stroke and both Eesti Postimees as well as Põllumees went into decline. The last issue of the Põllumees was published in early 1889...|$|E

40|$|As a multi-functional machine {{the tractor}} {{is the central}} and basic {{innovation}} in agricultural production. The degree of its spread on private smallholdings can therefore serve {{as an indicator of}} innovativeness in Yugoslav agriculture in general. Since by its uses the tractor is functional for the entire farm and not exclusively for an individual person, this analysis takes the farm as the unit of adoption. As regards the achieved degree of innovativeness the author distinguishes only two categories of adoption units (i. e. farms) : non-adopters and adopters. The adoption of production innovations in agriculture proceeds under the influence of certain social, economic and psychological factors. Therefore, in order to establish certain basic aspects of the process of adoption of tractors in private agriculture, the author starts from the assumption that innovativeness will vary substantially according to the characteristics of the resepctive local community (i. e. village), the characteristics of the households and farms, and the characteristics of the heads of households. Of the contextual correlates of innovativeness the folowing characteristics of the local community were investigated: distance from the respective centre of gravity, infrastructural development, socio-political life, and the proportion of farmers in the village population. The analysis showed that only the characteristic »proportion of farmers in the village population« has the significant influence on the innovativeness of households. Of the structural correlates of innovativeness the following characteristics of households and farms were examined: size, socio-economic type and standard of the household, size of the farm, co-operation with the social sector, marketability of the farm production, existence of an agricultural heir, and adoption of certain technological innovations. Cross-tabulation showed that the tractor is adopted in a significantly higher degree by major households, full-time farming families, and households which are better equipped with labour-saving devices and installations, households with larger farms, marketable production, and developed co-operation with the social sector, and households which have an agricultural heir and which have already adopted certain technological innovations (selection wheat, hybrid maize, <b>artificial</b> <b>manure,</b> herbicides and pesticides). Of the analytical correlates of innovativeness the following characteristic of the heads of households were examined: sex, age, education, vocation, socio-political participation, discussions with members of the family of questions referring to the village and agriculture, reading of daily papers, listening to radio programmes, and watching TV programmes. Subsequent analysis showed that tractor adopters are, in a significantly high degree, households the heads of which are men (although the author does believe this to be due to sex difference per se) and heads of which are farmers by vocation who regularly follow TV programmes. Other hypothesized correlations were not found to be statistically significant...|$|E
40|$|Currently it is {{technically}} and economically feasible to convert animal manure into dischargeable water {{according to the}} Flemish legislation for discharge in surface waters (VLAREM). This {{can be achieved by}} the use of constructed wetlands (Innova Manure) following biological treatment or by intensive membrane filtration following biodigestion (for example Eneco Energy/Eco-Projects). This thesis is focussed on the further sustainability of both processes by creating a local ‘closed’ cycle of nutrients and water (cfr. ‘cradleto- cradle’). The first part of this thesis explores the reuse of nutrients originating from digestate processing. The post processing of digestate typically generates a wide range of derivatives, such as thick fractions coming from separation technologies, liquid concentrates coming from membrane filtration technologies and waste streams coming from gas scrubbers. These derivatives from digestate processing could potentially be used as a fertilizer, thereby providing an alternative for <b>artificial</b> <b>manure.</b> Though, research for the composition and the properties of these streams is required. In this thesis an exploratory examination was performed in aim to provide insights in the agricultural and economical value of these derivatives. Therefore these streams, all originating from the Eneco Energy/Eco-Projects biogas plants, were frequently sampled and physicochemically characterized. Our results show that mixing of the concentrate coming from first filtration steps with the thick fraction of the digestate and the further processing into a dry, pasteurized and phosphorous rich end product, is currently the most attractive option. Furthermore, a mix of the acidic water from gas scrubbers with the alkaline water and the concentrate coming from second filtration steps, could potentially be recognized as an ‘artificial manure’/’other fertilizer’. Further profound research is required to explore the most economically interesting digestate processing technologies, taking in account the physicochemical composition of the produced derivatives and their impact on soil structure, soil fertility and soil quality. The second and most important part of this thesis is focussed on the possibility to reuse the end water coming from manure and digestate processing. The increasing water shortage, the price-rise of tap water and the run-down of permissions for the use of subsoil water, makes water supply for agriculture {{one of the most important}} challenges for the near future. At present purified agricultural wastewater is only scarcely used on the farm or in the industry. The reliable reuse of dischargeable end water originating from manure and digestate processing for both low valuable applications (for example cleaning water, cooling water) and high valuable applications (for example potable water for the animals, irrigation water for the horticulture) could therefore add extra value to the Flemish agriculture both economically as ecologically. In this thesis the quality of the end water originating from five Innova Manure plants and two Eneco Energy/Eco-Projects biogas plants were characterized physicochemically and bacteriologically over a period of approximately one year. The variability of the quality in time as well as between different plants/processes were investigated and compared to the quality requirements for the different agricultural applications of water reuse. Bottlenecks in the upgrade to reusable water were indicated, relevant post processing technologies were lined up and experiments (lab, pilot and greenhouse) aimed at improving the quality of the effluents were set up. Quantitative insights were acquired by spreading a postal survey at the different Innova Manure plants. During the research period, the biogas plants were still in upgrade and could therefore not yet create a continuous and representative source of water. In contrast, constructed wetlands produced a continuous source of water with promising quality for both low valuable and high valuable applications. Carbon components, salts, total hardness and iron were the most important physicochemical bottlenecks in the upgrade to potable water. Bacteriological bottlenecks in the upgrade to potable water were Clostridium perfringens and sulphite reducing Clostridia. As the presence of recalcitrant organic material (COD) in the constructed wetlands effluent was considered as an important bottleneck for reuse, research was performed to reduce the COD thus improving the effluent quality. More specific a chemical experiment based on the use of calciumoxide (CaO), a biological experiment based on the use of submerged plants and a physical-biological experiment based on the use of aerobic bio-filters were performed. Based on our results, the CaOtreatment appears to be the most cost effective and reliable technique, because this product didn’t only cause a significant effect on COD, but also on the contents of magnesium, total hardness and iron. Based on all data obtained in the research period, the following path for reuse of the effluent as a potable water source for pigs has been proposed by way of a case-study for the Innova Manure site in Langemark: dilution of the effluent with the available open well water, treatment with CaO and last an acidic dosage for preventive hygienisation and pH-neutralization. Finally in this thesis also research was performed to investigate the potential use of Phragmites australis, originating from the harvesting of constructed wetlands, as a sustainable source of energy by biodigestion. Hereby it is important to notice that the use of biomass for digestion implies the transfer of nutrients and difficult biodegradable organic matter into the digestate. The digestate could then potentially be reused as a fertilizer/soil amendment, which again results in a ‘closed’ cycle of nutrients. The biogas production and the withdrawal capacity of P. australis have been explored on two different points in time, respectively based on biogas-batchtests and physicochemical characterization. P. australis showed a similar biogas production to energy maize and the biogas production and nutrient contents were significantly higher for an early harvest. Further research is however required to verify these results. Based on the ‘cradle-to-cradle’ principle, our results have shown that there are perspectives to reuse the end water originating from constructed wetlands, to digest the harvested biomass and to upgrade derivatives coming from digestate processing into fertilizers/soil amendments. This path should be investigated in the following research years...|$|E

Coal and other {{minerals}} accounted for around {{one quarter of}} the traffic in 1905, while goods carried in 1906 included fertiliser, burnt ore, flour and scrap metal. Commercial traffic continued into the 1970s, when tolls of £2,365 were collected on 28,169 tons of cargo. Traffic on the Driffield Navigation was relatively steady between 1871 and 1905, falling slightly from 35,654 to 32,666 tons. Goods carried included coal, linseed, cottonseed, wheat, flour and <b>artificial</b> <b>manures.</b> In 1922, £7 of income was received from pleasure craft using the navigation. Traffic declined during the 1930s, with commercial traffic finally ceasing in 1944. The Leven Canal carried 4,242 tons in 1888 and 4,546 in 1905, but then succumbed to road competition, and closed in 1935.|$|R
40|$|In {{the earlier}} papers {{dealing with the}} {{ecological}} characteristics of the salt water lagoon near Mandapam {{and the results of}} experimental fish culture in such areas, Tampi (1959 and i 960) indicated that certain intrinsic factors are responsible for restricting biological productivity of these environments. Since then some experiments in this field have been conducted to assess the basic productivity of the area. A few preliminary trials in the use of <b>artificial</b> <b>manures</b> have also been tried to test the response in any possible increase in biological production. The results, in conjunction with the hydrological factors, are broadly presented in this paper which may be significant while the problem of utilising salin€ coastal lagoons is receiving increased attention in our country. In this context, a reference to the pioneering work of Gross, Marshall and their collaborators in the United Kingdom during the years from 1944 to 1949 is of utmost significance. A good amount of subsequent work, although mainly done in fresh water ponds, have bearing on the present problem. These are indicated in the review by Mortimer (1954) and Maciolek (1954) ...|$|R

Secretary of the Urmston Allotments Association, near Manchester: [...] "Though the Urmston men had foremost in their mind the aim of producing payable crops ... they determined that their allotments should be convenient and comfortable to work, and pleasing to look upon.... It is a delusion often found among novices that ordinary ground {{takes a long time}} to get into decent order; and is an expensive business. But enlightened and energetic men working together can do wonderful things. They did them at Urmston. The ground was only broken up in March, 1916, but in the same season splendid crops of peas, potatoes and other vegetables were raised by the holders, the majority of whom had little or no previous experience of gardening.... So as to deal with the main needs of the members co-operatively in the most effective manner a Trading Committee was appointed to advise and make contracts.... Manure, lime, salt, and <b>artificial</b> <b>manures</b> have been ordered collectively; and seeds and other gardening requisites arranged for at liberal discounts." ...|$|R

"It is {{doubtful}} whether {{the replacement of}} German agriculture on a sound basis {{in the last ten}} years is to be ascribed in a greater measure to technical advance in agricultural methods, or to the development of the co-operative system. Perhaps it would be right to say that for the large farms it is due to the first, and for the smaller farms (three quarters of the arable land in Germany) to the second. For it is only through co-operation that the advantages of farming on a large scale are made possible for smaller farmers. The more important of those advantages are the regulated purchase of all raw materials and half-finished products (<b>artificial</b> <b>manures,</b> feeding stuffs, seeds, etc.), better prices for products, facilities for making use, in moderation, of personal credit at a cheap rate of interest, together with the possibility of saving and putting aside small sums of interest; all these advantages of the large farmer have been placed within the reach of the small farmers by local co-operative societies for buying, selling, and farming co-operatively, as well as by saving and other banks, all connected to central associations and central co-operative societies.|$|R

On them the farmers had rights of grazing, and of digging peat and turf. In Saxon areas in the eastern Netherlands these lands became common property (marches or commons, Du. marken), while in the south, {{under the influence of}} French law, the land became municipal property. Over the centuries they were reclaimed on a small scale; new settlements and villages grew up. From the beginning of the 19 th century the government encouraged reclamation and many thousands of hectares were sold, chiefly for forestation. In 1856, North Brabant had about 100, 000 ha and Limburg about half as much municipal waste land; figures in 1923 were 33, 000 and 12, 000 ha. <b>Artificial</b> <b>manures,</b> credit (Raiffeisenbanks) and education allowed the establishment of farms on sands {{at the end of the}} 19 th century. The farmers bought or rented areas of waste to enlarge their farms or to establish entirely new farms.

But the primâ facie evidence of it is overwhelming, and this factor has been the main burden of Mr. Hoover's well-considered warnings. A variety of causes have produced it;--violent and prolonged internal disorder as in Russia and Hungary; the creation of new governments and their inexperience in the readjustment of economic relations, as in Poland and Czecho-Slovakia; the loss throughout the Continent of efficient labor, through the casualties of war or the continuance of mobilization; the falling-off in efficiency through continued underfeeding in the Central Empires; the exhaustion of the soil from lack of the usual applications of <b>artificial</b> <b>manures</b> throughout the course of the war; the unsettlement of the minds of the laboring classes on the above all (to quote Mr. Hoover), [...] "there is a great fundamental economic issues of their lives. But relaxation of effort as the reflex of physical exhaustion of large sections of the population from privation and the mental and physical strain of the war." [...] Many persons are {{for one reason or another}} out of employment altogether. According to Mr. Hoover, a summary of the unemployment bureaus in Europe in July, 1919, showed that 15,000,000 families were receiving unemployment allowances in one form or another, and were being paid in the main by a constant inflation of currency. In Germany there is the added deterrent to labor and to capital (in so far as the Reparation terms are taken literally), that anything, which they may produce beyond the barest level of subsistence, will for years to come be taken away from them.|$|R
