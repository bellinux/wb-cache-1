40|$|Anticipating fisher {{behaviour}} {{is necessary}} for successful fisheries management. Of the different concepts {{that have been developed}} to understand individual fisher behaviour, random utility models (RUMs) have attracted considerable attention in the past three decades, and more particularly so since the 2000 s. This study aimed at summarizing and analysing the information gathered from RUMs used during the last three decades around the globe. A methodology has been developed to standardize information across different studies and compare RUM results. The studies selected focused on fishing effort allocation. Six types of fisher behaviour drivers were considered: the presence of other vessels in the same fishing area, tradition, expected revenue, species targeting, costs, and risk-taking. Analyses were performed using three separate linear modelling approaches to assess {{the extent to which these}} different drivers impacted fisher behaviour in three fleet types: fleets fishing for demersal species using <b>active</b> <b>gears,</b> fleets fishing for demersal species using passive gears and fleets fishing for pelagic species. Fishers are attracted by higher expected revenue, tradition, species targeting and presence of others, but avoid choices involving large costs. Results also suggest that fishers fishing for demersal species using <b>active</b> <b>gears</b> are generally more influenced by past seasonal (long-term) patterns than by the most recent (short-term) information. Finally, the comparison of expected revenue with other fisher behaviour drivers highlights that demersal fishing vessels are risk-averse and that tradition and species targeting influence fisher decisions more than expected revenue. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Stomach {{contents}} of three species of tuna, (Thunnus obesus, T albacares, T alalunga) commonly taken by longline, were studied during scientific cruises in Polynesia, South Pacific.

A comparison with observations of tuna caught by the most <b>active</b> <b>gears,</b> such as purse seine or gillnet suggest that only tunas with a low rate of stomach repletion are taken by longline. This suggestion leads to the hypothesis that the catch rate of longline fishing depends not only on tuna density, but also on the relative joint densities of prey and tuna, particularly in biologically heterogeneous environments. The consequences of such a hypothesis on the value of longline CPUE for indexing abundance of deep swimming tuna could be important...|$|R
40|$|Change in {{behaviour}} {{is usually}} the first response to human-induced environmental change and key for determining whether a species adapts to environmental change or becomes maladapted. Thus, understanding the behavioural response to human-induced changes is crucial in the interplay between ecology, evolution, conservation and management. Yet the behavioural response to fishing activities has been largely ignored. We review studies contrasting how fish behaviour affects catch by passive (e. g., long lines, angling) versus <b>active</b> <b>gears</b> (e. g., trawls, seines). We show that fishing not only targets certain behaviours, but it leads to a multitrait response including behavioural, physiological and life-history traits with population, community and ecosystem consequences. Fisheries-driven change (plastic or evolutionary) of fish behaviour and its correlated traits could impact fish populations well beyond their survival per se, affecting predation risk, foraging behaviour, dispersal, parental care, etc., and hence numerous ecological issues including population dynamics and trophic cascades. In particular, we discuss implications of behavioural responses to fishing for fisheries management and population resilience. More research on these topics, however, is needed to draw general conclusions, and we suggest fruitful directions for future studies...|$|R

Second, the difficulty with which floats are inserted on the float rope of the nets when they are used near the surface.

40|$|A flight {{dynamics}} evaluation {{was performed in}} order to analyse {{the ability to use}} the outer flap for roll control as well. Based on the A 350 flap system architecture, where the outer flap can be deployed independently from the inner flap by using an <b>active</b> differential <b>gear</b> box, two different concepts were identified as potentially benefitial for the desired purpose. In both concepts the inner ailerons were removed in order to save weight and system complexity and the outer flap performs (all speed) roll control together with the outer (low speed) aileron. Concept 1 comprises the usual flap geometry and the outer aileron, whereas concept 2 comprises an outer flap, which is extended in spanwise direction by the length of the inner aileron. The flight dynamic evaluation revealed that {{for the use of the}} outer flaps for regular roll control flap dynamics are necessary of at least 16 °/s flap deflection rate in order to fulfill requirements from certification specification CS- 25 and handling quality criteria. A system analysis showed that the existing <b>active</b> differential <b>gear</b> box from A 350 is unfortunately only able to deflect the flap with a maximum rate of 0. 43 °/s, or with slight modifications of the existing <b>active</b> differential <b>gear</b> box a maximum deflection rate of 1. 4 °/s could be feasible. These values showed to be insufficient for regular roll control. Nevertheless, in case of dual loss of hydraulic power the only available roll control could be performed by one remaining pair of ailerons, which are driven by an electrical back-up hydraulic actuator at the A 350. In order to still enable roll control, if these electrical back-up hydraulic actuators fail additionally, it was analysed whether the outer flap could be used as emergency roll control with the aforementioned feasible flap dynamics. The results showed that the handling qualities with this flap system ensuring roll control are barely controllable. However, it appears feasible to reach degraded but acceptable handling qualities if the system dynamics could be slightly increased...|$|R

Numerous studies have already sought to evaluate the risk level of this occupation through the analysis of the frequency and seriousness of occupational injuries. The purpose of the present study is to analyse these accidents in terms of two main characteristics of the vessels involved: the fishery type (high seas, offshore, coastal, or inshore fishery) and the fishing activity (use of passive or <b>active</b> <b>gears).</b> Materials and methods:Injury rates were calculated for the Brittany region and for the year 2012. A second analysis was carried out on 8, 286 reported injuries that occurred in France from 2002 to 2012, while vessels were in the process of fishing. Results:This first analysis shows that the incidence rate is very high (103 per 1, 000 full-time equivalent fishermen) and that it depends more on the fishery type than on the fishing activity; the highest rates concern the offshore and the coastal fleets. Results of the second analysis show that the nature of accidents depends more on the fishing activity than on the type of fishery. Conclusions:These findings lead to a discussion of the causes of the highest incidence rate values and the causes of the observed variations. The discussion also involves the methodological difficulties related to the incidence rate calculations...|$|R
40|$|The fishing {{industry}} in the Philippines was tantamount to a marine capture fishery in the 1950 s to 1960 s. Aquaculture and inland fishery production were not significant. Only during the 1970 s did aquaculture and inland capture fisheries contribute significantly to fish production. From 250 000 t fish production in 1951, this increased substantially to 1. 6 million t in the 1990 s. An average 4. 3 % was contributed by fisheries to {{the gross domestic product}} from 1988 - 98. Fisheries export earnings reached P 12 billion in the 1990 s. Exports of fishery products include tuna, shrimps, prawns and seaweed. Fishing industry employees in the Philippines are distributed thus: 70 % in the municipal (artisanal) sector, 25 % in aquaculture and 5 % in the commercial sector. Fish and fish products comprise more than 50 % of total animal protein intake vis-Î±-vis meat and meat products and poultry. However per capita consumption of food fish decreased from 40 kgâ•–year- 1 in 1988 to 36 kg in 1998. In the Philippines, small scale fishing is defined as fishing within municipal waters using fishing vessels of 3 GT or less, or fishing without vessels. In 1948, there were 63 005 fishers rising to 743 544 in 1995. There was a declining trend in catch per unit effort (CPUE) from 2. 10 tâ•–HP- 1 in 1948 to 0. 29 tâ•–HP- 1 in 1985. Time-series data from 1976 - 87 showed that small pelagics accounted for 38 % of total catch followed by demersals, 26 %; tuna, 16 %; seaweeds, 14 %; large pelagics, 6 % and invertebrates, 9 %. The most important fishing gear in terms of contribution to total catch are gillnets (30 %), hook and line (24 %) and beach seine (8 %). Hook and line accounts for almost 60 % of tuna catch while hook and line, gillnets, and fish corrals account for 60 % of demersal catch. Commercial fishing can be classified into: (a) small scale commercial fishing (fishing with passive or <b>active</b> <b>gear</b> and utilizing vessels of 3. 1 GT up to 20 GT); (b) medium-scale commercial fishing (fishing with <b>active</b> <b>gear</b> and utilizing vessels of 20. 1 GT up to 150 GT); and (c) large scale commercial fishing (fishing with <b>active</b> <b>gear</b> and vessels of more than 150 GT). In the 1950 s the three dominant types of gear were bag net, the trawl (including beam and otter types) and the round haul seine. The larger tonnage category (more than 100 GT) became more significant in the 1980 s. There are 35 species comprising 70 - 95 % of total commercial fish production grouped as demersals, small pelagics and large pelagics. Roundscads dominated the small pelagics, followed by slipmouth, a demersal species. Declining catches, disappearance of high value species and increasing volume of juveniles are indications that the fishery is biologically over-fished. This translates as declining profit for the fishery sector. It also means that the fishery employs excess labor and utilizes capital {{that could be used in}} other economic sectors.

For {{representing}} the coupling relationships among various correlate {{elements in the}} formation process of assembly qualities, the mapping relations between the structure domain and the quality domain was established {{on the basis of}} analyzing the hybrid structure assembly.

40|$|We {{reviewed}} {{the literature on}} incidental catches of pinnipeds by commercial fisheries using both passive and active fishing gear. Few incidental catch data were available for most species, although {{a substantial amount of}} information has recently become available for species in the North Pacific Ocean and the Northwest Atlantic Ocean off Eastern Canada. Incidental catches in passive gear appear to be of sufficient magnitude to have contributed to population declines of northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and Kuril seals (Phoca vitulina stejnegeri) in the North Pacific and harp seals (P. groenlandica) from the Barents Sea. Incidental catches in <b>active</b> <b>gear</b> appear at least partially responsible for the decline of northern sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in the North Pacific. Detrimental impacts of incidental catches are also indicated for New Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri) off the Auckland Islands, harbour seals (P. vitulina concolor) off Newfoundland and Alaska, grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in the eastern Baltic and for endangered Mediterranean (Monachus monachus) and Hawaiian (M. schauinslandi) monk seals. Several factors appear to influence incidental catches of pinnipeds, including behavioural traits of individual species, age of individuals, fishing gear type, and the temporal and spatial overlap of a species' range with fishing activities. More and better data on incidental catches of marine mammals (pinnipeds and cetaceans) and sea-birds by individual fisheries are required in order to evaluate properly the magnitude of the problems and their potential impact on specific populations...|$|E
