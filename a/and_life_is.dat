5|$|Don't Nod Entertainment SARL, doing {{business}} as Dontnod Entertainment (stylised as DONTИOD), is a French video game developer based in Paris. Founded in 2008, it started {{development on the}} action-adventure Remember Me (2013). Because of its poor return on investment, Dontnod resolved its financial situation with recourse to public funding to subsidise the graphic adventure Life Is Strange (2015). Momentum gained from the successful release of Life Is Strange was allocated {{to focus on the}} upcoming action role-playing game Vampyr (2018) <b>and</b> <b>Life</b> <b>Is</b> Strange 2 (TBA).|$|E
5|$|Coming to {{the palace}} {{at the center of}} Nil, they {{encounter}} the Emperor himself, who is revealed to be Elgo. Elgo explains to the party that he wished to use the crystals to achieve immortality, and predicted that the crystals, sensing his purpose, would split the world hoping to halt his plans. Elgo then utilized the power of Nil to move between the worlds and ensured that the Warriors collect the crystals in effort to restore the world so that he could achieve his goals. The Warriors and Elgo battle, with Elgo using the power of Nil against them. When he is defeated, Elgo loses control of Nil and it mutates him into a dark monster. The Warriors, seeing that Nil will ravage their world unchecked, fight the transformed Elgo and win. As Nil reverses its flow <b>and</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> returned to the world, all the Warriors flee, apart from Dusk and Alba, who are presumed dead. Soon however, they are revealed to be alive, saved by the spirits of Vata and the Mask. The game ends with the Warriors reunited, and the world and its crystal restored.|$|E

25|$|The latter {{contained}} the magical elements and love interest that were generally {{lacking in the}} more austere and warlike poems about Carolingian heroes. Ariosto continued to mix these elements in his poem as well as adding material derived from Classical sources. However, Ariosto has an ironic tone rarely present in Boiardo, who treated the ideals of chivalry much more seriously. In Orlando Furioso, instead of chivalric ideals, no longer alive in the 16th century, a humanistic conception of man <b>and</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> vividly celebrated under {{the appearance of a}} fantastical world.|$|E
25|$|We {{is set in}} the future. D-503, a {{spacecraft}} engineer, lives in the One State, an urban nation constructed almost entirely of glass, which assists mass surveillance.

With the aging population of Holocaust survivors, there has been increasing attention in recent years to preserving the memory of the Holocaust. The result has included extensive efforts to document their stories, including the Survivors of the Shoah project and Four Seasons Documentary, as well as institutions devoted to memorializing and studying the Holocaust, including Yad Vashem in Israel and the US Holocaust Museum. The historic tale of the Danish Jews fleeing to Sweden by fishing boat is recounted in an award-winning American children's novel.|$|E

The website Kotaku said this probably meant Square Enix was the publisher <b>and</b> <b>Life</b> <b>Is</b> Strange the game alluded to. Later that month, Square Enix announced , a three-part episodic title that launched for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 31 August 2017.|$|E
500|$|Louden {{says the}} team {{put a lot}} of work into the game's difficulty. They hoped that the time powers would let the player feel like a superhero, while still {{allowing}} for challenging moments. Learning from criticism of Alan Wake, they introduced several puzzles in order to increase variety and change the pace. The puzzles also serve to remind players of their arsenal of abilities. Some of the environmental puzzles, including the rewind feature, were inspired by titles like [...] <b>and</b> <b>Life</b> <b>Is</b> Strange, while the stutter sequences were inspired by Salvador Dali and Inceptions dream sequence.|$|E

In it she said [...] "I look back on my life like a good day's work, it was done and I feel satisfied with it. I was happy and contented, I knew nothing better and made {{the best out of}} what life offered. <b>And</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> what we make it, always has been, always will be."

500|$|Thatcher defined her own {{political}} philosophy {{in a major}} and controversial break with the one-nation conservatism of Edward Heath and her Conservative predecessors in an interview published in Woman's Own magazine, three months after her victory in the 1987 general election:I think we have gone through a period when too many children and people {{have been given to}} understand [...] "I have a problem, it is the Government's job to cope with it!" [...] or [...] "I have a problem, I will go and get a grant to cope with it!" [...] "I am homeless, the Government must house me!" [...] and so they are casting their problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first. It is our duty to look after ourselves and then also to help look after our neighbour <b>and</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> a reciprocal business and people have got the entitlements too much in mind without the obligations.|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} from Franz Josef Land in 1897, Bruce worked in Edinburgh as an {{assistant}} to his former mentor John Arthur Thomson, and resumed his duties at the Ben Nevis observatory. In March 1898 he received an offer to join Major Andrew Coats on a hunting voyage to the Arctic waters around Novaya Zemlya and Spitsbergen, in the private yacht Blencathra. This offer had originally been made to Mill, who was unable to obtain leave from the Royal Geographical Society, and once again suggested Bruce as a replacement. Andrew Coats {{was a member of the}} prosperous Coats family of thread manufacturers, who had founded the Coats Observatory at Paisley. Bruce joined Blencathra at Tromsø, Norway in May 1898, for a cruise which explored the Barents Sea, the dual islands of Novaya Zemlya, and the island of Kolguyev, before a retreat to Vardø in north-eastern Norway to re-provision for the voyage to Spitsbergen. In a letter to Mill, Bruce reported: [...] "This is a pure yachting cruise <b>and</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> luxurious". But his scientific work was unabated: [...] "I have been taking 4-hourly observations in meteorology and temperature of the sea surface [...] have tested salinity with Buchanan's hydrometer; my tow-nets [...] have been going almost constantly".|$|E

500|$|Discussing her own {{reaction}} to the storyline, Smith has commented; [...] "I was psyched. I {{thought it was a}} great idea." [...] She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; [...] "a lot of it is still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or something— there was something, but I don't think it's ever— I think it might be her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they did talk about their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, <b>and</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> change, then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world I imagine, if you all of a sudden thought that you might be in love with a woman and maybe you weren't before." ...|$|E
