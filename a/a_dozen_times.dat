5|$|Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore {{appeared}} in a bikini in An Evening in Paris (1967), a film mostly remembered for the first bikini appearance of an Indian actress. She also posed in a bikini for the glossy Filmfare magazine. The costume shocked the conservative Indian audience, but it also set a trend of bikini-clad actresses carried forward by Parveen Babi (in Yeh Nazdeekiyan, 1982), Zeenat Aman (in Heera Panna 1973; Qurbani, 1980) and Dimple Kapadia (in Bobby, 1973) in the early 1970s. Wearing a bikini put her name in the Indian press as one of Bollywood's ten hottest actresses of all time, and was a transgression of female identity through {{a reversal of the}} state of modesty, which functions as a signifier of femininity in Bombay films. By 2005, it became usual for actors in Indian films to change outfits <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>times</b> in a single song — starting with a chiffon sari and ending up wearing a bikini. But, when Tagore was the chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification in 2005, she expressed concerns about the rise of the bikini in Indian films.|$|E
5|$|During the Anarchy, Scotland invaded Northern England {{and took}} {{much of the}} land north of Durham. In the 1139 peace treaty that followed, Prince Henry of Scotland was made Earl of Northumberland and kept the {{counties}} of Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumbria. These reverted to English control in 1157, establishing {{for the most part}} the modern England–Scotland border. The region also saw violence during the Wars of the Roses, including the decisive Battle of Wakefield, although the modern-day conception of the war as a conflict between Lancashire and Yorkshire is anachronistic – Lancastrians recruited from across Northern England, including Yorkshire, while the Yorkists drew most of their power from Southern England, Wales and Ireland. The Anglo-Scottish Wars also touched the region, and in just 400 years, Berwick-upon-Tweed – now the northernmost town in England – changed hands more than <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>times.</b> The wars also saw thousands of Scots settle south of the border, chiefly in the border counties and Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|The emperor penguin's diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, although its composition varies from population to population. Fish {{are usually the}} most important food source, and the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) makes {{up the bulk of}} the bird's diet. Other prey commonly recorded include other fish of the family Nototheniidae, the glacial squid (Psychroteuthis glacialis), and the hooked squid species Kondakovia longimana, as well as Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The emperor penguin searches for prey in the open water of the Southern Ocean, in either ice-free areas of open water or tidal cracks in pack ice. One of its feeding strategies is to dive to around , where it can easily spot sympagic fish like the bald notothen (Pagothenia borchgrevinki) swimming against the bottom surface of the sea-ice; it swims up {{to the bottom of the}} ice and catches the fish. It then dives again and repeats the sequence about half <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>times</b> before surfacing to breathe.|$|E

25|$|While gliding occurs {{independently}} from powered flight, it {{has some}} ecological advantages of its own. Gliding is a very energy-efficient way of travelling from tree to tree. An argument made is that many gliding animals eat low energy foods such as leaves and are restricted to gliding because of this, whereas flying animals eat more high energy foods such as fruits, nectar, and insects. In contrast to flight, gliding has evolved independently many times (more than <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>times</b> among extant vertebrates), however these groups have not radiated {{nearly as much as}} have groups of flying animals.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the country}} was {{in the throes of}} the Great Depression, Strub's {{management}} and creativity brought success to his investors. He attracted Seabiscuit to the track, which helped to establish Santa Anita as a premier stop on the racing circuit. The first year dividend returned to investors 100% of their initial investment. By 1960 the aggregate par value of the stock ($7,500,000) had multiplied over <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>time</b> and grown so large that it split 375 to one.

25|$|Schwartz and Ballard were {{introduced}} to Keith Prater at the University of Texas chemistry department, and sold him {{on the idea of}} developing a new rechargeable lithium battery technology with them. Prater was able to quickly determine that no one knew what the product of the lithium-salt reactions in existing batteries were, and guessed that it was lithium dithionite, which he was able to synthesize. Working in a trailer, Ballard and Schwartz built a simple battery and Prater brought a sample of the lithium dithionite, and when they were placed together and charged, a weak current was produced. After further development the system was able to be recharged about <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>times.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Obergefell v.

The court's decision in Obergefell cited Loving nearly <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>times,</b> and {{was based on the}} same principles – equality and an unenumerated right to marriage. During oral argument, the eventual author of the majority opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy, noted that the decisions holding racial segregation and bans on interracial marriage unconstitutional (Brown v.

He advertised his business regularly in the golf magazines. In addition to his skill as a club maker, Low was a superb player. As of 1915 he had tied his own course record of 3-under-par 71 on the par 74 Baltusrol course no less than <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>times.</b> That same year he placed seventh in the 1915 U.S. Open held on his home course at Baltusrol.|$|E

25|$|On December 31, 1999, a {{powerful}} {{beam of light}} was unveiled for the first time. Called the Legacy Light or Skybeam, it is powered by lamps that total 85 million candela shining skyward {{from the top of}} the Space Needle to honor national holidays and special occasions in Seattle. The concept of this beam was derived from the official 1962 World's Fair poster, which depicted such a light source although none was incorporated into the original design. It is somewhat controversial because of the light pollution it creates. Originally planned to be turned on 75 nights per year, it has generally been used fewer than <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>times</b> per year. It did remain lit for eleven days in a row from September 11, 2001, to September 22, 2001, in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks.|$|E
25|$|The match {{ended with}} Honinbo Shusai winning by two points. However, his victory was {{surrounded}} by controversies. At {{the time of the}} match, the tradition dictated that the player holding white had the right to adjourn the game at any time, and there was no sealing of moves before adjournment. This meant that Shusai, being the nominally stronger player and thus holding white, could adjourn the match whenever {{it was his turn to}} move and continue deliberating at home before the match resumed. Shusai shamelessly abused this privilege by adjourning the game more than <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>times,</b> all at his turn to play. For instance, on the eighth day of the match, Shusai played first, and Go Seigen replied within two minutes, Shusai then thought for three and a half hours, only to adjourn the game. It was no secret that Shusai, during adjournments, discussed and studied the game with his students to come up with the best moves. Go Seigen was therefore put into an especially adverse position for having to take on the entire Honinbo establishment.|$|E
25|$|Charlotte's Jane Eyre, Emily's Wuthering Heights, and Anne's Agnes Grey, {{appeared}} in 1847 after many tribulations, again {{for reasons of}} finding a publisher. The packets containing the manuscripts often returned to the parsonage and Charlotte simply added a new address and did this at least <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>times</b> during the year. The first one was finally published by Smith, Elder & Co in London, of which the 23-year-old owner George Smith had been specialised until then in publishing scientific revues aided by his perspicacious reader, William Smith Williams and remained faithful to the family. Those of Emily and Anne were confided to Thomas Cautley Newby who intended to compile a three-decker, more economical for sale and for loan in the circulating libraries the two first volumes to include Wuthering Heights and the third one Agnes Grey. Both the novels attracted critical acclaim, occasionally harsh about Wuthering Heights, praised for the originality of the subject and its narrative style, but viewed with suspicion because of its outrageous violence and immorality – surely, the critics wrote, a work {{of a man with}} a depraved mind – fairly neutral about Agnes Grey, more flattering in spite of certain commentators denouncing it as an affront to morals and good mores, for Jane Eyre which soon became what would be called today a best-seller.|$|E
