40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{examine the impact of}} the foreign {{activities}} of firms on their international competitiveness. It addresses questions such as: to what extent and under what conditions can firms compensate for deteriorating location <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> their home country and maintain their lead in an industry through investment in foreign countries? Under what conditions can firms reap the benefits of a locationally advantageous foreign country? These questions are examined with reference to selected US professional service industries. The findings show that FDI weakens the link between the location <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> home countries and the ownership <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> firms, as it enables firms to develop advantages which are not directly related to the location <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> their home countries. However, this impact is very moderate, and is exercised through the indirect impact of FDI on the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> firms and countries. The ownership advantages which firms develop in their home countries are the most critical determinant of their competitiveness. ...|$|R
