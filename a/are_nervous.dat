25|$|Those {{who suffer}} from social anxiety {{disorder}} fear being judged by others in society. In particular, individuals with social anxiety <b>are</b> <b>nervous</b> {{in the presence of}} people with authority and feel uncomfortable during physical examinations. People {{who suffer from}} this disorder may behave a certain way or say something and then feel embarrassed or humiliated after. As a result, they often choose to isolate themselves from society to avoid such situations. They may also feel uncomfortable meeting people they do not know, and act distant when they are with large groups of people. In some cases, they may show evidence of this disorder by avoiding eye contact, or blushing when someone is talking to them.|$|E

500|$|Dre's {{handling}} of the production was praised by critics. AllMusic writer Stephen Erlewine stated: [...] "Dre realized that it wasn't time to push the limits of G-funk, and instead decided to deepen it musically, creating easy-rolling productions that have more layers than they appear". He added that the beats were [...] "laid-back funky, continuing to resonate after many listens". Rolling Stone writer Touré noted [...] "The Chronics slow, heavy beats were a sonic representation of angry depression as accurate as Cobain's feedback blasts; Doggystyle is leaner, with its high-tempo Isaac Hayes- and Curtis Mayfield-derived tracks". He {{went on to say}} that [...] "Most of Dre's hooks and nearly all his beats refuse to linger, as if the songs themselves <b>are</b> <b>nervous,</b> fearful of exposure, restless to get offscreen." [...] Entertainment Weekly magazine's David Browne mentioned that [...] "The mix of samples and live music on Dre's latest, The Chronic, gave it texture and depth, and he continues his knob-turning growth on Doggystyle, fluidly weaving together a gaggle of background singers and rappers, quirky samples, his trademark horror-flick keyboard lines". The Source magazine columinst wrote: [...] "Dre's brand of G-funk may be common now, but it is still painstakingly well-produced".|$|E
500|$|Springbok {{often go}} into bouts of {{repeated}} high leaps {{of up to}} [...] into the air – a practice known as pronking (derived from the Afrikaans pronk, [...] "to show off") or stotting. In pronking, the springbok performs multiple leaps into the air in a stiff-legged posture, with the back bowed and the white flap lifted. When the male shows off his strength to attract a mate, or to ward off predators, he starts off in a stiff-legged trot, leaping into the air with an arched back every few paces and lifting the flap along his back. Lifting the flap causes the long white hairs under the tail to stand up in a conspicuous fan shape, which in turn emits a strong scent of sweat. Although the exact cause of this behaviour is unknown, springbok exhibit this activity when they <b>are</b> <b>nervous</b> or otherwise excited. The most accepted theory for pronking {{is that it is}} a method to raise alarm against a potential predator or confuse it, or to get a better view of a concealed predator; it may also be used for display. Springbok are very fast antelopes, clocked at [...] They generally tend to be ignored by carnivores unless they are breeding. Caracals, cheetahs, leopards, spotted hyaenas, and wild dogs are major predators of the springbok. Southern African wildcats, black-backed jackals, black eagles, martial eagles, and tawny eagles target juveniles. Springbok are generally quiet animals, though they may make occasional low-pitched bellows as a greeting and high-pitched snorts when alarmed.|$|E

[...] Tom Gilatto of People Weekly lauded the first two episodes, calling them [...] "cinematically rich, full of sleek, oily pools of darkness." [...] In [...] The Denver Post, critic Joanne Ostrow said the series is [...] "Deeply cynical about human beings as well as politics and almost gleeful in its portrayal of limitless ambition." [...] She added: [...] "House of Cards is a wonderfully sour take on power and corruption." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most breeds {{with similar}} {{physical}} traits are bred {{for a single}} purpose, but the Drever has been bred to hunt all sizes of game, both hares and roe deer, and {{is also used to}} hunt fox and red deer. The Drever has a lot of stamina, and has become a popular hunting hound for deer hunters in northern Norway, Sweden, and Finland (in Finland drevers are not allowed in deer hunting yet, but it is used for hare and fox hunting). Roe deer <b>are</b> <b>nervous</b> quarry, and the hounds which are used to hunt them must move slowly, especially in areas where heavy snow can be expected in late autumn.

Unfortunately, Katherine gets caught in traffic, and the Keeleys begin wondering where [...] "Mrs. Coleman" [...] is. Suddenly, Albert enters, dressed and styled as a conservative middle-aged woman.
