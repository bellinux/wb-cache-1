Testing {{the model of}} fatigue fracture based on the joint consideration of boundary-value problem of fracture mechanics and damage kinetics problem of the continuum damage theory on {{the solution of the}} problem of the growth of a crack in a thin finite plate with stress concentrators under uniaxial <b>asymmetrical</b> high-cycle <b>loading.</b> Methodology/ approach. It is assumed that fatigue damage accumulation is the cause of crack motion. Two-stage process damage accumulation involves the incubation stage and crack propagation stage. This process is described by scalar parameter of damage ??[0; 1]. The condition of the damage parameter equality to 1 is taken as the criterion of the fatigue fracture front initiation and movement. It is assumed that main part of body is deformed linear-elastically while all non-linear effects are concentrated in plastic zones at the crack tip. According to presented model the fatigue crack increases step by step on the length of cyclic plastic zone. The lengths of plastic zones near crack tip are defined on base modified Dugdale model.

40|$|In {{practical}} power systems, it {{is normally}} impossible to maintain perfect balance or symmetry in phase voltages and currents. The {{diversity of the}} load, such as single phase, arc furnaces and railway, enhances the amount of unbalance or negative sequence components. Alongside <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>load,</b> further increase in negative sequence components is introduced due to the network inherent asymmetry i. e. untransposed transmission. Thus, they are usually excessive and exceeds standards at weak nodes in the network. Utilities and customers have to comply certain code agreements to limit the degree of negative sequence components in the network. This is because that negative sequence components cause deterioration to the network equipments. For instance, higher loss, torque oscillation, speed reduction and excessive rotor heat are undesirable obstacles to rotating machines. <b>Asymmetrical</b> <b>load</b> compensator can be based on passive elements, i. e. inductors and capacitors such as a Static Var Compensator (SVC), or a Voltage Source Converter (VSC) such as a Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM). The utilization of the negative sequence controller, an SVC or a STATCOM provides, gains a significant interest to most utilities around the globe. The compensators basically inject a different capacitive or inductive negative sequence current that has an opposite phase of the load negative sequence current. As a result, the network see symmetrical load and phase voltages and currents are balanced without exchanging active power between the network and the compensator. The thesis investigates {{the benefits of the}} SVC negative sequence controller to a network with a detailed description about the SVC characteristics and control components. The thesis also presents unbalance assessment methods implemented in practical networks during the planning stage. Moreover, drawbacks of negative sequence components to network apparatus i. e. rotating machines and transmission lines are summarized. The analysis is carried out using PSCAD for a simple network representation and IEEE 14 bus system. The result illustrates that the SVC allows utilities to balance asymmetrical loads to mitigate negative sequence components. The SVC response to balance <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>load</b> depends on load type, network strength and sources of unbalance. The SVC exhibits a very fast response to reduce the negative sequence components in extreme cases of unbalance such as asymmetrical short circuit. The SVC in general can mitigate negative sequence components caused by a sources connected in the same bus which means that the SVC provides local balancing only. Besides the negative sequence controller, the SVC enable a power factor correction by compensating for the reactive components of the load positive sequence current...|$|E

The low motor activity together with bad body position and gait {{are among the most}} important etiological factors for the appearance of abnormal spinal curvatures. For many decades, different authors have tried to uncover the secrets of spinal abnormalities and to find the best methods and tools for their early and secondary prevention. A unified set of methods for treatment of abnormal spinal curvatures in its conservative, orthopedic or surgical modalities is still nonexistent at the world scale. Many authors admit that <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>load,</b> weakness and easy fatigue of the neuromuscular system are the reason for the formation of flawed posture, which can serve as an unlocking mechanism for structural scoliosis [5, 6]. Others consider heredity to be an etiological factor [8, 9]. According to them, the predisposition to the disease is congenital, but the deformations appear as a result of excessive load. Good prevention of abnormal spinal curvatures requires a whole set of measures, applied in both home and school environments [3].

40|$|Abstract Background Proximal {{phalanges}} in {{horses are}} among bones {{that are most}} prone to injuries. So far, the detailed analysis of densitometric and geometric parameters of both front legs proximal phalanges in horses has not been investigated. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the densitometric and geometric parameters between proximal phalanges in equine both front legs with the use of peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Methods The study material comprised isolated both front legs proximal phalanges derived from 22 horses. The structure analysis of the proximal phalanges was conducted with the pQCT. The following bone parameters were determined: bone mineral content, volumetric bone mineral density, total bone area, trabecular area, cortical area, cortical thickness, periosteal circumference, endocortical circumference, Strength Strain Index. Tomographic analysis of proximal phalanges was conducted at three levels: at 15 %, 50 % and 85 % of the bone length. Results The statistical analysis showed that both the densitometric and geometric parameters of the bone at 50 % and 85 % of its length, did not present any statistically significant differences for the left or right proximal phalanges of the forelimb. At the same time, all examined parameters measured at 15 % of the bone length, in the vicinity of the proximal metaphysis revealed significant statistical differences between both front legs proximal phalanges. Conclusions The proximal phalanx parameters in the forelimbs are significantly different for the left and right proximal phalanx at 15 % of the length and they indicate higher Strength Strain Index of the left bone in this location. The densitometric and geometric parameters of the bone at 50 % and 85 % of its length, did not present any statistically significant differences for the left or right proximal phalanges of the left and right forelimbs. The most serious changes caused by <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>load</b> of the thoracic limbs in horses occur near the proximal metaphysis, where the spongious substance is most abundant. This may happen because the metabolism of the spongious bone tissue is eight times faster compared to the compact bone tissue.

40|$|Maintaining {{balance is}} a central problem for new walkers. To examine how infants cope with the {{additional}} balance control problems induced by load carriage, 14 -month-olds were loaded with 15 % of their body weight in shoulder-packs. Both symmetrical and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>loads</b> disrupted alternating gait patterns and caused less mature footfall patterns. Walking was most severely compromised by back loads. Infants with less walking experience, lower levels of walking proficiency, and chubbier body proportions were more adversely affected. In addition, infants displayed a unique postural response to <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>loads.</b> In contrast to older children and adults, infants leaned with loads {{rather than in the}} opposite direction to the loads. Findings are discussed in terms of development from accommodation to compensatory strategies. Nearly as soon as infants can stand and walk, they complicate the problem of maintaining balance by carrying loads. They carry objects in their hands, hold them under their arms, and lift them overhead. In a standing posture, balance is easiest to control when the body’s center of mass is maintained squarely over the base of support (Winter, 1995). In walking, the body’s center of mass moves outside the base of support.

40|$|Name on Graduation Programme: Bassey-Duke, Elizabeth MissanBackground: Agriculture plays a {{vital role}} in the economy of any industrially {{developing}} country, including South Africa. In the Eastern Cape of South Africa citrus farming is a significant contributor to the local economy (Johnson et al., 2005). The harvesting phase of citrus farming is performed manually and exposes workers to physical risks, which can lead to the development of musculoskeletal disorders. In particular, the standard harvesting bag comprises of a single shoulder strap and promotes <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>load</b> carriage which results in shoulder and lower back pain complaints. The current study compared the physiological (EMG), perceptual (RPE), usability (PUEU) and productivity effects of two new harvesting bag designs (a hip belt and a backpack bag design) to the standard harvesting bag design. This was performed in a laboratory as well as a field setting. Methods (Laboratory phase) : 36 participants (12 males and 24 females) were assigned to one worker group. The “tall ladder worker” group was comprised of only males and the “step ladder worker” and “ground worker” group of females. Each participant was required to simulate a citrus harvesting task while utilizing each of the bag designs on different days. On each day/test session, participants performed three harvesting cycles. Muscle activity was measured throughout the entire testing session and RPE were recorded {{at the end of each}} cycle. Results (Laboratory phase) : The EMG and RPE results indicate that the backpack design was the most ideal design to reduce asymmetry, while the standard harvesting bag design was the worst. Although not significant, there was greater muscle asymmetry (p= 0. 109) and a significantly higher perceived exertion when using the standard bag (p= 0. 0004), in comparison to using the backpack. Methods (Field phase) : 17 Xhosa-speaking citrus harvesters (6 females and 11 males) participated in this study. Each harvester worked with one of the three bag designs on a different day. Productivity of each worker was assessed every hour by recording the number of bags filled with fruit and at the end of the shift. A Perceived Usefulness & Ease of Use questionnaire was presented to each participant to obtain feedback on worker acceptance to the new bag designs. ii Results (Field phase) : A general trend in support of the hip belt bag design over the other two bag designs were found, even within the different worker demographic groups (age, sex and worker experience). The workers perceived less exertion (7. 98 ± 1. 86) and were more productive (9. 90 ± 2. 11 bags/hour) when using the hip belt design; they also found this bag the most useful (1. 02 ± 0. 09) and easy to use (1. 07 ± 0. 25). In contrast, the backpack bag design had significantly poorer responses when compared to the other two bag designs and this was evident in all the dependent variables assessed (RPE, productivity and PUEU). Conclusion: The results from the laboratory phase supported the expectation that the backpack bag design reduces asymmetry and hence, is more suitable than the standard harvesting bag. However, results from the field show that the hip belt bag design was the most preferred and the backpack was the least preferred. Bao & Shahnavaz (1989) highlight the need for ergonomics researcher to convey laboratory findings into the field context. However, as shown by the current study, there are numerous challenges associated with field work, making it difficult for laboratory findings to be successfully conveyed to the field. Limitations and Recommendations: For the laboratory phase of the project, no biomechanical and cardiovascular responses were assessed. However, for a holistic approach, these variables should be considered in future studies. Due to high variability from one harvesting cycle to another, more than three harvesting cycles should also be performed to accurately replicate the harvesting process as done in the field over extended durations of time. For the field phase, data should be collected from more than one citrus farm and thus a larger sample size could be obtained. This would improve the validity of the study. In addition to this, data should be collected for a full working day, especially if environmental conditions are not a hindrance, as well as for a whole season, since workloads vary, depending on the time of the harvesting season...|$|E

40|$|The aetiology, {{in terms}} of both {{initiation}} and progression, of the deformity in idiopathic scoliosis is at present unclear. Even in neuromuscular cases, the mechanisms underlying progression are not fully elucidated. It is thought, however, that <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>loading</b> is involved in the progression of the disease, with evidence mainly from animal studies and modelling. There is, however, very little direct information as to the origin or mechanism of action of these forces in the scoliotic spine. This review describes the concept of intervertebral disc pressure or stress and examines possible measurement techniques. The biological and mechanical consequences of abnormalities in these parameters are described. Future possible studies and their clinical significance are also briefly discussed. Techniques of pressure measurement have culminated in the development of 'pressure profilometry', which provides stress profiles across the disc in mutually perpendicular axes. A hydrated intervertebral disc exhibits mainly hydrostatic behaviour. However, in pathological states such as degeneration and scoliosis, non-hydrostatic behaviour predominates and annular peaks of stress occur. Recent studies have shown that, in scoliosis, high hydrostatic pressures are seen with asymmetrical stresses from concave to convex sides. These abnormalities could influence both disc and endplate cellular activity directly, causing asymmetrical growth and matrix changes. In addition, disc cells could be influenced via nutritional changes consequent to end-plate calcification. Evidence suggests that the stress environment of the scoliotic disc is abnormal, probably generated by high and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>loading</b> of non-muscular origin. If present in the scoliotic spine during daily activities, this could generate a positive feedback of cellular changes, resulting in curve progression.

To achieve a preferable solution to current coupling effect in the VSC-based three-phase three-line system, a discrete-time decoupled current control strategy is proposed in the paper. With integration of the α-β transform and two independent current controllers, the proposed methodology can effectively implement decoupled {{control of the}} three-phase currents, which can thereby eliminate the impact from the neutral-point voltage especially under <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>loading</b> conditions. Control performance under digital realization was characterized with extensive tests on a shunt active power filter (SAPF) platform. Both the simulative and experimental results have demonstrated that the SAPF could function well and thereby verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed current control methodology...|$|R

Introducing {{the concept of the}} dividing line, the critical charge for heavy-ion-induced upset of memory cells can be calculated considering symmetrical as well as <b>asymmetrical</b> capacitive <b>loads.</b> From the critical charge, the upset-rate per bit-day for static RAMs can be estimated...|$|R
40|$|Power {{electronic}} controllers {{are employed}} in the transmission and distribution levels of the power systems. In transmission level applications, Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) controllers, consist of shunt and series static compensators, are applied for power flow control, stability enhancement, voltage regulation and power oscillation damping. A Static Var Compensator (SVC) is a shunt-connected FACTS controller that is able to exchange reactive power with the power system in a controlled way. The SVC {{can be used for}} load balancing applications to reduce negative sequence components in the network to an acceptable level. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the dynamic performance of the SVC negative sequence controller. The benefits of the SVC negative sequence controller and characteristics is presented. The simulation illustrates that the SVC allows utilities to balance <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>loads</b> to mitigate the network negative sequence components...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- To {{fulfill the}} {{challenging}} {{demands of the}} growing grid, new concepts of the inverters are needed. In this project a reduced switch modular inverter design is detailed. A reduced switch modular inverter design is presented for a modern power system which inputs power from both AC and DC Renewable Sources. The modular inverter is the combination of both three phase inverter and three phase inverter with the neutral point and it supports both symmetrical and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>loads.</b> Power Electronics Inverter is the key component to couple the two different renewable energy sources such like solar and wind. The converter is the combination of Cuk – SEPIC converters, the input from the source can be either buck or boost or stabilized at a particular value, the inductor in those converters provides the function filter reducing harmonics...|$|R
