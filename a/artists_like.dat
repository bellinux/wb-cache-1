5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, soul music was {{influenced}} by psychedelic rock and other styles. The social and political ferment of the times inspired <b>artists</b> <b>like</b> Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield to release album-length statements with hard-hitting social commentary. <b>Artists</b> <b>like</b> James Brown led soul towards more dance-oriented music, which eventually evolved into funk.
