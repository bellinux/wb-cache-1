40|$|Too often critics treat <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist {{brand and}} voice, {{its claim to}} stick up for the little guy as a gimmicky type of charlatanism {{that is used to}} convey simple and {{misleading}} news stories. However, in this dissertation, I demonstrate how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist journalistic style is in fact a sophisticated and complex form of political communication, one that requires great performative skill to embody, a deep knowledge of traditional political discourses, and an astute awareness of the key social and cultural cleavages active in a given historical moment. To capture the complexity of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist mode of address, in this study, I conduct a critical-textual analysis of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top three programs during the late- 2000 s Recession : Glenn Beck, Hannity, and The O'Reilly Factor. This involves a close reading of the "imagined community" <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> style is designed to address and how its style is crafted to create a political identity for viewers. While partisan identification with the Republican Party and political conservatism defines the broadest parameters of Fox's imagined community, the real power and ideological utility of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> mode of address, I argue, derive from its cultural referents, particularly, how it aligns deep moral values and social archetypes from the American populist rhetorical tradition with the political right, marking populism as conservative. In {{the first half of this}} dissertation, I develop a theoretical model for interpreting <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> unique populist address, which includes an analysis of how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top programs attempt to draw symbolic linkages between political conservatism and the white working- class. In the second half of the dissertation, I demonstrate the power of this rhetorical approach by showing how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top programs framed news about the late- 2000 s Recession to fashion a conservative economic agend...|$|R

The amount paid to the women filing the complaints was estimated at $13 million.

The Simpsons also often includes self-referential humor. The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting.

MacCallum stated that the game [...] "leaves nothing to the imagination" [...] and features the ability for players to [...] "engage in full graphic sex." [...] Self-proclaimed psychology specialist Cooper Lawrence and video game journalist Geoff Keighley were also interviewed. Lawrence described sexual content in video games as teaching their active users to consider women as objects of desire valued solely for their sexuality. She added that the game's player character {{is a man who}} decides how many women he wants to be with. Keighley focused on challenging the accuracy of her statements and asked her if she actually played the game, to which she responded [...] "No".

Additional reasons given by Hayes ten months after the departure include [...] "They didn't pay me enough", and [...] "They weren't that nice". In late 2007, reports emerged claiming that Hayes was in no condition to stay, because of a stroke he suffered in January. According to <b>a</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>News</b> article, Hayes' agent Christina Kimball, herself a practicing Scientologist, was the source of the statements that Hayes quit South Park. Stone lent support to this view in a 2007 interview with Rolling Stone, commenting that [...] "There are reports that Isaac had a stroke and Scientology quit the show for him, and I believe it... It was a brutal, up-close, personal thing with Isaac. If you look at the timeline, something doesn't add up."

[...] Fox News reporter Carl Cameron {{said there was no}} reason to believe the Israeli government was implicated, but that [...] "a classified top-secret investigation is underway". [...] A March 2002 story by Le Monde recapped the Fox report and concluded: [...] "Comverse is suspected of having introduced into its systems of the 'catch gates' in order to 'intercept, record and store' these wire-taps. This hardware would render the 'listener' himself 'listened to'." [...] Fox News did not pursue the allegations, and in the years since, there have been no legal or commercial actions of any type taken against Comverse by the FBI or any other branch of the US Government related to data access and security issues. [...] While no real evidence has been presented against Comverse or Verint, the allegations have become a favorite topic of conspiracy theorists.|$|E
50|$|Channel 60 {{signed on}} in 1991 as WYVN, <b>a</b> <b>Fox</b> affiliate. <b>A</b> <b>news</b> {{department}} was quickly set up, and offered more news than other {{stations in the}} area. However, Flying A Communications, the owner, found itself in financial trouble, due to this local news commitment and relatively poor ratings (partially caused by its location on cable, which was higher than other stations), leading to the station shutting down two years later, in 1993, after a sale to Benchmark Communications (who would have converted the station to a CBS affiliate for Winchester, Virginia, and Hagerstown, Maryland, under the WUSQ-TV callsign) fell through. A few months later, WYVN returned as an independent station, owned by Green River. The station tried to restore some local programming (including the newscast and a new talk show hosted by Gay Dawson), but further financial trouble caused this era to also end up being short-lived, abruptly ending in 1994.|$|R
