[...] On 14 April 2012 (the 100th anniversary of the ship's sinking), the wreck of the Titanic became eligible for protection under the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage. In the same month, Robert Ballard, the wreck's discoverer, announced a plan to preserve the wreck of the Titanic by using deep-sea robots to paint the wreck with <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>paint,</b> to help keep the wreck in its current state for all time. The proposed plan that Ballard announced has been outlined in a documentary made to time with the Titanic's 100th sinking anniversary called Save the Titanic With Bob Ballard where Ballard himself talks about how this proposed paint job on the wreck will work. Ballard says that he proposed to robotically clean and repaint the Titanic with a colour scheme mimicking rusticles because he saw [...] "original <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>paint</b> on the ship's hull, which was still working even after 74 years on the seabed" [...] when he visited the Titanic in 1986.|$|E

40|$|Recently, <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>paints</b> {{which does}} not include the poison {{components}} such as tin(Sn), copper(Cu) have been increasingly developed in order to inhibit the environmental contamination of the sea water. Moreover, the wear ratios of these <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>paints</b> are very important problem to prolong their life time in economical point of view. In this study, five types of <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>paints</b> as self polishing type were investigated on the relationship between their polarization characteristics and wear ratios. It was verified that there was apparently a good relationship between the wear ratio and polarization characteristics, for example, the wear ratio increased with increasing the impedance ratio, and increased or decreased with the corrosion potential shifting in the negative or positive direction respectively. In addition, the wear ratio decreased with decreasing the corrosion current density. Consequently, it is suggested that we can qualitatively expect the wear ratio by only measuring the polarization characteristics. Therefore, before the examination of the wear ratio was actually carried out in th...|$|R

At each farm samples of sediment and fish tissue (muscle, liver and gills) were analysed for heavy metal concentrations. The results showed that while total copper and zinc concentrations in sediments were quite similar in samples collected from the 4 farms, the extractable copper concentration in sediment from farms using anti-fouling treatment was 2 to 3 times higher than from those using untreated nets. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences for either metal between sediment samples from farms using anti-fouling treatment and those which did not, except for extractable copper concentrations. However, analysis of the biological samples showed that copper concentrations in muscle tissue were lower in samples from farms using untreated nets, with the highest copper concentrations being observed in fish livers from farms using <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>paints.</b> General linear model results indicated significant differences between heavy metal concentrations in fish samples from farms using antifouling paints and those which did not.

This species appears to survive as 'pure' colonies forming distinct black zones on the rock. Maculalactone A may provide K. maculans with a chemical defense against several marine organisms, including the common grazer, Chlorostoma argyrostoma and settlement by larvae of the barnacles, Tetraclita japonica, Balanus amphitrite and Ibla cumingii. The natural concentration of maculalactone A varied with season and also with tidal height on the shore and although a strong positive linear correlation was observed between maculalactone A concentration and herbivore grazing pressure, manipulative experiments demonstrated that grazing pressure was not directly responsible for inducing the biosynthesis of this metabolite. The potential of maculalactone A as a 'natural' marine anti-fouling agent (i. e. {{as an alternative to}} environmentally-damaging copper- and tin-based <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>paints)</b> was investigated after achieving a gram-scale synthesis of this compound.

The metal panels treated with various paints were set up at three marine zones, which were beneath the sea water surface at 1. 5 meters depth, the intertidal zone, and above the sea water surface. The composition, the preparation and the painting condition of anti-corrosive <b>paints</b> and <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>paints</b> were shown in Tables 1 - 7. The results of tests were given in Tables 8 - 10, Figs. 1 - 6, and Photos. 6, 7. The most effective <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>paints</b> were firstly AF 5, AF 4 and secondly AF 10, AF 9. Anti-corrosive paints which had much anti-corrosion effects were an epoxy resin anti-corrosive <b>paint.</b> The <b>anti-fouling</b> effect did not coincide with the anti-corrosion effect in these paints. The paint which had both effects was E 4 or E 5 and this was an epoxy resin anti-corrosive paint coated with a vinyl chloride resin paint which contains tributyl tin fumarate, copper oleate or pentachlorophenol cupric salt, and organoarsenic compound.
