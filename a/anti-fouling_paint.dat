[...] On 14 April 2012 (the 100th anniversary of the ship's sinking), the wreck of the Titanic became eligible for protection under the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage. In the same month, Robert Ballard, the wreck's discoverer, announced a plan to preserve the wreck of the Titanic by using deep-sea robots to paint the wreck with <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>paint,</b> to help keep the wreck in its current state for all time. The proposed plan that Ballard announced has been outlined in a documentary made to time with the Titanic's 100th sinking anniversary called Save the Titanic With Bob Ballard where Ballard himself talks about how this proposed paint job on the wreck will work. Ballard says that he proposed to robotically clean and repaint the Titanic with a colour scheme mimicking rusticles because he saw [...] "original <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>paint</b> on the ship's hull, which was still working even after 74 years on the seabed" [...] when he visited the Titanic in 1986.|$|E

40|$|Recently, <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>paints</b> {{which does}} not include the poison {{components}} such as tin(Sn), copper(Cu) have been increasingly developed in order to inhibit the environmental contamination of the sea water. Moreover, the wear ratios of these <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>paints</b> are very important problem to prolong their life time in economical point of view. In this study, five types of <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>paints</b> as self polishing type were investigated on the relationship between their polarization characteristics and wear ratios. It was verified that there was apparently a good relationship between the wear ratio and polarization characteristics, for example, the wear ratio increased with increasing the impedance ratio, and increased or decreased with the corrosion potential shifting in the negative or positive direction respectively. In addition, the wear ratio decreased with decreasing the corrosion current density. Consequently, it is suggested that we can qualitatively expect the wear ratio by only measuring the polarization characteristics. Therefore, before the examination of the wear ratio was actually carried out in th...|$|R

At each farm samples of sediment and fish tissue (muscle, liver and gills) were analysed for heavy metal concentrations. The results showed that while total copper and zinc concentrations in sediments were quite similar in samples collected from the 4 farms, the extractable copper concentration in sediment from farms using anti-fouling treatment was 2 to 3 times higher than from those using untreated nets. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences for either metal between sediment samples from farms using anti-fouling treatment and those which did not, except for extractable copper concentrations. However, analysis of the biological samples showed that copper concentrations in muscle tissue were lower in samples from farms using untreated nets, with the highest copper concentrations being observed in fish livers from farms using <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>paints.</b> General linear model results indicated significant differences between heavy metal concentrations in fish samples from farms using antifouling paints and those which did not.

This species appears to survive as 'pure' colonies forming distinct black zones on the rock. Maculalactone A may provide K. maculans with a chemical defense against several marine organisms, including the common grazer, Chlorostoma argyrostoma and settlement by larvae of the barnacles, Tetraclita japonica, Balanus amphitrite and Ibla cumingii. The natural concentration of maculalactone A varied with season and also with tidal height on the shore and although a strong positive linear correlation was observed between maculalactone A concentration and herbivore grazing pressure, manipulative experiments demonstrated that grazing pressure was not directly responsible for inducing the biosynthesis of this metabolite. The potential of maculalactone A as a 'natural' marine anti-fouling agent (i. e. {{as an alternative to}} environmentally-damaging copper- and tin-based <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>paints)</b> was investigated after achieving a gram-scale synthesis of this compound.

The metal panels treated with various paints were set up at three marine zones, which were beneath the sea water surface at 1. 5 meters depth, the intertidal zone, and above the sea water surface. The composition, the preparation and the painting condition of anti-corrosive <b>paints</b> and <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>paints</b> were shown in Tables 1 - 7. The results of tests were given in Tables 8 - 10, Figs. 1 - 6, and Photos. 6, 7. The most effective <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>paints</b> were firstly AF 5, AF 4 and secondly AF 10, AF 9. Anti-corrosive paints which had much anti-corrosion effects were an epoxy resin anti-corrosive <b>paint.</b> The <b>anti-fouling</b> effect did not coincide with the anti-corrosion effect in these paints. The paint which had both effects was E 4 or E 5 and this was an epoxy resin anti-corrosive paint coated with a vinyl chloride resin paint which contains tributyl tin fumarate, copper oleate or pentachlorophenol cupric salt, and organoarsenic compound. [著者抄録]本試験は厳しい条件下での暴露にもかかわらず、すぐれた結果が得られた。とくに防汚効力では有機スズと有機ヒ素および有機銅化合物を配合した薬剤が効果的であり、ついで 50 %亜酸化銅配合のものであった。防食効果はこれらの防汚効果と一致せず、塗膜の劣化状態と密接な関係にあった。波浪、光、酸素をどの影響が強く、それらの耐候性を必要とする干満帯での防錆塗料はエポキシ樹脂防錆塗料が効果的であり、海中浸漬ではタールウレタン系がやや効果的であった。防汚効果、防食効果いずれにも効果的配合はE 4 であり、トリプチルチンフマレートに有機ヒ素 1 T- 67 、オレイン酸銅配合のもので、エポキシ樹脂防錆塗料である。大気暴露試験では 2 年間の経過では、ほとんどのものは異常をきたさず、耐候性、防食性がすぐれており、ひき続き試験中である。本試験ですぐれた結果が得られたのは、基材の調整(みがき軟鋼板) 、塗装回数(5 回) 、膜厚(150 ～ 500 μ) 、ほぼ均一な塗装 (ピンホールが少ない) 、腐食促進因子(亜硫酸ガス、窒素酸化物など) の欠除などの寄与も無視できない。このことは逆に基材調整と塗装が適正であれば、塗膜の防食耐久性は存分に発揮されることを意味し、長期防食性を期すには塗料やその仕様の選択と同時に基材の十分な調整と入念な塗装が必要である。とくに本実験の主目的である冷却水用海洋構造物の防食防汚対策としての塗装には、構造表面のある程度の乾燥が必要であり、水分の除去とその塗装技術が重要な問題となってくる。この問題の解決のためには一例として構造物の内面に陸上で完全に塗装された金網(ある一定の大きさの網目で一定量の薬剤が流出するように工夫される) を内張して取替えるなどがあり、今後その点の施工上の研究が必要であると考える...|$|R
