40|$|A small-signal {{amplifier}} {{with two}} identical JFETs in Darlington pair is proposed and qualitatively analyzed {{perhaps for the}} first time. Unlike CS-JFET amplifiers, the voltage gain of this amplifier is significantly higher than unity. In addition, this amplifier can also be tuned in the specific range of audible frequency extended from 90 Hz to 19 KHz. Tuning performance makes this amplifier suitable to use in Radio and TV receivers. An <b>additional</b> <b>biasing</b> resistance RA, ranging in 3 KΩ to 1 MΩ, is to be essentially used in the proposed circuit to maintain its voltage/current amplification property. With this <b>additional</b> <b>biasing</b> resistance, the proposed amplifier crops considerably wide bandwidth (12. 365 MHz), significantly high current gain (530. 909) and fairly high voltage gain (9. 108) in 1 - 80 mV input signal range at 1 KHz frequency. These properties offer a flexible application range to the proposed amplifier as high power gain, wide band, or tuned amplifier in permissible audio-frequency range. Variations in voltage gain {{as a function of}} frequency and different biasing resistances, temperature dependency of performance parameters, bandwidth and total harmonic distortion of the amplifier are also perused to provide a wide spectrum to the qualitative studie...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new dual-frequency precise point positioning (PPP) model, which combines GPS and BeiDou observations. Combining GPS and BeiDou observations in a PPP model offers more visible satellites to the user, {{which is expected}} to enhance the satellite geometry and the overall PPP solution in comparison with GPSonly PPP solution. However, combining different GNSS constellations introduces <b>additional</b> <b>biases,</b> which require rigorous modelling, including GNSS time offset and hardware delays. In this research, ionosphere-free linear combination PPP model is developed. The <b>additional</b> <b>biases,</b> which result from combining the GPS and BeiDou observables, are lumped into a new unknown parameter identified as the inter-system bias. Natural Resources Canada’s GPSPace PPP software is modified to enable a combined GPS/BeiDou PPP solution and to handle the newly introduced biases. A total of four data sets at four IGS stations are processed to verify the developed PPP model. Precise satellite orbit and clock products from the IGS-MGEX network are used to correct both of the GPS and BeiDou measurements. It is shown that a sub-decimeter positioning accuracy level and 25 % reduction in the solution convergence time can be achieved with combining GPS and Bei-Dou observables in a PPP model, in comparison with the GPS-only PPP solution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{investigates the}} use of tone {{reservation}} for optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission in a short-range, intensity-modulated, direct-de-tected (IM/DD) optical channel. Due to the unipolarity of the IM/DD channel, any asymmetric clipping of the bipolar OFDM signal and associated nonlinear distortion will result in an un-favorable dc power and signi¿cant performance penalty. Using {{a detailed analysis of}} the clipping distortion, we propose a new framework to enable IM/DD optical OFDM transmission, where certain subchannels are reserved to produce a negative peak cancellation (NPC) signal via a frequency-domain digital ¿lter.
