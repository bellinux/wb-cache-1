2500|$|The {{timeline}} {{and events}} proposed above follows that reported by royal chronicler Ruy de Pina. However, Frei João Álvares, {{who was an}} eyewitness to the battle, places the dates and events on a somewhat different timeline. [...] Álvares reports that Tangier was assaulted immediately {{on the first day}} the expeditionary force arrived (September 13), a second assault within a couple of days (14th or 15th). The first attack by a Moroccan relief army is placed on the 16th, another the next day (17th), before the larger set piece encounter in the valley and the sally by the Tangier garrison (September 19). Álvares reports a third failed assault (Pina's second) on Tangier on September 20. [...] The arrival of Abu Zakariya's army and the battle of Tangiers is dated on September 25. [...] The second Moroccan assault on the siege camp on Sep. 26th, and the first emissaries sent by the Portuguese to the Marinid camp right after. The 7-hour assault of the siege camp is dated Sep. 28, with the opening of talks in the aftermath. Two more Moroccan assaults (Oct 1 <b>and</b> <b>Oct</b> 3) are reported, before the truce finally holds. [...] The finalization of the agreement and swapping of the hostages occurs on October 16 and signing of treaty on October 17.|$|E

60|$|No, my dear Norris, I don't go abroad--I go on May 1st {{into the}} depths (somewhere) of old England. A {{response}} to that proposal I spoke to you of (from Rome) is utterly impossible to me now.... I've two novels to write before I can dream of anything else; and to go abroad is to plunge into the fiery furnace of people. So either Devonshire or some other place will be my six months' lot. I must take a house, this time--a small and cheap one--and I must (deride me not) be somewhere where I can, without disaster, bicycle. Also I must be a little nearer town than last year. I'm afraid these things rather menace Torquay. But it's soon to say--I must wait. I shall decide in April--or by mid-March--only. Meanwhile things will clear up. I'm intensely, thank heaven, busy. I will, I think, send you the little magazine tale over which (I mean over whose number of words--infinite and awful) I struggled so, in Sept. <b>and</b> <b>Oct.</b> last, under your pitying eye and with your sane and helpful advice.

60|$|Aug., Sept., <b>and</b> <b>Oct.,</b> '63.--I am in {{the habit}} of going to all, and to Fairfax seminary, Alexandria, and over Long bridge to the great Convalescent camp. The {{journals}} publish a regular directory of them --a long list. As a specimen of almost any one of the larger of these hospitals, fancy to yourself a space of three to twenty acres of ground, on which are group'd ten or twelve very large wooden barracks, with, perhaps, a dozen or twenty, and sometimes more than that number, small buildings, capable altogether of accommodating from five hundred to a thousand or fifteen hundred persons. Sometimes these wooden barracks or wards, each of them perhaps from a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet long, are rang'd in a straight row, evenly fronting the street; others are plann'd so as to form an immense V; and others again are ranged around a hollow square. They make altogether a huge cluster, with the additional tents, extra wards for contagious diseases, guard-houses, sutler's stores, chaplain's house; in the middle will probably be an edifice devoted to the offices of the surgeon in charge and the ward surgeons, principal attaches, clerks, &c. The wards are either letter'd alphabetically, ward G, ward K, or else numerically, 1, 2, 3, &c. Each has its ward surgeon and corps of nurses. Of course, there is, in the aggregate, quite a muster of employes, and over all the surgeon in charge. Here in Washington, when these army hospitals are all fill'd, (as they have been already several times,) they contain a population more numerous in itself than the whole of the Washington of ten or fifteen years ago. Within sight of the capitol, as I write, are some thirty or forty such collections, at times holding from fifty to seventy thousand men. Looking from any eminence and studying the topography in my rambles, I use them as landmarks. Through the rich August verdure of the trees, see that white group of buildings off yonder in the outskirts; then another cluster half a mile {{to the left of the}} first; then another a mile to the right, and another a mile beyond, and still another between us and the first. Indeed, we can hardly look in any direction but these clusters are dotting the landscape and environs. That little town, as you might suppose it, off there on the brow of a hill, is indeed a town, but of wounds, sickness, and death. It is Finley hospital, northeast of the city, on Kendall green, as it used to be call'd. That other is Campbell hospital. Both are large establishments. I have known these two alone to have from two thousand to twenty-five hundred inmates. Then there is Carver hospital, larger still, a wall'd and military city regularly laid out, and guarded by squads of sentries. Again, off east, Lincoln hospital, a still larger one; and half a mile further Emory hospital. Still sweeping the eye around down the river toward Alexandria, we see, to the right, the locality where the Convalescent camp stands, with its five, eight, or sometimes ten thousand inmates. Even all these are but a portion. The Harewood, Mount Pleasant, Armory-square, Judiciary hospitals, are some of the rest, and all large collections.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To compare {{retinal nerve}} fiber layer (RNFL) and macular {{thickness}} measurements obtained with the Stratus {{optical coherence tomography}} (<b>OCT)</b> <b>and</b> OPKO/OTI <b>OCT</b> devices. METHODS: Included {{in the study were}} 59 eyes of 30 participants. All measurements for each eye were done on the same day with both devices. Student’s paired t-tests were used to compare the central macular thickness and RNFL measurements of the Stratus <b>OCT</b> <b>and</b> OPKO/OTI <b>OCT.</b> Pearson correlation was used to assess the relationship between the devices. Coefficient of variation (COV) was calculated to assess intersession repeatability. RESULTS: Using both the Stratus <b>OCT</b> <b>and</b> OPKO/OTI <b>OCT,</b> respectively, the measured mean average RNFL thicknesses were 98. 9 ± 11. 1 µm and 115. 1 ± 9. 6 µm (P= 0. 001), and the measured mean central retinal thicknesses (CRT) were 196. 2 ± 18. 8 µm and 204. 5 ± 21. 1 µm (P< 0. 001). Measured by the two devices, the RNFL thickness values were correlated in all quadrants, as were the retinal thickness values except the inferior outer sector. COV for average RNFL and CRT thickness were 2. 9...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} optical coherence tomography (<b>OCT)</b> <b>and</b> optical coherence microscopy (OCM) for imaging of benign and malignant thyroid lesions ex vivo using intrinsic optical contrast. 34 thyroid gland specimens are imaged from 17 patients, covering a spectrum of pathology ranging from normal thyroid to benign disease/neoplasms (multinodular colloid goiter, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and follicular adenoma) and malignant thyroid tumors (papillary carcinoma and medullary carcinoma). Imaging is performed using an integrated <b>OCT</b> <b>and</b> OCM system, with < 4 [micrometer] axial resolution (<b>OCT</b> <b>and</b> OCM), <b>and</b> 14 [micrometer] (<b>OCT)</b> <b>and</b> < 2 [micrometer](OCM) transverse resolution. The system allows seamless switching between low and high magnifications in a way similar to traditional microscopy. Good correspondence is observed between optical images and histological sections. Characteristic features that suggest malignant lesions, such as complex papillary architecture, microfollicules, psammomatous calcifications, or replacement of normal follicular architecture with sheets/nests of tumor cells, can be identified from <b>OCT</b> <b>and</b> OCM images and are clearly differentiable from normal or benign thyroid tissues. With further development of needle-based imaging probes, <b>OCT</b> <b>and</b> OCM could be promising techniques to use for the screening of thyroid nodules and to improve the diagnostic specificity of fine needle aspiration evaluation...|$|R
