5|$|<b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> have {{reported}} an age-related decline in dopamine synthesis and dopamine receptor density (i.e., {{the number of}} receptors) in the brain. This decline {{has been shown to}} occur in the striatum and extrastriatal regions.C]DOPA |journal=Life Sciences |volume=79 |issue=8 |pages=730–736 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2006.02.017 |pmid=16580023 }} Decreases in the D1, D2, and D3 receptors are well documented. The reduction of dopamine with aging is thought to be responsible for many neurological symptoms that increase in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> {{investigated}} {{sending a}} Gemini spacecraft onto a circumlunar trajectory. Many {{of the proposals}} made for this involved a double-launch architecture, with the Gemini spacecraft rendezvousing with an upper stage in orbit. Upper stages that were considered included the Transtage, {{the second stage of}} a Titan II, four different types of Centaur, including the S-V variant developed for the Saturn I, the Agena-D, an enlarged Agena, and two Agenas burning in parallel. Either a Titan or Saturn IB would have been used to launch the upper stage, whilst the Gemini would launch on the Titan II, as it had in the Gemini program.|$|E
5|$|Although effective, the B-52 was {{not ideal}} for the {{low-level}} role. This {{led to a}} number of aircraft designs known as penetrators, which were tuned specifically for long-range low-altitude flight. The first of these designs to see operation was the supersonic F-111 fighter-bomber, which used variable-sweep wings for tactical missions. Similar aircraft also emerged for other users as well, notably the BAC TSR-2, and later, Panavia Tornado and Sukhoi Su-24. <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> on a strategic-range counterpart followed.|$|E
5|$|Found on or {{near the}} bottom, the blackmouth {{catshark}} favors a muddy habitat. There is little evidence for segregation by sex. <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> in the northern and western Mediterranean have reported that adults occur deeper than juveniles. Other studies though have found no such pattern. It is possible that areas such as the waters off southern France offer a habitat suitable for sharks of all ages. Another explanation with some scientific support is that adults are most common at intermediate depths, while young sharks are restricted to shallower water and both adults and juveniles are found in deeper water. If true, the age-depth inconsistencies observed from previous research could have resulted from incomplete depth sampling.|$|E

Another Growing Greener grant, this one for $68,225, was given to Marple Township for a streambank stabilization project on the creek. Additionally, a $1000 grant from the Pennsylvania Watershed Restoration Assistance Program was given to Delco Anglers and Conservationists for riparian improvement of the creek and several other creeks. In 1997, a $60,000 grant was given to the Darby Creek Valley Association and DelCo Anglers and Conservationists for developing a conservation plan. The grant was provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Darby Creek Valley Association is an organization whose purpose is to preserve and improve the creek's watershed. It has approximately 100 members.|$|E
5|$|From 1945 onwards, Britain {{conducted}} <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> {{into the}} properties {{and use of}} variable geometry wings. The noted British engineer and inventor Sir Barnes Wallis began exploring the concept during the Second World War and became an early pioneer and advocate for the variable geometry wing, conceiving of an aircraft consideration that lacked conventional features such as a vertical stabiliser and rudder, instead using variable geometry wings to provide primary controllability in their place. In 1946, Wallis published a paper upon this research, which was quickly hailed as being a major scientific breakthrough in the aviation industry. Wallis proceeded to advocate {{for the production of}} an aircraft, military or civil, that would take advantage of a variable geometry wing. The Ministry of Supply and Ministry of Defence arranged for a series of tests to demonstrate the application of the technology to projectiles, both for research purposes and a potential form of anti-aircraft defence; while Wallis worked upon this research programme, he continued to promote the concept of a manned variable geometry aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{intercourse}} is {{the major}} mode of HIV transmission. Both X4 and R5 HIV {{are present in the}} seminal fluid, which is passed from a male to his sexual partner. The virions can then infect numerous cellular targets and disseminate into the whole organism. However, a selection process leads to a predominant transmission of the R5 virus through this pathway. In patients infected with subtype B HIV-1, there is often a co-receptor switch in late-stage disease and T-tropic variants appear that can infect a variety of T cells through CXCR4. These variants then replicate more aggressively with heightened virulence that causes rapid T cell depletion, immune system collapse, and opportunistic infections that mark the advent of AIDS. Thus, during the course of infection, viral adaptation to the use of CXCR4 instead of CCR5 may be a key step in the progression to AIDS. <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> with subtype B-infected individuals have determined that between 40 and 50 percent of AIDS patients can harbour viruses of the SI and, it is presumed, the X4 phenotypes.|$|E
