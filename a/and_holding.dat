There is evidence that the nail may help a bird to grasp things; species which use strong grasping motions to secure their food (such as when catching <b>and</b> <b>holding</b> onto a large squirming frog) have very wide nails. Certain types of mechanoreceptors, nerve cells that are sensitive to pressure, vibration or touch, are located under the nail.|$|E
