American mycologist Charles Horton Peck, who described it in the 1894 Annual Report of the New York State Botanist, named it Peziza Dudleyi after its discoverer. Peck noted a physical resemblance to P.aurantia (now known as Aleuria aurantia) and P.inaequalis, and said {{that it could be}} distinguished from those species by its yellow hymenium and larger spores. Several mycologists have considered the species to be synonymous with S.coccinea. However, as was later pointed out by Harrington (1990), [...] "the importance of fresh material for species diagnosis, especially for noting <b>ascospore</b> guttulation, cannot be overstated. Although I had examined material (dried herbarium specimens) from western North America I was not prepared to recognize that group as a species distinct from the two, large eastern North American species until I saw fresh (living) material." [...] As is the case with many fungi, microscopic differences between similar species can only be accurately determined by examining fresh material. Harrington analyzed herbarium specimens and fresh material of North American specimens of [...] "S.coccinea", and found that both S.dudleyi and S.austriaca were commonly misidentified. These results echoed a similar 1984 analysis of European specimens, performed by Hans-Otto Baral.|$|E

40|$|The Ascomycota fungus Microcyclus ulei is a {{major threat}} for natural rubber production. The <b>ascospores</b> {{play a major role}} in the {{survival}} and dissemination of the fungus. The present study indicates that the <b>ascospores</b> are present on the leaves shortly after infection. Although their abundance is higher on leaflets 50 – 70 days after they reach maturity, <b>ascospores</b> are still found on 6 months-old leaves, ensuring the survival of the fungus during the dry season in the case of no defoliation of the rubber trees. Indeed, their viability does not depend on the age of the leaf.

50|$|Simultaneously, <b>ascospores</b> are {{produced}} on the lesions of infected canes or berries {{left on the}} trellis system or on the vineyard floor {{to carry out the}} infection. These <b>ascospores</b> are formed in asci, which are in cavities within a stroma—the dense structural tissue that produces fruiting bodies in fungi—of pseudothecium. Pseudothecium of grape anthracnose, the sexual fruiting body of the fungus, has asci containing eight four-celled <b>ascospores.</b> The fungus also overwinters as pseudothecium, but the importance of <b>ascospores</b> in disease development is not clearly understood. The study done by Mirica (1998) validated that the <b>ascospores</b> do germinate and infect the tissue and produce the Sphaceloma phase which shows the existence of the perfect stage of Elsinoe Ampelina. Overall, conidia and <b>ascospores</b> overwinter on the ground and on infected tissue and become the source of primary inoculum.|$|R
50|$|L. maculans {{has both}} a teliomorph phase (<b>ascospores)</b> and an anamorph phase (pycnidia). The disease spreads by wind born {{dispersal}} of <b>ascospores</b> and rain splash of conidia.

The disease is polycyclic in nature even though the conidia are not as virulent as the <b>ascospores.</b> The disease cycle starts with airborne <b>ascospores</b> which are released from the pseudothecia in the spring. The <b>ascospores</b> enter through the stomata to infect the plant. Soon after the infection, gray lesions and black pycnidia form on the leaves.|$|R
50|$|A {{group of}} {{researchers}} studied another way bet-hedging {{is used by}} looking at the ascomycete fungus Neurospora crassa.

5000|$|After {{overwintering}} in leaf debris, ascostroma begin producing ascospores. <b>Ascospore</b> {{formation is}} accelerated by sequential wetting and drying {{of the leaf}} litter.

The ascospores are ejected from the fruiting bodies of the fungus during rainfall or irrigation and then dispersed by wind and water. Upon landing on susceptible tissue, the ascospores germinate and form appresoria. (Different tissues are susceptible to infection at different times. Leaves are susceptible up to 10 months of age.
