This model was validated experimentally in 1908 by French physicist Jean Perrin, thus providing additional validation for particle theory (and by extension atomic theory).|$|E

Killer whale cannibalism has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but {{this is likely to}} be the result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers. One killer whale was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident killer whales have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals for no <b>apparent</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 629, the Islamic Prophet Muhammad had {{recently}} succeeded in unifying all the tribes of the Arabian Peninsula. Those tribes {{had previously been}} too divided to pose a serious military challenge to the Byzantines or the Persians. Now unified and animated by their new conversion to Islam, they comprised {{one of the most}} powerful states in the region. The first conflict between the Byzantines and Muslims was the Battle of Mu'tah in September 629. A small Muslim skirmishing force attacked the province of Arabia in response to their ambassador's murder at the hands of the Ghassanid Roman governor, but were repulsed. Because the engagement was a Byzantine victory, there was no <b>apparent</b> <b>reason</b> to make changes to the military configuration of the region. Also, the Byzantines had little preceding battlefield experience with the Arabs, and even less with zealous soldiers united by a prophet. Even the Strategicon of Maurice, a manual of war praised for the variety of enemies it covers, does not mention warfare against Arabs at any length.|$|E
5|$|Kutzer {{points out}} Timmy {{and his wife}} wear clothes, but the other {{squirrels}} and the bear do not. There is no <b>apparent</b> <b>reason</b> for this differentiation. She admits {{that this may be}} Potter's attempt to separate her anthropomorphized animals from her natural ones, but she believes the attempt fails on both narrative and artistic grounds. Logically, she argues, all the squirrels should wear (or not wear) clothes because they all live and behave in a natural manner: Timmy and Goody inhabit a nest in a tree (not a comfortable little house somewhere), and all the squirrels gather nuts for the coming winter. Except for Timmy having a wife, there is no clear distinction between natural and personified squirrel nature. In another stumbling block to logic, Timmy's red jacket appears then disappears then reappears in the illustrations with no basis either in the plot or Timmy's character, but apparently in Potter's personal need for a splash of colour here and there. In this case, Potter has allowed an external force to shape the tale rather than letting the tale find its own shape.|$|E
5|$|Thrasher and Blastus are {{two teenage}} robots {{who live on}} the planet of Insanus. Their planet is {{inhabited}} by murderous robots who seek to kill one another for no <b>apparent</b> <b>reason.</b> Slightly less horrific than their peers, the duo seek to make it through high school, and navigate their lives with mixed results. Thrasher (Patton Oswalt), a tall and lanky robot, wishes to gain the affections of an attractive female robot named Maimy (Jessie Cantrell). Meanwhile, Blastus (John Gemberling), a small and rotund robot, just wants to be popular. As with Blastus, unlike most robots on Insanus, he is mostly sensitive and non-criminal, much to the disapproval of his mother. In his quest to be cool, however, he is incredibly impulsive and overconfident in his abilities. Thrasher, though calm and reserved, often falls prey to Blastus' badly-thought out plans.|$|E

5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no <b>apparent</b> <b>reason.</b> It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E

The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no <b>apparent</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Andy grows {{determined}} {{to escape from}} Shawshank, and informs Red {{that he is going}} to Zihuatanejo in Mexico, telling him that if he should ever get out of prison, he should go to a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, and there will be a volcanic rock, and a gift for him under it. During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In a fury, Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of David Cassidy on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing a hole through Cassidy's rectum. Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of Friends, allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a parole board and complains that the concept of rehabilitation is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; for no <b>apparent</b> <b>reason,</b> Red is put on parole anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in Zihuatanejo, eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red never does.|$|E

It was pointed out that ecological degradation of Eucalyptus plantation and strong invasiveness of A. adenophora are two <b>apparent</b> <b>reasons</b> for formation of Eucalyptus trees and A. adenophora complex system. Basic view of the authors on causes of the new phenomenon was put forward that resistance unbalance between chemical defensive potential of Eucalyptus trees and chemical invasive potential of A. adenophora might be the fundamental reason for formation of Eucalyptus trees and A. adenophora complex system, based on the two <b>apparent</b> <b>reasons</b> respectively connected with allelopathic effects of Eucalyptus trees and A. adenophora as dominant species of the complex system. Some proofs from studies on chemical components and biological activities of Eucalyptus species and A. adenophora have proved the basic view of the authors. It was discussed that formation of the complex system would influence some environmental elements such as soil environment, hydrology environment, and biology environment. It was proposed that three key scientific issues, namely chemical mechanism of formation of the complex system, ecological effects of formation of the complex system, and succession trends and impact factors of the complex system should be mainly studied as special researches to probe ecological relationship of exotic species because of absence study on the complex system and objective requirements of production practice in future. It was emphasized that the proposed researches might be of guidance significance to scientific management and sustainable operation of Eucalyptus plantation under the condition of biological invasion.
