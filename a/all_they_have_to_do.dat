In 2010 Harris stated, [...] "I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden's early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is listen to Wishbone Ash's Argus album. Thin Lizzy too, but not as much. And then {{we wanted to have}} a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull. So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it." [...] In 2004, Harris explained that the band's [...] "heaviness" [...] was inspired by [...] "Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in." [...] On top of this, Harris developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as [...] "more like a rhythm guitar," [...] cited as responsible for the band's galloping style, heard in such songs as [...] "The Trooper" [...] and [...] "Run to the Hills." ...|$|E
2500|$|Generally men aged 50 years, and on some islands men aged 60 years, {{do most of}} {{the talking}} and {{decision}} making at meetings of the community councils (Falekaupule), which are organised according to the law and custom of each island. Although women have the vote in meetings of the Falekaupule on [...] 7 of the 9 islands, but most do no exercise their voting rights. Milikini Failautusi, young Tuvaluan activist, has argued that cultural issues in Tuvalu are preventing women from working in equal partnership with men. For example, women cannot be appointed as an aliki (chief). Ms Failautusi is quoted as saying [...] "hen it comes to cultures, women they don't [...] to say anything at all. They don't have a say. They only have to sit at the back and support the elders or their husbands or the leaders in their families [...] [...] [...] <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is just support them in terms of looking for money, looking for food, and looking after the babies and the families".|$|E

For such, who are careful (as they call it) to principle children well, (and few there be who have not a set of those principles for them, which they believe in,) instil into the unwary, and as yet unprejudiced, understanding, (for white paper receives any characters,) those doctrines they would have them retain and profess.

6000|$|... 211. Suppose, for instance, in our English army, {{on the eve}} of {{some great}} battle, one of the colonels were to give his order to his regiment: [...] "My men, tie your belts over your eyes, throw down your muskets, and follow me as {{steadily}} as you can, through this marsh, {{into the middle of the}} enemy's line," [...] (this being precisely the order issued by our Puseyite Church officers). It might be questioned, in the real battle, whether it would be better that a regiment should show an example of insubordination, or be cut to pieces. But happily in the Church there is no such difficulty; for the King is always with His army: not only with His army, but at the right hand of every soldier of it. Therefore, if any of their colonels give them a strange command, <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to ask the King; and never yet any Christian asked guidance of his King, in any difficulty whatsoever, without mental reservation or secret resolution, but he had it forthwith. We conclude then, finally, that the authority of the Clergy is, in matters of discipline, large (being executive, first, of the written laws of God, and secondly, of those determined and agreed upon by the body of the Church), in matters of doctrine, dependent on their recommending themselves to every man's conscience, both as messengers of God, and as themselves men of God, perfect, and instructed to good works.[150] ...|$|E
60|$|The fact is, {{we want a}} head here. Colonels Merewether and Phayre {{have gone}} five days’ march away, taking with them all the {{available}} transport. Brigadier-General Collings only arrived yesterday, and of course has not as yet been able to set things in order. I am happy to say that General Staveley arrived last night, and I believe that he will soon bring some order into this chaos. The fact is, that in our army we leave the most important branch of the service to shift for itself. Unless the Land Transport Train is able to perform its duty, nothing can possibly go right; but the Land Transport Corps has no authority and no power. It is nobody’s child. The commissariat owns it not, the quartermaster and adjutant-general know nothing whatever of it. It may shift for itself. All the lâches of all the departments are thrown upon its shoulders, and the captains {{who are doing the}} work may slave night and day; but unaided and unassisted they can do nothing. The land transport should be a mere subordinate branch of the commissariat; that department should be bound to supply food at any required point. Now, <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to join the other departments in drawing indents for conveyance upon the unhappy land transport, and then sitting down and thanking their gods that they have done everything which could be expected of them. General Staveley is an energetic officer, and will, I believe, lose no time in putting things straight. Even to-day things look more hopeful, for General Collings yesterday afternoon put the services of 200 Madras dhoolie-bearers at the disposition of the Transport Corps to supply the place of the mule- and camel-drivers who have deserted. I have therefore every hope that in another week I shall have a very different story to tell. In addition, however, to the mortality caused by the voyage, by hardships, and by bad food and insufficient water, there is a great mortality among the horses and mules from an epidemic disease which bears a strong resemblance to the cattle-plague. Ten or twelve of the mules die a day from it, and the 3d Native Cavalry lost ninety horses from it while they were here. The district is famous, or rather infamous, for this epidemic; and the tribes from inland, when they come down into the plain, always leave their horses on the plateau, and come down on foot. The Soumalis and other native tribes along this shore are a quarrelsome lot, and fights are constantly occurring among the native workmen, who inflict serious, and sometimes fatal, injuries upon each other with short, heavy clubs resembling Australian waddies. The washing, at least such washing as is done, is sent up to Koomaylo. Yesterday two dhoolies, or washermen, were bringing a quantity of clothes down to the camp, when they were set upon by some natives, who killed one and knocked the other about terribly, and then went off with the clothes.|$|E
