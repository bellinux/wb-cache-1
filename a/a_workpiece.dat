25|$|The {{shoulder}} plane, {{is characterized}} by a cutter that is flush with the edges of the plane, allowing trimming right up to the edge of <b>a</b> <b>workpiece.</b> It is commonly used to clean up dadoes (housings) and tenons for joinery.|$|E
25|$|Plastic {{deformation}} involves using heat or {{pressure to}} make <b>a</b> <b>workpiece</b> more conductive to mechanical force. Historically, this and casting were done by blacksmiths, though today {{the process has}} been industrialized. In bulk metal forming, the workpiece is generally heated up.|$|E
25|$|Hold down: The {{circular}} sawblade of a tablesaw {{will pick}} {{up a piece of}} wood if not held down. Hold downs can be a vertical version of featherboards, attached to a fence with magnets or clamps. Another type of hold down uses wheels on a spring-loaded mechanism to push down on <b>a</b> <b>workpiece</b> as it is guided past the blade.|$|E

25|$|Marking out (also {{known as}} layout) {{is the process}} of {{transferring}} a design or pattern to <b>a</b> <b>workpiece</b> and {{is the first step in}} the handcraft of metalworking. It is performed in many industries or hobbies, although in industry, the repetition eliminates the need to mark out every individual piece. In the metal trades area, marking out consists of transferring the engineer's plan to the workpiece in preparation for the next step, machining or manufacture.|$|E
25|$|Cutting is {{initiated}} by heating the edge or leading face (as in cutting shapes such as round rod) {{of the steel}} to the ignition temperature (approximately bright cherry red heat) using the pre-heat jets only, then using the separate cutting oxygen valve to release the oxygen from the central jet. The oxygen chemically combines with the iron in the ferrous material to oxidize the iron quickly into molten iron oxide, producing the cut. Initiating {{a cut in the}} middle of <b>a</b> <b>workpiece</b> is known as piercing.|$|E
25|$|Induction heating is a {{non-contact}} {{process which}} uses {{the principle of}} electromagnetic induction to produce heat in <b>a</b> <b>workpiece.</b> By placing a conductive material into a strong alternating magnetic field, electric current is made to flow in the material, thereby causing Joule heating. In magnetic materials, further heat is generated below the Curie point due to hysteresis losses. The generated current is predominantly in the surface layer, the depth of this layer being dictated by {{the frequency of the}} alternating field and the permeability of the material.|$|E
5000|$|A {{counterbore}} (symbol: ⌴) is a cylindrical flat-bottomed {{hole that}} enlarges another coaxial hole, or the tool {{used to create}} that feature.

25|$|In metal, the lip and {{spur drill}} bit is {{confined}} to drilling only the thinnest and softest sheet metals in a drill press. The bits have an extremely fast cutting tool geometry: no point angle and a large (considering the flat cutting edge) lip angle causes the edges {{to take a very}} aggressive cut with relatively little point pressure. This means these bits tend to bind in metal; given <b>a</b> <b>workpiece</b> of sufficient thinness, they have a tendency to punch through and leave the bit's cross-sectional geometry behind.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two basic}} types of rotary swaging machine, the {{standard}} (also known as a tagging machine), and the butt swaging machine. A butt swaging machine works by having sets of wedges that close the dies onto the workpiece by inserting them between the annular rollers and the dies, normally {{by the use of}} a foot pedal. A butt swaging machine can allow <b>a</b> <b>workpiece</b> to be inserted without the dies closing on it, for example a three-foot workpiece can be inserted 12inches and then the dies closed, drawn through until 12inches remain and the dies are then released, the finished workpiece would then, for example, be four feet long but still of its initial diameter for a foot at each end.|$|E
25|$|Center drill bits, {{occasionally}} {{known as}} Slocombe drill bits, {{are used in}} metalworking to provide a starting hole for a larger-sized drill bit or to make a conical indentation {{in the end of}} <b>a</b> <b>workpiece</b> in which to mount a lathe center. In either use, the name seems appropriate, as the bit is either establishing the center of a hole or making a conical hole for a lathe center. However, the true purpose of a center drill bit is the latter task, while the former task is best done with a spotting drill bit (as explained in detail below). Nevertheless, because of the frequent lumping together of both the terminology and the tool use, suppliers may call center drill bits combined-drill-and-countersinks {{in order to make it}} unambiguously clear what product is being ordered. They are numbered from 00 to 10 (smallest to largest).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In surface grinding, {{the shape}} error is {{occurred}} by the thermal deformation of <b>a</b> ground <b>workpiece.</b> To finish the workpiece with high accuracy, {{it is necessary}} to understand the temperature distribution of the workpiece during grinding process. However there is no study to analyze the temperature distribution of <b>a</b> large <b>workpiece</b> during surface grinding process. In this study, an advanced simulation analysis method of the temperature distribution for <b>a</b> large <b>workpiece</b> was developed. In the developed simulation analysis method, the temperature distribution was calculated from the power consumption of the wheel motor. The power consumption can be obtained easily without any specialized equipment. To evaluate the developed simulation analysis method, in-process measurement of the temperature distribution of <b>a</b> large <b>workpiece</b> was also carried out. <b>A</b> large <b>workpiece</b> ground in this study weights about 1. 3 tons. The temperature distribution was measured with thermistors mounted in many places of the ground workpiece. At the area close to the grinding surface, it was found that temperature rises immediately after the passage of grinding wheel with measuring the developed in-process measurement system. On the other hand, at the area far from the grinding point, temperature does not change quickly. The in-process measured temperature distribution agreed well with the simulated results...|$|R
50|$|Induction welding {{is a form}} of welding {{that uses}} {{electromagnetic}} induction to heat the workpiece. The welding apparatus contains an induction coil that is energised with a radio-frequency electric current. This generates a high-frequency electromagnetic field that acts on either an electrically conductive or <b>a</b> ferromagnetic <b>workpiece.</b> In <b>an</b> electrically conductive <b>workpiece,</b> the main heating effect is resistive heating, which is due to induced currents called eddy currents. In <b>a</b> ferromagnetic <b>workpiece,</b> the heating is caused mainly by hysteresis, as the electromagnetic field repeatedly distorts the magnetic domains of the ferromagnetic material. In practice, most materials undergo a combination of these two effects.|$|R

500|$|Straddle broaches use two slab broaches to cut {{parallel}} surfaces {{on opposite}} sides of <b>a</b> <b>workpiece</b> in one pass. This type of broaching holds closer tolerances than if the two cuts were done independently. It is named after the fact that the broaches [...] "straddle" [...] the workpiece on multiple sides.|$|E
500|$|The {{emphasis}} on manufacturing, especially that done under licence, {{became even more}} apparent following {{the imposition of a}} 20% duty on imported machine tools and reduced demand, both triggered by the Great Depression. There was much innovation and many of these advances were pioneering techniques that are now universal, although from a trading perspective things were dire for the companies. In particular, The Churchill Machine Tool Co successfully harnessed the utility of hydraulics in many aspects of its machinery and developed a cambering mechanism for grinding rollers used in, for example, the paper industry. In 1932 H H Asbridge's [...] "Hydrauto" [...] bearing was introduced: this aided precision positioning of <b>a</b> <b>workpiece</b> with almost no intervening film of lubrication.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe dynamic process {{behavior}} during milling {{often leads to}} vibrations or even chatter and, thereby, to surface location errors. In this paper, a multi-scale simulation system is presented, which can predict these errors efficiently by combining <b>a</b> dexel-based <b>workpiece</b> representation with <b>a</b> CSG-based process model and an oscillator-based system for the process dynamics.
