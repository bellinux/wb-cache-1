5|$|At King Edward's death, {{only the}} royal estates and the estates of Harold were larger and wealthier than those held by Stigand. Medieval writers {{condemned}} {{him for his}} greed and for his pluralism. Hugh the Chanter, a medieval chronicler, claimed that the confiscated wealth of Stigand helped keep King William on the throne. A recent study of his wealth <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> earned shows that while he did engage in some exploitative methods to gain some of his wealth, other lands were gained through inheritance or through royal favour. The same study shows little evidence that he despoiled his episcopal estates, although the record towards monastic houses is more suspect. There is no complaint in contemporary records about his private life, and the accusations that he committed simony and was illiterate only date from the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|The Gamezebo {{reviewer}} {{had special}} {{praise for the}} game's sound design <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> used to clue the player into puzzle solutions. TouchArcade commended how the game's sparse story unfolded by watching the assassination targets go about their time at the compound. The reviewer also noted that his suspension of disbelief was broken when characters would eventually return to partying after reacting to a gunshot, but suggested that the game's Easter eggs redeemed its psychopathic qualities. Pocket Gamer wrote that the game did not reach the heights of the series' situational humor in hiding bodies stealthily. Other criticism included Gamezebo, which blamed the game's core multiplier ability for breaking {{the balance of the}} game. TouchArcade thought that the game played better on the tablet iPad than on the smaller iPhone, and praised the feature that synced game progress, since Apple's iCloud service was known for its struggle to successfully implement the same feature. Despite Square Enix Montreal being best known for its Go series, Hitman: Sniper was the studio's biggest revenue generator. As its most lucrative title, the game helped to fund the development of the Go series.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{beginnings}} of the Colombian tiple and its use in Colombia. The first accounts exist in an article published in 1849 by Jose Caicedo Rojas; in it he narrates a story that takes place in Chitaraque, near San Gil, Santander; about some soldiers that deserted the military after they became melancholic during a night of party.

25|$|The {{image on}} the shroud is much clearer in {{black-and-white}} negative than in its natural sepia color, and this negative image was first observed in 1898 on the reverse photographic plate of amateur photographer Secondo Pia, who was allowed to photograph it while it was being exhibited.

Despite numerous investigations and tests, the status of the Shroud of Turin remains murky, {{and the nature of the}} image <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> fixed on the cloth remain puzzling.
