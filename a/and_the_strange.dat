Although he attempted a series of increasingly desperate manoeuveres {{in his efforts to}} escape, Hallowell's ship was in poor repair and under-crewed and after a short exchange of fire, was forced to surrender. Without any warning, Warren was not able to intercept Ganteaume's return, and the French squadron was able to reach Toulon unharmed on 22 July.|$|E

25|$|A man (McKinney) named Darill (pronounced da-RILL), {{who never}} quite understands {{what is going}} on, but always tries to affect an air of sophistication. Darill's strange mix of sunny good will, idiocy and pretense annoys {{everyone}} he meets, although he is rarely aware of it. Famous Darill sketches involve him hosting a painting show on television, and joining the Big Brother program and mentoring an unreceptive boy. The background for Darill's strange behavior is explained somewhat in one sketch, in which we see a flashback of Darill {{as a child in}} Belgium, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>strange</b> rapport he enjoys with his mother (whom he still lives with, much to the confusion of the date he has brought back to his apartment). One sketch also reveals that the only thing he ever daydreams about is a tiny oom-pah band playing on a windowsill, and is astonished when he discovers others don't have that limitation. After the end of The Kids in the Hall television show, Mark McKinney became a Saturday Night Live cast member, and brought Darill onto that show.|$|E
25|$|Although the Cholas did not {{established}} a direct rule over Srivijayan court, Chola nobles were accepted graciously in Srivijayan court. In 1067 CE, a Chola prince named Divakara or Devakala was sent as a Srivijayan {{ambassador to the}} Imperial Court of China. The prince who was the nephew of Rajendra Chola later was enthroned in 1070 CE as Kulothunga Chola I. The humiliating defeat of Srivijayan Mandala against foreign invasion, has exposed the weaknesses and vurnerability of Srivijayan allegiance and alliance model. Among the disillusioned regional polities that {{jump out of the}} wagon, Kedah was the first that rebelled against the central Srivijayan authority. As the response, Srivijaya asked the Chola's help to punish and suppress Kedah rebellion. In 1068 CE, Virarajendra Chola launched a naval raid to help Srivijaya reclaim Kedah. Virarajendra reinstated the Kedah king {{at the request of the}} Srivijayan Maharaja and Kedah accepted the Srivijayan sovereignty. After this the Chola ruler Kulothunga Chola I became the ruler of Srivijaya which is mentioned in the Song chronicles. This peculiar event <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>strange</b> dynamic between Srivijaya and its former nemesis, the Cholas, has confused the Chinese court, that in their report mistakenly thought that the Chola was the vassal of Srivijaya.|$|E

Nick Pinkerton of Sci Fi Weekly called Fox and Seyfried's lesbian kissing scene [...] "the best close-up girl-girl liplock" [...] since Cruel Intentions, and A. O.

500|$|Alfred Bem postulates in Dramatizatsiia breda that The Landlady {{incorporates}} autobiographical elements. Influenced by Freud's psychoanalysis, {{he argued}} that Ordynov's familial relationship with Katerina and Murin was similar to Dostoyevsky's own, and found reflections of the writer's affair with Avdotya Panayeva, whom he met within her husband's political circle. Bem states that tiring quarrels between circle members Nikolay Nekrasov and Ivan Turgenev worsened Dostoyevsky's health, although he had stress problems prior to working on The Landlady. Elements of Gothic literature were also detected in the story's dark atmosphere, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>strange</b> character {{of the relationship between}} Katerina and Ordynov.

Some 27 sorties were made visually and 10 by radar, striking 17 primary targets, 15 secondary targets, and five targets of opportunity.

500|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20th century Deckham's rural aspect had changed. Whilst there {{remained}} large areas of grass and woodland between Deckham and Gateshead, there was a period of extensive building; several dozen dwellings were erected by 1895 in the Mount Pleasant area as Gateshead expanded southwards. A public house was built at the junction of Taylor Terrace and Split Crow Road. Two years later, a tract of Tyneside flats was built {{on the west side of}} the Old Durham Road and many streets in the area, such as Chandos Street, Shipcote Terrace, Raby Street and Northborne Street, are evidenced, along with an unnamed school. By 1919, some rural scenes could still be enjoyed but the fields were [...] "rapidly encroached upon" [...] in the 1920s and 1930s and replaced with more terraced housing at Caris Street, Fullerton Place and Methuen Street and large tracts of council houses. By this time, Deckham Hall was in a state of disrepair and was notable to residents for its resemblance to a haunted house [...] "because of its air of gloom <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>strange</b> echoes to be heard on windy nights". The hall was demolished in 1930 and more council houses were erected on the site.|$|E
500|$|Ryan Lambie of Den of Geek said of {{the first}} episode; [...] "In terms of writing and acting, Mad Dogs is good, but not perfect, and much of its knock-about banter is uncannily like any Brit gangster flick you've ever seen," [...] like [...] "Sexy Beast: the series." [...] However Lambie noted [...] "when events push its premise from naff lads' drama into exotic thriller, Mad Dogs gets {{infinitely}} better, and if nothing else, it keeps you guessing. As the series progressed, Lambie noted that Mad Dogs was [...] "developing into a nifty TV thriller with an engaging sense of the absurd. Writer, Cris Cole, enjoys picking holes in his characters' machismo as the tension mounts, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>strange</b> billboard posters dotted all over the sun-scorched island, which say [...] "Yenda a ninguna parte," [...] ("Going nowhere") are perhaps a foreshadowing of their imminent fate." [...] Lambie was disappointed at the ending, calling it [...] "unexpectedly flat," [...] adding [...] "the major plot twist that the previous three-or-so hours appeared to allude to never arrives, [...] I couldn't help but feel that, as the closing credits rolled on the whole saga, the tension and intrigue that had gradually built up in previous weeks {{had been allowed to}} slip away.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics.

David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound also agreed that [...] "the [...] singles are extraordinarily infectious, as is [...] "Inside Out", which slows the tempo, simultaneously sending Spears back to basics vocally, and into 2011 sonically." [...] On her review of Femme Fatale, Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club commented that [...] "songs like the dark, slinky [...] "Inside Out", the hyper-Euro chant-along [...] "Till The World Ends", <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>strange,</b> flute-assisted digression [...] "Criminal" [...] add texture to the wall-to-wall synth waves and booty bass." [...] The Guardians Alexis Petridis commented that the song [...] "lurches along on 's patent half-speed rhythm." [...] While Keith Caufield of Billboard considered [...] "Inside Out" [...] "easily a natural pick for 'Femme's' third single", Hannah Rishel of The Daily Collegian said that [...] "in general the song failed to hold my attention. If I heard it on the radio, I probably would change the station." [...] Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times also gave the song a negative review, considering it a [...] "weak mid-tempo fare", along with [...] "Criminal". Following the release of Femme Fatale, [...] "Inside Out" [...] reached number fifty-nine on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart, after selling 7,222 digital units of the song alone.|$|E
