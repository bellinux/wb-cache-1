The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the observable universe. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer.

Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler {{will not be able to}} interact with all of space.

In contrast, British trench practice had been to give a military-straight neat edge to the parapet top, making any movement or protrusion immediately obvious.|$|E
5|$|Some redshifts are {{an example}} of the Doppler effect, {{familiar}} in the change of apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles. A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from <b>an</b> <b>observer.</b> A special instance of this is the cosmological redshift, which is due to the expansion of the universe, and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million light years away) show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase in their distance from Earth. Finally, gravitational redshift is a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward <b>an</b> <b>observer</b> or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.|$|E
