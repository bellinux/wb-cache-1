5|$|For many {{diseases}} of the heart, including <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> and valvular disease, and after a heart operation, anticoagulation {{in the form of}} aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel or novel oral anticoagulants is often given simultaneously, because of an increased risk of stroke or, {{in the context of a}} clotted heart vessel, rethrombosis.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{instrumented}} bed for unobtrusive, non-contact monitoring of cardiac and respiratory activity. The system presented here {{is based on}} the principle of ballistocardiography (BCG), and measures cardiopulmonary vibrations of the body by means of an electromechanical foil (EMFi) attached to the mattress. Using our system, a clinical study with 13 participants was conducted to assess the BCG’s ability to distinguish <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillations</b> from normal sinus rhythms. By computing a time-frequency representation of the recorded signals based on parametric autoregressive estimators, we can show clear qualitative differences between normal and arrhythmic BCG episodes. The same distinctive features could also be observed when applying our method to a simultaneously recorded reference ECG. Our results suggest that ECG and BCG both contain the same basic information with respect to the presence of <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillations,</b> and that a bed-mounted BCG sensor can indeed be used to detect <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillations...</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{is likely}} that {{vanoxerine}} acts to prevent reentrant circuits. Vanoxerine terminates atrial flutters and <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillations</b> (both cardiac abnormal heart rhythms) by blocking the recirculating electrical signal, and preventing the reformation of the reentrant circuit. Vanoxerine has also shown a tendency to reduce the recurrence of cardiac arrhythmias, as it was exceedingly difficult to reproduce an <b>atrial</b> flutter or <b>fibrillation</b> in a subject that had been taking vanoxerine.|$|R

5|$|In some countries, other {{coumarins}} {{are used}} instead of warfarin, such as acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon. These have a shorter (acenocoumarol) or longer (phenprocoumon) half-life, and are not completely interchangeable with warfarin. Several types of anticoagulant drugs offering the efficacy of warfarin without a need for monitoring, such as dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban, have been approved {{in a number of}} countries for classical warfarin uses like the more common types of <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation,</b> and others in the same drug classes are under development. There is a reversal agent available for dabigatran (idarucizumab) but not for apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{suffered}} a severe stroke on April 18, 1994, while preparing to eat dinner in his Park Ridge, New Jersey home. A blood clot {{resulting from the}} <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> he had suffered for many years had formed in his upper heart, broken off, and traveled to his brain. He was taken to New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg.

5|$|On July 12, 2008, Cheney {{underwent}} a cardiological exam; doctors reported that his heartbeat was normal for a 67-year-old {{man with a}} history of heart problems. As part of his annual checkup, he was administered an electrocardiogram and radiological imaging of the stents placed in the arteries behind his knees in 2005. Doctors said that Cheney had not experienced any recurrence of <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> and that his special pacemaker had neither detected nor treated any arrhythmia. On October 15, 2008, Cheney returned to the hospital briefly to treat a minor irregularity.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} chaotic analysis of heart rate variability. The box-counting dimensions and the largest Lyapunov exponents were determined from normal individuals and patients with cardiac diseases. The following was revealed, i) the box-counting dimensions, the largest Lyapunov exponents and the positive rates of the largest Lyapunov exponents decreased with the aging of individuals, ii) in cases of patients with diabetes mellitus, deep coma or acute myocardial infarction, the box-counting dimensions were {{lower than that of}} normal individuals and the largest Lyapunov exponents were almost all negative, iii) the largest Lyapunov exponents of patients with <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillations</b> or frequent premature beats were all positive and higher than that of normal individuals, and iv) the box-counting dimensions of the patients with <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillations</b> were higher and those of patients with frequent premature beats were lower than that of normal Individuals. From these results, it was suggested that patients with cardiac diseases may have higher or lower box-counting dimensions than that of normal individuals, so-called "chaotic characteristics" of heart rate variability may decrease with aging, and the chaotic characteristics may increase or decrease when the individual has cardiac disease. The function of the autonomic nervous system and/or the cardiovascular system can be shown visually in a 3 -dimensional phase space. Thus, this method can be a new tool for clinical diagnosis...|$|R

Due {{to the introduction of}} the current guidelines for the prevention of systemic thromboembolic events in patients with <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillations</b> and to {{an increase in the number}} of older patients, there has been a rise in the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) associated with the use of oral anticoagulants. The paper discusses medical treatment in patients with HS during therapy with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin) and novel oral anticoagulants (dabigatran. rivaroxaban, apixaban), as well as an anticoagulant resumption policy after prior ICH in patients at high risk for thromboembolic events. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{autonomous}} {{nervous system}} {{plays a key}} role in modulation of cardiac electrophysiology. Despite a great body of data on the presence of anatomic and functional relations between the nervous system and the heart, there remain a number of questions unanswered. Denervation of renal arteries or renal denervation (RDN) has become a crucial interventional technique when treating resistant arterial hypertension (AHT). Since the latter is the most prevailing cardiovascular disease complicating the course of heart rhythm disorders, <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillations</b> in particular, it would be a good idea to study a potential value of RDN as antiarrhythmic therapy...|$|R
5|$|Hypokalemia (low blood {{potassium}} levels) commonly {{occurs during}} attacks; levels below 3.0mmol/l are typically encountered. Magnesium and phosphate levels are often {{found to be}} decreased. Creatine kinase levels are elevated in two thirds of cases, usually due to a degree of muscle injury; severe elevations suggestive of rhabdomyolysis (muscle tissue destruction) are rare. Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) may show tachycardia (a fast heart rate) due to the thyroid disease, abnormalities due to cardiac arrhythmia (<b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation,</b> ventricular tachycardia), and conduction changes associated with hypokalemia (U waves, QRS widening, QT prolongation, and T wave flattening). Electromyography shows changes similar to those encountered in myopathies (muscle diseases), with a reduced amplitude of the compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs); they resolve when treatment has commenced.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, 2006, Dick Cheney shot Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old Texas attorney, while {{participating}} in a quail hunt at Armstrong ranch in Kenedy County, Texas. Secret Service agents and medical aides, who were traveling with Cheney, came to Whittington's assistance and treated his birdshot wounds to his right cheek, neck, and chest. An ambulance standing by for the Vice President took Whittington to nearby Kingsville before he was flown by helicopter to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital. On February 14, 2006, Whittington had a non-fatal heart attack and <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> due {{to at least one}} lead-shot pellet lodged in or near his heart. Because of the small size of the birdshot pellets, doctors decided to leave up to 30 pieces of the pellets lodged in his body rather than try to remove them.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin is {{best suited}} for anticoagulation (clot {{formation}} inhibition) in areas of slowly running blood (such as in veins and the pooled blood behind artificial and natural valves) and in blood pooled in dysfunctional cardiac atria. Thus, common clinical indications for warfarin use are <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation,</b> the presence of artificial heart valves, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism (where the embolized clots first form in veins). Warfarin is also used in antiphospholipid syndrome. It has been used occasionally after heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), but is far less effective at preventing new thromboses in coronary arteries. Prevention of clotting in arteries is usually undertaken with antiplatelet drugs, which act by a different mechanism from warfarin (which normally {{has no effect on}} platelet function).|$|E

The results of the study suggest that the patients with AF have frequently anxiety and hypochondriacal disorders, which agrees with the data available in the literature.

40|$|If {{patients}} {{being treated}} with anticoagulants need to undergo an operation then physicians {{need to consider}} whether to suspend {{the use of this}} medication or to allow its use to be continued. Suspending the use of anticoagulants increases the risk of thrombosis, whereas continued use may cause bleeding complications. No evidence-based scientific research has been carried out regarding best practice for the perioperative use of anticoagulants. Antithrombotic drugs are vitamin K antagonists and platelet aggregation inhibitors. For daily practice, appropriate bridging strategies can be used for perioperative anticoagulant policy for various risk groups, such as patients with venous thromboembolism, <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillations,</b> mechanical heart valves and coronary heart diseases (including coronary stents) and patients who have experienced a cerebrovascular accident.

5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (<b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation),</b> immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E
5|$|LeHand {{was born}} in Potsdam, New York, to DanielJ. and MaryJ. (née Graffin) LeHand, who were the {{children}} of Irish immigrants. The parents began their family at age 16 with a son, also called Daniel, followed by Bernard, Anna and finally Marguerite, {{when they were in}} their 40s. When she was a young child, the family relocated to Somerville, a working class suburb of Boston, where LeHand was struck by rheumatic fever at age fifteen. It permanently damaged her heart, causing episodes of <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation</b> and leading to her premature death. Eleanor Roosevelt later stated that the disease had left her delicate and barred from strenuous exercise. She graduated from Somerville High School in 1917, where she took secretarial courses in preparation for a career. Although she never attended college, in 1937 Rosary College (now called Dominican University) recognized her professional achievements with an honorary Doctor of Laws, presented at the White House.|$|E
5|$|Most strokes {{result from}} loss of blood supply, {{typically}} {{because of an}} embolus, rupture of a fatty plaque or narrowing of small arteries. Strokes can also result from bleeding within the brain. Transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) are strokes in which symptoms resolve within 24 hours. Investigation into the stroke will involve a medical examination (including a neurological examination) and the taking of a medical history, focusing on {{the duration of the}} symptoms and risk factors (including high blood pressure, <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation,</b> and smoking). Further investigation is needed in younger patients. An ECG and biotelemetry may be conducted to identify atrial fibrillation; an ultrasound can investigate narrowing of the carotid arteries; an echocardiogram can be used to look for clots within the heart, diseases of the heart valves or the presence of a patent foramen ovale. Blood tests are routinely done as part of the workup including diabetes tests and a lipid profile.|$|E
40|$|Stroke is {{a leading}} cause of {{disability}} not only due to its impact on motor or sensory functions, but also to post-stroke cognitive impairments (CI). Within the first year after stroke, the rate of CI may be as high as 80 - 90 % and 7 - 23 % of patients develop dementia. The most important risk factors for CI are strokes, their extent, site, and number. Old age, low education level, severe previous pathological changes in the brain parenchyma, diabetes mellitus, <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillations,</b> and recurrent strokes in particular, are associated with an increased risk of CI.  Examining cognitive functions, monitoring the evolution of cognitive deficit, and post-stroke rehabilitation are indicated in patients who have had stroke. The main treatments in patients with CI are secondary stroke prevention, including lifestyle modification and symptomatic therapy. Sermion is one of the promising agents for the prevention and treatment of CI in these patients. </p...|$|R
40|$|A 72 -year-old {{woman with}} sick sinus {{syndrome}} (SSS), who had frequent paroxysmal <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillations</b> (PAfs) and normal cardiac function, {{was admitted to}} our hospital due to syncope. PAfs frequently occurred {{during the first week}} after DDD pacemaker implantation (PMI), with closed loop stimulation (CLS) rate-adaptive mode off, but were completely suppressed during the second week, with CLS on, and had been well-controlled over three years thereafter. However, PAfs occasionally occurred under intense sympathetic activity during 6 months after PMI as well, and were effectively terminated by disopyramide which had anticholinergic effect. Thus, the development and maintenance of PAf were thought to be associated with destabilized cardiac autonomic activities, that is, sympathetic and parasympathetic dominance, respectively. Additionally, heart rate variability analyses after implementation of CLS revealed the restoration of sympathetic and parasympathetic components. Accordingly, CLS mode was considered to {{play a critical role in}} preventing PAf by reflecting autonomic activity in heart rhythm in this SSS patient...|$|R

5|$|The main {{manifestations of}} carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning develop in the organ systems most dependent on oxygen use, {{the central nervous system}} and the heart. The initial symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, nausea, malaise, and fatigue. These symptoms are often mistaken for a virus such as influenza or other illnesses such as food poisoning or gastroenteritis. Headache is the most common symptom of acute carbon monoxide poisoning; it is often described as dull, frontal, and continuous. Increasing exposure produces cardiac abnormalities including fast heart rate, low blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmia; central nervous system symptoms include delirium, hallucinations, dizziness, unsteady gait, confusion, seizures, central nervous system depression, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest, and death. Less common symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include myocardial ischemia, <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation,</b> pneumonia, pulmonary edema, high blood sugar, lactic acidosis, muscle necrosis, acute kidney failure, skin lesions, and visual and auditory problems.|$|E
5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink a day for women or two drinks for men {{increases}} the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, <b>atrial</b> <b>fibrillation,</b> and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E
