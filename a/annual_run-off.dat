50|$|Water {{flow rates}} in the Pembina River {{watershed}} are highly variable. Data from hydrometric stations are used to monitor river flow rates and lake levels, for flood forecasting, and water management investigations. Water levels typically peak during spring run-off and rapidly declines generally in a few days. Groundwater contribution to stream flow normally ensures the river runs throughout the year. The months of March, April and May account for 68 percent of the run-off in a given year. <b>Annual</b> spring <b>run-off</b> rates are highly variable. In Neche, ND the lowest annual volume recorded was 356-m (2870 acre-ft) in 1939. The highest recorded volume was 94,400 hectare-m (765,000 acre-ft) in 1997.|$|R

Fluxes are lowest in 2001 and increase to 2004. Whilst 2004 freshwater and volume fluxes match previous maxima (1998), the 2004 heat flux {{is the highest}} recorded, partly due to ~ 0. 5 ºC warmer temperatures since 2002. The Alaskan Coastal Current, contributing about 1 / 3 rd of the heat and of the freshwater fluxes, also shows strong warming and freshening between 2002 and 2004. The increased Bering Strait heat input between 2001 and 2004 (> 2 x 1020 J) could melt 640, 000 km 2 of 1 m thick ice; the 3 -year freshwater increase (~ 800 km 3) is about of <b>annual</b> Arctic river <b>run-off.</b> Weaker southward winds likely explain the increased volume flux (~ 0. 7 to ~ 1 Sv), causing ~ 80 % of the freshwater and ~ 50 % of the heat flux increases...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Those {{locations}} and features providing refugia for species during unfavourable climatic phases {{may be important}} to identify and conserve to help protect biodiversity in the near future. During the Pleistocene, climates oscillated between glacial and interglacial periods. In the Northern Hemisphere, the impact from glacial ice sheets caused species to disperse to warmer southern refugia, but less is known about changes to species' distributions during these periods in the Southern Hemisphere. Location: In Australia, the climate alternated between highly arid and wetter periods during the Pleistocene. It has been proposed that arid refugia {{may be associated with}} the inland ranges (areas of higher relief), the mesic east, or areas that maintained favourable species-specific ecological conditions. We tested these hypotheses with a phylogeographical analysis of a widely distributed tree-dwelling gecko, Gehyra variegata (2 n = 40 a chromosomal race) throughout the central and eastern regions of arid Australia. Methods: We generated a mtDNA sequence and microsatellite dataset by sampling 740 G. variegata 40 a throughout its known distribution. We also use species distribution modelling to predict the species' likely past, present and future distribution. Results: The majority of G. variegata 40 a lineages diverged during the Pleistocene, and those located in regions of arid Australia where mean <b>annual</b> water <b>run-off</b> is highest, displayed higher levels of genetic diversity in comparison locations with lower run-off. We also show that genetic diversity increased with proximity to water sources. Main conclusions: It is likely that G. variegata 40 a contracted to refugia associated with stable water sources during Pleistocene arid phases. However, modelling suggests that unfavourable climate conditions will be present in this region by 2070. Therefore, Pleistocene refugia for G. variegata 40 a are unlikely to be refugia in the future. More generally, our results suggest that water run-off could be a useful predictor to identify favourable conditions for some arid species. 12 page(s...|$|R
30|$|The {{study area}} is very dry with sparse vegetation, {{and most of}} the {{rainfall}} either infiltrates or is lost due to evaporation, which is common in arid and semiarid regions (Xu and Singh 2004). A very small portion of the rainfall over the catchment is converted to surface run-off and finally reaches the water bodies. In this study, surface run-off was estimated from the SCS curve number procedure (SCS 1972). Senay and Verdin (2004) generated gridded <b>annual</b> <b>run-off</b> estimates for Africa at 10 -km spatial resolution. The <b>annual</b> <b>run-off</b> coefficients were summarized for the study area and were found to vary from 0.02 to 0.1 with an average coefficient of 0.05. We used the average run-off coefficient in combination with TRMM rainfall to estimate catchment run-off contribution. The use of a uniform run-off coefficient makes the modelling approach simple and parsimonious, but less accurate. However, considering the homogeneous and dry landscape and since the objective {{of this study was to}} model the patterns and variations in the waterhole water levels and not the absolute water levels, the use of a constant run-off coefficient produces run-off estimates with a reliable precision.|$|E
40|$|Although {{the global}} {{agricultural}} system {{will need to}} provide more food for a growing and wealthier population in decades to come, increasing demands for water and potential impacts of climate change pose threats to food systems. We review the primary threats to agricultural water availability, and model the potential effects of increases in municipal and industrial (M&I) water demands, environmental flow requirements (EFRs) and changing water supplies given climate change. Our models show that, together, these factors cause an 18 per cent reduction in the availability of worldwide water for agriculture by 2050. Meeting EFRs, which can necessitate more than 50 per cent of the mean <b>annual</b> <b>run-off</b> in a basin depending on its hydrograph, presents the single biggest threat to agricultural water availability. Next are increases in M&I demands, which are projected to increase upwards of 200 per cent by 2050 in developing countries with rapidly increasing populations and incomes. Climate change will affect the spatial and temporal distribution of run-off, and thus affect availability from the supply side.

40|$|This survey {{aimed at}} {{correlating}} {{the abundance of}} Astacopsis gouldi, the world's largest freshwater crayfish, with two different plantation types in Northern Tasmania. After a pilot study revealed inherent difficulties in relying on conventional methods to select suitable sampling sites, selection criteria were refined and ultimately improved {{through the use of}} species distribution modelling (MaxEnt). Accumulated mean <b>annual</b> <b>run-off</b> and mean annual rainfall stood out as important in the model and helped to reduce the proportion of intermittent streams in the data set. Analyses conclude that there is no observable plantation effect that correlates with crayfish abundance; however, this should be taken with caution because the sample size was too small to detect a potential effect on crayfish abundance. As a result, approximately 15 - 18 sites are recommended to be used per tested group. A classification tree further suggests that the presence of undercut banks, log jams and submerged logs might constitute important mesa-habitat features that should require further analysis in the future. The study is thus more recommendative in nature and should assist future researchers to develop effective sampling strategies to address the difficulties inherent in assessing crayfish abundance in plantation streams...|$|E

The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the conflicts and trade-off among environmental, economic and social interests by using three continuous multi-criteria approaches and a set of different weights. Different land uses, crops, pastures, forestry and soil and water conservation practices at the basin scale in the marginal Pampas were assessed. The basin (423 Â km 2) was discretised into 176 sub-basins to focus the management strategy on 5 th and 6 th order streams. Minimum basic information was obtained using intensive field observations and satellite images. The basin hydrology, soil erosion, sediment delivery and vegetated filter strip models and GIS were used to quantify the technical coefficients. Thirteen decision factors and six criteria (peak <b>run-off,</b> <b>annual</b> erosion, sediment, investment, gross margin and employment) were used in the optimisation trials. Weighted goal programming, lexicographic goal programming, compromise programming and a sensitivity analysis of weights were performed. The results showed a high impact of soil and water management practices on the environmental factors and a strong conflict between environmental and economic interests. The three multi-criteria approaches also showed that it is possible to obtain a good level of goal achievement with different plans. These plans should include: soil conservation practices; crop rotation (of a 2 : 1 soybean-to-corn ratio); gully and channel erosion control; regulation ponds; and pasture and agro-forestry areas. This goal achievement is mainly limited by public and private investment. Sensitivity analysis of the decision-maker weights shows differences among the values achieved by the criteria and their trade-off. Thus, the weight value of each criterium should be supported by the negotiation-consensus process.

40|$|Study on Hillslope Soil Hydrology with Various Bahia Grass Treatment Abstract Soil {{moisture}} lysimeter is {{an equipment}} with fixed volume usually utilized to study hillslope hydrology and soil erosion. Three lysimeter were located separatedly at the plots of covered, mulched and bare hillslope for 20 years {{in order to}} study the influence of different treatment on the physical property and hydrogy of soil. General infiltration was measured by static cylinder infiltratiometer. Rainfall infiltration changed with rainfall intensity, slope degree and rough degree was in a dynamic state. Covered and mulched treatments could keep much more rainwater and increased infiltration of soil. After long-term treatments, accumulating infiltration decreased in all three cylinder infiltratiometer. Simulating tests with Kostiakov, Horton, Philip and Swartzendruber infiltration model were also studied. Swartzendruber model was the best one for calculating static infiltration in this experiment. There were much more porosity in the slope covered with long-root Bahia grasses. Much more rainwater was absorbed by the soil than permeated down to the underground to complement the underground water resource. Series of regression equations about <b>annual</b> rainfall to <b>run-off,</b> infiltration and evapotranspiration were established by useing of the data of hydrology studies from 1976 to 1995. It was shown that this study model was useful for the prediction of annual hydrology and the management of water resource on the hillslope. 坡地百喜草處理之土壤水文研究 摘 要 土壤水分測滲計因具有固定之控制體積，在坡地水文及沖蝕之研究上，常用來作為研究之設施。本研究即在一獨立小山丘之山頂，以土壤水分測滲計，長期觀測研究覆蓋、敷蓋及裸露三種不同水土保持處理，對坡地土壤物理性質及水文之影響。結果發現，一般滲透量之觀測以靜態圓筒式滲透筒為最常用的方法，是在平面、定水頭及長時間下進行，但於現地降雨時，滲透是以動態方式進行，水流隨降雨強度、坡度及糙度而滯留坡面之時間長短不一，植生覆蓋或敷蓋處理，除能截留部分之雨水外，因增加坡面的糙度，降低水流速度，延長水流在坡面之時間，進而提高了累積滲透量。但經長期連續處理，以圓筒式入滲計觀測其累積滲透量均有逐漸降低之趨勢，其原因可能與土壤中之孔隙率變化及有機質、土粒等堵塞孔道有關，有待再研究之必要。本研究另以Kostiakov、Horton兩種經驗式及Philip、Swartzendruber 四種模式來模擬試驗所得之數據，就整體而言，以Swartzendruber模式較適於作為本研究試區中靜態滲透觀測之計算模式。 百喜草覆蓋區，因其根系屬直根系，且其根長可達 1. 8 公尺，故土壤中垂直孔隙較為發達，又因有蒸散作用，土壤之臨前水分減少，雨後能大量吸收水量，補充土壤水分，並能立即滲漏至底層，故降雨後測滲計底部出水管首先有滲流流出，且流量最多，此亦表示植生覆蓋處理，對有限度延遲集流時間、降低洪峰流量及補充地下水源，有正面之效應。 以 1976 年至 1995 年之水文觀測資料，利用水文收支模式，建立年降雨量對地表逕流、地下滲流及蒸發散量之迴歸方程式組，適用於對年水文收支之預測，此對今後坡地土壤之水分管理及依據降雨量推估流量之變化，應有參考之價值。封面 中文摘要 英文摘要 目錄 圖 目 錄 表 目 錄 符號說明 一 前言 二 前人研究 三 入滲之理論基礎 3. 1 土壤水分流動方程式 3. 2 Philip 入滲公式之推導 四 材料與方法 4. 1 試驗材料 4. 2 試驗方法 4. 2. 1 水文循環之觀測 4. 2. 2 飽和導水率之測定 4. 2. 3 田間入滲觀測 4. 2. 4 入滲之模擬 4. 2. 4. 1 Kostiakov模式 4. 2. 4. 2 Horton模式 4. 2. 4. 3 Philip模式 4. 2. 4. 4 Swartzendruber模式 4. 2. 5 覆蓋作物與敷蓋材料截留量之測定 五 結果與討論 5. 1 降雨量與逕流量及滲透量之關係 5. 2 降雨量前後土壤水分含量之變化 5. 3 滲透 5. 3. 1 靜態滲透觀測 5. 3. 2 動態滲透觀測 5. 4 降雨量與蒸發散量之關係 5. 5 坡地土壤水文收支平衡方程式 六 結論 參考文...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the great}} goals of CTA is to bring {{together}} dispersed information and knowledge {{and to make it}} available to a large number of users. This is particularly important when dealing with the problems caused by the drought in the Sahel, which is why CTA published the first livestock atlas covering all the arid areas of the Sudan. CTA entrusted the task to CIRAD-EMVT which, since 1958, has mapped over 2. 0 m km 2 of the Sahel. French, British and Sudanese scientists pulled together their efforts in order to publish this atlas, which incorporates extensive data on livestock and their development. The atlas is a synthesis of livestock and pasture potential of the regions of the Sudan where rainfall averages between 70 and 500 mm per annum. The publication responds to a perceived need for this kind of information among national research services and decision-makers, as well as among international development and aid agencies. The atlas contains comprehensive information on animal-rearing and its development in a region where climatic conditions play a paramount role. It is a follow-up of a survey carried out, in French and under the sponsorship of CTA, of seven West African countries situated in dry tropical zones. It is part of a series which includes a compilation of the common climatic elements for an animal-rearing area spreading from the Atlantic to the Ethiopian border. The Sudan atlas covers twelve subjects which highlight two main themes. The first is a study of the environment and comprises the following topics: general presentation, phyto-geography and botany, climate and soils, feed resources, range use, cropping, water resources, pastoral production and economy and livestock movements. The second part deals with human activity, livestock resources, animal health and veterinary services. The study covers more than 800, 000 km 2. The atlas also contains an agro-pastoral map at 1 : 500, 000, in twelve sheets. The publication will provide planners with a reliable information source and agricultural authorities with an important tool for monitoring natural resources. Furthermore, this work helps to identify the information gaps that still need to be explored. Sudan, with an area of more than 2. 5 m km 2 is Africa's largest country. Its population has increased rapidly during the last 20 years. From 15 million inhabitants in 1970, it has grown to an estimated 27. 3 million today. Sudan controls only the middle section of the Nile but this river dictates the country's present and future patterns of land use and provides 96 % of the <b>annual</b> surface <b>run-off</b> (estimated at 136. 5 cubic km). The Sudanese economy is based primarily on agriculture and pastoralism. Together these contribute 35 % of GNP and employs 70 % of the labour force. Most of the livestock are raised under nomadic or semi-nomadic conditions but these herds men are gradually becoming settled and are increasingly turning to cultivation. The atlas contains 33 pages, of which 12 are devoted to a cartographical survey. It features the orohydrography of the region an essential data on climate, population distribution and economic factors. It includes two maps of the vegetation of Sudan, one based on the classification made by Harrison and Jackson in 1958 and the other made by IEMVT in 1986 - 1987. The use of aerial photography from the Landsat satellite complements this information. The atlas has been produced by the department of Livestock Production and Veterinary Medicine of the French-based Centre for International Cooperation in Agricultural Development Research (CIRAD-EMVT), in collaboration with the Range Pasture Administration of the Sudan. The section on water resources was produced by the Geological and Mining Research Bureau (BRGM). Several institutions have provided assistance to CIRAD-EMVT in the production of the atlas: in the United Kingdom the Natural Resources Institute (NRI), Overseas Development Administration (ODA), Durham University and Bangor University; in the Republic of Sudan, the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural and Animal Resources, the Forestry Department, and the Rural Water Department. The authors were A Durag, (DVM, Director, Range Pasture Administration) F El Moulah (Range Scientist, Range Pasture Administration), G. Forgiarini (Remote Sensing Specialist, CIRAD-EMVT), H I Khatab (DVM, Ministry of Agriculture and Natural and Animal Resources), G Lamarque (Cartographer, CIRAD-EMVT), M El Sammani (Socio-Economist, University of Khartoum), G Tacher (Director, CIRAD-EMVT), H Torrent (Hydrogeologist, BRGM) and G Uilenberg (Scientific Director - Animal Health, CIRAD-EMVT). The scientific editors were J C Bille (Range Ecologist) and R T Wilson (Animal Scientist/Natural Resources Ecologist). The technical production was carried out at CIRAD-EMVT. CTA provided financial support because of its mandate to disseminate scientific and technical information in order to aid the formulation of development strategies by ACP countries. The socio-economic importance of pastoralism in the Sudan, and the need to protect an exceptionally fragile ecosystem, were additional factors which led CTA to support this publication. atla...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of aggregate stability on run-off and erosion {{has often been}} reported from experiments on microplots (about 1 m 2) under simulated rain. Our objective was to compare the aggregate stability of topsoil (0 - 10 cm) with run-off and erosion from experiments on run-off plots (about 100 - 1000 m 2) under natural rain. Run-off and soil losses were measured over three years on 14 plots in Benin, Cameroon and Mexico. All plots were under herbaceous vegetation and had moderate slope length and slope declivity, but differed in climate (400 - 1600 mm annual rainfall), soil type (sandly clay loam Nitosol, loamy sand Ferralsol, loamy Regosol), and management (from savanna to long-duration mouldboard ploughing). The stability of aggregates was determined by immersing and wet-sieving 2 -mm sieved air-dried samples into water. Mean <b>annual</b> <b>run-off</b> rate and soil losses generally increased, {{and the proportion of}} stable macroaggregates (greater than 0. 2 mm) decreased, with increasing duration and intensity of tillage, and with decreasing cover on the soil surface. For all 14 plots, run-off and soil losses were closely correlated with aggregate stability; correlations were improved when slope gradient and climate aggressivity were considered in addition to aggregation. Slaking, the main mechanism of aggregate breakdown wich occurs when dry soil is immersed, accounted well for run-off and erosion. The stability of topsoil aggregates seems therefore to be a valuable indicator of field-assessed run-off and erosion for plots on moderate slopes with herbaceous vegetation. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Observations of high-elevation {{meteorological}} conditions, glacier mass balance, and glacier run-off are sparse {{in western}} Canada and the Canadian Rocky Moun-tains, leading to {{uncertainty about the}} importance of glaciers to regional water resources. This needs to be quantified so that the impacts of ongoing glacier recession can be eval-uated with respect to alpine ecology, hydroelectric opera-tions, and water resource management. In this manuscript the seasonal evolution of glacier run-off is assessed for an alpine watershed on the continental divide in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The study area is a headwaters catchment of the Bow River, which flows eastward to provide an impor-tant supply of water to the Canadian prairies. Meteorologi-cal, snowpack, and surface energy balance data collected at Haig Glacier from 2002 to 2013 were analysed to evaluate glacier mass balance and run-off. Annual specific discharge from snow- and ice-melt on Haig Glacier averaged 2350 mm water equivalent from 2002 to 2013, with 42 % of the run-off derived from melting of glacier ice and firn, i. e. water stored in the glacier reservoir. This is an order of magnitude greater than the annual specific discharge from non-glacierized parts of the Bow River basin. From 2002 to 2013, meltwater de-rived from the glacier storage was equivalent to 5 – 6 % of the flow of the Bow River in Calgary in late summer and 2 – 3 % of annual discharge. The basin is typical of most glacier-fed mountain rivers, where the modest and declining extent of glacierized area in the catchment limits the glacier contribu-tion to <b>annual</b> <b>run-off.</b> ...|$|E

The evaluation results of this monthly hydrological model using readily available, monthly GCM data are consistent with studies on nearby catchments employing high-temporal resolution data, indicating that useful hydro-climatic planning studies may be possible using standard datasets and modest computational resources. HyMOD was calibrated against 5 [*]km 2 gridded UK Climate Projections dataset data and then driven using monthly spatially interpolated (~ 5 [*]km 2) outputs from Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 and the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis for Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (IPCC-SRES) A 2 a and B 2 a covering the 2020 s, 2050 s and 2080 s. Results for both GCMs project a decrease in <b>annual</b> <b>run-off</b> in both GCM models and scenarios with higher values in the summer/autumn months, whereas an increase in the later winter months. Both Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 and the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis show higher ranges of uncertainty during the winter season with higher values of run-off associated with December in all three simulation periods and two scenarios. A seasonal comparison of run-off simulations shows that both GCMs give similar results in summer and autumn, whereas disparities due to GCM uncertainties are more conspicuous in winter and spring. In this study, both the GCMs under A 2 a scenario have demonstrated the high possibility of time shift in monthly average peak run-offs in the Derwent River by 2080 s in comparison with the early 21 st century...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} we have {{modelled}} the mass balance of two Norwegian glaciers using two different approaches. At Storbreen, a continental glacier in southern Norway, a simplified energy balance model was used. At Engabreen, a maritime glacier in northern Norway, a degree day model was used. Both glaciers have long term mass balance series, detailed topographic maps, micro-meteorological data and nearby meteorological stations outside the glacier. The {{models have been}} calibrated with micro-meteorological data from the glacier (Storbreen only), and by traditional mass balance measurements. Downscaled climate scenarios were used {{to predict the future}} climate for the two glaciers. Results from the atmosphere-ocean general circulation models ECHAM 4 /OPYC 3 developed at the Max Planck Institute and the HadAm 3 H developed at the Hadley Centre were used. Assumptions about future greenhouse gas emissions were based on the IPCC SRES B 2 scenario. The period 1961 - 1990 was used as control climate and for the future climate the time slice 2071 - 2100 was used. The downscaled climate scenarios show a mean temperature increase between the two periods of between 2. 2 and 3. 3 K for Storbreen and between 2. 3 and 2. 7 K for Engabreen. The precipitation is predicted to increase by 3 - 23 % for Storbreen and between 7 and 48 % for Engabreen. The climate sensitivity was calculated by combining calculated Seasonal Sensitivity Characteristics and normalised and smoothed seasonal scenario values. This resulted in a mean temperature sensitivity of Storbreen and Engabreen of - 0. 50 and - 0. 90 m w. e. respectively for a 1 K warming. A 10 % increase in precipitation represents a climate sensitivity of + 0. 17 m w. e. for Storbreen. For Engabreen the sensitivity varies between + 0. 51 and + 0. 38 m w. e. using the Max Planck and the Hadley scenario respectively. Based on the climate change scenarios and the calculated static climate sensitivities, we estimate that Storbreen will have lost about 30 % of its volume by around 2050. The volume estimates of Engabreen range from a 4 % increase by 2100 (using the MaxPlanck scenario) to a 30 % decrease within 2056 (using the Hadley scenario). The extra <b>annual</b> <b>run-off</b> will be larger from Engabreen than Storbreen due to its much bigger size, by 2050 it will be in the order of 4 mill. m 3 water from Storbreen and 50 mill. m 3 water from Engabreen...|$|E
40|$|The Bushmans Estuary {{is one of}} the few {{permanently}} open estuaries in the Eastern Cape that {{is characterized}} by large intertidal salt marshes. Freshwater inflow to the estuary has decreased as a result of abstraction by more than 30 weirs and farm dams in the catchment. The mean <b>annual</b> <b>run-off</b> is naturally low (38 x 106 m 3 y- 1) and thus abstraction and reduction of freshwater inflow to the estuary is expected to cause a number of changes. The aims of this study were to determine the current health/status of the estuary based on the macrophytes and microalgae and identify monitoring indicators for the East London Department of Water Affairs, River Health Programme. Changes in the estuary over time were determined from available historical data which were compared with present data. This analysis showed that under normal average conditions freshwater inflow to the estuary is very low, less that 0. 02 m 3 s- 1 most of the time. Under these conditions the estuary is in a homogenous marine state. Vertical and horizontal salinity gradients only form when high rainfall and run-off occurs (> 5 m 3. s- 1). Salinity gradients from 30. 1 PSU at the mouth to 2. 2 PSU in the upper reaches were measured in 2006 after a high flow event. However the estuary quickly reverted back to its homogenous condition within weeks after this flood. This study showed that freshwater inflow increased nutrient input to the estuary. Total oxidised nitrogen (TOxN) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations were higher in August 2006, after the flood, than during the other low flow sampling sessions. TOxN decreased from a mean concentration of 21. 6 μM in 2006 to 1. 93 μM in February 2009. SRP decreased from 55. 3 μM to 0. 2 μM respectively. With the increased nutrient availability, the response in the estuary was an increase in phytoplankton biomass. After the 2006 floods the average water column chlorophyll-a was 9. 0 μg l- 1, while in the low freshwater inflow years it ranged from 2. 1 to 4. 8 μg l- 1. The composition of the phytoplankton community was always dominated by flagellates and then diatoms, with higher cell numbers in the nutrient-enriched 2006 period. Although the water column nutrient data indicated that the estuary was oligotrophic, benthic microalgal biomass (11. 9 - 16. 1 μg. g- 1) in the intertidal zone was comparable with nutrient rich estuaries. Benthic species indicative of polluted conditions were found (Nitzschia frustulum, Navicula gregaria, Navicula cryptotenelloides). These benthic species were found at the sites where wastewater / sewage seepage had occurred. Benthic diatom species also indicated freshwater inflow. During the high flow period in 2006 the dominant diatoms were fresh to brackish species that were strongly associated with the high concentrations of TOxN and SRP (Tryblionella constricta, Diploneis smithii, Hippodonta cf. gremainii, and Navicula species). During the freshwater limited period of 2008 and 2009 the benthic diatom species shifted to a group responding to the high salinity, ammonium and silicate concentrations. The species in this group were Nitzschia flexa, Navicula tenneloides, Diploneis elliptica, Amphora subacutiuscula and Nitzschia coarctata. Ordination results showed that the epiphytic diatom species responded to different environmental variables in the different years. Most of the species in 2008 / 2009 were associated with high salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, ammonium and silicate concentrations while the response was towards TOxN and SRP in 2006. The dominant species were Cocconeis placentula v euglyphyta in 2006; Nitzschia frustulum in 2008; and Synedra spp in 2009. The average biomass of the epiphytes was significantly lower in May 2008 than in both August 2006 and February 2009; 88. 0 + 17. 7 mg. m- 2, 1. 7 + 0. 8 mg. m- 2, and 61. 8 + 14. 4 mg. m- 2 respectively. GIS mapping of past and present aerial photographs showed that submerged macrophyte (Zostera capensis) cover in 1966 and 1973 was less than that mapped for 2004. Salt marsh also increased its cover over time, from 86. 9 ha in 1966 to 126 ha in 2004, colonizing what were bare sandy areas. Long-term monitoring of the health of the Bushmans Estuary should focus on salinity (as an indicator of inflow or deprivation of freshwater), benthic diatom identification and macrophyte distribution and composition (for the detection of pollution input), and bathymetric surveys (for shallowing of the estuary due to sedimentation) ...|$|E
