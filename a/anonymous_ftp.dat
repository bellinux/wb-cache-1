40|$|Equations {{of motion}} for N = 4 supergravity with antisymmetric tensor from its {{geometric}} description in central charge superspace Sébastien GURRIERI 1 and Annamária KISS 2 We consider the geometrical formulation in central charge superspace of the N = 4 supergravity containing an antisymmetric tensor gauge field. The theory is on-shell, so clearly, the constraints {{used for the}} identification of the multiplet together with the superspace Bianchi identities imply equations of motion for the component fields. We deduce these equations of motion in terms of supercovariant quantities and then, we give them in terms of component fields. These equations of motion, deduced from the geometry, without supposing the existence of a Lagrangian, are found to be the same as those derived from the Lagrangian given in the component formulation of this N = 4 supergravity multiplet by Nicolai and Townsend.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{a new model}} for calculating the total energy of atomic and solid systems is presented. The model is used to study the {{properties}} of the Si(100) surface and dislocation dynamics in the diamond structure. For the Si(100) surface the main result is the finding of an incomplete melted state at $ 1550 ^ 0 K$. The studied dislocation is the $ 90 ^ 0 $ partial and it is found that the barriers for kink formation and migration are in good accordance with experimental observations. The general idea for calculating the total energy for a given system is to relate a reference system to each atom, an effective medium for which the total energy is known and then only calculate the energy difference between the two systems. Using transferable potentials and densities a pair potential is constructed which describe the electro-static and exchange-correlation part of the energy difference. The remaining part, the one-electron difference, is calculated with an LMTO tight-binding model with the potential parameters determined from the effective potential of the reference system.

40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} written to perform several analyses of radar altimeter data. The program was designed to improve on previous methods of analysis of altimeter engineering data by (1) facilitating and accelerating the analysis of large amounts of data in a more direct manner and (2) improving the ability to estimate performance of radar-altimeter instrumentation and provide data corrections. The data in question are openly available to the international scientific community and can be downloaded from <b>anonymous</b> file-transfer- protocol (<b>FTP)</b> locations that are accessible via links from altimetry Web sites. The software estimates noise in range measurements, estimates corrections for electromagnetic bias, and performs statistical analyses on various parameters for comparison of different altimeters. Whereas prior techniques used to perform similar analyses of altimeter range noise require comparison of data from repetitions of satellite ground tracks, the present software uses a high-pass filtering technique to obtain similar results from single satellite passes.

40|$|Motivation: The {{advent of}} the World Wide Web has enabled {{unprecedented}} supplementation of traditional journal publications, allowing access to resources, such as video, sound, software, databases, datasets too large to publish, and even supplementary information and discussion. However, unlike traditional publications, continued availability of these online resources is not guaranteed. An automated survey was conducted to quantify the growth in Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) published to date in MEDLINE abstracts, their current availability and distribution by journal. Results: Of 1630 unique URLs identified, formatting and/or spelling errors were detected within 201 (12 %) of them as published. After corrections were made, a survey revealed that ∼ 63 % of these URLs were consistently available, and another 19 % were available intermittently.

40|$|We present {{preliminary}} {{results of our}} investigation into the influence of shear fields {{on the evolution of}} galactic scale fluctuations in a primordial Gaussian random density field. Specifically, we study how the matter associated with a galaxy-scale peak evolves, to determine whether the shear can affect the peak's ability to form a virialized structure. We find that the evolution of the mass distribution in the immediate surroundings of ≥ 1 σ initial density peaks is sensitive to the nature and magnitude of the shear. Its final fate and configuration spans a plethora of possibilities, ranging from accretion onto the peak to complete disruption. On the other hand, the mass defining the peak itself always tends to form a virialized object, though a given galaxy-scale peak need not necessarily form only one halo. Furthermore, galaxy-size halos need not necessarily be associated with initial galaxy-scale density peaks. Under certain conditions, the shear field is capable of breaking up a single primordial peak into two (and perhaps, more) distinct halos, or of promoting the growth of smaller-scale peaks into galaxy-size halos.

40|$|This {{documents}} {{describes the}} MLgraph system, a library for producing images in ML. This library is currently available via <b>ftp</b> <b>anonymous</b> {{as an extension}} to Caml Light [9]. The graphical model which is used in MLgraph is basically that of PostScript [2],[1]. Various objects can be defined on the infinite cartesian plane and arbitrarily scaled, translated and rotated by the application of linear transformations. Each category of graphical objects corresponds to an ML type. A type picture is used to represent all printable objects. Pictures have a "frame" and possibly a set of named "handles" that are used for combination operations. Pictures are defined from more basic objects such as geometric elements (lines, arcs and curves), texts and bitmaps. All operations defined on these types are purely functional except for pixel editing in bitmaps. Printing is obtained via a translation to PostScript. The philosophy of this translation has been to delegate as much work as possible to PostScript. In particular, all applications of linear transformations to pictures are delegated to the PostScript interpretor. This has two advantages: the efficiency of PostScript interpretors is fully used and the sharing involved in the ML representation of pictures is preserved as much as possible.

40|$|We {{present the}} kinematical data {{obtained}} for {{a sample of}} active (Seyfert) and non active isolated spiral galaxies, based on long slit spectra along several position angles in the Halpha line region and, in some cases, in the Ca triplet region as well. Gas velocity distributions are presented, together with a simple circular rotation model that allows to determine the kinematical major axes. Stellar velocity distributions are also shown. The main result is that active and control galaxies seem to be equivalent in all kinematical aspects. For both subsamples, the departure from pure circular rotation in some galaxies {{can be explained by}} the presence of a bar and/or of a spiral arm. They also present the same kind of peculiarities, in particular, S-shape structures are quite common near the nuclear regions. They define very similar Tully-Fisher relations. Emission line ratios are given for all the detected HII regions; the analysis of the [NII]/Halpha metallicity indicator shows that active and non-active galaxies have indistinguishable disk metallicities. These results argue in favour of active and non-active isolated spiral galaxies having essentially the same properties, in agreement with our previous results based on the analysis of near infrared images. It appears now necessary to confirm these results on a larger sample.

40|$|We present {{techniques}} for identifying and analyzing galaxy groups {{and show that}} they provide a powerful discriminator between cosmological models. We apply these to high-resolution PM N-body simulations of structure formation in CHDM (cold/hot/baryon fractions=. 6 /. 3 /. 1, b= 1. 5 (COBE norm) and two CDM models; b= 1. 5 and b= 1. 0 (COBE norm). Groups are identified with the Nolthenius (1993) algorithm. We find: (1) Properties of groups are a powerful and robust discriminator between these Gaussian models whose spatial and velocity properties differ on Mpc scales. We test robustness against several methods for assigning luminosity to dark matter halos, for merging CfA 1 galaxies, and for breaking up massive over-mergers (2) When allowance is made for the high large scale power P(k) present in the CfA 1 data, CHDM at our = 0. 30 produces slightly too many groups and groups too high {{a fraction of the}} galaxies, while the fraction grouped in CDM is far too low. Lowering would appear to produce close agreement with all measures, save one: for all simulations, median group sizes are x 1. 4 - 1. 7 larger than equivalently selected CfA 1 groups. (3) The standard group M/L method gives Ω≃ 0. 1 for CHDM and CfA 1, and Ω≃ 0. 35 for CDM. A conspiracy of three effects produce these very low values, and we conclude that low observed Ω's need not argue for a low Ω universe. When overmergers are broken up, the median virial- to-DM mass of 3 D selected groups is ∼ 1 for all simulations. M_DM> 10 ^ 14 groups appear virialized in all simulations. Global velocity biases b_v are similar to previous studies. Within 3 D-selected groups, CHDM and CDM b= 1. 5 show a stronger bias of b_v= 0. 7 - 0. 8, while CDM b= 1. 0 shows group b_v's ≃ 1.

40|$|The TERRAscope {{project of}} the California Institute of Technology began in 1988 and now has six very {{broadband}} seismic stations (PAS, GSC, PFO, SBC, ISA, and SVD) in southern California (Figure 1). The goal of TERRAscope is to provide high-quality broadband data needed for significant advances in both regional and global seismology. TERRAscope will replace the old Caltech seismographic network in southern California, which {{dates back to the}} 1920 s. In many cases, new stations are deployed in cooperation with local institutions. The goal is to encourage involvement of both students and researchers in the operation of the stations and analysis of new data. The station PAS is a joint project between Caltech, the University of Southern California, the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS). The station SBC was deployed in cooperation with the University of California at Santa Barbara. The station PFO is operated jointly with the University of California at San Diego, and the station SVD was installed and is operated by the USGS. Except for SVD, all of the stations are equipped with a broadband Streckeisen STS- 1 seismometer and Quanterra data logger with a 24 -bit digitizer and a Kinemetrics FBA- 23 strong-motion sensor. The station SVD has a Streckeisen STS- 2 seismometer and a Guralp CMG- 5 accelerograph. The project is funded mainly by grants from the L. K. Whittier Foundation and the Arco Foundation. In addition to the automatic dial-up data retrieving system called Caltech Gopher (adapted from the IRIS Gopher system) has been implemented. The Caltech Gopher receives mail from NEIC for teleseisms and the SCSN with origin time, location, and magnitude for regional events. The Gopher retrieves data from all six TERRAscope stations for these events. The TERRAscope data reside in an <b>FTP</b> <b>anonymous</b> account (seismo. gps. caltech. edu; password: “your e-mail address”) at the Caltech Seismological Laboratory, and are available to users through Internet.
