40|$|The SraP adhesin of Staphylococcus aureus is {{a member}} of a highly conserved family of serine-rich surface glycoproteins of gram-positive bacteria. For streptococci, export of the SraP homologs {{requires}} a specialized transport pathway (the <b>accessory</b> Sec <b>system).</b> Compared to streptococci, however, SraP is predicted to differ in its signal peptide and glycosylation, which may affect its dependence on a specialized system for transport. In addition, two genes (asp 4 and asp 5) essential for export in Streptococcus gordonii are missing in S. aureus. Thus, the selectivity of the <b>accessory</b> Sec <b>system</b> in S. aureus may also differ compared to streptococci. To address these issues, the five genes encoding the putative <b>accessory</b> Sec <b>system</b> (secY 2, secA 2, and asp 1 - 3) were disrupted individually in S. aureus ISP 479 C, and the resultant mutants were examined for SraP export. Disruption of secA 2 resulted in the near complete loss of SraP surface expression. Similar results were seen with disruption of secY 2 and asp 1, asp 2, or asp 3. To assess whether the <b>accessory</b> Sec <b>system</b> transported other substrates, we compared secreted proteomes of ISP 479 C and a secA 2 isogenic mutant, by two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis. Although two consistent differences in proteome content were noted between the strains, neither protein appeared to be a likely substrate for accessory Sec export. Thus, the <b>accessory</b> Sec <b>system</b> of S. aureus is required for the export of SraP, and it appears to be dedicated to the transport of this substrate exclusively...|$|R

40|$|The <b>accessory</b> {{olfactory}} <b>system</b> {{contributes to}} the perception of chemical stimuli in the environment. This review summarizes {{the structure of the}} <b>accessory</b> olfactory <b>system,</b> the stimuli that activate it, and the responses elicited in the receptor cells and in the brain. The <b>accessory</b> olfactory <b>system</b> consists of a sensory organ, the vomeronasal organ, and its central projection areas: the accessory olfactory bulb, which is connected to the amygdala and hypothalamus, and also to the cortex. In the vomeronasal organ, several receptors—in contrast to the main olfactory receptors—are sensitive to volatile or nonvolatile molecules. In a similar manner to the main olfactory epithelium, the vomeronasal organ is sensitive to common odorants and pheromones. Each accessory olfactory bulb receives input from the ipsilateral vomeronasal organ, but its activity is modulated by centrifugal projections arising from other brain areas. The processing of vomeronasal stimuli in the amygdala involves contributions from the main olfactory system, and results in long-lasting responses that {{may be related to the}} activation of the hypothalamic– hypophyseal axis over a prolonged timeframe. Different brain areas receive inputs from both the main and the <b>accessory</b> olfactory <b>systems,</b> possibly merging the stimulation of the two sensory organs to originate a more complex and integrated chemosensory perception...|$|R
40|$|The <b>accessory</b> {{olfactory}} <b>system</b> {{is present}} in most tetrapods. It {{is involved in the}} perception of chemical stimuli, being implicated also in the detection of pheromone. However, it is sensitive also to some common odorant molecules, which have no clear implication in intraspecific chemical communication. The <b>accessory</b> olfactory <b>system</b> may complement the main olfactory system, and may contribute different perceptual features to the construction of a unitary representation, which merges the different chemosensory qualities. Crosstalk between the main and <b>accessory</b> olfactory <b>systems</b> occurs at different levels of central processing, in brain areas where the inputs from the two systems converge. Interestingly, centrifugal projections from more caudal brain areas are deeply involved in modulating both main and accessory sensory processing. A high degree of interaction between the two systems may be conceived, and partial overlapping appears to occur in many functions. Therefore, the central chemosensory projections merge inputs from different organs to obtain a complex chemosensory picture...|$|R
