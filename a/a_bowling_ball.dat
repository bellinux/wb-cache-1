5|$|Homer, having {{forgotten}} Marge's birthday, rushes {{out to buy}} her {{a present}} at the Springfield Mall. He finds <b>a</b> <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> and decides to buy it for her. During the night of her birthday dinner at the Singing Sirloin, Marge is happy with the kids' presents of French perfume from Bart and a macaroni and glue card of her as the Mona Lisa from Lisa. However, she is offended by Homer's gift as it is another demonstration of his thoughtless gift giving history, which her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier had reminded her of earlier. To make matters worse, as he presents his 'gift', it bursts through its box and squashes Marge's birthday cake. Deeply resentful, Marge reminds him that not only has she never gone bowling in her life, but the ball is also inscribed with his name.|$|E
25|$|Grizzly {{bears are}} {{especially}} dangerous {{because of the}} force of their bite, which has been measured at over 8 megapascals (1160 psi). It {{has been estimated that}} a bite from a grizzly could even crush <b>a</b> <b>bowling</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|E
25|$|The USBC {{completed}} {{data analysis}} and released a lengthy report {{on its website}} (www.bowl.com) {{to the public in}} the spring of 2008. As of April 1, 2009, The USBC now regulates the chemical surface roughness of all bowling balls manufactured for certified ten-pin bowling. This specification is a direct result from the ball motion study, as the surface roughness of the coverstock of <b>a</b> <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> was the number one variable (out of 18) that affected the strength (how much a ball hooks) of <b>a</b> <b>bowling</b> <b>ball.</b> The radius of gyration specification has also been tightened and went into effect in 2010. For up to date information on ball specifications, check the USBC Equipment Specifications website at http://bowl.com/equipandspecs/index.jsp.|$|E

5000|$|<b>As</b> <b>bowling</b> <b>balls</b> {{are quite}} heavy to throw, some alleys provide {{portable}} slides {{from the top}} of which the ball is pushed down rather than thrown. Use of these slides is often combined with the use of bumpers. These slides are used by children and the disabled to assist their throw. They are also referred to as [...] "ramps".|$|R

25|$|Pendulums {{are used}} in science {{education}} to demonstrate the law of conservation of energy. A heavy object such as <b>a</b> <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> or wrecking ball {{is attached to a}} string. The weight is then moved to within a few inches of a volunteer's face, then released and allowed to swing and come back. In most instances, the weight reverses direction slightly before the position it was released from, and the volunteer is unharmed. On occasion, the volunteer does not stand still and is injured.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2007, the USBC {{completed}} a two-year study on bowling ball motion and how advanced, high-tech equipment may influence lane conditions and scoring. Establishing <b>a</b> <b>Bowling</b> <b>Ball</b> Specifications Task Force—comprising research engineers and volunteers from ball manufacturing companies—the USBC sought {{to better understand the}} motion of bowling balls using scientific research and data analysis. Test equipment included, but was not limited to, a robotic ball-thrower, a Computer Aided Tracking System ("Super C.A.T.S."), 59 reactive resin and particle bowling balls from various manufacturers, and eight lanes in a climate-controlled facility.|$|E
500|$|The couch gag is a {{reference}} to the James Bond gun barrel sequence. Dr. Hibbert's flashback hairstyle is modeled after Arsenio Hall's. The family watches Knight Boat, a parody of Knight Rider. Homer spinning around with <b>a</b> <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> in his hand before throwing it into the air and exclaiming [...] "I'm gonna make it after all" [...] is reminiscent of the opening of The Mary Tyler Moore Show where Mary throws her hat into the air.|$|E

500|$|The first segment, [...] "The Devil and Homer Simpson", {{was written}} by Daniels and McGrath. The first time Devil Flanders appears, he looks {{the same as the}} devil Chernabog from the 1940 Walt Disney {{produced}} film Fantasia; Silverman particularly admired the animation in that sequence. Oakley loved the idea of Flanders being the Devil because he is the one you would least expect. He also thought Harry Shearer {{did a good job of}} playing Flanders in a much darker way, while remaining very true to the character. Many scenes had to be cut to shorten the segment, including one that showed Homer's severed head being used as <b>a</b> <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> by a demon in hell. This scene later appeared in the clip show episode [...] "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular", which aired in the show's seventh season.|$|E
500|$|The {{sequence}} {{in which the}} family throws the pizza box away was specifically designed by John Swartzwelder to look surreal, with the family panning into each other. The moon was designed to resemble <b>a</b> <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> in the scene in which Jacques drops Marge home. The restaurant that Jacques and Marge attend is called [...] "Shorty's"; it was originally intended that a chef's hat would be shown moving around in the background, implying that the owner was short, but the concept was dropped as {{it seemed to be}} too much of a silly idea. The episode's conclusion is a reference to An Officer and a Gentleman, which David Silverman had to watch first, so that he knew how to set the scene out. Homer's line, [...] "too exciting", when he sees the lingerie store was written by James L. Brooks. During Marge's phone conversation with Patty and Selma, Maggie can be seen sucking her pacifier repeatedly, a concept dropped in later episodes as it was deemed too much of a distraction from the dialogue.|$|E
500|$|The tale was {{the basis}} for a story in The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales by Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith, wherein the prince decides to slip <b>a</b> <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> {{underneath}} one hundred mattresses after three years of unsuccessful attempts with the pea. In the morning, the princess comes downstairs and tells the queen, [...] "This might sound odd, but I think you need another mattress. I felt like I was sleeping on a lump as big as a bowling ball." [...] which satisfies the king and the queen. The princess gets married to the prince, and they live happily, though maybe not completely honestly, ever after. American poet Jane Shore published a poem, [...] "The Princess and the Pea", in the January 1973 issue of Poetry, in which a close dependency between princess and pea is posited: [...] "I lie in my skin as in an ugly coat: / my body owned by the citizens / who ache and turn whenever I turn / on the pea on which so much depends" [...] (13-16). Russian writer Evgeny Shvarts incorporates the story, with two other Andersen stories, in his Naked King.|$|E

In this segment, Cramer explains {{how he has}} come up with a [...] "play" [...] to take advantage of news from other stocks as a sort of [...] "pin action" [...] play.

2500|$|Most closers {{depend on}} one pitch that becomes synonymous with their success: Trevor Hoffman's changeup, Mariano Rivera's cut fastball. [...] Gagné thrives on the dizzying {{oscillation}} between his changeup and his fastball. They {{have the same}} release point and the same arm speed. The fastball is straight gas ... but the changeup is a devious thing, <b>a</b> <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> rolled off a picnic table. It travels some 10 mph slower than his fast-ball, anywhere from 83 to 88 mph, and like a splitter it breaks late and sharp.|$|E
2500|$|Ten-pin bowling is a {{sport in}} which a player (called a [...] "bowler") rolls <b>a</b> <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> down a wood-structure or {{synthetic}} (polyurethane) lane and towards ten pins positioned {{at the end of}} the lane. The objective is to score the highest pinfall by knocking down as many pins as possible. Three finger holes are drilled into a traditional bowling ball, and weights vary considerably to make the sport playable for all ages. Generally, the heavier the ball, the more pins that will topple on two equivalent shots. The pins are arranged in a triangular position by an automated machine. While professional ten-pin bowling tournaments are held in numerous countries, the sport is commonly played as a hobby by millions of people around the world.|$|E

500|$|To {{achieve the}} point-of-view of <b>a</b> rolling <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> the Coen {{brothers}} mounted a camera [...] "on {{something like a}} barbecue spit", according to Ethan, and then dollied it along the lane. The challenge for them was figuring out the relative speeds of the forward motion and the rotating motion. CGI was used to create {{the vantage point of}} the thumb hole in the <b>bowling</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|R
2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> is a {{piece of}} {{sporting}} equipment used to hit bowling pins in the sport of bowling. Balls used in ten-pin bowling are typically hard spheres with three holes drilled in them, one each for the ring and middle fingers, and one for the thumb.Regulating bodies such as the USBC maintain requirements for the properties of bowling balls, including size, hardness, and number of holes, as well as maintaining a list of bowling balls approved for competitive play. Other bowling balls, such as those used in five-pin bowling, candlepin bowling, and duckpin bowling are smaller, lighter, and without holes, so that they may be held in the palm of the bowler's hand. Most bowling alleys provide balls for patrons to use within the establishment, often referred to as [...] "house balls." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{legitimate}} strongman, Ferraro {{has performed}} feats of strength for numerous {{television and radio}} shows in New England, and at public events throughout the world. Often referred to as [...] "Hammer Head" [...] or [...] "The Human Anvil", his specialty is breaking heavy objects such as concrete cinderblocks over his head. An assistant is generally used to drop bowling balls or operate a jackhammer or sledge. He has also encouraged 300 pound wrestlers to stand on his chest while lying {{on a bed of}} nails. In 2010, he was featured on Stan Lee's Superhumans. Less than a year later one of his demonstrations in Milan, Italy, aired on Lo show dei record, set the Guinness World Record for the most concrete blocks (45) broken on the head with <b>a</b> <b>bowling</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In the [...] "Profanity" [...] episode, Penn {{tells the}} viewers that the planned title for Bullshit! was Humbug! This, Penn {{goes on to}} say, relates their {{skepticism}} (and TV show) to Harry Houdini's reactions to the popular misconceptions of his day; but the idea was scrapped because humbug had less of an impact than the more profane, more informal word, bullshit. It is also discussed during the profanity episode that humbug was considered as profane at one time as bullshit today. During that same episode, Penn and Teller themselves did not use any profanity, even changing {{the name of the}} show to Humbug! for that episode. At one point, Penn suggests the use of the phrase Jesus Christ! by a non-Christian is not profanity, but as Teller apparently drops <b>a</b> <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> on his foot just as he mentions the phrase, his yelling of the expression makes its use ambiguous. (See [...]) ...|$|E
50|$|Billy injured {{the third}} finger {{of his right}} hand in a machine shop {{accident}} while in high school. As a result, this finger would not bend, making it impossible to use <b>a</b> conventional <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> grip (thumb, third finger, and ring finger). Instead, he used his thumb and first two fingers.|$|R
5000|$|Philip Edward Cooper (19 February 1885 [...] - [...] 21 May 1950) was an English {{first-class}} cricketer, {{who played}} one match for Yorkshire County Cricket Club.

Large ornate neo-classical style bars for saloons were <b>a</b> popular product. <b>Bowling</b> <b>balls,</b> pins, and equipment led a growing line of sporting equipment. It popularized <b>bowling</b> <b>balls</b> of manufactured materials, vulcanized rubber at first; earlier <b>bowling</b> <b>balls</b> had been solid wood.|$|R
2500|$|Holes {{are allowed}} to be drilled into <b>a</b> <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> {{for a variety of}} reasons, and bowlers must be able to {{demonstrate}} that such holes can be used as claimed. Up to five holes may be drilled for the bowler's fingers for one hand, and each finger hole may have a small additional hole that intersects for ventilation. A [...] "balance hole" [...] may be added to alter the mass distribution. [...] The USBC recently changed their rules that affect no-thumb bowlers more than those using a conventional grip. [...] Now any hole not used explicitly for gripping during the approach is to be considered a balance hole and only one balance hole is allowed. [...] This means that no-thumb bowlers would have to take out their thumb hole or their balance hole if they have both. [...] This is because it may give them the advantage of special weighting, which can help give the ball a higher spin rate. [...] A [...] "mill hole" [...] may also be used for inspection purposes.|$|E
