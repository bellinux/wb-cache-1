5|$|After {{the guns}} were fired, each rifle barrel {{had to be}} cleaned. Unlike small caliber guns which can be field-stripped, the guns aboard an Iowa-class {{battleship}} could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned the job of cleaning the rifles required a full day or more {{to ensure that the}} barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned. To clean the rifles, <b>a</b> <b>bore</b> brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through the rifle with the same equipment used to load the shells. Within the turret, crewmen checked to ensure that the breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot, and painted over flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the gun barrels.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{with other}} waves, moving into shallow water causes the tsunami to slow but grow in height. Either the trough or {{the crest of the}} tsunami can arrive at the coast first. In the former case, the sea draws back and leaves subtidal areas unusually exposed. When the crest arrives, it does not usually break but rushes inland, {{flooding}} all in its path. Much of the disaster's destruction can be produced by these flood waters, which drain back into the sea while pulling people and debris along. Several tsunamis can be caused by a single geological event. In such cases, it is common for the later waves to arrive between eight minutes and two hours after the first, which may not be the biggest or most destructive. Occasionally, in a shallow bay or estuary, a tsunami may transform into <b>a</b> <b>bore.</b>|$|E

Turnagain Arm boasts the second highest tides in North America after the Bay of Fundy. These tides, which can reach 40 feet (12 meters), come in so quickly that they produce a wave known as <b>a</b> <b>bore</b> tide. Adventurous kayakers and surfers have taken to riding the tide as an extreme sport. Hikers should take care not to get stuck in the quicksand-like mudflats that otherwise make up the beaches along Turnagain Arm.|$|E
25|$|One {{candidate}} is the Heilongjiang hand cannon, discovered in 1970, and {{named after the}} province of its discovery, Heilongjiang, in northeastern China. It is small and light like the Xanadu gun, weighing only 3.5 kilograms, 34cm (Needham says 35cm), and <b>a</b> <b>bore</b> of approximately 2.5cm. Based on contextual evidence, historians believe it was used by Yuan forces against a rebellion by Mongol prince Nayan in 1287. The History of Yuan states that a Jurchen commander known as Li Ting led troops armed with hand cannons into battle against Nayan.|$|E

25|$|The second {{design is}} the top-entry holder {{consists}} of a cartridge that is several cm long with <b>a</b> <b>bore</b> drilled down the cartridge axis. The specimen is loaded into the bore, possibly using a small screw ring to hold the sample in place. This cartridge is inserted into an airlock with the bore perpendicular to the TEM optic axis. When sealed, the airlock is manipulated to push the cartridge such that the cartridge falls into place, where the bore hole becomes aligned with the beam axis, such that the beam travels down the cartridge bore and into the specimen. Such designs are typically unable to be tilted without blocking the beam path or interfering with the objective lens.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s Scott {{manufactured}} {{a number}} of stationary engines {{with the aim of}} raising funds following the decline in motorcycle sales. Some of these engines were derived from motorcycle units, for instance the DSE was a watercooled version of the Lightweight Squirrel engine and the SE had the same bore and stroke dimensions as the long stroke Flyers. It has come to light that the SE does not have the same bore size as the Long Stroke Flyer (73mm) but has <b>a</b> <b>bore</b> size of 78mm, this has been confirmed on two Scott SE engines. The PA stationary engine however was different. Designed to meet a Ministry requirement for a portable electrical generator for the Bofors anti-aircraft gun and its Kerrison Predictor, it was produced during the Second World War by both Scott and its former partners Jowett.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, 1847, Rodman was {{promoted}} to first lieutenant, and {{was promoted}} {{to the rank of}} captain on July 1, 1855. Rodman experimented for almost a decade at the Fort Pitt Foundry in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, testing his theory and performing trial runs of his cannon barrels. After viewing the results, the U.S. War Department approved construction of a fifteen-inch smoothbore columbiad of Rodman's design in 1859. On December 23 a prototype was cast, and it test fired 509 times without incident. The following year he supervised its construction at the foundry, and once complete it was shipped for testing to Fortress Monroe at Old Point Comfort on the Virginia Peninsula. It tested successfully there in March 1861, but due to its size and weight it would be destined for permanent, fixed positions, and not suitable for field service nor naval use. The specifications of this gun were: overall length of fifteen feet, ten inches long; and <b>a</b> <b>bore</b> length of thirteen feet, nine inches; total weight around 50,000 pounds. This design, capable of firing either shell or shot, would be the base for most of the Rodman guns that followed.|$|E
