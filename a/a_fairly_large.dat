5|$|Geschwaderkommodore Major Gerhard Michalski {{commanded}} the force. Five pilots {{were shot down}} by ground fire. Another pilot got lost during the flight and ended up near Eindhoven where he was shot down and killed. Reduced in number, 8–10 fighters of IV./JG 4 continued to their target. After 10 minutes, they located <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> airfield and attacked, believing it to be Le Culot. It was in fact Sint-Truiden.|$|E
5|$|According to Tino's account, {{on the day}} of the election, Selvo was {{attending}} mass for the funeral of the late Doge at the new monastery church of San Nicolò built under Domenico Contarini on Lido, an island in the Venetian Lagoon. The location was ideal for the funeral of a Doge not only because St Mark's Basilica was under construction at the time, but the new church was also spacious enough to hold <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> number of people. The location also proved ideal for the election of a new Doge for the very same reasons.|$|E

5|$|The Eriskay Pony {{developed}} in the Hebrides, a group of western isles in Scotland. The origins of the breed are ancient, with roots in Celtic and Norse breeding. It is physically similar to drawings of ponies on ancient Pictish stones found in north and west Scotland. It is related to other northern breeds, including the Icelandic horse and the Faroe pony. The Eriskay {{takes its name from}} the island of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides. Originally, the breed had <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> population, and until the mid-19th century the Eriskay and similar ponies were found throughout the western islands of Scotland. They were used as crofters' ponies, as pack animals, for light draught and as mounts for children.|$|E
5|$|The grey jay (Perisoreus canadensis), also gray jay, Canada jay, or whisky jack, is a {{passerine}} bird of {{the family}} Corvidae. It is found in boreal forests of North America north to the tree line, and in the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone south to New Mexico and Arizona. <b>A</b> <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> songbird, the grey jay has pale grey underparts, darker grey upperparts, and a grey-white head with a darker grey nape. It {{is one of three}} members of the genus Perisoreus, a small genus more closely related to the Cyanopica genus of magpies than to other birds known as jays. The grey jay itself has nine recognized subspecies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the past}} {{part of the}} {{population}} worked in coal mining, although there are no working mines in the area now. There is still <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> agricultural workforce and in light industry or service industries, although many people commute to surrounding cities for work. According to the 2011 Census the valley has a population of approximately 5,000, largely living in one of the dozen or so villages and in isolated farms and hamlets. The average age of the population is 42 years, with unemployment rates of 1–4% of all economically active people aged 16–74, however these figures are approximations because the ward areas covered and described in the census statistics do not relate exactly to the area of the valley. In the Indices of deprivation 2010 all of the areas within the valley were considered to be in the most affluent third in England.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> {{family of}} <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> wading birds. The avocets have long legs and long up-curved bills. The stilts have {{extremely}} long legs and long, thin, straight bills. There are about 10 species worldwide, with two recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|R

5|$|NGC 1664 is <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> open cluster, with a {{diameter}} of 18 arcminutes, and moderately bright, with a magnitude of 7.6, comparable to several other open clusters in Auriga. One open cluster with a similar magnitude is NGC 1778, with a magnitude of 7.7. This small cluster has {{a diameter}} of 7 arcminutes and contains 25 stars. NGC 1857, a small cluster, is slightly brighter at magnitude 7.0. It has {{a diameter of}} 6 arcminutes and contains 40 stars, making it far more concentrated than the similar-sized NGC 1778. Far dimmer than the other open clusters is NGC 2126 at magnitude 10.2. Despite its dimness, NGC 2126 is as concentrated as NGC 1857, having 40 stars in a diameter of 6 arcminutes.|$|E
5|$|Noronhomys vespuccii was <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> rodent, {{larger than}} the black rat (Rattus rattus). A {{member of the family}} Cricetidae and {{subfamily}} Sigmodontinae, it shares several distinctive characters with Holochilus and related genera within the tribe Oryzomyini, including high-crowned molars with simplified crown features and the presence of several ridges on the skull which help anchor the chewing muscles. Although a suite of traits suggest that Holochilus is its closest relative, it is distinctive in many ways and is therefore classified in a separate genus, Noronhomys. Its close relatives, including Holochilus and Lundomys, are adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle, spending much of their time in the water, but features of the Noronhomys bones suggest that it lost its semiaquatic lifestyle after arrival at its remote island.|$|E
5|$|Scuba diving {{fatalities}} have a {{major financial}} impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs. Equipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba, and when {{the cause of death}} is recorded as drowning, it is usually the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events in which drowning is the endpoint because it occurred in water, while the initial cause remains unknown. Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, often as a consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent, occasionally aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research which could improve diver safety.|$|E

The abundance and renewable character of the plant material make it an attractive source for this rare, psychoactive alkaloid. The availability of glaziovine and its 0 -methyl derivative pronuciferine (2) has made complete H- 1 and C- 13 NMR assignments of proaporphines possible for the first time...|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} of the Inner Court varied over different periods, but by all accounts it was large. Each queen consort had her own household of around 200 to 300 women. Her various ladies-in-waiting were usually recruited from noble families; others were minor princesses who would also have a retinue of servants. Each minor wife or consort (เจ้าจอม; Chao Chom) had <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> household; this would increase significantly if {{she gave birth to}} the king's child, as she would be elevated to the rank of consort mother (เจ้าจอมมารดา; Chao Chom Manda). Each royal lady had a separate establishment, the size of which was in proportion to her rank and status in accordance with palace law. Altogether the {{population of}} the Inner Court numbered nearly 3,000 inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|IC 410, a faint nebula, is {{accompanied}} by the bright open cluster NGC 1893. The cluster is thin, with a diameter of 12 arcminutes and a population of approximately 20 stars. Its accompanying nebula has very low surface brightness, partially because of its diameter of 40 arcminutes. It appears in an amateur telescope with brighter areas {{in the north and}} south; the brighter southern patch shows a pattern of darker and lighter spots in a large instrument. NGC 1893, of magnitude 7.5, is classified as a Trumpler Class II 3 r n or II 2 m n cluster, meaning that it is not very large and is somewhat bright. The cluster possesses approximately 30 stars of magnitude 9–12. In an amateur instrument, IC 410 is only visible with an Oxygen-III filter. NGC 2281 is a small open cluster at a distance of 1,500 light-years. It contains 30 stars in a crescent shape. It has an overall magnitude of 5.4 and <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> diameter of 14.0 arcseconds, classified as a Trumpler Class I 3 m cluster. The brightest star in the cluster is magnitude 8; there are approximately 12 stars of magnitude 9–10 and 20 stars of magnitude 11–13.|$|E

25|$|Cheshire is {{considered}} to be an affluent county. However, towns such as Crewe have significant deprivation. The county's proximity to the cities of Manchester and Liverpool means counter urbanisation is common. Cheshire West has <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> proportion of residents who work in Liverpool and Manchester, while the town of Northwich and area of Cheshire East falls more within Manchester's sphere of influence.|$|E
40|$|We {{provide a}} full {{characterisation}} of the large-maturity forward implied volatility smile in the Heston model. Although the leading decay {{is provided by}} <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> classical <b>large</b> deviations behaviour, the algebraic expansion providing the higher-order terms highly depends on the parameters, and diff erent powers of the maturity come into play. As a by-product of the analysis we provide new implied volatility asymptotics, both in the forward case and in the spot case, as well as extended SVI-type formulae. The proofs are based on extensions and re finements of sharp large deviations theory, in particular in cases where standard convexity arguments fail...|$|R
