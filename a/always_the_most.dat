5|$|Although motte-and-bailey castles are {{the best}} known castle design, they were not <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{numerous}} in any given area. A popular alternative was the ringwork castle, involving a palisade being built {{on top of a}} raised earth rampart, protected by a ditch. The choice of motte and bailey or ringwork was partially driven by terrain, as mottes were typically built on low ground, and on deeper clay and alluvial soils. Another factor may have been speed, as ringworks were faster to build than mottes. Some ringwork castles were later converted into motte-and-bailey designs, by filling in the centre of the ringwork to produce a flat-topped motte. The reasons for why this decision was taken are unclear; motte-and-bailey castles may have been felt to be more prestigious, or easier to defend; another theory is that like the terpen in Netherlands, or Vorburg and Hauptburg in Lower Rhineland, raising the height of the castle was done to create a drier site.|$|E
25|$|A Brahman {{who becomes}} a priest (pedanda) is {{entitled}} to a larger residence, called griya. Similarly, royal families are entitled a puri ("palace"). Both griya and puri consist of multiple courtyards instead of single courtyard. These multiple courtyards, similarly surrounded by pavilions, create its own subdivision within the extensive house compound. Each subdivision follows the same importance, and so the subdivision located in the kaja-kangin direction is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> auspicious where {{the most important of}} the family shrines are usually located. In a royal palace, each courtyard compound corresponds to a specific use relating to royal duties. Despite the complexity of a griya or a puri, spatial orientation and hierarchical organization principle remains the same: the kaja-kangin is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> auspicious corner. Principally, the consistent spatial orientation and hierarchy of Balinese traditional houses, whether it is the most lavish or the most humblest, are harmoniously linked with each other.|$|E
25|$|It may {{be simple}} {{to write down}} the {{equations}} of motion in vector form using Newton's laws of motion, but the components may vary in complicated ways with spatial coordinates and time, and solving them is not easy. Often there is an excess of variables to solve for the problem completely, so Newton's laws are not <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> efficient way to determine the motion of a system. In simple cases of rectangular geometry, Newton's laws work fine in Cartesian coordinates, but in other coordinate systems can become dramatically complex.|$|E

25|$|IGN rated Supreme Commander {{with the}} rating of 9/10, with {{reviewer}} Charles Onyett giving {{the game the}} Editor's choice award. Particularly the intuitive and helpful strategic zoom and base automation were praised, though the steep hardware requirements and naval pathfinding issues were found less appealing—while they would {{find their way to}} their designated target point, their routes were not <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> efficient. IGN UK, however, was less positive, while still awarding a rating of 8.9/10. The issues addressed by its international counterpart were deemed more severe, and the reviewer was not impressed by the interface, finding the amount of control it gives over the game lacking.|$|E
25|$|Linear {{magnification}} M is not <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> useful {{measure of}} magnifying power. For instance, when characterizing a visual telescope or binoculars that produce only a virtual image, {{one would be}} {{more concerned with the}} angular magnification—which expresses how much larger a distant object appears through the telescope compared to the naked eye. In the case of a camera one would quote the plate scale, which compares the apparent (angular) size of a distant object {{to the size of the}} real image produced at the focus. The plate scale is the reciprocal of the focal length of the camera lens; lenses are categorized as long-focus lenses or wide-angle lenses according to their focal lengths.|$|E
25|$|CCDC130 has two conserved domains and a coiled-coil region. The {{first is}} the COG5134 domain which {{is found to be}} conserved in {{cucumbers}} and likely plays a role in the function of the protein because it is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> highly conserved region in any multiple sequence alignment. It spans approximately the first 170 amino acids of the protein. The other domain is the DUF572 domain, which is a eukaryotic domain of unknown function that is shared by all of the orthologs and a majority of the more distant homologs. This domain doesn't have a defined range, as different sources have reported different lengths, some saying that it is the entire protein. The coiled-coil region is from 182-214 in the human protein and is rich in charged amino acids. The modified residues are also very well conserved.|$|E

25|$|NBA 2K16 again, for {{the fourth}} time in the series, {{features}} MyTeam mode. MyTeam mode was first introduced in NBA 2K13, and is based around the idea of building the ultimate basketball team, and maintaining a virtual trading card collection. Players build their own custom team, selecting the players, current and past, jerseys, coach, court, and other basketball related things, and play with their team in basketball tournament-style competitions against other players' teams. Players collect cards that unlock players, playbooks, and other items {{that can be used in}} their team or sold. Players purchase card packs with Virtual Currency (VC) which gives the player random items. Cards have different levels that indicate how good the card is. A player will commonly receive Bronze cards if they purchase cheaper card packs. However, if the player purchases high priced packs, the chances of getting Gold cards are higher. There are also rare cards, such as Amethyst and Diamond cards, that are rarer and better than other cards. The level of a card isn't <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important factor as the abilities of the actual player, and their rating indicating how good they are, is most often more important. Players can freely customize their team on the fly; players may change the coach, players, jerseys, and anything else at any time. Customization aspects were touted as being the major improvements for the mode.|$|E

500|$|Advertisements for {{the show}} ahead of the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con {{featuring}} a flaming chain led to speculation that the character Ghost Rider would be joining the series during the season, though {{it was noted that}} the image could just indicate an increased role for Whitehead after he was introduced as James in the third season, and also wields a flaming chain. When casting for two Latino brothers, [...] "one of whom is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> dangerous person in the room, the other paralyzed in a wheelchair", was revealed to be underway for the series in June, further speculation pointed to the inclusion of Ghost Rider, with those character descriptions resembling those for Marvel Comics' All-New Ghost Rider Robbie Reyes and his brother Gabe, respectively. At the series' Comic-Con panel, the speculation was confirmed—Gabriel Luna was announced to be cast as Robbie Reyes, and Lorenzo James Henrie was later revealed to be cast as Gabe.|$|E
500|$|Robert {{accompanied}} Edward the Confessor on Edward's recall to England in 1042 {{to become}} king following Harthacanute's death. It {{was due to}} Edward that in August 1044 Robert was appointed Bishop of London, {{one of the first}} episcopal vacancies which occurred in Edward's reign. Robert remained close to the king and was the leader of the party opposed to Earl Godwin, Earl of Wessex. Godwin, for his part, was attempting to expand the influence of his family, which had already acquired much land. His daughter was Edward's queen, and two of his sons were elevated to earldoms. The Life of Saint Edward, a hagiographical work on King Edward's life, claimed that Robert [...] "was <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> powerful confidential adviser of the king". Robert seems to have favoured closer relations with Normandy, and its duke. Edward himself had grown up in the duchy, and spent 25years in exile there before his return to England. He brought many Normans with him to England, and seems to have spent much time in their company.|$|E

[...] Ono was responsible for the background designs used in the series, and he used photographs and classical paintings as references. 3D CGI was used in the creation of certain backgrounds and settings for the series, such as the Hall of Mirrors.|$|E
2500|$|Both Chinese and Japanese {{tradition}} {{have developed}} a range of terms to describe the glaze colours and qualities; some of the Japanese ones {{have the advantage of}} being anchored to specific pieces in Japan. The term kinuta (砧青瓷) meaning [...] "mallet", probably after a particular mallet vase, represents the most admired blue-green colour from the Song period, and is often used in English, while tenryūji has a [...] "a faint yellowish-green tone", and is from the Yuan and Ming. The shickikan type is from the middle Ming, after the glaze became more transparent. [...] As with other celadons, for the Chinese the similarity of the colour to jade, <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> prestigious material in Chinese art, was an important factor in their appeal, and something the potters attempted to increase.|$|E

In 2014, Drowned in Sound Marc Burrows called the song an exploration of Wainwright's sexuality.
