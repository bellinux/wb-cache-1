The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] paper proposes a technique, called Smell-driven performance analysis (SDPA), which automatically provides situated explanations within a visual dataflow language IDE to help end-user programmers to overcome performance problems without leaving the visual dataflow paradigm. An experiment showed SDPA increased end-user programmers’ success rates at finding performance problems and decreased the time required for finding solutions. Another study, based on using SDPA to analyze a corpus of example end-user programs, revealed that it is usually accurate at identifying performance problems. Based on these results, we conclude that SDPA provides a reliable basis for helping end-user programmers to troubleshoot performance problems, as well as a potential foundation for future work aimed at training users and at <b>aiding</b> <b>code</b> reuse...|$|R

40|$|Ultrasonic {{stress wave}} {{amplitude}} and time-of-flight values change drastically as a media is heated. The measurement of relatively small variations in velocity and material attenuation can detect and quantify significant variations within a material microstructure. This paper discusses experimental setups, ultrasonic wave speed tracking methods and signal analysis algorithms that document the changes within highly attenuative wax material {{as it is}} either being heated or cooled from 25 ˚C to 90 ˚C. The experimental set-up utilizes ultrasonic probes in a pulse-echo and through-transmission configuration. The ultrasonic waveforms are recorded and analyzed during long duration thermal experiments. To complement the ultrasonic data, a Discontinuous-Galerkin Model (DGM) was also created which uses unstructured meshes to determine how waves travel in these anisotropic media. This numerical method solves particle motion travel using partial differential equations and outputs a wave trace per unit time. Both experimental and analytical data is compared and presented. Finally, the paper describes a series of additional experiments that are currently under investigation which will <b>aid</b> <b>code</b> development to adjust for density variations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{advances}} in static and dynamic program analysis resulted in tools capable to detect {{various types of}} security bugs in the Applications under Test (AUTs). However, any such analysis is designed for a priori specified types of bugs and it is characterized by some rate of false positives or even false negatives and certain scalability limitations. We present a new analysis and source code classification technique, and a pro-totype tool aiming to <b>aid</b> <b>code</b> reviews in the detection of general information flow dependent bugs. Our approach is based on classifying the criticality of likely exploits in the source code using two measuring functions, namely Severity and Vulnerability. For an AUT, we analyse every single pair of input vector and program sink in an execution path, which we call an Information Block (IB). A classification technique is introduced for quantifying the Severity (danger level) of an IB by static analysis and computation of its En-tropy Loss. An IB’s Vulnerability is quantified using a tainted object propagation analysis along with a Fuzzy Logic system. Possible exploits are then characterized {{with respect to their}} Risk by combining the computed Severity and Vulnerability measurements through an aggregation operation over two fuzzy sets. An IB is characterized of a high risk, when both its Severity and Vulnerability rankings {{have been found to be}} above the low zone. In this case, a detected code exploit is reported by our prototype tool, called Entroine. The effectiveness of our approach has been tested by analysing 45 Java programs of NIST’s Juliet Test Suite, which implement three different common weakness exploits. All existing code exploits were detected without any false positive. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{architectural}} parameterization has long neglected other parameterizations {{in favour of}} code selector descriptions. In this dissertation, we are concerned with providing linguistic notations for modelling architectures with special emphasis on translation. We focus on high level descriptions to <b>aid</b> <b>code</b> selection and storage allocation. The view taken in the thesis is that a description specializes a framework with a particular architecture. Independently, the framework must support other translation algorithms without constraining their freedom or forcing them towards architecture-specific idioms. The first contribution is an architectural description language with features tuned towards better parameterizability. Emphasis is laid on addressing site (compile time) parameterizability. Within the notation, the type system of the machine is decoupled {{from that of the}} language with the mapping being left to the user as a compile-time parameterization. This gives one more degree of freedom for the user to decide on the precision required based on the available realizations. We also give adequate representation to addressing modes. They are considered to be almost equivalent to operations in complexity. This makes the specification simpler for operations. From the framework's perspective, as a second contribution, we propose an algorithm for maintaining registers during allocation. Register allocation algorithms depend on the framework to inform them when registers are exhausted. In such a situation, we pro- pose an adaptation of bipartite graph matching to keep track of register usage during translation in the presence of architec- tural constraints. The research also aims at structuring both the specification and software to prevent the closed-syntax bottle- neck of a lot of specification languages. We also describe the architecture of the implementation in terms of a very flexible model called the blackboard model...|$|E
30|$|A year later, the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) {{published}} a report (Macnair 1995) commissioned {{by a group}} of agencies looking at levels of organisational support for expatriate aid workers. As the title “Room for Improvement” suggested, the report uncovered weaknesses across a range of human resources management practices in the sector, leading to both poor performance by staff and a reduction in the quality of programmes (Macnair 1995). The report fed into a much larger project, culminating in the publication 2  years later of the “People In <b>Aid</b> <b>Code</b> of Best Practice in the Management and Support of Aid Personnel” (People in Aid 2003), aimed at equipping managers and human resources advisors. Like much of the writing at the time, the report focused mainly on practical occupational health challenges but did not consider the emotional or relational challenges. In 1998, the stress management unit of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) published its findings (de Haan 1998) on the impact of psychological debriefing on returning workers and a year later, the British Medical Journal (BMJ) featured an article (McCall and Salama 1999) on the selection, training and support needs of aid workers, noting that their mental health and the impact of their work was still relatively unstudied. At around the same time, the ICRC (de Haan 2001) along with the United Nations (UNHCR 2001) and other large agencies (Fawcett 2003) began releasing more comprehensive stress management manuals for aid workers. In 2004, the publication of the “Guidelines for Good Practice: Managing Stress in Humanitarian Workers” (Antares Foundation 2012), a collaboration between the Antares Foundation in the Netherlands and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the USA, represented a new level of conceptual sophistication in humanitarian staff care frameworks. As occasional articles and chapters (Danieli 1996) on the welfare of aid workers became whole books devoted entirely to this area (Ehrenreich 1999), it seemed that the physical and psychological health of humanitarians had become established as a discrete domain of research and study. An initial focus on practical stress management, however, was soon to evolve.|$|E
