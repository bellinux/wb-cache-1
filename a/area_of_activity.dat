The city has a supermarket and a hypermarket, as well as several superettes and other discounters. The hypermarket, which is of recent construction, belongs to the Système U group and is located in the new <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> of Ramilles. The supermarket (Intermarché) is, meanwhile, close to the city centre. Markets, vestiges of the traditional markets of the city are many, taking place on Wednesday (textile, utility, etc.) at Place Chaptal, and on Saturday mornings (food market) at Place Chaptal and Place Urbain V.

25|$|Aix-les-Bains {{has nearly}} 500 shops. These are, {{for the largest}} number, present in the town centre. Merchants benefit from the {{attractiveness}} of the geographical situation of the commune with {{the proximity of the}} lake and the Massif des Bauges, but also thanks to the casino. However, its aging image as well as competition from neighbouring communes tend to undermine the Aix shops. Indeed, the peripheral communes such as Tresserve, Grésy-sur-Aix, Albens or even Le Bourget-du-Lac attract ever slightly more local clientele. On the other hand, the Chambéry area is facing competition from the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> of Les Landiers, where most of the big names are, such as Darty, la Halle aux vêtements, Feu vert, but also the large Carrefour hypermarket. This presence has forced the town of Chambéry to revitalize its own town centre. Aix-les-Bains shops have, in this general situation, struggled to survive and attract potential customers.|$|E
25|$|The {{vascular}} arterial system supplying {{fresh blood}} branches into {{smaller and smaller}} vessels as it enters the brain surface and within-brain regions, culminating in a connected capillary bed within the brain. The drainage system, similarly, merges into larger and larger veins as it carries away oxygen-depleted blood. The dHb contribution to the fMRI signal is from both the capillaries near the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> and larger draining veins that may be farther away. For good spatial resolution, the signal from the large veins needs to be suppressed, since it does not correspond to {{the area where the}} neural activity is. This can be achieved either by using strong static magnetic fields or by using spin-echo pulse sequences. With these, fMRI can examine a spatial range from millimeters to centimeters, and can hence identify Brodmann areas (centimers), subcortical nuclei such as the caudate, putamen and thalamus, and hippocampal subfields such as the combined dentate gyrus/CA3, CA1, and subiculum.|$|E

It is rather the disillusionment, because no road, sanitary and school infrastructure worthy of the name has emerged. These populations whose main activities are fishing, harvesting and agriculture have seen their <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> polluted by the different boreholes, making their living conditions unbearable. In addition to the decline in agricultural yields (cassava, yams, plantains) that allow Pointe-Noire to be supplied, water points have also been polluted making water unfit for food use. ENI's only solution is to supply water by tanker trucks whose vats are not always curated. Even this distribution is done at the head of the customer by favoring those who have relationships or money.|$|E
25|$|Seismic {{activity}} {{continued to}} be strong in October. The eruption continued apace, subsidence of the caldera continued at about 40cm per day and the earthquakes continued with regular M5 tremors around the caldera rim and smaller tremors at the eruption site. Larger volumes of sulphur dioxide were emitted. A crater named Baugur and a new lava flow to the east formed at the eruption site in Holuhraun. Geothermal heat was on the increase and the depression in the caldera was 40 metres, subsidence continued at a similar rate to previous weeks. A cauldron in the south-east corner of Bárðarbunga deepened 25 metres in one month and was considered by scientists at the site {{to be linked to}} the depression in the caldera. Seismic activity continued in the dyke although at a reduced rate. GPS measurements around the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> showed minor changes.

25|$|The Ansei Treaties {{included}} stipulations {{restricting the}} <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> open to foreign residents, and in Kobe this consisted {{of an area}} of ten ri (about 40km) around the Hyōgo prefectural office. In 1869, the prefecture released regulations concretely defining this 10-ri area in terms of actual travel distance, bounded by the sea {{to the south and}} by villages on all sides: to the east by Ōbe, Sakane, Hirai, and Nakashima in Kawabe District, the west by Sone and Amida in , and the north by Ōharano-mura in Kawabe District, Kawahara, Yado, Yakamishimo, and Inugai in , and Takō, Myōrakuji, and Yokō in Taka District. However, the foreign countries instead interpreted the ten ri as a radius of direct distance, expanding the treaty limits to encompass the entirety of Innami to the west and Kawabe, Taki, and Taka districts to the north. The space beyond this area was accessible to foreigners only for recreation and scholarship, and when foreigners did enter it they were obligated to carry a travel license from the prefectural office. In actuality, though, foreigners often left the treaty area without permission on excursions, which frequently caused trouble for the prefecture. When the settlement was returned in 1899, foreigners were permitted to reside and travel freely within Japan.|$|E

25|$|In 1890 he {{presented}} his cableway in Switzerland, a country {{very interested in}} that transport owing to its geography and which was already coming to use cable cars for bulk transport, but Torres's project was dismissed, allowing certain ironic commentary from the Swiss press. In 1907, Torres constructed the first cableway suitable for the public transportation of people, in Monte Ulía in San Sebastián. The problem of safety was solved {{by means of an}} ingenious system of multiple support cables. The resulting design was very strong and perfectly resisted the rupture of one of the support cables. The execution of the project was the responsibility of the Society of Engineering Studies and Works of Bilbao, which successfully constructed other cableways in Chamonix, Rio de Janeiro, and elsewhere. But it is doubtless the Spanish Aerocar in Niagara Falls in Canada which has gained the greatest fame in this <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> although from a scientific point of view it was not the most important. The cableway of 580 meters in length is an aerial cable car that spans the whirlpool in the Niagara Gorge on the Canadian side, constructed between 1914 and 1916, a Spanish project from beginning to end: devised by a Spaniard, constructed by a Spanish company with Spanish capital (The Niagara Spanish Aerocar Co. Limited); a bronze plaque, located on a monolith at the entrance of the access station recalls this fact: Spanish aerial ferry of the Niagara. Leonardo Quevedo Torres (18521936). It was inaugurated in tests on 15 February 1916 and was officially inaugurated on 8 August 1916, opening to the public the following day; the cableway, with small modifications, continues to run to this day, with no accidents worthy of mention, constituting a popular tourist and cinematic attraction.|$|E

500|$|The greater noctule bat {{is known}} to {{participate}} in a fission-fusion society. These societies vary in size, but studies show that each society has a social order and a territory in a specific group of trees that are used for roosting and breeding. The greater noctule bat has been shown to travel between several roosting sites and to participate in several societies through radio tracking studies. [...] It has been conjectured that ranking in society dictates different roles in society, e.g. some bats are scouts, others are hunters. [...] There has been correlation between a specific bat's social ranking and the size of that bat's potential home range; the higher the social ranking, the lower the home range. The greater noctule bat has an observed active range of 2500km2. {{which is one of the}} largest observed ranges for any bat species. This large <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> has several effects on the way the greater noctule bat forages and roosts. It has been noted that changes by humans to the natural environment could have had an effect on the way the greater noctule bat travels and roosts in its attempts to find suitable food sources. It has been noted that a lack of roosting sites near food sources could be the reason for the large home range that is displayed by the greater noctule bat. Differences observed between two populations of bats with drastically different habitats, Great Britain and Spain respectively, show that the greater noctule bat would not travel great distances for food unless absolutely necessary. This need to fly great distances for food has been theorized as a reason for the decline of the species. One study reported finding a greater noctule bat on the ground exhausted from flight. Another study of owl droppings found in areas in between GNB roosting sites has shown that the greater noctule bat is susceptible to predation in flight.|$|E

The bull-breeding industry attained a level of sophistication {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century, through the influence of the Corvelo and Barcelos whom conquered the market for the purposes of Terceiran bullfighting. These cattle families would regularly transport their animals to holding pens through the streets of the village.

[...] The 1965 eruption was classified as phreatomagmatic, generated by the interaction of magma with the lake water that produced the violent explosion that cut an embayment on Volcano Island. The eruption generated [...] "cold" [...] base surges which traveled several kilometers across Lake Taal, devastating villages on the lake shore and, killing about a hundred people. That eruption, in particular, led to the recognition of base surge (one of the American geologists who witnessed an atomic bomb explosion as a soldier and visited the volcano shortly after the 1965 eruption, compared it to an atomic base surge) as a process in volcanic eruption, which are now called pyroclastic surges when relating to volcanoes. The population of the island was evacuated only after the onset of the eruption. Precursory signs were not interpreted correctly until after the eruption.|$|E
