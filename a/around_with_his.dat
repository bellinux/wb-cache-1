5|$|SpongeBob {{is often}} seen hanging <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> best friend Patrick, who lives on the same street as him. SpongeBob's {{unlimited}} optimistic cheer often leads him to perceive the outcome of numerous endeavors and the personalities of those around him as happier than they actually are; for instance, he believes that Squidward enjoys his company {{in spite of the}} fact that he clearly loathes him. SpongeBob's greatest goal in life is to receive his driver's license from Mrs. Puff's boat driving school, but he panics and crashes whenever he is in a boat. He lives in a submerged pineapple with his pet snail Gary.|$|E

25|$|Regarding human interaction, evil {{of oppression}} and abuse is {{a theme that}} is {{illustrated}} through Curley and Curley's wife. Curley uses his aggressive nature and superior position {{in an attempt to}} take control of his father's farm. He constantly reprimands the farm hands and accuses some of fooling <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wife. Curley's Napoleon complex is evidenced by his threatening of the farm hands for minuscule incidents. Curley's wife, on the other hand, is not physically but verbally manipulative. She uses her sex appeal to gain some attention, flirting with the farm hands. According to the Penguin Teacher's Guide for Of Mice and Men, Curley and Curley's wife represent evil in that both oppress and abuse the migrants in different ways.|$|E
25|$|Sharaf {{was born}} in Aswan Governorate, {{southern}} Egypt on October 22, 1925, the eldest male and the second child of six siblings to a middle class Egyptian family. His father Dr. Mohammed Abdel Aziz Sharaf (Beni Suef Governorate 1889 – Cairo 1953) was a British-educated and trained medical doctor, who earned his Ph.D. in general surgery from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. Dr. Mohammed Abdel Aziz Sharaf had achieved some notability, having been mourned by Egypt’s first post- president General Mohamed Naguib. At {{the time of his}} birth in the mid-Twenties, his father was inspector of health in Beni Suef governorate. His mother Raohia Zaki Saleh (1904 – 1981) was a maternal granddaughter of Hassouna El Nawawy, Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar. She was educated, well versed, a popular socialite, and the daughter of a one-time governor; one source mentioned her father as governor of Suez Governorate. while another mentioned him as the governor of Beni Suef governorate. Moving <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> parents, Sharaf attended several primary and secondary schools in both upper and lower Egypt, the family finally settling in the Cairo suburb of Heliopolis.|$|E
25|$|Standing {{tall and}} {{still at the}} crease, Laxman had a keen {{awareness}} of the off-stump and a polished ability to dispatch the bad ball. He plays with a high elbow and a steady stance and a textbook technique with natural elegance and flair. At {{the start of his}} career, Laxman was rated by Geoffrey Boycott as one of India's best players of the hard (new) ball. However, Indian selectors played <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> batting positions, whenever India felt a lacuna regarding any batting number. He was forced to play in almost every position, including opening. Laxman found his home in the middle order, where he played most of his best innings, batting at numbers 3, 5 and 6. In a 2001 test against Australia and promoted to no. 3 in the second innings from his first innings position of 6, he scored 281 to take India to a huge lead after following on, resulting in a historic win, that also kickstarted an era of India's dominance in test cricket. Though Laxman was ideally suited for No. 3, Rahul Dravid was always preferred over him to bat at one-down. This resulted in Dravid getting opportunities to build partnerships with top and early middle-order batsmen, and score heavily. Laxman, despite being a far more aggressive and attacking batsman than Dravid (and equally skilled, with a similar test temperament), mostly came at no. 6, often finding himself stranded with tail-end batsmen, allowing him lesser number of big partnerships; this reflects in his final statistics, including total runs scored, number of centuries and average. Nevertheless, Laxman made most of this situation by garnering unprecedented support from non-specialist lower-order batsmen to save and win numerous matches for India.|$|E

500|$|Ali Shadman {{is one of}} the few Kurdish people {{remaining}} in Baghdad. His family are struggling financially and resort to siphoning petrol from their car to run their back-up generator when the power grid fails. When the generator breaks down one night, Ali begins to wonder why he is fixing it against a backdrop of gunfire, instead of studying in peace. Another night, he reports the neighbourhood's news but explains there is nothing to speak of other than the usual explosions, violence, and death. Anmar Refat, a Syriac Christian, tries to remain philosophical and hopes that armed gangs will not attack the school. His family, however, are more nervous about any nearby gunfire, as their Christian beliefs increase the threat to their lives if anyone were to find out about them. Anmar has a girlfriend, whom he can contact only via his mobile phone, but he has not heard from her in several days, leaving him worried about whether she has found another boyfriend, or has been hurt in the violence. Hayder Khalid, a Shia Muslim, hopes to become a famous singer-songwriter. He frequently downloads music videos of English-language pop music so he can learn popular English songs and dance moves.

500|$|Andrade {{was born}} on November 3, 1989 in Gómez Palacio, Durango, Mexico, the son of Jose Andrade Salas, who is {{better known as the}} wrestler Brillante. He became part of the third {{generation}} of the Andrade family to compete in lucha libre. His grandfather, Jose Andrade, wrestled under the ring name [...] "El Moro", his father works as Brillante, his uncles wrestle or wrestled under the names Diamante/Moro III (Sergio Andrade), Zafiro/Pentagoncito (real name unrevealed), Kevin (Juan Andrade), Espanto Jr./Pentagón (Jesus Andrade), Espiritu Magico (Juan Andrade) and one of his cousins works as the current Espanto Jr. (real name unrevealed) Due to the secretive nature of lucha libre, where they often do not reveal the real names of masked wrestlers, it is possible that some more of Andrade's siblings or cousins are also professional wrestlers. With his father, uncles and grandfather being involved in running a local lucha libre promotion and school in Durango Andrade began training for a professional career from an early age, initially by playing <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> father and uncles, but later began to train seriously for a career in the wrestling ring. He made his professional wrestling debut on October 3, 2003, a month before his 14th birthday, but only after his father signing a waiver for the local boxing and wrestling commission to issue him a license. He began working under the ring name Brillante Jr. in honor of his father.|$|E
500|$|In February 2003, Case {{temporarily}} {{exited the}} show {{as a result of}} lengthy contract negotiations. Instead of having the character depart permanently (or be killed off), executive producer David Shaughnessy chose to have her leave town after issues with her marriage to Nick. While away, Sharon becomes suicidal; Case explained that Sharon's life had fallen apart and she left town to commit suicide, drinking herself into [...] "a complete stupor". Travelling to Denver, she meets (and has an affair with) businessman Cameron Kirsten (Linden Ashby), who physically abuses her. In April, Case signed a new contract with the show. Executive producer and head writer at the time John F. Smith said that upon Sharon's return to Genoa City, she wants to keep where she was a secret. That December, Sharon is horrified when Cameron arrives in town for apparent business with Newman Enterprises. Smith stated that the story with Cameron and Sharon would be one that [...] "builds quickly into a lot of drama". Explaining their relationship, Ashby revealed that Cameron and Sharon were [...] "kindred spirits" [...] and hooked up, but Cameron becomes abusive, with Ashby calling him [...] "really disturbing". Cameron blackmails Sharon into meeting him at a motel. When she arrives they have a physical altercation in which Sharon throws a bottle at him to keep him from raping her, [...] "killing" [...] him (or so she believes). Australian magazine TV Soap noted that [...] "sweet, demure" [...] Sharon had become a murderer. After driving <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> body in her car trunk for days, she dumps it in an alley.
