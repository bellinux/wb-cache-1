5|$|Sabotage by <b>a</b> <b>disgruntled</b> crewman. While no {{individual}} was {{named in the}} commission's final report, its conclusion was {{that the cause of}} the explosion was most likely a crewman in No. 3 turret who had recently been accused of theft and was believed to be suicidal.|$|E
5|$|Cosme participated as Banderas in the Wrestling Society X {{television}} series (taped in Los Angeles, California), with the gimmick of <b>a</b> <b>disgruntled</b> and kayfabe disfigured man pursuing a feud with Vampiro.

5|$|The IJN {{convened a}} {{commission}} {{three days after}} the sinking to investigate the loss. It issued its preliminary conclusions on 25 June, well before the investigation of the wreck was completed, and decided that the explosion was the result of <b>a</b> <b>disgruntled</b> seaman. The commission failed to consider the possibility of fire, which historian Mike Williams considers to be a possible cause, as a number of observers noted smoke coming from the vicinity of No. 3 turret. The truth, however, will never be known.|$|E
5|$|However, {{during the}} escort mission, Kael disappears and Sykes begins a {{search and rescue}} mission for the missing Captain. Sykes discovers a mortally wounded Kael near his crashed fighter, and it is {{revealed}} that Borvo had shot down Kael after he'd learned of the Hutt's secret plan to sell the escaped prisoners into slavery.

5|$|Tomlinson {{moved to}} the Costa del Sol in Spain for 18 months from early 1996. Realising that <b>a</b> <b>disgruntled</b> former spy could be {{problematic}} for the agency, the aide-de-camp {{to the head of}} MI6 was enlisted to attempt to appease Tomlinson in February 1997. He offered him a £15,000 loan and a marketing job with Jackie Stewart's Formula One racing team, in return for a promise of silence. Tomlinson accepted the offer (he claims under duress) but retained the job for only a few months before he emigrated to Australia, where his younger brother lived.|$|E
5|$|When Ross {{arrived at}} the school, he found no running water, a housing shortage, <b>a</b> <b>disgruntled</b> faculty, and many {{students}} running wild. As Ross began to make improvements, parents began {{to send their children}} to the school in the hopes that they would learn from Ross's example. Although enrollment had always been limited to men, in 1893, Ethel Hudson, the daughter of an A professor, became the first woman to attend classes at the school and helped edit the annual yearbook. She was made an honorary member of the class of 1895. Several years later her twin sisters became honorary members of the class of 1903, and slowly other daughters of Aggie professors were allowed to attend classes.|$|E
5|$|As of September 2017, Adams {{has four}} {{upcoming}} projects.

She will serve as an executive producer for the series and star as Camille Preaker, <b>a</b> <b>disgruntled</b> reporter who returns to her hometown to cover the murder of two young girls. Adams has also committed to star in Backseat, Adam McKay's biopic of the 46th Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney, in which she plays Cheney's wife, Lynne; it will mark her third collaboration with Christian Bale. In addition, she will reprise the role of Giselle in a sequel to Enchanted, entitled Disenchanted.|$|E
5000|$|According to Ric Flair in his {{autobiography}} To Be the Man, The Road Warriors were offered $5,000 to injure the Briscos during a tag team match by <b>an</b> unnamed, <b>disgruntled</b> source.

5|$|The riots {{took place}} {{several days after}} a violent {{incident}} in Shaoguan, Guangdong, where many migrant workers are employed {{as part of a}} programme to alleviate labour shortages. According to state media, <b>a</b> <b>disgruntled</b> former worker disseminated rumours in late June that two Han women had been raped by six Uyghur men. Official sources later said they found no evidence to support the rape allegation. Overnight on 25–26 June, tensions at the Guangdong factory led to a full-blown ethnic brawl between Uyghurs and Hans, during which two Uyghur co-workers were killed. Exiled Uyghur leaders alleged the death toll was much higher. While the official Xinhua News Agency reported that the person responsible for spreading the rumours had been arrested, Uyghurs alleged that the authorities had failed to protect the Uyghur workers, or to arrest any of the Han people involved in the killings. They organised a street protest in Ürümqi on 5 July to voice their discontent and to demand a full government investigation.|$|E
5|$|The sisters {{participated in}} the Battle of Midway in June 1942, {{although}} they did not see any combat. Mutsu saw more active service than her sister because {{she was not a}} flagship and {{participated in the}} Battle of the Eastern Solomons in August before returning to Japan in early 1943. One of Mutsus aft magazines detonated in June, killing 1,121 crew and visitors and destroying the ship. The IJN conducted a perfunctory investigation into the cause of her loss and concluded that it was the work of <b>a</b> <b>disgruntled</b> crewmember. They dispersed the survivors in an attempt to conceal the sinking to keep up morale in Japan. Much of the wreck was salvaged after the war and many artifacts and relics are on display in Japan.|$|E
5|$|After {{speeches in}} favor of the other front-runners, Garfield rose to place Sherman's name in nomination; his nominating speech was well-received, but the delegates mustered little {{excitement}} for the idea of Sherman as the next president. The first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; Sherman's 93 placed him in a distant third. Subsequent ballots quickly demonstrated a deadlock between the Grant and Blaine forces, with neither having the 379 votes needed for nomination. Jeremiah McLain Rusk, a member of the Wisconsin delegation, and Benjamin Harrison, an Indiana delegate, sought to break the deadlock by shifting a few of the anti-Grant votes to a dark horse candidate—Garfield. Garfield gained 50 votes on the 35th ballot, and the stampede began. Garfield protested to the other members of his Ohio delegation that he had not sought the nomination and had never intended to betray Sherman, but they overruled his objections and cast their ballots for him. In the next round of voting, nearly all of the Sherman and Blaine delegates shifted their support to Garfield, giving him 399 votes and the Republican nomination. Most of the Grant forces backed the former president to the end, creating <b>a</b> <b>disgruntled</b> Stalwart minority in the party. To obtain that faction's support for the ticket, former New York customs collector Chester A. Arthur, a member of Conkling's political machine, was chosen as the vice-presidential nominee.|$|E

50|$|On 12 December 1936 <b>a</b> deeply <b>disgruntled</b> Zhang Xueliang kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek in Xi'an {{to force}} {{an end to}} the {{conflict}} between KMT and CCP. To secure the release of Chiang, the KMT was forced to agree to a temporary end to the Chinese Civil War and the forming of a united front between the CCP and KMT against Japan on 24 December 1936.|$|R
50|$|Before Jack and Carly left {{to pursue}} the kidnappers, Jack {{proposed}} to Katie and she said yes. Finally, <b>an</b> injured, <b>disgruntled</b> Jack and ex-wife Carly were able to work off of a lead and tracked the kidnappers down to Idaho. In an action packed chain of events, Carly saved the day, then Jack saved Carly, J.J. was finally freed, Ava ran off with the ransom money, and Silas was arrested.|$|R
5|$|The Queen, {{increasingly}} disdainful of the Marlboroughs and her ministry, {{finally took}} the opportunity to dismiss Sunderland in June 1710. Godolphin followed in August. The Junto Whigs were removed from office, although Marlborough, for the moment, remained as commander of the army. In their place, she appointed a new ministry, headed by Harley, which began to seek peace with France. Unlike the Whigs, Harley and his ministry were ready to compromise by giving Spain to the Bourbon claimant, Philip of Anjou, in return for commercial concessions. In the parliamentary elections that soon followed his appointment, Harley, aided by government patronage, secured a large Tory majority. In January 1711, Anne forced Sarah to resign her court offices, and Abigail took over as Keeper of the Privy Purse. Harley was stabbed by <b>a</b> <b>disgruntled</b> French refugee, the Marquis de Guiscard, in March, and Anne wept at the thought he would die. He recovered slowly. Godolphin's death from natural causes in September 1712 reduced Anne to tears; she blamed their estrangement on the Marlboroughs.|$|E
5|$|When Robbins wins {{a prestigious}} grant to help treat {{children}} in Malawi, <b>a</b> <b>disgruntled</b> Torres agrees to move there with her, as the position {{will last for}} three years; however, her lack of enthusiasm causes Robbins to end their relationship and go without her. A heartbroken Torres moves in with Sloan, {{and they have a}} one-night stand. Robbins returns for Torres, apologizing and hoping for forgiveness, but Torres initially rebuffs her, and later reveals that she is pregnant with Sloan's baby. Robbins agrees to raise the child with her, but dislikes that Sloan will be a permanent part of their lives. En route a weekend getaway, Robbins proposes to Torres, but before Torres can reply, the two are in a head-on collision with a truck, leaving Torres severely injured. In an attempt to save her life, obstetrician-gynecologist Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), delivers Torres's premature baby. Torres survives, and agrees to marry Robbins. After twelve weeks of recovery, both Torres and baby Sofia are discharged and allowed to leave the hospital. Torres recovers from her surgery, but deals with the backlash from her mother (Gina Gallego)'s attitude toward the wedding and her granddaughter. Torres and Robbins marry in a garden after the minister's wife falls ill, with general surgeon Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), officiating the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The Capitol {{has also}} been witness to murder and death. Rep. William P. Taulbee had been a congressman from Kentucky from 1884 to 1888. Charles E. Kincaid, a {{journalist}} for The Louisville Times, had accused Taulbee of adultery and involvement in a Patent Office scandal, which had ruined Taulbee's political career. On February 28, 1890, the ex-congressman and the reporter ran into {{one another in the}} Capitol, and Taulbee assaulted and embarrassed Kincaid by tweaking the much smaller man's nose. Kincaid ran home, grabbed a pistol, and, when he encountered Taulbee on a marble staircase leading from the House chamber down to the dining room, shot him in the face just below Taulbee's left eye. Taulbee died two weeks later, and Kincaid was acquitted after claiming self-defense. Journalists and others claim that whenever a reporter slips on these steps, Taulbee's ghost briefly appears. Former President and then-Rep. John Quincy Adams suffered a stroke at his desk in the House chamber on February 21, 1848, and was taken into the Speaker's Room. His physical condition was too precarious to permit him to be moved, and he died at the Capitol two days later. Many people claim to have heard Adams' ghost denouncing slavery late at night in National Statuary Hall, and one Congressional staff member claims that by standing in the spot where Adams' desk once stood a person can still hear the former president's ghostly whisper. James A. Garfield {{was a member of the}} House from 1863 to 1881 before assuming the Presidency in March 1881. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, <b>a</b> <b>disgruntled</b> office seeker, on July 2, 1881, at 9:30a.m. as he walked through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington, D.C. Garfield died of heart failure brought about by blood poisoning (itself caused by poor medical care) on September 19, 1881, while recuperating at a beach house near Long Branch, New Jersey. Witnesses have seen Garfield's specter walking solemnly through the halls of Congress.|$|E
50|$|Solomon {{has written}} two books. Her first, Get Down, was a {{collection}} of short stories published in 2008. She published her second book, <b>a</b> novel titled <b>Disgruntled,</b> in 2015. Disgruntled was well received by critics.|$|R

5|$|While {{preparing}} for court, attorney Phoenix Wright is attacked from behind, {{resulting in a}} severe case of amnesia. With {{the help of his}} client, policewoman Maggey Byrde, he learns that he is representing her in a case where she faces charges of having murdered her boyfriend, a fellow officer. After narrowly avoiding disaster due to his lack of preparation, Phoenix exposes Richard Wellington, a witness testifying for the prosecution, as the true murderer, saving Maggey. In the aftermath of the trial, he recalls another case that occurred two months prior: Dr. Turner Grey, a private surgeon who lost his reputation due to alleged malpractice, requested his help in contacting Maya Fey, his former secretary who had left the practice to finish training as a spirit medium in her home village. While performing a spirit channeling on Grey's behalf, Maya apparently kills him {{under the influence of the}} spirit's evil. Forced to once again defend her in court, Phoenix learns that Franziska von Karma, the daughter of his old enemy Manfred von Karma, has assumed the role of High Prosecutor from Miles Edgeworth, who is presumed dead. Teaming up with Maya and her young cousin Pearl, Phoenix uncovers a conspiracy between Mimi Miney, <b>a</b> <b>disgruntled</b> nurse who once worked at Grey's clinic, and Maya's aunt Morgan Fey to ruin Maya's chances of succeeding her mother as spiritual leader of her home village. When Miney publicly confesses to the murder, Morgan is sentenced to solitary confinement for her crimes and Phoenix decides to take Pearl in as one of his assistants. Six months later, the firm takes on another high-profile client: circus magician Maximillion Galactica, accused of murdering his employer Russell Berry in a dispute. Despite Franziska's interference, Phoenix and his team prove that Acro, one of Max's fellow performers, framed him after mistakenly killing Russell.|$|E
