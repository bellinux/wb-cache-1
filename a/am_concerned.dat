Some residents also complained that the proposed turnpike would mainly serve through traffic, despite OTA estimates that south Tulsa residents would make up 90% of the road's userbase.|$|E

The 1981 Canada Cup turned a profit of about C$1 million to be split between Hockey Canada and the National Hockey League Players Association pension fund, one third that of the 1976 tournament. Shortly after the tournament ended, Eagleson confirmed he intended to hold a third Canada Cup.

[...] Bill Pascrell, the member of the U.S. House of Representatives from New Jersey's 8th congressional district, asked the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the relationship between Ticketmaster and TicketsNow, saying, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> that the business affiliation between Ticketmaster and TicketsNow may represent {{a conflict of interest}} that is detrimental to the average fan.

500|$|Historically, a few {{municipalities}} had ordinances against underage drinking {{on private}} property, but {{a class action}} lawsuit in 1998 against the town of Avalon nullified these laws. [...] In 2000, the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill criminalizing underage consumption of alcoholic beverages on private property New Jersey Governor Christine Whitman pocket vetoed the bill over privacy concerns: [...] "While I completely support {{the intent of the}} bill, I <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> that the bill's prohibitions could be construed to apply to situations in which an underage person consumes even a small amount of alcohol {{under the watchful eye of}} an adult family member." [...] Later that year, Whitman signed a revised bill that allowed municipalities to pass ordinance prohibiting underage drinking on private property. Besides giving municipalities a choice on whether to implement such a policy, the revised bill imposed substantially lighter penalties on underage drinkers, and the new law made an exception for alcohol provided by any relative, not just a parent or guardian.|$|E
