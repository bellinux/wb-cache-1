Furthermore, the research was emphasized on the comparison of taste quality of mature and baby Ling chih, mycelia and filtrate and the analysis of constituents and structure of their hot-water-extracted polysaccharides. Finally, the research was focused on the physiological properties of water extracts and hot-water extracted polysaccharides from Ling chih, mycelia and filtrate, including antioxidant and antimutagenic properties and cytotoxicity on cancer cells. In polypropylene bag cultivation, Ling chih was preferably inoculated after March and harvested during May to November in Mid-Taiwan region. With regards to the biological efficiency in fruiting body cultivation, baby Ling chih was evidently higher than Ling chih (1. 05 > 0. 56). In shaken flask culture, the relationship of dry mycelial biomass and pH value, residual sugar content, laccase activity and polysaccharide concentration indicated that at day 12 the highest amount of dry biomass (18. 74 g/L) was obtained with the highest amount polysaccharide concentration (1. 38 g/L). The contents of taste components were found in descending order of filtrate, mycelia, baby Ling chih and Ling chih. With regard to the hot-water or hot alkali extraction, the yield was the highest for mycelial polysaccharides. However, the highest sugar content was found in hot-water extracted polysaccharides from filtrate. The protein contents of hot <b>alkali</b> <b>extracted</b> polysaccharides from Baby ling chih, mycelia and filtrate were higher than that of their hot-water extracted polysaccharides. The hot-water and hot <b>alkali</b> <b>extracted</b> polysaccharides comprised mainly of mannitol.

The profiles of infrared spectra were similar for hot-water extracted polysaccharides from four forms of G. tsugae. All of them exhibited the absorption characteristics of sugar functional groups whereas only that from filtrate showed the -glucosidal bonding. Cold-water extract from Ling chih showed the best antioxidant properties, especially the antioxidant activity, scavenging ability in free radicals and chelating ability on ferrous ions. Using the conjugated diene method, hot-water extracted polysaccharides from four forms of G. tsugae were good in antioxidant properties. With regard to reducing power, scavenging ability on 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radicals and chelating ability on ferrous ions, hot-water extracted polysaccharides from mature and baby Ling chih were superior over the hot <b>alkali</b> <b>extracted.</b> The hot <b>alkali</b> <b>extracted</b> polysaccharides from mycelia and filtrate were better than the hot-water extracted in reducing power, scavenging ability and chelating ability.

No toxicity or mutagenicity was found in Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 was observed at 0. 05 - 5 mg/plate of Ling chih, mycelia and filtrate from the submerged culture. The water extracts from Ling chih, mycelia and filtrate were good in antimutagenic effect against NQNO. The hot water extracts from baby Ling chih and mycelia showed the excellent effect against NQNO toward TA 98 and TA 100. The water extracts and hot extracted polysaccharide from G. tsugae showed excellent effect against B[a]P toward S. typhimurium TA 100. The cold water extracts and hot-alkali-extracted polysaccharide from baby Ling chih showed excellent effect against B[a]P. In the anti-tumor activity test, the inhibitory effects on IMR 32 and Hep G 2 tumor cell lines were studied using MTT test. At 10 mg/ml, hot-water extracts from Ling chih showed stronger cytotoxicity on IMR 32 cells, with a survival of 29. 03 ∼ 30. 93 %. Cold-water extracts and hot-water extracted polysaccharides from four forms of G. tsugae exhibited better cytotoxicity on MR 32 cellswith the increased concentrations. Only hot-water extracts from Ling chih showed the cytotoxic effect on Hep G 2 cells. The cytotoxicity of hot-water extracted polysaccharides on Hep G 2 cells were in the descending order of Ling chih > baby Ling chih > filtrate > mycelia. 本研究首先探討本土產松杉靈芝（Ganoderma tsugae Murrill）不同類型之生產方法，包括採用太空包栽培以生產成熟靈芝和靈芝茸及採用深層培養以得到靈芝菌絲體及發酵濾液；其次比較成熟靈芝、靈芝茸、菌絲體和發酵濾液之呈味品質及分析其熱萃多醣之組成份及結構；最後評估靈芝子實體、菌絲體及發酵濾液之水萃取物及熱萃多醣之生理機能性，包括抗氧化性質、抗致突變性及對癌細胞之毒殺效果。 針對松杉靈芝不同栽培法發現，太空包栽培法中，本省中部地區適合於 3 月後開始接種， 5 ∼ 11 月皆適合採收，而靈芝茸之生物效力明顯高於靈芝之生物效力（ 1. 05 > 0. 56 ）。在松杉靈芝之三角瓶振盪培養中，由菌絲體重與pH值、殘糖量、漆酶活性及多醣量之關係，顯示培養第 12 天可獲得最高之菌絲體乾重（ 18. 74 g/L）及最高之菌絲多醣量（ 1. 38 g/L）。四種不同栽培型式的靈芝產品所含呈味成份之量依序為發酵濾液>菌絲體>靈芝茸>靈芝。 以熱水或熱鹼萃取靈芝多醣發現，靈芝菌絲體多醣萃取率最高。然而，發酵濾液之熱萃多醣含有最高量的總糖。在蛋白質含量上，靈芝茸、菌絲體及發酵濾液之熱鹼萃多醣明顯高於其熱水萃多醣。由中性單醣組成分析來看，靈芝、靈芝茸、菌絲體及發酵濾液之熱水萃及熱鹼萃多醣主要由甘露醣醇所組成。以膠體層析法得知四種栽培型式的靈芝熱水萃多醣的分子量大小依序為靈芝茸>靈芝>菌絲體>發酵濾液，而其分子量範圍為 2. 8  104 ∼ 1. 8  105 Da。四種不同栽培類型靈芝之熱萃多醣的紅外線光譜大同小異，皆具有糖類官能基之吸光特性，唯發酵濾液熱萃多醣具有-糖苷鍵。 評估靈芝抗氧化性質部份，靈芝子實體冷水萃取物之抗氧化性質表現極佳，尤其具極佳之抗氧化力、清除羥自由基能力及螯合亞鐵離子能力。以共軛雙烯法測試，四種不同栽培型式靈芝熱萃多醣皆具有極佳的抗氧化能力。靈芝及靈芝茸之熱水萃多醣在還原力、清除 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 - picrylhydrazyl（DPPH）自由基能力較熱鹼萃多醣為佳，而菌絲體及發酵濾液之熱鹼萃多醣在還原力、清除DPPH自由基能力及螯合亞鐵離子能力上優於熱水萃多醣。而不管是熱水萃或熱鹼萃多醣，靈芝、靈芝茸、菌絲體及發酵濾液皆具有極佳的抗氧化性質。 在抗致突變部分，靈芝子實體、菌絲體及發酵濾液之水萃取物及熱萃多醣，在測試劑量範圍內（ 0. 05 〜 5 mg/plate），對於Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 及TA 100 菌株皆無毒性及致突變性。四種不同栽培類型靈芝水萃取物在S. typhimurium TA 98 及TA 100 菌株系統對NQNO具抗致突變性，其中以靈芝茸及菌絲體之熱水萃取物最具功效；而靈芝熱萃多醣亦對NQNO有抗致突變性，其中以靈芝茸熱鹼萃多醣效果最佳。靈芝水萃取物及熱萃多醣在S. typhimurium TA 100 對B[a]P具有極強大的抗突變效果，其中以靈芝冷水萃取物及熱鹼多醣效果最佳。 在癌細胞毒性試驗，以MTT分析法觀察靈芝對IMR 32 及Hep G 2 癌細胞生長之影響。在濃度 10 mg/ml時，靈芝子實體熱水萃取物對IMR 32 癌細胞具有較強之毒殺作用，癌細胞存活率僅餘 29. 03 ∼ 30. 93 %。四種不同栽培類型靈芝之冷水萃取物及熱萃多醣隨著濃度的增加，對IMR 32 癌細胞毒殺作用亦增加。以靈芝水萃取物對Hep G 2 癌細胞毒殺能力而言，子實體熱水萃取物較具效果。而靈芝熱萃多醣對Hep G 2 癌細胞毒殺能力依序為成熟靈芝>靈芝茸>發酵濾液>菌絲體，其中以靈芝子實體熱水萃多醣毒殺效果最佳。表次 x 圖次 xvii 第一章 文獻整理 1 壹、前言 2 貳、文獻整理 5 參、本論文之研究架構 32 第二章 松杉靈芝栽培與深層培養及其呈味品質之評估 33 壹、前言 34 貳、材料與方法 35 參、結果與討論 46 一、松杉靈芝之太空包栽培 46 二、松杉靈芝之深層培養 49 三、松杉靈芝子實體、菌絲體及發酵濾液之品質評估 54 （一）一般成分分析 54 （二）可溶性糖類之組成 56 （三）游離胺基酸之組成分析 58 （四）核苷酸之組成分析 62 肆、結論 65 第三章 不同栽培類型松杉靈芝熱水萃及熱鹼萃多醣理化性質分析 66 壹、前言 67 貳、材料與方法 68 參、研究架構 74 肆、結果與討論 75 一、靈芝子實體、菌絲體及發酵濾液熱萃多醣萃取率之比較 75 二、靈芝子實體、菌絲體及發酵濾液熱萃多醣組成份分析 75 （一）靈芝熱萃多醣之成分分析 75 （二）靈芝熱萃多醣之元素分析 79 （三）靈芝熱萃多醣之中性單糖組成分分析 80 三、靈芝子實體、菌絲體及發酵濾液熱萃多醣分子量測定及光譜 分析 86 （一）靈芝熱萃多醣分子量之測定 86 （二）靈芝熱萃多醣多醣之光譜分析 90 1.

40|$|Partially {{purified}} polysaccharides (FP) and hot <b>alkali</b> <b>extract</b> (FNa) {{obtained from}} fruiting {{bodies of the}} wild basidiomycete Grifola frondosa were examined for their antimicrobial, antioxidant and cytotoxic activity. The structural properties of FP and FNa samples were investigated by FT-IR and high resolution 1 H- and 13 C-NMR spectroscopy. From a group of various G - and G + bacteria the antibacterial effects were highest against the G + B. cereus. FNa was the better antioxidant shown by the lower EC 50 values of DPPH scavenging ability, ferric-reducing antioxidant power and ferrous ion-chelating ability. Ferric-reducing antioxidant power and ferrous ion-chelating ability were mostly linked to total polysaccharides, total- and ß-glucan content, as well as total protein content. Both extracts displayed a moderate dose dependent antiproliferative action towards malignant human breast cancer MDA-MB- 453, cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa and myelogenous leukemia K 562 cells not observed in the non cancer derived MRC- 5 fibroblasts. The highest effect was found in HeLa cells for FP extract.

40|$|Phosphorus {{in organic}} {{combinations}} makes {{up as much}} as half or more of the total phosphorus found ill the surface layers of Iowa soils, and hence might be expected to furnish a significant proportion of the phosphorus used by crops. Since little was known about the relative amounts of different organic phosphorus compounds present, the conditions under which these compounds are stabilized in the soil, and the mineralization of soil organic phosphorus compounds, these problems formed the subject of the present investigations. It was found that phytin and its derivatives, {{with the exception of the}} monophosphate, can be separated from nucleic acid by their precipitation as calcium salts under alkaline conditions. The organic phosphorus in <b>alkali</b> <b>extracts</b> of soils is separated into two fractions by this procedure. A major part of the soil organic phosphorus behaved like phytin in that it was precipitated by calcium, and the remainder behaved like nucleic acid in that it remained soluble. Dephosphorylation tests with alkaline sodium hypobromite and with enzymes from corn roots and wheat bran showed that the soil fractions behaved like phytin and nucleic acid, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Antitumor {{fraction}} was purified from dilute <b>alkali</b> <b>extract</b> {{of leaves}} of bamboo-grass, Sasa Kurilensis. Conditions were first investigated to obtain reliable {{data of the}} effect. Particularly transplantation of suspension of tumor cells diminished the fluctuation of weight of tumors. 10 ^ 6 / 0. 2 ml of cell population was necessary for sufficient growth of tumor {{on the occasion of}} subcutaneous transplantation. This antitumor fraction contains 71 % of lignin. Other components in the preparation, such as 25 % of peptides and 3 % of sugar which exist combined with lignin do not participate in the activity. It shows no toxicity by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal administration. The fraction was proved to have antitumor activity against NF-sarcoma and sarcoma 180 by the administration of 12 mg per head seven times every other day. In these cases the fraction was administered subcutaneously to the affected part. The activity of liver-catalase of tumor-bearing mice was remarkably recovered by administration of bamboo-grass lignin. 1) 笹葉から抗腫瘍分画を抽出し,この製剤のNF sarcoma,およびsarcoma 180 に対する制癌作用を検討した. 腫瘍重量の変異を少なくするために種々の条件を検討し,特に腫瘍細胞をけん濁液として移植することによつて目的を達した. 2) この製剤を 1 頭宛 12 mg, 6 ～ 7 回腫瘍生長部に注入すればNF sarcoma, sarcoma 180 に対して抑制作用をもつていることが知られた. さらに赤外吸収スペクトル,ニトロベンゼン酸化,硫酸処理などによつて,この製剤が 71 %のリグニンを含有することが明らかになつた. この製剤中には 3 %のリグニンに結合した糖類,および 25 %のリグニンと強い親和性をもつた蛋白質あるいはペプチドが含まれるがこれらのものは直接にはこの製剤の制癌作用には影響しないと考えられる. この製剤を投与した担癌マウスの肝カタラーが著しく上昇して正常マウスのそれに近づく. 3) 赤松のクラフト蒸解によつて得られたリグニンにも抑制作用が認められたがその効果は弱かつた...|$|R
40|$|An alkali-soluble {{extract from}} a cell wall {{preparation}} of Candida albicans was conjugated to sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) by using periodate oxidation or concanavalin A. Conjugated SRBC readily {{attached to a}} fibrin-platelet matrix, whereas nonconjugated SRBC did not. To determine the active component which promoted attachment of SRBC, the alkali-soluble fraction was treated with alpha-mannosidase, pronase, or glusulase or chemically degraded by acetolysis. The treated extract was then reconjugated with SRBC, and attachment was measured. When treated with alpha-mannosidase or degraded by acetolysis, the alkali-soluble extract failed to promote the adherence of SRBC to the fibrin-platelet matrix. Pronase- or glusulase-digested extract promoted attachment equally as well as untreated controls. In addition, when preabsorbed with antiserum to whole cells of C. albicans, the <b>alkali</b> <b>extract</b> abrogated the inhibition of adherence by antiserum, thus indicating its antigenicity. The extract consisted primarily of polysaccharide (72 %) and contained {{a small amount of}} protein (less than 1 %). Mannose and glucose (ratio, 3 : 1) were detected by gas-liquid chromatography. These data indicate that cell surface mannan may {{play an important role in}} the adherence of C. albicans to the fibrin-platelet matrices which form in vivo on the endocardium of heart valves...|$|R
40|$|The {{skin of the}} halibut (Reinhararditus hippoglossoides) {{has long}} been {{discarded}} as a waste product by the food industry in large quantities; hence, we examined the biological activity in the skin for utilization of the waste. In the present study, we determined induction of hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 γ (HNF 3 γ), which is involved in liver function, using human hepatoma cell line HepG 2 and extracellular matrix components extracted from the fish skin. Induction of the HNF 3 γ was detected by reporter plasmid constructed with the promoter region of the HNF 3 γ gene and luciferase or green fluorescent protein genes. The <b>alkali</b> <b>extract</b> containing proteoglycan showed HNF 3 γ induction, but the acid-extract enriched in collagen did not. Consequently, dermatan sulfate showed the strongest activity in HNF 3 γ induction. These observations suggested that fish skin has some significant biological activity, and indicates its possible function in {{the food and drug}} industry.

40|$|To {{prepare and}} explore the {{structure}} of native hemicellulose from tomato, extraction of the natively acetylated polysaccharides was achieved from partially depectinated cell walls by DMSO doped with LiCl. DEAE anion exchange chromatography of the LiCl-DMSO extract allowed the removal of residual acidic pectin and the isolation of acetylated glucuronoxylan. The hemicellulose neutral fraction from the anion exchanger was fractionnated by size exclusion chromatography into xyloglucan (XyG) and galactoglucomannan (GgM) either as single major constituents or as mixtures of both. Residual hemicellulose in the cell wall was extracted by 4. 0 M and not 1. 0 M KOH. The fine structure of all LiCl-DMSO fractions and <b>alkali</b> <b>extracts</b> was assessed by coupling β-glucanase, β-mannanase and β-xylanase enzymatic degradations {{to the analysis of}} the resulting fragments by HPAEC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. This approach revealed substitutions in part of the GgM fractions by pentose residues, presumably arabinose and/or xylose occuring in highly substituted block domains. It also demonstrated a different glucanase hydrolysis profile from 4. 0 M KOH compared to LiCl-DMSO soluble fractions. The present extraction and purification scheme allow the recovery of several populations of acetylated hemicellulose families which emphasize the structural diversity and complexity of these polysaccharides...|$|R

Recent studies indicated that P. betulinus was probably used as a religious and medicinal item. In order to examine the medicinal potential of P. betulinus, hot water (HW), partially purified (PP), and <b>alkali</b> <b>extract</b> (HA) were prepared and tested for antioxidant, antimicrobial, cytotoxic, and angiotensin I–converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. All tested samples exhibited moderate cytotoxic activity, and HW appeared as the most effective (IC 50 = 0. 8 ± 0. 1 mg/ml for HeLa cells). HA proved to be a good 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenger and exhibited the strongest ferric-reducing power (EC 50 = 0. 07 ± 0. 3 mg/ml). The same extract (HA) also expressed the strongest ferric-reducing power (EC 50 = 0. 99 ± 0. 1 mg/ml). Hot alkali extraction contributed significantly to ACE inhibitory activity (EC 50 = 0. 06 ± 0. 00 mg/ml) and to antimicrobial activity, especially against highly resistant Enterococcus faecalis (minimum inhibitory concentration: 0. 156 ± 0. 000 mg/ml; and minimum bactericidal concentration: 1. 25 ± 0. 00 mg/ml). </p...|$|R
