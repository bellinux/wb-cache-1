5|$|The {{project was}} also charged with {{gathering}} intelligence on the German nuclear weapon project. Through Operation Alsos, Manhattan Project personnel served in Europe, sometimes behind enemy lines, where they gathered nuclear materials and documents, <b>and</b> <b>rounded</b> up German scientists. Despite the Manhattan Project's tight security, Soviet atomic spies successfully penetrated the program.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Charles Horton Peck {{described}} the variety magna from material collected in North Elba, New York. Peck {{explained that the}} variety differed from the typical species in several ways: var. magna grew among fallen leaves under balsam fir trees, or among mosses on the ground, not on buried wood; it lacked a stem, and was instead broad <b>and</b> <b>rounded</b> underneath; its hymenium was more yellow-brown then the nominate variety; and, its spore were slightly longer.|$|E

5|$|Sheriff Porttens {{was outraged}} {{that the police}} fled <b>and</b> <b>rounded</b> up the {{officers}} who were missing and ordered them to protect the streetcars, but thirty-three resigned rather than follow the order. Mayor Shank supported the police mutiny and their refusal to protect the streetcars. He insisted that the situation required Governor Ralston to take action. Without police protection, the Traction and Terminal Company shut down operations and refused to restart them until adequate protection could be provided.|$|E
5|$|The Charolais breed was small, {{and most}} closely {{physically}} resembled the Morvan horse, another now-extinct French type. The breed {{had a short}} head with small ears and a short, strong neck attached low on the shoulder. The body was short <b>and</b> <b>rounded,</b> with a broad croup and strong legs. They were {{generally considered to be}} small and inelegant. They were strong, robust and hardy, the last of these traits especially so before the breeding changes of the 19th century, and were known for their pulling power.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Otarioidea and Phocoidea diverged 33mya. The Phocidae {{are likely to have}} descended from the extinct family Desmatophocidae in the North Atlantic. Desmatophocids lived 23–10 mya and had elongated skulls, fairly large eyes, cheekbones connected by a mortised structure <b>and</b> <b>rounded</b> cheek teeth. They also were sexually dimorphic and may have been capable of propelling themselves with both the foreflippers and hindflippers.|$|E

5|$|The {{head of an}} American Cocker Spaniel {{makes the}} breed {{immediately}} recognizable, with the rounded dome of the skull, well-pronounced stop, and a square shaped lip. The drop ears are long, low set, with long silky fur, and the eyes are dark, large, <b>and</b> <b>rounded.</b> The nose can be black or brown depending on the colour of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Vowel {{letters are}} also grouped in pairs—of unrounded <b>and</b> <b>rounded</b> vowel sounds—with these pairs also {{arranged}} from front {{on the left}} to back on the right, and from maximal closure at top to minimal closure at bottom.

5|$|Giant otter muzzles {{are short}} and sloping {{and give the}} head a ball-shaped appearance. The ears are small <b>and</b> <b>rounded.</b> The nose (or rhinarium) is {{completely}} covered in fur, with only the two slit-like nostrils visible. The giant otter's highly sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) allow the animal to track changes in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey. The legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. Well suited for an aquatic life, it can close its ears and nose while underwater.|$|E

5|$|Normal time {{ended with}} the game at 2–2. The ensuing periods of extra time saw {{defensive}} football from both sides; Celtic was down to ten men when Bobo Balde was dismissed on 95 minutes after his second yellow card. On 112 minutes, Derlei reacted quickest to a Robert Douglas block <b>and</b> <b>rounded</b> McNamara make it 3–2 for Porto. Porto managed to hang on even after having Nuno Valente sent off just {{before the end of}} extra-time, thus ensuring that Porto had ended their 16-year wait between European trophies. It was Porto's first UEFA Cup win, and they were also the first team to win a trophy on the silver goal rule.|$|E
5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark has an elongated body, {{over half of}} which is comprised by the slender caudal peduncle. The snout is short <b>and</b> <b>rounded,</b> with the nares placed almost at the tip along {{with a pair of}} tiny barbels; there are grooves running from the nares to the mouth. There are 2635 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2132 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The teeth are small, with broad bases and triangular cusps. The eyes are oval in shape and elevated, with a large spiracle below each. The five pairs of gill slits are small, with the fourth and fifth very close together.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{slightly}} smaller and shorter-based than the second, and neither has spines. The first dorsal fin originates behind the free rear {{tip of the}} pectoral fins, while the second originates above {{the middle of the}} pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are short <b>and</b> <b>rounded.</b> The caudal fin has a prominent upper lobe with a well-developed notch near the tip, and a barely present lower lobe. The form and arrangement of the fins is similar to the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), from which this species can be distinguished by the lack of fin spines. The dermal denticles are small and flat, with a single horizontal ridge ending in a point.|$|E

5|$|The giant {{freshwater}} stingray has a thin, oval {{pectoral fin}} disc slightly longer than wide and broadest towards the front. The elongated snout {{has a wide}} base and a sharply pointed tip that projects beyond the disc. The eyes are minute and widely spaced; behind them are large spiracles. Between the nostrils is a short curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin. The small mouth forms a gentle arch and contains four to seven papillae (two to four large at the center and one to four small to the sides) on the floor. The small <b>and</b> <b>rounded</b> teeth are arranged into pavement-like bands. There are five pairs of gill slits on the ventral side of the disc. The pelvic fins are small and thin; mature males have relatively large claspers.|$|E
5|$|The {{head has}} {{a less than}} {{triangular}} shape with a blunt <b>and</b> <b>rounded</b> snout. Still, the head is much wider than the neck. The rostral scale is small. The circumorbital ring consists of 10–16 scales. Across {{the top of the}} head, there are 7–11 interocular scales. 3–4 scales separate the suboculars and the supralabials. There are 12–17 supralabials and 13–17 sublabials. The first 3–4 sublabials contact the chin shields, of which there is only one pair. Often, there are two fangs on each maxilla and both can be functional.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is small}} and streamlined, adding to the agility of the cheetah. Saharan cheetah have narrow canine faces. Small, short, <b>and</b> <b>rounded,</b> the ears are marked by black patches on the back; the edges and base of the ears are tawny. The high-set eyes have round pupils. The whiskers, shorter and fewer in number than those of other felids, are fine and inconspicuous. The {{pronounced}} tear streaks are unique to the cheetah. These streaks originate {{from the corner of}} the eyes and run down the nose to the mouth. Their role is obscurethey may be serving as a shield for the eyes against the sun's glare, a helpful feature as the cheetah hunts mainly during the day; another purpose could be to define facial expressions.|$|E

5|$|The {{pectoral}} and pelvic fins are broad <b>and</b> <b>rounded</b> and are thickly muscled. The two similarly-sized dorsal fins {{are placed}} well {{back on the}} body. The anal fin is low and positioned {{just in front of}} the caudal fin. The caudal fin has only an upper lobe, which contains a prominent ventral notch near the tip and is angled almost horizontally relative to the body. Adult epaulette sharks are beige to brownish above with many widely spaced brown spots and subtle darker bands. There is a very large black spot ringed in white located behind each pectoral fin; this pair of spots are the origin of this shark's common name. Juveniles have alternating light and dark bands over their body and fins, which break up as they mature. Epaulette sharks are typically 7090cm (2735 in) long; the maximum reported length is 107cm (42in).|$|E
5|$|The pigeye shark {{is a very}} robust-bodied {{species with}} a short, broad, <b>and</b> <b>rounded</b> snout. The small and {{circular}} eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes. The anterior rims of the nostrils bear medium-sized flaps of skin. The mouth forms a wide arch and has barely noticeable furrows at the corners. There are 11–13 (usually 12) upper and 10–12 (usually 11) lower tooth rows on each side; in addition, there are single rows of tiny teeth at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are broad and triangular with serrated edges; those in the lower jaw are slightly narrower, more upright, and more finely serrated than those in the upper. The five pairs of gill slits are of moderate length.|$|E
5|$|While in port, Spee {{received}} the {{order from the}} Admiralty Staff to attempt to break through to Germany. The ships remained in the port for only 24 hours, {{in accordance with the}} neutrality restrictions, and arrived at Mas a Fuera on 6 November, where they took on more coal from captured British and French steamers. Dresden and Leipzig took their turn in Valparaiso, after which the re-formed squadron continued south <b>and</b> <b>rounded</b> Cape Horn into the South Atlantic. In the meantime, the Royal Navy sent a pair of battlecruisers— and —commanded by Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee to hunt down Spee's squadron and avenge Cradock's defeat.|$|E
