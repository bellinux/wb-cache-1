But {{the backlash}} against the New Deal, coupled with continuing congressional concern over the Act's suspension of <b>antitrust</b> <b>law,</b> left the President's request politically dead. By May 1935, the issue was moot as the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled Title I of NIRA unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|Historian Lowell H. Harrison called Stanley's {{administration}} {{the apex}} of the Progressive Era in Kentucky. The most significant legislation passed during the 1916 legislative session were a state <b>antitrust</b> <b>law</b> and a ban on railroads offering free passes to public figures. A Corrupt Practices Act required candidates for office to file reports of their expenses, limited the amount of allowable expenses, and forbade public service corporations from contributing to any campaign. Other accomplishments included initiating the state's first budget program, enacting its first workman's compensation law, and instituting a convict labor law. The one progressive measure that did not pass, a bill granting women's suffrage, failed in the House by a single vote.|$|E

Part III addresses the inability of the Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate the market for corporate control via the Williams Act in that there is no inherent conflict between the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s disclosure requirements and the policy of <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws.</b> Part IV analyzes the quantitative economic effects of the diminution of competition in the market for corporate control and examine its aggregate effect on shareholders...|$|R

2500|$|The Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, {{state governments}} and private parties who are {{sufficiently}} affected may all bring {{actions in the}} courts to enforce the <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws.</b> The scope of <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws,</b> {{and the degree to}} which they should interfere in an enterprise's freedom to conduct business, or to protect smaller businesses, communities and consumers, are strongly debated. One view, mostly closely associated with the [...] "Chicago School of economics" [...] suggests that <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws</b> should focus solely on the benefits to consumers and overall efficiency, while a broad range of legal and economic theory sees the role of <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws</b> as also controlling economic power in the public interest.|$|R
5|$|In the June 2009 {{legislative}} elections, Kirchner {{was defeated}} by Francisco de Narváez of the Union PRO coalition for National Deputy of Buenos Aires Province. The Front for Victory was defeated in the Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and Córdoba, and the Kirchners lost the Congressional majority. Voter disenchantment with the Kirchners was caused by inflation, crime and the previous year's agricultural conflict, which cost them rural support. The Kirchners pushed a media law through during the Congress' lame-duck session. The Kirchners described it as an <b>antitrust</b> <b>law</b> to limit media ownership, but critics considered instead that {{it was used to}} reduce the freedom of the press.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{not invited}} to {{participate}} in the presidential debates because he did not meet the criteria of 15% support in five polls set by the Commission on Presidential Debates. In 2015, Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein filed a lawsuit against the commission, arguing that the commission and its rules violated <b>antitrust</b> <b>law</b> and the First Amendment. In August 2016, the lawsuit was dismissed. Johnson's poll numbers have been averaging between 7 and 9 percent. Johnson's campaign manager Ron Nielson argued for Johnson's inclusion, citing Ross Perot's admission to the debates in the 1992 debates, when Perot was polling at 8 percent.|$|E
5|$|During an {{unsuccessful}} senatorial bid in 1914, Stanley assumed an anti-prohibition stance. This issue would dominate {{his political career}} {{for more than a}} decade and put him at odds with J. C. W. Beckham, the leader of the pro-temperance faction of the state's Democratic Party. In 1915, Stanley ran for governor, defeating his close friend Edwin P. Morrow by just over 400 votes. It was the closest gubernatorial race in the state's history. Historian Lowell H. Harrison called Stanley's administration the apex of the Progressive Era in Kentucky. Among the reforms adopted during his tenure were a state <b>antitrust</b> <b>law,</b> a campaign finance reform law, and a workman's compensation law. In 1918, Stanley was chosen as the Democratic nominee to succeed the recently deceased senator Ollie M. James. Stanley was elected, but did not resign as governor to take the seat until May 1919 and accomplished little in his single term. He lost his re-election bid to Frederic M. Sackett in the 1924 Republican landslide and never again held elected office. He died in Washington, D.C. on August 12, 1958.|$|E

50|$|As in {{the typical}} {{pre-emption}} case, the inquiry is whether there exists an irreconcilable conflict between {{the federal and state}} regulatory schemes. The existence of a hypothetical or potential conflict is insufficient to warrant the pre-emption of the state statute. A state regulatory scheme is not pre-empted by the federal <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws</b> simply be-cause in a hypothetical situation a private party's compliance with the statute might cause him to violate the <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws.</b> A state statute is not pre-empted by the federal <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws</b> simply be-cause the state scheme might have an anti-competitive effect.|$|R

5|$|In December 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice blocked Gannett {{from using}} an {{agreement}} with Sander Media to operate CBS affiliate KMOV in St. Louis alongside its own NBC station KSDK, and ordered Gannett to sell KMOV. Even though Gannett planned to operate KMOV separately from KSDK, the Department ruled the agreement to {{be a violation of}} <b>antitrust</b> <b>law,</b> as it would reduce competition for advertising sales. Following the closure of the Belo purchase, Meredith Corporation announced a deal to purchase KMOV, along with KTVK and KASW. As Meredith would have a duopoly between KTVK and its Phoenix CBS affiliate KPHO-TV, KASW was to be sold to SagamoreHill Broadcasting and operated by Meredith under an LMA. As a result of the FCC's scrutiny on any new station sharing agreements, on October 23, 2014, Meredith would backtrack on this plan and instead sell KASW to the Nexstar Broadcasting Group, which would operate the station independently of KTVK and KPHO.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill had}} a more {{difficult}} time in the Senate. The National Association of Manufacturers, Chamber of Commerce, and industrialist Henry Ford all opposed its passage. Senator Bennett Champ Clark introduced an amendment to emasculate Section 7(a), but Wagner and Senator George W. Norris led the successful opposition to the change. The bulk of the Senate debate, however, turned on the bill's suspension of <b>antitrust</b> <b>law.</b> Senators William E. Borah, Burton K. Wheeler, and Hugo Black opposed any relaxation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, arguing that this would exacerbate existing severe economic inequality and concentrate wealth {{in the hands of}} the rich (a severe problem which many economists at the time believed was one of the causes of the Great Depression). Wagner defended the bill, arguing that the bill's promotion of codes of fair trade practices would help create progressive standards for wages, hours, and working conditions, and eliminate sweatshops and child labor. The Senate passed the amended legislation 57-to-24 on June 9.|$|E
25|$|Another form of {{economic}} regulation, <b>antitrust</b> <b>law,</b> seeks to strengthen market forces so that direct regulation is unnecessary.

40|$|The most {{striking}} aspect of international antitrust {{during the last}} several years has been the extraordinary proliferation of new statutes and strengthened enforcement of competition laws throughout the world. Today the great majority of industrialized and emergent economy countries have antitrust legislation both on the books and in actual practice.

Latin American countries have also recently enacted or strengthened their <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws</b> and enforcement. Similarly, antitrust has mushroomed in the Pacific countries, where Japan has gradually been increasing its enforcement and several other countries have recently enacted or strengthened their <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws,</b> notably Korea and Taiwan.
