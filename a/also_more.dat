5|$|Although no {{distinguishing}} structural features {{have been}} found to separate the workers and queens, the male is easily identified by its bulging eyes, subquadrate clypeus, and slender antennae. P. exclamans males are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> variable in external morphology compared to females. This is possible given the male’s hemizygosity (females are homozygous).|$|E

5|$|Horses in the Middle Ages {{differed}} in size, build and breed from the modern horse, and were, on average, smaller. They were <b>also</b> <b>more</b> central to society than their modern counterparts, being essential for war, agriculture, and transport.|$|E
5|$|Oats are {{the most}} popular grain for horses. Oats have a lower {{digestible}} energy value and higher fiber content than most other grains. They form a loose mass in the stomach that is well suited to the equine digestive system. They are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> palatable and digestible than other grains.|$|E

5|$|The main {{geological}} outcrops {{around the}} lake are mudstone, largely consisting of red siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of sandstone from the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> recent alluvial deposits beside {{the course of the}} River Chew.|$|E
5|$|The neo-noir film genre {{developed}} mid-way {{into the}} Cold War. This cinematological trend reflected {{much of the}} cynicism {{and the possibility of}} nuclear annihilation of the era. This new genre introduced innovations that were not available with the earlier noir films. The violence was <b>also</b> <b>more</b> potent than in earlier noir films.|$|E
5|$|A last {{group of}} sheep breeds {{is that of}} fur or hair sheep, which do not grow wool at all. Hair sheep {{are similar to the}} early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the Dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing. Hair sheep are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> {{resistant}} to parasites and hot weather.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{acquired}} conditions augment {{the risk of}} thrombosis. A prominent example is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is caused by antibodies against constituents of the cell membrane, particularly lupus anticoagulant (first found in people with the disease systemic lupus erythematosus but often detected in people without the disease), anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies; it is therefore regarded as an autoimmune disease. In some cases antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial as well as venous thrombosis. It is <b>also</b> <b>more</b> strongly associated with miscarriage, and can cause {{a number of other}} symptoms (such as livedo reticularis of the skin and migraine).|$|E
5|$|After {{the flight}} test {{demonstration}} and {{validation of the}} prototypes, on 23 April 1991, Secretary of the USAF Donald Rice announced the YF-22 as {{the winner of the}} ATF competition. The YF-23 design was considered stealthier and faster, while the YF-22 was more maneuverable. The aviation press speculated that the YF-22 was <b>also</b> <b>more</b> adaptable to the U.S. Navy's Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), but by 1992, the Navy had abandoned NATF.|$|E
5|$|All {{living things}} on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid {{water as a}} solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane. Water is a {{stronger}} solvent than methane. Water is <b>also</b> <b>more</b> chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.|$|E

5|$|Although Tyler's {{family was}} dear to him, during his {{political}} rise {{he was often}} {{away from home for}} extended periods. When Tyler chose not to seek re-election to the House of Representatives in 1821 because of illness, he nevertheless expressed concern as he anticipated the proper education his growing family. While in office it was difficult to practice law being away in Washington part of the year, and his plantation was <b>also</b> <b>more</b> profitable when Tyler was available to manage it himself. By the time he entered the Senate in 1827, he had resigned himself to spending part of the year away from his family. Still, he sought to remain close to his children through letters.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not a true}} coral, Millepora alcicornis {{is subject}} to the same general threats that corals and coral reefs are facing. The {{greatest}} of these is global warming and the consequent rise in sea temperatures. Millepora alcicornis {{is one of the first}} corals to show bleaching as the symbiont zooxanthellae are killed. However, it is <b>also</b> <b>more</b> resilient than most and becomes re-established by recruitment earlier than the scleractinian corals. Other general threats to reefs include ocean acidification, pollution, sedimentation, invasive species and other changes in species dynamics, coral diseases, fisheries, leisure activities and tourism. Small quantities of Millepora alcicornis are gathered for sale to collectors.|$|E
5|$|Asteroseismic {{analysis}} of the star reveals it is approximately 10% more massive than the Sun and significantly older, at around 6.34 billion years. The radius of the star is 36% {{greater than that of}} the Sun and it is 90% more luminous. The star contains twice the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen of the Sun and is therefore described as metal-rich. Mu Arae is <b>also</b> <b>more</b> enriched than the Sun in the element helium.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} it was not {{mandatory}} to flight test new variants of existing engines, and certification testing failed to reveal vibration modes that the fan experienced during the regularly performed power climbs at high altitude. Analysis revealed that the fan was being subjected to high-cycle fatigue stresses worse than expected and <b>also</b> <b>more</b> severe than tested for certification; these higher stresses caused the blade to fracture. Less than a month after grounding, the fleet was allowed to resume operations once the fan blades and fan disc were replaced and the electronic engine controls were modified to reduce maximum engine thrust to 22,000lbf (98kN) from 23,500lbf (105kN). The redesigned fan blades were installed on all CFM56-3C1 and CFM56-3B2 engines, including over 1,800 engines that had already been delivered to customers.|$|E
5|$|Banded sugar ants are the {{dominant}} group of nocturnal ants in their range. Workers are mostly encountered at dusk when they are foraging for food on marked trails or on Casuarina and Eucalyptus trees. These ants also forage during the day, but they are more frequently seen at night. They are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> active during the warmer seasons, especially summer. Banded sugar ants use multiple social techniques to make other ants follow them to a food source; this includes a worker carrying another worker, tandem running, or simply leaving a pheromone trail to the source. Around 2–35% of foraging workers engage in tandem running.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{disorders}} occur {{more often}} in people with epilepsy, depending partly on the epilepsy syndrome present. These include depression, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and migraine. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder affects {{three to five times}} more children with epilepsy than children without the condition. ADHD and epilepsy have significant consequences on a child's behavioral, learning, and social development. Epilepsy is <b>also</b> <b>more</b> common in children with autism.|$|E
