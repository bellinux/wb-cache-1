50|$|Working {{from home}} {{is often cited}} as an {{attractive}} feature of freelancing, yet research suggests working from home introduces new sets of constraints for {{the process of doing}} work, particularly for married women with families, who continue to bear the brunt of household chores and child care despite increases in their paid work time. For instance, three years of ethnographic research about teleworkers in Australia conducted by Melissa Gregg, a Principal Engineer and Researcher in Residence for the Intel Science and Technology Center for Social Computing at UC Irvine, raises concerns over how both physical isolation and continuous <b>access</b> <b>enabled</b> with networked digital media puts pressure on homeworkers to demonstrate their commitments through continual responses by email and to conceal their family or home life.|$|E
50|$|On June 21, 2004 Apple {{announced}} Apple Remote Desktop 2 (released in July), {{which was}} designed to use the VNC protocol instead of Apple's original ARD protocol. This allows the ARD administration software to observe and control any computer running VNC-compatible server software (such as Windows and Unix systems) not just Macs and conversely allowing standard VNC viewing software to connect to any Mac with the ARD 2 software installed and VNC <b>access</b> <b>enabled.</b> This version also uses the TCP protocol for most functions (on ports 5900 and 5988), which is designed to be more reliable than the UDP protocol used in ARD 1. Port 3283 may also use UDP protocol. Another significant addition to ARD 2 was the Task List, that allows remote tasks to be queued and monitored, reporting their status (such as Succeeded or Failed). This release also dropped support for older versions of the Mac OS, requiring 10.2.8 or higher.|$|E

It had been called [...] "a revolutionizing concept". Critics said that the target group prefer online media to print because it is faster and even more adaptable to individual needs.In 2011 niiu had been converted for mobile devices due to organizational complexities in 2011.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we present C 2 Cfs- a {{decentralized}} collective caching architecture for distributed filesystems. C 2 Cfs diverges {{from the traditional}} client-server model and advocates decoupling the consistency management role of the central server from the data serving role. Our design enables multiple clientside caches to share data and efficiently propagate updates via direct client-to-client transfers, while maintaining the standard consistency semantics. We present an NFSv 4 -based implementation of our architecture, which works with unmodified NFS servers and requires no changes to the protocol. Finally, we evaluate the implementation and demonstrate the performance benefits of decentralized data <b>access</b> <b>enabled</b> by our approach. I...|$|E

Small office/home office business users can have immediate benefits by utilizing a consumer unit, typically with local <b>access</b> <b>enabled</b> to connect to local LAN servers. Medium and large enterprises need a different solution as multiple units need to cooperate to provide the necessary coverage and capacity.

40|$|The {{communication}} infrastructure between energy generation, transmission, distribution and utilization will require multi-way communications, interoperability between the advanced and existing system, and end-to-end reliable and secure communications with low-latencies. Revolutionary communication architecture {{is required for}} effective operation and control of smart grid, and cognitive radio based communication architecture can provide a unique solution. By leveraging cognitive radio technology, the suggested communications infrastructure promises to utilize potentially all available spectrum resources efficiently in the smart grid. The radio agility allows the smart grid devices to sense the unused spectrum opportunities in the surroundings and utilize them subject to interference constraints. Dynamic spectrum <b>access</b> <b>enabled</b> by cognitive radio technology can be adopted by the smart grid to exploit the underutilized frequencies in an opportunistic manner. As a result, the flexibility, efficiency, and reliability can be significantly enhanced in a cognitive radio based smart grid networ...|$|E
40|$|Young {{children}} {{from around the}} world are accessing the internet in ever increasing numbers. The rapid increase in internet activity by children aged 4 – 5 years in particular is due to the ease <b>access</b> <b>enabled</b> them by touchscreen internet-enabled tablet technologies. With young children now online, often independently of adult supervision, the need for early childhood cyber-safety education is becoming urgent. In this paper, we report the early findings from a project aimed at examining the development of cybersafety education for young children. We argue that cyber-safety education for young children cannot be effectively developed without first considering young children’s thinking about the internet. In this paper, we use Vygotsky’s ideas about the development of mature concepts from the merging of everyday and scientific concepts. We identify the potential range of everyday concepts likely to form the basis of young children’s thinking about the internet as a platform for cyber-safety education in the early years...|$|E
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of biological databases and the easy <b>access</b> <b>enabled</b> by the Internet {{is having a}} beneficial impact on biological sciences and transforming the way research is conducted. There are ~ 1100 molecular biology databases dispersed throughout the Internet. To assist in the functional, structural and evolutionary analysis of the abundant number of novel proteins continually identified from whole-genome sequencing, we introduce the PROFESS (PROtein Function, Evolution, Structure and Sequence) database. Our database {{is designed to be}} versatile and expandable and will not confine analysis to a pre-existing set of data relationships. A fundamental component of this approach is the development of an intuitive query system that incorporates a variety of similarity functions capable of generating data relationships not conceived during the creation of the database. The utility of PROFESS is demonstrated by the analysis of the structural drift of homologous proteins and the identification of potential pancreatic cancer therapeutic targets based on the observation of protein–protein interaction networks...|$|E
