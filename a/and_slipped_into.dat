5|$|BuzzSaw is themed {{around a}} series of unexplainable occurrences in the Town of Gold Rush which {{date back to the}} late 1800s. In 1876, the Town of Gold Rush was formed. It was a prosperous town during the great gold rush. Eleven years later, in 1887, the town's Gold supply was {{completely}} gone. The town then established a sawmill and turned their focus to timber. On a clear moon-lit night, a sawmill worker named Jack Darke was killed by the buzz saw after he had a scuffle with some other workers who were attempting to set the building on fire. The circumstances leading up to his death were covered up by the town with the legend stating that Jack tried to burn down the sawmill <b>and</b> <b>slipped</b> <b>into</b> the path of the buzz saw. The sawmill has remained closed since with many people claiming encounters with the ghost of Jack on nights similar to that of his death.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne {{hoped to}} build on the success of the 2008–09 season and began the new year with five {{straight}} victories. Soon, however, a string of setbacks hit the team, including the loss of two players, one due to injury and the other to suspension. Duquesne lost its final non-conference game <b>and</b> <b>slipped</b> <b>into</b> a five-game losing streak. The team did manage to break the streak, but had trouble gaining any momentum. In mid-February the Dukes finally seemed to break free with a solid 21point victory over La Salle, followed by a crucial road upset of the University of Charlotte, which was ranked first in the Atlantic 10 Conference at the time, and finally another upset of the University of Dayton Flyers in front of a sellout Pittsburgh crowd. However, Duquesne then lost its final two road games of the season.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately for John V, Andronikos IV {{and his son}} John VII escaped.

In exchange for Ottoman aid, Andronikos IV handed the fortress of Gallipoli over to the Ottomans, thus rendering the only genuine European aid, provided by Amadeo of Savoy, useless. Again, prison break became the next event with John V and Manuel escaping Constantinople, offering the Ottoman Sultan higher tribute than normally paid, in return for help in taking over Constantinople. Andronikos IV, having been beaten yet again, evaded capture <b>and</b> <b>slipped</b> <b>into</b> the Genoese district of Galata {{with his family and}} hostages. John V, only interested in securing his throne and stability, came to conclude a pact with Andronikos IV in 1381, recognizing him as heir with John VII as heir apparent, thus removing Manuel from the line of succession.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 50, Shore {{moved to}} Carmel, then a small art colony and resort, {{following}} in the footsteps of Weston, who had moved their shortly before. The natural beauty of Carmel provided Shore with ample painting inspiration. During this period she exhibited locally at the Carmel Art Association, the Legion of Honor, and the de Young Museum. She also had shows in New York and Paris. Despite these shows, Shore struggled financially during the Depression <b>and</b> <b>slipped</b> <b>into</b> relative obscurity, just as Weston began to achieve fame. Like many artists during this time, Shore relied on government commissions for income. In 1936 she received a commission for six murals from the Treasury Department's Section of Fine Arts. These murals, like many WPA commissions, focus on scenes of industry and work. Shore painted four lunettes for the Santa Cruz Post Office: Fishing Industry, Limestone Quarry Industry, Artichoke industry, and Brussel Sprouts Industry. She painted Artichoke Pickers in the Old Customhouse in Monterey and Monterey Bay 1880-1910 in the Monterey Post Office. These murals are her last prominent works.|$|E

500|$|In December 2010, {{following}} Gary Speed's {{departure from}} the job as manager of Sheffield United for the position as the head coach of Wales, Adams {{was one of a}} handful of names linked to the vacant position at United. On Christmas Eve, Vale chairman Bill Bratt announced he had [...] "reluctantly" [...] given Adams permission to talk to Sheffield United. Six days later it was announced that he would be taking the position, and he announced his three aims as manager would be to firstly avoid relegation, to then challenge for promotion, and finally [...] "to develop a structure that will build us a reputation for home grown talent that fans can be proud of in their team". Former United player Alan Cork was installed as his assistant, Cork had worked as Adams' assistant at Fulham, Swansea, Leicester and Coventry. The fourth manager at the club that season, he brought in Dave Bassett in a consultancy role after finding managing the club a bigger task than he had previously assumed. As Adams explained: [...] "When you're manager at Port Vale you probably get three calls a day and one of those is from the wife asking me what time I'm coming home for my tea." [...] His honeymoon period dissipated quickly, as United failed to win in his first eleven games in charge (four draws and seven defeats) <b>and</b> <b>slipped</b> <b>into</b> 23rd spot after letting slip a two-goal lead to lose 3–2 to fellow relegation strugglers Scunthorpe United. Adams told the press that [...] "The fans were singing 'you're not fit to wear the shirt', I cannot disagree with them. That is as disappointing a result as I have ever had in my career." [...] It took three months before he achieved his first win. The victory came on 8 March 2011 (his fourteenth game in charge), as his side came from behind to beat Nottingham Forest 2–1. Sheffield United were relegated to League One at the end of the season, finishing six points short of safety. Adams and United parted company after a meeting with owner Kevin McCabe. McCabe stated that he wished to initiate a [...] "clean sweep at the top and start afresh"; whilst Adams said that whilst he was [...] "very, very disappointed with the decision...

2500|$|By the fall, WHFV was in dire straits. Beginning Labor Day 1974, {{it became}} {{little more than}} a {{pass-through}} for NBC, as nearly all syndicated programs besides news and Donahue were removed from the schedule. The station filled out its schedule during non-network hours with a daily 4:30 pm movie, an unusually timed 7 pm local newscast, and one low-rent syndicated show in the 7:30 pm slot. Realizing the station was on the brink, Television Fredericksburg began advertising nationally for a buyer and had to resort to short-term loans to continue operations, but was not bringing in the money to pay them back <b>and</b> <b>slipped</b> <b>into</b> default. The Free-Lance Star reported that the station had been sued for more than $1 million owed to five local banks, two equipment lessors, and the IRS, in addition to reporting operating losses of $207,000 year-to-date in October 1974. One potential sale to Fairfax County businessman Charles Henry Smith, Jr. fell through in September. Smith expressed his opinion that the operation could turn a profit in several years, and its fatal mistake was going on the air without accounting for this; it clearly did not have enough cash on hand to survive even a year of losses.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1980 and 1989, Coronation Street {{underwent}} some of {{the biggest}} changes since its launch. By May 1984, Ken Barlow stood as the only original cast member, after the departures of Ena Sharples (in 1980), Annie Walker (in 1983), Elsie Tanner (in 1984) and Albert Tatlock (also 1984). In 1983, antihero Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson), one of the show's central male characters since 1961, was killed off, and in 1984, Stan Ogden (Bernard Youens) died. While the press predicted the end of Corrie, H. V. Kershaw declared that [...] "There are no stars in Coronation Street." [...] Writers drew on the show's many archetypes, with established characters stepping into the roles left by the original cast. Phyllis Pearce (Jill Summers) was hailed as the new Ena Sharples in 1982, the Duckworths moved into No.9 in 1983 <b>and</b> <b>slipped</b> <b>into</b> the role once held by the Ogdens, while Percy Sugden (Bill Waddington) appeared in 1983 and took over the grumpy war veteran role from Albert Tatlock. The question of who would take over the Rovers Return after Annie Walker's 1983 exit was answered in 1985 when Bet Lynch (who also mirrored the vulnerability and strength of Elsie Tanner) was installed as landlady. In 1983, Shirley Armitage became the first major black character in her role as machinist at Baldwin's Casuals.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effort of}} {{creating}} such a monumental pictureRoberts nicknamed it [...] "The Big Picture"took {{its toll on}} the artist. Nicknamed [...] "Bulldog", he drew {{a picture of a}} bulldog escaping a collar and chain in a letter he wrote informing that the picture was near completion. He described the painting once as his [...] "Frankenstein of 17 feet." [...] Roberts's eyesight was weakened by the strain in representing so many likenesses accurately and the importance that he placed on the task sapped his strength. The biographer Humphrey McQueen claims the picture gave Roberts [...] "an inflated idea of [...] own importance". However, Roberts never established himself as an artist in England <b>and</b> <b>slipped</b> <b>into</b> depression. The completion of the painting is generally seen as a turning point in his artistic career, after which his work never again reached the same heights. Roberts family reject this consensus as a [...] "myth", with his great-granddaughter, artist Lisa Roberts, stating [...] "His son, my grandfather, Caleb, documented that for a year he was depressed which isn't surprising after a huge commission like that that took him away from the thing he loved most which was the landscape. But after that, he went back to it. He continued to paint but not with the desire to be rich and famous." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 1985, {{rumors that}} Ellis had {{contracted}} AIDS began to surface {{when he appeared}} on the runway {{at the end of}} his Fall fashion show. By that time, Ellis had lost a considerable amount of weight and looked much older. Around the same time, Ellis' partner Laughlin Barker was undergoing chemotherapy for Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-related cancer which later metastasized to his lungs. Ellis continued to deny that he was sick, but rumors of his illness persisted after he passed out in the receiving line at a party at the Costume Institute in December 1985. On January 2, 1986, Barker died of lung cancer at the couple's home in Manhattan. After Barker's death, Ellis' health rapidly declined. By May 1986, Ellis had contracted viral encephalitis which caused paralysis on one side of his face. Despite his appearance, he insisted on appearing at his Fall fashion show held in New York City on May 8.

Lamba was playing for Dhaka's leading club, Abahani Krira Chakra, in the final of the Premier Division cricket match versus Mohammedan Sporting Club at the Dhaka Bangabandhu Stadium on 20 February 1998. The shot was so ferocious that the ball deflected from his head and flew into wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud' s gloves. He was not wearing a helmet. Mohammad Aminul Islam, the former Bangladesh captain, recalled [...] "I was the new man in and asked Raman if he was okay.

2500|$|From around 1451 the King's Privy Council was {{controlled}} by Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, who had effectively replaced the Duke of Suffolk as the King's chief councillor on the latter's death in 1450. Buckingham supported Somerset's government, while trying to maintain peace {{between him and the}} Duke of York. He also acted as a Commissioner of the Peace on 14 February 1452 in Devon, suppressing Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon who was preparing to join and support York. When York rebelled later that month and confronted the King with a large army at Dartford, Buckingham was again a voice of compromise, and, since he had contributed heavily towards the size of the King's army, was heeded. A year later, in August 1453, King Henry became ill, <b>and</b> <b>slipped</b> <b>into</b> a catatonic state. Government broke down. The situation remained through Christmas 1453, when Buckingham personally presented the King's son – the newly-born Edward, Prince of Wales – to Henry. But Henry [...] "gave no manner answer." [...] Buckingham was as also present at the council meeting which resulted in the arrest and subsequent year-long imprisonment of the Duke of Somerset, who by now was York's bitter enemy. In the parliament of February 1454 Buckingham was appointed Steward of England– although Griffiths has called this position [...] "largely honorific." [...] Buckingham also attended the parliament of February 1454 in which it was decided to nominate the duke of York as Protector of the Realm on 27 March 1454 and Buckingham supported him, attending the Protectorate council more frequently than many of his fellow councillors. King Henry recovered his health in January 1455, and, soon after, Somerset was released or escaped from the Tower. A contemporary commented how Buckingham [...] "straungely conveied" [...] Somerset from prison, but it is uncertain whether this was {{as a result of the}} King ordering his release or whether in fact Somerset escaped with Buckingham's connivance. Buckingham may well have been expecting war to break out at some point, because in 1454, he ordered 2,000 of his cognizances – the 'Stafford knot'– even though strictly this (the distribution of livery) was against the law.|$|E
