25|$|Traditional sailboats are monohulls, but {{multi-hull}} catamarans and trimarans {{are gaining}} popularity. Monohull boats generally rely on ballast for stability and usually are displacement hulls. This stabilizing ballast can, in {{boats designed for}} racing, {{be as much as}} 50% of the weight of the boat, but is generally around 30%. It creates two problems; one, it gives the monohull tremendous inertia, making it less maneuverable and reducing its acceleration. Secondly, unless it has been built with buoyant foam or <b>air</b> <b>tanks,</b> if a monohull fills with water, it will sink.|$|E
25|$|Abu Dhabi {{worked in}} the pearl {{business}} and traded with others. According to a source about pearling, the Persian Gulf was the best location for pearls. Pearl divers dove for one to one-and-a-half minutes, and would have dived up to thirty times per day. There were no <b>air</b> <b>tanks</b> and any other sort of mechanical device was forbidden. The divers had a leather nose clip and leather coverings on their fingers and big toes to protect them while they searched for oysters. The divers were not paid for a day’s work but received {{a portion of the}} season’s earnings.|$|E
25|$|Minifigure {{heads are}} cylindrical, and attach to a long, narrow {{cylinder}} molded {{onto the top}} of the torso, which allows the head to rotate.

The heads have a stud on top which is the same size as studs on standard Lego bricks which could allow one to be placed on it. The head is the only component of the minifigure which can be used for other applications - blank minifigure heads have often been used in Lego sets to replicate other objects such as lampshades and electrical appliances.|$|E

50|$|The Type 93 torpedo had a main chamber {{filled with}} pure {{compressed}} oxygen, a joint regulator valve preventing reverse flow, {{and a small}} (approximately 13-liter) high-pressure <b>air</b> <b>tank.</b> First, compressed <b>air</b> was mixed with fuel, and the mixture was supplied to a heat starter. Ignition started gently, with the mixture burning steadily in the engine (if oxygen was used at this stage, explosions were common). As the compressed air was consumed and lost pressure, high-pressure oxygen was supplied from the main chamber through the joint valve into the compressed <b>air</b> <b>tank.</b> Soon the <b>air</b> <b>tank</b> was filled with pure oxygen, and combustion continued in the engine.|$|R

But this discovery struck some searchers as inconsistent with Ben's supposed intent to explore the cave he was technically not permitted to enter. Most cave divers place their extra <b>air</b> <b>tanks,</b> which they need for decompression, at points along their route so they can follow them out, not {{at the entrance to the}} cave. And when tested, the tanks were found to contain just air, not the specialized gas mix Ben would have been likely to use had he been researching cave diving as his parents said he had been.|$|E
25|$|In 1942, {{during the}} German {{occupation}} of France, Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Émile Gagnan designed {{the first successful}} and safe open-circuit scuba, known as the Aqua-Lung. Their system combined an improved demand regulator with high-pressure <b>air</b> <b>tanks.</b> Émile Gagnan, an engineer employed by the Air Liquide company, miniaturized and adapted the regulator to use with gas generators, in response to constant fuel shortage that was a consequence of German requisitioning. Gagnan's boss, Henri Melchior, knew that his son-in-law Jacques-Yves Cousteau was looking for an automatic demand regulator to increase the useful period of the underwater breathing apparatus invented by Commander le Prieur, so he introduced Cousteau to Gagnan in December 1942. On Cousteau's initiative, the Gagnan's regulator was adapted to diving, and the new Cousteau-Gagnan patent was registered some weeks later in 1943.|$|E
25|$|While {{most experts}} agreed that a torpedo had exploded, they {{differed}} on {{what caused the}} explosion. Many Russians {{did not believe that}} Kursk could be so easily sunk. The tragedy spawned a number of wild conspiracy theories to explain the disaster. One theory offered was an explosion located in the high-pressure <b>air</b> <b>tanks</b> used to blow the ballast tanks, located near the torpedo tubes. Mainstream publications like Der Spiegel, Berliner Zeitung, and the Sunday Times claimed to possess documentation proving that the submarine was struck by a missile fired by Pyotr Velikiy. This was the largest naval exercise that the Russian navy had conducted in more than a decade, which increased the chances of a friendly fire incident. Other theories included Chechen espionage, human error, sabotage, and that Kursk was testing a new top-secret torpedo, Shkval (Squall), capable of speeds in excess of , for which the Western navies have no defence. Another theory was that USS Memphis had fired a torpedo at Kursk.|$|E

25|$|Only a few {{types of}} sharks are {{dangerous}} to humans. Out {{of more than}} 480 shark species, only three are responsible for two-digit numbers of fatal unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, tiger and bull; however, the oceanic whitetip has probably killed many more castaways which have not been recorded in the statistics. These sharks, being large, powerful predators, may sometimes attack and kill people; however, they have all been filmed in open water by unprotected divers. The 2010 French film Oceans shows footage of humans swimming next to sharks in the ocean. It {{is possible that the}} sharks are able to sense the presence of unnatural elements on or about the divers, such as polyurethane diving suits and <b>air</b> <b>tanks,</b> which may lead them to accept temporary outsiders as more of a curiosity than prey. Uncostumed humans, however, such as those surfboarding, light snorkeling or swimming, present a much greater area of exposed skin surface to sharks. In addition, the presence of even small traces of blood, recent minor abrasions, cuts, scrapes or bruises, may lead sharks to attack a human in their environment. Sharks seek out prey through electroreception, sensing the electric fields that are generated by all animals due to the activity of their nerves and muscles.|$|E

Despite heavy machine gun and artillery fire, Bourke returned {{to the scene of}} the wreck four times before they discovered two sailors and Vindictives badly wounded navigation officer Sir John Alleyne clinging to an upturned boat. Hauling the men aboard, Bourke turned for the safety of the open sea, but as he did, two [...] shells struck the launch, smashing the lifeboat and destroying the compressed <b>air</b> <b>tanks.</b> This stalled the engines and caused a wave of highly corrosive acid to wash over the deck, causing severe damage to the launch's hull and almost suffocating the unconscious Alleyne. Under heavy fire, the boat staggered out of the harbour and was taken under tow by another late-arriving motor launch. After the operation, Bourke's launch was discovered to have 55bullet and shrapnel holes.|$|E

The {{head of the}} coast guard diving team {{described}} the conditions inside the ship, still perched on a [...] ledge, as [...] "disastrous". Pitch-black conditions with large furniture drifting around made the rescue operation hazardous. Divers would find a path into the ship and tie down obstacles such as mattresses, before making noise to alert trapped people. The divers worked in pairs for safety and searched each assigned area slowly in a zig-zag manner. The search dives were planned as 40 minutes in duration, with sufficient extra compressed air in the scuba tanks in case of emergency. The divers had two torches (headlamps) positioned on their helmets because underwater visibility varied from approximately 5 to 60cm. In addition, divers marked their route by trailing a line {{to be used to}} lead them back out in low visibility and positioned extra emergency <b>air</b> <b>tanks</b> within the ship. The divers were from the Italian Navy, Coast Guard, and Vigili del Fuoco (fire and rescue service).|$|E
