5000|$|SAE 316L grade {{stainless}} steel {{is a standard}} for an <b>austenic</b> variety of {{stainless steel}} given the American SAE designation [...] "316L" [...] which indicates that this steel is low-carbon subtype of marine grade stainless steel containing 16-18% chromium, 10-14% nickel, 2.0-3.0% molybdenum, {{and no more than}} 0.03% carbon, 2% manganese, 0.75% silicon, 0.045% phosphorus, 0.03% sulphur, and 0.1% nitrogen by weight, with the remainder consisting entirely of iron (by comparison, regular 316 grade may contain up to 0.08% carbon by weight). It is the preferred variety of stainless steel used in medical devices. It is also the preferred grade of steel used to make coils for use in rebuildable atomizers in electronic cigarettes.|$|E
5000|$|SAE 904L grade {{stainless}} steel is a fully <b>austenic</b> low-carbon variety of {{stainless steel}} with additives of molybdenum and copper. Its high nickel and chromium content make it corrosion resistant in both oxidizing and reducing environments. The copper and molybdenum help to make it resistant to pitting as well as crevice corrosion. The nickel content makes it resistant to chloride SCC and the low proportion of carbon makes it resistant to intergranular corrosion. It is considered especially well-suited to handling sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid, though at high temperatures it {{may be subject to}} stress corrosion cracking. 904L stainless steel is also known as UNS N08904, WNR 1.4539, KS STS 317J5L, BS 904S13,WERKSTOFF NR. 1.4539, SUS 904l, EN X1NiCrMoCu25-20-5,SS2562 and DIN 17440.|$|E

40|$|TiNi alloy is polymorphic. It {{exhibits}} a martensitic transition near room temperature between a cubic CsCl-type (austenite) and a monoclinic TiNi-type (martensite) structure.

In <b>austenic</b> form, TiNi absorbs 1. 4 H/f. u. under atmospheric pressure.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{austenitic}} stainless steels are suitable for use in the final phases of orthodontic treatments, such as finishing and retention. These steels demonstrate appropriate mechanical properties, such as high ultimate tensile strength and good corrosion resistance. A new class of materials, the austenic-ferritic stainless steels, is substituting for austenitic stainless steels in several industrial applications where these properties are necessary. This work supports the hypothesis that orthodontic wires of austenic-ferritic stainless steels can replace austenitic stainless steels. The advantages are cost reduction and decrease of the nickel hypersensitivity effect in patients undergoing orthodontic treatments. The object {{of this study was to}} evaluate wires of austenitic-ferritic stainless steel SEW 410 Nr. 14517 (Cr 26 Ni 6 Mo 3 Cu 3) produced by cold working through rolling and drawing processes. Tests were performed to evaluate the ultimate tensile strength, hardness, ductility, and formability. In accordance with technical standards the wires exhibited ultimate tensile strength and ductility suitable for orthodontic clinical applications. These austenitie-ferritic wires can be an alternative to substitute the common commercial wires of <b>austenic</b> stainless steels with the advantage of decreasing the nickel content...|$|E
40|$|Ti-B-N {{films with}} a {{gradient}} in the chemical composition were deposited onto <b>austenic</b> {{stainless steel sheets}} by means of unbalanced DC magnetron co-sputtering using a segmented TiN/Tib 2 target. Film microstructure was characterized by means of electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD). The mechanical properties of the coatings were measured using a depth-sensing nanoindenter. The composition of the films was found to lie close to the quasi-bianary section Ti-B-N. The grain size determined from TEM investigations range between 3 and 5 nm. Coatings consisted of a nanocrystalline fcc TiN phase (with boron atoms and oxygen impurities dissolved), and TiB 2, TiB and B 2 O 3. Microstructure as well as chemical composition on the films were not influenced significantly by the deposition parameters used in this investigation. Contrary, the mechanical properties were strongly influenced varying the ion bombardment. hardness values exceeding 50 GPa and elastic moduli close to 500 GPa were obtained. 1998 Published by Elselvier Science Ltd.

40|$|Starting Point of the {{investigations}} is the stochastic mean value constitutive model of STECK {{and the model}} of MILLER (MATMOD) in the original version. While Miller's model is mainly based on phenomenological observations {{the background of the}} stochastic model lies in a physical well founded description of dislocation movements in the material. Both models are adjusted to onedimensional experiments to perform multiaxial experiments and to compare them with the model predictions. The numerical part is divided into a comparison of different integration methods, in the determination of the material parameters and in the computation of multiaxial problems with the finite element method using the commercial program ABAQUS and the own program FEMI. Besides the investigation of different numerical methods for the mathematical solution of the constitutive equations, parameter determinations are performed for two materials, high purity aluminium Al 99. 999 and <b>austenic</b> steel AISI SS 316 L. With stainless steel experiments are carried out, which are divided into onedimensional creep and relaxation tests and multiaxial experiments with a hollow plate. The material for the different kind of experiments is taken from the same material charge. For the multiaxial experiments a new surface grid technique can be used, which allows the measurement of strain fields in a fotografical way. A good correlation between experiment and model prediction can be shown. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract. A new {{analytical}} {{prediction of}} the phase transformation zone around the crack tip is proposed for shape memory alloys. The present analysis integrates the asymmetry between tension and compression in the yield surface of phase transformation around the crack tip. Shapes and sizes of the phase transformation zone are predicted for loading modes I, II and III. Furthermore, an experimental investigation for mode I loading fracture tests on edge-cracked specimens of a nickel-titanium alloy is currently performing {{with a particular}} attention devoted on displacement and temperature fields evolution around the crack tip. The use of shape memory alloys (SMAs), for instance smart structures actuators, has a great appeal for industrial applications, mostly in medical device or aeronautics. SMAs own very large recoverable strains (of the order of 8 % for NiTi alloys) {{as a result of}} a phase transformation from austenite to martensite. Thus, the investigation of the SMAs fracture is a relevant question in order to improve service life of systems. The linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) theory allows knowing the stress field around the crack tip which depends on the loading mode. Theoretically, the stress field around the crack tip is unbounded. However, as usual elastic materials undergo yielding at the crack tip, SMAs accommodate the applied stress through a material phase change. If a sheet initially in the <b>austenic</b> state is mechanical loaded, applied stress induces the creation of a martensitic phase transformation region in the vicinity of the crack tip. In this case, the crack tip region is governed by the stres...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} a liquid on a {{deformable}} structure is studied in different scales, both experimentally and theoretically. Based on the balance and constitutive equations, the similarity conditions are derived. A compressible Newtonian fluid is assumed. An elastic, viscoplastic behavior of the structure is considered and the thermomechanical coupling is included. The similarity conditions are discussed for various restrictions. The influence of size, expected for replica models, is examined by experiments in the scales 1 : 1, 1 : 2. 5 and 1 : 10 (FLIPPER experiments). Herein, water is accelerated by a drop weight and bending joints are deformed plastically due {{to the impact of}} the water on a target plate. For the bending joints the structural steel St 37, the aluminium alloy AlZnMgCu 1. 5 and the <b>austenic</b> steel X 5 CrNi 18 9 are used. The scale influence is revealed by the moderately decreasing mean value of the bending angle with decreasing size, which can be interpreted by the strain-rate sensitivity. The results for the different drop heights show that the ratio between the kinetic energy of the liquid and the dissipated energy in the bending joints depends weakly on the scale and the fall height. The reason of the large scatter for nominally identical tests, characteristic for all experiments, is explained by means of a structural dynamic model. Tests with perforated target plates indicate that the influence of the fluid viscosity is almost negligible. (orig.)
