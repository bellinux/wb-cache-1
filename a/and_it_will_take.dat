25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{increased}} demand and tightening restrictions on exports of the metals from China, some countries are stockpiling rare-earth resources. Searches for alternative sources in Australia, Brazil, Canada, South Africa, Tanzania, Greenland, and the United States are ongoing. Mines in these countries were closed when China undercut world prices in the 1990s, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> a few years to restart production as there are many barriers to entry. One example is the Mountain Pass mine in California, which announced its resumption of operations on a start-up basis on August 27, 2012. Other significant sites under development outside of China include the Nolans Project in Central Australia, the remote Hoidas Lake project in northern Canada, and the Mount Weld project in Australia. The Hoidas Lake project has the potential to supply about 10% of the $1 billion of REE consumption that occurs in North America every year. Vietnam signed an agreement in October 2010 to supply Japan with rare earths from its northwestern Lai Châu Province.|$|E

500|$|The Internet {{service that}} Mya was {{developed}} for was called Myosphere. Motorola began development of Myosphere in 1998, {{and it had been}} described as a speech enabled service [...] "which enables consumers to manage and control wireless and wireline communications from a single point of access using natural voice commands." [...] Several other companies had already announced plans for similar software at the time; Alan Reiter from Wireless Internet and Mobile Computing was puzzled at Motorola's announcement of Myosphere, saying [...] "They're kind of late to the [...] party.

500|$|When Taft entered office, Mexico was {{increasingly}} restless under {{the grip of}} longtime dictator Porfirio Díaz. Many Mexicans backed his opponent, Francisco Madero. There {{were a number of}} incidents in which Mexican rebels crossed the U.S. border to obtain horses and weapons; Taft sought to prevent this by ordering the US Army to the border areas for maneuvers. Taft told his military aide, Archibald Butt, that [...] "I am going to sit on the lid <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> a great deal to pry me off". He showed his support for Díaz by meeting with him at El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, the first meeting between a U.S. and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president visited Mexico. The day of the summit, Frederick Russell Burnham and a Texas Ranger captured and disarmed an assassin holding a palm pistol only {{a few feet from the}} two presidents. Before the election in Mexico, Díaz jailed opposition candidate Madero, whose supporters took up arms. This resulted in both the ousting of Díaz and a revolution that would continue for another ten years. In the U.S.'s Arizona Territory, two citizens were killed and almost a dozen injured, some as a result of gunfire across the border. Taft was against an aggressive response and so instructed the territorial governor.|$|E
500|$|An {{expansion}} of the metro, the City Circle Line, is under construction and {{scheduled to open in}} 2019. [...] Independent of the existing system, it will circle the city center and connect the areas of Østerbro, Nørrebro and Vesterbro to Frederiksberg and Indre By. The line will be [...] long and run entirely in tunnel. The circle will have 17stations, two of which are interchanges with both the M1 and M2 lines, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> 25 minutes to complete a full circle. Archaeological and geological surveys started in 2007, preferred bidders were announced in November 2010 and contracts were signed in 2011. Preparations began by moving utilities etc. in 2010, and construction of work sites and stations began in 2011. Drilling of tunnels will begin in 2013. On 7 January 2011 the new project called Cityringen started with the signature by Metroselskabet of new contracts, with Ansaldo Breda and Ansaldo Sts (Finmeccanica Group) for the supply of trains and control systems and with an Italian joint-venture led by Salin Construttori (about 60%) and Tecnimont (about 40%) with Seli as third partner for the construction part. In July 2013, Natur- og Miljøklagenævnet, the environmental appeals board, ruled that the city was wrong to grant Metroselskabet persmission for 24-hour work days and noise up to 78 db at the Marmorkirken site. The company is now required to stop work 6PM until a final ruling is made, which could take up to half a year, potentially delaying the completion date.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the return}} of Micky Adams as Port Vale manager, Tomlinson held on to his first team place {{at the start of}} the 2011–12 season, though Martin was used in cup games. Neither Tomlinson or Martin could find the {{consistency}} to secure their first team place though; Tomlinson conceded twelve goals in his first seven games of the season, whilst Martin conceded ten times in his first five games. Assistant manager Mark Grew told the media that [...] "they've both been disappointing". On 29 October, Tomlinson was embarrassed to be caught off his line by Oxford United's Peter Leven, who found the net with a 'sensational 45-yard strike'. Adams said [...] "...in the division, he's the only player who would have scored that... you have to question the keeper's starting position." [...] He was still preferred to Martin though, and only a thigh injury kept him out of two league games in January. He returned to the first team, and was heading for a third consecutive clean sheet on 14 February when he committed an [...] "injury-time howler" [...] to allow Bradford City a share of the points at Valley Parade. On 10 March he spilled a cross to hand Barnet striker Ben May an easy winner at Vale Park. He vowed to improve his consistency, saying [...] "I'm a pretty confident person <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> a lot to stop me bouncing back." [...] At the end of the season he rejected the club's offer of a new contract, and his departure was announced on 3 July.

2500|$|With Primrose having recovered, Travis regrouped and re-evaluated. Moving into {{a cottage}} in Crear, Argyll and Bute, {{they set up}} a small studio, and over two weeks, came up with nine new songs that would form the basis of their fourth studio album, 2003's 12 Memories. Produced by Travis themselves, Tchad Blake, and Steve Orchard, the album marked a move into more organic, moody and {{political}} territory for the band. Although this seems to have alienated some fans, the album generally received very positive reviews (for example, [...] "Then, of course, there's Travis and their album 12 Memories [...] You just have to sit there and listen to it all the way through, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> you on a real journey.

It's like the Beatles' Revolver [...] Fran Healy's voice and lyrics are mesmerizing and beautiful"—Elton John), singles such as [...] "Re-Offender" [...] did very well on the British charts, and the album itself reached No.3. Yet it also saw them lose ground in the U.S., where Coldplay had usurped Travis during their 2002 absence. Much later, Fran Healy spoke about the album as a whole being about him working through his own clinical depression, and the 12 memories being 12 reasons for him reaching his depressed state. At the time this wasn't mentioned, but the revelation that Healy was depressed ties in with the band's decision to take longer writing and releasing their next work.|$|E
