25|$|The {{crash was}} caused {{primarily}} by the aircraft's automated reaction which was triggered by a faulty radio altimeter. This caused the <b>autothrottle</b> to decrease the engine power to idle during approach. The crew noticed this too late to take appropriate action to increase the thrust and recover the aircraft before it stalled and crashed. Boeing has since issued a bulletin to remind pilots of all 737 series and BBJ aircraft {{of the importance of}} monitoring airspeed and altitude, advising against the use of autopilot or <b>autothrottle</b> while landing in cases of radio altimeter discrepancies.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch Safety Board {{stated that}} the {{approach}} was not stabilized so the crew should have initiated a go around. The autopilot followed the glide slope while the <b>autothrottle</b> reduced thrust to idle due to a faulty radio altimeter showing an incorrect height. This caused the airspeed to drop and the pitch attitude to increase all unnoticed by the crew until the stick shaker activated. Prior to this, air traffic control caused the crew to intercept the glide slope from above and this obscured the erroneous <b>autothrottle</b> mode and increased the crew’s workload. The subsequent approach to stall recovery procedure was not executed properly, causing the aircraft to stall and crash.|$|E
25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the PC-24 is {{designed}} for efficiency and to reduce pilot workload. Marketed as the Advanced Cockpit Environment (ACE), information is displayed on four 12-inch liquid-crystal displays (LCDs). Pilatus selected Honeywell to develop and supply the ACE avionics suite. It uses {{some of the same}} avionics used in the Pilatus PC-12, in addition to those developed specifically for the PC-24. Standard avionics equipment includes a synthetic vision system, <b>autothrottle,</b> Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS II), localizer performance with vertical guidance and graphic flight planning system.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{approaches}} {{were conducted}} in flight director mode, with the autopilot and <b>autothrottles</b> disengaged. There were no significant heading or altitude deviations from the prescribed approach course.|$|R
50|$|In February 2014 the FAA {{approved}} <b>autothrottles</b> and anti-skid brakes for the 550. The manufacturer {{claims the}} new braking system {{will stop the}} aircraft in 700 ft from normal landing speeds.|$|R
50|$|The 550 was {{developed}} from the earlier Eclipse 500, enabled by Sikorsky Aircraft's investment in Eclipse Aerospace in 2010. It retains the 500's airframe and PW610F engines, but incorporates an improved avionics package, including satellite phones, <b>autothrottles,</b> synthetic vision and enhanced vision systems, as well as anti-skid brakes.|$|R
25|$|During {{the final}} approach, the plane descended along the ILS {{glideslope}} until at about 700ft, the crew visually acquired the runway. They disengaged the autopilot but left the <b>autothrottle</b> on. During the flare, {{the rate of}} descent was not arrested, the plane landed with the right wing slightly lower. The right landing gear touched down first, the right engine impacted the runway and the right wing was detached from the fuselage. Since the left wing was still attached, the lift from that wing rolled the fuselage onto its right side, and the plane came to rest inverted in the grass strip next to the runway. The spilled fuel caught fire.|$|E
25|$|They are low wing, T-tail {{airplanes}} with cabin pressurization, {{powered by}} two rear mounted turbofans. The landing gear is fully retractable {{and designed to}} be operated on paved runways only. The glass cockpit includes four multi-function displays. The operation is made through a flight management system with autopilot, <b>autothrottle</b> and closed-loop control and monitoring of flight controls Fly-By-Wire. The aircraft are certified for Day, Night, VFR and IFR flights, and are approved for reduced vertical separation minima (RVSM) airspace and flight into known icing conditions, extended flight over water, Category II ILS, operations at high altitude airports up to 13800ft and steep approach operations.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} accident was the loss of spatial orientation by the crew and chiefly by the Captain who was piloting the aircraft during the landing phase. The plane banked left, overturned and went into a rapid descent. The loss of spatial orientation occurred in the night, while flying in the clouds, with autopilot and <b>autothrottle</b> switched off. Poor CRM and insufficient training for using the Western type of attitude indicators contributed to the accident. The pilots had previously flown Tupolev Tu-134 and Antonov An-24 with {{a different type of}} attitude indicator (where the bank angle is shown by the movements of an aircraft symbol, and the indicator's background does not turn left or right).|$|E
50|$|The {{failure of}} the first officer to push the correct button to engage the <b>autothrottles</b> at the {{beginning}} of the takeoff roll. He then manually advanced the throttles; the resultant delay and the slightly low thrust set on the left engine lengthened the airplane's ground roll and added to the directional control problem.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2013 the FAA {{approved}} the Eclipse 550 for a fatigue limit of 20,000 hours or 20,000 cycles with an unlimited calendar life. In August 2013 {{it was announced}} that the aircraft would incorporate <b>autothrottles,</b> new EFIS software, an anti-lock braking system and a high-resolution 3.25" [...] x 4.3" [...] standby display.|$|R
5000|$|Cessna {{formally}} {{announced the}} aircraft on February 6, 2008 FAA certification was planned {{by the end}} of 2013, with deliveries beginning in 2014. The Columbus had a target range of 4000 nmi km with 8 passengers. The cockpit would have featured a synthetic vision system, <b>autothrottles,</b> optional head-up display and Collins' MultiScan weather radar with optional windshear prediction.|$|R
500|$|Full-regime {{autopilot}} and <b>autothrottle</b> allowing [...] "hands off" [...] {{control of}} the aircraft from climb out to landing ...|$|E
500|$|Flight Data Recorder (FDR) {{information}} recovered {{after the}} crash and released by Brazilian authorities showed that immediately prior to touchdown, both thrust levers were in CL (or [...] "climb") position, with engine power being governed by the flight computer's <b>autothrottle</b> system. Two seconds prior to touchdown, an aural warning, [...] "retard, retard," [...] was issued by the flight's computer system, advising the pilots to [...] "retard" [...] the thrust lever to the recommended idle or reverse thrust lever position. This would disengage the aircraft's <b>autothrottle</b> system, with engine power then being governed directly by the thrust lever's position.|$|E
500|$|The delta-shaped wings {{required}} Concorde {{to adopt}} a higher angle of attack at low speeds than conventional aircraft, but it allowed the formation of large low pressure vortices over the entire upper wing surface, maintaining lift. The normal landing speed was [...] Because of this high angle, during a landing approach Concorde was on the [...] "back side" [...] of the drag force curve, where raising the nose would increase the rate of descent; the aircraft was thus largely flown on the throttle and was fitted with an <b>autothrottle</b> to reduce the pilot's workload.|$|E
50|$|The {{advent of}} FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) engines permits {{operation}} of the flight control systems and <b>autothrottles</b> for the engines to be fully integrated. On modern military aircraft other systems such as autostabilization, navigation, radar and weapons system are all integrated with the flight control systems. FADEC allows maximum performance to be extracted from the aircraft without fear of engine misoperation, aircraft damage or high pilot workloads.|$|R
2500|$|Other [...] "contributing factors" [...] were {{a lack of}} {{compliance}} with standard operating procedures, a lack of crew resource management, and a significant gap in bad weather flights by the PIC (he had not flown in weather conditions similar to Smolensk that day in four months). Additional [...] "contributing factors" [...] were the Navigator calling out radar altitudes without considering the uneven terrain in the area, utilization of the autopilot and <b>autothrottles</b> much lower than minimum descent altitude which did not comply with the Flight Crew Operations Manual for the Tu-154, and the late start of the final descent which caused the crew to maintain a higher than normal vertical speed.|$|R
40|$|Refinements in {{the lateral}} and {{longitudinal}} guidance for an {{automatic landing system}} capable of curved trajectories were studied. Wing flaps or drag flaps (speed brakes) were found to provide faster and more precise speed control than <b>autothrottles.</b> In {{the case of the}} lateral control it is shown that the use of the integral of the roll error in the roll command over the first 30 to 40 seconds of flight reduces the sensitivity of the lateral guidance to the gain on the azimuth guidance angle error in the roll command. Also, changes to the guidance algorithm are given that permit pi-radian approaches and constrain the airplane to fly in a specified plane defined by the position of the airplane at the start of letdown and the flare point...|$|R
500|$|At {{the moment}} of touchdown, the spoiler lever was in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position. According to the system logic of the A320's flight controls, {{in order for the}} {{spoilers}} to automatically deploy upon touchdown not only must the spoiler lever be in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position, but both thrust levers must be at or close to the [...] "idle" [...] position. The FDR transcript shows that immediately after the warning, the flight computer recorded the left thrust lever being retarded to the rear-most position, activating the thrust reverser on the left engine, while the right thrust lever (controlling the engine with the disabled thrust reverser) remained in the CL position. One theory put forth by CENIPA is that the pilots may not have noticed that the right engine remained at CL because the Airbus <b>autothrottle</b> system, unlike other aircraft manufacturers, does not automatically move the levers when the autothrust controller changes engine settings. Therefore, the pilots may have thought that the right engine was at idle power without realizing that Airbus autothrust logic dictates that, when {{one or more of the}} thrust levers is pulled to the idle position, the autothrust is automatically disengaged. Thus, when the pilot pulled the left engine thrust lever to idle, it disconnected the autothrust system and the computer did not retard the right engine power to idle. The A320's spoilers did not deploy during the landing run, as the right thrust lever was above the [...] "idle" [...] setting required for automatic spoiler deployment. Since the right engine thrust lever was still in the [...] "climb" [...] detent at that time, the right engine accelerated to climb power while the left engine deployed its thrust reverser. The resulting asymmetric thrust condition resulted in a loss of control and a crash ensued.|$|E
2500|$|Based on a {{preliminary}} review of FDR data, the NTSB stated {{there was no}} anomalous behavior of the engines, the autopilot, the flight director, or the <b>autothrottle.</b> The <b>autothrottle</b> control {{was found to be}} in the [...] "armed" [...] position during documentation of cockpit levers and switches, differing from both the [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off" [...] positions. Furthermore, the pilot flying's flight director (Primary Flight Display) was deactivated whereas the instructor pilot's was activated (this may prove to be significant, as deactivating neither or both Flight Directors enables and forces an <b>autothrottle</b> [...] "wake-up" [...] whereas deactivating only one Flight Director inhibits an <b>autothrottle</b> [...] "wake-up"). All three fire handles were extended; these operate safety equipment intended to put out fires on the aircraft (a handle for each engine and the auxiliary power unit). The speedbrake lever was down, showing it was not being used.|$|E
2500|$|The {{throttles}} {{were pulled}} back to idle thrust {{to slow the}} aircraft to descend and acquire the glideslope, but the <b>autothrottle</b> unexpectedly reverted to [...] "retard" [...] mode, {{which is designed to}} automatically decrease thrust shortly before touching down on the runway at [...] above runway height. At 144 kt, the pilots manually increased thrust to sustain that speed, but the <b>autothrottle</b> immediately returned the thrust lever to idle power because the first officer did not hold the throttle lever in position. The throttles remained at idle for about 100 seconds while the aircraft slowed to , [...] below reference speed as the aircraft descended below the required height to stay on the glideslope. The stick-shaker activated at about [...] above the ground, indicating an imminent stall, the <b>autothrottle</b> advanced, and the captain attempted to apply full power. The engines responded, but there was not enough altitude or forward airspeed to recover, and the aircraft hit the ground tail-first at [...]|$|E
40|$|An {{engineering}} {{study to}} determine the feasibility of applying the NASA (ARC) two-segment approach procedures and avionics to the Boeing fleet of commercial jet transports is presented. This feasibility study {{is concerned with the}} speed/path control and systems compability aspects of the procedures. Path performance data are provided for representative Boeing 707 / 727 / 737 / 747 passenger models. Thrust margin requirements for speed/path control are analyzed for still air and shearing tailwind conditions. Certification of the two-segment equipment and possible effects on existing airplane certification are discussed. Operational restrictions on use of the procedures with current <b>autothrottles</b> and in icing or reported tailwind conditions are recommended. Using the NASA/UAL 727 procedures as a baseline, maximum upper glide slopes for representative 707 / 727 / 737 / 747 models are defined {{as a starting point for}} further study and/or flight evaluation programs...|$|R
2500|$|The Terrain Awareness Warning System (abbreviated TAWS, {{although}} more correctly {{referred to as}} an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System or EGPWS) fired its first audible warning [...] "terrain ahead!" [...] at 10:40:06. This was because the Smolensk airport, as a former military airfield not open to international flights, {{was not in the}} system's database and therefore the system did not recognize that the airplane was approaching an airport. Six seconds later, someone (most likely the captain or navigator) pressed a button on the captain's FMS panel commanding standard barometric pressure be set on the captain's main electronic altimeter. This had the effect of increasing the altimeter's reading by as the TAWS takes readings from this particular altimeter, this had the additional effect of silencing the warning. The captain's secondary (mechanical) and the copilot's main electronic pressure altimeters continued to read correctly. As the descent continued, the crew realized they had started descent too late. To compensate for this, they increased their vertical speed to , twice the prescribed rate for a normal approach. The aircraft did not have enough drag to maintain speed with this rate of descent, so even though the <b>autothrottles</b> commanded idle power from the engines, the speed of the aircraft increased to approximately [...] higher than specified.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} incidents reported to NASA’s Aviation Safety Reporting System from a novel perspective: {{rather than focusing}} on the factors contributing to or causing incidents, this study concentrated on who and what (subsystems and information) enabled the recovery from an anomaly. Incident reports describing altitude deviations were classified as to cockpit type (glass or traditional), flight phase, agent restoring safety, and cockpit subsystems providing specific information that helped restore safety. The data revealed and quantified the agents, information, and factors that “saved the day. ” The flight crews used many sources of information to detect the altitude deviations: altimeter, outside scene, altitude alert, kinesthesia, attitude, and communications monitoring. In the glass cockpits the crews also used the map display and <b>autothrottles</b> to detect deviations from assigned altitudes. There was an interaction between the person detecting the anomaly (controller/flight crew) and the type of cockpit. Glass cockpit flight crews detect proportionally more deviations than their counterparts in traditional cockpits, while controllers tend to detect more deviations involving traditional cockpits. There was no effect of cockpit position (captain/first officer). A model that details the flow of altitude information between air traffic control, flight crews, and cockpit subsystems was developed and validated. This model identifies strengths and weaknesses in the flow of altitude information within the current ground/air system...|$|R
2500|$|The final enquiry report {{stated that}} [...] "after the base turn, {{approaching}} the landing course at 600 m with both autopilot and <b>autothrottle</b> disengaged, the aircraft started climbing up to 1300 m, rolled 360° over {{the left wing}} and collided with the ground".|$|E
2500|$|The {{data from}} the flight {{recorder}} also showed that the same altimeter problem had happened twice during the previous eight landings but that on both occasions the crew had taken the correct action by disengaging the <b>autothrottle</b> and manually increasing the thrust. Investigations {{are under way to}} determine why more action had not been taken after the altimeter problem was detected. In response to the preliminary conclusions, Boeing issued a bulletin, Multi-Operator Message (MOM) 09-0063-01B, to remind pilots of all 737 series and Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) aircraft of the importance of monitoring airspeed and altitude (the [...] "primary flight instruments"), advising against the use of autopilot or <b>autothrottle</b> while landing in cases of radio altimeter discrepancies. Following the release of the preliminary report, Dutch and international press concluded that pilot inattention caused the accident, though several Turkish news publications still emphasized other possible causes.|$|E
2500|$|The latest variant (Tu-154M-100, {{introduced}} 1998) {{includes an}} NVU-B3 Doppler navigation system, a triple autopilot, which provides an automatic ILS approach according to ICAO category II weather minima, an <b>autothrottle,</b> a Doppler drift and speed measure system (DISS), and a [...] "Kurs-MP" [...] radio navigation suite.

40|$|Flightdeck Interval Management {{is one of}} the NextGen {{operational}} {{concepts that}} FAA is sponsoring to realize requisite National Airspace System (NAS) efficiencies. Interval Management will reduce variability in temporal deviations at a position, and thereby reduce buffers typically applied by controllers - resulting in higher arrival rates, and more efficient operations. Ground software generates a strategic schedule of aircraft pairs. Air Traffic Control (ATC) provides an IM clearance with the IM spacing objective (i. e., the TTF, and at which point to achieve the appropriate spacing from this aircraft) to the IM aircraft. Pilots must dial FIM speeds into the speed window on the Mode Control Panel in a timely manner, and attend to deviations between actual speed and the instantaneous FIM profile speed. Here, the crew is assumed to be operating the aircraft with <b>autothrottles</b> on, with autopilot engaged, and the autoflight system in Vertical Navigation (VNAV) and Lateral Navigation (LNAV); and is responsible for safely flying the aircraft while maintaining situation awareness of their ability to follow FIM speed commands and to achieve the FIM spacing goal. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine whether three Notification Methods and four Avionics Conditions affect pilots' performance, ratings on constructs associated with performance (workload, situation awareness), or opinions on acceptability. Three Notification Methods (alternate visual and aural alerts that notified pilots to the onset of a speed target, conformance deviation from the required speed profile, and reminded them if they failed to enter the speed within 10 seconds) were examined. These Notification Methods were: VVV (visuals for all three events), VAV (visuals for all three events, plus an aural for speed conformance deviations), and AAA (visual indications and the same aural to indicate all three of these events). Avionics Conditions were defined by the instrumentation (and location) used to present IM information to crews: (1) Integrated (IM information is embedded in extant PFD (Primary Flight Display), ND (Navigation Display), EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) displays); (2) EFB_Aft (IM information is only supplied in an EFB and mounted in location similar to that for MITRE's UPS work); (3) EFB_Fore (IM information is only supplied in an EFB which is mounted more forward, under the side window), and (4) EFB_Aft plus use of an AGD (the same IM information is supplied in an EFB and on an AGD, both mounted in locations similar to that in MITRE's UPS work). Twelve commercial pilot crews flew descent scenarios (VNAV Speed with the mode control panel (MCP) speed window open until flaps extended, then VNAV Path) in a commercial transport flight simulator with realistic visual scene and communications. The results of this study serve three practical aims: (1) contribute to the down-select of avionics configuration for future assessment of the ASTAR spacing algorithm at NASA; (2) provide information useful to the FAA Human Factors Division (ANG-C 1) 's mission to identify issues pertinent to flight certification of, and flight standards; (3) identify methodological considerations in support of future FIM human-in-the-loop (HITL) investigations...|$|R

Based on preliminary data from the flight data recorder (FDR), the NTSB said the plane's airspeed on final approach fell to 34 knots below its target approach speed of 137 knots (254km/h; 158mph). A preliminary review of FAA radar return data did not show an abnormally steep descent curve, although the crew did recognize that they began high on the final approach. At a height of , eight seconds before impact, the airspeed had dropped to [...] According to initial reports from the cockpit crew, the plane's <b>autothrottle</b> was set for the correct reference speed, but until the runway's precision approach path indicator (PAPI) showed them significantly below the glide path, the pilots were unaware the <b>autothrottle</b> was failing to maintain that speed. The instructor pilot stated that the PAPI indicated a deviation below the glide path at approximately 500 feet above ground level, and he attempted to correct it at that time.
