50|$|A soap {{dispenser}} is a device that, when manipulated or triggered appropriately, dispenses soap (usually in small, single-use quantities). It can be manually operated {{by means of}} a handle, or can be <b>automatic.</b> <b>Soap</b> <b>dispensers</b> are often found in public toilets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers</b> (also {{known as}} {{touchless}} or no-touch soap dispensers) dispense a controlled amount of soap solution (or a similar liquid {{such as a}} hand sanitizer). They are often {{used in conjunction with}} automatic faucets in public restrooms. They function to conserve the amount of soap used and stem infectious disease transmission.|$|E
50|$|An <b>automatic</b> <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> is {{specifically}} a hands-free <b>dispenser</b> of <b>soap</b> (both liquid soap and foaming soap), but generally {{can be used}} for other liquids such as hand sanitizers, shampoos, or hand lotions. Automatic dispensers are often battery-powered. The touch-free design dispenses the liquid when a sensor detects motion under the nozzle. The electronic components of an <b>automatic</b> <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> allow for a timing device or signal (sound, lights, etc.) which can indicate to the user whether they have washed their hands for the correct amount of time or not.|$|R
25|$|Sprinkling with {{holy water}} {{is used as}} a sacramental that recalls baptism. Holy water is kept in the holy water font, which is {{typically}} located {{at the entrance to the}} church (or sometimes in a separate room or building called a baptistery). Smaller vessels, called stoups, are usually placed at the entrances of the church, to enable people to sprinkle themselves with it on entering. In recent years, with the concerns over influenza, new holy water machines that work like an <b>automatic</b> <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> have become popular.|$|R
50|$|The {{advancement}} of the <b>automatic</b> <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> further creates an even more sterile environment. When various individuals use the pump, they will leave behind a variety of bacterial colonies. These colonies will interbreed and {{lead to a more}} resistant strain of bacteria that can re-contaminate different hands and would not be completely eliminated by the anti-bacterial soap. Wider spectra or higher levels of resistance, in the colonies that are present, are due to interaction and/or complementation between the resistance genes. Without having a wide variety of individuals touching the pump, bacterial transmission will be eliminated.|$|R
5000|$|The filth, poverty, {{disease that}} {{permeated}} nineteenth century’s society was drastically reduced by revolutionary sanitation movements throughout the twentieth century. Although several other advances... can be etiologically and temporally related {{to some of}} these diseases, the causal evidence (e.g., temporal sequence, consistency, biologic plausibility) is consistent with the hypothesis that personal hygiene is one other factor that helped to determine the decline.The advances of hygiene, such as that of the <b>automatic</b> <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser,</b> can be considered as one of the more silent victories of public health and continues to be an important disease prevention strategy, even in this [...] "modern" [...] era when the [...] "gospel of germs" [...] has waned in popularity.|$|R
50|$|The {{pipeline}} and all {{milk handling}} systems are cleaned after every milking session using a washing system that first rinses out the remaining milk and then flushes cleaning solution through the piping to kill bacteria and remove milkstone, {{a layer of}} scale mainly formed by cations like calcium and magnesium. The entire washing mechanism is operated {{very much like a}} household dishwasher with an <b>automatic</b> fill system, <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser,</b> and <b>automatic</b> drain opener.|$|R
40|$|<b>Soap</b> <b>Dispenser</b> is a {{personal}} care product which includes liquid <b>soap</b> and <b>dispenser.</b> This product generally use to washing a hand where {{can be found at}} the most toilet or restaurant. There has a lot of <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> design and shape can be found in the market. The functions of the entire <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> are almost same which is to dispense a liquid soap. The main objective of the project was to design and develop a multipurpose <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> prototype. An additional function may be adapted to the current <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> to enhance the ability of the <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> in order to meet the current demand. The process of development may be conducted based on several tools of idea and concept generation such as New Product Development (NPD) and Design for Manufacturing (DFM). The development was focused on the additional functions and performance of the product. Another wish was to increase consistency and reliability of the prototyped product. An initial pre-study gave insight in how to come out with multipurpose functions that can be adapted into the <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser.</b> A wide variety of <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> and the other hygiene care product were studied to obtain complete understanding. Next phase was to generate ideas and new concepts which after the product and concept evaluation resulted from the analysis. These concepts were made as functional mock-ups for further testing and evaluation and finally built as a fully prototype. A new multipurpose <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> prototype finally produced by using Fortus 360 mc prototype machine. The recommended additional functions from the customer’s survey for a new multipurpose <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> prototype are mini dustbin and tissue compartment. The product can be assembled and functions as expected. Thus, objective of the project is achieved successfully...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the possibilities in designing an artefact that will motivate {{high school students}} to wash their hands. The behavioural ideology called libertarian paternalism introduced in the book Nudge, will be the consistent theory throughout the design process. The theory originate from a wish that people should be better at making good decisions for themselves. A range of moral issues appear within this theory. Those will be discussed and result in a moral goal for the design in our project. With this theory in mind we came up with a concept containing music playing <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers.</b> The concept is that these <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers</b> play music every time they’re used.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{describes}} {{an outbreak of}} Serratia marcescens and its investigation and control in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). During a three-month period, five infants were colonised or infected by a single strain of S. marcescens. A case-control study, culture surveys and pulse-field gel electrophoresis analysis implicated a bottle <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> as a reservoir of S. marcescens (P= 0. 032). Infants with S. marcescens colonisation or infection {{were also more likely}} to have been exposed to a central or percutaneous venous catheter (P= 0. 05) and had had longer exposure to endotracheal intubation (P= 0. 05). <b>Soap</b> <b>dispensers</b> are used in many hospitals and may be an unrecognised source of nosocomial infections. This potential source of infection could be reduced by using 'airless' dispensers which have no air intake for the distribution of soap.

40|$|There {{are limited}} data on Enterobacter cloacae {{outbreaks}} and fewer describing these {{in association with}} NDM- 1. With whole-genome sequencing, we tested the hypothesis that a cluster of 16 E. cloacae bacteraemia cases in a Nepali neonatal unit represented a single clonal outbreak, using a wider set of epidemiologically unrelated clinical E. cloacae isolates for comparison. Forty-three isolates were analysed, including 23 E. cloacae and 3 Citrobacter sp. isolates obtained from blood cultures from 16 neonates over a 3 month period. These were compared with two contemporaneous community-associated drug-resistant isolates from adults, a unit <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> isolate {{and a set of}} historical invasive isolates (n= 14) from the same geographical locality. There were two clear neonatal outbreaks and one isolated case in the unit. One outbreak was associated with an NDM- 1 plasmid also identified in a historical community-associated strain. The smaller, second outbreak was likely associated with a contaminated <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser.</b> The two community-acquired adult cases and three sets of historical hospital-associated neonatal isolates represented four additional genetic clusters. E. cloacae infections in this context represent several different transmission networks, operating at the community/hospital and host strain/plasmid levels. Wide sampling frames and high-resolution typing methods are needed to describe the complex molecular epidemiology of E. cloacae outbreaks, which is not appropriately reflected by routine susceptibility phenotypes. <b>Soap</b> <b>dispensers</b> may represent a reservoir for E. cloacae and bacterial strains and plasmids may persist in hospitals and in the community for long periods, sporadically being involved in outbreaks of disease...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objective: Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{infection}} {{represents a}} {{main cause of}} morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients. This study describes a fatal epidemic of P. aeruginosa that occurred in a hematology unit in Italy. Methods: Retrospective cohort study, prospective surveillance, auditing, extensive testing on healthcare workers and environmental investigation were performed to define the dynamics and potential causes of transmission. RAPD, macrorestriction analyses and sequence typing were used to define relationships between P. aeruginosa isolates. Results: Eighteen cases of infection were identified in the different phases of the investigation. Of these, five constitute a significant molecular cluster of infection. A P. aeruginosa strain with the same genetic fingerprint and sequence type (ST 175) as clinical isolates strain was also isolated from a heavily contaminated triclosan <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser.</b> Discussion and Conclusions: Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that patients became indirectly infected, e. g., during central venous catheter handling through contaminated items, and that the triclosan <b>soap</b> <b>dispenser</b> acted as a common continuous source of P. aeruginosa infection. Since P. aeruginosa is intrinsically unsusceptible to triclosan, the use of triclosan-based disinfectant formulations should be avoided in those healthcare settings hosting patients at high risk of P. aeruginosa infection...|$|R
40|$|Black fungi {{reported}} as degraders of volatile aromatic compounds were isolated from hydrocarbon-polluted sites and indoor environments. Several {{of the species}} encountered are known opportunistic pathogens or {{are closely related to}} pathogenic species causing severe mycoses, among which are neurological infections in immunocompetent individuals. Given the scale of the problem of environmental pollution and the phylogenetic relation of aromate-degrading black fungi with pathogenic siblings, it is of great interest to select strains able to mineralize these substrates efficiently without any risk for public health. Fifty-six black strains were obtained from human-made environments rich in hydrocarbons (gasoline car tanks, washing machine <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers)</b> after enrichment with some phenolic intermediates of toluene and styrene fungal metabolism. Based on ITS sequencing identification, the majority of the obtained isolates were members of the genus Exophiala. Exophiala xenobiotica was found to be the dominant black yeast present in the car gasoline tanks. A higher biodiversity, with three Exophiala species, was found in <b>soap</b> <b>dispensers</b> of washing machines. Strains obtained were screened using a 2, 6 -dichlorophenol-indophenol (DCPIP) assay, optimized for black fungi, to assess their potential ability to degrade toluene.
