500|$|<b>A</b> multiple-vortex <b>tornado</b> is <b>a</b> type of <b>tornado</b> {{in which}} two or more columns of {{spinning}} air rotate about their own axis {{and at the same}} time around a common center. A multi-vortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path. This is a phenomenon that is distinct from <b>a</b> satellite <b>tornado,</b> which is <b>a</b> smaller <b>tornado</b> which forms very near <b>a</b> large, strong <b>tornado</b> contained within the same mesocyclone. The satellite tornado may appear to [...] "orbit" [...] the larger tornado (hence the name), giving the appearance of one, large multi-vortex <b>tornado.</b> However, <b>a</b> satellite <b>tornado</b> is <b>a</b> distinct circulation, and is much smaller than the main funnel.|$|R

5|$|Though tornadoes {{can strike}} in an instant, there are {{precautions}} and preventative measures {{that people can}} take to increase the chances of surviving <b>a</b> <b>tornado.</b> Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center advise having a pre-determined plan should <b>a</b> <b>tornado</b> warning be issued. When a warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have storm cellars on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives.|$|E

5|$|Bonnie {{triggered}} <b>a</b> <b>tornado</b> outbreak throughout {{portions of}} the Mid-Atlantic states. One tornado in Pender County, North Carolina destroyed 17homes and damaged 59houses, causing three deaths and $1.27million in damage (2004USD).

In South Carolina, tornadoes across the state damaged nine homes. A suspected tornado in Danville, Virginia destroyed the roofs of several businesses. In South Carolina, rainfall peaking at 6.07inches (154mm) in Loris caused flooding across the state. The flooding, including a one-foot depth along U.S. Route 501, washed away a road and a bridge in Greenville County. In addition, 600people across the state were left without electricity.|$|E
50|$|Typically in late April {{through early}} June, Comanche County {{is prone to}} severe weather which can include tornadoes. Notably in 1957, <b>a</b> F4 <b>tornado</b> and again in 1979 <b>a</b> F3 <b>tornado</b> struck the {{southern}} region of Lawton.|$|R

Five people were injured near Cardington, Ohio after <b>a</b> brief <b>tornado</b> damaged trees, utility lines, and a mobile home.|$|R

5|$|Current {{advice is}} that opening windows {{in advance of}} <b>a</b> <b>tornado</b> wastes time that could be spent seeking shelter. Also, being near windows is very {{dangerous}} during a severe weather event, possibly exposing people to flying glass.|$|E
5|$|July 22, 1970– Tropical Storm Becky hits Apachicola, {{producing}} moderate rainfall peaking at over 8inches (203mm) in Tallahassee which floods 104 {{houses and}} injures two. The storm also spawns <b>a</b> <b>tornado</b> which destroys {{a house and}} severely damages three others in Panacea.|$|E
50|$|Some {{thunderstorms}} can {{be extremely}} severe and tornadoes, although very rare, are possible. In September 1998, <b>a</b> small <b>tornado</b> hit Lynbrook; in August 1999, <b>an</b> F-2 <b>tornado</b> hit parts of Mattituck, in August 2005, <b>a</b> small <b>tornado</b> hit Glen Cove; one year later in August 2006, <b>a</b> small <b>tornado</b> hit Massapequa in Nassau County, and parts of Amityville, located in Suffolk County. On July 18, 2007, <b>an</b> F-1 <b>tornado</b> hit Islip Terrace and on September 27, 2006, a rare waterspout was seen over Long Island Sound near Port Jefferson. In the wintertime, temperatures are warmer than areas further inland (especially {{in the night and}} early morning hours), sometimes causing a snowstorm further inland to fall as rain or mixed precipitation on the island. In Late July 2008 off the coast of Quogue on Dune Road, a water spout formed in the ocean; the related severe thunderstorms were the worst reported in years.|$|R
5|$|Lawton {{is located}} {{squarely}} in the area known as Tornado Alley and is prone to severe weather from late April through early June. Most notably, <b>an</b> F4 <b>tornado</b> in 1957, and <b>an</b> F3 <b>tornado</b> in 1979 struck the southern region of the city.|$|R
50|$|Learning is the {{modification}} of behaviour by experience. For example, learning to avoid certain stimuli such as <b>a</b> <b>tornadoes,</b> thunderstorms, large animals, and toxic chemicals, {{because they can}} be harmful. This is classified as aversion conditioning, and is related to fear responses.|$|R
