5000|$|ASTM E 2395 is a Standard Specification for Voluntary Security Performance of Window <b>and</b> <b>Door</b> Assemblies with <b>and</b> without Glazing Impact. This {{standard}} {{was created by}} the American Standard for Testing and Materials (ASTM). ASTM International which was funded in 1898, is an international standards developing organization that develops and publishes standards {{for a wide range of}} materials, products, systems, and services.

5|$|St. Paul's Place: Off State Street between Fourth and Fifth avenues. This is {{a street}} of six {{attached}} three-story brick rowhouses built ca. 1850. They feature {{a variation on}} Italianate norms with bracketed gables and rounded-arch windows <b>and</b> <b>doors</b> rarely seen with that style in an urban environment.|$|E
5|$|Styles {{for these}} sandstone/mortar constructions, both surface and cliff dwellings, {{included}} T-shaped windows <b>and</b> <b>doors.</b> This {{has been taken}} by some archaeologists, including Stephen H. Lekson, {{as evidence of the}} continuing reach of the Chacoan system. Other researchers see these elements as part of a more generalized Puebloan style and/or spiritual significance, rather than evidence of a continuing specific elite socioeconomic system.|$|E

5|$|While these {{characteristics}} never occur all {{together in the}} same building, and none are unique to Sicilian Baroque, it is the coupling together which gives the Sicilian Baroque its distinctive air. Other Baroque characteristics, such as broken pediments over windows, the extravagant use of statuary, and curved topped windows <b>and</b> <b>doors</b> are all emblematic of Baroque architecture, but can all be found on Baroque building all over Europe.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, the {{elements}} {{characteristic of the}} style include: the ogival, redented towers shaped like lotus buds; half-galleries to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are devatas (or apsaras), bas-reliefs, and on pediments extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work. Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including gilded stucco on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels <b>and</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|E
5|$|At about 3:30 or 4:00 a.m., roughly {{five minutes}} after Engine Co. 22 evacuated, the {{building}} exploded. The explosion flattened six to eight buildings, blew in the fronts of the opposite houses on Broad Street, and wrenched shutters <b>and</b> <b>doors</b> from buildings at {{some distance from the}} immediate area. It propelled bricks and other missiles through the air, threw many people down who had gone as far as Beaver Street, and spread the fire far and wide so that the whole neighborhood was set ablaze. The explosion shattered windows a mile away and was heard as far away as Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|Aveni {{claims that}} another {{building}} {{associated with the}} planet Venus {{in the form of}} Kukulcan, and the rainy season at Chichen Itza is the Caracol. This is a building with circular tower <b>and</b> <b>doors</b> facing the cardinal directions. The base faces the most northerly setting of Venus. Additionally the pillars of a stylobate on the building's upper platform were painted black and red. These are colours associated with Venus as an evening and morning star. However the windows in the tower seem to have been little more than slots, making them poor at letting light in, but providing a suitable place to view out.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{has been}} used since ancient times as a durable, {{corrosion}} resistant, and weatherproof architectural material. Roofs, flashings, rain gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, <b>and</b> <b>doors</b> have been made from copper for {{hundreds or thousands of}} years. Copper's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding, building expansion joints, radio frequency shielding, and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops. Some of copper's other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal movement, light weight, lightning protection, and recyclability.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20thcentury the fishing fleet kept the harbour busy and few cargo boats used the port. It was revitalised {{as a result}} of a strike at Hull docks in 1955 when six ships were {{diverted}} and unloaded their cargoes on the fish quay. Endeavour Wharf, near the railway station, was opened in 1964 by the local council. The number of vessels using the port in 1972 was 291, increased from 64 in 1964. Timber, paper and chemicals are imported while exports include steel, furnace-bricks <b>and</b> <b>doors.</b> The port is owned and managed by Scarborough Borough Council since the Harbour Commissioners relinquished responsibility in 1905.|$|E

5|$|European {{visitors}} in 1667 reported the Sihanaka lived in fortified villages, which they very effectively defended with bows and arrows. They {{were the only}} ethnic group encountered by the European party that had built a bridge. Homes were made of plant material; the Sihanaka believed building homes in brick or clay would invite the displeasure of the ancestors. Gendered roles factored into house construction and maintenance: men applied carpentry to build {{the frame of the}} house and roof, as well as the windows <b>and</b> <b>doors</b> and their frames, while women wove zozoro reed mats that would serve as walls, flooring and roofing.|$|E
5|$|Roofers {{replaced}} Davison's roof in 1960 and {{new windows}} were installed in 1980. A new staircase {{on the side}} of the dorm facing away from the quad was built in 2005. The dorm underwent a major renovation during the 2008–2009 school year, reopening at the beginning of the 2009–2010 academic year. The renovation included plans for upgraded accessibility, including an elevator and disabled-accessible bathrooms <b>and</b> <b>doors,</b> making it Vassar's first dorm to offer those features.|$|E
5|$|The Ballroom, {{the last}} of the palace's three largest rooms, (illustrated below) was {{designed}} by Robillon in 1760. To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms. The ormolu Rococo ornament takes the form of heavy gilding to the walls and ceiling, of such richness that it has been compared with that of François de Cuvilliés' Amalienburg at Schloss Nymphenburg. The walls <b>and</b> <b>doors</b> are mirrored and the painted and gilded, coffered ceiling is supported by golden caryatids.|$|E

They can also swim and dive underwater. Robots attack the player with shooting flames should they come into contact. Each stage ends with a boss battle, ranging from fire-breathing flowers to robotic fish.|$|E
5|$|The large, maze-like mansion's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} with angles slightly askew, resulting in off-center perspectives <b>and</b> <b>doors</b> that {{open and close}} by themselves. The immense library contains the ramshackle spiral staircase from which the previous owner hanged herself; the vast conservatory is adorned with eerie statues. During their first night in the house, Eleanor and Theo are terrified by supernatural occurrences outside Theo's bedroom door. Deafening banging is heard against {{the door and the}} voice of a young girl is heard echoing with laughter. Despite the turbulence, Eleanor feels a tentative affinity to Hill House.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of infrastructure {{must also be}} considered within emergency preparedness. Critical facilities that need to remain operable should be identified, and all others should be shut down to reduce damage. It is also important to keep ash out of buildings, machinery and lifeline networks (in particular water and wastewater systems,) to prevent some of the damage caused by ash particles. Windows <b>and</b> <b>doors</b> should be closed and shuttered if possible, to prevent ingress of ash into buildings.|$|E
