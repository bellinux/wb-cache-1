[...] It was the federal government's claim that the Burt Lake Band had been granted the Indian Village area land by treaty and should not have been evicted for non-payment of property taxes. Burt Township, Cheboygan County and the State of Michigan had errored in assessing the federally recognized Burt Lake Band's Indian Village property. Added to that was the fact that at no time did the Governor of Michigan, whose name in perpetuity was on the six in question land deeds, receive notice of a property <b>tax</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>on</b> the <b>lands</b> (which all had been placed in trust to his office).

We assume that developed properties reduce open space, and thereby harm urban residents. However, ignoring this negative externality, landowners will develop properties sooner than is socially optimal. A regulator can correct this tendency by imposing a positive <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> development or a negative <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>land</b> value. Alternatively, the regulator can implement both instruments simultaneously, in which case {{an increase in the}} <b>tax</b> rate <b>on</b> development will be accompanied by an increase in the <b>tax</b> rate <b>on</b> <b>land</b> value, and vice versa...|$|R
