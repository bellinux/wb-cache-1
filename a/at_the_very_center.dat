40|$|The {{formation}} {{and evolution of}} Black Holes inevitably affects the distribution of dark and baryonic matter {{in the neighborhood of}} the Black Hole. These effects may be particularly relevant around Supermassive and Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs), the formation of which can lead to large Dark Matter overdensities, called spikes and mini-spikes respectively. Despite being larger and more dense, spikes evolve <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>centers</b> of galactic halos, in regions where numerous dynamical effects tend to destroy them. Mini-spikes {{may be more likely to}} survive, and they have been proposed as worthwhile targets for indirect Dark Matter searches. We review here the formation scenarios and the prospects for detection of mini-spikes, and we present new estimates for the abundances of mini-spikes to illustrate the sensitivity of such predictions to cosmological parameters and uncertainties regarding the astrophysics of Black Hole formation at high redshift. We also connect the IMBHs scenario to the recent measurements of cosmic-ray electron and positron spectra by the PAMELA, ATIC, H. E. S. S., and Fermi collaborations. Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures.

25|$|Because of the relics they contained, wooden pagodas {{used to be}} the {{centerpiece}} of the garan, the seven edifices considered indispensable for a temple. They gradually lost importance and were replaced by the kondō (golden hall), because of the magic powers believed to lie within the images the building housed. This loss of status was so complete that Zen schools, which arrived late in Japan from China, normally do not have any pagoda in their garan. The layout of four early temples clearly illustrates this trend: they are in chronological order Asuka-dera, Shitennō-ji, Hōryū-ji, and Yakushi-ji. In the first, the pagoda was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>center</b> of the garan surrounded by three small kondō (see the reconstruction of the temple's original layout). In the second, a single kondō {{is at the center of}} the temple and the pagoda lies in front of it. At Hōryū-ji, they are one next to the other. Yakushi-ji has a single, large kondō at the center with two pagodas on the sides. The same evolution can be observed in Buddhist temples in China.|$|E

With cosmological three dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations, we explore {{in detail the}} virialization of baryons in the concordance cosmology, including optically thin primordial gas cooling. We focus on early protogalaxies with virial temperatures of 10 ^ 4 K and their progenitors. Without cooling, virial heating occurs in shocks close to the virial radius for material falling in from voids. Material in dense filaments penetrates deeper to about half that radius. With cooling the virial shock position shrinks and also the filaments reach scales {{as small as a}} third the virial radius. The temperatures in protogalaxies found in adiabatic simulations decrease by a factor of two from the center and show flat entropy cores. In cooling halos the gas reaches virial equilibrium with the dark matter potential through its turbulent velocities. We observe turbulent Mach numbers ranging from one to three in the cooling cases. This turbulence is driven by the large scale merging and interestingly remains supersonic in the centers of these early galaxies {{even in the absence of}} any feedback processes. The virial theorem is shown to approximately hold over 3 orders of magnitude in length scale with the turbulent pressure prevailing over the thermal energy. The turbulent velocity distributions are Maxwellian and by far dominate the small rotation velocities associated with the total angular momentum of the galaxies.

Using photoactivation and photobleaching, we measure mitotic motor movement inside a dynamic spindle.

This transport occurs throughout <b>the</b> spindle except <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> spindle <b>center</b> and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spindle poles, where Eg 5 remains stationary.

40|$|Abstract. Using {{a set of}} ROSAT HRI deep pointings, we {{investigate}} the presence of small-scale structures in the central regions of clusters of galaxies. Our sample comprises 23 objects up to z = 0. 32, 13 of them known to host a cooling flow. Structures are detected and characterized using a wavelet analysis, their statistical significance being assessed by a rigorous treatment of photon noise. For all clusters, we present multiresolution filtered images, restoring structures on all scales and allowing the suppression of noise. We then investigate in detail the geometrical properties of the smallest scale structures. Contrary to previous claims, we find very few “filaments ” or pointlike features at a 3. 7 σ level, except <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> cluster <b>centers.</b> Complex cores are conspicuous {{in at least three}} massive cooling flows located at z = 0. 22 − 0. 26. From our initial data set we have simulated a redshifted sample, and analyzed it in the same way in order to investigate any instrumental/resolution effect on the detectability of structures. On the one hand, the topology of the core down to the limiting resolution appears to be, at least in our redshift range, indistinguishable between low and high z clusters. On the other hand, external parts seem to be more affected in distant clusters, as indicated by the study of the “centroid shift ” or position angle variation as a function of radius. Peculiar central features and strong isophotal twisting are found in some distant massive cooling flow clusters. All this suggests that X-ray cores which extend to a region comparable to the cD envelope should be rather isolated {{from the rest of the}} cluster and are probably undergoing peculiar physical processes- like ISM/ICM connections- competing with relaxation...|$|R

We present high resolution (4 "x 3 "~ 0. 16 x 0. 11 pc) interferometric observations of CN, 13 CN, H 2 CO, SiO, c-C 3 H 2 and HC 3 N emission at 1. 3 mm towards the central ~ 4 pc of the Galactic center region. Strong differences are observed in the distribution of the different molecules. The UV resistant species CN, the only species tracing all previously identified circumnuclear disk (CND) structures, is mostly concentrated in optically thick clumps in the rotating filaments around Sgr A*. H 2 CO emission traces a shell-like structure that we interpret as the expansion of Sgr A East against the 50 km/s and 20 km/s giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We derive isotopic ratios 12 C/ 13 C~ 15 - 45 across most of the CND region. The densest molecular material, traced by SiO and HC 3 N, is located in the southern CND. The observed c-C 3 H 2 /HC 3 N ratio observed in the region is more than an order of magnitude lower than in Galactic PDRs. Toward the central region only CN was detected in absorption. Apart from the known narrow line-of-sight absorptions, a 90 km/s wide optically thick spectral feature is observed. We find evidences of an even wider (> 100 km/s) absorption feature. Around 70 - 75 % of the gas mass, concentrated in just the 27 % densest molecular clumps, is associated with rotating structures and show evidences of association with each of the arcs of ionized gas in the mini-spiral structure.
