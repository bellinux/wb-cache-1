5|$|Strongly {{affected}} by the deindustrialization {{that took place in}} other Rust Belt cities, Utica suffered a major reduction in manufacturing <b>activity</b> <b>during</b> {{the second half of the}} 20thcentury. The 1954 opening of the New York State Thruway (which bypassed the city) and declines in activity on the Erie Canal and railroads throughout the United States also contributed to a poor local economy. During the 1980s and 1990s, major employers such as General Electric and Lockheed Martin began to close plants in Utica and Syracuse.|$|E

5|$|A Dainty Politician is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on corruption political <b>activity</b> <b>during</b> a political convention in which a corrupt politician is running for re-election to the United States Congress. The votes are tallied and the challenger ties with the corrupt Congressman Casey, but a third candidate holds the balance of power. Casey bribes the third candidate to retire in his favor, but the plot is uncovered and the two are ejected from the convention by a reporter {{who falls in love}} with challenger's daughter. The film was released on August 23, 1910, and saw a wide national release. Little is known of the actual production, but it received mixed reaction for the plausibility of its plot. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|A barrier jet in the {{low levels}} forms just {{upstream}} of mountain chains, with the mountains forcing the jet to be oriented parallel to the mountains. The mountain barrier increases {{the strength of the}} low level wind by 45 percent. In the North American Great Plains a southerly low-level jet helps fuel overnight thunderstorm <b>activity</b> <b>during</b> the warm season, normally in the form of mesoscale convective systems which form during the overnight hours. A similar phenomenon develops across Australia, which pulls moisture poleward from the Coral Sea towards cut-off lows which form mainly across southwestern portions of the continent.|$|E
5|$|Animals may avoid {{becoming}} prey {{by living}} {{out of sight of}} predators, whether in caves, underground, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by <b>activity</b> <b>during</b> the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} dwarf sphaeros, {{little is known}} about the ecology and {{behaviour}} of the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero. Because of its high surface-area-to-volume ratio that results from its diminutive size, the species was thought to be susceptible to water loss, so it has been studied to understand how it survives in its semi-arid habitat. Unlike desert-dwelling lizards, the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero lacks special adaptations to prevent desiccation and loses water at a rate similar to that of lizards from mesic habitats. From size differences alone, it loses water 70% faster than the larger and sympatric big-scaled least gecko. It survives instead by inhabiting humid microhabitats in its dry environment, by adjusting its reproductive cycle so that hatchlings emerge during the time of year with the highest precipitation, and by reducing <b>activity</b> <b>during</b> the driest parts of the day.|$|E
5|$|Eruptions from Mount Cleveland are {{generally}} vulcanian and strombolian in nature, characterized by short explosive ash clouds sometimes accompanied by a'a flows, lava fountains, pyroclastic flows, ash and steam emissions, lava dome growth, and the ejection of breadcrust bombs. Hot springs were reportedly {{found on the}} volcano in the 1800s, and persistent fumarolic activity was observed in the 1980s and 1990s. Mount Cleveland is a site of persistent steam emissions and thermal anomalies that represent constant background <b>activity.</b> <b>During</b> 2011, a summit lava dome formed, by continuous intrusion of magma at the summit. Late in 2011, nearly 6 explosions demolished the dome. In June 2012, another small dome was observed.|$|E
5|$|Feth-i BÃ¼lend saw action {{during the}} Russo-Turkish War of 1877â€“1878, where she battled the Russian steamer Vesta in an {{inconclusive}} engagement. The Ottoman fleet was laid up {{for most of}} the next twenty years, and Feth-i BÃ¼lend saw no <b>activity</b> <b>during</b> this period. Modernized in 1890, she was nevertheless still not in condition for active service at the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897. She was therefore heavily rebuilt in Germany between 1903 and 1907. At the start of the First Balkan War in 1912, the ship was stationed in Thessaloniki; the ship was disarmed so the guns could be used to strengthen the port's fortifications. On the night of 31 October, a Greek torpedo boat slipped into the harbor and sank Feth-i BÃ¼lend, killing seven of her crew.|$|E
