40|$|The {{conventional}} wisdom in American politics {{has long been}} that {{someone who is not}} religious cannot be elected president of the United States.

And a new Pew Research Center survey finds that being an atheist remains one of the biggest liabilities that a presidential candidate can have; fully half of <b>American</b> adults <b>say</b> <b>they</b> would be less likely to vote for a hypothetical presidential candidate who does not believe in God, while just 6 % <b>say</b> <b>they</b> would be more likely to vote for a nonbeliever. On the other hand, the share of <b>American</b> adults who <b>say</b> <b>they</b> would be less likely to vote for an atheist candidate has been declining over time. Moreover, one of the candidates who is widely viewed by Republicans as a potentially "good" or "great" president, Donald Trump, is not widely viewed as a religious person, even by those in his own party. And on the Democratic side, the share of <b>Americans</b> who <b>say</b> Hillary Clinton is not a religious person now stands at 43 %, which is sharply higher than it was in the summer of 2007, when she was seeking the presidential nomination for the first time. These are among the key findings of a new Pew Research Center survey conducted Jan. 7 - 14, 2016, on landlines and cellphones among a national sample of 2, 009 adults. This is the latest in a long line of research the Center has conducted on the role of religion in presidential campaigns...|$|R
