An inversion procedure for obtaining the multi-linear cohesive stress {{response from the}} flexural load response of a beam is presented. The procedure is applied to obtain the σ-w relationship for macro-synthetic fiber reinforced concrete. An experimental investigation of the crack propagation in flexural response of macro-synthetic fiber reinforced concrete is presented using the digital image correlation technique. The post-cracking response of macro-synthetic fiber reinforced concrete during the <b>initial</b> <b>softening</b> and the subsequent load recovery is experimentally shown {{to be associated with}} a hinge type behaviour and is produced by crack closing stresses contributed by fibers. From the optical measurements the hinge length is identified with a zone of length equal to twice the aggregate size. Using the measured hinge length, the multi-linear σ-w relationship for macro-synthetic fiber reinforced concrete obtained by matching the experimental and analytical load responses exhibits stress recovery following <b>initial</b> <b>softening.</b> The cohesive stress decreases following the recovery at large crack separation. The crack closing stresses contributed by the pullout of fibers contribute to stress recovery in the σ-w relationship and are primarily active after the formation of the hinge resulting in significant contribution to fracture energy. There is a good correlation in the fracture energy obtained from load response and the σ-w relationship at different values of crack opening displacements...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of harvest date and fruit size {{on the three}} phases of softening for Royal Gala and Cox's Orange Pippin apple cultivars is currently not known. During storage at 0. 5 or 3 degreesC, late-harvested fruit had a shorter <b>initial</b> slow <b>softening</b> phase and required less time before the internal ethylene concentration exceeded 1. 5 mul(- 1) than fruit harvested earlier. Rate of rapid phase softening was similar for fruit from each harvest date. Unlike harvest date, fruit size did not consistently affect the harvest indices of fruit from either cultivar. Once in storage at 0. 5 or 3 degreesC the softening profiles of different sized fruit from early harvests were similar. However, small fruit softened more slowly than medium and large fruit when harvested at a late stage of maturity.

For comparison purposes we also analyse deformations of a pure W and an Fe–Ni–W rod. It is found that shear bands, defined as narrow regions of rapid intense plastic deformation, form near the transition between the mush-roomed region and the relatively undeformed portion of the rod, when its material is either a mixture of Fe–Ni–W and W particles or a homogeneous alloy but no such bands form in rods made of either W or Fe–Ni–W only.

40|$|The dog kidney {{epithelial}} cell line (MDCK) {{has been shown}} to exhibit a density-correlated inhibition of growth at approxmately 6. 6 X 10 (5) cells per cm 2. When a confluent monolayer at its maximal density was wounded by removal of a wide swath of cells, migration of the cell sheet into the denuded area occurred. Precise measurements of the rate of migration for 5 day showed that the cells accelerated at a uniform rate of 0. 24 micrometer. hr- 2 and, by extrapolation, possessed an <b>apparent</b> <b>initial</b> velocity of 2. 8 micrometer. hr- 1 at the time of wounding. The <b>apparent</b> <b>initial</b> velocity was considered {{to be the result of}} a brief (< 10 hr) and rapid acceleration dependent on cell density. To verify this, wounds were made at different densities below the maximum. In these experiments, the cells did not migrate until a "threshold" density of 2. 0 X 10 (5) cells per cm 2 was reached regardless of the density at the time of wounding. At the threshold density, the cell sheet began to accelerate at the previously measured rate (0. 24 micrometer. hr- 2). Any increase in density by cell division was balanced by cell migration, so that the same threshold density was maintained by the migrating cells.

40|$|The {{curves of}} growth and of {{regeneration}} follow the same course, and can be represented by the same exponential equation. This is taken to substantiate the theory that growth and regeneration are essentially identical processes governed by the same laws. A common peculiarity of the curves {{of growth and}} of regeneration is that during a short period {{in the early stages}} of regeneration and of growth, the apparent observed speed of these processes seems to be relatively slow. As a result, the curve of the fitted equation cuts the time axis not at zero, the beginning of growth or regeneration, but somewhat later. Data on regeneration are cited indicating that the initial slow phase of regeneration is due to the time required for the formation of a cap of embryonic cells which serves as a basis for the more active later regeneration; in other words, to qualitative growth which cannot be expressed in terms of quantitative units. It is suggested that the <b>apparent</b> <b>initial</b> slow phase of growth of the individual from the fertilized egg is due to a similar qualitative growth. It is suggested that if the initial qualitative changes could be converted into some common unit with the subsequent quantitative changes, the <b>apparent</b> <b>initial</b> lag would disappear, and the exponential equation representing the course of these processes would then be the same as the equation used to represent the course of a monomolecular chemical reaction.
