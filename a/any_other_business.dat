25|$|The Speaker must {{be elected}} when Parliament first meets after any general election, before it {{proceeds}} {{to deal with}} <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>business.</b> Similarly, whenever the office of Speaker is vacant for some reason other than a dissolution of Parliament, no business must be transacted other than {{the election of a}} person to fill that office. The Speaker may be elected from among the MPs who are not Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries, but even a person who is not an MP can be chosen. Nonetheless, a candidate who is not an MP must possess the qualifications to stand for election as an MP. The Speaker's salary may not be reduced while he is in office.|$|E
25|$|Several {{family members}} of those killed, along with {{survivors}} of the massacre, filed lawsuits against the McDonald's Corporation and the local franchisee in the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego. The court eventually consolidated these lawsuits and then dismissed them before trial on a defense motion for summary judgment; the plaintiffs appealed. On July 25, 1987, the California Court of Appeal affirmed summary judgment for the defendants because (1) McDonald's or <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>business</b> has no duty of care to protect patrons from an unforeseeable assault by a murderous madman; and (2) plaintiffs could not prove causation because the standard reasonable measures normally used by restaurants to deter criminals, such as guards and closed-circuit television cameras, {{could not possibly have}} deterred the perpetrator, because he did not care about his own survival.|$|E

500|$|McCartney's {{refusal to}} have the release of his eponymous first solo album delayed {{to allow for the}} Beatles' Let It Be album led to the band's {{break-up}} on 9 April 1970. Late that month, Harrison visited Apple's new offices at 1700 Broadway, New York, where he announced his intention to begin working with American producer Phil Spector on an album of his unused songs, some of which he had been stockpiling for up to four years. Noting the emotional disarray of Lennon, McCartney and Starr at this point, Doggett writes of their former bandmate: [...] "Harrison retained a sense of objectivity. The youngest Beatle, he was now the group's wisest spokesman." [...] In an interview for New York's WPLJ Radio, Harrison remarked of McCartney's objections to Klein running Apple: [...] "The reality is that he's outvoted, and we're a partnership... ike in <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>business</b> or group, you have a vote, and he was outvoted three to one..." ...|$|E
500|$|Burnet {{chose to}} take an {{extremely}} hard line {{on the subject of}} the salary: he refused to conduct <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>business,</b> or to dissolve the legislature, until the salary was decided. The legislature in turn refused to enact a salary bill, although it offered generous one-time grants that Burnet refused on principle. [...] He further raised tensions by implicitly suggesting that the assembly's failure to act on the salary might jeopardize the colonial charter. [...] In order to make life as difficult as possible for the legislators, Burnet relocated the assembly from Boston first to Salem and then Cambridge, increasing the costs of the legislators and forcing many of them from the comforts of their Boston-area properties. [...] In November 1728 the assembly voted to send agents to London to argue their side of the issue with the Board of Trade. [...] Its attempts to appropriate funds for the agents were denied by the governor's council, and the agents ended up being paid from funds raised by subscription.|$|E

2500|$|In the Netherlands, {{cannabis}} {{and other}} [...] "soft" [...] drugs are partly decriminalised in small quantities.

Contrary to popular belief, cannabis is still illegal, mostly to satisfy the country's agreements with the United Nations. Coffee shops that sell cannabis to people 18 or above are tolerated in some cities, and pay taxes like <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>business</b> for their cannabis and hashish sales, although distribution is a grey area that the authorities would rather not go into as it is not decriminalised. Many [...] "coffee shops" [...] are found in Amsterdam and cater mainly to the large tourist trade; the local consumption rate is far lower than in the US.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to assess the effects of agglomeration on technical efficiency of French pig farms. We use a two-stage method to evaluate the effects of agglomeration on technical efficiency. The first stage consists in calculating pig activity’s efficiency scores with the non-parametric method Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The second stage is a truncated regression of these scores on agglomeration variables. Data are for 899 French pig producers in 2004. Results suggest that these farms were as much affected by positive agglomeration externalities (that are knowledge spillovers due to farms’ density, and also arise from farms’ closeness to downstream market) as <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>businesses.</b> There was however no evidence of negative externalities {{in the form of}} constraints in farmers’ land demand due to legal disposition relating to manure spreading.
