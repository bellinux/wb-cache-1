50|$|Leptospira noguchii is a {{chemoorganotrophic}} organism. The metabolism of L. noguchii {{is unusual}} {{due to the}} fact that the main source of energy and carbon comes from beta-oxidation of long-chained fatty acids. An interesting fact about Leptospira noguchii is that it the ability to process glucose; however, this is not its preferred way to obtain energy, though it has the necessary enzymes to perform this process. This organism is also able to use the respiratory electron transport chain due to being an <b>aerobic</b> <b>organism</b> that can also survive in microaerophilic environments.

5000|$|Congregibacter litoralis KT71 is an aerobic anoxygenic {{photoheterotroph}} (AAnPs). In general terms, {{this means}} that KT71 is a strict <b>aerobic</b> <b>organism</b> with preference for low-oxygen environments. To find these environments, KT71 uses a flagellum combined with chemotaxis to move towards low-oxygen areas. [...] Though it does contain a complete photosynthesis superoperon, KT71 cannot grow autotrophically. [...] Instead, KT71 uses light for light-dependent cyclic electron transport through its photosystem to generate a proton gradient. [...] To determine the metabolism of KT71, the organism was grown in mineral medium containing: 35.0 g of sea salts, 0.1 g of NH4Cl, 0.05 g of K2HPO4, and 10 ml of a vitamin solution. The mineral medium was then supplemented with various carbon compounds to determine the ability for KT71 to use in its metabolism. From this {{it was determined that}} KT71 can grow well with carbon sources such as glutamate, pyruvate, and fatty acids as well as more complex substrates like yeast extract and trypticase peptone. Within its genome, genes, determined from genome annotation, involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, trichloroacetic acid cycle (TCA), citric acid cycle were found which correlated to the metabolism observed in culture. Further, KT71 is unable to use glucose as a sole carbon source, which was supported by genome analysis that showed a lack of glucose metabolism genes. Although the supplementation of inorganic sulfur to media did not promote growth, KT71 does contain sulfur-oxidizing (sox) genes that are uniquely arranged in its genome. [...] It is predicted that the potential use of the sox genes would be in the adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS)/ 3'-Phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) pathway.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to focus {{attention}} on the physiology of the bdellovibrio-host interaction and to determine the metabolic requirements for this reaction.

40|$|Background Although {{effective}} {{strategies have}} been presented for preventing the spread of antibiotic resistance in Iran, recent reports have revealed increasing antibiotic resistance among children and adults. Objectives In the present study, we tried to provide {{a clear view of}} the antibiotic resistance status of <b>aerobic</b> <b>organism</b> as the most prevalent organism in patients with rhinosinusitis in Hamadan, Iran. Patients and Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 216 consecutive patients referred to otolaryngology clinics of Imam Khomeini and Besat University hospitals in Hamadan with clinical and radiological manifestations of chronic rhinosinusitis. Two specimens were taken from each patient; one from the affected maxillary sinus by aspiration and another from the middle meatus and nasopharynx by swabbing. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by Kirby Bauer’s method; distributions of the isolates from middle meatus, nasopharynx and sinus were determined and the results of susceptibility test were analyzed. Results Among the <b>aerobic</b> <b>organism</b> from meatus and oropharynx, the most frequent isolated strains were alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (15. 4 %), followed by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (14. 6 %), and Branhamella catarrhalis (13. 2 %), and the most prevalent isolated strains from sinus were S. aureus (19. 1 %), Klebsiella pneumonia (16. 4 %), and B. catarrhalis (15. 6 %), respectively. The highest antibiotic susceptibility was detected to ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone in most of the strains; susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 76. 7 % (for Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to 100 % (for Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenza); susceptibility to ceftriaxone ranged from 71. 4 % (for Acinetobacter baumannii) to 100 % (for S. pneumonia, Corynebacterium diphtheria, and H. influenza). Besides, regardless of strain, the highest resistance was mostly detected to penicillin (ranging from 33. 3 % to 91. 7 %), and to ampicillin (ranging from 38. 4 % to 83. 7 %). Conclusions Our study showed that resistance to some antimicrobial agents including penicillin subgroups was considerably high for managing sinusitis. Therefore, public health policies should be more focused on minimizing the misuse of these subgroups as well as limiting the inappropriate use of other agents with high susceptibility...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: microbiologic {{data are}} lacking {{regarding}} pediatric community-acquired peritonitis (CAP). METHODS: {{we conducted a}} 2 -year retrospective single center study. Consecutive children undergoing CAP surgery were included. Microbiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of peritoneal isolates were analyzed. RESULTS: a total of 70 children from 3 months to 14 years of age were included. A total of 123 bacterial isolates were analyzed. Escherichia coli was the predominant <b>aerobic</b> <b>organism</b> (51 % of isolates); 54. 8 % were susceptible to amoxicillin whereas 90. 3 % were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa was present in 6 % of isolates and in 10 % of children. The presence of E. coli resistant to amoxicillin or to amoxicillin-clavulanate was the only independent risk factor associated with postoperative peritonitis.
