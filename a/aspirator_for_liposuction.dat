40|$|The {{origin of}} liposuction {{can be traced}} to an adverse event by Dujarrier in 1921 when he used a uterine curette to remove fat from the knees of a {{ballerina}} ending in an amputation secondary to damage of the femoral artery. The history of liposuction since then has been one of avoiding complications and optimising outcome. After this adverse event, liposuction was abandoned until the 1960 ′s when Schrudde revived the practice using small stab incisions and sharp curettage with the secondary suction to aspirate the freed tissue. This technique was associated with a high incidence of complications especially seroma and skin necrosis. Illouz then replaced the curette with a blunt cannula connected to vacuum pump thus avoiding the complications of a sharp curette.

Safety and aesthetic issues define MegaLiposuction {{to be in}} Volume in litres of more than 10 % of Body weight in Kgs. 870 cases of liposuction were performed between September 2000 and August 2008. In (65 %) cases, the total volume of aspirate was greater then 5 liters. (Range: 5 to 25 liters). In 24 % cases, the large volume liposuction was combined with a limited or a total block lipectomy. Regional anaesthesia with conscious sedation was preferred except where <b>liposuction</b> was <b>for</b> above the subcostal region (the Upper Trunk, Lateral Chest, Back, Gynaecomastia, Breast, Arms and Face) or when the patient so desired. Tumescent infiltration with Lactated ringer, adrenalin, triamcinalone and hyalase was made in all cases. This approach has clinically shown less tissue edema in the post operative period than when the conventional physiological saline was being used in place of Ringer Lactate. The amount injected varied from 1, 000 ml to 12, 500 ml depending on the size, site and area. Local anesthetic was included only to the terminal portion of the tumescent mixture while infiltrating the sub-costal regions, or when above costal region was combined with below costal region being anaesthetized with Spinal Anaesthesia. The aspirate was restricted to the unstained white / yellow fat {{and the amount of}} fat aspirated did not have any bearing to the amount of solution infiltrated. There was no major complication. Blood transfusion was given only on one occasion when the patient had been on aspirin and had also received Low Molecular weight Heparin intra-operative.

In the last three years the Authors had safely and successfully utilised breast suction in association with open breast reductìon. An evolution of practice slowly widened their indicatìons <b>for</b> <b>liposuction</b> and it became the sole modality for breast reductìon in some patients with predominantly fatty breasts. Scattered reports of reductìons of the female breast, only if moderately enlarged, using liposuction alone have appeared in the literature. The tumescent technique is a method of large volume subcutaneous infiltration of a dilute formula described by Klein <b>for</b> <b>liposuction.</b> Tumescence facilitates fat removal in a bloodless fashion and provides post operative pain relief. A logicai progression was to explore its application in breast surgery to safely perform even larger reductìons. Breast reductìon with liposuction only using the tumescent technique was performed in 15 patients (28 breasts) ranging in ages from 70 to 17 years {{with a mean age of}} 29. 2 years, with preoperative bra size from 34 E to 42 E. At the end of the procedure an average of 674 mi of Mds were collected in the botile, ranging from 1300 mi to 200 mi.

40|$|Liposuction {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{treatment}} modalities in aesthetic surgery with certain unique anaesthetic considerations. Liposuction is often performed as an office procedure. There are four main types of liposuction techniques based on the volume of infiltration or wetting solution injected, viz dry, wet, superwet, and tumescent technique. The tumescent technique {{is one of the}} most common liposuction techniques in which large volumes of dilute local anaesthetic (wetting solution) are injected into the fat to facilitate anaesthesia and decrease blood loss. The amount of lignocaine injected may be very large, approximately 35 - 55 mg/kg, raising concerns regarding local anaesthetic toxicity. Liposuction can be of two types according to the volume of solution aspirated: High volume (> 4, 000 ml aspirated) or low volume (< 4, 000 ml aspirated). While small volume liposuction may be done under local/monitored anaesthesia care, large-volume liposuction requires general anaesthesia. As a large volume of wetting solution is injected into the subcutaneous tissue, the intraoperative fluid management has to be carefully titrated along with haemodynamic monitoring and temperature control. Assessment of blood loss is difficult, as it is mixed with the aspirated fat. Since most obese patients opt <b>for</b> <b>liposuction</b> as a quick method to lose weight, all concerns related to obesity need to be addressed in a preoperative evaluation...|$|R
50|$|Though {{there is}} {{debate about the}} merits of {{surgical}} intervention, there are surgeons in USA, Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K. achieving success with lymphatic-sparing gentle water-jet-assisted liposuction (WAL). This is different from conventional liposuction, and is usually performed with tumescent local anesthesia; one of its merits is that WAL liposuction preserves {{the integrity of the}} lymphatic system while removing lipedematous adipose tissue.The only proven method to address the characteristic disproportionate fat of lipedema is lymph sparing tumescent liposuction. Most of literature on the effectiveness of these tumescent liposuction treatment are from England, Netherlands and Germany. The studies of highest quality involve tumescent or super tumescent anesthesia and vibrating liposuction, powered, cannula used with lymph sparing techniques. Although liposuction is not curative it can improve mobility, improve functionality of daily living, reduce or relieve pain, improve quality of life. The longest follow up on series of patients after tumescent liposuction with vibrating cannulas and lymph sparing techniques is 15 years and no reported reaccumulation of disproportionate fat in the treated areas. The treatment of lipedema with tumescent liposuction requires multiple procedures. In the United States Health Insurance, including medicare and medicaid do not generally pay <b>for</b> <b>liposuction</b> <b>for</b> lipedema, so multiple procedures can be expensive or cost prohibitive.

There is not much literature addressing the subject matter of pre- and post-surgery blood parameters, although this information is rather interesting. Documentation on patients who received laser-assisted liposuction treatment is particularly scarce. Until now, there has been no literature showing values of platelets, lymphocytes, and neutrophils after liposuction. Purpose: The aim of the work is to analyze and interpret values of platelets, lymphocytes and neutrophils in patient blood before and after liposuction, a surgery in which an extraordinarily large amount of potent drugs are used. Moreover, the aim is to compare values changes in patients of conventional and laser-assisted liposuction. Material and methods: We evaluated standard blood samples in patients prior to and after liposuction. This paper covers the number of platelets, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. A total of 54 patients were examined. Moreover, we compared the change in postoperative values in laser-assisted liposuction patients with the change of values in conventional liposuction patients. A paired two-sided Student&# 39;s t-test was used for statistical evaluation. P < 0. 005 was acknowledged to be statistically significant. Results: Values of platelets were raised both in conventional and in laser-assisted liposuction patients, but this difference was statistically non-significant and levels of platelets were still normal and within the range of blood levels in healthy patients. Values of neutrophils rose by up to 79. 49 % ± 7. 74 % standard deviation (SD) and values of lymphocytes dropped by up to 12. 68 % ± 5. 61 % SD. The before/after variances of conventional tumescent local anesthesia liposuction and variations in laser-assisted <b>liposuction</b> were similar <b>for</b> all measured parameters; they also showed no statistically significant differences between before and after surgery. The mean value of total operation time without laser-assistance was 3 hours 42 minutes (± 57 minutes SD, range 2 hours 50 minutes to 5 hours 10 minutes). Surgeries with laser-assistance were on average 16 minutes shorter with a mean duration of 3 hours 26 minutes (± 45 minutes SD, range 2 hours 40 minutes to 4 hours 10 minutes). The difference was not statistically significant (P < 0. 06). The mean value of aspirate volume <b>for</b> <b>liposuctions</b> performed without laser support was 2, 618 mL (± 633. 7 SD, range 700 mL to 3, 500 mL). Mean aspirate volume <b>for</b> <b>liposuctions</b> with laser assistance was increased by up to 61 mL (2, 677 mL ± 499. 5 SD, range 1, 800 mL to 3, 500 mL). The difference was not statistically significant (P < 0. 71). Conclusion: We conclude that conventional liposuction and laser-assisted liposuction have a similar influence on platelets, lymphocytes, and neutrophils in patients. Moreover, laser-assisted liposuction seems to be less time consuming than conventional liposuction. Keywords: liposuction, laser, platelets, lymphocytes, neutrophils, lipolysi...|$|R

40|$|Liposuction is {{a widely}} used {{technique}} today and indications are that it is becoming even more popular due to new technical refinements. The use of cannulae with a smaller diameter allows suction of the fat immediately under the dermis. The cannula we use to perform this new kind of fat suction is straight and has an external diameter of less than 2 mm. This cannula, the so-called Mercedes cannula, has a bullet tip and a three-hole head. Moreover, the holes are not round but are slit-shaped and oriented in the same plane at 120 degrees. This cannula is specifically designed to produce less trauma. The cannula with one downward-facing orifice is not suitable for suction of the subdermal layer and an upward-facing orifice would be too traumatic. The advantage of this new technique, apart from the possibility of treating patients with very slight adiposity, is to allow an effective skin retraction. When {{a large amount of}} fat has already been aspirated, residual deformities can occur. These skin irregularities represent the lack of an effective cutaneous retraction mostly due to the permanence of the subdermal fat. In fact, the presence of a thick subdermal adipose layer decreases the possibility of skin retraction. Therefore, indications <b>for</b> <b>liposuction</b> of the subdermal fat are mainly the slight adiposities and the remnant deformities of a previous liposuction operation. Moreover, this technique is applied to every lipoplasty whenever better skin retraction is needed...|$|R
40|$|Tumescent {{anaesthesia}} {{describes the}} practice of injecting a very dilute solution of local anaesthetic combined with epinephrine and sodium bicarbonate into tissue until it becomes firm and tense (tumescent). It was initially described {{in the field of}} liposuction but now surgical applications for the technique are widely varied ranging across vascular surgery, breast surgery, plastic surgery and ENT procedures. It is widely used in both hospital- and office-based environments and may form the sole method of anaesthesia for surgery. Advantages include a reduction in blood loss through both epinephrine-induced vasoconstriction as well as hydrostatic compression from the tumescent effect. Sodium bicarbonate reduces pain associated with the injection of an acidic local anaesthetic solution. Due to the unique pharmacokinetic profile of this technique lidocaine doses of 35  mg/kg bodyweight {{have been shown to be}} safe <b>for</b> <b>liposuction</b> procedures. Tumescent lidocaine is absorbed very slowly from subcutaneous tissues producing lower, and more delayed, peak blood levels compared to other routes, as well as extended postoperative analgesia. Slow systemic absorption allows the rapid hepatic plasma clearance of lidocaine to maintain safe local anaesthetic blood levels. This slow absorption from subcutaneous tissue has been likened to a depot injection. Careful attention must be given to appropriate local anaesthetic dosage alterations in cases of co-administration with agents affecting hepatic drug clearance or conditions reducing liver blood supply. Adherence to these pharmacological principles has produced an exemplary safety record for this technique to date...|$|R

40|$|Background: Liposuction is the commonest {{aesthetic}} procedure {{performed by}} Indian plastic surgeons. However, there exists substantial disparity amongst Indian surgeons about guidelines concerning liposuction. To address this disparity, a nationwide email survey (Association of Plastic Surgeons of India [APSI] database) {{was started in}} December 2013 and continued for 5 months. Material and Methods: The survey was developed with software from www. fluidsurveys. com. The {{study was designed to}} cover most aspects of patient selection, perioperative management, technical considerations, postoperative management and complications. This is the first survey to be conducted in India for an extremely popular procedure. It {{is also one of the}} most exhaustive surveys that have been conducted in terms of the topics covered. Results and Conclusions: One hundred and eighteen surgeons (including a majority of the cosmetic surgery stalwarts in the country) completed the survey. As expected, the results show a disparity in most parameters but also consolidation on some issues. Liposuction is considered extremely safe (86. 1 %). The majority of surgeons (70. 3 %) aspirated > 5 L at onetime. The majority (80. 2 %) felt that the limits <b>for</b> <b>liposuction</b> should be relative and not absolute. The survey highlights lack of standardization with respect to infiltration solutions. The commonest complications observed were contour irregularities, followed by seroma and inadequate skin redrape. The amount of aspirate is the only factor, which achieves statistical significance with respect to major complications. A review of the current evidence and recommendations has been incorporated, along with an in depth analysis of the survey...|$|R
