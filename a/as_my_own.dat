25|$|These {{principles}} of reason, cause and substance, given thus psychologically, {{enable us to}} pass {{beyond the limits of}} the relative and subjective to objective and absolute reality, they enable us, in a word, to pass from psychology, or the science of knowledge, to ontology or the science of being. These laws are inextricably mixed in consciousness with the data of volition and sensation, with free activity and fatal action or impression, and they guide us in rising to a personal being, a self or free cause, and to an impersonal reality, a not-me—nature, the world of force—lying out of us, and modifying us. As I refer to myself the act of attention and volition, so I cannot but refer the sensation to some cause, necessarily other than myself, that is, to an external cause, whose existence is as certain for me <b>as</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> existence, since the phenomenon which suggests it to me is as certain as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality, and both are given in each other. I thus reach an objective impersonal world of forces which corresponds to the variety of my sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each other is the order of the universe.|$|E
500|$|Historian Barbara Tuchman {{considered}} [...] "the {{single most}} formative experience" [...] {{of her career}} the writing of her undergraduate thesis, for which she was [...] "allowed to have <b>as</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> {{one of those little}} cubicles with a table under a window" [...] in the Widener stacks, which were [...] "my Archimedes' bathtub, my burning bush, my dish of mold where I found my personal penicillin." ...|$|E

500|$|After Charles's death, Lucinda Dalton {{applied to}} cancel her temple sealing to Charles in 1884: [...] "though I {{know he had}} many imperfections... now the brethren say he is unworthy, (though I know not who {{appointed}} them to judge him,) they urge that I stand in a very insecure position, and that for my children's sake, as well <b>as</b> <b>my</b> <b>own,</b> I ought to marry again." [...] Dalton feared that by remaining sealed to Charles, she would forfeit her claim to her children. Perhaps because Charles was a drinker, her [...] "brethren" [...] considered him unworthy of his sealing. Her sealing cancellation was approved in 1887 and then revoked after her death in 1931.|$|E
500|$|Rihanna later {{described}} the sentiment {{she wanted to}} express as [...] "gangsta", and elaborated on how reggae culture has influenced her musical style: [...] "I'm super inspired by reggae music [...] {{has been a part}} of me since I was born, and I grew up listening to it. I was exciting for me to take this on <b>as</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> and do a song like this, especially with the lyrics being like that." [...] The track was composed during Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth tour. The song's instrumental was recorded by Cary Clark at The Village in Los Angeles. Kuk Harrell produced Rihanna's vocals with Josh Gudwin and Marcos Tovar at Westlake Recording Studios, also in Los Angeles. Bobby Campbell assisted with vocal production and recording. The song was mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Sound Studios in Los Angeles, assisted by Erik Madrid and Christian Plata.|$|E
500|$|The Rices {{moved back}} to San Francisco in 1962, {{experiencing}} {{the birth of the}} Hippie movement firsthand as they lived in the soon-to-be fabled Haight-Ashbury district, Berkeley, and later the Castro District. [...] "I'm a totally conservative person," [...] she later told The New York Times, [...] "In the middle of Haight-Ashbury in the 1960s, I was typing away while everybody was dropping acid and smoking grass. I was known <b>as</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> square." [...] Rice attended San Francisco State University and obtained a B.A. in Political Science in 1964. Their daughter Michele, later nicknamed [...] "Mouse", was born to the couple on September 21, 1966, and Rice later interrupted her graduate studies at SFSU to become a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Berkeley. However, she soon became disenchanted with the emphasis on literary criticism and the language requirements. In Rice's words, [...] "I wanted to be a writer, not a literature student." ...|$|E

500|$|The film's {{score was}} {{performed}} by the London Symphony Orchestra with Belgian composer Dirk Brossé conducting. It was recorded in the United Kingdom at the Watford Coloseum and the London AIR Lyndhurst Hall and was mixed at the Manhattan Center Studios in the United States. In the liner notes to the album, Goldenthal describes the soundtrack as combining [...] "orchestration techniques associated with the late 20th-century Polish avant-garde, as well <b>as</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> experiments from Alien 3, and 19th-century Straussian brass and string instrumentation." [...] In the film's 'Making of' featurette, Goldenthal states he used [...] "ghostly choral" [...] music when the Phantoms are emerging, {{in an attempt to}} give a celestial feeling, and focused on low brass clusters and taiko drum rhythms for violent scenes. When Aki talks about a dying girl, Goldenthal used a piano in order to give a domestic home-like feeling to a completely foreign environment, also choosing to use a flute each time Aki focusses on Gaia, as he believed it to be the most [...] "human kind of instrument".|$|E
2500|$|Their tutor Aristotle {{described}} friendship as [...] "...one soul abiding in two bodies". That {{they themselves}} considered their friendship {{to be of}} such a kind is shown by {{the stories of the}} morning after the battle of Issus. Diodorus, Arrian and Curtius all describe the scene when Alexander and Hephaestion went together to visit the captured Persian royal family. Its senior member, the queen Sisygambis, knelt to Hephaestion to plead for their lives, having mistaken him for Alexander because he was taller, and both young men were wearing similar clothes. When she realized her mistake she was acutely embarrassed, but Alexander pardoned her, saying [...] "You were not mistaken, Mother; this man too is Alexander." [...] Their love for each other was no secret, as is borne out by their own words. Hephaestion, when replying to a letter to Alexander's mother, Olympias, said [...] "...you know that Alexander means more to us than anything." [...] Arrian says that Alexander, after Hephaestion's death, described him as [...] "...the friend I valued <b>as</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> life." [...] Paul Cartledge describes their closeness when he says: [...] "Alexander seems actually to have referred to Hephaestion as his alter ego." ...|$|E
2500|$|Angus Stone {{began to}} play his new solo music at Splendour in the Grass in Byron Bay in July 2012. In September that year he {{embarked}} on a solo tour of the US, UK, continental Europe, and Australia with sold out shows including Brussels, Utrecht, Berlin and both his Los Angeles and New York shows. Upon {{the start of his}} solo tour Angus said, [...] "To play live <b>as</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> in front of those people, it's going to be a different trail of gravel and gold, but none the less very exciting ... it's a whole different trip". His live performances have garnered praise, The Stanford Dailys Sasha Arijanto reported being [...] "bewitched by the dulcet sounds from the stage". After Stone's show in Montreal, Caitlin Grimes from Confront Magazine stated, [...] "don’t think I can name another artist who can manage to grab you by the wrist and pull you into such stories with him". Stone completed his first solo shows in Australia including at Enmore Theatre in Sydney on 1 November. He performed at the Australian summer festivals including Homebake, [...] Woodford, [...] Falls (both Lorne and Marion Bay), and [...] Southbound in Western Australia. In early 2013 he is due to start a European tour including London's Shepherds Bush Empire.|$|E

2500|$|After the game, Lyle Blackwood {{criticized the}} referee's ruling of Freddie Solomon's fumble as an {{incomplete}} pass. [...] "You don't want {{the game to}} hinge on that play, but you never know," [...] Blackwood said. [...] "I could have taken the ball up the sideline. That's a 14-point swing." [...] However, other Dolphins were not convinced. [...] "We were dominated {{to the point where}} one play didn't make much of a difference," [...] said Dolphins coach Don Shula. [...] "Our major objective was to contain Montana, and we did a terrible, terrible job of it," [...] added defensive coach Chuck Studley. Even Reggie Roby, who averaged only 39.3 yards per punt and didn't place any of his 6 punts inside the 20, took some responsibility for the loss. [...] "I was trying to kill the ball, and I kicked it bad," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't hit one well. I was scared – scared to make a mistake. It was the worst game of my life, counting high school, college, counting everything." [...] Meanwhile, in the 49ers' locker room, Joe Montana had his own explanation for the win. [...] "As far <b>as</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> game, well, I'd have to admit it was pretty close to the best I've ever played. I didn't throw anything I didn't have confidence in. We got in sort of a groove. Once you get going like that you gain confidence, and it carries over to the defense, and then back to the offense. It's a snowball kind of thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Qizhou {{was a major}} {{fortress}} city situated {{near the}} Yangtze and a 25 thousand strong Jin army advanced on it in 1221. News of the approaching army reached Zhao Yurong in Qizhou, and despite being outnumbered nearly eight to one, he decided to hold the city. Qizhou's arsenal consisted of some three thousand thunderclap bombs, twenty thousand [...] "great leather bombs" [...] (皮大炮), and thousands of gunpowder arrows and gunpowder crossbow bolts. While the formula for gunpowder had become potent enough to consider the Song bombs to be true explosives, {{they were unable to}} match the explosive power of the Jin iron bombs. Yurong describes the uneven exchange thus, [...] "The barbaric enemy attacked the Northwest Tower with an unceasing flow of catapult projectiles from thirteen catapults. Each catapult shot was followed by an iron fire bomb , whose sound was like thunder. That day, the city soldiers in facing the catapult shots showed great courage as they maneuvered [...] catapults, hindered by injuries from the iron fire bombs. Their heads, their eyes, their cheeks were exploded to bits, and only one half [...] was left." [...] Jin artillerists were able to successfully target the command center itself: [...] "The enemy fired off catapult stones ... nonstop day and night, and the magistrate's headquarters [...] at the eastern gate, as well <b>as</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> quarters ..., were hit by the most iron fire bombs, {{to the point that they}} struck even on top of [...] sleeping quarters and [...] nearly perished! Some said there was a traitor. If not, how would they have known the way to strike at both of these places?" [...] Zhao was able to examine the new iron bombs himself and described thus, [...] "In shape they are like gourds, but with a small mouth. They are made with pig iron, about two inches thick, and they cause the city's walls to shake." [...] Houses were blown apart, towers battered, and defenders blasted from their placements. Within four weeks all four gates were under heavy bombardment. Finally the Jin made a frontal assault on the walls and scaled them, after which followed a merciless hunt for soldiers, officers, and officials of every level. Zhao managed an escape by clambering over the battlement and making a hasty retreat across the river, but his family remained in the city. Upon returning at a later date to search the ruins, he found that the [...] "bones and skeletons were so mixed up that there was no way to tell who was who." ...|$|E
