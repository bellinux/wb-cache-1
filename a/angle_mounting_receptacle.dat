40|$|Abstract – In {{the case}} of non{{circular}} journal bearings, as opposed to circular journal bearings, the orientation of bearing {{with respect to a}} given load direction can be a design parameter. This orientation may be defined in terms of an angle, which in the present work is being referred to as the <b>mount</b> <b>angle.</b> The purpose of the work presented in this paper is to study the effect of the <b>mount</b> <b>angle</b> on the theoretical static and dynamic characteristics of three types of gas-lubricated noncircular bearings. It is found that the effect of the <b>mount</b> <b>angle</b> happens to be more pronounced at low compressibility numbers. Also, among the three types of bearings, the effect of the <b>mount</b> <b>angle</b> is more significant in two lobe bearings in comparison to the three and four lobe bearings...|$|R

Street lights need more energy in winter than in summer due to longer winter nights. However, for a solar powered system, less energy is available in winter with less intense sunlight and shorter days. The <b>mounting</b> <b>angle</b> of panels has {{a great impact on}} the cumulative energy output of the panels. Our investigation shows that while a <b>mounting</b> <b>angle</b> of 23. 1 ° yields maximum energy collection in summer and minimum energy collection in winter, a <b>mounting</b> <b>angle</b> of 46. 5 ° increases the energy collection in winter and yields more or less uniform energy collection throughout the year. Assuming a panel efficiency of 16 %, an average cumulative energy output of 950 Wh/m 2 /day with about 5 - 8 % variation throughout the year has been found with a <b>mounting</b> <b>angle</b> of 46. 5 °. This results in about 9 % reduction in the panel size than that required with a <b>mounting</b> <b>angle</b> of 231 °. Moreover, installing a traffic sensor in the lighting system will allow detection of traffic density, thereby operating the lamps at different intensity levels as per requirements. This will save energy wastage in time of low or no traffic and will further relax the requirement on system size. Publishe...|$|R

50|$|The French Navy {{used two}} {{versions}} of the Hotchkiss 3-pounder. The first was the short barreled M1885 40 caliber version and the second was the long barreled M1902 50 caliber version. The French L/40 M1885 and the British QF 3-pounder were largely the same gun. Like the British who paired their 3-pounders with the larger QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss the French often paired theirs with the Canon de 65 mm Modèle 1891 sometimes called a 9-pounder in English publications. The 3-pounder was primarily used as anti-torpedo boat defense aboard armored cruisers, destroyers, ironclads, pre-dreadnought battleships, protected cruisers and submarines.
