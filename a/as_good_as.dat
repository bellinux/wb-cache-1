60|$|Arthur Wilkinson {{was very}} nearly {{of the same}} age. He was just older than young Bertram--by three months or so; just {{sufficiently}} to give to Wilkinson a feeling of seniority when they first met, and a consciousness that as he was the senior in age, he should be the senior in scholastic lore. But this consciousness Wilkinson {{was not able to}} attain; and during all the early years of his life, he was making a vain struggle to be <b>as</b> <b>good</b> a man <b>as</b> his cousin; that is, <b>as</b> <b>good</b> in scholarship, <b>as</b> <b>good</b> in fighting, <b>as</b> <b>good</b> in play, and <b>as</b> <b>good</b> in spirit.|$|R

He was <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> his word: Pablo made his Segunda División debut in a 1–1 draw away to Terrassa on 31 August 2002, and went on to start 38 of Albacete's 42 matches as they finished the season in third place and were promoted to La Liga. After only a few second-tier matches, he had made sufficient impact to attract interest from clubs both domestic and foreign and receive a call-up to the Spanish under-21 team for a friendly match against Bulgaria.|$|E

Aside from The Simpsons, Smith has recorded few voice-over parts, only commercials and the film We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story. Smith starred in and served as executive producer for the independent romantic comedy Waiting For Ophelia, which had its world premiere at the Phoenix Film Festival in April 2009.|$|E

Bonfire was retired from competition after the 2000 Olympic Games.

Due to their proximity and the relationship between their businesses, the Kitamura and Tsukishima families have been close for many years, and their children go {{back and forth between the}} two homes. Because Ko and Wakaba are the same age and always together, Aoba is jealous of all the time Ko spends with her older sister. Aoba is a natural pitcher with excellent form, and Ko secretly trains to become <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> she is, even while publicly showing little interest in baseball.

5|$|In 2006, the {{sustained}} rise {{in oil prices}} had only a limited impact on demand. It was a good year across all segments of the tanker market segments, but not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> 2004 and 2005. Amidst high oil prices, geopolitical tension, and fears of disruptions to the oil supply, growing demand was the main driving force in the tanker shipping market for the year. As demand grew moderately in the United States and Western Europe, expanding economies such as China fueled exponential growth in demand. Despite these strengths, {{each of the five}} tanker freight indices dropped during 2006. Product tanker demand increased in 2006 due to economic expansion in Asia, especially China and India, however, average time charter equivalent earnings for these ships decreased compared with the two prior years.|$|E

The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.|$|E

The title race was <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> over by February, when Arsenal lost 6–1 to United at Old Trafford. The season gave priority to cups, with the best chance of ending their three-year wait for a trophy being in the FA Cup; Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotspur in the semi-finals and met Liverpool in the final. Although they dominated most of the match and went a goal up, they succumbed to two late Michael Owen goals and lost 2–1.|$|E
5|$|In the Northern Territory, P. fimbriata has {{no special}} tactics against other jumping spiders {{and tries to}} treat {{them as if they}} were web spiders, and then either tries to jump on them or gives up. Hence this variant is poor at {{catching}} other jumping spiders. The Northern Territory variant of P. fimbriata is not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> the Queensland one as catching web spiders, but better than the Sri Lanka variant and some other species of Portia. It is not enthusiastic about pursuing insects, but very good at catching those it pursues, as the performance table above shows While pursuits by the Queensland variant typically take 26minutes, those of the Northern Territory variant typically take 3 to 5minutes, like some other species of Portia.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-19thcentury, manor {{owners in}} Estonia found the native Estonian Horse {{too small for}} their {{agricultural}} needs, {{and came to the}} conclusion that the population would benefit from crossbreeding. Finnish horses were among the good quality breeds considered for the job. The state stud farm of Tori was founded as the central base for the new Estonian breed in 1856, and ten Finnish mares and three stallions were bought for its needs. Though some purebred Finnish horses were produced, they were used mainly for crossbreeding; the later offspring of part-Finnish crossbreds, however, did not prove <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> expected, and the Tori stud gradually stopped using Finnish horses. One Finnish-Arabian stallion, Orro, has had noteworthy influence on the modern-day Tori horse, through his widely used great-grandson Harun 42 T.|$|E

Mahesh goes through his father's photograph collection, finally understanding their angles and lighting, and gets an idea.|$|E
5|$|Long, highly {{sensitive}} whiskers and front paws help the sea otter find prey by touch when waters are dark or murky. Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly {{when the wind}} is blowing towards the animals, indicating the sense of smell is more important than sight as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, although not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> that of seals. Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.|$|E
5|$|Most fish possess highly {{developed}} sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have color vision {{that is at}} least <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> a human's (see vision in fishes). Many fish also have chemoreceptors {{that are responsible for}} extraordinary senses of taste and smell. Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the Ampullae of Lorenzini, organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt. Other fish, like the South American electric fishes Gymnotiformes, can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication.|$|E
