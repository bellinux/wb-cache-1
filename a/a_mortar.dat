5|$|Based on his {{research}} for the book and mini-series The Pacific, author Hugh Ambrose suggested that Basilone was not killed by <b>a</b> <b>mortar,</b> but by small arms fire that {{hit him in the}} right groin and the neck, and nearly took off his left arm.|$|E

5|$|Standard US {{tank and}} armored {{infantry}} battalions had <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> platoon equipped with either M21s or the older M4 MMCs. The M21 was used mainly to illuminate targets {{at night or}} provide indirect fire support to the infantry. The usage was uncommon because the White Motor Company was only able to produce 110 M21s in 1944.|$|E
5|$|The final {{attack on}} 28 February also began with <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> attack, but the {{communist}} assault wave was broken up by mortar fire, {{and was forced}} to withdraw to the east. Three Americans were wounded. A clearing patrol later revealed that the Viet Cong had inserted <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> team {{to the edge of the}} rubber trees by night in a Lambretta and a cart and had then manhandled the tubes into position. 3 RAR's defence of FSB Andersen was the first occasion in the history of their operations in Vietnam that an Australian fire support base had been subjected to a ground assault while during all three attacks the cavalry and artillery in support had played a key role in the defence. Throughout the later part of the operation the patrolling rifle companies had systematically searched the AO and although contact was infrequent the patrols had been effective in denying the subsequent use of the area to launch rocket attacks against the bases in Long Binh and Bien Hoa.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{agricultural}} activities practised {{during the dry}} season, which halts work in the rice fields, the most traditional are those related to the exploitation of African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), which provides two products which are very popular in the region: palm oil and palm wine. Palm oil is an essential ingredient in local cuisine. As a carefully preserved condiment, it is combined with plain rice on holidays. The oil comes from the fruit clusters which are picked by men and then deseeded, allowed to dry, crushed in <b>a</b> <b>mortar,</b> and boiled by women.|$|E
5|$|On 23 January the RIRA {{attacked}} Ebrington Army Barracks in Derry for {{a second}} time, firing <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> over a perimeter fence. <b>A</b> <b>mortar</b> {{similar to the one}} used in the attack was found by Gardaí near Newtowncunningham on 13 February, and British army bomb disposal experts made safe another mortar found between Dungannon and Carrickmore on 12 April. On 1 August a 40lb bomb was discovered in a car at the long-stay car park of Belfast International Airport following a telephone warning, and was made safe with two controlled explosions by bomb disposal experts. In December a six-day security operation ended when a 70lb bomb found under railway tracks at Killeen Bridge near Newry was defused. The operation began following telephone warnings, and the road and railway line connecting Newry to Dundalk were closed due to security alerts. A pipe bomb was discovered at a police officer's home in Annalong, County Down on 3 January 2002, and two teenage boys were injured in County Armagh on 2 March when a bomb hidden in a traffic cone exploded. On 29 March 2002 the RIRA targeted {{a former member of the}} Royal Irish Regiment from Sion Mills, County Tyrone, with a bomb attached to his car that failed to explode. On 1 August 2002 a civilian worker was killed by an explosion at a Territorial Army base in Derry. The man, a 51-year-old former member of the Ulster Defence Regiment, was the thirtieth person killed by the RIRA.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 1995, <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> shell {{slammed into}} a Sarajevo marketplace, killing 37 people. The United States {{subsequently}} blamed Bosnian Serb forces for the attack. Admiral Leighton Smith, the NATO commander, recommended that NATO launch retaliatory air strikes against the Serbs under the plan established for Operation Deliberate Force. On 30 August 1995, NATO officially launched Operation Deliberate Force with large-scale bombing of Serb targets. This bombing superseded Operation Deny Flight's role for air strikes and close air support, but Deny Flight remained an active operation, still enforcing the no-fly zone over Bosnia.|$|E

All implore Bond to come out of retirement to deal with SMERSH who have been eliminating agents: Bond spurns all their pleas. When Bond continues to stand firm, his mansion is destroyed by <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> attack at the orders of M, who is, however, killed in the explosion.|$|E
5|$|The M4 was {{developed}} to meet the need for a specialized mortar carrier based on the M2 Half Track Car, which the M21 soon replaced. The initial M4 was designed to carry <b>a</b> <b>mortar.</b> In emergencies, the mortar could be fired from the vehicle. The improved M4A1 had a reinforced floor so that the mortar could be fired from the vehicle, but the mounting faced to the rear and lacked traverse. This caused problems when the troops who operated the mortar mounted the vehicle, so the US 2nd Armored Division relocated the mortars so that they could fire from the front.|$|E
5|$|The semicircular apse fits {{naturally}} {{with the}} other vaults of the rotunda despite being larger, and features vaults on its north and south walls. The marble ambon was situated {{in the middle of}} the circle of columns and of the whole rotunda, directly under the dome's centre, as evidenced by <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> padding. Stairs from the east and west, aligned with the apse, used to lead up to the ambon. The bishop's throne or cathedra probably lay near one of the south vaults, which was likely enlarged for the purpose.|$|E

5|$|Both Omar's {{father and}} uncle were killed {{following}} <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> attack on Bakaara Market, where they worked. Omar {{was in the}} eighth grade at the time, and she dropped out of school in response to look after her siblings while her mother sold produce to provide for the family. Following the encouragement of her mother, she decided to take up running. She would train at Mogadishu Stadium, as the family lived nearby in a hovel. The stadium had a gravel running track, pitted with mortar craters from the ongoing Somali Civil War. When not running at the stadium, she would run on the streets of Mogadishu, facing harassment from local militants who did not believe that Muslim women should participate in sporting activities.|$|E
5|$|By day six, 22 September, {{the battle}} {{had settled into}} a routine of mortaring and small probing attacks at times {{supported}} by armoured vehicles and sniper fire. The Poles, dug in south of the river, relieved part of {{the pressure on the}} division, as some German forces were diverted to confront them. The following day began in a similar way to previous days with <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> and artillery bombardment, followed by infantry and armour trying to find a gap in the perimeter. The KOSB, Glider Pilots and the 21st Independent Company who were all defending the brigade area were repeatedly attacked. Furthermore, food and water shortages also took their toll on the men, with foraging parties subjected to sniper fire. On day eight, 24 September, although German attacks continued, the enemy were engaged by artillery of the XXX Corps south of the river and aircraft from the Royal Air Force. This broke up most assaults before they got started.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day on}} September 3, Coulter and the KMAG {{advisers}} {{continued to}} clash with the ROK 3rd Division commander, who repeatedly attempted to withdraw his troops against their orders. That night, September 3/4, {{the remainder of the}} ROK I Corps front collapsed. Three North Korean T-34 tanks overran a battery of ROK artillery and then scattered two battalions of the newly arrived ROK 5th Regiment. Following <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> preparation, the North Koreans entered An'gang-ni at 0220. An hour later the command post of the Capital Division withdrew from the town and fighting became increasingly confused. American units disengaged and withdrew and by nightfall, North Koreans held the town and began advancing southward along the railroad.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{was born}} in Winnipeg, Manitoba on December 7, 1898. He was an {{accomplished}} football and lacrosse player in his youth. He joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force in 1916 and fought for {{three years in the}} trenches of France as part of <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> outfit. Johnson returned to Winnipeg following the war and worked for an electric light company. He first played competitive hockey in 1919 when he joined the Winnipeg Monarchs of the Winnipeg Senior Hockey League. He played two seasons with the Monarchs before moving to Eveleth, Minnesota where he joined the local team to play three seasons in the United States Amateur Hockey Association (USAHA). He then played three seasons in Minneapolis, concluding in 1925–26 with the Minneapolis Millers. He was named a league all-star on defence in both 1924 and 1926.|$|E
5|$|Just as they {{finished}} their report, the detachment was fired on by Ustaše Militia. The Ustaše called {{for help from}} Sinj, and by 18:00, Italian reinforcements had arrived and began encircling the detachment, engaging them with mortars and light artillery. Outnumbered and facing an enemy with greater firepower, the Partisans planned to hold their positions until evening then retreat using the cover of darkness. About 20:00, Kovačević-Lala, {{one of the most}} experienced members of the detachment, was killed after being hit by <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> round, which had a significant effect on the morale of the remaining fighters. Borovčić-Kurir issued the order to retreat, but it turned into chaos as individuals fled the area.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell's {{most notable}} service {{came during the}} Adriatic {{campaign}} of 1807–1814. Alceste was despatched to the Adriatic Sea to support James Brisbane {{in the absence of}} William Hoste, who had been wounded at the Battle of Lissa in March 1811. On 4 May, Maxwell and Brisbane led an attack on Parenza, where a brig carrying supplies to Ragusa had taken shelter. Seizing an island {{at the mouth of the}} harbour, the British established <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> position overlooking the anchorage, and sank the brig with a heavy bombardment. In November 1811, with the temporary absence of Brisbane, Maxwell became the senior officer in the Adriatic. Seven months later, a convoy of French frigates carrying cannon from Corfu to Trieste was spotted attempting to slip past his base of operations on the island of Lissa. Ashore in Port St. George, Maxwell was informed by telegraph, and led Alceste and the rest of his squadron and in pursuit.|$|E
