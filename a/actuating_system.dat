40|$|Since the piezoelectrically <b>actuated</b> <b>system</b> has {{nonlinear}} and time-varying behavior, it {{is difficult}} to establish an accurate dynamic model for a model-based sensing and control design. Here, a model-free adaptive sliding controller is proposed to improve the small travel and hysteresis defects of piezoelectrically <b>actuated</b> <b>systems.</b> This sensing and control strategy employs the functional approximation technique (FAT) to establish the unknown function for eliminating the model-based requirement of the sliding-mode control. The piezoelectrically <b>actuated</b> <b>system’s</b> nonlinear functions can be approximated by using the combination of a finite number of weighted Fourier series basis functions. The unknown weighted vector can be estimated by an updating rule. The important advantage of this approach is to achieve the sliding-mode controller design without the system dynamic model requirement. The update laws for the coefficients of the Fourier series functions are derived from a Lyapunov function to guarantee the control system stability. This proposed controller is implemented on a piezoelectrically actuated X-Y table.

40|$|We define as {{an optimal}} mixer a mixing device {{able to deliver}} a uniformly optimal mixing {{performance}} {{over a wide range}} of operating and initial conditions. We consider the conceptual problem of designing an optimal mixer starting from a well-known reference mixer, the sine flow. We characterize the mixing performance of the reference mixer, and show that it performs poorly and erratically over a wide range of operating conditions and is quite sensitive to the geometry of the initial concentration field. We define as a target performance the best mixing performance the reference mixer is able to achieve. In steps we modify the design of the reference mixer. First, we optimize the time sequence of the switching protocols and show that the mixing performance of the time-optimized mixer, although substantially improved with respect to the reference mixer, is still far from achieving the target performance and being insensitive to the geometry of the initial concentration field. The analysis of the performance of the time-optimized mixer brings to light the deficiency of the <b>actuating</b> <b>system</b> used, which delivers always the same amount of shear at the same locations. We modify the <b>actuating</b> <b>system</b> by allowing the stirring velocity fields to shift along their coordinate axes. A new mixer, the space-optimized mixer, is created by equipping the reference mixer with the new <b>actuating</b> <b>system</b> and optimizing the shift of the stirring velocity field at each iteration. The space-optimized mixer is able to deliver the target performance over the upper two-thirds of the operating range. In the lower one-third, the performance of the space-optimized mixer deteriorates because of the use of a periodic protocol. A optimal mixer is finally obtained using the <b>actuating</b> <b>system</b> of the space-optimized mixer and coupling the time and shift optimizations. The resulting optimal mixer is able to deliver a uniform target performance, insensitive to the geometry of the initial conditions, over the entire operating range...|$|E

40|$|The central {{objective}} of the proposed work is to demonstrate an HCCI (homogeneous charge compression ignition) capable SI (spark ignited) engine {{that is capable of}} fast and smooth mode transition between SI and HCCI combustion modes. The model-based control technique was used to develop and validate the proposed control strategy for the fast and smooth combustion mode transition based upon the developed control-oriented engine; and an HCCI capable SI engine was designed and constructed using production ready two-step valve-train with electrical variable valve timing <b>actuating</b> <b>system.</b> Finally, smooth combustion mode transition was demonstrated on a metal engine within eight engine cycles. The Chrysler turbocharged 2. 0 L I 4 direct injection engine was selected as the base engine for the project and the engine was modified to fit the two-step valve with electrical variable valve timing <b>actuating</b> <b>system.</b> To develop the model-based control strategy for stable HCCI combustion and smooth combustion mode transition between SI and HCCI combustion, a control-oriented real-time engine model was developed and implemented into the MSU HIL (hardware-in-the-loop) simulation environment. The developed model was used to study the engine <b>actuating</b> <b>system</b> requirement for the smooth and fast combustion mode transition and to develop the proposed mode transition control strategy. Finally, a single cylinder optical engine was designed and fabricated for studying the HCCI combustion characteristics. Optical engine combustion tests were conducted in both SI and HCCI combustion modes and the test results were used to calibrate the developed control-oriented engine model. Intensive GT-Power simulations were conducted to determine the optimal valve lift (high and low) and the cam phasing range. Delphi was selected to be the supplier for the two-step valve-train and Denso to be the electrical variable valve timing system supplier. A test bench was constructed to develop control strategies for the electrical variable valve timing (VVT) <b>actuating</b> <b>system</b> and satisfactory electrical VVT responses were obtained. Target engine control system was designed and fabricated at MSU for both single-cylinder optical and multi-cylinder metal engines. Finally, the developed control-oriented engine model was successfully implemented into the HIL simulation environment. The Chrysler 2. 0 L I 4 DI engine was modified to fit the two-step vale with electrical variable valve timing <b>actuating</b> <b>system.</b> A used prototype engine was used as the base engine and the cylinder head was modified for the two-step valve with electrical VVT <b>actuating</b> <b>system.</b> Engine validation tests indicated that cylinder # 3 has very high blow-by and it cannot be reduced with new pistons and rings. Due to the time constraint, it was decided to convert the four-cylinder engine into a single cylinder engine by blocking both intake and exhaust ports of the unused cylinders. The model-based combustion mode transition control algorithm was developed in the MSU HIL simulation environment and the Simulink based control strategy was implemented into the target engine controller. With both single-cylinder metal engine and control strategy ready, stable HCCI combustion was achived with COV of 2. 1 % Motoring tests were conducted to validate the actuator transient operations including valve lift, electrical variable valve timing, electronic throttle, multiple spark and injection controls. After the actuator operations were confirmed, 15 -cycle smooth combustion mode transition from SI to HCCI combustion was achieved; and fast 8 -cycle smooth combustion mode transition followed. With a fast electrical variable valve timing actuator, the number of engine cycles required for mode transition can be reduced down to five. It was also found that the combustion mode transition is sensitive to the charge air and engine coolant temperatures and regulating the corresponding temperatures to the target levels during the combustion mode transition is the key for a smooth combustion mode transition. As a summary, the proposed combustion mode transition strategy using the hybrid combustion mode that starts with the SI combustion and ends with the HCCI combustion was experimentally validated on a metal engine. The proposed model-based control approach made it possible to complete the SI-HCCI combustion mode transition within eight engine cycles utilizing the well controlled hybrid combustion mode. Without intensive control-oriented engine modeling and HIL simulation study of using the hybrid combustion mode during the mode transition, {{it would be impossible to}} validate the proposed combustion mode transition strategy in a very short period...|$|E
