5|$|The path {{originated}} as a {{route for}} the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They {{needed to be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> down into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct path between two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard {{but it has been}} transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days before}} the 1995 Illinois state competition, Steinmetz High School {{obtained}} copies of the tests from the DeVry Institute of Technology, where the state finals were being held. The team was therefore <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up and memorize the answers. The cheating allowed Steinmetz to beat perennial powerhouse Whitney Young Magnet High School, who had won the Illinois state finals in 22 of the previous 23 years. Six of the twelve students in the nation who scored over 900 points on the math test came from Steinmetz High School, prompting the Illinois state Academic Decathlon to suspect cheating. The Steinmetz team was disqualified after team members refused to take an alternate version of the test, and its coach eventually resigned. The incident was dramatized in the movie Cheaters.|$|E

The Willis Tower has an observation deck open to tourists year round with high up views overlooking Chicago and Lake Michigan. The observation deck includes an enclosed glass balcony that extends 10 feet out {{on the side of}} the building. Tourists are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> straight down.|$|E
50|$|Adjacency {{lists are}} {{generally}} preferred because they efficiently represent sparse graphs. An adjacency matrix is preferred if the graph is dense, {{that is the}} number of edges |E | is close to the number of vertices squared, |V |2, or if one must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> quickly <b>look</b> up if there is an edge connecting two vertices.|$|R

Like Dalton and Mike, Winston is one of Red Green's friends and takes part in the day-to-day operations at Possum Lodge. He is always seen wearing a hard hat, a white button-down shirt, a bowtie and hip waders. He is generally upbeat and has a positive outlook on life, and is usually <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{on the bright side}} of things {{even in the face of}} certain disaster. He is also a fan of self help speakers Anthony Anthony (whom he likes to quote) and Walter Mollusk.|$|E
25|$|The {{technology}} {{was first used}} by Channel 4 during a Test match between England and Pakistan on Lord's Cricket Ground, on 21 May 2001. It is used primarily {{by the majority of}} television networks to track the trajectory of balls in flight. In the winter season of 2008/2009 the ICC trialled a referral system where Hawk-Eye was used for referring decisions to the third umpire if a team disagreed with an LBW decision. The third umpire was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at what the ball actually did up to the point when it hit the batsman, but could not look at the predicted flight of the ball after it hit the batsman.|$|E

60|$|Caroline {{continued}} {{very ill}} all the evening, hardly <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up, and {{every attempt to}} speak or swallow causing her great pain. Her mother would not leave her again, and sat watching her, and she smiled, and gave a pleased look of surprise at her kindness, which she had so long missed; but her chief comfort {{seemed to be in}} Marian's presence. She followed her about the room with her eyes, and was uneasy whenever she fancied that she was going out of the room.|$|R
25|$|Visual memory, in an {{academic}} environment, entails work with pictures, symbols, numbers, letters, and especially words. Students must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at a word, form an image of that word in their minds {{and be able to}} recall the appearance of the word later. When teachers introduce a new vocabulary word, generally they write it on the chalkboard, have the children spell it, read it and then use it in a sentence. The word is then erased from the chalkboard. Students with good visual memory will recognize that same word later in their readers or other texts and will be able to recall the appearance of the word to spell it.|$|E
25|$|To reduce {{noise from}} the street, Wright {{eliminated}} street level windows in the temple. Instead, natural light comes from stained glass windows in the roof and clerestories along the upper walls. Because {{the members of the}} parish would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> outside, Unity Temple's stained glass was designed with green, yellow, and brown tones in order to evoke the colors of nature. The main floor of the temple is accessed via a lower floor (which has seating space), and the room also has two balconies for the seating of the congregation. These varying seating levels allowed the architect to design a building to fit the size of the congregation, but efficiently: no one person in the congregation is more than 40 feet from the pulpit. Wright also designed the building with very good acoustics.|$|E
25|$|The Walking Dead is {{a graphic}} adventure, played from a third-person {{perspective}} {{with a variety}} of cinematic camera angles, in which the player, as protagonist Lee Everett, works with a rag-tag group of survivors to stay alive {{in the midst of a}} zombie apocalypse. The player can examine and interact with characters and items, and must make use of inventory items and the environment. Throughout the game, the player is presented with the ability to interact with their surroundings, and options to determine the nature of that interaction. For example, the player may be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at a character, talk to that character, or if they are carrying an item, offer it to the character or ask them about it. According to Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead game is focused more on developing characters and story, and less on the action tropes that tend to feature in other zombie-based games, such as Left 4 Dead.|$|E

25|$|In {{racing and}} very-high-performance road cars, other disc {{materials}} have been employed. Reinforced carbon discs and pads inspired by aircraft braking {{systems such as}} those used on Concorde were introduced in Formula One by Brabham in conjunction with Dunlop in 1976. Carbon–carbon braking is now used in most top-level motorsport worldwide, reducing unsprung weight, giving better frictional performance and improved structural properties at high temperatures, compared to cast iron. Carbon brakes have occasionally been applied to road cars, by the French Venturi sports car manufacturer in the mid 1990s for example, but need to reach a very high operating temperature before becoming truly effective and so are not well suited to road use. The extreme heat generated in these systems is easily visible during night racing, especially at shorter tracks. It {{is not uncommon to}} be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the cars, either live in person or on television and see the brake discs glowing red during application.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} that {{companies}} recognize ERM as a critical management issue. This is demonstrated through the prominence assigned to ERM within organizations and the resources devoted to building ERM capabilities. In a 2008 survey by Towers Perrin, at most life insurance companies, responsibility for ERM resides within the C-suite. Most often, the chief risk officer (CRO) or {{the chief financial officer}} (CFO) is in charge of ERM, and these individuals typically report directly to the chief executive officer. From their vantage point, the CRO and CFO are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> across the organization and develop a perspective on the risk profile of the firm and how that profile matches its risk appetite. They act as drivers to improve skills, tools and processes for evaluating risks and to weigh various actions to manage those exposures. Companies are also actively enhancing their ERM tools and capabilities. Three quarters of responding companies said they have tools for specifically monitoring and managing enterprise-wide risk. These tools are used primarily for identifying and measuring risk and for management decision making. Respondents also reported that they have made good progress in building their ERM capabilities in certain areas.|$|E
25|$|On 24 September, Menshikov {{began to}} move his army out of Sevastopol towards Bakchi Serai and Simferopol, leaving Admirals Kornilov and Nakhimov to organise the 18,000-strong {{garrison}} (mainly sailors and marines) and prepare the port's defences. By venturing into {{the interior of the}} Crimea, Menshikov would not only keep open his communications with Russia, but would also be in touch with reinforcements from Odessa or Kertch; moreover, he would be free to operate in the field and threaten the Allied flank. Whilst Menshikov moved east, the Anglo-French-Turkish army, with the British in the vanguard, continued its march towards the southern coast of the peninsula. The heat was oppressive, the water sparse, and cholera rife, taking a heavy toll on the men including Saint-Arnaud who was already ill with cancer. The march had been a real trial and was not without incident. At one point, on 25 September near MacKenzie's Farm, Raglan and his staff in front of the British column stumbled across the rear of the retreating Russians; {{with the rest of his}} army strung out behind in hopeless disorder, Menshikov missed a chance to inflict a major reverse on the British. By the 26th, however, Raglan had reached the village of Kadikoi, and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> down on the narrow inlet of Balaclava. That same day Saint-Arnaud, now critically ill, surrendered his command to General Canrobert.|$|E
5000|$|The vampires in the {{canonical}} Buffyverse differ greatly {{from those that}} appear in the 1992 Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie. The movie's vampires are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fly, <b>look</b> pale but relatively human, and do not crumble to dust when killed. The canonical vampires, introduced in the first episode of the television series, are demonic spirits that inhabit human corpses. Because of their partly human nature, vampires are considered impure by other demons who sometimes call them [...] "blood rats".|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{shows how}} moral {{decisions}} {{can be drawn}} computationally by using ACORDA, a working implementation of prospective logic programming. ACORDA is employed to model moral dilemmas, as they are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> prospectively <b>look</b> ahead at the consequences of hypothetical moral judgments. With this knowledge of consequences, moral rules are then used to decide the appropriate moral judgments. The whole moral reasoning is achieved via a priori constraints and a posteriori preferences on abductive stable models, two features available in ACORDA. ...|$|R

And looking in again at half-past seven, he found Harry half dressed, with his arm round Mary; laughing, almost sobbing, over the treasures in his cupboard, which he had newly discovered in their fresh order.|$|R
500|$|By this time, Pickingill was {{increasingly}} inflating his age, eventually {{claiming that he}} was 105 years old. This attracted attention from other areas, including London, and in September 1908 a journalist visited Canewdon; he arrived by automobile, the first that Pickingill had ever seen, and allowed the old man to ride in it. The journalist subsequently wrote {{an article about the}} alleged centegenerian, in which he claimed that his name was [...] "Frederick Pickingale"; it is possible that Pickingill gave the false name so that no one would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up the parish records and discover his real age.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} this, reviewers {{generally}} {{felt that the}} drawbacks of the game were minor in comparison to its strengths. IGN concluded that [...] "Morrowind isn't perfect and its system requirements are huge; but its accomplishments outweigh any reservations." [...] GameSpots review concluded with a similar summation. [...] "Morrowind does have numerous drawbacks .... But they're all generally minor enough that most anyone should be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> past them .... They'll otherwise find that Morrowind fulfills its many ambitious intentions. It's a beautiful-looking, sprawling, and completely open-ended game {{that allows you to}} play pretty much however you like".|$|E

He regularly works with his brother, Jonathan Nolan (creator of Person of Interest and Westworld), who describes their working relationship in the production notes for The Prestige: [...] "I've always suspected that {{it has something to}} do with the fact that he's left-handed and I'm right-handed, because he's somehow <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at my ideas and flip them around in a way that's just a little bit more twisted and interesting. It's great to be able to work with him like that". When working on separate projects the brothers always consult each other.|$|E
