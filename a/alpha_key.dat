40|$|This {{discussion}} paper argues {{that both the}} use of Cronbach’s alpha as a reliability estimate and {{as a measure of}} internal consistency suffer from major problems. First, alpha always has a value, which cannot be equal to the test score’s reliability given the interitem covariance matrix and the usual assumptions about measurement error. Second, in practice, alpha is used more often as a measure of the test’s internal consistency than as an estimate of reliability. However, it can be shown easily that alpha is unrelated to the internal structure of the test. It is further discussed that statistics based on a single test administration do not convey much information about the accuracy of individuals ’ test performance. The paper ends with a list of conclusions about the usefulness of <b>alpha.</b> <b>Key</b> words: Cronbach’s alpha, internal consistency, reliability, unidimensionality. 1...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{estrogen}} receptor alpha (ER <b>alpha)</b> is <b>key</b> {{in regulating}} normal breast development and function and is closely {{involved in the}} onset and progress of cancers. ER alpha transcriptional activity is mediated through two activation functions, AF 1 and AF 2, whose activity is tightly regulated in a cell-specific manner through yet unknown processes. Here, we demonstrate that cell-cell junctions generate cell permissiveness to AF 1 through an up-regulation of the activity of an AF 1 sub-region termed box 1. Moreover, the loss of E-cadherin expression is shown to silence the AF 1 activity of ER alpha, allowing the receptor to mainly act through its AF 2. This switch from an AF 1 to an AF 2 cell permissiveness also consequently results in the attenuation of ER alpha activity. Therefore, a loss of cell-cell junctions, a key process that occurs during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, should have a broad impact on ER alpha transcriptional functions...|$|R

We demonstrate that muscle-specific expression of PGC- 1 alpha improves the performance during voluntary as well as forced exercise challenges. Additionally, PGC- 1 alpha transgenic mice exhibit an enhanced performance during a peak oxygen uptake exercise test, demonstrating an increased peak oxidative capacity, or whole body oxygen uptake. This increased ability to perform in multiple exercise paradigms is supported by enhanced mitochondrial function as suggested by increased mitochondrial gene expression, mitochondrial DNA, and mitochondrial enzyme activity. Thus this study demonstrates that upregulation of PGC- 1 alpha in muscle in vivo is sufficient to greatly improve exercise performance under various exercise paradigms as well as increase peak oxygen uptake...|$|R

40|$|Insufficient {{oxygen and}} {{nutrient}} supply often restrain solid tumor growth, and the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) 1 alpha and HIF- 2 <b>alpha</b> are <b>key</b> transcription regulators of phenotypic adaptation to low oxygen levels. Moreover, mouse gene disruption studies have implicated HIF- 2 alpha in embryonic regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase, a hallmark gene of the sympathetic nervous system. Neuroblastoma tumors originate from immature sympathetic cells, {{and therefore we}} investigated the effect of hypoxia on the differentiation status of human neuroblastoma cells. Hypoxia stabilized HIF- 1 alpha and HIF- 2 alpha proteins and activated the expression of known hypoxia-induced genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and tyrosine hydroxylase. These changes in gene expression also occurred in hypoxic regions of experimental neuroblastoma xenografts grown in mice. In contrast, hypoxia decreased the expression of several neuronal/neuroendocrine marker genes but induced genes expressed in neural crest sympathetic progenitors, for instance c-kit and Notch- 1. Thus, hypoxia apparently causes dedifferentiation both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest a novel mechanism for selection of highly malignant tumor cells with stem-cell characteristics...|$|R
