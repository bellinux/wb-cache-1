5|$|The World Series {{started on}} a Tuesday for the second {{straight}} year, instead of a Wednesday <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> The practice was to avoid games on Thursday and Monday nights, generally big days of television viewing, where Fox's telecast would face stiff competition from Thursday Night Football, ESPN College Football Thursday Primetime, various popular primetime entertainment shows, and Monday Night Football.|$|E
5|$|The band {{continued}} to tour as a duo, with Linnell playing accordion and Flansburgh on guitars, or occasionally playing a marching band bass drum. Large posters of postage stamps adorned the stage as props; the minimal arrangement was {{received as a}} boldly simple choice. Sets included a combination {{of old and new}} material. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> the band was backed by a tape deck playing drum tracks or a metronome in lieu of a full rhythm section.|$|E
5|$|As the 1990s began, Pei transitioned into a role of {{decreased}} {{involvement with}} his firm. The staff {{had begun to}} shrink, and Pei wanted to dedicate himself to smaller projects allowing for more creativity. Before he made this change, however, he set {{to work on his}} last major project as active partner: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Considering his work on such bastions of high culture as the Louvre and US National Gallery, some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to low culture. The sponsors of the hall, however, sought Pei for specifically this reason; they wanted the building to have an aura of respectability from the beginning. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> Pei accepted the commission {{in part because of the}} unique challenge it presented.|$|E

5|$|Filipino and English are the {{official}} languages of the country. Filipino is a standardized version of Tagalog, spoken mainly in Metro Manila and other urban regions. Both Filipino and English {{are used in}} government, education, print, broadcast media, and business. In most towns, the local indigenous language is spoken. The Philippine constitution provides {{for the promotion of}} Spanish and Arabic on a voluntary and optional basis, although neither are used on as wide a scale <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Spanish, which was widely used as a lingua franca in the late nineteenth century, has since declined greatly in use, but is experiencing revival due to government promotions, while Arabic is mainly used in Islamic schools in Mindanao. However, Spanish loanwords are still present today in many of the indigenous Philippine languages.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 {{version of}} the All-Star Game {{featured}} {{a break from the}} traditional way in which teams were organized. Instead of using conferences or player nationalities <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> teams were selected by captains in a fantasy draft days prior to the game. Fans still elected players to the All-Star Game, but instead of the traditional 12 starters (six for each team), they elected only six players, with the remaining 36 players involved in the game selected by the NHL. Sidney Crosby received the most votes of any player, but due to a concussion he was unable to participate in the game. The participating players voted for team captains, selecting Nicklas Lidstrom of the Detroit Red Wings and Eric Staal of the Hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|With Ujung Kulon as {{the last}} resort of this species, all the Javan rhinos are in one location, an {{advantage}} over the Sumatran rhino which is dispersed in different, unconnected areas. However, this may also be disadvantageous to the Javan rhino population, because any catastrophic diseases or tsunamis could wipe them all out at once. Poaching for their horns is no longer as serious a threat <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> due to stricter international regulations on rhino horn, active protection efforts by local authorities, the rhinos' elusiveness and Ujung Kulon's remoteness. However, there are still obstacles to the species recovery. In 2012, the Asian Rhino Project was working out the best eradication programme for the arenga palm, which was blanketing the park and crowding out the rhinos' food sources. The banteng cattle also compete with the rhinos for food, so the authorities were considering plans to fence off {{the western part of}} the park to keep the livestock out.|$|E
