5|$|Afrasia {{is known}} from four {{isolated}} molar teeth {{found in the}} Pondaung Formation of Myanmar. These teeth <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Afrotarsius and Eosimiidae, and differ only in details of the chewing surface. For example, the back part of the third lower molar is relatively well-developed. In the Pondaung Formation, Afrasia {{was part of a}} diverse primate community that also includes the eosimiid Bahinia and members of the families Amphipithecidae and Sivaladapidae.|$|E
5|$|Elemental {{fluorine}} {{is highly}} toxic to living organisms. Its effects in humans start at concentrations lower than hydrogen cyanide's 50 ppm and <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> chlorine: significant irritation {{of the eyes}} and respiratory system as well as liver and kidney damage occur above 25 ppm, which is the immediately dangerous to life and health value for fluorine. Eyes and noses are seriously damaged at 100 ppm, and inhalation of 1,000 ppm fluorine will cause death in minutes, compared to 270 ppm for hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Awataguchi {{district}} of Kyoto, the Awataguchi school {{was active in}} the early and mid-Kamakura period. Leading members of the school were Kunitomo, whose tachi <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Sanjō Munechika, and Tōshirō Yoshimitsu, one of the most celebrated of all Japanese smiths. Yoshimitsu was the last of the significant smiths in the Awataguchi school, and the school was eventually replaced by the Rai school as the foremost school in Yamashiro Province.|$|E

5|$|Painted turtle pet-keeping {{requirements}} <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the red-eared slider. Keepers {{are urged}} {{to provide them with}} adequate space and a basking site, and water that is regularly filtered and changed. According to Petco, the animals are described as being somewhat unsuitable for children as they do not enjoy being held. Hobbyists have kept turtles alive for decades.|$|E
5|$|The D-shaped towers {{along the}} curtain wall <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> several other Saxon Shore forts, {{although}} their placement is somewhat unusual. Because the fort was partly surrounded by marshes and water, which provided natural defences, the Romans economised by only building towers {{on the more}} vulnerable north-eastern and far western sectors. The towers were probably used to mount artillery weapons such as catapults and heavy crossbows. Ten towers still survive, though there may originally have been more before {{the loss of the}} south wall.|$|E
5|$|The lungs of {{lungfish}} <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> amphibians, with few, if any, internal septa. In the Australian lungfish, {{there is}} only a single lung, albeit divided into two lobes. Other lungfish and Polypterus, however, have two lungs, which are located in {{the upper part of the}} body, with the connecting duct curving around and above the esophagus. The blood supply also twists around the esophagus, suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral part of the body, as in other vertebrates.|$|E

The level of chromium isotope 54Cr in Österplana 065 <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> in ordinary chondrites, while oxygen isotopes <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> in some rare primitive achondrites. Österplana 065 also features a chromium-spinel-rutile assemblage, not observed in other meteorites.|$|R

5|$|The pennies of King William IV (18301837) <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> his predecessor, {{also being}} {{engraved}} by William Wyon, {{based on a}} model by Sir Francis Chantrey. King William's head faces right, with the obverse inscribed GULIELMUS IIII DEI GRATIA, while the reverse {{is identical to the}} George IV penny. Pennies were minted in 1831, 1834 and 1837. An 1836 penny has been reported but not confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{safety issues}} for {{cryogenic}} helium <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> liquid nitrogen; its extremely low temperatures {{can result in}} cold burns, and the liquid-to-gas expansion ratio can cause explosions if no pressure-relief devices are installed. Containers of helium gas at 5 to 10 K should be handled as if they contain liquid helium due to the rapid and significant thermal expansion that occurs when helium gas at less than 10 K is warmed to room temperature.|$|E
5|$|Vision is an {{important}} sensory system for most species of fish. Fish eyes <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rods and cones (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment.|$|E

5|$|Charles {{suffered}} a sudden apoplectic {{fit on the}} morning of 2 February 1685, and died aged 54 at 11:45am four days later at Whitehall Palace. The suddenness of his illness and death led to suspicion of poison in the minds of many, including one of the royal doctors; however, a more modern medical analysis has held that the symptoms of his final illness <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> uraemia (a clinical syndrome due to kidney dysfunction). In the days between his collapse and his death, Charles endured a variety of torturous treatments including bloodletting, purging and cupping in hopes of effecting a recovery.|$|E
5|$|In the {{mandible}} (lower jaw), {{the upper}} and lower masseteric ridges come close together below the first molars, but do not fuse. The back end of the lower incisor root is in a capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone behind the molars. The upper incisors have yellowish enamel and are opisthodont, with the cutting edge inclined backwards. The molars are relatively small and are brachydont (low-crowned) and bunodont (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests). They <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the marsh rice rat in structural details. The upper and lower first molars have small accessory roots, as in many other oryzomyines, and the second and third lower molar each have two roots only.|$|E
5|$|One of the barrows (south {{of where}} the {{thatched}} barn now stands) contained a high status cremation of a woman of about twenty years in age, accompanied by an incense cup, a halberd-style pendant made from amber and copper alloy, and two gold cones that would have covered buttons of an organic material. The burial-goods recovered <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the Wessex culture, the Wilsford and Dorset Ridgeway series in particular. An urn {{from one of the}} barrows likely to have been made between 1700 and 1500 B.C., has been identified as Trevisker ware, a type widely found throughout Devon and Cornwall which was transported east in lesser amounts, this find being one of the easternmost discovered.|$|E

5|$|The {{color and}} general {{appearance}} of A.bisporigera <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> A.verna and A.virosa. A.bisporigera is at times {{smaller and more}} slender than either A.verna or A.virosa, but it varies considerably in size; therefore size is not a reliable diagnostic characteristic. A.virosa fruits in autumn—later than A.bisporigera. A.elliptosperma is less common but widely distributed in the southeastern United States, while A.ocreata is found on the West Coast and in the Southwest. Other similar toxic North American species include Amanita magnivelaris, which has a cream-colored, rather thick, felted-submembranous, skirt-like ring, and A.virosiformis, which has elongated spores that are 3.9–4.7 by 11.7–13.4μm. Neither A.elliptosperma nor A.magnivelaris typically turn yellow with the application of KOH; the KOH reaction of A.virosiformis has not been reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{flora and}} fauna of Stroma <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the mainland. The island is treeless; its {{vegetation}} consists primarily of grasses, heather and small flowers. Seals are plentiful along its shores and are sometimes found inland during the breeding season. Both grey seals and harbour seals are present, with around 650 grey seal pups being born each year. Otters may also be present, as {{in other parts of}} mainland Caithness. The western cliffs are the site of colonies of terns, guillemots, fulmars and eider ducks. The cliffs are designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest within the North Caithness Cliffs Special Protection Area. The waters off Stroma support a number of cetacean species including minke whale, white-beaked dolphin and harbour porpoise.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{sketches}} {{the natural}} history of the islands to the West of the Wallace line, noting that the flora is like that of India, as described by the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker in his 1855 Flora Indica. Similarly the mammals <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> India, including the tiger, leopard, rhinoceros and elephant. The bird species had diverged, but the genera were mainly the same, and some species of (for example) woodpecker, parrot, kingfisher and pheasant were found from India to Java and Borneo, while many more were found both in Sumatra and the Malay peninsula.|$|E
