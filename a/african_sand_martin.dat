50|$|The nest is a loose ball {{assembled}} from {{grass and}} feathers. A nest may {{be built on}} branches, or in the crown of palm trees, or in tree hollows. The birds also use cavities in buildings, and the old nests of the Ethiopian swallow and <b>African</b> <b>sand</b> <b>martin.</b> They have been observed once removing nestlings of the <b>African</b> <b>sand</b> <b>martin</b> to take over their nests. A clutch contains three to six eggs. They are white with brown and gray spots. The breeding season falls in Eritrea during January to March and May to November, in Ethiopia breeding may occur from April to December.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{data on the}} {{distribution}} of birds in the Cape Verde Islands are presented, including records of six species new to the archipelago, viz. Pintail Anas acuta, Least Sandpiper Calidris minutilla, Snipe Gallinago gallinago, Red-rumped Swallow Hirundo daurica, <b>African</b> <b>Sand</b> <b>Martin</b> Riparia paludicola, and Song Thrush Turdus philomelos. Also included are data on extentions in range and time within the islands of migrant visitors as well as observations of rare and threatened resident species. Extralimital records of migrant Cape Verde seabirds are summarized and news and views relating to the conservation of threatened endemic taxa are discussed. In addition, some recent studies bearing on the systematics of endemic Procellarids are reviewed...|$|E
50|$|The {{rock martin}} is much drabber than most African swallows, and {{confusion}} is unlikely except with other crag <b>martins</b> or with <b>sand</b> <b>martins</b> {{of the genus}} Riparia. The pale crag martin is smaller, paler and greyer than its southern relative. Although only slightly larger than the <b>sand</b> <b>martin</b> and brown-throated <b>sand</b> <b>martin,</b> the rock martin is more robust, has white tail spots, and lacks a breast band. It is paler on the throat, breast and underwings than the all-dark form of the brown-throated <b>sand</b> <b>martin.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>sand</b> <b>martin</b> (Riparia riparia) or European <b>sand</b> <b>martin,</b> {{bank swallow}} in the Americas, and {{collared}} <b>sand</b> <b>martin</b> in the Indian Subcontinent, is a migratory passerine {{bird in the}} swallow family. It has a wide range in summer, embracing {{practically the whole of}} Europe and the Mediterranean countries, part of northern Asia and also North America.

5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} is much drabber than most African swallows, and {{confusion}} is unlikely except with other crag <b>martins</b> or with <b>sand</b> <b>martins</b> {{of the genus}} Riparia. It is 15% smaller, paler and greyer than the Eurasian crag martin, and has smaller tail spots. It is smaller, paler, and has a more contrasting throat than the rock martin. In the far east of its range, the pale crag martin always has lighter underparts than the dusky crag martin. Although only slightly larger than the <b>sand</b> <b>martin</b> and brown-throated <b>sand</b> <b>martin,</b> the pale crag martin is more robust, has white tail spots, and lacks a breast band. Separation of similar species in flight may be complicated by the difficulty of judging colours accurately in strong desert light, particularly with juveniles. The fast flight of the brown-throated <b>sand</b> <b>martin</b> also makes identification more difficult.|$|R

40|$|The {{breeding}} and feeding {{ecology of the}} Swallow, Hirundo rustica, and the <b>Sand</b> <b>Martin,</b> R. riparia, in Central Scotland is described, with particular reference to the constraints imposed by environmental conditions. The time and energy investment in reproduction was examined for all stages of the breeding season {{in a wide variety}} of environmental conditions. Brood sizes were manipulated to change the investment of each parent in the brood. The D 2018 technique was used to measure flight costs (0. 0848 kcal g-l h- 1 for the Swallow, 0. 1288 kcal g-l h- 1 for the <b>Sand</b> <b>Martin)</b> and the rate at which each species collected food under a variety of conditions was examined (mean values were 0. 14 assimilable kcal min- 1 for the Swallow, 0. 05 assimilable kcal min- 1 for the <b>Sand</b> <b>Martin).</b> These data, along with measurements of the nestlings' daily energy requirements, were used to investigate energy balance and the consequences for the timing and level of each breeding attempt. It is suggested that the Swallow lays later than the <b>Sand</b> <b>Martin</b> because (a) it takes larger insects and does not lay until these become abundant and (b) the female Swallow incubates alone whereas both <b>Sand</b> <b>Martin</b> sexes incubate, hence the Swallow defers laying until the risk of encountering bad weather during incubation is low.

5000|$|Linnaeus already {{remarked on}} this species' {{breeding}} habits: Habitat in Europae collibus arenosis abruptis, foramine serpentino - [...] "it lives in Europe, in winding holes in sheer sandy hills". It {{has been observed}} that <b>sand</b> <b>martins</b> favour loess as {{a particular type of}} ground to nest in. <b>Sand</b> <b>martins</b> are generally found near larger bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes or even the ocean, throughout the year.|$|R
5|$|These drab martins {{can only}} be {{confused}} with each other, or with <b>sand</b> <b>martins</b> of the genus Riparia. Even the smaller Ptyonoprogne species are slightly larger and more robust than the <b>sand</b> <b>martin</b> and brown-throated <b>sand</b> <b>martin,</b> and have the white tail spots which are absent from the Riparia martins. Where the ranges of Ptyonoprogne species overlap, the Eurasian crag martin is darker, browner and 15% larger than the rock martin, and larger and paler, particularly on its underparts, than the dusky crag martin. The white tail spots of the Eurasian crag martin are significantly larger than those of both its relatives. In the east of its range, the rock martin always has lighter, more contrasted underparts than the dusky crag martin.|$|R
