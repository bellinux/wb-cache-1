5|$|Male adults may patrol individually, {{but most}} congregate in swarms a few metres above water with clear open sky above it, and perform a nuptial (courtship) dance. Each insect has a {{characteristic}} up-and-down pattern of movement; strong wingbeats propel it upwards and forwards with the tail sloping down; when it stops moving its wings, it falls passively with the abdomen tilted upwards. Females fly into these swarms, and mating {{takes place in}} the air. A rising male clasps the thorax of a female from below using his front legs bent upwards, and inseminates her. Copulation may last just a few seconds, but occasionally a pair remains in tandem and flutters to the ground. Males may spend the night in vegetation and return to the nuptial dance the following day. Although they do not feed, some briefly touch the surface to drink <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>water</b> before flying off.|$|E
25|$|The rise of {{the river}} was {{unprecedented}} and many residents did not evacuate, which led to 35 casualties. The Army {{was called in to}} assist in the cleanup. The flood damage was so severe that the area that was flooded along Raymore Drive ceased to be a residential area and became a park. In contrast, some homes on the street that were a little higher and farther away merely received <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>water</b> in the basement.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent a}} mask from fogging up due to {{condensation}} {{on the glass}} many divers spit into the dry mask before use, spread the saliva around {{the inside of the}} plate and rinse it out with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>water.</b> The saliva residue allows condensation to wet the glass and form a continuous film, rather than form droplets. There are commercial products that can be used {{as an alternative to the}} saliva method, some of which are more effective and last longer.|$|E

25|$|Purple laver (Porphyra) {{is perhaps}} the most widely domesticated marine algae. In Asia it is used in nori (Japan) and gim (Korea). In Wales, it is used in laverbread, a {{traditional}} food, and in Ireland it is collected and made into a jelly by stewing or boiling. Preparation also can involve frying or heating the fronds with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>water</b> and beating with a fork to produce a pinkish jelly. Harvesting also occurs along the west coast of North America, and in Hawaii and New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Masks tend to fog when warm humid {{exhaled air}} {{condenses}} {{on the cold}} inside of the faceplate. To prevent fogging many divers spit into the dry mask before use, spread the saliva around {{the inside of the}} glass and rinse it out with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>water.</b> The saliva residue allows condensation to wet the glass and form a continuous film, rather than tiny droplets. There are several commercial products that can be used as an alternative to saliva, some of which are more effective and last longer, but there is a risk of getting the anti-fog agent in the eyes.|$|E

Leno spent {{several months in}} Camberwell House Asylum, London, {{under the care of}} Dr. Savage, who treated Leno with [...] "peace and quiet and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>water</b> colouring". On his second day, Leno told a nurse that the clock was wrong. When she stated that it was right, Leno remarked, [...] "Well if it's right, then what's it doing here?" [...] Leno made several attempts to leave the asylum, twice being successful. He was found each time and promptly returned.|$|E

Her method was to look up words, read newspapers and note words she had heard in the street.|$|R

Contrariwise, he who has no good deeds even though he has studied much Torah — to whom may he be compared? To a man who in building lays bricks first and then heaps stones over them, so that even if <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>water</b> collects, it at once undermines the structure.|$|E

2500|$|Parākramabāhu I (Pali Mahā Parākaramabāhu 1123–1186) {{was king}} of the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa from 1153-86. During his reign from {{the capital city of}} Polonnaruwa, he unified the three lesser kingdoms of the island, {{becoming}} one of the last monarchs in Sri Lankan history to do so. He oversaw the expansion and beautification of his capital, constructed extensive irrigation systems, reorganized the country's army, reformed Buddhist practices, encouraged the arts and undertook military campaigns in South India and Burma. The adage [...] "not even <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>water</b> that comes from the rain must flow into the ocean without being made useful to man" [...] is one of his most famous utterances.|$|E
2500|$|The hull was flat-sided and deep. Its {{underside}} had two steps; {{in front}} of the first the hull bottom was a hollow V in section and behind it a flat V. There was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>water</b> rudder behind the rear step. Pilot and mechanic sat side-by-side in an open cockpit, with gunner's positions ahead of them and at the trailing edge. [...] Alternatively, the Robbe could be configured to carry four passengers, one in a forward cabin, two in a central one and one more im a rear cabin, or to carry goods or post. The hull was divided into seven watertight compartments to preserve buoyancy. An unusual feature of each gunner's cockpit was a duralumin, telescopic mast. If, in an emergency the Robbe alighted without power, these could each be extended and a simple, triangular sail raised to reach safety. [...] At the rear the tail was conventional, with a blunted rectangular fin and small unbalanced rudder. The high aspect ratio horizontal tail, again rectangular apart from blunted tips, was mounted well up the fin and strut-braced to the upper fuselage. Like the rudder, the elevators were unbalanced.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mechanism}} was operated {{from the}} top level. For a descent, the box was first wound into its upper position using a double rack-and-pinion mechanism, then drawn tightly against {{the frame of the}} opening using a ratchet mounted {{on the top of the}} wall. The outer door was then drawn up with another rack-and-pinion. At this point the water levels in the top pound and inside the box would have been roughly equal, but as the inner door [...] – the box door – swung outwards horizontally (like a normal single lock gate) it would not open if the outer level was to any extent higher. A small equalising cock was therefore provided. The door was opened, the boat was floated in, the doors closed and the ratchet released. Because the entering boat would displace its weight of water back into the pound, the total weight of the box was always the same and no great endeavour was needed to wind it up and down. However, the operators could release <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>water</b> into the box to assist the descent. Water pressure against the outward-opening doors kept them firmly closed and watertight.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), the servant took Abraham's bounty and ten of Abraham's camels and {{traveled}} to Aram-Naharaim, {{the city of}} Nahor. He made the camels kneel by the well outside the city at evening, when women come out to draw water. The servant asked God to grant that the maiden whom he would ask to draw water for him and who replied by offering also to water his camels might be the one whom God had decreed for Isaac. He had scarcely finished speaking when Rebekah, the beautiful virgin daughter of Abraham's nephew Bethuel, came out with her jar on her shoulder, {{went down to the}} spring, filled her jar, and came up. The servant ran toward her and asked to sip <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>water</b> from her jar, and she quickly let him drink and when he had drunk his fill, she offered to draw water for his camels until they finish drinking. When the camels had finished drinking, the servant took a gold nose-ring and two gold bands for her arms, and asked her whose daughter she was and whether there was room in her father's house for him to spend the night. She identified herself and told him that there was plenty of straw and feed and room at her home for him to spend the night. The servant bowed low to God. The third reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
