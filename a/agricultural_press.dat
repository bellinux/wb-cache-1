The cause of the foundation of an <b>agricultural</b> <b>press</b> {{is the same as}} with all other special publications. There is always a demand before such a journal is founded. We often hear the statement that the mission of the agricultural paper is to educate the farmers, but we may feel sure that no one has taken such a duty upon himself until the farmer has desired to be educated.

40|$|Maintaining high {{standards}} {{is essential in}} the <b>press,</b> <b>agricultural</b> versions included. Harvests, incomes, communities, sectors, animals, ecosystems, national economies and more all depend on them. That credo of reliability overrides any of the temptations of prepared stories, per diems or sheer laziness that sometimes dangle {{in front of a}} weary or weak writer. As well as general principles, each sector or publication has its own codes. Spore writers, for example, are implored to use six senses in researching stories, to triple-check references and to treat a press release as a possible point of departure for a story and not as a model of the final text. That the founders of the World Summit Task Force of Agricultural Media Professionals (see Spore 101) made such ethics a cornerstone of their policies suggests room for professional improvement here.

40|$|M. Tech. Architecture (Professional) At {{present the}} South African olive oil {{industry}} is {{highly dependent on}} international imports due to local olive oil producers being unable to meet the local demand. The need for {{extra virgin olive oil}} has increased each year since people have become more aware of the health benefits of the product. This dissertation documents the design of an olive oil production facility near the foothills of the Draaiberg mountain range in the Touws River valley. Situated in close proximity to the Touws River railway station, the proposed architectural intervention responds to the current situation of neglected railway towns through the implementation of agri-tourism in the area. Public interest creates a platform for the market to educate the broader public about health benefits, which has caused a gradual, growth in the olive oil industry. This in turn shows that olive oil farms need a public interface, such as an information centre, a shop and tasting room to entice the consumer and create awareness of the quality level of olive oil South Africa has to offer. The aim of this thesis is to design an olive oil production facility, focusing on the production of extra virgin olive oil and relevant alternative products. The facility will not only function as an <b>agricultural</b> olive <b>press</b> for a private farming concern, but will also act as a community press facility to allow for continuous growth in the olive industry. One of the design objectives is to create a space for information and social interaction. The main building's size is informed {{by the size of the}} productive landscape and formulas were used to calculate the volume of oil produced per hectare. The production process can be followed by the visitor, giving rise to a linear building typology...|$|R

Cilj ovogodišnjih radova bio je nastavak iskopavanja te povezivanja i dokumentiranja već djelomično istraženih, kasnoantičkih prostora u gospodarskom dijelu vile. Unutar katastarskih čestica 4318 i 4319 postavljene su, i istražene dvije sonde, S 17 i S 18. Pokretni nalazi i ostaci arhitekture ukazuju na višefaznu gradnju. Brojne kockice mozaika u svim slojevima i znatni ulomci polikromnih zidnih freski u slojevima urušenja nađeni su u nastavku prostorija istraživanih u 2014., što opet ukazuje na stambene prostore, vjerojatno iz ranije faze gradnje. The tenth {{season of}} the {{international}} and interdisciplinary investigations of the Roman villa in Soline Bay on Sv. Klement near Hvar took place in June 2016. The objective was to continue the excavation of the production area of the villa. Two probes were excavated {{to the north and}} west of the standing wall B. Probe 17 had 9 stratigraphic units of soil layers and no architectural remains. It confirmed that there were no built spaces west of the perimeter wall documented in the previous seasons. Probe 18 contained another segment of this perimeter wall (SU 18005), which still continued north, outside the probe. Other architectureal remains in probe 18 confirmed at least two building phases and showed that production spaces extended to the north and east. A round structure SU 18011, built of rough-cut stone set in thick lime mortar (diameter 2 m) could have been a base of some <b>agricultural</b> structure (<b>press?).</b> It was adjacent to (and functionally connected with?) the basin with a floor in opus signinum and an imbedded stone bowl, uncovered in 2015. Under the round structure was a floor SU 18012, made of fine mortar with sand and small stones, which belonged to an earlier building phase and was associated with the wall SU 18005 and a perpendicular wall SU 18009. Another wall SU 18014 was parallel with wall 18005 and abutted the western wall of the basin. It could have been added to reinforce that wall. A very large number of white limestone tesserae of various sizes were found in both probes, but only one fresco fragment. Earlier residential spaces were perhaps repurposed for production functions. The ceramic finds included very few fragments of Hellenistic and early imperial ware in addition to late Roman African and Phocaean sigillata, Aegean and African kitchen ware and amphorae. There were also several fragments of ceramic beehives. The most significant was the find of an almost complete amphora in situ by the eastern face of wall SU 18005. Among the metal finds, there were 3 bronze coins and one small bronze plate, perhaps part of a belt buckle. The structures related to agricultural production and the ceramic finds indicate the economic, navigational and strategic role of this villa in the Mediterranean exchange...|$|R

40|$|On December 10 th 2003 a {{regulation}} was adopted which allows EU {{member states to}} grant various types of state aid without the prior clearance of the Commission. This is designed {{to speed up the}} implementation of new state aids in the agricultural sector. A Commission press release maintains that the new regulation ‘will not soften the state-aid rule' and ‘will not allow state aid in areas considered incompatible with the internal market'. The same rules will continue to apply throughout the EU. The modification will require member states to strengthen their post-fact reporting of state aid. To ensure full transparency, all exempted state aid (state aid not requiring prior Commission approval) will be published on the internet. The proposed regulation covers state aid granted to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the agricultural sector. Due to the definition of SMEs used – up to 250 employees, a turnover of € 40 million or a € 27 million balance sheet – the rules cover almost all farms and companies active in the <b>agricultural</b> sector. The <b>press</b> release sets out the types and levels of aid subject to the new regulation. The areas covered include: aid to on-farm investment; aid to investment in agro-processing; aid to conservation of traditional landscapes; aid to relocation of farm buildings in the public interest; aid to young farmers; aid for early retirement; aid for the establishment of producer groups; aid with insurance premiums; aid for land reparcelling; aid for the production and marketing of quality products; aid for technical support; aid to the livestock sector. The new regulation will remain in force until the end of 2006.

40|$|Jean-Marie Samuel Ouenabio Jean-Marie Samuel Ouenabio Is an African Journalist who {{has chosen}} to work among the 'poor relations' of his trade: science and development. He was born in 1957, and is today {{in charge of the}} science {{magazine}} on the Congolese radio. He also edils the science page of a national daily paper, {{and is one of the}} correspondents for SYFIA (Syst? Francophone d'lnformation Agricole). The Congo is one of those countries which have known a period of prosperity from oil but which remain essentially agricultural. The media boomed overnight, but then the bubble burst. What is left today? As a specialist, Jean-Marie Samuel Ouenabio, looks at the balance sheet, and finds that - despite heavy losses - STI (scientific and technical information) is alive and well, and will continue to flourish if only it can receive regular injections of information from the outside world. Can the media establish links between the urban and the rural communities? The Congo, like most developing countries, is divided between the rural areas, where most people still live and where traditional ways predominate, and the urban centres which are open to outside influences and more advanced techniques, The Congo has a wider range of information media than elsewhere in Africa, even though these may sometimes be of doubtful quality. The field of agricultural information reflects this town-country dichotomy in the difference between the educated and the rural public, and between the traditional press and electronic media. The poor relation - the agricultural review The poorest of them all is 'Echo rural', a sporadic duplicated bulletin, edited in French by five rural development specialists. It is intended as an educational aid which will raise consciousness among rural communities and help popularize ideas and techniques. 'Echo rural' is published by the press section of the Rural Radio project, but its run has steadily decreased (from 1000 copies at the beginning to 500 today). It may now cease publication completely since Rural Radio finance has been withdrawn by the German Friedrich Naumann Foundation. Still fresh in people's memory is 'Sengo' which was launched in 1972 and ceased publication in 1979. 'Sengo' had a run of 6000 and sold for 100 francs CFA. It aimed at training people to put new agricultural techniques into practice and endeavoured to eliminate illiteracy in French, providing teaching materials for the education of the rural population. Unfortunately it ended after only seven years because of technical, financial and sociopolitical factors. Radio is the most popular medium Rural radio, which is seen as a support for educational and extension programmes among peasant communities, must involve a large measure of collaboration between radio staff and extension officers. Rural radio enjoys considerable popularity which it puts to good use when its staff venture into the country areas to set up discussions with smallholder farmers and training personnel. They also come back with a rich harvest of sound recordings. As well as these reports, rural radio - which broadcasts four hours a day at peak times in French and the two national languages - puts out a varied diet of programmes: training, education, rural promotion, and mini-programmes. In the two pilot zones of the Rural Radio project, people listen to programmes in radio clubs with a leader and a technical adviser, but now the financial backing has been withdrawn, its future is in jeopardy. Agriculture does better In the popular <b>press</b> <b>Agricultural</b> topics are regularly aired in the popular press. Unlike many African countries, the Congo considers agriculture to be of topical interest, and the powers-that-be are forever extolling the virtues of working the land. Agricultural topics receive lively coverage from specialist journalists on TV, national radio, and the daily newspaper 'Mweti'. As well as the rural radio broadcasts, a farming slot has recently been allocated on the radio and TV science magazines. Although most of this information is domestic, our journalists open their columns and their air-waves to what is happening - both good and bad - in neighbouring countries, in the Tropics in general and elsewhere. The traditional sources of information agencies, scientific press services and news releases from specialist organizations - are all put to maximum use. The journalists on 'Science Magazine' (radio and TV) have more opportunity than others to work 'on the ground'- getting first-hand material, doing interviews with scientists and meeting 'developers'. This particular broadcast receives support from the Ministry of Research and the Environment But demand for material is such that we are always on the look-out for up-to-date in-depth information, which is better suited to our audience and its needs, more objective, more regular- and more 'African'. The media also needs a bit more continuity - to be given the assurance of long-term funding. Perhaps legislation could be passed to this effect. In order to create new agricultural traditions, the Congo must have an efficient means of informing its young peasant farmers, its training personnel, its scientists and developers. This is the public it must aim to reach. Also, all possible sources of information must be exploited to the full. This means that all the services involved in development must become more open and break down barriers between one another. We must also open up to the outside world. The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily those of CTA [...] Jean-Marie Samuel Ouenabio Jean-Marie Samuel Ouenabio Is an African Journalist who {{has chosen to}} work among the 'poor relations' of his trade: science and development.

By tracing {{the ways in which}} tourism development both centralizes the necessity of modernizing rural regions for {{the nation as a whole}} while simultaneously emphasizing the otherness of rural communities in order to promote them as tourist attractions, I seek to understand how the rural appears in Chinese tourism as a central concern of the state, and yet the approach of development programs has been to characterize what is rural as evermore different and distant in order to satisfy perceived tourist desires. The focus of the chapter is the examination of two publications that deal specifically with the formation, significance, and regulation of ‘the rural’ in tourism development: a widely circulated statement from 2006 by the chairman of the China National Tourism Administration, Shao Qiwei, and a guidebook on operating rural tourism businesses by the China <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Press.</b> My analysis considers the practices and ideas suggested by these publications in light of ethnographic observations from two rural ethnic tourism villages...|$|E

It uniquely surveys the impact of these changing dynamics of management through four broadly defined themes. Firstly it examines the concept of the patriotic landowner {{and the ways in which}} this affected farming practice. Secondly it investigates the characteristics of the expanding <b>agricultural</b> <b>press</b> and questions whether this corpus of knowledge contributed to professionalisation. Thirdly it considers the factors which contributed to the changing face of land management including: mechanisation, scientific farming, and agricultural experimentation, the dissemination of knowledge through agricultural shows and societies and increasing legislation. Fourthly it studies how changes within the landscape impacted on estate management and the ways in which this changed the characteristics of estate management. This is the first detailed micro-study relating to the changing dynamics of professionalisation. Previous studies have lacked detail or depth. The diary of William Gould and the correspondence of William Cripwell both agents at Welbeck form the basis of this study and create a historical perspective which is missing from the limited amount of previous research into this subject. Despite the lack of formalised training, by the beginning of the twentieth century the land agent was classed as a professional and this thesis for the first time starts to provide the answers as to why and how this change occurred...|$|E

40|$|Preface] Australian aboriginals are {{hunters and}} gatherers. There was no {{agriculture}} in Australia {{prior to the}} arrival of the first European settlers in 1788. Since then, in a short history of a little over 220 years, Australian farmers have advanced Australian agriculture from non-existence to where it is now: one of the most advanced and efficient in the world. What has driven Australian agriculture to advance so fast? What are the experiences and lessons from Australia's agricultural development? Could such experiences and lessons be of value to help China further its agricultural development? These questions have always fascinated me and I often try to relate Australia's agricultural practice to that of China or the other way around. However, although I have lived and worked in Australia for almost 30 years, I have not spent much time examining Australia's agricultural development in a systematic manner and relate it back to that of China. I have largely focused my research work on China's agricultural development and have only written a couple of articles about Australian agriculture and its relevance to China. In early April 2009, I received an email from Mr Wenwu Ke, Director of Agricultural Economics Division of China <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Press</b> in Beijing. Wenwu told me that China <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Press</b> was going to publish a book series on foreign agriculture for readers in China and asked me if I could write the book on Australian agriculture. This was a great opportunity that would force me to examine Australia's agricultural development in a more systematic way. Hence, I happily accepted this request. China's achievements in agricultural growth and progress have been most remarkable in the past three decades. I believe that there is still potential for China's agriculture to grow. However, it is noted that in past years, various problems, some being very serious, concerning China's agriculture have emerged, such as resource damage, environmental pollution, unsafe food and disputes over land use. Such problems, to a large extent, have hindered further agricultural development in China. To resolve these problems, more institutional reforms and innovations are needed. Looking beyond the limited confines of one's own nation can help seeking new solutions to old problems by comparing one's own practices with those used elsewhere. Australia's key experience in successfully developing its agriculture is to establish institutional arrangements conducive to agricultural development and constantly explore ways to improve such arrangements. Australia's experience can be of great relevance to China's future agricultural development. The major motivation for me to write this book is to introduce Australia's agricultural development experiences in a more systematic way to those who are engaged in, or care about, China's agricultural development. Major readers include (1) government officials and researchers who are engaged in agricultural planning, policy making and development; (2) university students, both undergraduates and postgraduates, who study issues concerning China's agricultural development and are interested in looking into Australia's experiences; and (3) consultants of agricultural consulting companies. In addition, those who are interested in investing in Australian agriculture will find this book valuable to help them understand Australian agriculture. At the time when I accepted the task to write this book, I was quite confident about accomplishing it. This is simply because of the following fact. Due to my personal interest in agricultural issues, I always pay much attention to what is happening in Australian agriculture. I take any opportunities to interact with those who are engaged in Australian agriculture, including farmers, government officials, agricultural traders, agricultural consultants, teaching staff and students of agricultural colleges, and agricultural researchers. Also, I came to Australia to reside soon after the large-scale agricultural reforms started in Australia, which has allowed me the opportunity to observe the reforming process over the past years. As such, I thought I knew a fair bit about Australian agriculture. Surprisingly, soon after I started my serious writing, I found that I did not know as much about Australian agriculture as I had previously perceived. No choice, other than that I had to learn more. Fortunately, many of those industry contacts I had came to my rescue. They helped me enormously to quickly grasp many important issues related to Australian agriculture. They also helped to introduce me to many other industry personnel. Due to their genuine assistance, it was possible for me to have extensive and in-depth discussions and exchanges with farmers, researchers; traders, industry leaders and government officials in all states and territories. These visits also gave me the opportunity to inspect farm fields, trading facilities, research laboratories and so on. Such personal interactions and field inspections greatly improved my understanding of Australian agriculture. My university, James Cook University, provided generous support and assistance for my research work. To enable me to travel to different states and territories to visit industry personnel, my university granted me a Special Studies Leave {{in the second half of}} 2010. Both my university and Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC) provided me with financial assistance for my field work...|$|E
40|$|We, in agriculture, {{shall not}} be where we must without {{the passion of the}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>press</b> of ACP countries. Read all about it. The end of the month is always a {{critical}} time in farming. It's the time to review sowing campaigns, check forage stocks, plan weeding, maintain tools and machines. Much depends on the weather, and on whether such inputs as fuels, fertiliser and cash are obtainable, all of them having become less reliable - with some believing that even the climate has been given a dose of structural adjustment, so variable has it become! Depending {{on the nature of the}} agricultural business, salaries and bills are due to be paid, reports written, funding proposals delivered, even tax or insurance forms completed. All in all, a familiar pattern, shaped by deep-rooted farmer savvy and by bureaucracy, and often recorded in those little diaries known as farmers' almanacs. Many drums, one beat The same regularity, quarterly, monthly, weekly or even daily, dominates the life of a newspaper or magazine publisher. This holds whether you're in charge of a community broadsheet, or one of the recently emerged papers in many an ACP country which have been welcomed as flag-bearers of plurality and press freedom. And it also holds for the new wave of farmers' magazines sweeping through our rural landscapes. Take the case of The Farmer's Voice (see Spore 101), the Cameroonian monthly which is a role model for many agricultural newspapers. In the last week of each month, the editors of the French and English editions get together with the publisher and editor-in-chief, in their orderly and none-too-spacious offices in central Yaoundé, the nation's capital. So it was with their meeting at the end of February 2003. They reviewed last-minute adjustments to the layout and content of the March issue. Then they turned their minds to the April issue; they finalised stories; they selected as many readers' letters as they could; they discussed the impact of a recent Spore article about their Website; and they caught up on the report about the distribution of the February edition (see yellow box). Similar scenes take place in the editorial offices of hundreds of agricultural periodicals across the globe, be it the editorial conference of the daily agricultural bulletin in Suva, Fiji, or Spore's own bi-monthly committee, described in Spore 99 and 101 respectively. Or the monthly sessions of the new Farmers' Monthly magazine, striving to develop a niche in South Africa's new sector of emerging farmers. Whose news? How much are they all one of a kind, these newspapers and magazines? Some belong to a particular sector, such as CitriNews of the Citrus Growers Association of Belize or the well-endowed and colourful Horticulture in Malawi magazine. A few, such as The African Farmer and Benin's monthly Agri-Culture, are explicitly commercial, struggling to stay above the break-even point in a fragile market. The standard model of an ACP farmers' magazine is not just about farming but about rural life and environments in general. An example is Communautés Africaines, published by the APICA NGO enterprise in Douala, Cameroon (again!), and approaching its third decade as a newsletter about small-scale agricultural technologies, with handy hints for improving village infrastructures in water supply, lighting or education. It has never erred from the classical model of a simple standard design, once typed but now produced using simple desk-top publishing software. The AgriPromo bulletins of INADES-Formation in Côte d'Ivoire and Ecoforum from the Environment Liaison Centre International in Kenya have shown similar staying power. They are all driven by a service attitude, with an almost evangelical fervour, and external funding. The most recent wave of publications has come from the now ubiquitous federations of farmers' organisations (FFO), typified by La voix des producteurs, produced by the Fédération des unions des producteurs du Bénin (FUPRO). They carry an FFO's multiple burdens, with an esoteric mix of market information, crop guidelines and reports on changes in the organisation. The same mixture is found in Ground-Up which promotes the messages of the Participatory Ecological Land-Use Management (PELUM) Association, a network of 130 FFOs and other civil society bodies in southern Africa. As these federations grow into their multi-task roles of being service-provider in the village and field, and representative in local and national political fora, they will no doubt separate the institutional from the technical in their range of publications. These are best kept apart. Do you believe? What keeps these publications going? Faith, faith, and more faith. Their financial viability is their weakest point but the demand, if not a paying market, is strong. The sums are simple enough: major income does not come from sales, but from grants, loans and increasingly advertising. In a measured way, this is the only way to keep income at a level that will allow investment in new production technology, in the crucial distribution chain and in sustainable staffing. Information is in better supply, in part through sharing news through the Internet. The transformation of information into knowledge is a skill that will develop as training in agricultural journalism and professional networks grow. As the mighty World Association of Newspapers is expected to conclude at its June 2003 meeting in Ireland on 'Strengthening the Future of Newspapers', the viability of any newspaper will depend on its ability to develop additional information services and use new media. Then it will thrive. And in the brittle world of agricultural periodicals in ACP countries, thrive they must. When Spore interviewed the editor of The Farmer's Voice for this article, the talk was not about the newspaper's image or its editorial process. We talked for hours about how it is used by readers as a forum to settle, or record the settling of, the occasional tensions and stresses that are inevitable in the dynamics of local development initiatives. When readers make a mediator of the press, the publishers must make sure they stay in business. Without the impassioned engagement of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>press</b> of the ACP countries, agriculture will not arrive where we want to carry out it...|$|E
