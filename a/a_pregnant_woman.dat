5|$|The Buddhist {{version of}} the Bhasmasura tale {{continues}} with Shiva (Ishvara) asking the female-Vishnu, who is seated on a swing, to marry him. She asks Shiva to get the permission of his wife Umayangana to take her home. Shiva returns with Umayangana's consent to find the female-Vishnu pregnant, who sends him back to get permission to bring <b>a</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> home. When he returns, a child is born and female-Vishnu is pregnant again. She requests Shiva to seek approval to bring <b>a</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> with a child home. This happens six more times. Finally, Shiva brings Umayangana with him to witness the miraculous woman. Vishnu then returns to his male form. Umayangana embraces the six youngest children merging them into the six-headed Skanda, while the eldest, named Aiyanayaka ("eldest brother") remains intact. Aiyanayaka is identified with Aiyanar.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{shooting}} of the film began, Vidya started to use a prosthetic belly to look as close to authentically pregnant as possible. According to news reports, she met doctors and pregnant women {{to learn about the}} typical lifestyle and nuances of <b>a</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman,</b> and also made lists of rules and superstitions followed by pregnant women. Vidya said that during her college days she often used to imitate pregnant ladies during stand-up acting among friends, an experience that helped her during {{the shooting}}.|$|E
5|$|In late October and November 1860, Comanches led by Peta Nocona {{conducted}} numerous {{raids on}} various settlements, {{culminating in the}} brutal killing of <b>a</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman.</b> On hearing of these incidents, Houston sent several 25-man companies to assist Ross. A citizen's posse had tracked the raiders to their winter village along the Pease River. As the village contained at least 500 warriors and many women and children, the posse returned to the settlements to recruit additional fighters. Ross requested help from the U.S. Army at Camp Cooper, which sent 21 troops.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{documented}} {{cases of}} postmortem fetal extrusion were {{described in the}} medical compendium Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine, first published in 1896. The earliest presented case occurred in 1551 when <b>a</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> was tried and hanged by the courts of the Spanish Inquisition. Four hours after her death, and while the body still hung by the neck, two dead infants were seen to fall free of the body. This is unusual for the {{short amount of time}} elapsed between death and the postmortem delivery. As no information is given regarding other ambient circumstances, it is unclear whether the onset of putrefaction was accelerated, or if other causal factors were at work. In the city of Brussels, in 1633, a woman died in convulsions and three days later the fetus was spontaneously expelled. In Weissenfels, in 1861, postmortem fetal extrusion was observed sixty hours after the death of <b>a</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman.</b> Other cases are described, though only a few describe the unexpected discovery of fetal remains following exhumation. Most cases occurred prior to burial; in some of these, the body was in the casket while in other cases the body was still on its deathbed or on a bier.|$|E
5|$|Cases {{have been}} {{recorded}} by medical authorities since the 16th century, though some archaeological cases provide evidence for its occurrence in many periods of human history. While cases of postmortem fetal expulsion have always been rare, the phenomenon has been recorded under disparate circumstances and is occasionally seen in a modern forensic context when the body of <b>a</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> lies undisturbed and undiscovered for some time following death. There are also cases whereby a fetus may become separated {{from the body of}} the pregnant woman about the time of death or during decomposition, though because those cases are not consistent with the processes described here, they are not considered true cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
5|$|Ghosh, who co-wrote {{the story}} and the screenplay, began to plan the film while {{awaiting}} the release of his previous film Aladin (2009), but the dismal response to Aladin was a setback. He had to approach several producers to finance him for Kahaani, but was refused and discouraged from making the film owing to three factors: <b>a</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> as the lead star, a bunch of unknown Bengali actors as the supporting cast and Kolkata as a backdrop. Yashraj Films were willing to produce the film, but wanted Ghosh to sign a three-film deal, which he declined {{because he did not}} want that much commitment.|$|E

5|$|Kahaani was {{released}} on 9 March 2012, a day after International Women's Day. It played on 1100 screens worldwide. CNN-IBN reported that although Kahaani was ready before The Dirty Picture, distributors deferred its release, fearing that Vidya's role of a sexy siren (in The Dirty Picture) after that of <b>a</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> might not be received well. STAR TV bought the exclusive right to broadcast the film for a price of , which was the highest-ever price paid for a female-centric film in India. The Indian television premiere of the film was on Star India's channel Movies OK on 3 June 2012. The DVD of the film {{was released}} on 17 May 2012 across all regions in a one-disc pack in NTSC format. Distributed by Shemaroo Entertainment, it contained additional content, such as behind-the-scene footage, video of celebration parties after its theatrical release, and music videos of the songs of the film.

5|$|The episode {{opens with}} bootleggers being ambushed, and then {{moves to a}} Temperance rally two days earlier during which Nucky Thompson attracts the {{attention}} of <b>a</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> who later seeks assistance from Thompson for her husband, Schroeder. In a night club {{the day after the}} rally, we are introduced to other characters, including Thompson's brother, Eli, the town sheriff, and Jimmy Darmody, a political assistant. Thompson makes a deal to supply alcohol to four gangsters, including Arnold Rothstein who agrees to use his own men to transport the alcohol. Meanwhile, Schroeder drunkenly tangles with Thompson, and then beats his (Schroeder's) wife into a miscarriage. The next day, Darmody plots with Al Capone to rob Rothstein's incoming whiskey shipment. The episode returns to the ambush and we see Capone and Darmody shoot all the bootleggers and run off with the whiskey, with Darmody later giving Thompson a share of the heist.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} {{widespread}} fady about indri and sifakas. They are often protected from hunting and consumption {{because of their}} resemblance to humans and their ancestors, mostly due to their large size and upright or orthograde posture. The resemblance is even stronger for indri, which lack the long tail of most living lemurs. Known locally as babakoto ("Ancestor of Man"), the indri is sometimes seen as the progenitor of the family or clan. There are also stories of an indri that helped a human down from a tree, so they are seen as benefactors. Other lemur fady include the belief that a wife will have ugly children if her husband kills a woolly lemur, or that if <b>a</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> eats a dwarf lemur, her baby will get its beautiful, round eyes.|$|E
5|$|At Zeus Genetics clinic, Scully overhears <b>a</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman,</b> Mary Hendershot (Saxon Trainor), who {{is telling}} her doctor {{that she does}} not want to be under his care any more. In order to avoid being seen, Scully hides in a storeroom, finding it full of {{preserved}} fetuses that resemble the alien child seen earlier, but she is discovered by a doctor, Dr. Lev. Scully then phones Dr. Parenti, who is dissecting an alien fetus. She asks him to compare her ultrasound scan with the one given to her earlier. Later, while waiting to be attended to by Dr. Parenti, she has another flashback, recalling the time she sought a second opinion about her ova from Dr. Parenti, and was told that her ova might be viable with a sperm donor. In the present, she is called in to be attended to, and she is then assured her scans are in order. Later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Doggett confront Duffy about threatening letters he has been sending to both Mulder and Dr. Lev. However, when the agents leave, Duffy makes a phone call to Lev, warning him that they are being investigated. In another flashback, Scully asks Mulder to be the donor, to which he happily agrees.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{have served}} as {{experimental}} animals {{throughout the history of}} science. Eighteenth-century biologist Luigi Galvani discovered the link between electricity and the nervous system by studying frogs. In 1852, H. F. Stannius used a frog's heart in a procedure called a Stannius ligature to demonstrate the ventricle and atria beat independently of each other and at different rates. The African clawed frog or platanna (Xenopus laevis) was first widely used in laboratories in pregnancy tests {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. A sample of urine from <b>a</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> injected into a female frog induces it to lay eggs, a discovery made by English zoologist Lancelot Hogben. This is because a hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, is present in substantial quantities in the urine of women during pregnancy. In 1952, Robert Briggs and Thomas J. King cloned a frog by somatic cell nuclear transfer. This same technique was later used to create Dolly the sheep, and their experiment was the first time a successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in higher animals.|$|E

5|$|From 2009 to 2012, Vidya played leading {{roles in}} films that earned her several accolades. For {{the role of}} a single mother in the 2009 comedy-drama Paa, Vidya won her first Best Actress award at Screen and Filmfare, among other honours. For her {{portrayal}} of a seductress in the 2010 black comedy Ishqiya, she was awarded the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress and garnered a Best Actress nomination at the same ceremony. She also won Best Actress awards at other ceremonies, including Screen, Zee Cine, and Producers Guild. Vidya portrayed film actress Silk in the 2011 biographical film The Dirty Picture, for which she won a National Film Award for Best Actress, along with a second Best Actress award at Filmfare, IIFA, Producers Guild, and Zee Cine, and a third consecutive award in the same category at Screen. Also that year, she received Best Actress nominations at Filmfare and Screen for the 2011 crime thriller No One Killed Jessica.

5|$|The {{emergency}} room {{is filled with}} victims from a chain car accident, one of whom is admitted in the department of neurosurgery, under the care of Shepherd and Yang. As the physicians soon discover that he has been internally decapitated, they {{come to the conclusion that}} even a minor move would result in irreparable damage. <b>A</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> is admitted in plastic surgery, after having her arm severed. Meredith is assigned to work for Sloan during the day, and is immediately told to find the arm, much to the fascination of her interns. Despite trying to deal with her trainees in a strict manner, Stevens is looked upon as unprofessional by the interns she was assigned to. Her image is further deteriorated when she decides to abandon her hospital duties, in order to perform surgery on a deer, once again letting her emotional involvement interfere with her career. Meredith and Shepherd discuss the repercussions of their breakup, and realize that they cannot reconcile. However, the two engage in sexual intercourse, as a manner to express their mutual feelings for the last time. O'Malley comes to the realization of his love for Stevens, and quickly discloses to her that he shares her romantic feelings.|$|E
5|$|The other {{significant}} theory {{about the origin}} of the legend, proposed by Robert Chambers in 1864, is that a genuine child was born in the early 17th century with facial deformities resembling a pig's face and a speech impediment causing her to grunt. The science of teratology (the study of birth defects and physiological abnormalities) was then in its infancy, and the theory of maternal impression (that the thoughts of <b>a</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> could influence the future appearance of her children) was widely accepted. It is possible that the birth of a genuinely deformed child led to the story of the beggar as a possible explanation for her appearance, with other elements of the story being later additions or distortions by publishers. Chambers speculates that the original child may have had a similar appearance to Julia Pastrana, a woman with hypertrichosis and distorted (although not pig-like) facial features, who was widely exhibited in Europe and North America until her death in 1860, and then, embalmed, until the 1970s. However, while a 1952 stillbirth with a face resembling a pig is documented, {{there has never been a}} reliably documented case of a human with deformities of this kind surviving outside the womb, while all versions of the pig-faced woman legend describe her as a healthy adult.|$|E
