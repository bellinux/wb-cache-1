We model the problem of scheduling radiotherapy patients across several independent oncology units as a dynamic distributed constraint optimisation problem. Such an approach minimises the sharing of private information such as department operation details as well as patient privacy information while taking into consideration patient preferences as well as resource utilisation to find a pareto-optimal solution...|$|R

The problems of partial consistency and partial redundancy in the data are discussed. The data mart system serves multiple purposes: beside clinical reporting and quality assessment, the preparation steps for comprehensive studies are enormously simplified.
