5|$|A herd {{lives on}} the Rachel Carson {{component}} of the North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve, a series of five small islands and several salt marshes. There were no horses at the Sanctuary until the 1940s. It is unclear whether the Bankers swam over from nearby Shackleford or were left by residents who had used the islands to graze livestock. They are owned and managed {{by the state of}} North Carolina <b>and</b> <b>regarded</b> as a cultural resource.|$|E
5|$|Although Keynes {{has been}} widely criticised – {{especially}} {{by members of the}} Chicago school of economics – for advocating irresponsible government spending financed by borrowing, in fact he was a firm believer in balanced budgets <b>and</b> <b>regarded</b> the proposals for programs of public works during the Great Depression as an exceptional measure {{to meet the needs of}} exceptional circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1092 and {{completed}} in the early 15th century, Carlisle Cathedral is one of England’s smallest cathedrals since the demolition of its nave by the Scottish Presbyterian Army in 1649. Its most significant feature is its nine-light Flowing Decorated east window of 1322, still containing medieval glass in its upper sections, forming a “glorious termination to the choir” <b>and</b> <b>regarded</b> by many as having the finest tracery in England.|$|E

5|$|George Reid {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs non-Labour lines – prior to the 1906 election, he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionist Party in the middle. This attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in the Westminster tradition <b>and</b> <b>regarded</b> a two-party system as very much the norm.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 Auden fell in {{love with}} Chester Kallman <b>and</b> <b>regarded</b> their {{relationship}} as a marriage; this ended in 1941 when Kallman refused to accept the faithful relation that Auden demanded, but the two maintained their friendship, and from 1947 until Auden's death they lived in the same house or apartment in a non-sexual relationship, often collaborating on opera libretti such as The Rake's Progress, for music by Igor Stravinsky.|$|E

5|$|About 18 percent (40,000) of the Uruguayan {{population}} (220,000) spoke Portuguese <b>and</b> <b>regarded</b> {{themselves as}} Brazilian rather than Uruguayan. Many within Flores' ranks were Brazilians, some hailing {{from the nearby}} Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul. Life along the frontier between Rio Grande do Sul and Uruguay was often chaotic, with hostilities erupting between partisans of various cattle barons, cattle-rustling and random killings. Large landowners {{on both sides of}} the border had long been antagonistic toward Berro's policies. The Uruguayan president attempted to tax the cattle coming from Rio Grande do Sul and to impose curbs on the use of Brazilian slaves within Uruguayan territory; slavery had been outlawed years before in Uruguay.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} two Quatermass serials, the rights to adapt Quatermass and the Pit for the cinema were purchased by Hammer Film Productions. Their adaptation was released with the same title as the original in 1967, directed by Roy Ward Baker and scripted by Kneale. Scottish actor Andrew Keir starred as Quatermass, the role {{for which he was}} best remembered <b>and</b> <b>regarded</b> particularly highly in comparison to the previous film Quatermass, Brian Donlevy. The film, made in colour, is regarded by many commentators as a classic of the genre for the way it blends science fiction with the supernatural. In the United States the film was retitled Five Million Years to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Bute was {{determined}} to control the local government around Cardiff, considering it part of his rights and duties as a major landowner and aristocrat. On inheriting his estates, however, he found himself facing a difficult political situation. The Butes' grip on Glamorganshire had been weakened in the late 18th century, and the management of their political interests had been left {{for many years in}} the hands of John Wood, a local solicitor, whose family was embroiled in local politics, with their own set of interests. Glamorgan was also politically split between factions in the west and the east of the county, with most of Bute's estates in the eastern half. Bute's residence in the area, Cardiff Castle, was understaffed <b>and</b> <b>regarded</b> as unsuitable as a residence; consequently, he lacked the easy local patronage that would have come with a major, properly functioning establishment.|$|E

5|$|Donnchadh's {{territory}} lay {{in what is}} now Scotland {{south of}} the River Forth, a multi-ethnic region during the late 12th century. North of the Forth was the Gaelic kingdom of Scotland (Alba), which under its partially Normanised kings exercised direct or indirect control over most of the region to the south as far as the borders of Northumberland and Cumberland. Lothian and the Merse were the heartlands of {{the northern part of the}} old English Earldom of Northumbria, and in the late 12th century the people of these regions, as well as the people of Lauderdale, Eskdale, Liddesdale, and most of Teviotdale and Annandale, were English in language <b>and</b> <b>regarded</b> themselves as English by ethnicity, despite having been under the control of the king of the Scots for at least a century.|$|E
5|$|Geheime Staatspolizei ("Secret State Police"; Gestapo) was {{the secret}} police force of Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe. Formed in April 1933 by the {{aviation}} minister Hermann Göring, it was by the following year administrated by the SS <b>and</b> <b>regarded</b> as a sister organization of the SD. The Gestapo relied on members of other agencies, spies and a huge network of informants for information. It was led by Heydrich and Heinrich Müller. Whether trained as police originally or not, Gestapo agents themselves were shaped by their socio-political environment. Historian George C. Browder contends {{that there was a}} four-part process (authorization, bolstering, routinization, and dehumanization) in effect which legitimized the psycho-social atmosphere conditioning members of the Gestapo to radicalized violence. The power of the Gestapo included what was called, Schutzhaft ("protective custody"), a euphemism for the power to arrest and imprison people without judicial proceedings.|$|E
5|$|He {{was shot}} down most {{probably}} by Italian Spanish Civil War ace Tenente Lieutenant) Franco Lucchini of 90a Squadriglia, 10° Gruppo ("group"), 4° Stormo ("wing"). He landed, winded, and played dead to avoid being strafed. He started to walk towards the Allied lines and crossed the border at around midday the following day. After two days, he was rescued by a detachment from the 11th Hussars, who returned him to Sidi Barrani. Pattle was annoyed. He considered being shot down by the Italians as an embarrassment <b>and</b> <b>regarded</b> the episode as a slur on his reputation. After his forced march to friendly lines, he was also determined not {{to get lost in}} the desert again so he flew to Alexandria and bought a compass which he never flew without.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Rosendo Pascual {{and colleagues}} {{described}} a lower jaw of Sudamerica, which had previously only been known from isolated teeth. This jaw fragment showed that Sudamerica had four molariform teeth {{on each side}} of the lower jaws, more than any multituberculate, and consequently they removed gondwanatheres from Multituberculata <b>and</b> <b>regarded</b> their affinities as uncertain. As a consequence, Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues excluded Gondwanatheria from multituberculates, but identified the jaw fragment and a few upper premolars of Ferugliotherium as indeterminate multituberculates in a 2001 paper and a 2004 book. However, in 2009 Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck identified these fossils as Ferugliotherium and argued in favor of a close relationship between gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotheriidae) and multituberculates.|$|E
5|$|In {{development}} since 1999, {{the project}} was repeatedly delayed, going through several revisions and having {{some of its most}} ambitious and immersive features abandoned and the initially planned PlayStation 2 version cancelled. Although well received by most critics <b>and</b> <b>regarded</b> by some {{as one of the best}} horror video games of all time, Dark Corners of the Earth was a commercial failure. At least two additional Cthulhu Mythos games were planned by Headfirst Productions, including a direct sequel titled Call of Cthulhu: Destiny's End, but both were never completed due to Headfirst's bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|In middle age, Walton left Britain {{and set up}} {{home with}} his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he had ceased to be {{regarded}} as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, Troilus and Cressida, was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics {{at the time of their}} premieres, were revalued <b>and</b> <b>regarded</b> alongside his earlier works.|$|E

Domitian was apparently unable to gain support among the aristocracy, despite attempts to appease hostile factions with consular appointments. His autocratic style of government accentuated the Senate's loss of power, while his policy of treating patricians and even family members as equals to all Romans earned him their contempt.|$|E
5|$|Malhotra {{returned}} to the Wolf Pack the following season after failing to make the Rangers' roster out of training camp. With New York deep at the centre position, his AHL assignment was predicated on him learning to play wing. He received numerous call-ups to New York and finished the 2000–01 campaign with 11 points over 28 games in the AHL and 12 points over 50 games in the NHL. The season also marked a management change as Glen Sather took over as general manager, marking the departure of Smith, who had drafted Malhotra <b>and</b> <b>regarded</b> him as untradeable during his tenure.|$|E
5|$|Olaf and Thorgerd lived happily {{together}} at Hoskuldstead for some time. Around 962 Olaf's foster father Thord died, leaving Olaf his property and goðorð Olaf bought land {{and built a}} new homestead at Hjardarholt, which, according to the saga, he had to cleanse of the draugr of its former owner, Killer-Hrapp. As time went on people began to settle near Olaf's hall <b>and</b> <b>regarded</b> him as their goði. Olaf's ever-increasing wealth caused jealousy from Hoskuld's wife Jorunn. Around the same time Olaf and Thorgerd had a daughter, Thurid. Hjardarholt was renowned for its rich decorations; some two decades later, the skald Úlfr Uggason composed the famous poem Húsdrápa, about certain mythological scenes illustrated {{on the walls of}} Olaf's hall.|$|E
