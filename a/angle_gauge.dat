50|$|Some {{trees are}} on the {{borderline}} of the plot and must be checked {{to be sure they}} are to be included. The limiting distance must be calculated to see if the trees are in or out. The equation to calculate the limiting distance in feet is Diameter at breast height, DBH, in inches times plot radius factor, PRF, in feet/area Dlim=DBH*PRF For example, using a BAF 10 <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> a forester needs to know the limiting distance for a 20 in tree. The PRF using a 10 BAF <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> is 2.75 ft for every inch of tree diameter. Therefore, 20 inches * 2.75 ft/inch = 55 ft. This means that a 20 in tree must be over 55 ft away {{from the center of the}} plot using a BAF 10 <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> to be out of the plot.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a concept}} that comes from {{variable}} radius plots, or point sampling. It happens when a tree cannot be easily determined as in or out when using a prism or <b>angle</b> <b>gauge.</b> Borderline trees occur only when the distance from the sampling point {{to the center of the}} tree is equal to the DBH times plot radius factor (PRF). The PRF is determined based on the type of prism or <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> being used. Basal Area Factor (BAF) 5, 10, and 20 angle gauges result in PRFs of 3.89, 2.75, and 1.94 (feet inch−1) respectively. The metric equivalents of these PRFs are 0.467, 0.33, and 0.233 (m cm−1).|$|E

40|$|In {{the field}} of <b>angle</b> metrology, <b>angle</b> <b>gauges</b> and polygons are the {{material}} artefact standards. Conventionally, autocollimator along with indexing table, are used for the calibration of <b>angle</b> <b>gauges</b> and polygons. A novel multiple reflections method is devised at NPLI to improve the uncertainty of measurements during calibrations. A polygon under calibration is fixed at the centre of a Moore’s indexing table within eccentricity offset ± 20 μm. A reference autocollimator is aligned {{to one of the}} face of the polygon. A flat reflector is fixed in the centre of a rotatable table. The rotatable table is arranged to collect the optical beam on to the flat reflector then deflected to same face of the polygon, wherefrom the light beam is received at the autocollimator. Thus the optical beam strikes the same face of the polygon twice. Therefore the resolution of the reference autocollimator is virtually doubled. In this experimental setup, two set of readings are obtained simultaneously. One set of the readings corresponds to conventional method and the second set of the readings belongs to the proposed novel method. The readings of the autocollimator are analysed and the results are discussed in the article. The results thus obtained by conventional method are compared with the results obtained using the proposed method. Using this novel calibration method, the uncertainty of measurement is improved from ± 0. 39 ″ to ± 0. 23 ″...|$|R

50|$|Bitterlich's {{method was}} {{to choose a}} number of {{sampling}} points. The researcher traveled to each sampling point {{just as in the}} quadrat method. At each sampling point the researcher used an <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> to see if a tree had a larger apparent angle than the gauge. If so, the tree was counted. No quadrat and no measurements!

50|$|A {{variable}} size plot is {{more dependent}} {{of the size}} of the trees. The tract is measured on a series of points and the trees are tallied for being in or out depending on their size and location relevant to the plot center. Usually an <b>angle</b> <b>gauge,</b> wedge prism or Relascope are used to gather data for this type of plot. This allows for a very quick estimate of the volume and species of a given tract.|$|E
50|$|The Relascope is {{very similar}} to the <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> and the wedge prism in that {{it can be used to}} find the basal area of a tree from a point {{depending}} on the basal area factor in a variable radius sampling method. The main difference in this instrument though is that it has multiple uses as described previously. Some other advantages over similar devises in that it accounts for the slope one is from the tree giving a more accurate measurement than similar tools.|$|E
50|$|Importantly, {{the bottom}} edge of the prism must be roughly {{parallel}} to the ground in order to provide an accurate estimate on sloped ground. Wedge prisms can be difficult to use in wet conditions due to the effect water droplets have on the optical properties of the glass. Wedge prisms come in different colors such as clear or amber. The amber provides the same function as the clear wedge prism, only it reduces glare and is easier to use on overcast or cloudy days. Operating a wedge prism is one technique used in forestry today because, the wedge prism is simple, relatively inexpensive, portable, and as accurate as other <b>angle</b> <b>gauges</b> when properly calibrated and used properly. One simply holds the prism directly over the plot center, and by focusing on a tree, the refracted light will offset the trunk of the tree. The wedge prism is used to take measurements in both land management and in timber procurement. Other tools often used to accompany the wedge prism in taking forest inventory are clinometers, Biltmore sticks, relascopes, and Diameter Tapes.|$|R

In this type of sampling, the wedge prism is used to estimate basal area of a group of trees by counting trees which are [...] "in" [...] or [...] "out" [...] of a plot centered on a single point. Because the wedge prism refracts light to offset the object of interest (e.g. a tree), {{it can be used to}} determine whether or not the tree should be counted from a given point, based on the diameter at breast height of the tree and its distance from that point.|$|E
40|$|To realise precise, {{real-time}} {{measurement of}} forest volume, this study discusses {{the principles and}} method of forest volume measurement when utilizing an electronic gauge. Use of the electronic gauge, to count trees within five concentric circles, resulted in {{a decrease in the}} variation of estimated forest volume, as the number of circles increased. This estimate became reliable upon reaching the fourth concentric circle. In contrast, the use of a conventional <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> revealed no obvious regularity and no significant trend using multiple observation points. As well, for forest inventory plots with uneven spatial distribution, there was relatively low precision when using multiple observation points with a conventional angle gauge: the relative errors of forest volume measurement reached almost 40 % in the first plot using multiple observation points. The electronic <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> is comprised of a telescope and Charge Coupled Device (CCD) system, which reduced the probability of a misreading and achieved accurate real-time measurement of forest volume. Observers can choose an arbitrary location to position the electronic <b>angle</b> <b>gauge.</b> The survey time with the new method was half that of using a conventional <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> at five different observation locations.

The theory behind these methods is based on sampling straight pieces of downed coarse woody debris. When pieces deviate from this ideal situation, auxiliary methods must be employed. We describe a two-stage procedure where the relascope is used to select pieces of downed coarse woody debris in the first stage. If the pieces so chosen on the first stage have multiple branches and detailed estimates are required for the entire piece, then a second stage sample is advocated using the randomized branch technique.

Permanent sample locations in stands managed with different silvicultural treatments within the Penobscot Experimental Forest (Maine, USA) were used as the sampling locations. Point relascope sampling (PRS) with three different angles spanning the practical range of angles for such stands was used along with 40 m of LIS sample per sample point. Compared to LIS, the three angles resulted in similar number of pieces and volume of CWM from stands with different histories of repeated partial harvests. In terms of sampling efficiency, PRS was up to 4 times more efficient than LIS.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The {{relationship}} between Leaf Area Index (LAI) and current stem-wood production was examined in selected stands in eastern Washington. Stands were sampled with an <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> (prism). LAI was estimated from sapwood area; current stem-wood production from DBH, height, and radial increment. Maximum LAI attainable {{on a given}} site has been related to qualities of the environment. Where stocking varies on a given site, LAI {{is related to the}} degree of utilization of the available resources. The average leaf area per tree, relative to average tree size, is a measure of stand vigor. To compare the relative sapwood area of trees of different sizes, allometric regressions of sapwood area from DBH were derived, for five species, from fully stocked stands. In fully stocked stands with dominant Douglas-fir, current productivity was more closely related to average LAI than to either Site Index alone or predictions by Cochran (1979) based on Site Index, basal area, and age. Within stands displaying a range of stocking on a given site, wood production per unit of leaf area decreased as LAI increased; nonetheless, productivity per hectare generally increased up to the highest LAI observed in each stand.

Compared with the currently most accurate technique, roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA), {{the difference between the}} RSA and the MAS is 0. 12 ° ± 1. 64 °. An accuracy with an error of 0. 08 ° ± 1. 15 ° is determined by means of an <b>angle</b> <b>gauge.</b> Although {{a significant difference between the}} MAS and the goniometer (p = 0. 04) is found around the X-axis (θ; transverse plane), it is limited to < 1 °.

The backward inclination of the apical vertebra (AV) and forward inclination of the upper-end vertebra (UEV) around the Y-axis (Φ) results in a correction of the hypokyphosis shown by the Cobb angle in the sagittal plane. The clockwise rotation of the UEV in the Z-axis (Ψ) leads to a reduction of the Cobb angle in the frontal plane.

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis {{has been carried out}} in the following two areas of Optical metrology: 1. Measurement and correction of prism angles 2. Measurement of refractive indices using a spectrograph. The prism angles are conventionally tested by mechanical bevel protractors, autocol-limators (angle dekkors), simple interference techniques and interferometers. All these methods have their own limitations either in accuracy or in terms of cost. Mechanical methods are usually employed to measure the angles of prisms. Interference techniques and interferometers are also used but they need optically polished components. For both mechanical and simple interference methods of testing, it is essential to fabricate more than a single component in number. The process of building interferometers or purchasing interferometers, angle dekkors and standard <b>angle</b> <b>gauges</b> is not cost effective for many research laboratories, and medium scale industries. To overcome these difficulties simple and inexpensive methods without sacrificing the accuracy in the bargain are suggested for the measurement of prism angles, based on the principles of reflection of light. The refractive indices of prism materials for invisible and weaker spectral lines are usually determined from spectrograms using dispersion formulae and numerical interpolation techniques. In these methods, the accuracy of the results depends on the accuracy of determining the constants of the dispersion formulae. A simple experimental technique, using a spectrograph, is devised for the measurement of refractive indices of solids and liquids both for visible and invisible spectral lines (wavelengths). The thesis has been divided into six chapters. The first chapter starts with the general introduction. The second chapter presents the literature review of the existing methods for angle and refractive index measurements.
