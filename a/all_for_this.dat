25|$|Hannity {{came under}} {{criticism}} during the 2016 presidential election for false claims about election rigging during interviews. Hannity {{responded to this}} by citing Mitt Romney's failure in 2012 to obtain any votes in 59 of 1,687 Philadelphia voting districts as proof of election rigging. However, Factcheck.org and PolitiFact {{found that it was}} not unusual at <b>all</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> to occur, as those districts are heavily African-American. Philadelphia elections inspector Ryan Godfrey also refuted Hannity's claim.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of <b>All</b> <b>for</b> <b>This,</b> it was {{announced}} that Moody had created and is also currently a member of a new rock band called We Are the Fallen. The members of the band include American Idol 7 finalist Carly Smithson as the lead singer, former Evanescence members Rocky Gray and John LeCompt, and Moody's friend Marty O'Brien. We Are the Fallen made their first public appearance together for a press conference at SIR Studios in Los Angeles, CA, on June 22, 2009. Their debut album, Tear The World Down was released in May 2010 to generally positive reviews. The band toured for most of the year in support of the album, and filmed their first live DVD, Cirque Des Damnés, at the Avalon Theatre. The DVD was scheduled for release in late 2011.|$|E

This release would be delayed, however, as was hinted at in February 2009, when Moody's official website displayed the release as [...] "available 2009" [...] instead of the March 3 release date. On June 9, 2009, Moody's debut solo album, entitled <b>All</b> <b>for</b> <b>This,</b> was released digitally via Amazon.com, iTunes, and Amie Street through Moody's label, FNR Records.|$|E

2500|$|Association was {{considered}} to be of critical importance for the practice of the art. However, it was clearly recognized that associations in memory are idiosyncratic, hence, what works for one will not automatically work for <b>all.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> reason, the associative values given for images in memory texts are usually intended as examples and are not intended to be [...] "universally normative". Yates offers a passage from Aristotle that briefly outlines the principle of association. In it, he mentions the importance of a starting point to initiate a chain of recollection, {{and the way in which}} it serves as a stimulating cause.|$|E
2500|$|That Brugg and Windisch {{have grown}} into one another, {{along with the}} close {{cooperation}} necessary for {{the realization of the}} project [...] "Vision Mitte", led to calls for the merger of the two communities. Both town councils voted strongly in favor of an initiative to launch negotiations for such a fusion in May 2006. A referendum, however, was launched in opposition to this decision. Voting was held on September 24, 2006, the results of which showed a clear majority of the electorate – 63 percent – opposed to such a merger. There were two reasons, above <b>all,</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> opposition: the large difference between the tax rates of the communities and the debt held by the municipality of Windisch. For these reasons discussion of a merger is not likely to arise again before the completion of the [...] "Vision Mitte" [...] campus.|$|E
