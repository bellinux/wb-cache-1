40|$|We {{report an}} {{experimental}} observation of multiple co [...] rotating vortices in a extended dust {{column in the}} background of non [...] uniform diffused plasma. Inductively coupled RF discharge is initiated {{in the background of}} argon gas in the source region which later found to diffuse in the main experimental chamber. A secondary DC glow discharge plasma is produced to introduce the dust particles into the plasma. These micron sized poly-disperse dust particles get charged in the plasma environment and transported by the ambipolar electric field of the diffused plasma and found to confine in the potential well, where the resultant electric field of the diffused plasma (ambipolar E [...] field) and glass wall charging (sheath E [...] field) hold the micron sized particles against the gravity. Multiple co [...] rotating (<b>anti</b> [...] <b>clockwise)</b> dust vortices are observed in the dust cloud for a particular discharge condition. The transition from multiple to single dust vortex is observed when input RF power is lowered. Occurrence of these vortices are explained {{on the basis of the}} charge gradient of dust particles which is orthogonal to the ion drag force. The charge gradient is a consequence of the plasma inhomogeneity along the dust cloud length. The detailed nature and the reason for multiple vortices are still under investigation through further experiments, however, preliminary qualitative understanding is discussed based on characteristic scale length of dust vortex. There is a characteristic size of the vortex in the dusty plasma so that multiple vortices is possible to form in the extended dusty plasma with inhomogeneous plasma background. The experimental results on the vortex motion of particles are compared with a theoretical model and found some agreement. Comment: The manuscript is of 10 pages which contains 9 figure...|$|R

50|$|During {{a time of}} high {{unemployment}} {{during the winter of}} 1908 and 1909, over 700 men relaid the park, including planting banks with shrubs and trees, diverting the Gore Brook and creating a lake and island covering just over 6 acre. Local legend speaks of a tunnel running from the boat house, underneath the lake (only a few feet deep) to somewhere on the island, though this was, in fact, never true. Access to the island was only ever possible by boat. The park, named Platt Fields Park, was formally opened on 7 May 1910 by the Lord Mayor of Manchester, Sir Charles Behrens. The Main Lake was provided with a large boat house and wood covered slipway. It housed not only a fleet of large, clinker built rowing boats and skiffs but also a fine motor launch, the Archie Littlemore, which gave rides during the summer months. 'Twice Around the Island'. At some point over the following five years, a half acre, kidney shaped paddling pool was constructed, on the Hart Road side of the main lake. On the side of the paddling pool away from the Main Lake, two further model boating lakes were constructed. The largest was the home of Platt Fields Model Yacht Club, which had a large, veranda fronted boathouse adjacent to the lake. Alongside was the children's boating lake. This shallow, circular lake was constructed entirely above ground, with raised concrete sides. This meant that children could safely sail, without any danger of falling in. Moving away from the model lakes, towards the Hart Road entrance, the long, narrow field on the right hand side of the path was home to the local model engineering society, which installed a triple gauge track for large model railway vehicles, including 'live steam' locomotives. The track was raised above the ground on concrete pylons, drivers and passengers riding astride the track. In the centre of the circuit of track stood a wooden club house. Moving on from this point, <b>anti</b> <b>clockwise</b> around the main lake brought you to the Platt Fields Lido. A 25 yard long, open air swimming pool, with changing facilities. The plunge depth was 3 to 6 feet. In later years the Lido was closed, the plunge filled with soil and surrounded by a fence. This became a rabbit warren, the centre piece of a Pet's Corner. The changing and ancillary buildings were converted into cages for small animals and birds. In latter years, all traces of the former Lido have been removed and the area landscaped. The park was used for a variety of sports, including tennis, football, bowling and cricket. More work was carried out during another time of {{high unemployment}}, between 1919 and 1925, when the park and playing fields were levelled, and bowling greens and tennis courts were constructed. Beside the path which leads from the corner of the Main Lake, towards Platt Hall, a large circular amphitheatre was sunk into the ground. At its centre a stage, with covered band stand, was surrounded by terraced seating. No trace of this installation remains today, unless you consult an aerial photograph. The position of the amphitheatre is now clearly delineated by a ring of trees which have grown up around the buried structure. A Speakers' Corner was once located near to the adjacent Holy Trinity Platt Church.|$|E

It is especially important for machines in Industries which have to monitor the transition periods, or for machines used for Image Processing. Using AVR Studio 4, and AVR GCC, a C code for decoding the quadrature signals is being presented, which gives the pulse for one cycle and the direction in which the encoder is being rotated.

40|$|It is {{needless to}} say that four {{quadrant}} principle plays {{a vital role in}} industrial applications. Running a machine both in motoring and generating action illustrates the four quadrant operation.

Here, converter performs dual function i. e. both as rectifier (AC to DC) and inverter (DC to AC) Though the carrier period is fixed, the ON/OFF pulse widths are changing continuously that’s why this type of switching is called Pulse Width Modulation,(PWM).

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the main}} {{challenges}} in shape matching is overcoming intra–class variation where objects that are conceptually similar have significant geometric dissimilarity. The key to a solution around this problem is incorporating {{the structure of the}} object in the shape descriptor which can be described by a connectivity graph customarily extracted from its skeleton. In a slightly different perspective, the structure may also be viewed as the arrangement of protruding parts along its boundary. This arrangement does not only convey the protruding part's ordering along the <b>anti</b> <b>clockwise</b> direction, but also relates these parts on different levels of detail. In this paper, we propose a shape matching method that estimates the distance between two objects by conducting a part-to-part matching analysis between their visual protruding parts. We start by a skeleton-based segmentation of the shape inspired by the Chordal Axis Transform. Then, we extract the segments that represent the protruding parts in its silhouette on varied levels of detail. Each one of these parts is described by a feature vector. A shape is thus described by the feature vectors of its parts in addition to their angular and linear proximities to each other. Using dynamic programming, our algorithm finds a minimal cost correspondence between parts. Our experimental evaluations validate the proposition that part correspondence allows conceptual matching of precisely dissimilar shapes...|$|E
40|$|Characteristics of {{sediment}} transport {{in a small}} catchment in the Spanish Pyrenees. The transport of suspended sediment during a stormflow event is very variable. The resulting hysteretic loop {{of the relationship of}} the discharge and suspended sediment concentration is used in the present paper to classificate rainfall-runoff-events and identify by canonical discriminant analysis the factors determining the different event types. The analysis of 19 events in a headwater catchment of the Central Pyrenees leads to the identification of 3 types of floods. A majoritary with clockwise shaped hysteretic loop, a second one with anti-clockwise shaped hysteretic loop and a third group with eight shaped hysteretic loop. The most important factor for generating different types of events is the soil moisture in the catchment. On a secondary level, total rainfall amount and precipitation of the 3 days before are important. So, the different flood types are generated with different contributing areas or by different processes. Clockwise shaped events have limited sources of suspended sediment near the channel with limited supply. <b>Anti</b> <b>clockwise</b> shaped events lead sediments from all over the catchment to the ravine.

Sabine’s Gulls breeding in northeast Greenland displayed an average annual migration of almost 32 000 km (n = 6), with the longest return journey spanning close to 39 000 km (not including local movements at staging sites or within the wintering area). On their southern migration, they spent an average of 45 days in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Sea, off the coasts of France, Spain and Portugal. They all wintered in closeassociation with the cold waters of the Benguela Upwelling, spending an average of 152 days in that area. On their return north, Sabine’s Gulls staged off the west African coast (Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal), spending on average 19 days at this site.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{modeling}} of Low Stiffness Resilience Shaft (LSRS) for the Semi-Active Steering (SAS) system using wire ropes {{is discussed in}} this paper, along with the static structural torsion test simulation of the wire ropes {{in order to determine}} the best possible configuration which serves the purpose of an LSRS. The importance of this study arises due to the unidirectional torsional properties of a wire rope. For an effective operational LSRS, the wire ropes need to have similar angular deflection in both the clockwise and anti-clockwise direction. LSRS, an integral component of the SAS is a flexible shaft that can replace the conventional rigid shaft of the steering system and allows active control to be performed. 3 D solid models of the simple strand and the 4 strand wire ropes used in finite element analysis were generated in CAD software SolidWorksTM. The single strand and the different configuration of wire ropes required to function the LSRS effectively were then analyzed using Finite element simulation in ANSYSTM. A single wire rope could not be used because its construction has inconsistency in the torsional stiffness in clockwise and anti-clockwise direction. The single-strand right-direction lay wire rope is found to have 16. 05 % angular deflection percentage difference in the clockwise and anticlockwise directions which indicates that using a single strand wire rope for the LSRS will cause the vehicle to have a variable response in the clockwise and <b>anti</b> <b>clockwise</b> direction upon turning the steering wheel. Due to this inconsistency, two variations namely Variation 1 and Variation 2 with arrangement of 4 strand wire rope were devised so that the angular deflection percentage difference would be negligible. Simulation results indicated that Variation 1 of the two variations with an angular deflection percentage difference of 0. 34 % in the clockwise and anti-clockwise direction respectively is best suited for the use in LSRS as it has almost negligible angular deflection percentage difference and will allow the vehicle to have similar steering response in the clockwise and anti-clockwise direction...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{measurements}} on single and coupled Josephson persistent current qubits are presented. The Josephson persistent current qubit {{consists of a}} superconducting loop intersected by three Josephson junctions. When half a flux quantum {{is applied to the}} loop this system acts as a quantum two state system. The two states are associated with a clock or <b>anti</b> <b>clockwise</b> current flowing in the loop and can be measured using a SQUID magnetometer. The research presented in this thesis aimed at achieving coupling between two Josephson persistent current qubits and to show conditional gate operations in such a coupled qubit system. Also it was tried to improve the coherence properties of a single qubit by using a gradiometer type configuration to minimize influence from fluxnoise which would cause a disturbance of the energy bias of the qubit system. The basic principles of the Josephson persistent current qubit are discussed, as well as design criteria to minimize decoherence due to the environment seen by the squid or microwave lines. Spectroscopy measurements have been performed on coupled qubit systems mapping out the energy level structure of these systems. For two coupled qubits the origin and magnitude of the coupling J is derived for coupling via the geometrical inductance between the qubits. Also it is shown that coupling via a shared junction or a shared line acts the same as the geometrical coupling. Spectroscopy measurements show coupling for qubits which are mainly geometrical coupled and spectroscopy measurements on an other sample show a coupling for qubits coupled via a large shared Josephson junction. Using such a shared junction allows for the coupling to be designed within a large range. For the coupled qubit system with coupling via a large junction spectroscopy measurements from both the ground state to higher states {{as well as from the}} partially populated first excited state to higher states have been performed and the level structure of this system is mapped out. The energy level structure is in good agreement with the 4 level approximation for two coupled qubits. Coherent Rabi oscillations between two states flipping either qubit of this system have been performed with an oscillation decay time of up to 70 ns. Also conditional spectroscopy has been performed by first going coherently from the ground state to a higher state and then incoherently pumping the system to other states. Spectroscopy measurements on a gradiometer type Josephson persistent current qubit show trapped fluxoid biasing can be used to create a phase bias of pi over the qubit junctions. The results of this thesis show that coupling between Josephson persistent current qubits can be achieved and designed within the wanted range. Superpositions between the ground state and higher states in such a coupled qubit system have been created by performing Rabi oscillations. Also conditional spectroscopy has been performed.

40|$|En este trabajo se analiza el origen y las relaciones entre travertinos y jasperoides intercalados en rocas volcaniclásticas jurásicas en el distrito argento-aurífero Manantial Espejo, ubicado en el borde sur-occidental del Macizo del Deseado, provincia de Santa Cruz, Argentina. Los cuerpos de travertino constituyen estratos delgados de hasta 60 cm de espesor de calcita micrítica finamente laminada, en ocasiones con estratificación rítmica de calcita y ópalo, asociados a depósitos de tobas de caída y tufitas de ambiente lacustre. En algunos afloramientos, los morfotipos reconocidos revelan que la precipitación del carbonato correspondía a sectores proximales relacionados a geisers y conductos de vapor, los cuales se orientaban a los largo de las fracturas que constituyeron los canales de circulación de fluidos. La {{posterior}} silicificación de los niveles carbonáticos produjeron jasperoides que se presentan como cuerpos tabulares subverticales y subhorizontales, estos últimos con características texturales similares a aquellas de sinters. La silicificación se originó tardíamente, posiblemente durante la etapa principal del régimen hidrotermal que generó las vetas portadoras de plata y oro. Los travertinos se formaron en un ambiente de hot spring, relacionado con fracturas de un sistema de cizalla conjugado orientadas entre N 20 ° a 45 ° E y N 20 ° a 40 ° O y constituyen las evidencias más tempranas de la presencia de un régimen epitermal asociado al proceso volcánico jurásico, en un régimen tectónico distensivo, en Manantial Espejo. In {{the last}} few years, an intense mining prospecting activity for gold and silver epithermal deposits {{has been carried out}} in the Deseado Massif, Argentina. As a result, many hot spring related deposits, of possible Jurassic age, have been detected. This paper describes the mineralogical and textural characteristics as well as the facies of a group of travertine and jasperoid outcrops occurring near the silver-gold carrying lodes in the Manantial Espejo prospect (Schalamuk et al., 1998). A genetic interpretation of the deposits is done {{on the basis of their}} structural, textural, and emplacement characteristics. Their possible relationship with the epithermal mineralization is also considered. The Manantial Espejo district is located on the southwestern area of the Deseado Massif, in the middle of the province of Santa Cruz (Fig. 1). The area is almost entirely covered by andesitic and rhyolithic rocks of the Bajo Pobre and Chon Aike Formations, the product of a strong, bimodal volcanic activity of Jurassic age. This volcanic event developed in a back-arc tectonic environment linked to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean (Uliana et al., 1985; Riley et al., 2001). Acidic rocks prevail in the area, consisting on high-grade ignimbrites with ash fall tuffs, tuffites, and hydroclastic breccias (Fig. 2). Among them, the chemical and biogenic carbonate and silica deposits, are present (Fig. 3). The travertine mantles can be up to 0. 5 m thick and, in most of cases, they overlie tuffite layers. Typically, the rock is laminated in millimetrical to submillimetrical laminae of dense, hard, non porous micritic carbonate, displaying three types of lamination: parallel sub-horizontal; stromatolithic; and, «en echelon» (possibly, a terrace facies, Fig. 4). Sometimes, the laminated structure consists of a rhythmic deposit of calcium carbonate and opal (Figs. 5 a, b), unusual association in hot spring deposits, both recent and fossil (Jones et al., 2000 a; Campbell et al., 2002; Canet et al., 2005). A variety of porous travertine, dominated by small, sub-spherical and columnar growths, of the microstromatolithic or the oncoid types. The travertine layers grade laterally to siliceous laminated jasperoids (sensu Spur, 1898 and Lovering, 1972), which make sub-horizontal mantles, 0. 5 to 2. 0 m thick, with identical sedimentary structures as those of travertines, although they are entirely formed of chalcedony, which is interpreted as the product of replacement of calcite into silica (Fig. 6 a, b). Silicification occurred at a later stage, during the intense hydrothermal alteration accompanying the formation of the quartz veins carrying gold and silver. Some jasperoid outcrops show grossly stratified, rounded surfaces with domical structures, forming banks 0. 2 to 0. 4 m thick, and showing a more or less concentric layout which could correspond to the silicification of bio-built algal structures (Fig. 6 b). The occurrence of small vents (Fig. 6 e) show the water and steam outlets. Vertical, tabular, laminated bodies, filling fractures of NE-SW strike and slip up to 1, 000 m, and 3 m thick (Fig. 6 f, h). They are formed of chalcedony, displaying a vertical, banded and, at times, diffuse (Fig. 6 g) or breccia like structure. The morphology of the travertines and associated jasperoids in the Manantial Espejo district are compared with travertines or hot spring deposits in general, of Quaternary or Recent (Guo and Riding, 1999; Chafetz and Guidry, 2003; Hancock et al., 1999). The analogies founded allowed to reconstruct, at least in part, the depositional environment of the studied rocks (Fig. 8). The sub-vertical, tabular bodies of banded silica, would correspond to subsurface levels of fissure ridges, where erosion has generally eliminated the surface deposits with sub-horizontal stratification overlying the faults. The northernmost end of the Ayelen Oeste «vein» (Fig. 6 h) would correspond to the proximal zone of the discharge channel, very close to the fissure, since part of the sub-horizontal stratification next to the fracture (zone B in Fig. 8). This area represents the most active depositional environment, where the carbonate precipitation rate is higher. Figure 6 e shows a fluid outlet vent in a spring zone (zone C, in Fig. 8). The «en echelon» stratification shows very similar characteristics to those of terraces and micro-terraces occurring in modern hot springs. Micro-terraces shown in Figure 5 e, found near one of the fissure crests, could correspond to those formed laterally to the outlet channels (D, in Fig. 8). As to that shown in Figure 5 f, associated to travertine with sub-horizontal, parallel lamination, could correspond to that formed in the edges of pools. With regard to the parallel lamination of micritic carbonate, occurring in most of the outcrops, it may correspond to the lacustrine rims (sensu Pentecost, 1995). This type of thin lamination, forming laterally extended banks, several tens of decimeters thick, would have formed on depressed surfaces, with a distal position relative to the spring zones. The rhythmic intercalation of thin opal laminae between the calcite layers occurring in some outcrops, reveals temporary changes in the physical-chemical conditions of the mineral precipitation, possibly seasonal temperature fluctuations. Finally, the observed stromatolites and microstromatolites (Fig. 5 c, g, h) indicate the presence of microorganisms in the geothermal environment. Although there is no agreement among researchers about the organic or inorganic origin of these morphotypes in geothermal environments, it is admitted that algae and bacteria induce the precipitation of calcium carbonate. The stratigraphic position of the calcareous levels identified in Manantial Espejo show that the hot spring environment began to develop early in the district, associated to an extensional tectonic regime coincident with the La Frisia or Zanjón del Pescado System (Reimer et al., 1996) which caused fracturing (direct faults) N 20 ° to 45 º E, and N 20 º to 40 ° W, as a consequence of aó 1 located around 0 °. The produced faults, made the main hydrothermal fluid circulation channels (barren) which, after reaching the surface and losing the dissolved CO 2, precipitated the calcium carbonate. The migration of the maximum stress (<b>anti</b> <b>clockwise,</b> at 315 °) produced a new stress field, the Bajo Grande System (Panza, 1982, 1984) generating direct faulting combined with dextral movement, at a 110 ° azimuth, cutting and displacing the subvertical travertine bodies. These new fluid circulation channels end up lodging the quartz veins carrying silver and gold...|$|E
