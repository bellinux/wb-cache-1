5|$|Catalytic triads perform {{covalent}} catalysis via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate {{is resolved}} by water, {{the result is}} hydrolysis of the substrate.

For example, <b>attack</b> <b>by</b> an acyl group results in an acyltransferase reaction. Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour attack of a second substrate.|$|E
