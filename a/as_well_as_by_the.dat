5|$|An HDF {{counterpart}} {{in the southern}} celestial hemisphere was created in 1998: the HDF-South. Created using a similar observing strategy, the HDF-S was very similar in appearance to the original HDF. This supports the cosmological principle that at its largest scale the Universe is homogeneous. The HDF-S survey used the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) instruments installed on the HST in 1997; the Hubble Deep Field has since been re-observed several times using WFPC2, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> NICMOS and STIS instruments. Several supernova events were detected by comparing {{the first and second}} epoch observations of the HDF-N.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from eastern Africa {{extending from the}} Rift Valley from Ethiopia to northern Tanzania represents the largest archaeological evidence of the shift from the Late Acheulian to the Middle Stone Age tool technologies. This transition is characterized by stratigraphic layering of Acheulian stone tools, a bifacial handaxe technology, underneath and even contemporaneous with MSA technologies, such as Levallois tools, flakes, flaked tools, pointed flakes, smaller bifaces that are projectile in form, and, on rare occasions, hafted tools. Evidence of the gradual displacement of Acheulian by MSA technologies is further supported by this layering and contemporaneous placement, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> earliest appearance of MSA technologies at Gademotta and the latest Acheulian technologies at the Bouri Formation of Ethiopia, dated to 154 to 160 kya. This suggests a possible overlap of 100-150 thousand years.|$|E

North Petherton was the first town in England (and one of the few ever) to be lit by acetylene gas lighting, supplied by the North Petherton Rosco Acetylene Company. Street lights were provided in 1906. Acetylene was replaced in 1931 by coal gas produced in Bridgwater, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> provision of an electricity supply.|$|E

A feature of the upper park is the Fountain of Trilby, which was placed there in 1829. The lower park is modelled upon a style called the Italian Renaissance garden. It features three pairs of Medici lions near the staircase leading up to the palace's southern façade, carved out of carrara marble by sculptor Giovanni Bonnani.|$|E
5|$|Headgear {{was either}} the SS M43 fez {{which was to}} be worn by all ranks, while German {{officers}} had the option to wear the mountain cap (Bergmütze).

There were two versions of the fez: a field gray model to be worn in combat and while on duty and a red model for parades, marching exercises and while off duty. Both the fez and mountain cap bore the death's head and eagle of the SS. The mountain cap was also adorned with an Edelweiss flower patch, worn {{on the left side of}} the cap.|$|E

5|$|King Amangkurat I {{died during}} his retreat in Tegal in July 1677.

However, he failed to assert his authority {{in the nearby town}} of Cirebon, whose ruler decided to declare independence from Mataram with support from the Banten Sultanate. Furthermore, his younger brother Pangeran Puger (later PakubuwanaI) took the now-ruined capital, refused entry to AmangkuratII's loyalists, and declared himself king under the title of Ingalanga Mataram.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1898, back in Romania, Bogdan-Pitești and {{the other}} Salonul Independenților {{initiators}} joined up with author Ioan Bacalbașa and architect Ștefan Ciocâlteu.

Its steering committee was later joined by the intellectual and political figures Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, Nicolae Xenopol, and Nicolae Filipescu, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> painter Jean Alexandru Steriadi. The society took up the effort to uproot against academic salons, organizing a large and provocative exhibit in 1898, and, {{at the height of}} its popularity, enlisted in its ranks some 300 people.

She joined the Communist Party at the age of 18, and in 1929 traveled to the Soviet Union as a Scottish delegate to a gathering of young communists. She founded a local children's wing of the Communist Party, carried out a successful agitation to declare 1 May a school holiday, and worked for communist Member of Parliament Willie Gallacher. She retired from active politics at the age of 60, but continued to give talks and write her memoirs, published in 1991 as A Miner's Lass.|$|E
5|$|Palestinian cuisine {{consists}} of foods from or commonly eaten by Palestinians—which includes {{those living in}} Palestine, Israel, Jordan, refugee camps in nearby countries <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Palestinian diaspora. The cuisine is a diffusion of the cultures of civilizations that settled {{in the region of}} Palestine, particularly during and after the Islamic era beginning with the Arab Ummayad conquest, then the eventual Persian-influenced Abbasids and ending with the strong influences of Turkish cuisine, resulting from the coming of the Ottoman Turks. It is similar to other Levantine cuisines, including Lebanese, Syrian and Jordanian.|$|E
5|$|Paris was {{the central}} hub of culture and {{economic}} activity, and as such, the most highly skilled culinary craftsmen were to be found there. Markets in Paris such as Les Halles, la Mégisserie, those found along Rue Mouffetard, and similar smaller versions in other cities were {{very important to the}} distribution of food. Those that gave French produce its characteristic identity were regulated by the guild system, which developed in the Middle Ages. In Paris, the guilds were regulated by city government <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> French crown. A guild restricted those in a given branch of the culinary industry to operate only within that field.|$|E

5|$|The Age of Discovery {{beginning}} in the 15th century saw the expansion of Western Europe's political and cultural influence worldwide. Because of the prominent role the strongly Catholic nations of Spain and Portugal played in Western Colonialism, Catholicism was spread to the Americas, Asia and Oceania by explorers, conquistadors, and missionaries, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> transformation of societies through the socio-political mechanisms of colonial rule. Pope Alexander VI had awarded colonial rights {{over most of the}} newly discovered lands to Spain and Portugal and the ensuing patronato system allowed state authorities, not the Vatican, to control all clerical appointments in the new colonies. In 1521 the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan made the first Catholic converts in the Philippines. Elsewhere, Portuguese missionaries under the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelised in India, China, and Japan.|$|E
5|$|The Pandurs {{arrived in}} Vienna for a {{military}} parade for the empress on 27 May 1741. The unit was headed by Trenck and included two captains, a senior lieutenant, five lieutenants, a quartermaster, an adjutant, two chaplains (a Catholic and an Orthodox Christian), two medics, 40 sergeants, five scribes, 80 corporals and twelve musicians equipped with flutes, a drum and cymbals. The musicians were called the Turkish band, after Ottoman military bands, and are considered pioneers of martial music in Europe according to Jurica Miletić. The Pandurs did not have specific uniforms—their clothes varied but were of Turkish style. Their oriental appearance was compounded by mandatory head shaving, leaving a rattail, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> use of a horse tail bunchuk instead of a unit banner.
