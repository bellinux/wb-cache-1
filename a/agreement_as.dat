This prompted a national referendum on the Charlottetown Accord of 1992, a series of amendments that included the proposals of Meech Lake as well as concerns of the broader Canadian federation. The Accord failed in Quebec and English Canada.|$|E
5|$|However, Prime Minister Churchill was not {{satisfied}} with Ironside's progress, {{especially with regard to}} the creation of a mobile reserve. Anthony Eden, the Secretary of State for War, suggested that Ironside should be replaced by General Brooke (later Viscount Alanbrooke). On 17 July 1940 Churchill spent an afternoon with Brooke and was soon convinced that they were in close <b>agreement</b> <b>as</b> to how best to defend the nation. On 19 July Brooke replaced Ironside.|$|E

5|$|On {{behalf of}} the RSK local authorities, the {{agreement}} was signed by Veljko Džakula, Dušan Ećimović, Milan Vlaisavljević, Mladen Kulić, Đorđe Lovrić and Milan Radaković. At the time, Džakula held the position of deputy prime minister, while Ećimović was a government minister in the RSK. Signatories on {{behalf of the}} Croatian local authorities were Zlatko Kos, Zdravko Sokić, Ivan Volf, Vladimir Delač and Želimir Malnar. Fischer signed the <b>agreement</b> <b>as</b> a witness. According to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia testimony given by Džakula at the trial of Milan Martić, Ivan Milas was present at the signing of the <b>agreement</b> <b>as</b> a representative of the Government of Croatia, accompanied by Joško Morić, Croatian Deputy Interior Minister. According to Džakula, no effort was made to conceal the signing of the agreement, even though the negotiations beforehand were kept secret.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the EC {{viewed the}} <b>agreement</b> <b>as</b> {{a method of}} {{defusing}} the crisis and failed to attribute the lull which coincided with the Brioni Agreement to a shift in Serbian strategy instead. The EC delegation's failure to respond to Jović's departure before the plenary meeting and the EC foreign ministers' declaration of 10 July indicating the EC would withdraw from mediation if the Brioni Agreement was not implemented only encouraged Serbia which, unlike Slovenia, Croatia, or the Yugoslav federation, {{had nothing to lose}} if the EC pulled out. In the end, the EC took credit for a rapid resolution of the armed conflict in Slovenia without realising that its diplomatic efforts {{had little to do with}} the situation on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Careful to {{maintain}} the initiative against the Byzantines, by 570 Alboin had taken their last defences in northern Italy except for the coastal areas of Liguria and Venetia and a few isolated inland centres such as Augusta Praetoria (Aosta), Segusio (Susa), and the island of Amacina in the Larius Lucus (Lake Como). During Alboin's kingship the Lombards crossed the Apennines and plundered Tuscia, but historians are not in full <b>agreement</b> <b>as</b> to whether this took place under his guidance and if this constituted anything more than raiding. According to Herwig Wolfram, it was probably only in 578–579 that Tuscany was conquered, but Jörg Jarnut and others believe this began in some form under Alboin, {{although it was not}} completed by the time of his death.|$|E
5|$|In September 1847 Busch began {{studying}} {{mechanical engineering at}} Hanover Polytechnic.

Biographer Eva Weissweiler suspects that Kleine played a major role, and that other possible causes were Busch's friendship with an innkeeper, Brümmer, political debates in Brümmer's tavern, and Busch's reluctance to believe every word of the Bible and catechism.|$|E

5|$|On 11 August, former Football Association chief {{executive}} and ex-Tranmere Rovers player Mark Palios and his wife Nicola took a controlling interest in the club from outgoing chairman Peter Johnson. Palios become Executive Chairman of the club, with Nicola as Vice-Chairman, and Johnson as Honorary President. This ended Johnson's 27-year spell as an owner, which counts the most successful period in the club's history due to three consecutive First Division play-off finishes in the early 90s and the 2000 Football League Cup Final. The next day assistant manager John McMahon left the club by mutual <b>agreement</b> <b>as</b> Rob Edwards {{wanted to make a}} change in his coaching department. Alex Russell, familiar to Edwards from playing at Exeter, joined Tranmere Rovers as the Club's new first team coach.|$|E
5|$|The Aouzou dispute was {{concluded}} for good on 3 February 1994, when the judges of the ICJ {{by a majority}} of 16 to 1 decided that the Aouzou Strip belonged to Chad.

Monitored by international observers, the withdrawal of Libyan troops from the Strip began on 15 April and was completed by 10 May. The formal and final transfer of the Strip from Libya to Chad took place on 30 May, when the sides signed a joint declaration stating that the Libyan withdrawal had been effected.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} was legitimised by {{the provisions}} of the Papal Bull Laudabiliter, issued by Adrian IV in 1155. The bull encouraged Henry to take control in Ireland in order to oversee the financial and administrative reorganisation of the Irish Church and its integration into the Roman Church system. Some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level following the Synod of Kells in 1152. There has been significant controversy regarding the authenticity of Laudabiliter, and there is no general <b>agreement</b> <b>as</b> to whether the bull was genuine or a forgery.|$|E

5|$|The {{system was}} {{published}} in 1960 {{as a result of}} an initiative that began in 1948. It is based on the metre–kilogram–second system of units (MKS) rather than any variant of the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS). SI is intended to be an evolving system, so prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international <b>agreement</b> <b>as</b> the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 24th and 25th General Conferences on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in 2011 and 2014, for example, discussed a proposal to change the definition of the kilogram, linking it to an invariant of nature rather than to the mass of a material artefact, thereby ensuring long-term stability.|$|E
5|$|There is no <b>agreement</b> <b>as</b> to {{the order}} in which the murders took place. Burke made two confessions but gave {{different}} sequences for the murders in each statement. The first was an official one, given on 3 January 1829 to the sheriff-substitute, the procurator fiscal and the assistant sheriff-clerk. The second was {{in the form of an}} interview with the Edinburgh Courant that was published on 7 February 1829. These in turn differed from the order given in Hare's statement, although the pair were agreed on many of the points of the murders. Contemporary reports also differ from the confessions of the two men. More recent sources, including the accounts written by Brian Bailey, Lisa Rosner and Owen Dudley Edwards, either follow one of the historic versions or present their own order of events.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from the League of Nations, Poland agreed to negotiate, hoping to buy time and divert attention from the upcoming Żeligowski's Mutiny. The Lithuanians sought to achieve as much protection for Vilnius as possible. The agreement resulted in a ceasefire and established a demarcation line running through the disputed Suwałki Region up to the Bastuny railway station. The line was incomplete and did not provide adequate protection to Vilnius. Although neither Vilnius or the surrounding region was explicitly addressed in the agreement, numerous historians have described the <b>agreement</b> <b>as</b> allotting Vilnius to Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|What Hasekura said or did {{to bring}} about such a result is unknown. As later events tend to {{indicate}} {{that he and his}} descendants remained faithful Christians, Hasekura may have made an enthusiastic – and to a certain extent, disturbing – account of the greatness and might of Western countries and the Christian religion. He may also have encouraged an alliance between the Church and Date Masamune to take over the country (an idea advertised by the Franciscans while in Rome), which, in 1620 Japan, would have been a totally unrealistic proposition. Lastly, hopes of trade with Spain evaporated when Hasekura communicated that the Spanish King would not enter an <b>agreement</b> <b>as</b> long as persecutions were occurring {{in the rest of the}} country.|$|E
5|$|While the Lithuanian side {{considered}} {{the agreement to}} be an enforceable political treaty, the Polish side considered {{it to be a}} minor military agreement, later superseded by a ceasefire agreement between Lithuania and Żeligowski reached on November 29. American historian Alfred Erich Senn has argued {{that it was not a}} regular political treaty, as it did not require ratification, but the presence of political representatives of both sides indicated that it was not a mere military agreement. Poland and Lithuania also disagreed about the agreement's relation to the Vilnius question, which was not explicitly addressed in the treaty. The Lithuanian side considered that the agreement assigned Vilnius to Lithuania, while the Polish side argued that it did not concern Vilnius or other territorial claims. Senn has described the <b>agreement</b> <b>as</b> tacitly leaving Vilnius to Lithuania.|$|E
