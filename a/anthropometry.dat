5|$|The use of {{anthropology}} in the forensic investigation of remains {{grew out of}} the recognition {{of anthropology}} as a distinct scientific discipline and the growth of physical anthropology. The field of anthropology began in the United States and struggled to obtain recognition as a legitimate science {{during the early years of}} the twentieth century. Earnest Hooton pioneered the field of physical anthropology and became the first physical anthropologist to hold a full-time teaching position in the United States. He was an organizing committee member of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists along with its founder Aleš Hrdlička. Hooton's students created some of the first doctoral programs in physical anthropology during the early 20th century. In addition to physical anthropology, Hooton was a proponent of criminal anthropology. Now considered a pseudoscience, criminal anthropologists believed that phrenology and physiognomy could link a person's behavior to specific physical characteristics. The use of criminal anthropology to try to explain certain criminal behaviors arose out of the eugenics movement, popular at the time. It is because of these ideas that skeletal differences were measured in earnest eventually leading to the development of <b>anthropometry</b> and the Bertillon method of skeletal measurement by Alphonse Bertillon. The study of this information helped shape anthropologists' understanding of the human skeleton and the multiple skeletal differences that can occur.|$|E

40|$|Design {{of heavy}} {{earthmoving}} equipment is {{based primarily on}} feedback from drivers. Most design studies on ingress and egress focus on the motion itself and rely heavily on experimental data. This process requires physical construction of expensive (in terms of time and money) mockups before any feedback can be obtained. Post-feedback design changes and the analysis of those changes are again expensive processes. Although the design of heavy vehicles requires consideration of human safety and comfort, very {{little attention has been}} given to simulating ingress and egress movement for these vehicles. This thesis describes the development of a virtual model to perform ingress and egress motions for heavy equipment and its applications to study the responses of operators with different <b>anthropometries</b> to different cab designs. Different performance measures are suggested and used with predictive dynamics to study human performance since human motion is not governed by a single performance measure. Optimizing multiple performance measures allows the full range of motion for all 55 degrees of freedom to be considered for simulating the task. Once the relevant performance measure was established, case studies were performed on seven different cab designs and digital human models with three different <b>anthropometries.</b> Finally, several different cab design metrics for propensity of injury, comfort, and accessibility were proposed. These design metrics were evaluated for each of the case studies. Finally, each cab design was ranked based on the design metrics to identify the best design for a range of <b>anthropometries.</b> These results help designers make decisions and plan further design changes...|$|R

Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the <b>anthropometries</b> and fitness components differences among team in Division One IPT League 2012. There were 160 participants (N= 160), consisting of players from Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM); Universiti Malaya (UM); Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM); Kolej Komuniti Kedah (KKK); Politeknik Kota Bharu (PKB); Universiti Multimedia (MMU); Universiti Tun Hussein Onn (UTHM) and Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS), where each team contributes 20 players. The age of these participants ranged between 18 to 25 years old. The participant’s <b>anthropometries</b> characteristics that were measured were height, weight and body fat percentage. For fitness level, T-test had been used to measured agility, sit and reach (flexibility), vertical jump (power), 30 m sprint (speed), sits ups test (strength) and Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test- Level 1 (VChmax). Results showed that there are significant differences in weight (p =. 04) and body fat percentage (p =. 03) while it showed no significant differences in height (p =. 28), agility (p =. 07), flexibility (p =. 97), power (p =. 81), speed (p =. 78), strength (p =. 92) and cardiovascular endurance p =. 10). In conclusion, teams in IPT League 2012 shared almost similar height and fitness level but having differences in term of weight and body fat percentage.

40|$|OBJECTIVES. We {{sought to}} {{examine the impact of}} a randomized, {{controlled}} trial of home visiting among infants with failure to thrive on growth, academic/cognitive performance, and home/classroom behavior at age 8. METHODS. Infants with failure to thrive (N = 3 D 130) or adequate growth (N = 3 D 119) were recruited from pediatric primary care clinics serving low-income, urban communities. Eligibility criteria included age 36 weeks, birth weight > 2500 g, and no significant medical conditions. Evaluation included <b>anthropometries,</b> Bayley scales, maternal <b>anthropometries,</b> demographics, negative affect, IQ, and the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment scale. Infants with failure to thrive were treated in an interdisciplinary growth and nutrition clinic and randomized into clinical-intervention-plus-home-intervention or clinical-care-only groups. The home-visiting curriculum promoted maternal sensitivity, parent-infant relationships, and child development. Follow-up visits were conducted by evaluators who were unaware of the children's growth or intervention history. At age 8, the evaluation included <b>anthropometries,</b> the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children III, and the Wide Range Achievement Test, Revised. Mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist and teachers completed the Teacher Report Form. ANALYSIS. Multivariate analyses of variance were used to examine differences in growth, cognitive/academic performance, and home/school behavior, adjusted by maternal education, public assistance, and, when appropriate, infant Bayley score, maternal BMI, height, negative affect, IQ, and Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment scores. RESULTS. Retention was 74 % to 78 %. Children in the adequate-growth group were significantly taller, heavier, and had better arithmetic scores than the clinical-intervention-only group, with the clinical-intervention-plus-home-intervention group intermediate. There were no group differences in IQ, reading, or mother-reported behavior problems. Children in the clinical-intervention-plus-home-intervention group had fewer teacher-reported internalizing problems and better work habits than the clinical-intervention-only group. CONCLUSIONS. Early failure to thrive increased children's vulnerability to short stature, poor arithmetic performance, and poor work habits. Home visiting attenuated some of the negative effects of early failure to thrive, possibly by promoting maternal sensitivity and helping children build strong work habits that enabled them to benefit from school. Findings provide evidence for early intervention programs for vulnerable infants...|$|R

40|$|Japanese women's <b>anthropometries</b> {{and their}} lifestyles have been {{gradually}} changing since 1945. Therefore, {{we conducted a}} case-control study in order to explore the relationship of <b>anthropometries,</b> physical activity and other risk factors of endometrial cancer (EC) in Japanese women. This study of EC was conducted between January 2003 and March 2008 in Sapporo, Japan. Informed written {{consent was obtained from}} 191 patients and 419 population-based control subjects. The items surveyed were body height and weight, physical activity, past history, family history, menstruation, post-menopausal status, reproductive history, and so on. An adjusted odds ratio (OR) and its 95 % confidence interval (95 %CI) were estimated with the multivariate unconditional logistic regression model. The number of pregnancies (Ptrend= 0. 004) and number of live-births (Ptrend< 0. 001) were significantly associated with EC risk. Oral contraceptive use was not significantly associated with reduced EC risk when age, area, BMI and number of live-births were adjusted. Adult obesity significantly increased the risk of EC. In addition, the amount of maximum weight gained since the age of 20 years old was strongly related to an increase of EC risk (Ptrend< 0. 001). When, age, area, BMI, and the number of live-births were adjusted, the duration of physical activity at a certain time was marginally associated with reduced risk of EC (Ptrend= 0. 050). Light-moderate alcohol consumption (0. 1 ~ 59. 9 g per opportunity) was significantly related to the decreased risk of EC even after age, area, BMI and number of live-births were adjusted (P< 0. 05). We conclude that further study is necessary to clarify the relationship between physical activity and light-moderate alcohol consumption with the reduced risk of EC...|$|R

25|$|The {{question}} of the race of ancient Egyptians was raised historically {{as a product of}} the early racial concepts of the 18th and 19th centuries, and was linked to models of racial hierarchy primarily based on craniometry, <b>anthropometry</b> and genetics.

Although widely used in forensic anthropology, some have also challenged the accuracy of craniofacial <b>anthropometry</b> vis-a-vis different human populations that have developed in close proximity to one another and those of mixed ethnic heritage.

Real-time, automatic tracing of the Doppler flow profile allows beat-to-beat right-sided and left-sided Q measurements, simplifying operation and reducing the time of acquisition compared to conventional echocardiography. USCOM has been validated from 0.12 l/min to 18.7 l/min in new-born babies, children and adults. The method can be applied with equal accuracy to patients of all ages {{for the development of}} physiologically rational haemodynamic protocols. USCOM is the only method of cardiac output measurement to have achieved equivalent accuracy to the implantable flow probe.

40|$|Abstract—The {{field of}} {{wearable}} robotics is gaining momentum {{thanks to its}} potential application in rehabilitation engineering, assistive robotics, and power augmentation. These devices {{are designed to be}} used in direct contact with the user, to aid the movement or increase the power of specific skeletal joints. The design of the so-called physical human robot interface is critical, since it determines not only the efficacy of the robot, but also the kinematic compatibility of the device with the human skeleton, and the degree of adaptation to different <b>anthropometries.</b> Failing to deal with these problems causes misalignments between the robot and the user joint. Axes misalignment leads to the impossibility of controlling the torque effectively transmitted to the user joint, and causes undesired loading forces on articulations and soft tissues. In this paper, we propose a general analytical method for the design of exoskeletons able to assist human joints without being subjected to misalignment effects. This method is based on a kineto-static analysis of a coupled mechanism (robot-human skeleton), and can be applied in the design of selfaligning mechanisms. The method is exemplified in the design of an assistive robotic chain for a two degrees-of-freedom human articulation.
