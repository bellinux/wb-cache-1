50|$|Financial {{economists and}} {{academic}} papers will usually refer to all liabilities as debt, and {{the statement that}} equity plus liabilities equals assets is therefore an <b>accounting</b> <b>identity</b> (it is, by definition, true).

50|$|The term <b>accounting</b> <b>identity</b> {{may be used}} to {{distinguish}} between propositions that are theories (which {{may or may not be}} true, or relationships that may or may not always hold) and statements that are by definition true.

5000|$|The sectoral {{balances}} (also called sectoral financial balances) are a {{sectoral analysis}} framework for macroeconomic analysis of national economies developed by British economist Wynne Godley. [...] The balances represent an <b>accounting</b> <b>identity</b> resulting from rearranging {{the components of}} aggregate demand, showing how the flow of funds affects the financial balances of the private sector, government sector and foreign sector. This corresponds approximately to Balances Mechanics developed by Wolfgang Stützel in the 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|... "Freshwater economists" [...] often {{reject the}} {{effectiveness}} of discretionary changes in aggregate public spending {{as a means to}} efficiently stabilize business cycles. Economists loosely associated with [...] "the freshwater school" [...] have found that market failures might be important both as a cause of and as amplification and propagation of business cycles. However, it does not follow from these findings that governments can effectively mitigate business cycles fluctuations through discretionary changes in aggregate public spending or the short-term nominal interest rate. Instead they find, in general, that government policies would be more effective if they concentrate on structural reforms that target identified market failures. These economists also emphasize that the government budget constraint is the unavoidable <b>accounting</b> <b>identity</b> and connection between deficits, debt, and inflation.|$|E
40|$|Does {{economic}} theory help in forecasting key macroeconomic variables? This article aims {{to provide some}} insight into the question by drawing lessons from the literature. The definition of "{{economic theory}}" includes a broad range of examples, such as <b>accounting</b> <b>identities,</b> disaggregation and spatial restrictions when forecasting aggregate variables, cointegration and forecasting with Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models. We group the lessons into three themes. The first discusses the importance of using the correct econometric tools when answering the question. The second presents examples of theory-based forecasting that have not proven useful, such as theory-driven variable selection and some popular DSGE models. The third set of lessons discusses types of theoretical restrictions that have shown some usefulness in forecasting, such as <b>accounting</b> <b>identities,</b> disaggregation and spatial restrictions, and cointegrating relationships. We conclude by suggesting that economic theory might help in overcoming the widespread instability that affects the forecasting performance of econometric models by guiding the search for stable relationships that could be usefully exploited for forecasting...|$|R

50|$|Seven summary {{accounts}} are published, {{as well as}} a much larger number of more specific accounts. The first summary account shows gross domestic product (GDP) and its major components.The table summarizes national income on the left (debit, revenue) side and national product on the right (credit, expense) side of a two-column accounting report. Thus the left side gives GDP by the income method, and the right side gives GDP by the expenditure method.The GDP is given on the bottom line of both sides of the report. GDP must have the same value {{on both sides of the}} account. This is because income and expenditure are defined in a way that forces them to be equal (see <b>accounting</b> <b>identity).</b> We show the 2003 table later in this article; we present the left side first for convenient screen display.|$|E
5000|$|A bit of {{accounting}} theory {{is helpful to}} understanding this debate. It is an <b>accounting</b> <b>identity</b> (i.e., a rule that must hold true by definition) that assets equals the sum of liabilities and equity. Equity is primarily the common or preferred stock and the retained earnings {{of the company and}} is also referred to as capital. The financial statement that reflects these amounts is called the balance sheet. If a firm is forced into a negative equity scenario, it is technically insolvent from a balance sheet perspective. However, the firm may have sufficient cash to pay its short-term obligations and continue operating. Bankruptcy occurs when a firm is unable to pay its immediate obligations and seeks legal protection to enable it to either re-negotiate its arrangements with creditors or liquidate its assets. Pertinent forms of the accounting equation for this discussion are shown below: ...|$|E
50|$|By an <b>accounting</b> <b>identity,</b> Country A's NCO {{is always}} equal to A's Net Exports, because {{the value of}} net exports {{is equal to the}} amount of capital spent abroad (i.e. outflow) for goods that are {{imported}} in A. It is also equal to the net amount of A's currency traded in the foreign exchange market over that time period. The value of exports (bananas, ice cream, clothing) produced in country A is always matched by the value of reciprocal payments of some asset (cash, stocks, real estate) made by buyers in other countries to the producers in country A. This value is also equal to the total amount of A's currency traded in the foreign exchange market over that year, because essentially the buyers in other countries trade in their assets (e.g. foreign currency) to convert to equivalent amount in A's currency, and use this amount to pay for A's export products.|$|E

For example, case sensitivity may distinguish mailboxes differing only in capitalization of characters {{of the local}}-part, although this is not very common.

5000|$|High {{levels of}} {{indebtedness}} or the bursting {{of a real}} estate or financial asset price bubble can cause {{what is called a}} [...] "balance sheet recession." [...] This is when large numbers of consumers or corporations pay down debt (i.e., save) rather than spend or invest, which slows the economy. The term balance sheet derives from an <b>accounting</b> <b>identity</b> that holds that assets must always equal the sum of liabilities plus equity. If asset prices fall below the value of the debt incurred to purchase them, then the equity must be negative, meaning the consumer or corporation is insolvent. Economist Paul Krugman wrote in 2014 that [...] "the best working hypothesis seems to be that the financial crisis was only one manifestation of a broader problem of excessive debt--that it was a so-called [...] "balance sheet recession." [...] In Krugman's view, such crises require debt reduction strategies combined with higher government spending to offset declines from the private sector as it pays down its debt.|$|E
5000|$|Keynes {{sought to}} {{distinguish}} his theories from and oppose them to [...] "classical economics", {{by which he}} meant the economic theories of David Ricardo and his followers, including John Stuart Mill, Alfred Marshall, Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, and Arthur Cecil Pigou. A central tenet of the classical view, known as Say's law, states that [...] "supply creates its own demand". Say's Law can be interpreted in two ways. First, {{the claim that the}} total value of output is equal to the sum of income earned in production is a result of a national income <b>accounting</b> <b>identity,</b> and is therefore indisputable. A second and stronger claim, however, that the [...] "costs of output are always covered in the aggregate by the sale-proceeds resulting from demand" [...] depends on how consumption and saving are linked to production and investment. In particular, Keynes argued that the second, strong form of Say's Law only holds if increases in individual savings exactly match an increase in aggregate investment.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that the Granger-causality tests are not affected by an <b>accounting</b> <b>identity</b> relationship.

Results suggest that significant factors are interest payments, R&D expenditure, foreign ownership, stock-market listing and the number of subsidiaries.
