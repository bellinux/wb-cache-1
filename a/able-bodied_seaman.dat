25|$|About 32 people boarded Boat 3, with <b>Able-Bodied</b> <b>Seaman</b> George Moore put {{in charge}} by Murdoch.

25|$|Colnett {{was born}} in Devon at Devonport in 1753, and was baptised on 18 October 1753 at Stoke Damerel parish church, Plymouth. His parents were James and Sarah (née Lang) Colnett. He had two older sisters and one younger brother. Very {{little is known about}} his life until he joined the Royal Navy as an <b>able-bodied</b> <b>seaman</b> in 1770.|$|E
25|$|When Guy Murchie {{graduated}} from Harvard in 1929, {{he set out}} on an overseas journey, not even bothering to attend commencement, packing notepads in anticipation of publishing a travelogue. He began by working as an <b>able-bodied</b> <b>seaman</b> through the Panama Canal and up to Alaska, working the rails up to Whitehorse, and rowing himself down the Yukon River, then hiking, hitching a ride, and riding freight trains down to Seward. Unable to buy a ticket, he stowed away back to San Francisco, ultimately having {{to pay for the}} ride, and from there joined ship's crews to Hawaii and then to Japan.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have got}} a capital part {{for you in the}} farce,[66] not a {{difficult}} one to learn, as you never say anything but [...] "Yes" [...] and [...] "No." [...] You are called in the dramatis personæ an <b>able-bodied</b> British <b>seaman,</b> and you are never seen by mortal eye to do anything (except inopportunely producing a mop) but stand about the deck of the boat in everybody's way, with your hair immensely touzled, one brace on, your hands in your pockets, and the bottoms of your trousers tucked up. Yet you are inextricably connected with the plot, and are the man whom everybody is inquiring after. I think it is a very whimsical idea and extremely droll. It made me laugh heartily when I jotted it all down yesterday.|$|R
6000|$|Once more, {{take the}} {{gigantic}} moa of New Zealand, that enormous bird {{who was to}} the ostrich as the giraffe is to the antelope; a monstrous emu, as far surpassing the ostriches of to-day as the ostriches surpass all the other fowls of the air. Yet the moa, though now extinct, is in the strictest sense quite modern, a contemporary very likely of Queen Elizabeth or Queen Anne, exterminated by the Maoris only a very little time before the first white settlements in the great southern archipelago. It is even doubtful whether the moa did not live down {{to the days of}} the earliest colonists, for remains of Maori encampments are still discovered, with the ashes of the fireplace even now unscattered, and the close-gnawed bones of the gigantic bird lying in the very spot where the natives left them after their destructive feasts. So, too, with the big sharks. Our modern carcharodon, who runs (as I have before noted) to forty feet in length, is a very respectable monster indeed, as times go; and his huge snapping teeth, which measure nearly two inches long by one and a half broad, would disdain to make two bites of the <b>able-bodied</b> British <b>seaman.</b> But the naturalists of the 'Challenger' expedition dredged up in numbers from the ooze of the Pacific similar teeth, five inches long by four wide, so that the sharks to which they originally belonged must, by parity of reasoning, have measured nearly a hundred feet in length. This, no doubt, beats our biggest existing shark, the rhinodon, by some thirty feet. Still, the ooze of the Pacific is a quite recent or almost modern deposit, which is even now being accumulated on the sea bottom, and there would be really nothing astonishing in the discovery that some representatives of these colossal carcharodons are to this day swimming about at their lordly leisure among the coral reefs of the South Sea Islands. That very cautious naturalist, Dr. Günther, of the British Museum, contents himself indeed by merely saying: 'As we have no record of living individuals of that bulk having been observed, the gigantic species to which these teeth belonged must probably have become extinct within a comparatively recent period.' ...|$|R
25|$|Lightoller and Wilde lowered Boat 12 at 1:30a.m. {{with about}} 30 people aboard. It was first manned only by <b>Able-Bodied</b> <b>Seaman</b> Frederick Clench and was {{subsequently}} {{put in the}} charge of Able Seaman John Poigndestre. A male passenger jumped into the boat as it was lowered past B Deck. Difficulty was encountered in unhooking the boat from the falls, requiring Poigndestre to use a knife {{to cut through the}} ropes. Several passengers from other boats were transferred into Boat 12 after the sinking and it was heavily overloaded by the time it reached Carpathia with at least 69 people aboard. It was the last lifeboat to be picked up by Carpathia, at about 8:15a.m.|$|E
500|$|Sjónám {{also offers}} a shorter {{maritime}} education of six months. It is a ship assistant education (...) which provides the students {{to be able to}} perform all kinds of work on deck and in the engine room on board a ship. The applicants must be at least 17 and a half years old and must have completed the 9 years of Fólkaskúlin. The applicants must also have a health certificate for seamen. This education together with 9 months which are required for becoming an <b>able-bodied</b> <b>seaman,</b> qualifies the alumni for the 1½ year long shipmaster education.|$|E

2500|$|Captain William Gregory {{had been}} {{employed}} by London and South Western Railway for 36 years. He {{joined the company}} in 1869 {{at the age of}} 20. His first command was [...] in 1880. In 1885, he was appointed as master of Hilda. The only surviving crew member was <b>able-bodied</b> <b>seaman</b> James Grinter. [...] He had been twice shipwrecked before. The five surviving passengers were Olivier Caroff of Roscoff, Tanguy Laot of Cléder, Jean Louis Mouster of La Feuillée, Paul-Marie Pen of Cléder and Louis Rozec of Plouzévédé.|$|E
2500|$|Boat 11 {{was lowered}} under Murdoch's {{supervision}} at 1:35a.m. with <b>Able-Bodied</b> <b>Seaman</b> Sidney Humphreys in charge. By now the lifeboats were being filled {{much closer to}} capacity, and Boat 11 is estimated to have carried about 70 people. One occupant, Steward James Witter, was knocked into the boat by a hysterical woman whom he was helping aboard as it was [...] lowered. First Class passenger Edith Louise Rosenbaum, a Paris-based correspondent for Women's Wear Daily, brought along her toy pig, a music box that played the Maxixe and {{had been given to}} her as a good luck token by her mother. She was too frightened to enter the lifeboat, but when a crew member, mistaking her toy for a baby, tossed it in, she leaped in after it. Definitely the strangest Titanic survivor, it is now part of the collection of the National Maritime Museum in London, and was used as a prop in the film A Night To Remember. Second Class passenger Nellie Becker protested her way into lifeboat number 11, after an officer placed her son and younger daughter in the boat. She was initially prohibited from entering by Murdoch, who felt the boat was already too full. But she made her way aboard. In the chaos, however, her elder daughter Ruth, was left behind and was instructed by Murdoch to head for lifeboat number 13.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lowering}} of Boat 9 at 1:30a.m. with about 56 aboard was supervised by Murdoch, possibly with Moody assisting. [...] Boatswain's mate Albert Hames {{was put in}} charge with <b>Able-Bodied</b> <b>Seaman</b> George McGough at the tiller. Most passengers were women, with two or three men who entered when no more women came forward. One elderly woman refused to board, making a great fuss, and retreated below decks. May Futrelle, the wife of novelist Jacques Futrelle, was likewise initially reluctant to board; but after her husband told her, [...] "For God's sake, go! It's your last chance! Go!", an officer forced her into the boat. The millionnaire Benjamin Guggenheim brought Léontine Aubart, his French mistress, and her maid, Emma Sägasser, to Boat 9 before retiring to his stateroom with his valet, Victor Giglio. Both men removed their life jackets and put on their evening clothes. Guggenheim told a steward, [...] "We've dressed in our best, and are prepared to go down like gentlemen. There is grave doubt that the men will get off. I am willing to remain and play the man's game if there are not enough boats for more than the women and children. I won't die here like a beast. Tell my wife I played the game out straight and to the end. No women shall be left aboard this ship because Ben Guggenheim was a coward." ...|$|E
2500|$|Boat 10 was {{launched}} at about 1:50a.m. under Murdoch's supervision with <b>Able-Bodied</b> <b>Seaman</b> Edward Buley in charge. It {{appears to have}} had about 35 people aboard when it {{was launched}}. By this time Titanic was listing to port, making {{it increasingly difficult to}} launch lifeboats from that side of the ship, as the ship's list had created a gap of about [...] between the deck and the sides of the port-side lifeboats. An attempt to board by a young French woman nearly ended in disaster when her jump into the lifeboat fell short and she dropped into the gap. She caught the gunwale of the lifeboat while her feet found the railings on the deck below, and she was pulled back on board the ship. She made it into the lifeboat safely on her second attempt. Titanic was clearly not far from sinking and this realisation led to an increased urgency to load the lifeboat; children were rushed aboard, one baby literally being thrown in and caught by a female passenger. A male passenger, whom Lowe later described as a [...] "crazed Italian", rushed to the rail as the boat was being lowered and jumped in. Neshan Krekorian, an Armenian passenger from third class, is said to have jumped into Boat 10 as it was being lowered. Among the people on Boat 10 was the youngest Titanic passenger, nine-week-old Millvina Dean, who was also the last remaining survivor. She accompanied her mother, Mrs. Etta Dean, and her older brother Bertram. Two of those aboard were later transferred to another lifeboat, and it had 55 aboard when it met Carpathia a few hours later. [...] It was the second to last lifeboat to be picked up, at 8:00a.m.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well sung, Gurney. Who made it?" [...] inquired Phil Briant, an Irishman, who, {{besides being}} a jack-of-all-trades and an <b>able-bodied</b> <b>seaman,</b> {{was at that time}} acting-assistant to the cook and steward, the latter--a half Spaniard and half negro, of Californian extraction--being unwell.|$|E
6000|$|... "What are yer {{looking at}} your vittles like that for?" [...] inquired the [...] "Bruiser" [...] of Sam Dowse, as that <b>able-bodied</b> <b>seaman</b> sat with his plate in his lap, eyeing it with much disfavour. [...] "That ain’t the {{way to look at}} your food, after I’ve been perspiring away all the morning cooking it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To be sure, I wouldn't {{give up all}} {{notion of}} a lark. A sailor with money,--and I don't believe there ever was an <b>able-bodied</b> <b>seaman</b> with more money than I had,--who doesn't lark, {{at least to some}} degree, has no right to call himself a whole-souled mariner; so I made up my mind to have one lark and then stop." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's exactly it!" [...] said Mr. Burke. [...] "'Twas pretty near midnight when {{we started}} off to run along the forty-eighth parallel, but I kept {{my eyes on the}} man at the wheel and on the compass, and I let them know that that ship was under the command of an <b>able-bodied</b> <b>seaman</b> who knew what he was about, and if they skipped to one side of that line or to the other he would find it out in no time.|$|E
60|$|He lowered {{him to the}} pavement, and, {{accompanied}} by the cook, drew off and left him to his fate. Their last glance showed them a stout, <b>able-bodied</b> <b>seaman,</b> with his head and arms confined in a jersey, going through contortions of an extraordinary nature to free himself, and indulging in language which, even when filtered by the garment in question, was of a singularly comprehensive and powerful description. He freed himself at last, and after flinging the garment away in his anger, picked it up again, and, carrying it under his arm, zigzagged {{his way back to}} the ship.|$|E
60|$|As he had anticipated, {{the soft}} tread of the savage was heard almost {{immediately}} after, {{as he passed}} on in fall pursuit. He brushed close past the spot where Bumpus crouched, and received from that <b>able-bodied</b> <b>seaman</b> such a blow {{on the shoulder of}} his wounded arm, as, had it been delivered in daylight, would have certainly smashed his shoulder blade. As it was, it caused him to stagger and sent him howling with pain to the mouth of the cavern, whither he was followed by the triumphant Jo, who now made sure of catching him.|$|E
60|$|James Walsham {{had done}} his best, during the voyage, to acquire a {{knowledge}} of his duties. His experience in the fishing boats was useful to him now, and he was soon able to do his work as an <b>able-bodied</b> <b>seaman.</b> His good spirits and willingness rendered him a general favourite. He was glad {{that he was not}} put in the same watch with Richard Horton, as, after their first meeting, the young lieutenant showed no signs of recognition. He was not, James found, popular among the men. He was exacting and overbearing with them, and some on board, who had served with him on his previous voyage, had many tales to his disadvantage.|$|E

Now mind what I tell you, priest, this very frolic will cost Congress {{the price of a}} year's wages for an <b>able-bodied</b> <b>seaman</b> in bunting and canvas for screens; besides the wear and tear of running-gear in shortening sail, in order that the women need not be 'stericky in squalls!" ...|$|E

50|$|Initially {{he worked}} for {{thirteen}} years in the merchant navy, from <b>able-bodied</b> <b>seaman</b> to captain. When he was 28 he chose definitively for ocean-sailing. In 1978, he started with its first voyage around the world, which would eventually take seven years. He made this voyage with his former wife until they separated in 1984. Their son Stefan Vairoa was born on Easter Island in 1981.|$|E
50|$|Having evidently for {{the moment}} lost desire for long-distance voyages, on 11 December 1879 Conrad enlisted as an <b>able-bodied</b> <b>seaman</b> in the iron steamer Europa. The next day the ship {{departed}} for Genoa, Naples, Patras and Palermo, returning to London on 29 January 1880. Soon after, Conrad met George Fountaine Weare Hope, an ex-merchant-service officer, then director of a London commercial firm. This was apparently Conrad's first close contact in England and it developed into a long-lasting friendship.|$|E
50|$|In 1874 Conrad left Poland {{to start}} a {{merchant}}-marine career. After nearly four years in France and on French ships, he joined the British merchant marine {{and for the next}} fifteen years served under the Red Ensign. He worked on a variety of ships as crew member (steward, apprentice, <b>able-bodied</b> <b>seaman)</b> and then as third, second and first mate, until eventually achieving captain's rank. Of his 19-year merchant-marine career, only about half was spent actually at sea.|$|E
50|$|On 6 March 1980, while Surveyor {{was tied}} to a pier in San Francisco, California, one of her crewmen fell over the side into the water between the ship and the pier. Without {{hesitation}} another crewman, <b>Able-Bodied</b> <b>Seaman</b> Wallace K. Kanahele, leaped into the water, rescued the man—who was suffering from hypothermia—and brought him to a small boat which had been lowered by another vessel. For saving his shipmates life, Kanahele received the Department of Commerce Gold Medal in 1980.|$|E
50|$|He {{had served}} as a crew member (steward, apprentice, <b>able-bodied</b> <b>seaman)</b> for over {{two and a half years}} (21 months of that at sea); as third mate, 8 months; as second mate (his longest service), almost 4 years (only two and a half years of that at sea); as first mate, two years and three months (two years of that at sea); as captain, one year and two months (half of that at sea).
