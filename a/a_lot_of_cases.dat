25|$|In general, non-medical use of {{morphine}} entails taking more than prescribed or outside of medical supervision, injecting oral formulations, mixing it with unapproved potentiators such as alcohol, cocaine, and the like, or defeating the extended-release mechanism by chewing the tablets or {{turning into a}} powder for snorting or preparing injectables. The latter method can be as time-consuming and involved as traditional methods of smoking opium. This {{and the fact that}} the liver destroys a large percentage of the drug on the first pass impacts the demand side of the equation for clandestine re-sellers, as many customers are not needle users and may have been disappointed with ingesting the drug orally. As morphine is generally as hard or harder to divert than oxycodone in <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> morphine in any form is uncommon on the street, although ampoules and phials {{of morphine}} injection, pure pharmaceutical morphine powder, and soluble multi-purpose tablets are very popular where available.|$|E

Then they'd get their feelings hurt if I charged them. I was taking in <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> but not sending out many bills." [...] In 1938, Combs accepted an offer from a law school classmate named LeRoy Combs (no relation) to join his father and uncle's law firm in Prestonsburg. Prestonsburg was closer to his wife's home in Knott County. Combs' son Tommy suffered from a form of mental retardation, {{the result of an}} injury sustained at birth. After moving to Prestonsburg, Combs started a class for people with mental retardation, in part so Tommy could attend the class.|$|E

We put no energy into the artwork or into anything. On a lot of songs, there aren’t lyrics! In <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> we never sat down to write them, because we just wanted {{to get it out of}} the way as fast as possible.

2500|$|The {{districts of}} Kohistan, Mahmud Raqi, and Kohband districts, {{all of which}} are Jamiat-i Islami and almost all Tajik, have become {{targeted}} zones of interest for the insurgency. Because they are close enough to Kabul, the militants count attacks there as attacks in Kabul. Whilst the districts of Tagab, Alasay and Nijrab are Hizb-i Islami Gulbuddin supporters and are a mixture of Pashtuns, Tajiks and Pashai. [...] The importance of Kapisa comes as it lies along the approach to the Panjshir River valley and most of the major Jamiat figures have managed to secure wealth and power in the post-2001 Afghanistan, while most of the HiG figures have not. As a result, most of the violence in the area is not actually “Taliban” as we would normally consider it, but HiG fighters (and in <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> petty thugs) calling themselves Taliban.|$|E

I thought {{it was up to me}} to compete with the Packer boys. When the Packer catchcry was [...] "Lillee getting wickets and Hookesy clearing pickets" [...] I felt that anyone who was coming to watch me play needed to be entertained. I probably played more aggressively than I should have. My feeling was I wanted to give the crowd something to look at when they came in the gates. I should have been more circumspect. In <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> I was happy to get out for 30 or 40. But I felt we needed to compete with WSC boys.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} distinction when discussing Fairtrade {{is the difference}} between Impact studies and case studies. Case studies are valuable for, among other things, researching specific systems and sub-systems, for constructing models, and for identifying problems. However, the impacts noted cannot be extrapolated generally. For instance, if a hundred dairy farms lose money, {{this does not mean that}} all or most dairy farms do. There are <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>case</b> studies on Fairtrade, but many are erroneously referred to as impact studies.|$|R

The methodology for estimate emissions from forest fires was developed {{on the basis of}} the information from EMEP/CORINAIR Task Force on Emission Inventories and, for Particulate Matter with diameter inferior to 10 microns, United States Environmental Protection Agency. The model, Air Fire, allows the estimate of the emissions produced by forest fires. The model is developed in Windows environment with object-oriented Visual Basic language and is available with an ACCESS database. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>case</b> studies will be presented. The model has been used at a national level (for the realization of a national emissions inventory) and at regional level (in the frame of emissions inventories and air quality management plans). At national level in Italy forest fires can contribute up to 4. 5 % of Carbon Monoxide and up to 1 % of Nitrogen Oxides and Carbon Dioxide emissions while, at regional level, forest fires can be up to 5 % of Carbon Monoxide and up to 8 % of Particulate Matter with diameter inferior to 10 microns emissions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{high-performance}} {{building envelope}} is the prerequisite and foundation to a zero energy building. For the non-transparent part of envelope, the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity are two thermophysical properties which can strongly influence the energy {{performance of the}} envelope. Although <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>case</b> studies have been performed on these two properties, the results could not give a comprehensive picture of the roles of thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity on the energy performance in an active building. In this work, a traversal study on the energy performance of a standard room with all potential wall materials was provided. These materials were differentiated by distinct thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity. It was revealed that the external wall requires a material with a low thermal conductivity and a high volumetric heat capacity, and the internal wall needs a material with a high volumetric heat capacity. These requirements for wall materials are consistent under various climate conditions...|$|R

40|$|Submarine {{groundwater}} discharge (SGD) {{and its role}} in marine nutrient cycling are well known since the last decade. The freshwater equivalent, lacustrine {{groundwater discharge}} (LGD), is often still disregarded, although first reports of LGD are more than 50 years old. We identify nine different reasons why groundwater has long been disregarded in both freshwater and marine environments such as invisibility of groundwater discharge, the size of the interface and its difficult accessibility. Although there are some fundamental differences in the hydrology of SGD and LGD, caused primarily by seawater recirculation that occurs only in <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> SGD, there are also <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> similarities such as a focusing of discharge to near-shore areas. Nutrient concentrations in groundwater near the groundwater–surface water interface might be anthropogenically enriched. Due to spatial heterogeneity of aquifer characteristics and biogeochemical processes, the quantification of groundwater-borne nutrient loads is challenging. Both nitrogen and phosphorus might be mobile in near-shore aquifers and in <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>case</b> studies large groundwater-borne nutrient loads have been reported...|$|R
