5|$|The most {{comprehensive}} primary source on Van Gogh is the correspondence {{between him and}} his younger brother, Theo. Their lifelong friendship, and most of what is known of Vincent's thoughts and theories of art, are recorded in the hundreds of letters they exchanged from 1872 until 1890. Theo van Gogh was an <b>art</b> <b>dealer</b> and provided his brother with financial and emotional support, and access to influential people on the contemporary art scene.|$|E

Also non-Jewish <b>art</b> <b>dealers</b> sold <b>art</b> to the Germans, e.g. the <b>art</b> <b>dealers</b> De Boer and Hoogendijk in the Netherlands.|$|R

5|$|The {{relative}} ease of making reproductions has also encouraged many forgeries: {{a survey of}} expert opinion placed Rodin in the top ten most-faked artists. Rodin fought against forgeries of his works as early as 1901, and since his death, many cases of organized, large-scale forgeries have been revealed. A massive forgery was discovered by French authorities in the early 1990s {{and led to the}} conviction of <b>art</b> <b>dealer</b> Guy Hain.|$|E
5|$|Developing an {{interest}} in modern art, in the early 1960s Hergé befriended the <b>art</b> <b>dealer</b> Marcel Stal, owner of the Carrefour gallery in Brussels. He was a particular fan {{of the work of}} Constant Permeke, Jakob Smits, Lucio Fontana, and Jean-Pierre Raynaurd, as well as the pop art movement, in particular the work of Roy Lichtenstein. He built up his own personal collection, which consisted of both modern paintings as well as African art and Chinese ceramics.|$|E

The board rejected the offer {{with the statement that}} the Old Norse motif was more appropriate for the Museum of National Antiquities, which at the time still shared the same building as Nationalmuseum. When the Museum of National Antiquities had been moved to a building of its own, the painting should be moved there too.|$|E

5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of the Netherlands, one of van Meegeren’s agents sold the Vermeer forgery Christ with the Adulteress to Nazi banker and <b>art</b> <b>dealer</b> Alois Miedl in 1942. Experts could probably have identified it as a forgery; as van Meegeren's health declined, so did {{the quality of his}} work. He chain-smoked, drank heavily, and became addicted to morphine-laced sleeping pills. Fortunately for van Meegeren, there were no genuine Vermeers available for comparison, since most museum collections were in protective storage as a prevention against war damage. Miedl then sold it to Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring for 1.65million guilders ($625,000 or $7million today).|$|E
5|$|However, {{shortly after}} {{returning}} to the French Riviera in 1929, Hunter suffered a severe breakdown, forcing his sister to bring him home to Scotland in September. He recovered, and began to paint a number of portraits of his friends, including one of Dr Tom Honeyman, the Director of the Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum from 1939 until 1954. Honeyman, at the time an <b>art</b> <b>dealer,</b> had assisted Hunter in developing his career, and painting the portrait {{may have been a}} gesture of thanks.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{early life}} {{has been the subject}} of {{historical}} conjecture. Vasari, the 16th-century biographer of Renaissance painters, tells a story of Leonardo as a very young man: A local peasant made himself a round shield and requested that Ser Piero have it painted for him. Leonardo responded with a painting of a monster spitting fire that was so terrifying that Ser Piero sold it to a Florentine <b>art</b> <b>dealer,</b> who sold it to the Duke of Milan. Meanwhile, having made a profit, Ser Piero bought a shield decorated with a heart pierced by an arrow, which he gave to the peasant.|$|E

At the time of his death, his <b>art</b> <b>dealer</b> believed that Skelton had earned more money through his paintings than from his television work.|$|E

5|$|The work {{is thought}} to have been {{completed}} as part of a set of paintings of Protestant martyrs. It was in the possession of a collector in Streatham, London, by the early 20th century. In December 2005 the portrait was examined by the <b>art</b> <b>dealer</b> Christopher Foley. He saw it as an accurate, though poorly executed, reproduction of a contemporary painting of Jane, had it verified and on that basis negotiated its sale. The work was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in London for a rumoured £100,000. The historian David Starkey was highly critical of the sale and challenged Foley's identifications.|$|E

Murray later became an important collector and respected <b>art</b> <b>dealer.</b> Between 1903 and 1907 he sold a great many works by Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelites to the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, at far below their market worth. Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery now has the largest collection of works by Burne-Jones in the world, including the massive watercolour Star of Bethlehem, commissioned for the Gallery in 1897. The paintings are believed by some to have influenced the young J. R. R. Tolkien, then growing up in Birmingham.|$|E
