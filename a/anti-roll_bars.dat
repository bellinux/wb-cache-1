5|$|The DB9 also {{contains}} <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> and double wishbone suspension, supported by coil springs. To keep the back-end in control under heavy acceleration or braking, the rear suspension has additional anti-squat and anti-lift technology. Later {{versions of the}} car also features three modes for the tuning: normal, for every-day use, sport, for more precise movement {{at the cost of}} ride comfort, and track, which furthers the effects of the sport setting.|$|E
5|$|The rear-wheel {{steering}} was {{dropped from the}} production car to save weight and reduce complexity, as was the height adjustable suspension and active aerodynamic technology. The suspension fitted to the production model consisted of front and rear independent suspension, double unequal length wishbones, inboard coil springs and <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars,</b> with Bilstein gas-filled dampers. The suspension was designed {{in accordance with the}} FIA Group C specifications.|$|E
25|$|The Enzo has 4 wheel {{independent}} suspension with push-rod actuated shock absorbers which can be adjusted from the cabin, complemented with <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> at the front and rear.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{advantage}} of the FRP transverse leaf springs—when supported with widely spaced, pivotable mounts—is the ability to supplement or replace the <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar.</b> Typically springs that provide a sufficient ride rate need a supplemental spring (the <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar)</b> to increase the suspension roll rate. The coupling of {{the two sides of}} the transverse leaf spring across the vehicle results in an <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> like behavior. Corvette engineers have cited this property as enabling the use of a lighter <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar,</b> and even eliminating the rear <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> on some versions of the seventh generation Corvette.|$|R
50|$|In MacPherson's {{original}} design, an <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> also {{acted as}} the radius rod. This requires {{the bar to}} be attached through a ball joint, so as to also provide longitudinal control. In most contemporary designs, still commonly termed MacPherson struts, the radius rod and <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> are now separate, with the <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> mounted in a sliding bush.|$|R
40|$|This master’s {{thesis is}} focused on a design of the formula student’s <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar.</b> The {{beginning}} of the thesis {{is devoted to the}} introduction of the <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> function and the explanation of its effect on a vehicle including the analysis of various constructions. Second part deals with the Formula Student competition. There is the analysis of the formula Ford’s <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> {{as a starting point for}} our own design. In the section which deals with the <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> design several alternatives are designed, the stress analysis of components are made and multi body system models are developed for final solutions. These models serve for further analyses of driving characteristics of the vehicle...|$|R
25|$|Changes {{outside of}} the engine were less extreme, but with a {{distinction}} between the third and fourth generation, with changes of the engine hood. The Tremec T56 transmission was replaced with a new Tremec TR6060 with triple first-gear synchronizers and doubles for higher gears. The Dana M44-4 rear axle from the 2003–2006 model now has a GKN ViscoLok speed-sensing limited-slip differential that greatly helps the tires in getting grip under acceleration. Another performance upgrade was the removal of run-flat tires; the new Michelin Pilot Sport 2 tires increased grip and driver feedback and, along with revised suspension (springs, <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars,</b> and shock valving), made the Viper more neutral in cornering.|$|E
25|$|The car {{now has the}} {{addition}} of the Advanced Aerodynamic Package (two-piece front corner splitters and a rear decklid spoiler made from carbon fiber), lightweight Sidewinder II wheels finished in matte-black, Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires, two-mode (Street and Race) Bilstein DampTronic suspension adapted from the GTS, but with firmer levels of damping and a smaller spread between modes, shock dampers, increased spring rates and thicker <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars,</b> carbon fiber underhood X-brace (instead of the aluminium brace in all other models), carbon fiber rear tail light applique from the Exterior Carbon Fiber Accent Package, two-piece Brembo brake rotors with wider brake annulus, black-anodized Brembo brake calipers painted with the Viper logo in TA Orange, TA logos behind both front wheels and a Stryker decal instead of the standard badge on the hood (TA Orange on the Venom Black cars, black on the TA Orange and Venom White cars), black interior with TA Orange accent stitching on the ballistic cloth seats, instrument panel & cowl, center stack, console, hand brake, shifter boot, and door panels. The aerodynamic package adds 200 pounds (90.72kg) of downforce at 100mph (160.93km/h). Top speed is 193mph (310.60km/h) instead of the non-aerodynamics package cars' 206mph (331.52km/h). The car's mileage is 12 mpg in city, and 19 mpg in highway.|$|E
500|$|The Aston Martin DB9 Volante is the {{convertible}} {{version of the}} DB9 coupe. The chassis, though stiffer, uses the same base VH platform. To protect occupants from rollovers, the Volante has strengthened the windshield pillars and added two pop-up hoops behind the rear seats. The hoops cannot be disabled and will break the car's rear window if deployed. In an effort to improve the Volante's ride while cruising, Aston Martin have softened the springs and lightened the <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> in the Volante, leading to a gentler suspension. The retractable roof of the Volante is made of folding fabric and takes 17 seconds to be put up or down. The Volante weighs [...] more than the coupe.|$|E
50|$|The front {{suspension}} was by {{double wishbone}} arms with outboard coil/damper unit. Unlike Chapman's former designs where {{the ends of}} <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> acted as a leg of the upper wishbone, the 18 had a separate front <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar.</b> The rear suspension was by upper and lower radius arms with reversed lower wishbone, where the fixed-length halfshaft acted as the upper link. The coil/damper unit was also mounted outboard in the rear, and the 18 sometimes ran with and without the rear <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|R
50|$|These models {{included}} 247 mm vented {{front brake}} discs, with the VTR and VTS also having rear brake discs (solid 247 mm discs). Also, {{a different style}} of control arms and struts {{was used for the}} suspension. The VTS had a 22 mm master brake cylinder, and the VTR and Westcoast/Furio had a 19 mm. The VTS had a 19 mm front <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> and 22 mm rear <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar,</b> while the VTR and Westcoast/Furio had a 19 mm front and 21 mm or sometimes 19 mm rear <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{the present}} paper, Fatigue life {{assessment}} of an <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> {{component of a}} passenger vehicle, is investigated by ANSYS 11 software. A stress analysis is also {{carried out by the}} finite element technique for the determination of highly stressed regions on the <b>bar.</b> <b>Anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> is a suspension element used at the front, rear, or at both ends of a car that reduces body roll by resisting any unequal vertical motion between the pair of wheels to which it is connected. As a first stage, fatigue damage models proposed by some well-known references and the corresponding assumptions are discussed and some enhancements are proposed. Then, fracture analysis of an <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> of an automobile is carried out. The analysed type of the <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> is especially important as many cases are reported about the fracture after a 100, 000 km of travel fatigue and fracture conditions. This paper demonstrates fatigue life of an <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bar</b> and then evaluated by experimental analytically results from other researcher.

500|$|The {{suspension}} {{was entirely}} new, adding adjustable <b>anti-roll</b> <b>bars.</b> [...] The brakes were redesigned {{to adapt the}} use of a driver-adjustable brake pressure balance, while the servo-activated braking system was removed. [...] A racing steering rack was used in place of the standard power steering unit. [...] Pneumatic jacks were later added to the cars in the 1980 season to allow for quicker pit stops. [...] Goodyear racing tires were used on all cars. [...] All other non-essential items from the road car were not included, bringing the Procar M1's weight down to [...] [...] The performance of the Procar M1s was increased to a top speed of [...] dependent upon gear ratios, and acceleration from 0– in 4.3seconds. [...] Each Procar M1 cost approximately US$60,000.|$|E
500|$|The suspension, which {{controls}} the relative {{motion of the}} chassis and the wheels, {{is similar to that}} of the BT48: it features double wishbones front and rear, with the springs and dampers mounted on the chassis out of the airflow and activated by pullrods. <b>Anti-roll</b> <b>bars</b> are fitted front and rear. The BT49's disc brakes are mounted outboard, within the wheel hubs, and are activated by a single four piston brake caliper for each wheel. For most of the BT49's career, it used conventional steel brakes. Lighter reinforced carbon-carbon discs and pads, a technology that Brabham had introduced to Formula One in 1976, were used in 1981 and 1982; The wheels are of [...] diameter, although occasionally [...] wheels were used at the front. The car initially raced on Goodyear tyres, but the team had to adapt the BT49 to Michelin's new radial tyres for part of the 1981 season when Goodyear temporarily withdrew from Formula One. Slick tyres were used in dry conditions and treaded tyres in the wet.|$|E
