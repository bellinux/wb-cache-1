5|$|Berrios' boss at the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals, Harry H. Semrow, died November 23, 1987 at age 72. In {{accordance}} with state law, the Chief Judge of the Cook County Circuit Court appointed a temporary replacement, attorney Thomas A. Jaconetty, 34, a deputy assessor with the Board of (Tax) Appeals since 1981. Jaconnetty was a 31st ward resident <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>secretary</b> <b>of</b> Berrios' 31st ward Democratic organization with whom Berrios {{had been a}} precinct captain in the 31st Ward under Alderman Keane.

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914, Blamey was transferred to the War Office, where he worked in the Intelligence Branch preparing daily summaries for the King <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State for War, Lord Kitchener. Fully trained staff officers were rare and valuable in the Australian Army, and while still in Britain, Blamey was appointed to the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) as general staff officer, Grade 3 (Intelligence), on the staff of Major General William Bridges's 1st Division. As such, he reported to the 1st Division's GSO1, Lieutenant Colonel Brudenell White. In November 1914 he sailed for Egypt with Colonel Harry Chauvel, to join the Australian contingent there.|$|E

5|$|Idaho {{was laid}} down on 20 January 1915 at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation in Camden, New Jersey. She was {{launched}} on 30 June 1917, and after fitting-out work ended, the new battleship was commissioned into the fleet on 24 March 1919. Shortly afterward, the ship began her shakedown cruise, departing on 13 April for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, {{before returning to}} New York. There, the President of Brazil, Epitácio Pessoa, boarded the ship to return to Brazil. The trip began on 6 July; Idaho reached Rio de Janeiro on 17 July, where Pessoa left the ship, which continued on to the Panama Canal. She steamed to Monterey, California, where she joined the Pacific Fleet in September. The fleet then {{conducted a series of}} training exercises and held a naval review on 13 September for President Woodrow Wilson. Idaho hosted the Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Interior John B. Payne for a tour of Alaska, which concluded on 22 July.|$|E
5|$|McNair had {{difficulty}} implementing {{a training program}} for National Guard units, chiefly because of their lack of prior military experience other than monthly drills and short annual training periods. He recommended a wholesale demobilization of the National Guard; Marshall <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> War disagreed, partly because they anticipated political backlash, and partly because the manpower they provided was in demand. McNair also found National Guard senior commanders wanting; in his view, National Guard officers should not progress beyond the grade of colonel, and professional full-time officers should command at the division level and above. In this, he was mostly successful; all but two National Guard division commanders were replaced by regular Army officers, and most National Guard generals carried out stateside assignments, or non-combat overseas assignments. Some served in roles below division commander (such as assistant division commander), or carried out administrative and training roles, such as provost marshal or school commandant. In addition, some accepted reductions in rank so they could serve in overseas assignments.|$|E
5|$|Michigans keel {{was laid}} down on 17 December 1906, {{one day before}} South Carolina. After the initial {{construction}} periods, the ships were launched on 26 May and 11 July 1908 (respectively). Michigan was {{slightly more than half}} complete when launched, and the ship was christened by Carol Newberry, the daughter of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Truman Handy Newberry. The warship was billed as epoch-making, and the spectacle drew many prominent individuals, including the governor and lieutenant-governor of Michigan, the governor of New Jersey, the mayor of Detroit, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Interior Department, along with many naval admirals and constructors. Like its sister ship, South Carolina was just over halfway completed when it was launched. The accompanying ceremony took place just after noon and was attended by many notable residents of the state of South Carolina, including Governor Martin Frederick Ansel. His daughter Frederica christened the ship.|$|E

5|$|One {{hundred and}} sixty-two Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry were arrested. Between 23 November and 26 December 1952, ninety-five {{soldiers}} were court martialed and tried by General Court-Martial in fifteen separate trials. Ninety-one {{were found guilty}} and sentenced to prison terms ranging from one to 18 years of hard labor. It was the largest mass court-martial of the Korean War. According to cultural historian Silvia Álvarez Curbelo, the government of Puerto Rico, {{caught in the middle}} of a potentially damaging affair that could jeopardize its political agenda, kept silent for nearly two months. Finally, the incidents were made known by a local newspaper alerted by several letters written by the imprisoned soldiers to their families. Secret negotiations between the U.S. and Puerto Rican governments took place <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Army Robert T. Stevens moved quickly to remit the sentences and granted clemency and pardons to all those involved.|$|E
5|$|Texas has a plural {{executive}} branch system limiting {{the power of}} the governor, which is a weak executive compared to some other states. Except for the Secretary of State, voters elect executive officers independently; thus candidates are directly answerable to the public, not the governor. This election system has led to some {{executive branch}}es split between parties and reduced the ability of the governor to carry out a program. When Republican President George W. Bush served as Texas's governor, the state had a Democratic lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock. The executive branch positions consist of the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Comptroller of Public Accounts, Land Commissioner, Attorney General, Agriculture Commissioner, the three-member Texas Railroad Commission, the State Board of Education, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State.|$|E
5|$|The Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) is {{normally}} the highest-ranking {{officer in the}} United States Marine Corps {{and is a member}} of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

5|$|The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) {{was passed}} on October 21, 1972 under {{president}} Richard Nixon {{to prevent the}} further depletion and possible extinction of marine mammal stocks. It prohibits the taking ("the act of hunting, killing, capture, and/or harassment of any marine mammal; or, the attempt at such") of any marine mammal without a permit issued by the Secretary. Authority to manage the MMPA was divided between the Secretary of the Interior through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> Commerce, which is delegated to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) was established to review existing policies and make recommendations to the Service and NOAA to better implement the MMPA. The Service is responsible for ensuring the protection of sea otters and marine otters, walruses, polar bears, the three species of manatees, and dugongs; and NOAA was given responsibility to conserve and manage pinnipeds (excluding walruses) and cetaceans.|$|E
5|$|The music {{industry}} {{was in a}} period of transition at the time the song was published as new technologies allowed music to be recorded. U.S. copyright laws at the time did not allow music composers to control the distribution of phonograph cylinders or music rolls for player pianos. Edison Records paid popular singers like Harry Macdonough to sing the songs and then sold the recordings without paying any royalties to the composer or publisher of the music. Dresser joined with other prominent composers to seek a change in U.S. copyright laws. In 1902 Dresser met with U.S. senators <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State in Washington, D.C. He also submitted papers with the U.S. State Department asking for an extension of copyright protection outside the United States, especially in Canada and England.|$|E
5|$|Aiyer sent Ramanujan, {{with letters}} of introduction, to his {{mathematician}} friends in Madras. Some {{of them looked}} at his work and gave him letters of introduction to R. Ramachandra Rao, the district collector for Nellore <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Indian Mathematical Society. Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted {{that it was his}} own work. Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable Bombay mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of understanding of his work but concluded that he was not a phony. Ramanujan's friend C. V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and listened as Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his theory of divergent series, which Rao said ultimately converted him to a belief in Ramanujan's brilliance. When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research, with Rao's financial aid taking care of his daily needs. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.|$|E

He was involved in both solitary and group expeditions into the Austrian Alps, and it was on one of the latter journeys that he left his mountaineering group to spend Midsummer night alone atop the Geiselberg hillfort.

5|$|At 15:05, {{the train}} {{disappeared}} from the approach zone for the Vendenheim junction on the display being monitored by staff at the signalling control center. At 15:10, the control center initiated emergency procedures {{for the loss of}} a train and closed the non-high-speed rail lines that pass through the Vendenheim junction. At approximately the same time, one of the companies involved {{in the construction of the}} line received a call from an employee aboard the train, who informed them of the derailment. Shortly before 17:45, the local mass casualty plan was enacted. Emergency medical and fire rescue services along with 100 gendarmes responded to the incident. At its height, 104 engines from three départments responded to the incident—65 from Bas-Rhin and 39 from Moselle and Haut-Rhin. Those with minor injuries were treated by responders from the French Red Cross, which operated at the school in Eckwersheim. The French Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, Ségolène Royal, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State for Transport, Alain Vidalies, travelled to the site shortly after the crash.

After the investiture ceremony at Windsor is concluded, a state luncheon is held in the Banqueting Room. This is attended by the royal family, by all the Companions of the Order and their spouses, and by the Officers of the Order. After the banquet all the knights and ladies of the order, together with the prelate, chancellor and other officers of the order, in their mantles and ceremonial robes, led by the Military Knights of Windsor, move in procession, watched by a great crowd of spectators, through the castle, down the hill, which is lined with troops, to Saint George's Chapel for a worship service, before which the formal installation of the new knights takes place.|$|E
