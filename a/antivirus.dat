40|$|While {{there are}} {{numerous}} Trojans {{out there in the}} internet, all of them are easily detected by <b>antiviruses</b> or blocked by firewalls. Apart from that, they are also easily detected and removed by any user with a good knowledge in Operating System and Security. This project’s objective is, therefore, to identify and remove the design flaws, add some improvements and features to make it undetectable. <b>Antiviruses</b> identify a threat mostly based on two factors. Either signature matching or heuristic analysis based of certain suspicious behaviors and patterns. This project here doesn’t consider the Blacklisting feature of an Anti-Virus. Now to avoid detection based on the other two factors, the main objective is to make the Trojan look like a normal legal program. To achieve this, the best way is to use the legal and secure facilities provided by Windows itself. This way, the Trojan will install and work similar to any other software; however, everything will be done stealthily. Apart from the traditional objective of giving backdoor access to victim’s computer, this Trojan here includes another objective of Bypassing firewalls and protecting itself for functioning properly as well. There is a tradeoff too and that needs to be mentioned before we proceed further. This tradeoff is between size and detection. The technique that is applied here to make this Trojan perfect will certainly increase its size. While traditional Trojans are less than 50 KB in size, the proposed Trojan will be more than 400 KB.

40|$|Machine {{learning}} {{techniques are}} widely used in many fields. One of the applications of machine learning {{in the field of}} information security is classification of a computer behavior into malicious and benign. <b>Antiviruses</b> consisting of signature-based methods are helpless against new (unknown) computer worms. This paper focuses on the feasibility of accurately detecting unknown worm activity in individual computers while minimizing the required set of features collected from the monitored computer. A comprehensive experiment for testing the feasibility of detecting unknown computer worms, employing several computer configurations, background applications, and user activity, was performed. During the experiments 323 computer features were monitored by an agent that was developed. Four feature selection methods were used {{to reduce the number of}} features and four learning algorithms were applied on the resulting feature subsets. The evaluation results suggest that by using classification algorithms applied on only 20 features the mean detection accuracy exceeded 90 %, and for specific unknown worms accuracy reached above 99 %, while maintaining a low level of false positive rate. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The recent {{growth in}} network usage has {{motivated}} {{the creation of}} new malicious code for various purposes. Today‘s signature-based <b>antiviruses</b> are very accurate for known malicious code, but can not detect new malicious code. Recently, classification algorithms were used successfully for the detection of unknown malicious code. But, these studies involved a test collection with a limited size and the same malicious: benign file ratio in both the training and test sets, a situation which does not reflect real-life conditions. We present a methodology for the detection of unknown malicious code, which examines concepts from text categorization, based on n-grams extraction from the binary code and feature selection. We performed an extensive evaluation, consisting of a test collection of more than 30, 000 files, in which we investigated the class imbalance problem. In real-life scenarios, the malicious file content is expected to be low, about 10 % of the total files. For practical purposes, it is unclear as to what the corresponding percentage in the training set should be. Our results indicate that greater than 95 % accuracy can be achieved {{through the use of a}} training set that has a malicious file content of less than 33. 3 %...|$|R

40|$|Security is an {{important}} aspect in our daily life. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are developed to be the defense against security threats. Current signature based IDS like firewalls and <b>antiviruses,</b> which rely on labeled training data, generally cannot detect novel attacks. The {{purpose of this study}} is to improve the performance of IDS in terms of detection accuracy and reduce False Alarm Rate (FAR). Clustering is {{an important}} task in data mining that is used in IDS applications to detect novel attacks. Clustering refers to grouping together data objects so that objects within a cluster are similar to one another, while objects in different clusters are dissimilar. K-Means is a simple and efficient algorithm that is widely used for data clustering. However, its performance depends on the initial state of centroids and may trap in local optima. The Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) is one effective method for searching problem space to find a near optimal solution. In this study, a hybrid approach based on GSA and k-Means (GSA-kMeans), which uses the advantages of both algorithms, is presented. The performance of GSA-kMeans is compared with other well-known algorithms, including k-Means and Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA).

The methods which are utilized by attackers to collect confidential information vary, when online banking systems continue to be the main goal of these attacks. Nowadays most widespread approach to protect against phishing attack is using blacklists in <b>antiviruses</b> and browser toolbars. Unfortunately, blacklist method fails in responding to newly emanating phishing attacks since registering new domain names has become easier, no comprehensive blacklist can ensure a perfect up-to-date database. Therefore it requires another approach to counter phishing attack which is more accurate and efficient than blacklist method. The purpose of this work is to evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of applying machine learning algorithms such as an Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machines and K-nearest Neighbor to website phishing detection. The datasets of phishing and non-phishing websites were gathered in order to train, test machine learning algorithm models, compare evaluative metrics of algorithms between each other.

40|$|Android {{security}} is built upon a permission-based mechanism, which restricts access of third-party Android applications to critical resources on an Android device. The user must accept {{the set of}} permissions that an application requires, before the installation proceeds. This is to inform the user {{about the risks of}} installing and using an application. It has two problems. The first one is that users are not aware enough of existing threats and trust either the application store or the popularity of the application and accept the installation without analysing the intentions of the developer. The second one is that Android does not display the specific resource needed by the application and the corresponding permissions during its installation. It rather presents different categories representing the set of resources with a description. The categories include implicitly permissions necessary to access some resources. The user grants more authorisations than necessary probably confused by the management of permissions, increasing the difficulty of detecting malicious applications and constituting the basis for many attacks. The thesis defines a system for detecting Android malware based only on requested permissions. It focuses on 222 permissions including some exclusively for third-party applications. It is a static analysis technique, which combines two reliable strategies. The the first one focuses on the discriminating metric based on the frequency of permissions and the proportion of requests by malicious applications within the whole sample. The second one relies on security risks related to granting permissions. A comparison has shown that the four protection levels of permissions defined by Google are coarse-grained, hiding the real sense of permissions. The first strategy is fine-grained and more precise in terms of permission semantics. We collected a dataset with 6783 malicious and 1993 normal applications, which have been tested and validated. Profiles for each sample have been generated, depending on both strategies and used as input for training and learning processes. Seven classifiers have been applied to the models to output performance results. We select the good ones to define our classifier, which provides outstanding performance in detection and prediction. A dataset of associations of permissions to weights that can be reused in a different research has been released from our work. Evaluations indicate that our model {{is one of the best}} tools with only requested permissions as a feature. It is able to detect around 99. 20 % of 1260 cases of malware released by the Genome project, which represents behaviour of nowadays malware. This work provides a scheme for weighting permissions possibly applicable to an unknown samples dataset, while keeping a good performance in classification. The model is good in detecting Android malware with around 97 % of the True Positive Rate and predicting Android malware with around 95 % of the True Positive Rate. This means that it is capable to discriminate almost all cases of malware in detection and prediction. The Area Under Curve (AUC) metric is between 97 % and 99 %, which confers the outsatnding property of the outstanding detection system for the detection of malware. We propose additionally a system that can be embedded into an Android hand-held device for real-time detection.
