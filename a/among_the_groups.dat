5|$|For the 2010â€“2011 {{academic}} year, Florida Atlantic had approximately 300registered student organizations. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> are academic organizations, honor societies, spiritual/religious organizations, diversity-appreciation organizations, service organizations, {{personal interest}} organizations, sports clubs, and student government agencies. These clubs and organizations {{run the gamut}} from sailing to Ultimate Frisbee, from varsity and club sports and a jazz group to a pottery guild, from political organizations to chess and video game clubs. These organizations are funded by student tuition, from which $10.00 per credit hour goes toward an activities and service fee fund. This generates approximately $9million that is then given to student government for allocation to student clubs and organizations. The student government also finances other student life programs, including career fairs, the University Press, OWL TV and Owl Radio, and Homecoming.|$|E

5|$|This {{impacted}} amphibians {{in particular}} {{in a number of}} ways. The enormous drop in sealevel due to greater quantities of the world's water being locked into glaciers profoundly affected the distribution and size of the semiaquatic ecosystems which amphibians favored, and the significant cooling of the climate further narrowed the amount of new territory favorable to amphibians. Given that among the hallmarks of amphibians are an obligatory return to a body of water to lay eggs, a delicate skin prone to desiccation (thereby often requiring the amphibian to be relatively close to water throughout its life), and a reputation of being a bellwether species for disrupted ecosystems due to the resulting low resilience to ecological change, amphibians were particularly devastated, with the Labyrinthodonts <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> faring worst. In contrast, reptiles - whose amniotic eggs have a membrane that enables gas exchange out of water, and which thereby can be laid on land - were better adapted to the new conditions. Reptiles invaded new niches at a faster rate and began diversifying their diets, becoming herbivorous and carnivorous, rather than feeding exclusively on insects and fish. Meanwhile, the severely impacted amphibians simply could not out-compete reptiles in mastering the new ecological niches, and so were obligated to pass the tetrapod evolutionary torch to the increasingly successful and swiftly radiating reptiles.|$|E

25|$|Among its grants, the United States Department of Labor awarded International Justice Mission {{a three-year}} {{cooperative}} agreement on September 30, 2002.

Then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell provided the organization with a $1 million grant to combat sex trafficking in Southeast Asia in 2004. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded a $5 million grant in 2006.

25|$|Wilderness {{designation}} {{was opposed}} by the Oregon Cattleman's Association and a non-profit group devoted to trail access for OHVs. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> that supported wilderness designation were the Oregon Natural Desert Association (ONDA), the Bend city commissioners, and a rancher named Ray Clarno, who held a grazing permit within the proposed wilderness area. Clarno, alleging that off-road riders cut his fences and left cattle gates open, promised to retire his grazing rights if OHVs were barred from the area. He followed through on this promise in 2005, when the BLM banned OHVs from the Badlands. ONDA estimated the cost of buying out grazing permits from {{a total of four}} affected ranchers at about $100,000.|$|E

25|$|The {{growing number}} of Protestants, Evangelicals and Word of God Catholics {{challenging}} traditional authority has caused religious strife {{in a number of}} indigenous communities. Tensions have been strong, at times, especially in rural areas such as San Juan Chamula. Tension <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> reached its peak in the 1990s with {{a large number of people}} injured during open clashes. In the 1970s, caciques began to expel dissidents from their communities for challenging their power, initially with the use of violence. By 2000, more than 20,000 people had been displaced, but state and federal authorities did not act to stop the expulsions. Today, the situation has quieted but the tension remains, especially in very isolated communities.|$|E
25|$|Kamenev {{continued}} to oppose Stalin throughout 1926 and 1927, resulting in his expulsion from the Central Committee in October 1927. After {{the expulsion of}} Zinoviev and Trotsky from the Communist Party on 12 November 1927, Kamenev was the United Opposition's chief spokesman within the Party, representing its position at the XVth Party Congress in December 1927. Kamenev used the occasion to appeal for reconciliation <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups.</b> His speech was interrupted 24 times by his opponents - Bukharin, Ryutin, and Kaganovich, {{making it clear that}} Kamenev's attempts were futile. The Congress declared United Opposition views incompatible with Communist Party membership; it expelled Kamenev and dozens of leading Oppositionists from the Party. This paved the way for mass expulsions in 1928 of rank-and-file Oppositionists, as well as sending prominent Left Oppositionists into internal exile.|$|E
25|$|Another wave of Indian {{immigrants}} {{entered the}} US after independence of India. A {{large proportion of}} them were Hindus joining their family members under the new more (though not completely) colour-blind immigration laws, then Malayali immigrants from Middle East, Kerala etc. and professionals or students that came from all over India. The Cold War created a need for engineers in the defence and aerospace industries, some of whom came from India. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, large numbers of Gujaratis, Telugu, and Tamil people had settled in the US. The most recent and probably the largest wave of immigration to date occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s during the internet boom. As a result, Indians in the US are {{now one of the}} largest <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> of immigrants with an estimated population of about 3.2 million, or ~1.0% of the US population according to American Community Survey of 2010 data.
