5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS) {{occurs when}} gas, {{which has been}} breathed under high pressure and dissolved into the body tissues, forms bubbles as the pressure is reduced on ascent from a dive. The results may range from pain in the joints where the bubbles form to blockage of an artery leading to damage to the nervous system, paralysis or death. While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the U.S. Navy, with neurological symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS is very rare in divers. The table below classifies the effects by <b>affected</b> <b>organ</b> and bubble location.|$|E
25|$|Early {{studies showed}} that, when {{inflammation}} is induced, the <b>affected</b> <b>organ</b> unexpectedly develops an enormous capacity to generate prostaglandins. It was {{demonstrated that the}} increase is due to de novo synthesis of fresh enzyme. In 1991, during {{the investigation of the}} expression of early-response genes in fibroblasts transformed with Rous sarcoma virus, a novel mRNA transcript that was similar, but not identical, to the seminal COX enzyme was identified. It was suggested that an isoenzyme of COX had been discovered. Another group discovered a novel cDNA species encoding a protein with similar structure to COX-1 while studying phorbol-ester-induced genes in Swiss 3T3 cells. The same laboratory showed that this gene truly expressed a novel COX enzyme. The two enzymes were renamed COX-1, referring to the original enzyme and COX-2.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol {{embolism}} (often cholesterol crystal embolism or atheroembolism, sometimes blue toe or purple toe syndrome or trash foot or warfarin blue toe syndrome) {{occurs when}} cholesterol is released, usually from an atherosclerotic plaque, and travels as an embolus {{in the bloodstream}} to lodge (as an embolism) causing an obstruction in blood vessels further away. Most commonly this causes skin symptoms (usually livedo reticularis), gangrene of the extremities and sometimes renal failure; problems with other organs may arise, depending on the site at which the cholesterol crystals enter the bloodstream. When the kidneys are involved, the disease {{is referred to as}} atheroembolic renal disease (AERD). The diagnosis usually involves biopsy (removing a tissue sample) from an <b>affected</b> <b>organ.</b> Cholesterol embolism is treated by removing the cause and giving supportive therapy; statin drugs have been found to improve the prognosis.|$|E

50|$|Consistent {{with this}} hypothesis, autoantibodies to alpha-enolase {{have been found}} to be {{associated}} with Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Since enolase is the penultimate step in glycolysis, if it were inhibited (for example by being bound by autoantibodies) one would expect decreased energy production by each cell, leading to resulting atrophy of the <b>affected</b> <b>organ.</b>|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{includes}} chemotherapy and, where practical, {{removal of}} the tumor with the <b>affected</b> <b>organ,</b> such as with a splenectomy. Splenectomy alone gives an average survival time of 1-3 months.

50|$|Inflammatory {{swelling}} may {{be either}} acute or chronic. The presentations of acute swellings are redness, local fever, pain and impairment of {{function of the}} <b>affected</b> <b>organ.</b> The related lymph nodes will be affected and will show signs of acute lymphadenitis. Chronic inflammatory swellings will show the signs of acute inflammatory swellings, but in subdued form. In this case, edema might not occur. Chronic swellings can be differentiated from neoplastic swellings {{by the fact that}} neoplastic swellings never recede in size, but inflammatory swellings may show occasional diminution.|$|E
50|$|Sarcoidosis {{involves}} the skin in between 9 and 37% of persons {{and is more}} common in African Americans than in European Americans. The skin is the second most commonly <b>affected</b> <b>organ</b> after the lungs. The most common lesions are erythema nodosum, plaques, maculopapular eruptions, subcutaneous nodules, and lupus pernio. Treatment is not required, since the lesions usually resolve spontaneously in two to four weeks. Although it may be disfiguring, cutaneous sarcoidosis rarely causes major problems. Sarcoidosis of the scalp presents with diffuse or patchy hair loss.|$|E

5000|$|On {{necropsy}} the <b>affected</b> <b>organs</b> appear dilated and {{may include}} the crop, proventriculus, ventriculus, and small intestine. On histopathological examination the tissues will contain a lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the peripheral and central nervous tissue. The causative virus {{is believed to}} commonly affect the myenteric plexuses which will also lead to the presentation of atrophied smooth muscle within the <b>affected</b> gastrointestinal <b>organs.</b> [...] It is this atrophy and loss of tone in the organs that causes the dilation and subsequent gastrointestinal symptoms which are commonly {{the first sign of}} disease for the owners.|$|R
5000|$|Aphagia is the {{inability}} or refusal to swallow. The word {{is derived from}} the Ancient Greek prefix α, meaning [...] "not" [...] or [...] "without," [...] and the suffix φαγία, derived from the verb φαγεῖν, meaning [...] "to eat." [...] It is related to dysphagia which is difficulty swallowing (Greek prefix δυσ, dys, meaning difficult, or defective), and odynophagia, painful swallowing (from ὀδύνη, odyn(o), meaning [...] "pain"). Aphagia may be temporary or long term, depending on the <b>affected</b> <b>organ.</b> It is an extreme, life-threatening case of dysphagia. Depending on the cause, untreated dysphagia may develop into aphagia.|$|E
50|$|AL {{amyloidosis}} {{can affect}} {{a wide range}} of organs, and consequently present with a range of symptoms. The kidneys are the most commonly <b>affected</b> <b>organ</b> in AL amyloidosis. Symptoms of kidney disease and renal failure can include fluid retention, swelling, and shortness of breath.In addition to kidneys, AL amyloidosis may affect the heart, peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, blood, lungs and skin. Heart complications, which affect {{more than a third of}} AL patients, include heart failure and irregular heart beat. Other symptoms can include stroke, gastrointestinal disorders, enlarged liver, diminished spleen function, diminished function of the adrenal and other endocrine glands, skin color change or growths, lung problems, bleeding and bruising problems, fatigue and weight loss.|$|E

5000|$|Typical upper {{extremity}} symptoms are paresis (i.e., weakness of voluntary movement, or partial loss of voluntary movement or impaired movement), numbness, and paresthesias (“pins and needles” sensation) after carrying {{a heavy load}} with shoulder-straps of a backpack, or similar burden. The syndrome is generally painless. Neuralgic pain, as seen with other acute brachial neuropathies (see Parsonage-Turner syndrome), is not a feature. The long thoracic nerve is often the critically <b>affected</b> <b>organ.</b> (In this case the serratus anterior muscle is palsied and a [...] "winged scapula" [...] may be the result.) The shoulder girdle and elbow flexors are usually the most severely affected. Sensory disturbances can occur in the lateral shoulder and arm region and in forearm and hand (especially the radial aspects). Atrophy of the affected muscles may develop long term in a minority of cases.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} proteopathy can trace its origins to the mid-19th century, when, in 1854, Rudolf Virchow {{coined the term}} amyloid ("starch-like") to {{describe}} a substance in cerebral corpora amylacea that exhibited a chemical reaction resembling that of cellulose. In 1859, Friedreich and Kekulé demonstrated that, rather than consisting of cellulose, [...] "amyloid" [...] actually is rich in protein. [...] Subsequent {{research has shown that}} many different proteins can form amyloid, and that all amyloids have in common birefringence in cross-polarized light after staining with the dye Congo Red, as well as a fibrillar ultrastructure when viewed with an electron microscope. [...] However, some proteinaceous lesions lack birefringence and contain few or no classical amyloid fibrils, such as the diffuse deposits of Aβ protein in the brains of Alzheimer patients. [...] Furthermore, evidence has emerged that small, non-fibrillar protein aggregates known as oligomers are toxic to the cells of an <b>affected</b> <b>organ,</b> and that amyloidogenic proteins in their fibrillar form may be relatively benign.|$|E
50|$|There are no {{well known}} and settled {{treatments}} for O. gallopava infection yet. So far, the most effective treatment is early diagnosis of the infection. Also, antifungal drug therapy and surgical excision {{can be used to}} treat the infection separately or together. O. gallopava infection treatment widely use antifungal drugs such as amphotericin B, itraconazole, triazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, posaconazole, and many others. Also, surgical excision can play a role in treatment of O. gallopava infection. This method is useful to remove lesions formed in the <b>affected</b> <b>organ</b> due to phaeohyphomycosis. Surgical resection is especially recommended for removal of CNS lesions. However, both antifungal drugs and surgical excision do not guarantee the perfect cure; there are some reported cases of relapse of the disease. These drugs and surgical methods are the most effective when the fungus is yet disseminated into the brain. Survival rate of the infection varies among individuals depending on the locations of fungus dissemination. Without dissemination into the brain, the chance of survival is greatly increasing, from 33% to almost 100%. However, if the infection is spread throughout the body including the brain, the mortality is 66%.|$|E
