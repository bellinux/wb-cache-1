5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. <b>Active</b> <b>immunity</b> {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate {{the immune system and}} develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.|$|E
5|$|After lambs {{are several}} weeks old, lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, and castrating) is carried out. Vaccinations are usually {{carried out at}} this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later {{identification}} of sheep. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons. However, many would disagree with regard to timing. Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications. The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e. when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum {{is expected to have}} fallen low enough to permit development of <b>active</b> <b>immunity.</b> Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing. Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. Tail docking is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike. Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{continuos}} {{exposure to}} a myriad of food and microbial antigens, inflammatory reactions in the intestinal mucosa are rare. Homeostasis in the intestinal mucosa is maintained by regulatory T cells, which can be tolerized or primed to provide efficient B cell help. Two types of responses can be elicited by mucosal antigen; <b>active</b> IgA <b>immunity</b> or oral tolerance. The latter being the dominant type of reaction to almost all soluble antigens, whereas <b>active</b> IgA <b>immunity</b> {{requires the use of}} effective adjuvants, such as cholera toxin (CT) or ISCOMS. This thesis explores the regulatory role of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells for oral tolerance induction and <b>active</b> IgA <b>immunity.</b> Moreover, we have addressed the question of whether oral tolerance and <b>active</b> IgA <b>immunity</b> are reciprocally regulated or can co-exist. The governing functions of IL- 12 (Th 1) or IL- 4 (Th 2) for induction of tolerance or <b>active</b> IgA <b>immunity</b> were also assessed using gene knockout mice and ISCOMS and CT-adjuvant. Finally, we experimentally addressed the hypothesis that the type of response elicited by oral antigen administration is determined at the antigen-presenting cell (APC) level. We found that mice lacking CD 8 + T cells exhibited significantly stronger mucosal IgA responses and failed to develop local tolerance to fed antigens, suggesting a down-regulatory function of CD 8 + T cells in the normal gut mucosa. By contrast, oral tolerance at the systemic level, was clearly independent of CD 8 + T cells, but affected both Th 1 and Th 2 CD 4 + T cell functions. Furthermore, already established tolerance could not be abrogated by CT, whereas this adjuvant and ISCOMS prevented the induction of tolerance in all mouse strains tested, including IL- 4 and IL- 12 -deficient mice. Th 2 cells /IL- 4 was critical for CT-induced IgA immunity, while ISCOMS were dependent on Th 1 cells/IL- 12 activity, indicating differential regulatory requirements for induction of mucosal IgA immune responses. Oral tolerance was readily induced in both these mouse strains in the absence of adjuvant, suggesting also separate regulatory pathways for induction of oral tolerance and <b>active</b> IgA <b>immunity.</b> The reciprocal regulation of these response patterns was further indicated by the finding that antigen conjugated to CT, strongly promoted mucosal IgA responses even in IL- 4 deficient mice, while oral tolerance was prevented by the conjugation. The ability to circumvent the requirement for IL- 4 was dependent on the enzymatic activity of CT, acting on the APC, because conjugation to the enzymatically inactive, but cell-receptor binding CTB, failed to affect IgA immunity. Using OVA TCR transgenic mice we could demonstrate that clonal T cells can be either tolerized or induced to enhance <b>active</b> IgA <b>immunity</b> depending on the function of the APC in the gut and that fed antigen can simultaneously induce local IgA immunity and systemic CD 4 + T cell tolerance, arguing for the existence of separate and distinct activation pathways of the two response patterns; oral tolerance and <b>active</b> IgA <b>immunity,</b> in the gut mucosa...|$|R

2500|$|A {{vaccine is}} a {{biological}} preparation that provides <b>active</b> acquired <b>immunity</b> {{to a particular}} disease.

40|$|Free heme is an {{endogenous}} {{danger signal}} that provokes innate <b>immunity.</b> <b>Active</b> innate <b>immunity</b> provides a precondition {{of an effective}} adaptive immune response. However, heme catabolites, CO, biliverdin and bilirubin trigger immunosuppression. Furthermore, free heme induces expression of heme oxygenase- 1 to increase production of CO, biliverdin and bilirubin. As such, free heme can play a paradoxical role in adaptive immunity. What is {{the outcome of the}} animal immune response to an antigen in the presence of free heme? This question remains to be explored. Here, we report the immunization results of rats and mice after intraperitoneal injection of formulations containing BSA and heme. When the heme concentrations were below 1 μM, between 1 μM and 5 μM and above 5 μM, production of anti-BSA IgG and IgM was unaffected, enhanced and suppressed, respectively. The results suggest that heme can influence adaptive immunity by double concentration-thresholds. If the heme concentrations are less than the first threshold, there is no effect on adaptive immunity; if the concentrations are more than the first but less than the second threshold, there is promotion effect; and if the concentrations are more than the second threshold, there is an inhibitory effect. A hypothesis is also presented here to explain the mechanism...|$|R
25|$|A vaccine induces <b>active</b> <b>immunity</b> when antigens are {{injected}} into {{an animal that}} cause it to produce desired antibodies itself. In passive immunity the desired antibody titers are achieved by injecting antibodies directly into an animal. The efficacy of such an approach for immunocontraception was demonstrated {{as early as the}} 1970s with antibodies against zonae pellucidae in mice during the investigation of the mechanism by which such antibodies inhibited fertility. Because the variability of individual immune response is an obstacle to bringing contraceptive vaccines to market, there has been research into the approach of contraception through passive immunization as an alternative that would be of less duration, but be closer to market. Research done using phage display technology on lymphocytes from immunoinfertile men led to the isolation, characterization, and synthesis of specific antibodies that inhibit fertility by acting against several of the known sperm antigens.

2500|$|Maternal passive {{immunity}} {{is a type}} of naturally acquired {{passive immunity}}, and refers to antibody-mediated immunity conveyed to a fetus by its mother during pregnancy.

IgG is the only antibody isotype that can pass through the placenta. Passive immunity is also provided through the transfer of IgA antibodies found in breast milk that are transferred to the gut of the infant, protecting against bacterial infections, until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies.Colostrum present in mothers milk is a example of <b>active</b> <b>immunity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Passive {{immunity}} is {{the transfer}} of <b>active</b> humoral <b>immunity</b> {{in the form of}} ready-made antibodies.

Passive immunization is used when there is a high risk of infection and insufficient time for the body to develop its own immune response, or to reduce the symptoms of ongoing or immunosuppressive diseases. Passive immunization can be provided when people cannot synthesize antibodies, and when they have been exposed to a disease {{that they do not have}} immunity against.|$|R

2500|$|The {{birth of}} active {{immunotherapy}} {{may have begun}} with Mithridates VI of Pontus. To induce <b>active</b> <b>immunity</b> for snake venom, he recommended using a method similar to modern toxoid serum therapy, by drinking the blood of animals which fed on venomous snakes. According to Jean de Maleissye, Mithridates assumed that animals feeding on venomous snakes acquired some detoxifying property in their bodies, and their blood must contain attenuated or transformed components of the snake venom. The action of those components might be strengthening the body to resist against the venom instead of exerting toxic effect. Mithridates reasoned that, by drinking the blood of these animals, he could acquire the similar resistance to the snake venom as the animals feeding on the snakes. [...] Similarly, he sought to harden himself against poison, and took daily sub-lethal doses to build tolerance. Mithridates is also said to have fashioned a 'universal antidote' {{to protect him from}} all earthly poisons. [...] For nearly 2000 years, poisons were thought to be the proximate cause of disease, and a complicated mixture of ingredients, called Mithridate, was used to cure poisoning during the Renaissance. An updated version of this cure, Theriacum Andromachi, was used well into the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|In Europe, the {{induction}} of <b>active</b> <b>immunity</b> emerged {{in an attempt}} to contain smallpox. Immunization, however, had existed in various forms for at least a thousand years. The earliest use of immunization is unknown, however, around 1000 A.D. the Chinese began practicing a form of immunization by drying and inhaling powders derived from the crusts of smallpox lesions. [...] Around the fifteenth century in India, the Ottoman Empire, and east Africa, the practice of inoculation (poking the skin with powdered material derived from smallpox crusts) became quite common. This practice was first introduced into the west in 1721 by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. In 1798, Edward Jenner introduced the far safer method of deliberate infection with [...] cowpox virus, (smallpox vaccine), which caused a mild infection that also induced immunity to smallpox. By 1800 the procedure was referred to as vaccination. To avoid confusion, smallpox inoculation was increasingly referred to as variolation, and it became common practice to use this term without regard for chronology. The success and general acceptance of Jenner's procedure would later drive the general nature of vaccination developed by Pasteur and others {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. In 1891, Pasteur widened the definition of vaccine in honour of Jenner and it then became essential to qualify the term, by referring to polio vaccine, measles vaccine etc.|$|E

We show that NLGP pretreatment results in vascular normalization in melanoma and carcinoma bearing mice along with downregulation of CD 31, VEGF and VEGFR 2. NLGP pretreatment facilitates profound infiltration of CD 8 + T cells within tumor parenchyma, which subsequently regulates VEGF-VEGFR 2 signaling in CD 31 + vascular endothelial cells to prevent aberrant neovascularization.

50|$|M cells {{play a role}} in passive immunity, or the {{transfer}} of <b>active</b> humoral <b>immunity</b> during and post pregnancy. Infants rely on antibodies specific to their mother's intestinal antigens, which move from the mother's gut and enter the breast milk.

Even though the mechanism of this transport is not fully understood, it is hypothesized that dendritic cells and macrophages play the role of transport vehicles. In females that are not lactating, when M cells recognize antigen in the gut, they stimulate production of many Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies. These antibodies are released into the gut mucosa, salivary glands, and lymph nodes. However, in females that are lactating, M cells recognize antigen and IgA is directed from the gut to the mammary gland. IgA traveling from the gut to breast milk supply is controlled by hormones, chemokines, and cytokines. Thus, the mammary gland and breast milk have critical roles alongside M cells in mucosal immune system.|$|R
