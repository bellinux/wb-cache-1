5|$|In 1917, Einstein {{applied the}} {{general theory of}} {{relativity}} to the structure of the universe as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict <b>a</b> <b>static</b> universe. The modified field equations predicted <b>a</b> <b>static</b> universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.|$|E

There Nos.8 and 100 Squadrons engaged in attacks on Japanese positions in Wewak, each flying over 140 sorties during the month.|$|E
5|$|By {{this stage}} of Operation Overlord, German forces were of an unknown {{quantity}} and quality, but the division would be confronted by elements of Germany's 711th Infantry Division, {{a part of the}} 15th Army. The 711th was composed of the 731st and the 744th Grenadier Infantry Regiments, together with artillery and other supporting arms. Even before the invasion the German division had not been considered a front line formation, but rather <b>a</b> <b>static</b> division on anti-invasion duties, and many of its units had not been at full strength. Furthermore, many of its troops were older than was normal in a first line division, or were conscripted foreigners from Poland and Russia. Being <b>a</b> <b>static</b> division, it was hampered further by having almost no transport of its own, and what was available was mostly horse drawn.|$|E

5|$|Despite these {{production}} {{problems and}} the fact that the I-250 had yet even to be submitted for State acceptance trails, an order had been placed for fifty more aircraft on 26 February (these aircraft have been referred to as the MiG-13, which presumably would have been their designation if they had actually entered service). A new deadline of 5 July 1946 was set for the delivery of the first pre-production aircraft, but it was stymied, again, for a lack of an engine. By this time seven airframes had been completed, but all lacked engines. The first I-250 was finally accepted on 8 August and flown for the first time three days later, although its engine seals failed and a number of ignition cables were scorched. The engine replacement and repairs forced the aircraft to miss its scheduled appearance at the Tushino Air Display. It was handed over to the NII VVS (Air Force Institute) on 15 September to finally begin its State acceptance tests. All ten aircraft had been delivered by 30 October, although construction number 3810107 (Factory No. 381, first batch, seventh aircraft) was used as <b>a</b> <b>static</b> test airframe and 3810110 became <b>a</b> <b>static</b> engine testbed.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next few years, Bloom spent some £16,000 {{restoring}} the locomotive (along with some 20,000 man hours) and in May 1974 it was restored to steam once more.

Bloom was not prepared to spend further money at this time and the engine became <b>a</b> <b>static</b> exhibit at Bressingham.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} when the Persians in Asia Minor heard {{of the attack on}} Sardis, they {{gathered}} together, and marched to the relief of Artaphernes. When they arrived at Sardis, they found the Greeks recently departed. So they followed their tracks back towards Ephesus. They caught up with the Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability {{to catch up with the}} Greeks). The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to wear down <b>a</b> <b>static</b> enemy with volley after volley.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century AD, the French Port-Royal Grammarians {{developed}} {{the idea that}} the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the comparative method by British philologist and expert on ancient India William Jones sparked the rise of comparative linguistics. The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by Wilhelm von Humboldt. Early in the 20th century, Ferdinand de Saussure introduced the idea of language as <b>a</b> <b>static</b> system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> blocked <b>static</b> port is <b>a</b> {{more serious}} {{situation}} because it affects all pitot-static instruments. One {{of the most}} common causes of <b>a</b> blocked <b>static</b> port is airframe icing. <b>A</b> blocked <b>static</b> port will cause the altimeter to freeze at a constant value, the altitude at which the static port became blocked. The vertical speed indicator will become frozen at zero and will not change at all, even if vertical speed increases or decreases. The airspeed indicator will reverse the error that occurs with a clogged pitot tube and cause the airspeed to be read less than it actually is as the aircraft climbs. When the aircraft is descending, the airspeed will be over-reported. In most aircraft with unpressurized cabins, <b>an</b> alternative <b>static</b> source is available and can be selected from within the cockpit.|$|R

40|$|<b>Statics</b> is <b>a</b> gateway {{engineering}} course. Many {{students use}} their performance in <b>a</b> <b>statics</b> course {{to evaluate and}} judge their desire to continue within an engineering field. Students’ performance can be adversely impacted by misconceptions they may have regarding class content and analysis techniques. Feedback from instructors can help students navigate through their misconceptions. It is critical that this feedback be concise and timely to prevent a slip in self-efficacy, or an increase in their frustration. Both factors can negatively impact a student’s desire to persist in engineering. Implementation of online learning logs allows students a timely communication avenue that can reveal to the instructor indications of such factors. This study is designed to explore common misconceptions exhibited through learning logs in <b>a</b> pre-professional engineering <b>statics</b> class. Ninety student logs were consensually evaluated in <b>a</b> fall 2013 <b>statics</b> course delivered at Utah State University. A “discourse analysis” technique was used to review learning log data to discover student’s trouble areas within the class. Results indicate typical stumbling areas that students encounter in <b>a</b> <b>statics</b> course and allow insight into specific instruction areas {{that need to be}} refined to better deliver content to the class as well as individuals...|$|R
5|$|Some {{species of}} mysids {{are easy to}} culture {{on a large scale}} in the {{laboratory}} as they are highly adaptive, and can tolerate a wide range of conditions. Despite low fecundity, these species have a short reproductive cycle which means they can quickly reproduce in vast numbers. They can be cultured in static or flow-through systems, the latter having been shown to be able to maintain a higher stocking density than <b>a</b> <b>static</b> system. In flow-through systems, juvenile mysids are continuously separated from the adult brood stock in order to reduce mortality due to cannibalism. Artemia (brine shrimp) juveniles (incubated for 24 hours) are the most common food in mysid cultures, sometimes enriched with highly unsaturated fatty acids to increase their nutritional value.|$|E
