5|$|In Costa Rica, President José María Figueres {{declared}} a state of emergency due to flooding in that country. He sought $15million in aid from the Inter-American Development Bank. The country's government handled relief efforts through its Red Cross and federal and non-governmental organizations. The government of Cuba issued an appeal to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian <b>Affairs</b> <b>for</b> financial assistance; as a result, the agency provided $30,000, and the United Nations Development Programme provided $50,000.

5|$|In May 1919, upon {{receiving}} {{an invitation from}} fellow Jewish artist Marc Chagall, Lissitzky returned to Vitebsk to teach graphic arts, printing, and architecture at the newly formed People's Art School– a school that Chagall created after being appointed Commissioner of Artistic <b>Affairs</b> <b>for</b> Vitebsk in 1918. Lissitzky was engaged in designing and printing propaganda posters; later, he preferred to keep quiet about this period, probably because one of main subjects of these posters was the exile Leon Trotsky. The quantity of these posters is sufficient to regard them as a separate genre in the artist's output.|$|E
5|$|In {{observing a}} {{multitude}} of biographies and funerary inscriptions, Hymes states that officials in the Northern Song era displayed a primary preoccupation with national interests, as they did not intervene in local or central government <b>affairs</b> <b>for</b> the benefit of their local prefecture or county. This trend was reversed in the Southern Song. Since the majority of central government officials in the Southern Song came from the macroregion of Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian, Hartwell and Hymes state {{that there was a}} great amount of ad hoc local interests represented in central government policies.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a {{grandson}} of the King of France, raised {{the prospect of}} the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of <b>affairs</b> <b>for</b> England and the other powers of Europe.

5|$|The Green Book was {{published}} locally in New York, but its popularity {{was such that}} from 1937 it was distributed nationally with input from Charles McDowell, a collaborator on Negro <b>Affairs</b> <b>for</b> the United States Travel Bureau, a government agency. With new editions published annually from 1936 to 1940, the Green Book's publication was suspended during World War II and resumed in 1946. Its scope expanded greatly during its years of publication; from covering only the New York City metropolitan area in the first edition, it eventually covered facilities {{in most of the}} United States and parts of Canada (primarily Montreal), Mexico and Bermuda. Coverage was good in the eastern US and weak in Great Plains states such as North Dakota, where there were few black residents. It eventually sold around 15,000 copies per year, distributed by mail order, by black-owned businesses and Esso service stations, some of which– unusual for the oil industry at the time– were franchised to African Americans.|$|E

Though he had never served as a public official, Perot had experience {{as the head of}} several successful corporations and had been involved in public <b>affairs</b> <b>for</b> the previous three decades. Spawned by the American dissatisfaction with the political system, grassroots organizations sprang up in every state to help Perot achieve ballot access following his announcement. James Stockdale, a retired United States Navy vice admiral, was Perot's vice presidential running mate.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} {{was first}} governed by William Henry Harrison {{who oversaw the}} negotiation with the native inhabitants to open {{large parts of the}} territory to settlement. In 1810 a popularly elected government was established as the territory continued to grow in population and develop a very basic road network, government, and education system. At the outbreak of Tecumseh's War, the territory was on the front line of battle and Harrison led a military force in the opening hostilities at the Battle of Tippecanoe, and then in the subsequent invasion of Canada during the War of 1812. Thomas Posey was appointed to the vacant governorship, but the opposition party, led by Congressman Jonathan Jennings, had dominance in the territorial <b>affairs</b> <b>for</b> its remaining years and began pressing for statehood. In June 1816, a constitutional convention was held and a state government was formed. The territory was dissolved on December 11, 1816, by an act of Congress granting statehood to Indiana.|$|E
