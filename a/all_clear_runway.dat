50|$|Many {{airports}} {{have adopted}} APUs {{as a solution}} to high fuel consumption. Much of the equipment used to clean and <b>clear</b> <b>runways</b> will use an average of two or more gallons per hour of diesel while idling. Adding an APU will provide power, heating and cooling as well as hydraulic warming if necessary and can result in significant fuel and maintenance savings.|$|R
50|$|The {{official}} {{report of}} the accident said that the charter pilot had severe coronary artery disease, had run {{a portion of the}} three miles to the airport from a motel, and may have suffered a heart attack causing him to crash the twin-engined Beechcraft E18S into a pecan tree {{at the end of a}} <b>clear</b> <b>runway</b> with excellent visibility. Early the following week, Muehleisen was buried in Trenton.|$|R
500|$|At 18:39, while DAL 379 was in {{the process}} of <b>clearing</b> the <b>runway,</b> Flight 159 was cleared for takeoff. [...] Before Flight 159 began moving, the tower {{controller}} observed that DAL 379 had stopped moving, and called DAL 379 to confirm they were <b>clear</b> of the <b>runway.</b> [...] The captain of the Delta DC-9 replied, [...] "Yeah, we're in the dirt though." [...] The tower controller then advised TWA that DAL 379 was <b>clear</b> of the <b>runway,</b> and that Flight 159 was cleared for takeoff. [...] With the first officer operating the controls, Flight 159 then began its takeoff roll down runway 27L.|$|R

5|$|The first {{motorised}} snowplows {{were developed}} in 1913, based on truck and tractor bodies. These machines allowed the mechanisation of the snow clearing process, reducing the labor required for snow removal and increasing the speed and efficiency of the process. The expansion of the aviation industry also acted {{as a catalyst for}} the development of winter service vehicles during the early 20th century. Even a light dusting of snow or ice could cause an aeroplane to crash, so airports erected snow fences around airfields to prevent snowdrifts, and began to maintain fleets of vehicles to <b>clear</b> <b>runways</b> in heavy weather.|$|R
2500|$|Conditions at {{the airport}} were foggy, with a {{visibility}} of about one-quarter mile (0.4km). Upon <b>clearing</b> <b>Runway</b> 14L, Flight 954 began taxiing southwest and south toward the terminal, leaving Runway 14L {{by way of the}} Bridge Route taxiway. [...] It had already crossed the northâ€“south bridge that carries the taxiway from Runway 14L to the terminal by the time the first officer contacted O'Hare ground control [...] and reported that the aircraft was [...] "inside [...] the bridge", had not yet received a gate assignment, and needed to wait in a holding area until receiving an assignment.|$|R

50|$|Western jumping mice are omnivores, {{with the}} largest part of their diet {{consisting}} of the seeds of grasses and herbs. Less important food items include fruits, fungi, and insects. Population densities range from 2 to 39 /ha, with individual mice having home ranges between 0.1 to 0.6 ha, with males generally having larger ranges than females. The feeding grounds of mice can be identified by small piles of grass stems stripped of their seeds, and {{by the presence of}} <b>clear</b> <b>runways</b> strewn with grass clippings. Their nests are constructed from grass fragments, and are concealed beneath vegetation or debris.|$|R

50|$|The Petroleum Warfare Department (PWD) was an {{organisation}} {{established in}} Britain in 1940 {{in response to}} the invasion crisis during World War II, when it appeared that Germany would invade the country. The department was initially tasked with developing the uses of petroleum as a weapon of war and it oversaw the introduction {{of a wide range of}} flame warfare weapons. Later in the war, the department was instrumental in the creation of the Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation (commonly known as FIDO) that <b>cleared</b> <b>runways</b> of fog allowing the landing of aircraft returning from bombing raids over Germany in poor visibility; and Operation Pluto which installed prefabricated fuel pipelines between England and France soon after the Allied Invasion of Normandy in June 1944.|$|R

2500|$|Airports in the hardest-hit {{districts were}} damaged, flooded, and carpeted in debris, forcing storm victims {{to rely on}} helicopters, seaplanes, and {{watercraft}} to deliver storm relief.

By October 4, the Government of Jamaica and the United States Agency for International Development had donated 50 tonnes and just over 32 tonnes, respectively, of emergency supplies to the Bahamas. Private groups, local businesses, and non-governmental organizations, such as the Bahamas Red Cross, started donation drives and began distributing goods to storm victims.
