Borosilicate glass is commonly used for near-infrared to about 300nm. High borate borosilicate glasses exist also in high UV transmission versions with high transmission also at 254 nm. Glass with very low content of potassium can be used with bialkali photocathodes to lower the background radiation from the potassium-40 isotope.

50|$|In practice, {{optimization}} (and searching, and learning) {{problems are}} often NP-hard, complex, and time consuming.Two major approaches are traditionally used to tackle these problems: exact methodsand metaheuristics. Exact methods allow to find exact solutions but are often impractical as they areextremely time-consuming for real-world problems (large dimension, hardly constrained, multimodal,time-varying, epistatic problems). Conversely, metaheuristics provide sub-optimal (sometimes optimal)solutions {{in a reasonable}} time. Thus, metaheuristics usually allow to meet the resolution delays imposedin the industrial field {{as well as they}} allow to study general problem classes instead that particularproblem instances. In general, many of the best performing techniques in precision and effort to solvecomplex and real-world problems are metaheuristics. Their fields of <b>application</b> <b>range</b> from combinatorialoptimization, bioinformatics, and telecommunications to economics, software engineering, etc. These fields are full of manytasks needing fast solutions of high quality.

50|$|Fluorescence {{intensity}} detection {{has developed}} very broadly in the microplate format {{over the last}} two decades. The range of applications is much broader than when using absorbance detection, but instrumentation is usually more expensive. In this type of instrumentation, a first optical system (excitation system) illuminates the sample using a specific wavelength (selected by an optical filter, or a monochromator). As a result of the illumination, the sample emits light (it fluoresces) and a second optical system (emission system) collects the emitted light, separates it from the excitation light (using a filter or monochromator system), and measures the signal using a light detector such as a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The advantages of fluorescence detection over absorbance detection are sensitivity, as well as <b>application</b> <b>range,</b> given the wide selection of fluorescent labels available today. For example, a technique known as calcium imaging measures fluorescence intensity of calcium-sensitive dyes to assess intracellular calcium levels.|$|E
