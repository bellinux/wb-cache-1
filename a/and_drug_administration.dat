40|$|Currently, most {{surgeons}} use 27 G needles {{to perform}} intravitreal and endolymphatic administration and reflexogenic zone blockade. However, their use {{is associated with}} certain disadvantages and complications. Aim. To develop a device for intravitreal <b>and</b> endolymphatic <b>drug</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> sinocarotid zone blockade. Methods. A device for intravitreal <b>and</b> endolymphatic <b>drug</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> sinocarotid zone blockade was developed. It consists of an original adapter, 30 G carpule needle, and a syringe. Pre-clinical trials included comparative evaluation of this device and a rather well-known instrument for intravitreal <b>and</b> endolymphatic <b>drug</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> sinocarotid zone blockade (a syringe with 27 G needle). Clinical trials involved 150 patients aged 36 years and older. Results. The device consists of a syringe, 30 G carpule needle, and an original three-stage hollow adapter that attaches the needle to the syringe. The needle has a cannula to {{be attached to the}} adapter. The cannula and the second stage of the adapter have the thread with an aligning arrangement The third stage of the adapter is made in a form of a truncated cone that tightly goes into the cannula thus providing reliable fixation of the needle. The device: (1) minimizes the leakage of a drug in the course of the procedure thus providing more accurate <b>drug</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> preventing its overuse; (2) reduces complication risk and improves the safety of intravitreal <b>and</b> endolymphatic <b>drug</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> sinocarotid zone blockade; (3) improves the tolerability of intravitreal <b>and</b> endolymphatic <b>drug</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> sinocarotid zone blockade; (4)  improves personal readiness to undergo maintenance retreatment. The utility model application was filed, and the filing receipt No. 2014109466 was acquired on March 12, 2014. Conclusion. The device provides optimal intravitreal and endolymphatic <b>drug</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> sinocarotid zone blockade. </p...|$|R
