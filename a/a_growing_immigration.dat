Subject to the validity of their instruments, the evidence is consistent with a causal interpretation of <b>an</b> impact from <b>growing</b> <b>immigration</b> density to native flight and relatively slower housing price appreciation.

500|$|Other forces {{worked to}} push the new {{immigrants}} towards the cities, particularly Chicago. According to historian H.

The new immigrants were increasingly younger and unmarried. With the shift from family to individual immigration came a faster and fuller Americanization, as young, single individuals with little money took whatever jobs they could get, often in cities. Large numbers even of those who had been farmers in the old country made straight for American cities and towns, living and working there at least until they had saved enough capital to marry and buy farms of their own. <b>A</b> <b>growing</b> proportion stayed in urban centers, combining emigration with the flight from the countryside which was happening in the homeland and all across Europe.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of school context on {{educational}} outlooks and outcomes of the children of immigrants, in comparison with natives in Spain, an under-represented case in the international literature and <b>a</b> fast <b>growing</b> <b>immigration</b> destination in Europe. Using two sources of hierarchical data, 2011 Chances Survey and the 2010 Secondary Schooling National Evaluation Survey, which cluster students across schools, we investigate the factors that contribute to the formation of long term educational careers. To start with we analyze performance from both an objective (test scores in mathematics) and subjective perspective (estimation by children and also their parents of whether individual school results will allow them to proceed to tertiary education). Then we turn our attention to the adjusted educational expectations (controlled for prior performance) of children. Our results reveal the different way that school context works for immigrant and native origin children. Our multilevel regression analysis finds significantly worse school results among immigrants (test scores). Although immigrant children themselves understand the constraints that such disadvantage imposes on their future educational careers, immigrant parents seem to hold on to a rather unrealistic position. This parental optimism in turn seems to boost the career expectation of immigrant children independent of school effects. Thus while school context determines the performance of immigrant origin students {{to a greater extent than}} those of natives, the opposite is true for expectations. The formation of aspirations is more family-oriented among immigrants, and thus more positive, than among natives...|$|R

Lucky Luciano established Cosa Nostra in Manhattan, forming alliances with other criminal enterprises, including the Jewish mob, led by Meyer Lansky, the leading Jewish gangster of that period.

The debate poses some fundamental questions: Should we construct statistical categories based on ethnic affiliation to allow for the formulation of public policies directed against discriminatory practices?

40|$|Purpose: As a {{contribution}} to the endeavour of developing appropriate tools for bilingual language assessment, this paper investigates the concurrence between two new tools from the recent COST Action IS 0804 (Bi-SLI), and the differences between children across two different migrant communities. Approach: Two new tools from the battery Language Impairment Testing in Multilingual Settings (LITMUS) were used: the direct assessment tool Cross-linguistic Lexical Tasks (CLT) and the reporting instrument Parents of Bilingual Children Questionnaire (PaBiQ), which offers an indirect measure of overall language skills. Data: The participants were 36 children (4; 2 – 6; 6) of Polish immigrants to Norway or the UK. Correlations were investigated with Kendall’s rank correlation, and comparisons carried out with Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Findings: The results from the two tools correlated. The CLT results were higher in the minority language (Polish) than in the majority language, with no difference between the groups. Still, the parents in the UK judged their children as less proficient in Polish than those in Norway did. Two different accounts for this incongruity are discussed. Firstly, parents in the UK may set higher benchmarks for their children’s minority language skills than the parents in Norway. Alternative accounts of this interpretation related to differences in the parents’ socio-economic background, minority language proficiency or language attitudes are discussed. Secondly, parental report may indicate early stages of attrition of the minority language among the children in the UK that the direct lexical assessment tool may not be sensitive enough to uncover. Originality: The study used two new tools designed for multilingual children to compare two groups of children of <b>a</b> recent and <b>growing</b> <b>immigration</b> group, whose language development is currently underinvestigated. Implications: The findings underscore the complexity of assessing bilingual children’s full language competence. The cross-cultural differences documented call for further longitudinal research comparing immigrant children from different language backgrounds.

40|$|The {{movement}} towards knowledge-based societies makes {{human capital}} a critical success factor for sustained growth and development. Thus, Canada utilizes its immigration initiatives as tools for nation-building and talent acquisition. Poor domestic growth rate, steady decline in working age population, and the attendant skills shortage, creates <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> dependence on <b>immigration.</b> Canada’s immigration policy places priority on skilled worker recruitment, the objective being {{that they are}} better positioned to integrate quickly into the workplace, causing minimal burden on social infrastructure. However, this research found an imbalance between this objective and reality of labour market outcomes: Although 84 % of immigrants had university degree, against 22 % natural born Canadians, {{they were unable to}} obtain skilled jobs. Their unemployment rate was more than double, taking 15 - 20 years to achieve occupational attainment equaling their Canadian born peers. Barriers inhibiting workplace integration included accreditation of qualifications, language, lack of Canadian work experience, and employers’ concerns about culture dilution. Conference Board of Canada recently decried the resultant cost of this sub-optimization, estimating it at $ 4. 1 to $ 5. 9 billion annually. The environmental scanning research design enabled qualitative examination of Canadian workplace integration programs: utilising parameters to analyze individual program mechanism to generate reliable data on current practice, leading to findings that provide valuable insights into the framework of existing integration initiatives and program offerings, and highlighting areas were programs were deficient in provision.

40|$|The {{demographic}} {{pressure and the}} gradual urbanization in large cities determine constant housing problems. In addition to <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> and continuous <b>immigration</b> flow of foreigners headed towards the metropolises in search of better life conditions, {{there is also the}} section of the population who, {{due to a lack of}} income, or poor economic conditions, have no access to real estate market, not even to rented houses. In absence of quick responses, which fall in the common urban planning, the housing emergency puts the population in poor condition and turns into self-managed and informal responses which in turn become emergency. Although with different dimensions with respect to the megacities in the World, the Italian case presents common characteristics that, in absence of suitable preventive methods, prefigure an informal city growth. The city, a heterogeneous context that is subjected to sudden and chronic emergencies, requires flexibility and capability of adjustment to the variable conditions of all the urban systems. Therefore, the reference is to the concept of “resilience”, borrowed by the ecological approach and declined in several disciplines, as a thin border between flexibility and robustness, stasis and evolution, change of state and balance (Holling, 1973). Considering the resilience like the sum of coordinated processes, which increase the adjustment of the city and its inhabitants, the research investigates about what kind of contribution can be given by architecture to the overall resilience strategy. It examines whether there are some characteristic features (technological, typological, functional, procedural), for essential housing models which, once applied in a preventive basis since the planning phase, can contribute, even if indirectly, to the overall urban resilience by cooperating to ensure quick and adaptive responses, with low construction, management, maintenance costs, and low consumption of energy and resources...|$|R
