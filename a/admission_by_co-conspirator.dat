50|$|After the DiMarco murder, {{the police}} arrested hitman John Esposito. Esposito then implicated Ciro, who was indicted {{on the two}} murders. However, the charges against Ciro were soon dropped. The reason was that the {{testimony}} against Ciro was given <b>by</b> <b>co-conspirators</b> and accomplices and under New York law outside corroboration was necessary. Two weeks after the DiMarco hit, but before his arrest, Esposito was ordered to kill Charles Ubriaco and Ciro’s half-brother Nicholas, who were discussing peace terms with rival gang members.|$|R

In the immediate aftermath of the putsch, Pabst took refuge in Miklós Horthy's Hungary where he was soon joined <b>by</b> <b>co-conspirator</b> Walther von Lüttwitz. Despite the failure of the putsch, Pabst would often speak proudly of his involvement in the episode.|$|R

We stylise this problem by suggesting four constitutional rules of admission: free mobility, <b>admission</b> <b>by</b> majority vote, <b>admission</b> <b>by</b> unanimous consent, <b>admission</b> <b>by</b> a demand threshold for public goods. In a simple model we characterise the equilibria that result from these rules, and provide a positive theory for which constitutional rule will be chosen...|$|R
