5|$|The {{dromedary}} {{shares the}} genus Camelus with the Bactrian camel (C. bactrianus) {{and the wild}} Bactrian camel (C. ferus). The dromedary belongs to the family Camelidae. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (4th century BC) {{was the first to}} describe the species of Camelus. He named two species in his History of Animals; the one-humped <b>Arabian</b> <b>camel</b> and the two-humped Bactrian camel. The dromedary was given its current binomial name Camelus dromedarius by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 publication Systema Naturae. In 1927, British veterinarian Arnold Leese classified dromedaries by their basic habitats; the hill camels are small, muscular animals and efficient beasts of burden; the larger plains camels could be further divided into the desert type that can bear light burdens and are apt for riding, and the riverine type slow animals that can bear heavy burdens; and those intermediate between these two types.|$|E

500|$|The {{dromedary}} ( [...] or [...] ), {{also called}} the <b>Arabian</b> <b>camel</b> (Camelus dromedarius), is a large, even-toed ungulate with one hump on its back.

40|$|Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causing {{infections in}} humans is genetically {{indistinguishable from the}} virus found in <b>Arabian</b> <b>camels</b> (dromedaries) in the Middle East. Although no primary human case of MERS was {{reported}} outside the <b>Arabian</b> Peninsula, <b>camel</b> populations in Africa {{are known to have}} high prevalence of antibodies against MERS-CoV. We carried out surveillance for MERS-CoV in dromedaries in Africa and Central Asia. By MERS-CoV spike pseudoparticle neutralization assay we confirmed that camel serum samples from African countries have high prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies. Using RT-qPCR we detected MERS-CoV positives in camel nasal swabs from all different African countries from which samples were collected. However, dromedary serum and swab samples from Kazakhstan in Central Asia were negative for MERS-CoV by these assays. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike gene revealed that MERS-CoVs from Africa formed a cluster closely related to but distinct from the viruses from the Arabian Peninsula. Results from this study suggest that MERS-CoV is actively circulating in dromedary populations in Africa and the virus in Africa is phylogenetically distinct from that in the Middle East.

Udder and teat measures (using a standard reference) and shape typology were assessed by 3 evaluators from the digital pictures. Results revealed that <b>Arabian</b> dairy <b>camels</b> had well developed udders with large sized teats. Typology of the whole udder glands showed that the globular shape (47. 3 %) was the most common, followed by pear (34. 3 %) and pendulous (18. 4 %) shapes. Regarding the teats, conical or funnel was the most frequent shape (63. 2 % and 58. 7 % for front and rear teats, respectively) followed by cylindrical (26. 4 and 32. 5 %, respectively) and blew-up (8. 7 and 10. 4 %, respectively). Udder linear score repeatabilities among classifiers were moderate for udder depth (0. 69), udder floor inclination (0. 64), teat shape (0. 69), teat length (0. 64) and teat width (0. 45). We concluded that dairy camels need specific milking clusters, as well as selection by morphology for improving their machine milkability. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{accidents}} {{resulting from}} the collision of motor vehicles with wildlife occur worldwide. In the United States, Canada, Europe, the Middle East and Australia these collisions usually involve deer, moose, camels and kangaroos. Because these are large animals, the collisions are frequently associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Camel-vehicle collisions in the Middle East—especially Saudi Arabia—have risen to such disturbing proportions that definitive action is necessary for mitigating the trend. <b>Arabian</b> <b>camels,</b> weighing up to 726 kg, form {{a crucial part of}} the socio-cultural experience in Saudi Arabia, where about half a million of them are found. Saudi Arabia presents a case of habitat fragmentation, especially in rural communities, where good road systems coexist with domesticated camels.

However, the significantly (p< 0. 05) higher lipogenic content (ether extract + crude fiber) of the plant selected during the dry season resulted in significantly (p< 0. 05) higher serum triacylglycerides concentration and significantly (p< 0. 05) higher milk fat content compared to that of the green season. Although, the camels selected plants with significantly (p< 0. 05) higher nitrogen free extract content during the dry season, the plasma glucose level and the milk lactose content were significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced compared to that of the green season. The significantly (p< 0. 05) lower ach content of the plants selected during the dry season resulted in significantly lower serum calcium + phosphorus concentration, but did not reflect on the ash content of the milk.

Box 2460, Riyadh 11455, Kingdom of Saudi ArabiaSix female <b>Arabian</b> <b>camels</b> (340 ± 16. 6 kg BW) {{were used}} to {{investigate}} the effect of dehydration on core body temperature (Tcore) and some blood constituents. The experiment was performed during summer (38. 3 ± 0. 29 oC and 40. 0 % RH) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Ten days prior to the initiation of the experiment, all camels were surgically implanted intraperitoneally with telemetric temperature transmitters for continuous monitoring of Tcore. The study lasted 6 weeks and was divided into three periods: the first four weeks represented a preliminary period. Measurements were taken during the fifth week, which {{is referred to as}} the “control period”, and the sixth week, which is designated the “dehydration period”. During the latter period, water was withheld for four days. Blood samples were collected and the concentrations of glucose, total protein, albumin, Na+, K+and Ca 2 +, plasma osmolality and packed cell volume (PCV) were determined. Dehydration during exposure to heat stress affected the Tcore of these camels. This effect was not significant during the first 24 hours following water deprivation, but from 32 hours onward, Tcore increased significantly until the termination of the study. The circadian rhythm of the dehydrated camels revealed that Tcore could fluctuate only by 1. 3 oC. This increase in Tcore during dehydration was associated with significant increases in total protein, albumin, PCV, Na+ concentrations and osmolality but glucose comcentration was significantly decreased. These findings indicate that, similar to other species of farm animals, the camel is a homeotherm, capable of maintaining its body temperature during dehydration with relatively little daily fluctuations in Tcore.
