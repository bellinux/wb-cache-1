25|$|Contestants competes in <b>a</b> <b>temptation</b> {{challenge}} {{to secure their}} place in the game for another week by gaining immunity making them unable to be voted out unless they gain weight. Challenges are generally psychologically based and gave contestants the choice to act against temptations they would otherwise participate in. This is a strategic part of the game. Temptation challenges were generally screened on Wednesday nights.|$|E
25|$|In some Native American cultures, severe {{penalties}} {{could be}} imposed on an adulterous wife by her husband. In many instances she was made to endure a bodily mutilation which would, {{in the mind of}} the aggrieved husband, prevent her from ever being <b>a</b> <b>temptation</b> to other men again. Among the Aztecs, wives caught in adultery were occasionally impaled, although the more usual punishment was to be stoned to death.|$|E
25|$|Each week, after a weigh in, {{contestant}}s must cast a {{vote against}} another contestant and avoid elimination. The contestant that {{received the most}} votes left the game immediately. Contestants can avoid elimination by their team or themselves losing the most percentage of weight loss, winning immunity at <b>a</b> <b>temptation</b> challenge. Contestants make themselves an elimination target if they are a threat of {{losing a lot of}} weight {{by the end of the}} show. Elimination episodes screened on Mondays. Below is a table of voting history for what each contestant voted.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{studies show}} that, {{although}} brats move on average every 3 years, {{they do not}} grow accustomed to moving. The constantly changing environment and openness to others has a price. Rather than develop problem-solving skills, there is <b>a</b> <b>temptation</b> to simply leave a problem without resolving it. If a person does not like somebody or gets into a fight, they know {{that in a few}} years somebody will move and the problem will disappear. On the other hand, when brats marry it is generally for life; over two thirds of brats over 40 are married to their first spouse. Studies show that many brats become very adaptable {{as a result of the}} mobile lifestyle, But there is also a higher than average incidence, among a minority of military brats, of Avoidant Personality Disorder and Separation Anxiety Disorder.|$|E
25|$|After Cannae, several south Italian cities allied {{themselves}} to Hannibal: the Apulian towns of Salapia, Arpi and Herdonia {{and many of}} the Lucanians. Mago marched south with a Carthaginian army detachment and, some weeks later, the Bruttians joined him. Simultaneously, Hannibal marched north with part of his forces and was joined by the Hirpini and the Caudini, two of the three Samnite cantons. The greatest gain was the second largest city of Italy, Capua, when Hannibal's army marched into Campania in 216 BC. The inhabitants of Capua held limited Roman citizenship and the aristocracy was linked to the Romans via marriage and friendship, but the possibility of becoming the supreme city of Italy after the evident Roman disasters proved too strong <b>a</b> <b>temptation.</b> The treaty between them and Hannibal can be described as an agreement of friendship, since the Capuans had no obligations, but provided the harbour through which Hannibal was reinforced.|$|E
25|$|VNAs {{designed}} for the simultaneous measurement of the S-parameters of networks with more than two ports are feasible but quickly become prohibitively complex and expensive. Usually their purchase is not justified since the required measurements can be obtained using a standard 2-port calibrated VNA with extra measurements followed by the correct interpretation of the results obtained. The required S-parameter matrix can be assembled from successive two port measurements in stages, two ports at a time, on each occasion with the unused ports being terminated in high quality loads equal to the system impedance. One risk {{of this approach is}} that the return loss or VSWR of the loads themselves must be suitably specified to be {{as close as possible to}} a perfect 50 Ohms, or whatever the nominal system impedance is. For a network with many ports there may be <b>a</b> <b>temptation,</b> on grounds of cost, to inadequately specify the VSWRs of the loads. Some analysis will be necessary to determine what the worst acceptable VSWR of the loads will be.|$|E
60|$|The {{greatest}} part {{of professors}} now-a-days take up {{their time in}} contracting of guilt, and asking for pardon, and yet are not much the better. Whereas, if they had but the grace to add to their faith, virtue, &c., they might have more peace, live better lives, and not have their heads so often in a bag as they have. 'To him that ordereth his conversation aright, will I show the salvation of God' (Psa 50:23). To him that disposeth his way aright; now this cannot be done without a constant supplicating at the throne of grace for more grace. This then {{is the reason why}} every new temptation that comes upon thee, so foils, so overcomes thee, that thou wilt need a new conversion to be recovered from under the power and guilt that cleaves to thee by its overshadowing of thee. <b>A</b> new <b>temptation,</b> <b>a</b> sudden <b>temptation,</b> <b>an</b> unexpected <b>temptation,</b> usually foils those that are not upon their watch; and that have not been before with God to be inlaid with grace proportionable to what may come upon them.|$|R

25|$|When paper bank {{notes were}} first {{introduced}} in England in the 1790s, they {{resulted in a}} dramatic rise in counterfeiting. The attempts by the Bank of England and the Royal Mint to stamp out currency crime led to new policing strategies, including {{the increased use of}} entrapment. The ease with which paper money can be created, by both legitimate authorities and counterfeiters, has led both to <b>a</b> <b>temptation</b> in times of crisis such as war or revolution to produce paper money which was not supported by precious metal or other goods, thus leading to Hyperinflation and a loss of faith in the value of paper money, e.g. the Continental Currency produced by the Continental Congress during the American Revolution, the Assignats produced during the French Revolution, the paper currency produced by the Confederate States of America and the individual states of the Confederate States of America, the financing of World War I by the Central Powers (by 1922 1 gold Austro-Hungarian krone of 1914 was worth 14,400 paper Kronen), the devaluation of the Yugoslav Dinar in the 1990s, etc. Banknotes may also be overprinted to reflect political changes that occur faster than new currency can be printed.|$|E

But, you know, romances in Summer Bay never last." [...] Of breaking Charlie and Angelo up, Welsh said, [...] "The thinking behind that was to challenge the characters and do something a bit different."

500|$|Several of {{the conspirators}} {{disappeared}} into the night, but Rookwood, Catesby, the Wright brothers, Percy and Grant stayed on. [...] They didn't have long to wait; by 11:00 am {{the next day the}} house was surrounded by 200 of the Sheriff of Worcester's men. [...] In the ensuing battle, Wintour was shot in the shoulder. [...] John and Christopher Wright were each killed. [...] Catesby and Percy were reportedly both killed by a single musket ball. [...] Rookwood was also shot, but survived and was quickly captured. [...] His belongings should by right have been seized by the government, but his elaborate sword apparently proved to be too great <b>a</b> <b>temptation</b> for the Sheriff's men, and disappeared without trace. [...] Rookwood and the others were taken first to Worcester, and then to the Tower of London. [...] Those conspirators still at large were rounded up shortly after.|$|E
500|$|In general, [...] "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] {{received}} a positive critical reaction. British magazine NME, reviewing the UK 7" [...] single in March 1989, said: [...] "All the smart bastards are mixing strings with grunge guitars nowadays and the Pixies are no exception. Snarled vocals, sci-fi lyrics, {{and the usual}} molten lava flow of guitars burn another crater where your ears used to be. 'Monkey Gone to Heaven' pukes acid and poetry into America's AOR heartland before being splattered by the faster and more direct sting of the second track 'Manta Ray'." [...] Upon the release of Doolittle in April 1989, NMEs Edwin Pouncey added: [...] "the wonderful 'Monkey Gone to Heaven' is laced with lush but unobtrusive strings which nibble round {{the edge of the}} song and push it into a new realm of arrangement for the band. The opportunity to give 'Monkey' the full Philharmonic treatment, complete with heavenly harp, must have been <b>a</b> <b>temptation</b> to them. Wisely such a folly has been resisted." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} 252 {{participants}} have competed in Big Brother and in Big Brother: Over The Top, and 27 {{of them have}} competed in multiple seasons: [...] featured 14 returning HouseGuests chosen either through viewer vote or by producers from an initial group of 20 candidates.

Season 13 featured three [...] "Dynamic Duos" [...] from previous seasons, season 14 brought in four Big Brother veterans to coach the 12 new HouseGuests and [...] season 18 saw the return of four returnees playing the game with 12 new houseguests. In , ex-HouseGuests Jason Roy and Jozea Flores were given the chance to return through a public vote. Roy won the public vote and became the 13th houseguest. The 19th season brought along the return of a past houseguest as the 17th houseguest, but he was actually there to take the spot of one of the 16 new houseguests, as a consequence for one of the newbies taking <b>a</b> <b>temptation.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Rick and Laura Brown, two sculptors from Massachusetts, {{along with}} Massachusetts College of Art and Design {{students}} and faculty, constructed another replica. The Browns {{set out to}} gain a better understanding of human ingenuity while keeping Bushnell’s design, materials, and technique authentic. “With it, Yankee ingenuity was born,” observed Rick Brown, referring to the latest in a long line of commemoration that perceived the Turtle as something authentically American. Of the temptation to use synthetic and ahistorical materials, Rob Duarte, a MassArts student observed, “It was always <b>a</b> <b>temptation</b> to use silicone to seal the thing," [...] says Rob Duarte, a MassArt student. [...] "Then you realized that someone else had to figure this out with the same limited resources that we were using. That's just an interesting way to learn. You can't do it any other way than by actually doing it.” The outer shell of the replica was hallowed, using controlled fire, from a twelve-foot Sitka Spruce. The log was seven feet in diameter and shipped from British Columbia. This replica took twelve days to build and was successfully submerged in water. In 2003, it was tested in an indoor test tank at the United States Naval Academy. Lew Nuckols, a professor of Ocean Engineering at USNA, made ten dives, noting “you feel very isolated from the outside world. If you had any sense of claustrophobia it would not be a very good experience.” ...|$|E

[...] Thomas asked {{them what they}} intended to do – [...] "We mean here to die". [...] Thomas replied [...] "I will take such part as you do". [...] Richard Walsh, Sheriff of Worcester, arrived with a vigilante force of about 200men early on 8 November. [...] Thomas {{was the first to}} be hit, in the shoulder, while crossing the courtyard. [...] The Wright brothers were next, followed by Rookwood, still injured from the explosion the night before. [...] Catesby and Percy were dropped by a single lucky shot. [...] The sheriff's men then proceeded to strip the defenders of their valuables, but Thomas was saved by the sheriff's assistant. [...] His fine sword, ordered and paid for four months previously, apparently proved too great <b>a</b> <b>temptation</b> for the Sheriff's men, as it was never seen again. [...] He and the others were taken first to Worcester, and then to the Tower of London. [...] Despite a proclamation of 18 November naming them as wanted men, Robert Wintour and Stephen Litteton managed to evade capture until 9 January 1606. [...] They spent about two months hiding out in barns and houses; at one point they were forced to restrain a drunken poacher who happened upon their hiding place. [...] They were eventually discovered at the house of Humphrey Littleton in Hagley, after a cook, John Finwood, informed on them. [...] Humphrey managed to escape, but was captured at Prestwood, in Staffordshire.|$|E
