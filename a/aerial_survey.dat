5|$|In 1920, he was {{employed}} by the Ordnance Survey. In this position he toured Britain to plot the location of archaeological sites in the landscape, in the process identifying several previously unknown sites. Increasingly interested in aerial archaeology, he obtained aerial photographs produced by the Royal Air Force and identified {{the extent of the}} Stonehenge Avenue, excavating it in 1923. With the archaeologist Alexander Keiller, he conducted an <b>aerial</b> <b>survey</b> of many counties in southern England and raised the finances to secure the land around Stonehenge for The National Trust. In 1927, he established the scholarly journal Antiquity, which contained contributions from many of Britain's most prominent archaeologists, and in 1939 he {{served as president of the}} Prehistoric Society. An internationalist and socialist, he came under the influence of Marxism and for a time became a Soviet sympathiser. During the Second World War he worked with the National Buildings Record, photographically documenting Southampton. After retiring in 1946, he refocused his attention on Sudanese archaeology and wrote several further books prior to his death.|$|E
5|$|Using RAF aerial photographs, Crawford {{determined}} {{the length of}} the Avenue at Stonehenge before embarking on an excavation of the site with A. D. Passmore in late 1923. This project attracted press attention, resulting in Crawford being contacted by the marmalade magnate and archaeologist Alexander Keiller. Keiller invited Crawford to join him in an <b>aerial</b> <b>survey,</b> financed by Keiller himself, in which they flew over Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, Somerset, and Wiltshire in 1924, taking photographs of archaeological traces in the landscape. Many of these images were published in Crawford and Keiller's Wessex from the Air in 1928. In 1927 Crawford and Keiller helped raise the finances to buy the land around Stonehenge and present it to The National Trust to prevent it from being damaged by further agricultural or urban development. Previously, in 1923, Crawford had assisted Keiller in campaigning to prevent a radio mast being erected on the archaeologically significant Windmill Hill in Wiltshire, with Keiller later purchasing the hill and the surrounding Avebury area. Despite this working relationship, the two never became friends, perhaps a result of their highly divergent opinions and interests outside of archaeology.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aerial</b> <b>survey</b> is {{the most}} common method of {{monitoring}} giraffe population trends in the vast roadless tracts of African landscapes, but aerial methods are known to undercount giraffes. Ground-based survey methods are more accurate and should be used in conjunction with aerial surveys to make accurate estimates of population sizes and trends. In 2010, giraffes were assessed as Least Concern from a conservation perspective by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but the 2016 assessment categorized giraffes as Vulnerable. Giraffes have been extirpated from much of their historic range including Eritrea, Guinea, Mauritania and Senegal. They may also have disappeared from Angola, Mali, and Nigeria, but have been introduced to Rwanda and Swaziland. Two subspecies, the West African giraffe and the Rothschild giraffe, have been classified as Endangered, as wild populations of each of them number in the hundreds. In 1997, Jonathan Kingdon suggested that the Nubian giraffe was the most threatened of all giraffes; , it may number fewer than 250, although this estimate is uncertain. Private game reserves have contributed to the preservation of giraffe populations in southern Africa. Giraffe Manor is a popular hotel in Nairobi that also serves as sanctuary for Rothschild's giraffes. The giraffe is a protected species in most of its range. It is the national animal of Tanzania, and is protected by law. Unauthorised killing can result in imprisonment. In 1999, it was estimated that over 140,000 giraffes existed in the wild, estimations as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild, down from 155,000 in 1985, with around 1,144 in captivity.|$|E

50|$|Fairchild {{wanted to}} expand the {{capabilities}} of his cameras for map making and <b>aerial</b> <b>surveying.</b> In 1921, he formed Fairchild <b>Aerial</b> <b>Surveys</b> and bought a surplus World War I Fokker D.VII biplane to take his aerial photographs. Shortly afterward, Fairchild landed a contract to make a photomap of Newark, New Jersey, {{which would be the}} first aerial mapping of a major city. In 1923, Fairchild formed Fairchild <b>Aerial</b> <b>Surveys</b> of Canada, Limited after he was asked by the chief forester of the Laurentide Paper Company to perform <b>aerial</b> <b>surveys</b> of Canada. Back in the United States he made an aerial map of Manhattan Island which {{went on to become a}} commercial success and was implemented by several New York businesses. Other cities began using aerial mapping, as they found it was faster and less expensive than the ground surveys of the time. Aerial photography proved to be a successful commercial venture. To accommodate this growing commercial demand for aerial surveys; Fairchild established Fairchild <b>Aerial</b> <b>Surveys</b> in the United States. In 1965 Fairchild sold Fairchild <b>Aerial</b> <b>Surveys</b> to Aero Services, Inc., which decided to keep only the more recent photographs and dispose of the others. A former Fairchild employee learned of this plan and was able to get the older material to three Southern California Institutions; Whittier College, UCLA, and California State University at Northridge, where he knew professors who would put the material to good use. Whittier College closed access to the photographs in 2010. In 2012, the collection was put up for sale. The University of California Santa Barbara acquired the collection in December, 2012.|$|R

5|$|In 1964, No.82 Wing's Canberras were {{slated for}} {{possible}} bombing and reconnaissance tasks against Indonesian forces under Operation Handover, a little-publicised contingency plan {{put into effect}} during the Indonesia–Malaysia Konfrontasi, although no combat ensued. No.2 Squadron Canberras saw extensive action in the Vietnam War from 1967 to 1971, {{under the control of}} the USAF's 35th Tactical Fighter Wing. The Canberras flew almost 12,000 sorties and delivered over 76,000 pounds of bombs, for the loss of two aircraft to enemy action, and gained a high reputation for their accuracy. No.1OCU was made independent of No.82 Wing in April 1968; its sole purpose from then until its disbandment in June 1971 was to supply trained crews to No.2 Squadron in Vietnam. Nos.1 and 6 Squadrons effectively ceased operations in 1968, while their crews underwent conversion to the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber, which was expected to enter service soon afterwards. Between 1970 and 1973, as an interim measure pending the delayed delivery of the F-111, Nos.1 and 6 Squadrons flew leased F-4E Phantoms; meanwhile No.2 Squadron continued to operate the Canberra, mainly for <b>aerial</b> <b>survey</b> work in Australia and Indonesia, until disbanding in 1982. The Air Force retained the option to purchase the Phantoms if the F-111C program was cancelled. Though not as sophisticated an aircraft as the F-111, the Phantom was a significant advance over the Canberra, and was highly regarded by its RAAF crews.|$|E

Elsewhere on Negros, 30percent of the island's vital sugar crop was destroyed. On the east coast of Leyte, the typhoon was considered the worst in living memory, and ninety percent of homes there were destroyed. In Negros Oriental, schoolhouses in Canlaon, Vallehermoso, Negros Oriental, and Guihulngan were blown down. An <b>aerial</b> <b>survey</b> mission estimated that at least of coconut plantations were devastated; other coconut plantations throughout the Philippines also suffered considerable damage. Copra crops also suffered sizeable losses, though production was expected to remain at forecast levels. Tacloban's San Jose Airfield was severely damaged by the strong storm surge from Amy. In the Tacloban and Surigao Strait area, an estimated 146people were killed. In the Leytenian town of Abuyog, the mayor had announced that 176people were killed in the town alone. Another 135fatalities were confirmed in Sogod. More than 100persons were injured by falling coconuts and other airborne debris. On Leyte alone, damage was estimated at $8million.

5|$|The {{origin of}} the Namib Desert Horse is unclear, though several {{theories}} have been put forward. Genetic tests have been performed, although none to date have completely verified their origin. The most likely ancestors of the horses are a mix of riding horses and cavalry horses, many from German breeding programs, released from various farms and camps in the early 20th century, especially during World War I. Whatever their origin, the horses eventually congregated in the Garub Plains, near Aus, Namibia, {{the location of a}} man-made water source. They were generally ignored by humans, except for the periodic threat of eradication due to the possibility that they were destroying native herbivore habitat, until the 1980s. In 1984, the first <b>aerial</b> <b>survey</b> of the population was made, and in 1986, their traditional grazing land was incorporated into the Namib-Naukluft Park. At several points, some horses have been removed from the herd, including the removal and sale of over one-third of the population in 1992. Since the early 1990s, close records of the population have been kept, and studies have been performed to determine the horses' effect on their environment. Despite being considered an exotic species within the park, they are allowed to remain due to their ties to the country's history and draw as a tourist attraction.|$|E

Stranding and museum specimen records indicate that Irrawaddy dolphins occur only in the northern half of Australia, from approximately the Brisbane River (27 ° 32 'S, 152 ° 49 'E) {{on the east coast}} to Broome (17 ° 57 'S, 122 ° 14 'E) on the west coast. <b>Aerial</b> <b>surveys</b> demonstrate that Irrawaddy dolphins occur mainly in protected, shallow, coastal waters, close to river and creek mouths, which appear to be an important habitat for the species. Irrawaddy dolphins tend to form relatively small groups of 1 - 10 animals with occasional aggregations of up to 14 animals. The status of Irrawaddy dolphins in Australian waters is difficult to assess, because most data have been collected opportunistically. However, the low number of sightings during <b>aerial</b> <b>surveys,</b> in comparison with observations of other sympatric marine mammals, such as Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis), suggest that Irrawaddy dolphins are relatively uncommon in Australian waters. or possibly are inadequately sampled on <b>aerial</b> <b>surveys...</b>|$|R
