50|$|Early second {{generation}} cephalosporins {{are very similar}} in basic structure to the first generation. Loracarbef however {{does not have the}} normal dihydrothiazin ring but is a carbacephem that has a carbon atom in the ring instead of a sulfur atom making it a tetrahydropyridine ring. This chemical property gives Loracarbef better stability in plasma while retaining oral absorption characteristics and affinity for binding to PBP. The 7-phenyl-glycine makes it orally available and the chlorine at position C-3 makes it as active as Cefaclor. An important structural change in the development of {{second generation}} cephalosporins was the introduction of an α-iminomethoxy group to the C-7 side chain. This gave an increased resistance to β-lactamases due to stereochemical blocking of the beta-lactam ring. Cefuroxime was the first cephalosporin to incorporate this side chain. Another very important group in the second generation is the <b>aminothiazole</b> ring to the C-3 side chain. This development drastically increased binding affinity to PBP and increased antimicrobial activity. The <b>aminothiazole</b> ring {{can be seen in the}} structure of Cefotiam.|$|E

50|$|Acylation of {{the primary}} amine 1 with 4-bromo-3-oxobutanoyl bromide (2) leads to the amide (3).

The bromoketone array in that intermediate constitutes a classical starting function for construction of thiazoles. Reaction of 4 with thiourea thus leads to formation of an <b>aminothiazole</b> moiety. Thus there is obtained the antibiotic cefdinir (5).|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of third generation cephalosporins have the <b>aminothiazole</b> group at position C-7.

This group gives ceftibuten higher resistance to enhanced spectrum β-lactamases. Many of the oral third generation cephalosporins are esters of parenteral forms and are hydrolysed by esterases in the digestive tract (Cefteram-pivoxil). Some of the third generation drugs can be absorbed orally without the need of esterification. This is for example done with Cefixime and Cefdinir by putting a vinyl group in the C-3 position.|$|E

40|$|The bioisosteric {{replacement}} of the guanidino group in arpromidine-like histamine H 2 receptor (H 2 R) agonists by an acylguanidine moiety is a useful approach to obtain potent H 2 R agonists with improved oral bioavailability and penetration across the blood brain barrier. Unfortunately, the selectivity of such N(G) -acylated imidazolylpropyl-guanidines for the H 2 R is poor, in particular versus histamine H 3 (H 3 R) and H 4 receptors (H 4 R). This drawback appears {{to depend on the}} "privileged" imidazolylpropylguanidine structure. The 2 -amino- 4 -methylthiazol- 5 -yl moiety is a bioisostere of the imidazole ring in the moderately potent H 2 R selective histamine analogue amthamine. This approach was successfully applied to acylguanidine-type H 2 R agonists. The <b>aminothiazoles</b> are nearly equipotent with the corresponding imidazoles as H 2 R agonists.

Docking studies on H 2 R models support the hypothesis that 2 -aminothiazolyl and imidazolyl derivatives interact with H 2 Rs as bioisosteres. In contrast to the imidazoles, the <b>aminothiazoles</b> are devoid of agonistic or relevant antagonistic effects on H 1, H 3 and H 4 receptors.

40|$|Fibrosis {{is caused}} by scar tissue {{formation}} in internal organs and is associated with 45 % of deaths in the U. S. Pentraxins are a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins that have profound effects of the innate immune system and regulate the development of fibrosis. The pentraxin Serum Amyloid P (SAP) alleviates fibrosis in mice and two human clinical trials, whereas C-reactive protein (CRP) which resembles SAP exacerbates fibrosis. Surprisingly, these two pentraxins bind the same Fc? receptors (Fc?R) with similar affinities but have opposite effects. In this dissertation, I elucidate the role of Fc?R in the regulation of the innate immune system by pentraxins. I find that although Fc?R {{play a role in}} the regulation of immune cells by SAP, they are not necessary for SAP effects. SAP mainly uses the C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN to alter immune responses and through its interaction with DC-SIGN SAP differentiates itself from CRP.

The compounds were investigated for H 2 R agonism in GTPase and [35 S]GTPγS binding assays at guinea pig (gp) and human (h) H 2 R-GsαS fusion proteins including various H 2 R mutants, at the isolated gp right atrium, and in GTPase assays for activity on recombinant H 1, H 3 and H 4 receptors.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} evidence that histamine receptor stimulation might be an interesting aspect {{for the development of}} future drugs as well. Arpromidine and related imidazolylpropylguanidines are the most potent H 2 R agonists on the isolated guinea pig right atrium. The strongly basic guanidino group is essential for the agonistic activity but it is also responsible for very low oral bioavailability, non-H 2 R-mediated effects and lack of penetration across the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, the objective of this work was to design, synthesize and characterize histamine H 2 receptor agonists, structurally related to arpromidine, but with lower basicity in order to achieve more favourable pharmacokinetic properties, in particular, oral bioavailability and penetration across the blood-brain barrier. The first part of this project was to develop a general synthetic route for the synthesis of NG-acylated imidazolylpropylguanidines. In Chapter 3, the development of a very convenient and straight forward synthetic route is described for the synthesis of NG-acylated guanidines, from the commercially available starting material, urocanic acid and guanidine, followed by coupling of acids. Then the synthesised compounds were pharmacologically tested on isolated guinea pig tissues (ileum: H 1 R, H 3 R; right atrium: H 2 R), on human H 1 R expressing cells (U 373 MG) and on membrane preparations of guinea pig and human histamine H 2 or H 4 receptor expressing Sf 9 cells. The basicity of the acylguanidines is by 4 - 5 orders of magnitude lower than that of the corresponding guanidines. Acyl and alkyl guanidines are about equipotent as, for instance, demonstrated for the diphenylpropyl versus the diphenylpropanoyl and for impromidine versus the oxo-substituted analogue. Surprisingly, compounds with only one phenyl ring are equally or even more potent than the diaryl analogues. On the isolated guinea pig right atrium the most active H 2 R agonist, the 3 -phenylbutanoyl substituted guanidine was about 30 times more potent than the natural ligand. However, the acylated imidazolylpropylguanidines are superior with respect to pharmacokinetic properties. A very important finding is that the compounds are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are capable of penetrating through the blood-brain barrier. Centrally active H 2 R agonists will be useful pharmacological tools to study the role histamine H 2 receptors in the brain. In Chapter 4, the bioisosteric replacement of the imidazolyl moiety in NG-acylated guanidine-type histamine H 2 receptor agonists by a 2 -amino- 4 -methylthiazol- 5 -yl group resulted in about the same H 2 R agonistic potency on the isolated guinea pig right atrium as well as in GTPase assays. Interestingly, in the GTPase assay on the human H 2 R the thiazolyl analogue with cyclohexylbutanoyl substituent was favoured compared to the corresponding phenylbutanoylguanidine. This may be interpreted a hint that a certain degree of selectivity for the human H 2 R may be achieved by structural variation of both the acyl and the heterocyclylpropyl group. Moreover, the <b>aminothiazoles</b> proved to be devoid of H 3 R antagonistic activity. Thus, the selectivity for H 2 R versus H 3 R can be considerably improved. In Chapter 5, the stereoselective preparation of enantiomers of several chiral new H 2 R agonists is described. The building block (R and S) - 3 -phenylbutanoic acid was synthesized from the achiral precursor, methyl (E) -but- 2 -enoate, via asymmetric conjugate addition of phenylboronic acid by using a catalytic amount of rhodium catalyst and chiral binap ligand, followed by hydrolysis of the methyl ester.

40|$|Figuratively, drug {{metabolism}} {{can be considered}} as {{two sides of the same}} coin; one leading to desired, beneficial effects, e. g. by activation of prodrugs, whereas the other one results in adverse side effects due to toxic metabolites. In this work both aspects were explored. Transdermal therapeutic systems (TTS) are known as drug formulations providing constant and sustained drug plasma levels at reduced application frequency. Therefore, TTS are particularly advantageous for the treatment of disorders requiring long-term pharmacotherapy as, e. g., cardiovascular diseases. By now, hypertension is recognized as one of the leading risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, there is a strong discrepancy between the high incidence of hypertension and the availability of transdermally applicable antihypertensive drugs. Thus, one part of this thesis aimed at novel derivatives of the angiotensin II AT 1 receptor antagonist candesartan and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril, suitable for administration via a TTS. The prodrug approach was pursued to design and synthesize various ester-based candesartan and cilazapril prodrugs with physicochemical properties considered suitable to overcome the barrier function of the skin. The novel compounds were bioanalytically characterized with respect to solid-state stability, susceptibility for enzymatic hydrolysis, and stability against non-enzymatic hydrolysis. All candesartan and cilazapril prodrugs except for a simple ethyl ester of cilazapril were enzymatically hydrolyzed to release the active principle. Additionally, the potential candesartan prodrugs turned out to be potent angiotensin II AT 1 receptor antagonists (Kb = 0. 8 – 6. 4 nM) in a fura- 2 calcium-assay on rat glomerular mesangial cells. The three most promising candidates of each group were selected for TTS development, namely candesartan 1 -(isopropyloxycarbonyloxy) ethyl ester, candesartan 1 -(2, 2 -dimethylpropanoyloxy) ethyl ester and candesartan morpholinoethyl ester as well as cilazapril 1 -(ethoxycarbonyloxy) ethyl ester, cilazapril 1 -(cyclohexyloxycarbonyloxy) ethyl ester and cilazapril morpholinoethyl ester. These new chemical entities were found to be com¬pa¬rable or even superior to the reference compounds candesartan cilexetil and cilazapril, respectively, in terms of formulate-ability, TTS quality and stability in a silicone PSA matrix. Furthermore, the manufactured TTS containing the new prodrugs were superior to the respective candesartan cilexetil and cilazapril formulations, when investigated for trans¬dermal permeation through animal and human skin using Franz diffusion cells. The second part of this thesis addressed the adverse side of {{drug metabolism}}, namely toxic effects due to the formation of reactive metabolites/intermediates capable of cova¬lent protein binding. In our workgroup highly potent N(G) -acylated hetarylpropylguanidine-type H 2 R agonists, comprising either an imidazole ring or a 2 -aminothiazole group, were developed, which could serve as valuable pharmacological tools for in vitro and potential in vivo studies. There is strong evidence that cytochrome P 450 -mediated bioactivation of the 2 -aminothiazole ring results in highly reactive intermediates. Thus, the aim of this project was the detection and identification of reactive intermediates by co-incubating N(G) -acylated 3 -(2 -aminothiazol- 5 -yl) propylguanidines with rat liver microsomes and glutathione (GSH) to trap putative reactive molecules. By means of liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and appropriate MS/MS experiments such as constant neutral loss scanning, multiple reaction monitoring and product ion scanning, GSH adducts of reactive intermediates of N(G) -acylated 3 -(2 -aminothiazol- 5 -yl) propylguanidines were detected. Benefitting from the selectivity of fluorescence detection, these results were corroborated by using dansylated GSH as a trapping agent. Interestingly, blocking of the 4 -position of the 2 -aminothiazole by methyl substitution seemed to prevent bioactivation of the heterocycle. Finally, unspecific toxicity of N(G) -acylated hetarylpropylguanidines was investigated, revealing considerable hemolysis and cytotoxicity in the micromolar range, particularly when the acyl part of the compounds contained highly lipophilic moieties. In summary, the ambivalent character of drug metabolism was highlighted in this thesis. Novel synthesized prodrugs of cilazapril and candesartan turned out to be enzymatically convertible to the active drug and to be superior to the reference drugs in terms of stability, formulate-ability and skin permeability, thus representing promising compounds for transdermal antihypertensive therapy via TTS. By contrast, the identification of reactive intermediates of N(G) -acylated hetarylpropylguanidines demonstrated that one should be aware of the potential risk of bioactivation residing in structural moieties such as <b>aminothiazoles</b> to avoid toxification...|$|R

40|$|Previously, our {{workgroup}} {{applied the}} bivalent ligand approach for the H 2 R by linking two acylguanidine moieties. This led to highly potent and selective H 2 R agonists. However, the acylguandines {{turned out to}} decompose upon long-term storage in aqueous solution, in particular under alkaline conditions. Based on this preceding work, the medicinal chemistry part of this thesis deals with the synthesis of stable bivalent H 2 R agonists in which the acylguanidine group {{was replaced by a}} bioisosteric carbamoylguanidine moiety. With respect to studying the mode and stoichiometry of binding of such bivalent compounds, the synthesis of a chain-branched dimeric ligand, enabling radio- and fluorescence labeling was considered. The prepared compounds were investigated in GTPγS binding assays on recombinant human and guinea pig H 2 R and by radioligand competition binding on human H 1, H 2, H 3 and H 4 receptors expressed in Sf 9 insect cells. Moreover, representative compounds were studied on human monocytes, with regard to cAMP formation and the inhibition of fMLP induced reactive oxygen species. The bivalent carbamoylguanidine-type H 2 R ligands proved to be high affinity H 2 R agonists, equipotent with the corresponding carba analogs, the acylguanidines. Achieving up to 2500 times the potency of histamine, these compounds are among the most potent H 2 R agonists known so far. Unlike the imidazole-type compounds, the bioisosteric <b>aminothiazoles</b> proved to be selective for the H 2 R over the other histamine receptor subtypes. Although the “cold” version of a synthesized propionamide derivative proved to be a potent and selective H 2 R agonist, the corresponding tritiated analog, due to a high degree of unspecific binding, was not applicable to saturation binding studies, making the determination of the number of binding sites impossible. Unfortunately, the fluorescently labeled ligands entered the cells in an H 2 R-independent manner. In human monocytes the investigated compounds induced cAMP accumulation and inhibited the fMLP-induced ROS production in a highly potent manner so that such compounds represent a good starting point for the development of selective H 2 R drugs for the treatment of AML. The bioisosteric and bivalent approach led to highly potent, selective and stable H 2 R agonists that proved to be useful pharmacological tools for functional studies on recombinant receptors and native cells. Regarding the bioanalytical and toxicological properties of the bivalent ligands, compounds bearing a short spacer should be preferred for future in-vivo studies. The second part of this work aimed at the establishment of cell-based functional assays for the discrimination between alternative signaling pathways activated by HxR stimulation. For this purpose, HEK 293 T CRE Luc cells were stably transfected with the cDNA encoding the hH 1 R or the hH 2 R, respectively. The transfectants were investigated in a luciferase reporter gene assay, in a fura- 2 assay and in an aequorin assay. Moreover, a TR-FRET based cAMP assay was applied. The activation of the H 1 R led to an increase in the transcription of luciferase. In the presence of the selective Gαq inhibitor UBO-QIC the luciferase expression was reduced, whereas in combination with UBO-QIC and PKA inhibitors (Rp-cAMP-S or Rp- 8 -Br-cAMP-S) the luciferase activity was almost completely inhibited. The data obtained from the luciferase reporter gene assay suggested that the luciferase expression, mediated by the H 1 R, was at least in part mediated by cAMP. Furthermore, it was shown that cells preincubated with UBO-QIC were no longer capable of triggering a Ca 2 + signal in the aequorin assay, upon activation of the H 1 R. Detection of a cAMP signal failed most probably due to a low signal-to-noise ratio, hence it should be taken into consideration that the activation of the hH 1 R is associated with additional pathways. The H 2 R revealed high constitutive activity in the luciferase reporter gene assay, probably due to a high expression level of the receptor in the cells. In the presence of UBO-QIC the luciferase activity was reduced. Additionally, it was shown in both Ca 2 + assays that the activation of the H 2 R led to a Gαq mediated Ca 2 + response. The data indicate that, regardless of preferential coupling of hH 1 R and hH 2 R to Gαq and Gαs, respectively, both receptors are capable of triggering differential signaling pathways, at least in genetically modified cells. In general, the stably co-transfected HEK 293 T CRE Luc cells represent a powerful pharmacological toolkit for: -	The identification of alternative signaling pathways. -	The investigation of GPCRs and the pharmacological characterization of functionally selective ligands. -	The deconvolution of signals from label-free assays...|$|R
40|$|Potent and {{selective}} histamine H 2 receptor (H 2 R) agonists, including brain-penetrating compounds, are required as pharmacological tools {{to evaluate the}} (patho) physiological role of H 2 Rs. Moreover, H 2 R agonists might be of therapeutic value as drugs, for example, {{in the treatment of}} acute myelogenous leukemia. Previously, acylguanidine-type H 2 R agonists with reduced basicity were synthesized in our laboratory, resulting in improved bioavailability and CNS penetration compared to the corresponding guanidines. Based on the preceding work, this thesis aimed at the design, the synthesis and the pharmacological characterization of novel NG-acylated hetarylpropylguanidines to elaborate the structure-activity relationships (SAR) in more detail. A central aspect of this project was the development of bivalent acylguanidine-type H 2 R agonists. The prepared compounds were investigated for H 2 R agonism in GTPase and [35 S]GTPγS binding assays at guinea pig (gp) and human (h) H 2 R-GsαS fusion proteins including various H 2 R mutants, at the isolated gp right atrium (in cooperation with Prof. Elz, University of Regensburg), and, with respect to H 2 R selectivity, in GTPase assays for activity on recombinant human H 1, H 3 and H 4 receptors. In addition, representative compounds were investigated regarding their hemolytic and cytotoxic properties as well as their potential to bind to plasma proteins. NG-Acylated 3 -(2 -aminothiazol- 5 -yl) propylguanidines proved to be H 2 R partial to full agonists. Within this series, highest potencies resided in compounds having a two- or three-membered carbon chain between carbonyl group and phenyl or cyclohexyl ring, respectively. Notably, the introduction of a free amino group at an appropriate distance to the pharmacophoric moiety was beneficial with respect to H 2 R agonistic potency. In contrast to their imidazole analogs, the <b>aminothiazoles</b> were highly selective for the H 2 R vs. other HR subtypes. Thus, this study substantiates previous results, confirming that the 2 -aminothiazole and the imidazole moiety are bioisosteric groups at the H 2 R but not at the H 3 R and H 4 R. Moreover, in contrast to amthamine, the 4 -methyl group at the thiazole ring did not significantly contribute to the H 2 R agonism of NG-acylated 3 -(2 -amino- 4 -methylthiazol- 5 -yl) propylguanidines. Bivalent H 2 R agonists were synthesized by connecting the guanidine groups of two molecules by NG-acylation with dicarboxylic acids of different structure and length (spacer lengths ≈ 6 – 27 Å). The bivalent ligands proved to be up to two orders of magnitude more potent than monovalent acylguanidines and up to 4000 times more potent than histamine at the gpH 2 R (compounds with octanedioyl to decanedioyl spacers). These are the most potent histamine H 2 R agonists known to date. However, due to insufficient spacer lengths of the most active compounds, the tremendous gain in potency compared to monovalent analogs cannot be explained by simultaneous occupation of the orthosteric recognition sites of a H 2 R dimer. The high potency rather results from interaction with an accessory (allosteric?) binding site at the same receptor protomer. Replacing the second hetarylpropylguanidine moiety with simple alkyl guanidine groups afforded rather high H 2 R agonistic activities (EC 50 values in the low nanomolar range), whereas all other variations {{in this part of the}} molecule led to drastically decreased potencies. A further decrease in potency resulted from the elimination of the second guanidino group, corroborating the importance of a basic centre at an appropriate distance to the pharmacophore to obtain highly potent bivalent H 2 R agonists. These results are consistent with the concept of interaction with the orthosteric and an accessory binding site of one H 2 R protomer, i. e. the accessory binding site can accommodate the second acylguanidine portion. All investigated compounds were significantly more potent and efficacious at the gpH 2 R relative to the hH 2 R. These differences might help to verify the suggested model of bivalent ligand - receptor interactions via identification of species-dependent molecular determinants of the orthosteric and the accessory binding site in hH 2 R and gpH 2 R, respectively. Investigations on gpH 2 R and hH 2 R mutants/chimera confirmed the key role of non-conserved Tyr- 17 and Asp- 271 in TM 1 and TM 7 in the gpH 2 R for species-selective H 2 R activation and suggested that the e 2 loop does not participate in direct ligand - receptor interaction. To explore the topology of this putative accessory binding site in more detail, further studies on H 2 R mutants are necessary. In conclusion, bioisosteric and bivalent approaches applied in this thesis led to highly potent {{and selective}} pharmacological tools for more detailed investigations of the H 2 R. However, in view of cell based in vitro investigations or future in vivo experiments, the drug-like properties of these H 2 R agonists should be further improved. ...|$|R
