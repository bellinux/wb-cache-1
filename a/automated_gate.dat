Experts developed five standardized, eight-color panels for identification of major immune cell subsets in peripheral blood. These were produced as pre-configured, lyophilized, reagents in 96 -well plates. We present {{the results of a}} coordinated analysis of samples across nine laboratories using these panels with standardized operating procedures (SOPs). Manual gating was performed by each site and by a central site. <b>Automated</b> <b>gating</b> algorithms were developed and tested by the FlowCAP consortium. Centralized manual gating can reduce cross-center variability, and we sought to determine whether automated methods could streamline and standardize the analysis. Within-site variability was low in all experiments, but cross-site variability was lower when central analysis was performed in comparison with site-specific analysis. It was also lower for clearly defined cell subsets than those based on dim markers and for rare populations. <b>Automated</b> <b>gating</b> was able to match the performance of central manual analysis for all tested panels, exhibiting little to no bias and comparable variability. Standardized staining, data collection, and <b>automated</b> <b>gating</b> can increase power, reduce variability, and streamline analysis for immunophenotyping...|$|R

40|$|Context. Due to {{increase}} in demand for RORO shipping services,the RORO terminal gate system need to handle more number of vehicles for every RORO vessel departure. Therefore, various congestion problems can occur; so, to address all possible congestion related problemsat RORO terminal, terminal gate systems are implemented with advanced technologies and updated to full or partial functioning <b>automated</b> <b>gate</b> systems. Objectives. In this research study considering the future increase in demand for wheeled cargo shipping, we attempt to propose a solution for reducing congestion and investigating optimal positions for each <b>automated</b> <b>gate</b> system service at RORO port terminal. Methods. In this Master thesis, as part of qualitative study we conduct a literature review and case study {{to know about the}} existing related work on this research problem and know about the real world system operation and behaviour of a RORO terminal gate system. Later, applying the adequate knowledge acquired from above mentioned qualitative studies, we perform a discrete event simulation experiment using Anylogic® professional 7. 02 simulation software to address defined research objectives. Results. Considering the peak and low periods of present and future estimated demand volumes as different scenarios,various simulation experiment results are generated for different key performance indicators. The result values of these key performance indicators address various research objectives. Conclusions. This research study finally concludes that, the average queue length values at each <b>automated</b> <b>gate</b> system service implicates optimal position for each service and directly address the congestion problem. We also conclude that in every estimated increase in vehicles attending the RORO terminal, assigning optimal arrival time windows for respective vehicle types minimizes the congestion problem at <b>automated</b> <b>gate</b> system...|$|E

40|$|To {{assure the}} flood {{safety in the}} valley of Lower Savinja River, and above all safety in urban centers like the cities of Celje and Laško, it’s {{necessary}} to assure {{the reduction of the}} peak flow of the Savinja river. In spite of flooding in the middle stream and on all tributaries downstream, the conductivity of Savinja river in urban centers is smaller than high water levels with return period of 50 years. With direct approaches to affected urban areas it’s not possible to assure enough flood safety. The only possible solution is to retain high waters on middle stream. A numerical hydraulic model of the Savinja river, of the reach from Dobrteša vas village to the confluence with the stream Bolska, was elaborated using HEC – RAS program. The hydraulic calculations were made for mixed flow regime using steady and unsteady flow simulations. Two unsteady flow situations are presented; a catastrophic flood situation, which happened on November 1990, and a synthetic hydrograph of a flood with 100 -year recurring interval and duration of 24 hours. The flood retention basin at the village Latkova vas was presented as a flood protection countermeasure. An optimization of the lateral inflow structure is accomplished, to assure the best use of the retention basin. Two types of lateral structures were compared, a passive overflow weir and an <b>automated</b> <b>gate...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To use hourly {{building}} occupancy data {{over the}} period of 2012 - 2014 {{to determine the effect}} of changes to library hours of operation on building occupancy near and in the hours leading up to closing time. Methods: Data were collected using an <b>automated</b> <b>gate</b> count system at the primary entrance to the library. The system tracked the occupancy of the building by comparing the number of entrances and exits hourly each day. Incremental changes to the library’s hours of operation occurred in the same time period for the years 2012 - 2014. This time period will be compared year-to-year. We will test whether changes in closing time {{have a significant effect on}} mean occupancy rates during each of the three hours leading up to closing. Based on a previous study which examined a smaller, six-week period between 2012 - 2014, we expect to find that as closing time is extended, building occupancy in the hours preceding closing time increases despite a decrease in occupancy at closing. Results: Mean occupancy during the hour before closing time did not change when closing time was extended from 9 PM to 10 PM. When closing time was extended to 12 AM, mean occupancy during the hour before closing decreased. Mean occupancy during the hour ending at 9 PM increased when closing time was extended from 9 PM to 10 PM. Mean occupancy during the hour ending at 10 PM increased when closing time was extended from 10 PM to 12 AM. We plan to also include data from the ongoing Spring semester in the final results. Conclusions: Occupancy near closing decreased as closing time became later. While occupancy near closing decreased somewhat, occupancy earlier in the evening increased as library hours were extended. The benefits of increased library occupancy appear to justify sustaining extended operating hours...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{topic of}} freight {{transport}} by rail, {{is a complex}} theme and, in recent years, a main issue of European policy. The legislation evolution and the White Paper 2011 have demonstrated the European intention to re-launch this sector. The challenge is to promote the intermodal transport system {{to the detriment of}} road freight transport. In this context, the intermodal freight terminals play a primary role for the supply chain, they are the connection point between the various transport nodes and the nodal points where the freight are handled, stored and transferred between different modes to final customer. To achieve the purpose, proposed by the EC, are necessary the performances improvement of existing intermodal freight terminals and the development of innovative intermodal freight terminals. Many terminal performances improvement is have been proposed and sometime experimented. They are based both on operational measures (e. g. horizontal and parallel handling, faster and fully direct handling) and on innovative technologies (e. g. automatic system for horizontal and parallel handling, <b>automated</b> <b>gate</b> for data exchange) inside the terminals, with often-contradictory results. The research work described in this paper (developed within the EU project Capacity 4 Rail) focusses on the assessment of effects that these innovations can have in the intermodal freight terminals. The innovative operational measures and technologies have been combined in different scenarios, to be evaluated by a methodological approach including to other an analytical methods and simulation models. The output of this assessment method are key performance indicators (KPI) setup according to terminals typologies the proposals and related to different aspects (e. g. management, operation and organization. In the present work suitable KPIs (e. g. total/partial transit times) for to evaluate have been applied. Finally, in addition to methodological framework illustrated, a real case of study will be illustrated: the intermodal rail-road freight terminal Munich-Riem (Germany) ...|$|E
