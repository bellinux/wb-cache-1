40|$|Global degree/strength based {{preferential}} attachment {{is widely}} used as an evolution mechanism of networks. But {{it is hard to}} believe that any individual can get global information and shape the network architecture based on it. In this paper, it is found that the global preferential attachment emerges from the local interaction models, including distance-dependent preferential attachment (DDPA) evolving model of weighted networks(M. Li et al, New Journal of Physics 8 (2006) 72), <b>acquaintance</b> <b>network</b> model(J. Davidsen et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 88 (2002) 128701) and connecting nearest-neighbor(CNN) model(A. Vazquez, Phys. Rev. E 67 (2003) 056104). For DDPA model and CNN model, the attachment rate depends linearly on the degree or strength, while for <b>acquaintance</b> <b>network</b> model, the dependence follows a sublinear power law. It implies that for the evolution of social networks, local contact could be more fundamental than the presumed global preferential attachment. This is onsistent with the result observed in the evolution of empirical email networks. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} that many social networks, and indeed many networks of other types also, have broad distributions of vertex degree. Here we show that this has a substantial impact on the shape of ego-centered networks, i. e., sets of network vertices that are within a given distance of a specified central vertex, the ego. This in turn affects concepts and methods based on ego-centered networks, such as snowball sampling and the "ripple effect". In particular, we argue that one's acquaintances, one's immediate neighbors in the <b>acquaintance</b> <b>network,</b> are {{far from being a}} random sample of the population, and that this biases the numbers of neighbors two and more steps away. We demonstrate this concept using data drawn from academic collaboration networks, for which, as we show, current simple theories for the typical size of ego-centered networks give numbers that differ greatly from those measured in reality. We present an improved theoretical model which gives significantly better results. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures, 1 tabl...|$|E

40|$|An <b>acquaintance</b> <b>network</b> is {{a social}} {{structure}} {{made up of a}} set of actors and the ties between them. These ties change dynamically as a consequence of incessant interactions between the actors. In this paper we introduce a social network model called the Interaction-Based (IB) model that involves well-known sociological principles. The connections between the actors and the strength of the connections are influenced by the continuous positive and negative interactions between the actors and, vice versa, the future interactions are more likely to happen between the actors that are connected with stronger ties. The model is also inspired by the social behavior of animal species, particularly that of ants in their colony. A model evaluation showed that the IB model turned out to be sparse. The model has a small diameter and an average path length that grows in proportion to the logarithm of the number of vertices. The clustering coefficient is relatively high, and its value stabilizes in larger networks. The degree distributions are slightly right-skewed. In the mature phase of the IB model, i. e., when the number of edges does not change significantly, most of the network properties do not change significantly either. The IB model was found to be the best of all the compared models in simulating the e-mail URV (University Rovira i Virgili of Tarragona) network because the properties of the IB model more closely matched those of the e-mail URV network than the other model...|$|E

This community is a model for several similar efforts, both public and commercial, and even for the knowledge economy of the future e-society. For these reasons, issues of quality, social processes, and motivation within the Wikipedia knowledge community have attracted attention of researchers. Research has often used Social Network Analysis applied to networks created based on behavioral data available from the edit history of the Wikipedia. This paper asks the following question: are the popular assumptions about the social interpretations of networks created from the edit history valid? We verify commonly assumed interpretations of four types of networks created from discussions on Wikipedia talk pages, co-edits and reverts in Wikipedia articles, and edits of articles in various topics, by comparing these networks with results from a survey of editors of the Polish Wikipedia community. The results indicate that while the behavioral networks are strongly related to the declarations of respondents, only in one case of the network created from talk pages and interpreted as acquaintance we can observe a near equivalence. The article next describes improved definitions of behavioral indicators obtained through machine learning. The improved networks are much closer to their declarative counterparts.

The method is an extension of the snowball sample method and can, given that some assumptions are met, generate unbi-ased population estimates. One key assumption, not likely to be met, is that the <b>acquaintance</b> <b>network</b> in which the recruitment process takes place is undirected, meaning that all recruiters should have the potential to be recruited by the person they recruit. Here we investigate the potential bias of directedness by simulating RDS on real and artificial network structures. We show that directedness is likely to generate bias that cannot be compensated for unless the sampled individuals know how many that potentially may have recruited them (i. e. their indegree), which is unlikely in most situations. Based on one known parameter, we propose an estimator for RDS on directed networks when only outdegrees are observed. By comparison of current RDS estimators ’ performances on networks with varying structures, we find that our new estimator, together with a recent estimator, which requires the population size as a known quantity, have relatively low level of estimate error and bias. Based on our new estimator, sensitivity analysis can be made by varying values of the known parameter to take uncertainty of network directedness and error in reporting degrees into account. Finally, we have developed a bootstrap procedure for the new estimator to construct confidence intervals...|$|E
40|$|The "small-world effect" is the {{observation}} that one can find a short chain of acquaintances, often {{of no more than}} a handful of individuals, connecting almost any two people on the planet. It is often expressed in the language of networks, where it is equivalent to the statement that most pairs of individuals are connected by a short path through the <b>acquaintance</b> <b>network.</b> Although the small-world effect is well-established empirically for contemporary social networks, we argue here that it is a relatively recent phenomenon, arising only in the last few hundred years: for most of mankind's tenure on Earth the social world was large, with most pairs of individuals connected by relatively long chains of acquaintances, if at all. Our conclusions are based on observations about the spread of diseases, which travel over contact networks between individuals and whose dynamics can give us clues to the structure of those networks even when direct network measurements are not available. As an example we consider the spread of the Black Death in 14 th-century Europe, which is known to have traveled across the continent in well-defined waves of infection over the course of several years. Using established epidemiological models, we show that such wave-like behavior can occur only if contacts between individuals living far apart are exponentially rare. We further show that if long-distance contacts are exponentially rare, then the shortest chain of contacts between distant individuals is on average a long one. The observation of the wave-like spread of a disease like the Black Death thus implies a network without the small-world effect. Comment: 8 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

Adaptive rewiring of links can happen in real life systems such as <b>acquaintance</b> <b>networks</b> where {{people are more likely to}} maintain a social connection if their views and values are similar. In our study, we consider different variants of a model for consensus formation. Our investigations reveal that the adaptation of the network topology fosters cluster formation by enhancing communication between agents of similar opinion, though it also promotes the division of these clusters. The temporal behavior is also strongly affected by adaptivity: while, on static networks, it is influenced by percolation properties, on adaptive networks, both the early and late time evolution of the system are determined by the rewiring process. The investigation of a variant of the model reveals that the scenarios of transitions between consensus and polarized states are more robust on adaptive networks. Comment: 11 pages, 14 figure...|$|R

The models {{fall into two}} categories: those in which the addition of new links {{is dependent on the}} (typically local) network structure (network evolution models, NEMs), and those in which links are generated based only on nodal attributes (nodal attribute models, NAMs). An exponential random graph model (ERGM) with structural dependencies is included for comparison. We fit models from each of these categories to two empirical <b>acquaintance</b> <b>networks</b> with respect to basic network properties. We compare higher order structures in the resulting networks with those in the data, with the aim of determining which models produce the most realistic network structure with respect to degree distributions, assortativity, clustering spectra, geodesic path distributions, and community structure (subgroups with dense internal connections). We find that the nodal attribute models successfully produce assortative networks and very clear community structure. However, they generate unrealistic clustering spectra and peaked degree distributions that do not match empirical data on large social networks. On the other hand, many of the network evolution models produce degree distributions and clustering spectra that agree more closely with data. They also generate assortative networks and community structure, although often not to the same extent as in the data. The ERG model turns out to produce the weakest community structure...|$|R

The model captures essential properties of the structure and growth dynamics of social <b>networks,</b> <b>acquaintance</b> <b>networks</b> and scientific citation networks, where duplication mechanisms play a major role. Starting from an initial seed network, at each time step a random node, {{referred to as a}} mother node, is selected for duplication. Its daughter node is added to the network, forming a link to the mother node, and with probability p to each one of its neighbors. The degree distribution of the resulting network turns out to follow a power-law distribution, thus the ND network is a scale-free network. To calculate the DSPL we derive a master equation for the time evolution of the probability P_t(L=ℓ), ℓ= 1, 2, [...] ., where L is the distance between a pair of nodes and t is the time. Finding an exact analytical solution of the master equation, we obtain a closed form expression for P_t(L=ℓ). The mean distance, 〈 L 〉_t, and the diameter, Δ_t, are found to scale like t, namely the ND network is a small world network. The variance of the DSPL is also found to scale like t. Interestingly, the mean distance and the diameter exhibit properties of a small world network, rather than the ultrasmall world network behavior observed in other scale-free networks, in which 〈 L 〉_t ∼ t.
