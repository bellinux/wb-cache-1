25|$|In March 1926, {{working in}} Bohr's institute, Heisenberg {{realized}} that the non-commutativity implies the uncertainty principle. This implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non-commutativity, and it {{laid the foundation for}} {{what became known as the}} Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg showed that the commutation relation implies an uncertainty, or in Bohr's language a complementarity. Any two variables that do not commute cannot be measured simultaneously—the more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known. Heisenberg wrote:It can be expressed in its simplest form as follows: One can never know with perfect accuracy both of those two important factors which determine the movement of one of the smallest particles—its position and its velocity. It is impossible to determine accurately both the position and the direction and speed of a particle <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>instant.</b>|$|E

25|$|Adding {{a second}} serial {{line to the}} device, and adding another {{latching}} region would allow for the latching of two input values at the two different outputs. To perform computation, a gate that takes as inputs both serial lines at their respective outputs is added. The gate is placed over a new latching region configured to process data only when both latching regions {{at the end of}} the serial lines hold the values of interest <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>instant.</b> Figure 10 shows such an arrangement. If correctly configured, latching regions 5 and 6 will each hold input values of interest to latching region 7. At this instant, latching region 7 will let the values latched on regions 5 and 6 through the AND gate, thus the output could be configured to be the AND result of any two inputs (i.e. R and Q) by merely configuring the latching regions 5, 6 and 7.|$|E

If a few onboard magnetometers made their measurements <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>instants,</b> then one ought to check a simple geometrical compatibility of the measurement data. One can estimate constant shifts in the data and transition matrices between proper coordinate systems for each pair of magnetometers in case the check proved to be successful.

We illustrate the method by checking the compatibility of the magnetic measurements produced by the equipment Mirage onboard Foton M- 2. Note: Publication language:russia...|$|R
25|$|The coxswain {{would then}} call, 'Boat manned,' to the {{telephone}} operator at the loading station, who, in turn, reported to the 'LC' Control Room. The coxswain would then warn the troops to mind the pulleys {{at the ends of}} falls fore and aft, which could wave freely about when the craft had been set in the water. The task of hooking on and casting off from the ship required skill and seamanship from the coxswain, bowman, and sternsheetsman. The snatch blocks used were heavy steel and difficult to handle. The bowman and sternsheetsman stood by his respective block, as the craft was lowered into the water. At a time when there was sufficient slack in the falls both had to cast off <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>instant,</b> and the blocks had to be released while there was slack in the falls. If the boat was not freed at both ends at once {{the rise and fall of}} the sea could cause the boat to tip, swamp, and perhaps capsize with loss of life. Casting-off was done in all sorts of sea conditions, and the sea might be rising and falling a metre or more (6' swells were not uncommon on D-Day). A combination of skill and luck could redeem a failure to cast-off, nevertheless. On D-Day, an LCA of Royal Marine 535 Flotilla, LSI Glenearn, released all but its after falls, which were jammed, and the craft tilted alarmingly to 45 degrees. The coxswain kept his head, calming the passengers, while seamen worked to free the falls. Once free, the coxswain need to get the LCA away to prevent colliding with the towering side of the LSI as it rose and fell with the swells.|$|E

"When I {{presented}} my {{results at}} a meeting of the American Physical Society in 1923," [...] Compton later recalled, [...] "it initiated the most hotly contested scientific controversy that I have ever known."

It was particularly telling that diffraction in a crystal lattice could only be explained with reference to its wave nature. It earned Compton the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927.

40|$|More {{and more}} data mining {{algorithms}} {{are applied to}} {{a large number of}} long time series issued by many distributed sen-sors.

The stan-dard way to solve this problem is to interpolate intermediate points.

2500|$|The duel was {{arranged}} by Bainbridge with Elliott {{in a way}} that made the wounding or death of both duelists very likely.

Upon taking their places the duelists were instructed by Bainbridge, [...] "I shall give the word quickly – 'Present, one, two, three' – You are neither to fire before the word 'one', nor after the word 'three'. Now in their positions, each duelist raised his pistol, cocked the flintlock and while taking aim stood in silence. Bainbridge called out, 'One', Decatur and Barron both firing before the count of 'two'. Decatur's shot hit Barron in the lower abdomen and ricocheted into his thigh. Barron's shot hit Decatur in the pelvic area, severing arteries.

Plaisted retook the lead [...] mile into the race. Riley made a move and passed Courtney, and moved even with Plaisted. Riley and Plaisted’s racing sculls almost collided; this allowed Courtney to take very small lead just before the turning stake. Riley was able to take the lead back on the turn, but soon lost it to Courtney. Plaisted dropped out around the [...] mark due to cramps. Courtney did not give up the lead and won by five boat lengths in a time of 20 minutes and 45.75 seconds. Courtney's time was off the record mark set by Riley by a quarter of a second.
