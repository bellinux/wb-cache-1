5|$|By the 1960s, the bikini {{swimsuit}} influenced panty {{styles and}} {{coincided with the}} cut of the new lower rise jeans <b>and</b> <b>pants.</b> In the seventies, {{with the emergence of}} skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline {{and the rise of the}} leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure. From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness. Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese Scout uniform {{consists}} of a brown vest, brown pants with light blue pockets, and light blue cap for Beaver Scouts; a blue shirt, pants, and cap for Cub Scouts; khaki with green line edge shirt <b>and</b> <b>pants,</b> and a green beret for Boy Scouts; and a khaki shirt <b>and</b> <b>pants,</b> and green beret for Venture, Rover, and adult Scouts.

25|$|The team's uniforms were {{redesigned}} in 2006, {{the first}} {{significant change in the}} franchise's 46-year history.

25|$|The University of Oregon {{football}} {{team has been}} known in recent years for its unique uniform style, consisting of multiple color combinations of helmets, uniforms (both shirts <b>and</b> <b>pants),</b> socks, and shoes, resulting in a new uniform setup every week (not counting in-season changes to uniform designs). The changes have been often well-liked and praised by football recruits. New uniform schemes are coordinated by Oregon alumnus Tinker Hatfield, an executive at Nike.

Resembling other Chinese caricatures typical of the era, Chop-Chop was short with bright yellow skin, bucked teeth, and a queue. His primary role seemed to be as the chef of the Blackhawk team. Strangely, Chop-Chop was also {{the only member of the}} Blackhawks who did not wear a Blackhawk uniform; instead, he wore traditional Chinese shirt <b>and</b> <b>pants.</b>|$|E
25|$|Waterwear of Newport Beach, California, {{produced}} the natural gum-rubber Seal suit for US Divers from 1953 or earlier. Several versions were available, including one piece and two piece suits. The one piece suits were available with long or short legs and sleeves, and with front, neck or back entry. Neck entry suits were sealed by overlapping the neck opening and the hood over a grooved neck ring, and clamping {{with a large}} elastic O-ring. The two piece suit shirt <b>and</b> <b>pants</b> were also available separately and could be sealed together at the waist by a system similar to the neck entry suit.|$|E
25|$|The {{making of}} {{textiles}} and embroidery {{dates back to}} pre-Hispanic times. Traditional clothing such as rebozos, sarapes, shirts <b>and</b> <b>pants</b> are still made {{in various parts of}} the state and reflect the different indigenous communities which are found here. Hueyapan is one of the better known artisanal textile producers, with clothing items and others richly and colorfully embroidered. Both the thread used to weave the cloth and embroider it are dyed with natural dyes such as those obtained from the cochineal insect. Another area known for its textiles is Zacapoaxtla in the north of the state.|$|E

The Rams wore the throwback uniforms for two home games in 2009 – October 11 against the Minnesota Vikings and December 20 against the Houston Texans. The Rams wore their 1999 throwbacks again on October 31, 2010, when they beat the Carolina Panthers 20–10. In 1994, the team's last season in Southern California, the Rams wore jerseys <b>and</b> <b>pants</b> replicating those of their 1951 championship season for their September games with the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs.|$|E
25|$|Light {{blue and}} blue-grey work uniforms were also issued to RLAF ground and flight personnel, which {{consisted}} of a light cotton shirt <b>and</b> <b>pants.</b> The former {{was based on the}} French Army's M1948 shirt (French: Chemise de toile Mle 1948) which featured a six-buttoned front and two pleated breast pockets closed by pointed flaps, was provided with shoulder straps (French: Epaulettes) and had long sleeves with buttoned cuffs. It was worn with matching trousers similar to the French M1945/52 pattern (French: Pantalon de toile Mle 1945/52), which had two pleats at the front hips, side slashed pockets and an internal pocket at the back, on the right side.|$|E
25|$|The modern uniform {{was first}} issued {{at the start}} of the 1999 season. The overshirt was changed to the grey base with red piping and sleeves {{shortened}} so the undershirt was visible <b>and</b> <b>pants</b> were changed to grey with red piping. Also the socks changed to a plain red. The cap changed slight as the 'P' was thinned, giving a more stylistic look. In the 2002–2003 season, the Major A team wore a black undershirt and socks, as well as a black with red brimmed cap instead of the traditional red for night games played on a Friday night. The night uniform was scrapped by 2004 and the singular uniform for all senior teams returned.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1996 alterations, {{the team}} has made only minor alterations, mostly {{relating}} to jersey/pant combinations worn during specific games. For example, in 1997, against the San Francisco 49ers, the team wore midnight green jerseys <b>and</b> <b>pants</b> {{for the first of}} only two occasions in team history. The second occasion was in 2002, during the final regular season game at Veterans Stadium, a win over the division-rival Washington Redskins. A year later, {{in the first two games}} of the 2003 season (both home losses to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New England Patriots), the Eagles wore white jerseys with white pants. Since 2003, the white jerseys along with white pants have been worn during preseason games.|$|E
25|$|Other {{than the}} helmet, the uniform was {{completely}} redesigned for the 1984 season. New striping patterns {{appeared on the}} white jerseys, brown jerseys <b>and</b> <b>pants.</b> Solid brown socks were worn with brown jerseys and solid orange socks were worn with white jerseys. Brown numerals on the white jerseys were outlined in orange. White numerals on the brown jerseys were double outlined in brown and orange. (Orange numerals double outlined in brown and white appeared briefly on the brown jerseys in one pre-season game.) However, this particular uniform set was not popular with the fans, and in 1985 the uniform was returned to a look similar to the original design. It remained that way until 1995.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{clothing}} and embroidery can be most easily {{found in the}} La Huasteca area, where elaborately decorated women's blouses can be seen, especially in the El Higo and Tlalixcoyan area. In Totonacalpan, men are still often seen in white shirts <b>and</b> <b>pants</b> with a bag to hold personal items. This dress {{dates back to the}} early colonial period and had not changed much since then. Other areas specialize in wool items such as Naranjos de Amatlán, Minatilán and the city of Veracruz where items such as dresses, skirts and jackets. These and other textils such as tablecloths and napkins are often decorated with cross-stitch. Leather items include shoes, jackets, bags, wallets, belts and boots and are usually made in the La Huasteca region, Teocolo, Citlaltépetl and Naolinco.|$|E
