40|$|Intruder Noodles. Taenias are {{intestinal}} parasites of the phylum Platyhelminthes. They {{affect a}} large number of individuals, even now in the XXI century. The main species are Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) and Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm). The etymology of the term Taenia is from Greek origin meaning strip or tape. It is estimated that there are approximately 2. 5 million people affected by T. solium worldwide and 77 million by T. saginata, including 32 million in Africa. Worms are large, flat, ribbon-shaped and segmented. T. solium is two to four meters in length but may reach eight meters. T. saginata, is fatter and heavier and is four to l 4 meters in length and, in extreme cases, may reach 25 meters. They can live for 25 to 30 years. As adults, they are composed of a fixative stalk (rostrum, head or scolex) and a tape shaped body, composed of a chain of segments called proglottides. T. solium is also called <b>armed</b> <b>tapeworm</b> because it contains a double crown of hooks on the rostrum. T. saginata is said to be disarmed for not having thorns 4. In general, perhaps due to some immunological factors, the individual is parasitized by only one specimen, so it explains the term “solitary”. A professor of parasitology brought a tapeworm for demonstration into the classroom. Immediately, a student said: It looks like noodles. In fact, the comparison of the appearance between tapeworms and noodles- pasta made from flour and eggs, cut into long flat thin strips- has some didactic value and is quoted in various educational sources 1, 2. My wife Zaíra, in a timely and happy inspiration, created the title above: “Intruder Noodles”, because the tapeworm parasite is persona non grata to the intestines and is never welcome to its definitive host, which, unfortunately, is the human being. The infection of individuals is recognized by almost daily elimination of proglottides mixed with the feces (T. solium) or through evacuation...|$|E
40|$|In endemic {{areas of}} Taenia {{tapeworms}} in Korea, {{most of the}} reports showed that T. saginata was dominant over T. solium, but eating pigs is the dominant habit over eating cattle. Why do they have more T. saginata despite lower consumption of beef? This problem actually has long been recognized but until recently {{there has been no}} intensive trial to give a scientific explanation on this epidemiological enigma. By summing up the data published between the years 1963 and 1999, the ratio of <b>armed</b> versus unarmed <b>tapeworms</b> in humans was estimated at approximately 1 : 5. The ratio of pig-eaters versus cattle-eaters, however, was approximately 5 : 1. This inconsistency could be explained with the recently described T. asiatica, which infects humans through the eating of pig's viscera. We re-evaluate the importance of the consumption of visceral organ of pigs, leading us to an improved epidemiological understanding of the T. asiatica infection together with co-existing T. saginata and T. solium in Korea...|$|R
