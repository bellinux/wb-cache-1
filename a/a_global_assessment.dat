2500|$|There are {{federal laws}} {{addressing}} fair employment practices, and this also concerns performance appraisal (PA). [...] Discrimination can occur within predictions {{of performance and}} evaluations of job behaviors. [...] The revision of many court cases has revealed the involvement of alleged discrimination which was often linked to {{the assessment of the}} employee’s job performance. [...] Some of the laws which protect individuals against discrimination are [...] "the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)." [...] Lawsuits may also results from charges of an employer’s negligence, defamation, and/or misrepresentation. [...] A few appraisal criteria to keep in mind for a legally sound PA is to keep the content of the appraisal objective, job-related, behavior-based, within the control of the ratee, and related to specific functions rather than <b>a</b> <b>global</b> <b>assessment.</b> [...] Some appraisal procedure suggestions for a legally sound PA is to standardize operations, communicate formally with employees, provide information of performance deficits and give opportunities to employees to correct those deficits, give employees access to appraisal results, provide written instructions for the training of raters, and use multiple, diverse and unbiased raters. [...] These are valuable but not exhaustive lists of recommendations for PAs.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{develop and}} {{validate}} {{a definition of}} minimal disease activity (MDA) in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Methods. The clinical charts of JIA patients followed over a 16 -year period were reviewed to identify visits with high disease activity and MDA, defined {{on the basis of}} therapeutic decisions made by the attending physician. For each JIA activity measure recorded {{at the time of the}} visit, the cutoff value that best identified states of MDA was calculated by means of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. A definition of MDA for oligoarthritis and polyarthritis was set up after testing the relative power of each variable in a multivariate analysis. Validation procedures included assessment of discriminant and construct validity. Results. The definition that resulted from the analyses led to establish that a state of MDA could be defined as the presence of <b>a</b> physician <b>global</b> <b>assessment</b> < 2. 5 cm and a swollen joint count of 0 in patients with oligoarthritis; and as the presence of <b>a</b> physician <b>global</b> <b>assessment</b> < 3. 4 cm, <b>a</b> parent <b>global</b> <b>assessment</b> < 2. 1 cm, and a swollen joint count < 1 in patients with polyarthritis. Validation procedures demonstrated that the MDA definition had good discriminant and construct validity in the context of both observational studies and controlled trials. Conclusion. We developed a preliminary definition of MDA in patients with JIA that represents a useful treatment target state and is proposed for inclusion as an outcome measure in future observational studies and clinical trials in patients with JIA...|$|R

Large-scale public health crises due to mercury poisoning, such as Minamata disease and Niigata Minamata disease, drew attention to the issue.

The United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment, previously UNEP) was established shortly thereafter.
