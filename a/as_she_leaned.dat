5|$|Early in {{the battle}} {{something}} went wrong. While engaging the French galleys the Mary Rose suddenly heeled (leaned) heavily over to her starboard (right) side and water rushed in through the open gunports. The crew was powerless to correct the sudden imbalance, and could only scramble {{for the safety of}} the upper deck as the ship began to sink rapidly. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> over, equipment, ammunition, supplies and storage containers shifted and came loose, adding to the general chaos. The massive port side brick oven in the galley collapsed completely and the huge 360-litre (90 gallon) copper cauldron was thrown onto the orlop deck above. Heavy guns came free and slammed into the opposite side, impeding escape or crushing men beneath them.|$|E

50|$|Mary {{is shown}} in grief and mourning, holding the body of her son on her lap, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> over him and faces towards his crown of thorns. Christ body is emaciated, shrunken, decomposing and lacerated with the wounds of his crucifixion. Because of its small size and intimacy, the Piet√† was {{probably}} not intended for a main church altar, rather for either a side altar or home altar to be viewed by those in repentance.|$|R

At {{her feet on the}} ground lays a conical basket, or "Kathak", a grinding stone (?), and two smaller baskets. Behind her grow wild grass, brush and small trees. Part of a canyon wall is visible in the background...|$|R
60|$|That {{afternoon}} Helen {{sat with}} {{the two men in}} the library at High Maples. A roll of papers was on the table before her. When Thomas Savine had made the condition of things as plain <b>as</b> possible, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> back in her chair with crossed hands for a time.|$|R
6000|$|... "And Lady Lufton--" [...] said Lucy, {{speaking}} hardly above a whisper, {{and still}} hiding her face <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> against her sister's shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} soft {{and her voice}} shook a little <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> towards him. Something in his {{helplessness}} had kindled the protective spirit in her.|$|E
60|$|Her hand {{shot out}} towards him--an accusing hand; her eyes flashed fire <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> forward, {{gripping}} {{the arm of}} the chair with her other fingers.|$|E
40|$|Composite {{image of}} two Walapai Indian women with babies on their backs, [s. d. ]. The woman on left wears a spotted dress, a floral-printed shawl and a lightly-colored bonnet that frames her darkly-painted face. Her hands support {{the baby on}} her back <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> towards the {{patterned}} blankets that hang from the wood-paneled walls to her right. A woman behind her on the right with a baby tied on her back with her dark, floral-printed shawl. She wears a long, lightly-colored dress and her dark hair hangs over {{the sides of her}} face. Steps lead to a doorway behind the second woman. An identical image can be seen on the left...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. Eaten {{out with}} listlessness. She's neither sick nor sorry, but how dull and dreary she is, only herself can tell. When I {{get there in}} the morning, there she is sitting up in bed, for my lady don't care to get up; and then she makes me bring this book and that book, till the bed is heaped up with immense volumes that half bury her, making her look, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> upon her elbow, like the stoning of Stephen. She yawns; then she looks towards the tall glass; then she {{looks out at the}} weather, mooning her great black eyes, and fixing them on the sky as if they stuck there, while my tongue goes flick-flack along, a hundred and fifty words a minute; then she looks at the clock; then she asks me what I've been reading.' ...|$|R
60|$|At {{this present}} hour, when I give {{this out to}} my Lady to be written down, all my old pain has {{softened}} away, and I am as happy as a man can be, at this present fine old country-house of Admiral Sir George Carton, Baronet. It was my Lady Carton who herself sought me out, over a great many miles of the wide world, and found me in Hospital wounded, and brought me here. It is my Lady Carton who writes down my words. My Lady was Miss Maryon. And now, that I conclude what I had to tell, I see my Lady's honoured gray hair droop over her face, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> a little lower at her desk; and I fervently thank her for being so tender <b>as</b> I see <b>she</b> is, towards the past pain and trouble of her poor, old, faithful, humble soldier.|$|R
60|$|He {{caught the}} flash of her jewels, the soft {{brilliance}} of her eyes <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> towards him. His voice sounded, even to himself, harsh and strident.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The birds sing {{again in}} spring,' thought the child, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> at her {{casement}} window, {{and gazed at}} the declining sun. 'Spring! a beautiful and happy time!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have worked}} {{yourself}} up {{to a fine}} pass," [...] said the doctor, patting the agitated girl fondly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> against his knee. [...] "Remember, slow and steady." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{voice had}} been growing fainter and fainter <b>as</b> <b>she</b> proceeded. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> against me heavily. One glance at her {{told me that if}} I let it go on any longer she would fall into a swoon. [...] "Tell your brother that we have gone back to the rectory," [...] I said to Nugent. He looked up at Lucilla for the first time.|$|R
6000|$|Away {{with such}} dark and scaring visions! Is it not the noon {{of a summer}} night {{fragrant}} with the breath of gardens, bright with the beam that lovers love, and soft with the breath of Ausonian breezes? Within that sweet and stately residence, dwells there not a maiden fair enough to revive chivalry; who is even now thinking of him <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> on her pensive hand, or, if perchance she dream, recalls him in her visions? And himself, is he one who would cry craven with such a lot? What avail his golden youth, his high blood, his daring and devising spirit, and all his stores of wisdom, if they help not now? Does not he feel the energy divine that can confront Fate and carve out fortunes? Besides it is nigh Midsummer Eve, and what should fairies reign for but to aid such a bright pair as this? ...|$|R
5000|$|The album {{received}} mainly {{mixed reviews}} from most music critics. AllMusics senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated it two-and-a-half stars out of possible five, writing that the collaboration with Britney Spearss producer Max Martin in three tracks {{was a sign}} of [...] "desperation that underscores every minute of One Heart, where it seems like Dion will do anything to stay on the charts." [...] Erlewine also wrote that [...] "One Heart favors a smooth Vegas-showstopper gloss to radio-ready sheen, which only accentuates the lack of cohesiveness here" [...] and that the album [...] "reveals all her weaknesses." [...] Chuck Arnold of People wrote a mixed review towards the albums songs, calling it [...] "a bit jarring at times" [...] and that [...] "Dion sounds so strangely subdued on some tracks, you keep waiting for her to really let rip." [...] Either way, he wrote positively that [...] "There is a lightness to One Heart that has been missing from much of Dions previous work, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> more toward upbeat dance numbers, easy-listening rock and even borderline country-pop." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can safely}} promise that," [...] {{answered}} Sylvia, with a dismal shake of the head, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> listlessly {{from the window}} till her brother and sister were gone.|$|E
60|$|There {{were tears}} in Minnie's eyes <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> over him {{with one arm}} round his shoulder, but I fancied there was a flash of resentment in them too.|$|E
6000|$|A {{flash of}} {{surprise}} passed over her face, {{but there was}} no anger, pride, or hesitation in her manner, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> toward him with a quiet [...] "Thanks, monsieur." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{a moment}} he had found himself {{absolutely}} isolated in {{the centre of the}} room, not far from the hearth where he had stood a little while ago talking to Crystal, and close to the chair where she had sat with the light of the fire playing upon her satin gown. The cushions still bore the impress of her young figure <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had <b>leaned</b> up against them: the sight of it was an additional pain which almost made Clyffurde wince.|$|R
50|$|Shanaya {{has been}} writing music {{since the age of}} eleven. She has written, sung, and {{released}} multiple singles <b>as</b> of 2012. <b>She</b> <b>leans</b> towards creating music with eccentricity. Having a love for music as a whole, Shanaya has yet to restrain herself to a single genre or a single of anything in general. Her music is mainly alternative, with folk, rock, and blues influences.|$|R
60|$|At {{four in the}} {{afternoon}} Ravenel looked out across the garden. In {{the window of his}} hopes were set four small vases, each containing a great, full-blown rose--red and white. And, <b>as</b> he gazed, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> above them, shaming them with her loveliness and seeming to direct her eyes pensively toward his own window. And then, <b>as</b> though <b>she</b> had caught his respectful but ardent regard, she melted away, leaving the fragrant emblems on the window-sill.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you hadn't kissed me," [...] she {{declared}} {{a moment later}} <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> forward {{to look in the}} glass, [...] "I should not have eaten a mouthful of supper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What?" [...] said Estella, {{preserving}} {{her attitude}} of indifference <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; [...] "do you reproach {{me for being}} cold? You?" ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the train}} was evidently about to start, Miss Peppy's memory became {{suddenly}} very acute, and a rush of forgotten directions almost choked her <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> out of the window.|$|E
50|$|Clark‚Äôs Self Portrait is a {{statement}} of personal strength and perhaps even independence from her former teacher, for although she borrows from Petrov-Vodkin‚Äôs compositional methods, he discouraged his students from using black. She {{made the decision to}} use black in the painting, creating her own aesthetic and moving away from the style of her teacher. She loved black, and it seems almost like a gesture of defiance to build a self-portrait around it. Looking at the self-portrait, the painting is unified by the tilt of the figure and the slanted architectural elements and the use of this kind of architectural framing device reflects the influence of her teacher Petrov-Vodkin. Clark employs the techniques she learned from her teacher‚Äîand utilized framing elements like doors, to structure her paintings. This can be seen in her painting Self Portrait,. This portrait reflects Clark‚Äôs growth as an artist and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> against a door, we sense her strength stabilizing the canvas. Clark, in this self-portrait is embracing her strong facial features and accentuates them by employing minimal colour, allowing the lines of her dress to speak of understated elegance, the slight smile‚Äîher confidence.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a private-values buyer-seller problem with multiple objects. Valuations are binary, i. i. d., and {{such that the}} problem {{does not have a}} trivial solution. We characterize mechanisms that span the Pareto frontier. These have a very simple form: Call the seller "good " if he has a low valuation and "bad " if he has a high valuation. Call the buyer "good " if he has a high valuation and "bad " if he has a low valuation. For each object, if both say "bad" ‚Äî there is no trade. If both say "good " ‚Äî they trade. If agent j says "bad " and the other says "good", they trade only if the number of good objects in j‚Äôs announcement is above a certain threshold (at the threshold itself they trade with probability between 0 and 1). The thresholds depend on the weights given to each agent in the designer‚Äôs objective function: <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> more towards one of the agents, his trading threshold weakly decreases, and the rival‚Äôs weakly increases. ‚àóWe thank Eddie Dekel, Matt Jackson, Nadav Levy and semimar participants at Tel Aviv University for helpful comments and discussions. 1...|$|R
