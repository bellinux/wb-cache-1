Using these informations, {{an analysis of}} kinematic correlations between the two and three heaviest projectile fragments in their rest frame was performed. The sensitivity of these correlations to the conditions at breakup was verified within the schematic SOS-model. For a quantitative investigation, the data were compared to calculations with statistical multifragmentation models and to classical three-body calculations. With classical trajectory calculations, where the charges and masses of the fragments are taken from a Monte Carlo sampling of the experimental events, the dynamical observables can be reproduced. The deduced breakup parameters, however, differ considerably from those assumed in the statistical multifragmentation models which describe the charge correlations. If, on the other hand, the analysis of kinematic and charge correlations is performed for events with two and three heavy fragments produced by statistical multifragmentation codes, a good agreement with the data is found with the exception that the fluctuation widths of the intrinsic fragment energies are significantly underestimated.

The spectrum of 13 Li is interpreted as a resonance at an energy of Er = 1. 47 (13) MeV and a width of Gamma ~ 2 MeV superimposed on a broad correlated background distribution. The isotope 10 Li is observed after one-neutron knockout from the halo nucleus 11 Li.

The observation of the nucleus 8 He in coincidence with one or two neutrons, as a result of proton knockout from 11 Li, allows to reconstruct the relative-energy spectra for the heavy helium isotopes, 9 He and 10 He.

40|$|At the <b>ALADIN</b> <b>spectrometer</b> of the GSI {{in october}} 1991 {{for the first}} time the new {{multiple}} ionization chamber was applied, in the two anode planes of which are additional multiwire-proportional counters. The proportional counters are required in order to make the detection of light fragments (Z< 10) possible and additionally to measure the coordinate of all particles. Because the proportional counters were not tacted, the effect of space charges on the measurement of particle trajectories could be studied. In this case the primarily produced electrons drift into the proportional counters and are multiplied on the anode wires. A part of the positive ions produced thereby leave the counter and drift back to the MUSIC cathode. At high beam intensities of up to 10 " 4 gold projectiles per second by these positive space charges the homogeneous electric field of the MUSIC is disturbed. This effect is especially strong in the beam plane. As consequence of the space charge additionally electrons are focused on the proportional counter so that their amplitudes in dependence on the beam intensity increase up to the 2. 5 -fold. Furthermore the y coordinate is falsified, because the electrons are diverted to the medium plane. On the measurement of the x coordinate this diversion has with maximally 0. 1 % only a small influence. These space-charge effects can be qualitatively described by a schematic model, which assumes a stationary positive space charge. Additionally for the proportional counters, which are not in the beam plane, their resolution was determined. In these counters the space-charge effects are small, because essentially fewer particles are registrated than in the medium MWPC's. By this charges of fragments with Z< 10 could be separated. The charge resolution amounted at lithium 0. 8 charge units. The position resolution of the proportional counters in y direction was determined to less than 8 mm.
