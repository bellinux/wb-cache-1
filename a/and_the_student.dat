Students from Illinois began to replace out-of-state students, the percentage of day, or commuting, students rose, and the school employed more lay teachers. After the war, the previously ethnic Czech college acquired a more diverse student body, due to rising enrollment caused by the G.I. Bill. By 1947 the high school enrolled 30 students.

5|$|Access to Scottish {{universities}} {{was probably}} more open than in contemporary England, Germany or France. Attendance was less expensive <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> body {{more representative of}} society as a whole. In the eighteenth century Scotland reaped the intellectual benefits of this system in its contribution the European Enlightenment. Key figures in the Scottish Enlightenment who had made their mark before the mid-eighteenth century included Francis Hutcheson (1694–1746), who was professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow from 1729 to 1746. He was an important link between the ideas of Shaftesbury and the later school of Scottish Common Sense Realism, developing Utilitarianism and Consequentialist thinking. Colin Maclaurin (1698–1746), appointed to a chair of mathematics {{by the age of}} 19 at Marischal College, was the leading British mathematician of his era. Perhaps the most significant intellectual figure of early modern Scotland was David Hume (1711–76) whose Treatise on Human Nature (1738) and Essays, Moral and Political (1741) helped outline the parameters of philosophical Empiricism and Scepticism. He would be a major influence of later Enlightenment figures including Adam Smith, Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham.|$|E

Second, <b>the</b> kinds of code switching used by <b>the</b> teacher <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> were: (1) based on the topic changing (situational code switching and metaphorical code switching), (2) based on scope of setting (intrasentential code switching, intersentential code switching, and tag question), (3) based on permanent code switching (permanent code switching and temporary code switching), and (4) based on language used (internal code switching and external code switching). The last result was the reason of the usage of code switching. The teacher used code switching to clarify the difficult concepts or terms to make <b>the</b> <b>students</b> understand some information or knowledge easily during the classroom instruction; to avoid boring situation; and to maintain conducive communication. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>students</b> used code switching because they lacked ability in using certain English terms to answer and ask questions in the class...|$|R
