25|$|Ontological hermeneutics {{provides}} {{a way for the}} clients and therapist to work together to create subjective truth and meaning for the client. Where other therapies such as Cognitive-behavioral therapy, Rational-emotive behavioral therapy, Dialectical-behavioral therapy, and other eclectic approaches frequently create a conflict between freedom and commitment for the client. For example, a client seeing a counselor may want to work on becoming more of an individual by exploring his or her self-concept by finding personal meaning, breaking away from social trends and peer pressure, and discovering his or her own interests. Therapists utilizing traditional theories, like cognitive behavioral therapy, rational emotive behavioral therapy, or even eclectic approaches, will guide the client in this process according to how the therapist's chosen therapy would say about how an individual ought to go about this process. In other words, the client will have to commit to exploring his or her self-concept based on how cognitive behavioral therapy, or another therapy, says the client should learn <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> are, therefore limiting the amount of freedom afforded to the client to creatively develop his or her own ways of self-exploration. Proponents of ontological hermeneutics state that hermeneutic psychotherapy strives to provide freedom to the client by affording his or her voice a privileged position in therapy to develop their own options.|$|E

The exclusion caused d'Elci much embarrassment, and he became sick and quickly died after the French veto was announced.

He was shot together with his students. One German soldier was shot for refusing {{to participate in the}} killings. A German report stated: [...] "The executions in Kragujevac occurred although there had been no attacks on members of the Wehrmacht in this city, for the reason that not enough hostages could be found elsewhere."

During a break between {{the development of the}} first six episodes of the season and the remaining episodes, the writing staff was contemplating what direction they should take with the romantic relationship between Andy and April. Parks co-creator Michael Schur said they wanted to avoid the [...] "standard-issue TV romance plots: fights, other men/women driving them apart, and so on". They decided the two should get married after dating for only a short time because it was funny, it made sense with the characters' personalities, and it raised the stakes for future stories involving the two. Schur said: [...] "We just thought <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> were [...] two impulsive goofballs who don’t approach their lives in a responsible, adult manner [...] and decided, what the hell? What if they just make a rash decision and get hitched?" ...|$|E

The song was produced by Madonna, West, Dean and Symbolyc One, with co-production by Charlie Heat and additional production by Travis Scott. The song's demo was leaked to the internet in December 2014, with twelve other tracks from the album. Its final version was released on December 20, 2014, with five other tracks on iTunes store as [...] "an early Christmas gift" [...] to avoid further leaks. The song's demo version features dance synths and acoustic guitars; after showing the song to West, he felt connected to the song and changed it to a darker sound. The song was conceived after Madonna was {{accused of being a}} member of the Illuminati; she wanted to write a song <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> really are and what they are not.|$|E

In addition, Jinkins and the series' developers paid particular attention to more hidden elements within the series, such as the founding fathers of the show's central town. In writing the series, the production schedule was built around spending several weeks writing the series' scripts. Jinkins asked each writer to place a central theme {{at the top of}} each script — what issue Doug is dealing with, and what he learns. Jinkins often told staff that he wanted the show to remain relevant [...] "in 30 years," [...] aiming for a timeless effect. While developing the series, Jinkins wanted to change its name from Doug to The Funnies, but the network encouraged him to stick with the original name. There was a [...] "cross-pollination" [...] among the network's writing staff. This involved story editors being assigned to the show, among them Mitchell Kriegman of Clarissa Explains It All and Will McRobb of The Adventures of Pete & Pete. [...] "There was definitely camaraderie and a quirkiness <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> were hiring," [...] Jinkins later said. [...] "Sometimes it didn't work quite so well, but working with McRobb was awesome!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Preseason {{speculation}} ran high {{about what}} would happen with the Buccaneers’ first overall choice in the draft, with Houston Oilers’ coach Bum Phillips reportedly stating that the Oilers would better any other team's offer to the Buccaneers. Unlike the previous year, when it was made clear early on that Ricky Bell was to be their choice, the Buccaneers kept quiet <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> might draft, further fueling speculation about a trade. The New York Jets were said to have offered their fourth-overall draft pick, plus any player on their roster other than Richard Todd. Tight end was considered to be the Buccaneers’ single greatest need, with Ken MacAfee of Notre Dame often mentioned as a likely draft target. According to Don Shula, [...] "With John McKay's type of offense, an outstanding tight end is absolutely essential. It cannot go without one". This happened {{to be one of the}} positions hit hardest by injury in 1977. With most of their mid-round draft picks traded away, the Buccaneers were looking for a trade that would bring them several draft picks. With no teams willing to give up a starting quarterback as part of a deal, the Buccaneers eventually traded the pick to the Oilers, for tight end Jimmie Giles and the Oilers’ first- and second-round picks in 1978, and their third- and fifth-round picks in 1979. Needing a fullback, the Buccaneers shortly afterward traded Anthony Davis to the Oilers for Don Hardeman.|$|E

2500|$|Madonna's {{inspiration}} {{to direct the}} film came from the controversial lives of Edward and Simpson. She recalled from her experience that if she brought up King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson {{at a dinner party}} or a social gathering, [...] "it's like throwing a Molotov cocktail into the room. Everyone erupts into an argument <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> were. I mean, they were very controversial– and continue to be. So, of course, I'm very attracted to that." [...] She investigated the history behind the abdication and tried to understand what led Edward to leave his royal throne. The singer spent two years researching the life of Simpson and writing the script. She wallpapered an empty room in her house with pictures from auction catalogues and photographs of the Duke and Duchess throughout their lives. [...] "I was sitting in a room that was completely and utterly inundated with their images so I could soak up their energy. I was trying {{to understand the nature of}} their love story and trying to figure out for myself if there is such a thing as perfect love," [...] she said. However, not interested in making a biopic about Simpson, Madonna created the modern-day story about the character Wally Winthrop, so that she could have a point of view in which to tell the narrative. She explained later: [...] "We can all read the same history book and have a different point of view. So it was important for me to not present the story and say, 'This is the one and only story,' but to say, 'This story moved me and inspired me.' That's how the two love stories were created." ...|$|E
