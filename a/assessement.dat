For a set of selected equity indexes we compare its relevancy for the 1 -year 99. 5 % Value At Risk (VaR) assessment with the different releases of the Solvency II dampener equity models. In a second step we test its relevancy for VaR assessments beyond a 1 year investment horizon.

Phylogenetic analyses using one nuclear and three chloroplast regions confirm the monophyly of the Pinaceae. Results also show that the Pinoideae is sister to Abietoideae and Keteleeria is sister to Abies. Results suggest {{that the number of}} sections in Abies probably need to be reduced to eight rather than ten. The Mexican species are placed in two sections currently but are shown to be monophyletic. The Mediterranean group of species is also shown to be monophyletic but there is little resolution within this clade, again reducing the sectional level of classification appears appropriate in this case. Several origins are speculated for this group including a North American origin via long distance dispersal; however, perhaps the most likely pattern is one of a pan-northern hemispherical distribution subsequently fragmented into refugia from which modem clades have diversified relatively recently.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on what is {{considered}} to be a suitable foster home. For the study to be carried out an application had to be made to get access to the foster home assessments in a medium-sized municipality in Sweden. With the support of attachment theory and theory of standards different categories have been picked out and analyzed in foster home <b>assessements</b> that have been approved. The conclusion to what {{is considered to be}} a suitable foster home is a complex issue, as there are many factors that are interacting. Social workers seem to focus on the importance of a family’s ability to provide some kind of stability and security for a child who is considered to be placed within their home. An important feature that the parents need to show is some kind of potential to form a secure attachment for a child. The foster home may be considered suitable regardless of the foster parents background and current situation as long as the foster child has the potential to form a secure attachment to either of them. In a normative perspectiv the foster parents should have a good and stable relationship and the foster home should be placed close to nature. Another feature that the social workers seem to prefer is to place a child in a foster home where the foster parents are related or somehow closely connected to the child...|$|R

Through the SHIVA ANR project, we are seeking a method to assess and map the vulnerability of farmers in southern India to both climate and socioeconomic changes, and secondly, to assess {{the costs and benefits}} associated with trends farmers' vulnerability in the medium and long-term. The project is focusing on southern India 's hard rock area, as in the geological context, both surface and ground water resources are naturally limited. We are also focusing on farming populations as these are the main water users in the area and rely exclusively on groundwater. The area covers southern India's semi-arid zone, where the rainfall gradient ranges from 600 mm to 1100 mm.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} decades and centuries, European {{mountain}} landscapes have experienced substantial transformations. Natural and anthropogenic LULC changes (land use and land cover changes), especially agro-pastoral activities, have directed influenced the spatial organization and composition of European mountain landscapes. For the past 60 years, natural reforestation has been occurring due {{to a decline in}} both agricultural production activities and rural population. Stakeholders, to better anticipate future changes, need spatially and temporally explicit models to identiy areas at risk of land change and possible abandonment. This paper presents an integrated approach combining forecasting scenarios and a LULC changes simulation model to assess where LULC changes may occur in the Pyrenees Mountains, based on historical LULC trands and a range of future socio-economic drivers. The proposed methodology considers local specificities of Pyrenan valleys, sub-regional climate and topographical properties, and regional economic policies. Results indicate that some regions are projected to face strong abandonment, regardless of scenario conditions. Overall, high rates of change are associated with administrative regions where land productivity is highly dependent on socio-economic drivers and climatic and environmental conditions limit intensive (agricultural and/or pastoral) production and profitability. The combination of the results for the four scenarios allows <b>assessements</b> of where encroachment (e. g. colonization by shrublands) and reforestation are the most probable. This assessment intends to provide insight into the potential future development of the Pyrenees to help identify areas that are the most sensitive to change and to guide decision makers to help their management decisions...|$|R
40|$|Zebrafish {{are widely}} used as model organism. Their {{suitability}} for endocrine studies, drug screening and toxicity <b>assessements</b> depends {{on the extent of}} conservation of specific genes and biochemical pathways between zebrafish and human. Glucocorticoids consist of inactive 11 -keto (cortisone and 11 -dehydrocorticosterone) and active 11 β-hydroxyl forms (cortisol and corticosterone). In mammals, two 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11 β-HSD 1 and 11 β-HSD 2) interconvert active and inactive glucocorticoids, allowing tissue-specific regulation of glucocorticoid action. Furthermore, 11 β-HSDs are involved in the metabolism of 11 -oxy androgens. As zebrafish and other teleost fish lack a direct homologue of 11 β-HSD 1, we investigated whether they can reduce 11 -ketosteroids. We compared glucocorticoid and androgen metabolism between human and zebrafish using recombinant enzymes, microsomal preparations and zebrafish larvae. Our results provide strong evidence for the absence of 11 -ketosteroid reduction in zebrafish. Neither human 11 β-HSD 3 nor the two zebrafish 11 β-HSD 3 homologues, previously hypothesized to reduce 11 -ketosteroids, converted cortisone and 11 -ketotestosterone (11 KT) to their 11 β-hydroxyl forms. Furthermore, zebrafish microsomes were unable to reduce 11 -ketosteroids, and exposure of larvae to cortisone or the synthetic analogue prednisone did not affect glucocorticoid-dependent gene expression. Additionally, a dual-role of 11 β-HSD 2 by inactivating glucocorticoids and generating the main fish androgen 11 KT was supported. Thus, {{due to the lack of}} 11 -ketosteroid reduction, zebrafish and other teleost fish exhibit a limited tissue-specific regulation of glucocorticoid action, and their androgen production pathway is characterized by sustained 11 KT production. These findings are of particular significance when using zebrafish as a model to study endocrine functions, stress responses and effects of pharmaceuticals...|$|R
