From a totally centralized model,Vietnam’s accreditation {{system has been}} becoming more independent, especially {{with the establishment of}} accrediting agencies.

This paper investigates the development ofVietnam’s higher {{education quality}} assurance and accreditation for the last decade since the national quality assurance organization was established. The study first synthesizes the results achieved within this system, both in policy and practice, leadership and management. It also discusses human resources development for quality assurance and accreditation in the national context. Next, the paper highlights the self-evaluation and external evaluation activities, two most important steps of the accreditation process. In addition, building quality culture within higher education institutions is also paid attention to. Finally, lessons from the establishment and development ofVietnam’s accreditation are drawn. This study looks at an overall picture ofVietnam’s higher education quality assurance system since its establishment with a focus on policy, practice, leadership and management. It also hopes to contribute to the literature related to accreditation ofVietnam’s higher education...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundChronic fatigue {{syndrome}} (CFS) affects at least 4 {{million people in}} the United States, yet only 16 % of people with CFS have received a diagnosis or medical care for their illness. Educating health care professionals about the diagnosis and management of CFS may help to reduce population morbidity associated with CFS. MethodsThis report presents findings over a 5 -year period from May 2000 to June 2006 during which we developed and implemented a health care professional educational program. The objective of the program was to distribute CFS continuing education materials to providers at professional conferences, offer online continuing education credits in different formats (e. g., print, video, and online), and evaluate the number of <b>accreditation</b> <b>certificates</b> awarded. ResultsWe found that smaller conference size (OR = 80. 17; 95 % CI 8. 80, 730. 25), CFS illness related target audiences (OR = 36. 0; 95 % CI 2. 94, 436. 34), and conferences in which CFS research was highlighted (OR = 4. 15; 95 % CI 1. 16, 14. 83) significantly contributed to higher dissemination levels, as measured by visit rates to the education booth. While print and online courses were equally requested for continuing education credit opportunities, the online course resulted in 84 % of the overall award certificates, compared to 14 % for the print course. This remained consistent across all provider occupations: physicians, nurses, physician assistants, and allied health professionals. ConclusionThese findings suggest that educational programs promoting materials at conferences may increase dissemination efforts by targeting audiences, examining conference characteristics, and promoting online continuing education forums...|$|R

This research found that the nature of environmental disclosures of listed companies on the Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) within the Food and Drinks Sector are not as comprehensive as those of other Sectors of the ISE. Furthermore, this research found that the extent of their environmental disclosures goes no further than environmental mission statements, small amounts of quantitative data, and listed <b>accreditations</b> and <b>certificates</b> companies had received with regard to their environmental practices. Despite the number of companies within this Sector disclosing environmental information within their Annual Reports increasing over the past eight years, the quality of information disclosed has not greatly improved. Additionally, this dissertation investigated the perceptions of senior management of the ISE listed companies within the Food and Drinks Sector with regard to environmental reporting. The researcher made recommendations as to how companies and the Government can increase and improve the level of environmental reporting, both within the Food and Drinks Sector and in other Sectors of the ISE.
