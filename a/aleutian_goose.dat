[...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Forestry, Watershed and Wildland Sciences, 2014 Private pasture lands managed with {{rotational}} grazing practices for beef cattle production are being utilized by Aleutian cackling geese (Branta hutchinsii leucopareia) during their annual migration through northern California. Continued {{growth in the}} population size of this species has led to increased reports of forage depredation in pastures used by geese. To quantify reports of forage losses, research was conducted to determine effects different grazing conditions have on pasture regrowth. Field work was completed during the <b>Aleutian</b> <b>goose</b> spring staging periods in late winter/early spring in 2008 / 2009 and 2009 / 2010 on three ranches each season. Responses in pasture regrowth were studied under three different grazing conditions utilizing multiple study pastures on each ranch: 1) no grazing; 2) grazing by cattle only; and 3) grazing by cattle and Aleutian geese. Results from analyses showed that different grazing conditions led to statistically significant differences in pasture regrowth. Across all ranches over both seasons, regrowth in pastures with no grazing was 62...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2010 The {{recovered}} {{population of}} Aleutian cackling goose (Branta hutchinsii leucopareia) uses pastures of Humboldt and Del Norte Counties in spring {{prior to the}} final migration to breeding grounds in Alaska. The availability of energetically profitable foraging sites is critical for geese to meet body condition thresholds that ultimately regulate survival and reproduction in the population. However, selection of these profitable foraging sites puts geese in conflict with livestock agriculture and {{this has lead to}} increased hazing and hunting activities. Patterns of <b>Aleutian</b> <b>goose</b> field use were observed and related to characteristics of fields including farm type, spatial location, and disturbance. I found that a spatial discrepancy exists on the spring landscape; geese selected fields closer to roosts and tidal sloughs, further from roads and structures, which were larger in area, with a greater surface area of water. Additionally, a temporal discrepancy exits throughout spring staging; distribution and abundance patterns of geese on foraging fields are dynamic and best predicted by shifting relationships of farm type, spatial characteristics, and disturbance at different periods throughout spring. Increased disturbance on the landscape has caused notable shifts in distribution and use of available fields. By identifying habitat features of fields that attract the most geese we can better approach a description of the birds??? requirements leading to designing suitable ???goose friendly??? habitats and reducing the burden on individual farmers...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, 1980 A {{study to}} {{determine}} the migration and wintering ground distribution, ecology, and population status of the endangered <b>Aleutian</b> Canada <b>goose</b> (Branta canadensis leucopareia) was conducted from October 1975 to May 1978. Field investigations extended from the western Aleutian Islands, Alaska, to the. Central Valley of California. Prior to and during the study, 536 <b>Aleutian</b> <b>geese</b> were banded to document movement and survival. It was determined that the geese use traditional migration and wintering areas away from Alaska, returning to virtually the same fields annually. During September, <b>Aleutian</b> Canada <b>geese</b> migrate along the Aleutian Island chain from Buldir Island near the western end to the easternmost island of Unimak and then apparently shift southeast on a transoceanic flight. The geese arrive in California in early October; some stop near Crescent City, but most birds continue to the Sacramento Valley where over 95 {{percent of the population}} uses a small agricultural area in the Butte Sink. From mid-November to early December the geese move southward via the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to the grasslands of the upper San Joaquin Valley. Most of the birds are present as a single flock near Modesto from at least late December to early February. They begin shifting southward to an area near Los Banos in mid-January, and some are present until mid-March. <b>Aleutian</b> <b>geese</b> start moving northward to the Crescent City staging grounds as early as mid-January, with most of the birds arriving during March. They peak in number there in late March and early April when nearly the entire known iv population is present. In mid-April, geese begin to leave Crescent City to the breeding grounds, and by late April or early May all have left. Although a few <b>Aleutian</b> Canada <b>geese</b> have been reported near the mouth of the Columbia River, Washington, most apparently make a transoceanic flight to the eastern Aleutians. There, they continue westward to Buldir where they have been seen as early as the first week of May. During the study, hunting and avian cholera were found to be the main sources of winter mortality. Closure on Canada goose hunting enacted in three areas of California {{at the onset of the}} study has reduced mortality from an estimated preclosure rate of 22. 5 percent annually to approximately 11. 5 percent during winters 1975 - 76 and 1976 - 77. This winter mortality may comprise the majority of the annual loss. The spring population increased 45. 6 percent, from 790 in April 1975 to 1150 in March 1977. Management needs on the migration and wintering grounds include continuation of protection of the geese through hunting closures and maintenance of suitable habitat conditions on their major use areas...|$|R
50|$|Castle Rock National Wildlife Refuge is 0.5 mi {{offshore}} from Crescent City {{in northern}} California.

40|$|The current {{endangered}} species list has its administrative beginnings in 1964 when the Department of the Interior 2 ̆ 7 s Committee on Rare and Endangered Wildlife Species published a preliminary list of 62 species at risk of extinction (Goble, forthcoming). Following {{the enactment of the}} Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966 (ESPA), the secretary of the interior in 1967 published the first official list of 78 2 ̆ 2 native fish and wildlife threatened with extinction 2 ̆ 2 (ESPA sec. l(c); U. S. Department of the Interior 1967; Wilcove and McMillan, this volume). By the time the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was adopted in 1973, there were 392 species on the list (Yaffee 1982). These first lists included only vertebrate species. On the thirtieth anniversary of the ESA, the number stood at 1, 260 domestic species and 558 foreign species (USFWS 2003 a), with plant and invertebrate species outnumbering vertebrates. This chapter presents a graphical summary encapsulating thirty years of species protection and restoration under the ESA. The summary reveals both gains and losses. For some species, such as the <b>Aleutian</b> Canada <b>goose</b> (Branta canadensis leucopareia), the process worked as it was meant to, reversing decline and restoring populations to healthy levels (USFWS 2001 a); for others, such as the dusky seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus nigrescens), the process failed, and despite being listed the species continued to spiral toward eventual extinction (USFWS 1983; Walters 1992). What follows is an assessment of the state of species protection as it has evolved under the ESA. This includes the taxonomie and demographie distribution of listed species, and the number of critical habitat designations.

5000|$|In June 2009, {{the island}} was {{declared}} rat-free {{for the first time}} in 229 years, although the site will be continually monitored for another two years for confirmation. In the preceding autumn, helicopters dropped brodifacoum poison onto the island from buckets for a week, which eliminated the rat population. Signs show that several species of birds, including <b>Aleutian</b> cackling <b>geese,</b> ptarmigan, peregrine falcons, and black oystercatchers, are starting to nest again on the island. [...] However, the associated nontarget mortality, i.e., the deaths of animals other than the rats, was significant. [...] Some non-target mortality was expected, but the actual quantity greatly exceeded what was predicted. The Ornithological Council reported that more than 420 birds were killed as a result of the rat eradication program. Forty-six bald eagles died (exceeding the known population of 22 bald eagles on the island); toxicological analysis revealed lethal levels of brodifacoum in 12 of the 16 carcasses tested. Of the 320 glaucous-winged gull carcasses collected, toxicology tests implicated brodifacoum in 24 of the 34 tested. Fifty-four carcasses of another 25 bird species were found. The report found that the lead contractor which the FWS used, Island Conservation, had dropped more poisonous bait than they had proposed, including bait which was intended to be saved as a backup.

40|$|Castle Rock National Wildlife Refuge is a 6. 4 ha island located 0. 8 km off {{the coast}} of Crescent City, California. Castle Rock is the second largest seabird breeding-colony along the California coast, the largest Common Murre colony in the California Current, and hosts more than 100, 000 seabirds. Eleven {{different}} species are known to have nested on this island including: Common Murre (Uria aalge), Brandt???s (Phalacrocorax penicillatus), Pelagic (Phalacrocorax pelagicus), and Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus), Pigeon Guillemots (Cepphus columba), Cassin???s (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) and Rhinoceros Auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata), Tufted Puffins (Fratercula cirrhata), Western Gulls (Larus occidentalis), and Fork-tailed (Oceanodroma furcata) and Leach???s Storm Petrels (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) (Carter et al. 1992). The <b>Aleutian</b> Cackling <b>Goose</b> (Branta hutchinsii leucopareia) population has recovered from less than 800 in 1974 to more than 100, 000 today (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2001) and large numbers (20, 000) of geese have been roosting overnight on Castle Rock in the spring. These geese have the potential to alter habitats at the island. Brown Pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) have also roosted at Castle Rock in great numbers (1 - 2, 000) during the fall. Castle Rock is situated midway along the U. S. Pacific Coast between two other major seabird colonies in the California Current: the Farallon Islands off the central California coast to the south and Three Arch Rocks off the Oregon coast to the north. Unlike the Farallon Islands, Castle Rock is much closer to shore and thus closer to many types of anthropogenic threats. However it is far enough off shore that observations or protections from the mainland have been very limited. Research and monitoring have been taking place at the Farallon Islands since 1971 (Ainley and Boekelheide 1990) and Three Arch Rocks has been a National Wildlife Refuge since 1907, while Castle Rock does not have a history of monitoring or conservation-based management and was privately owned until 1979 (it became a National Wildlife Refuge in 1980). The status of breeding seabird populations at Castle Rock are poorly known (except Common Murres) and cannot be assumed to mimic those of other seabird colonies such as the Farallon Islands or Three Arch Rocks (Parker 2005). Good estimates of the abundance of Common Murres and cormorants using the surface of Castle Rock can be obtained using aerial photos (Capitolo et al. 2006). Pigeon Guillemots and Tufted Puffins have been surveyed by boat because they are active diurnally at and around Castle Rock (Carter et al. 1992; Jaques and Strong 2001). However the burrow-nesting nocturnal species (Rhinoceros and Cassin???s Auklets, Fork-tailed and Leach???s Storm-petrels) are not easily seen because they are at sea feeding during the day and only come to the island between sunset and sunrise when they relieve their mate of incubation duties or feed their young. Further, human activity on the island has been very restricted with very few landings (Table 1). The burrow systems can be destroyed or badly damaged when stepped on by people which necessitates restriction of human visitation and also limits access for monitoring. Common murres are sensitive to the presence of people during the breeding season which prevents researchers from visiting the island from April to August (Thayer et al. 1999; Carter et al. 2001). Therefore nocturnal species have posed a very difficult challenge to study or monitor for trends. Based on past surveys conducted after the nesting period, Castle Rock probably still hosts substantial numbers of these burrow-nesting species; Castle Rock was the largest breeding colony of Rhinoceros auklets in California {{at the time of the}} last state-wide seabird survey (Carter et al. 1992). Despite the importance of this colony to these species in California, the current status of auklets and storm-petrels on the island is unknown. U. S.
