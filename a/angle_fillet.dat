40|$|Past {{experience}} {{has shown that}} stringer-to-cross-girder connections in riveted railway bridges are susceptible to fatigue cracking. This fatigue damage is caused by secondary stresses, which develop in the different components of the connection. For this reason, more detailed analysis techniques are needed to capture this type of behaviour. In this paper, a finite element (FE) model of a typical riveted railway bridge is developed by incorporating the detailed local geometry of a stringer-to-cross-girder connection into the global bridge model. Before {{the development of this}} model, benchmark FE studies are carried out on a double-lap joint and the results are presented in terms of stress concentration factors and stress gradients. Further verification studies are carried out on a local bridge connection FE model, in terms of its rotational stiffness. After this investigation, a refined FE model of the bridge is analysed under the passage of a freight train. Principal stress histories at different components of the connection are obtained, which are then combined with the plain material S–N curve, in order to identify the most fatigue-critical locations of the connection. These are identified as being the rivet holes and, in some cases, the <b>angle</b> <b>fillet.</b> By considering different rivet clamping stresses and different rivet defect scenarios it is found that the most damaging effects are caused by the presence of clearance between the rivet shank and the hole, and the loss of a rivet. The rivet clamping stress is also found to affect fatigue damage considerably...|$|E
40|$|A {{new version}} of ECB has been {{completed}} that allows nonuniform grid spacing and a new dieledric boundary condition. ECB was developed to retain the simplicity and speed of an orthogonal mesh while capturing much of the fidelity of adaptive, unstructured finite element meshes. Codes based on orthogonal meshes are {{easy to work with}} and lead to well-posed elliptic and parabolic problems that are comparatively easy to solve. Generally, othogonal mesh representations lead to banded matrices while unstructured representations lead to more complicated sparse matrices. Recent advances in adapting banded linear systems to massively parallel computers reinforce our opinion that iterative field solutions utilizing banded matrix methods will continue to be competitive. Unfortunately, the underlying ``stair-step`` boundary representation in simple orthogonal mesh (and recent Adaptive Mesh Refinement) applications is inadequate. With ECB, the curved boundary is represented by piece-wise-linear representations of curved internal boundaries embedded into the orthogonal mesh- we build better, but not more, coefficients in the vicinity of these boundaries-and we use the surplus free energy on more ambitious physics models. ECB structures are constructed out of the superposition of analytically prescribed building blocks. In 2 -D, we presently use a POLY 4 (linear boundaries defined by 4 end points), an ANNULUS, (center, inner & outer radii, starting & stopping angle), a ROUND (starting point & angle, stopping point & <b>angle,</b> <b>fillet</b> radius). A link-list AIRFOIL has also been constructed. In the ECB scheme, we first find each intercept of the structure boundary with an I or J grid line is assigned an index K. We store the actual z,y value at the intercept, and the slope of the boundary at that intercept, in arrays whose index K is associated with the corresponding mesh point just inside the structure. In 2 -D, a point just outside a structure may have up to 4 intercepts associated with it. We now construct PieceWise Linear Segments (PWLS) -from the slope and intercept- that will serve as the computational boundary-a boundary constructed as a superposition of the analytic elements given as input. The intersection of these PWLSs with other nearby PWLSs define the end- points. We insist that there be an endpoint within each cell for each sequence of PWLSs coming through that cell. We give directionality to a PWLS by the convention that looking from point 1 to point 2 will place the interior of the structure on the left. This scheme allows the generalization to those boundary structures that do not actually have any mesh points inside a structure. Since these structures are defined by their analytically defined bounding walls, points can always be found that are ``inside`` a given wall segment-even though it may, in fact, be outside the opposite bounding segment. Such subgrid geometry is useful, for example, in a gun configuration with a thin electrode, perhaps not parallel to any axes of the orthogonal mesh, in which the electrode simply contributes to an external focusing field...|$|E
40|$|A system-based {{model for}} fatigue {{assessment}} of riveted railway bridge connections, comprising {{a number of}} basic components, is presented in this article. Probabilistic fatigue load spectra are developed through Monte Carlo simulation of train passages over a finite element model of a typical, short-span bridge. Uncertainties arising from loading, resistance and modelling sources are taken into account. The riveted connection is treated {{through a set of}} generic sub-systems that capture potential damage in identifiable hot-spots, such as rivets, holes and <b>angle</b> <b>fillets.</b> The fatigue reliability over time is evaluated through system reliability methods by treating these hot-spots as the elements of a structural system. The results show that the probability of failure of the connection depends significantly on the form of the system adopted for the analysis and the rivet clamping force.

40|$|Strain {{distribution}} of Al 1100 was numerically investigated during cyclic expansion extrusion (CEE) process using {{finite element method}} (FEM). Die <b>angle,</b> corner <b>fillet</b> radius and die chamber diameter were considered as die parameters and friction factor and number of passes as process parameters. The effects of these parameters were investigated on the effective strain and strain homogeneity in the CEE process. Results showed that the decrease of friction factor along {{with the increase of}} die <b>angle,</b> corner <b>fillet</b> radius and number of passes lead to more homogeneous strain distribution, while chamber diameter has an optimal effect on the homogeneity. Material flow diagram of the deformation zone demonstrated that shear strains have a significant contribution to accumulated effective strain especially adjacent to the outer region of the sample. In comparison, in the central region of the CEE processed sample, normal strains exist as a dominant deformation route.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a system-based {{model for the}} fatigue assessment of old, deteriorating riveted railway bridge connections, which are built up {{of a number of}} basic components. A finite element model of a typical, short-span railway bridge is used to convert train loading into probabilistic fatigue load spectra via Monte Carlo train simulations. Uncertainties in terms of loading, resistance and modelling are taken into account. Fatigue damage calculations are based on the Theory of Critical Distances, which is a recently developed theory that considers the entire stress distribution ahead of any given stress concentration. The paper focuses on a typical riveted stringer-to-cross-girder connection which is treated through generic sub-systems that capture potential damage in identifiable hot-spots, such as rivets, holes and <b>angle</b> <b>fillets.</b> By treating these hot- spots as the elements of a structural system susceptible to fatigue failure, its reliability over time is evaluated using system reliability methods. The results show that the probability of failure of the connection depends significantly on the form of the system adopted for the analysis. Low remaining lives on specific hotspots on different connection components show that fatigue cracking may be imminent or may have already initiated in a number of similar existing bridge connections...|$|R
40|$|Achievement {{of sharp}} bending <b>angles</b> with small <b>fillet</b> radius on {{stainless}} steel sheets by mechanical bending requires sophisticated bending device and troublesome operational procedures, which can involve expensive molds, huge presses and large loads. In addition, springback is always difficult to control, thus often leading to final parts with limited precision and accuracy. In contrast, laser-assisted bending of metals is an emerging technology, as it often allows to perform difficult and multifaceted manufacturing tasks with relatively small efforts. In the present work, laser-assisted bending of {{stainless steel sheets}} to achieve sharp angles is thus investigated. First, bending trials were performed by combining laser irradiation with an auxiliary bending device triggered by a pneumatic actuator and based on kinematic of deformable quadrilaterals. Second, laser operational parameters, that is, scanning speed, power and number of passes, were varied to identify the most suitable processing settings. Bending <b>angles</b> and <b>fillet</b> radii were measured by coordinate measurement machine. Experimental data were elaborated by combined ANalysis Of Mean (ANOM) and ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA).

3000|$|FE {{modelling}} including mesh discretization, boundary conditions, loading method, {{and method}} of static FE analysis using ABAQUS standard of top- and seat-angle connections was discussed elaborately in the author’s previous literatures (Ahmed et al. 2001; Ahmed 2002). In those and other (Pirmoz et al. 2009) research articles, the stress-deformation pattern developed by FE analyses showed that plastic yielding initiated at {{the toe of}} the tension <b>angle’s</b> <b>fillet,</b> followed by yielding in the area under the tension bolt head for thinner angles (e.g., for the cases of 0.7 ex 3 / [...].- 0 pt 0.7 ex 8 ^" [...] angle thickness), and {{in the areas of}} tension bolthole for the cases of thicker angles. Thus, it is noted that as the tension angle thickness increases, the zone of plastic yielding moves toward the centreline of the bolthole of the vertical leg. Shen and Astaneh-Asl (1999) also found similar deformation history of the connections in their experimental programs and observed that plastic deformations were developed in the vertical leg of top-angle and horizontal leg of seat-angle for connections with thinner angles, whereas the plastic deformations were formed at the central line of the column bolts of top-angle’s vertical leg together with shank areas of bolts for relatively thick angles. Simultaneously, FE analysis results showed that the stresses higher than the yield point were generated in the bolt shank near the bolt head. It indicates that the nonlinear behaviour of the connection differs from some assumptions of Kishi–Chen’s power model. With this background, the place of formation of the upper plastic hinge in the top angle’s vertical leg has been revised and an additional plastic hinge is supplied in the tension bolts according to the results of tests (Shen and Astaneh-Asl 1999) and FE analyses (Ahmed et al. 2001; Ahmed 2002; Pirmoz et al. 2009) for the proposed prediction model in determining the ultimate connection moment.|$|R

Considering the time-varying effects of mesh points, mesh force, line-of-action vector, mesh stiffness, transmission error, friction force direction, and friction coefficient, a nonlinear lumped parameter dynamic model was developed for the spiral bevel gear pair. Based on the mesh model and the nonlinear dynamic model, the effects of main geometry parameters on the contact and bending strength were analyzed. Also, the effects on the dynamic mesh force and dynamic transmission error were investigated. Results show that higher value for the pressure <b>angle,</b> root <b>fillet</b> radius, and the ratio of tooth thickness tend to improve the contact and bending strength and {{to reduce the risk}} of tooth fracture. Improved gears have a better vibration performance in the targeted frequency range. Finally, bench tests for both types of spiral bevel gears were performed.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} deals with an external-force laser assisted bending process of Grade 2 CP titanium and AA 7075 T 6 aluminum sheets. High bending <b>angles,</b> sharp <b>fillet</b> radii {{and control of}} springback were achieved by tuning the contact pressure of a hydraulically driven tool with the local and selective heating of the bending zone by irradiation with a high power diode laser. First, the role of laser operational parameters, namely power, scanning speed and number of passes, in metal bending was investigated, allowing to identify the most suitable processing window. Second, a custom-built equipment to measure the bending angle during the forming process, together with the metal temperature, was implemented. Real-time monitoring of the bending angle and temperature allowed to evaluate the continuous evolution of the geometry of the metal substrates during the external force laser-assisted bending process. Experimental results showed both metal sheets could be bent to high angles with very low fillet radii by the appropriate combination of the tooling contact pressure and selective laser heating of the bending zone. Laser heating also {{reduces the risk of}} rupture in both metals during bending at high angles, limits the springback extent up to 10 times on titanium and 30 times on aluminum in comparison with conventional bending process and does not affect significantly the visual appearance of the bending zone. © 2016 Elsevier Lt...|$|R

The stress patterns resulting from different screw geometries and bone densities were analyzed using finite element techniques, taking into account different levels of osseointegration between the screw and the bone. These numerical models where validated through experimental pull-out tests, where a pull out force of 120 N produced localized failure of the last thread (stresses above 0. 42 MPa). The results of the numerical simulations were then summarised using a multi-factorial parametric analysis. This demonstrated the great relevance {{of the interaction between}} bone density and screw pitch, showing that the optimal screw pitch can vary by more than 25 % for different densities (0. 35 g/cm 3 and 0. 47 g/cm 3, respectively). The parameters calculated by means of the multi-factorial analysis allow the pull out force to be estimated for different osseointegration levels, different screw geometries and material properties, and for different bone densities. The final objective is to determine the best choice of implant for each individual patient. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study, we have {{attempted}} to refine a microstructure of conventional AZ 31 magnesium alloy using a new combination process including hot extrusion followed by a cold equal channel angular pressing (ECAP). ECAP die was specially designed with an inner die corner angle of 135 degree, the <b>fillet</b> <b>angle</b> of 45 degree and dimensional thermo-coupled elastro-plastic material model {{in order to understand}} the change of stress and strain of the deformed material after a cold ECAP. ECAP for the AZ 31 alloy, which was extruded in the extrusion ratio 20 to 1 and heat-treated at 623 K, was successfully carried out at room temperature. The uniform shear band obtained from experiment was well matched with the zone of effective strain more than 0. 533 estimated from calculation. On the basis of the results, it is suggested that the room temperature ECAP makes microstructure to be refined and the basal plane to be rotated slightly from extrusion direction to axis direction. Compressive yield strength of AZ 31 alloy can be enhanced up to twice in applying ECAP process. Hall-Petch relations do not fit to the experimental data This can be ascribed to the texture effect. Room temperature ECAP process is very promising in improving mechanical properties of AZ 31 alloy in terms of grain refinement and texture control...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed that allows the use of plate elements instead of numerically inefficient solid elements for modeling structures with 90 degree fillets. The technique uses plate bridges with pseudo Young's modulus (Eb) and thickness (tb) values placed between the tangent points of the fillets. These parameters are obtained by solving two nonlinear simultaneous equations {{in terms of the}} independent variables rlt and twallt. These equations are generated by equating the rotation at the tangent point of a bridge system with that of a fillet, where both rotations are derived using beam theory. Accurate surface fits of the solutions are also presented to provide the user with closed-form equations for the parameters. The methodology was verified on the subcomponent level and with a representative filleted structure, where the technique yielded a plate model exhibiting a level of accuracy better than or equal to a high-fidelity solid model and with a 90 -percent {{reduction in the number of}} DOFs. The application of this method for parametric design studies, optimization, and dynamic analysis should prove extremely beneficial for the finite element practitioner. Although the method does not attempt to produce accurate stresses in the filleted region, it can also be used to obtain stresses elsewhere in the structure for preliminary analysis. A future avenue of study is to extend the theory developed here to other fillet geometries, including <b>fillet</b> <b>angles</b> other than 90 and multifaceted intersections...|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{finite element}} modeling and experimental testing program {{has been carried out}} to determine the most optimum design parameters for solder joints in surface mount applications. Although the analysis and testing (power cycling and thermal cycling) has been carried out for a variety of package styles, particular at-tention will be paid to the result for leadless ceramic chip carriers. This package is particularly useful in certain high performance military and commercial applica-tions. Analysis and experimentation indicate that increased fatigue life under power cycling can be attained by fabricating solder joints with large fillets and low standoff heights. The large fillet geometry significantly reduces harmful stress concentrations while increasing the net cross-sectional area within the joint. Both factors tend to improve the fracture toughness of the joint. The temperature and frequency dependencies of solder joint fatigue life under power cycling testing is discussed. The observed frequency dependence can be minimized by eliminating harmful tensile strain components thus reducing harmful stress relaxation and tensile induced ox-ygen embrittlement of grain boundaries. Temperature cycling studies indicate joints with slightly higher standoffs and low <b>fillet</b> <b>angles</b> are more resistant to cyclic fatigue than pillar type joints which tend to focus shear strains at the interfaces. Solder joints can be tapered to improve overall reliability but, in most cases, tapering will provide only a small increase in fracture toughness of the joint through the elimina-tion of stress concentrations. Additional fatigue life increases can be obtained only through an enlargement of the joint cross-sectional area. Aspects of the above results will be presented in detail along with design guidelines for creating high reliability solder joints for various application scenarios...|$|R

FEDSM-ICNMM 2010 - 30856 There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in understanding the flow behaviour inside diffuser/nozzle elements {{in order to identify}} performance characteristics of these elements for micropump applications. Flat-walled diffuser/nozzle element is the most commonly used type for valveless micropump applications due to its ease of fabrication and compact design. In this paper, we study generic flat-walled diffuser/nozzle elements and apply optimization techniques to explore how the pumping efficiency can be improved by changing geometry to provide higher rectification efficiency and lower pressure drop in rectification valveless micropumps. The primary motivation for this study is to evaluate the performance of flat-walled diffuser/nozzle elements based on geometry variations under several Reynolds numbers (Re). In this study we employ a design methodology for diffuser/nozzle elements that incorporates computational fluid dynamics (CFD) within an optimization methodology. To start the process a series of geometric parameters are selected including element neck width, depth, divergence <b>angle,</b> and entrance <b>fillet</b> radius. Then, the pressure drop and rectification property of an element are calculated as performance parameters, i. e., by varying the geometry it is desirable to maximise pressure rise and the rectification property of the element. Design of experiments (DOE) is employed to generate the experimental table which corresponds to different geometries representing the design space. These limited numbers of geometries generated by DOE are evaluated by using CFD to obtain corresponding performance parameters. By preparing all the design and performance parameters, Surrogate model (SM) technique is applied to obtain the relationship (approximation function) between design and performance parameters. Eventually, based on the developed approximation functions or response surfaces, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is employed to maximise pressure rise and rectification property of diffuser/nozzle element. This design methodology is a very powerful tool to design and optimise flat-walled diffuser/nozzle elements for micropump applications and can speed up the micropump design process significantly...|$|R
