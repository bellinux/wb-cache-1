40|$|The {{ethyl acetate}} {{synthesis}} via heterogeneous reactive distillation is studied experimentally using ethanol and acetic acid. Three types of cation exchanging resins {{were used as}} catalysts: Zerolit 225, Zerolit 226 and Ambylite 400. Experiments were carried out in two units of the same dimensions. Each unit consisted of three sections: rectifying, reactive and stripping sections of heights (60 + 25 + 20) cm respectively and 2. 5 cm column diameter. The first unit (column-A-) was a fractionation type and the second unit (column-B-) was packed column. The packing type was hollow glass cylinders with 10 mm height, and 4, 5 mm inner and outer diameter respectively. The experiments were carried out by using two operation modes. The semi-batch and continuous operation mode. In {{the first part of}} present investigation, the semi-batch mode was used to evaluate the catalyst type and to evaluate the performance of reactive distillation unit configuration (Fractionation and packed column). Results show that, the column-B- gave higher conversion rates than column-A-. This is attributed to the high surface area available for liquid vapour contact in packed type column, which leads to increasing mass transfer rates. On the other hand, Ambylite 400 catalyst showed higher activity for esterification reaction than other two types of catalysts. The second part of work continued with column -B- only. It is well known that, the esterification process is regarded one of exothermic reactions. Therefore, the monitoring of the temperature distribution along column <b>axial</b> <b>for</b> all three types of catalysts showed that the temperature distribution was essentially the same due to steady state operation in continuous operation mode.

40|$|The {{investigations}} {{carried out}} in this thesis involved the nanoscale characterization of isolated ferromagnetic nanowires (NWs) using off-axis electron holography (EH), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The research focused on two categories of NWs, single phase CoFeB NWs and multilayer CoFeB/Cu NWs, which were fabricated by pulsed-current electrodeposition in nanoporous alumina membranes as an array of NWs. EH has been used to investigate the local magnetic behavior of the isolated NWs in their remanent state. In addition, the uniformity in diameter, composition, crystal structure of individual NWs were investigated. Single phase CoFeB ferromagnetic NWs, with diameters ranging between 20 to 170 nm, were studied. Electron diffraction patterns indicated that the NWs were nanocrystalline, BCC CoFeB, with grain sizes up to 20 nm × 20 nm. Holograms from EH showed that the magnetization inside the NWs was uniform over most of their length, except at their edges. Since the NWs consisted of soft magnetic nanocrystals, the magnetic anisotropy was likely dominated by the shape anisotropy. Numerical simulations suggested that the stray field at the tips of the NWs was well reproduced by a truncated cone model, rather than a cylinder. The average magnetic induction was 1. 4 ± 0. 3 T. Multilayer NWs consisted of periodic magnetic layers of CoFeB alloys and non-magnetic layers of Cu. Individual NW compositions, crystallinity, and layer thicknesses were calibrated using scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. These properties were found to be significantly different from their expected nominal values assumed for the arrays, based on single-phase growth rates. Diffraction patterns obtained from the NWs again showed that both the CoFeB and Cu layers were nanocrystalline (BCC CoFeB, FCC Cu) but that the CoFeB layers had a significant atomic fraction of Cu, despite the small concentration of Cu used in the electrolyte. Nevertheless, the average magnetic induction of individual CoFeB layers ranged between 0. 5 and 1. 5 T, depending upon the thickness of the layer, from 50 nm to 250 nm, and the direction of an external magnetic field applied in situ. The magnetization was <b>axial</b> <b>for</b> all external field directions when the CoFeB layer was thicker than the diameter (45 nm), while for thin CoFeB and Cu layers (< 10 nm), magnetic vortices were detected, associated with opposing magnetization in neighbouring layers.

40|$|Despite the turbomachines {{are used}} in space {{propulsion}} since the beginning, they still represent crucial components for liquid-propelled rockets. The complexity of these devices requires to {{pay particular attention to}} their design behavior, especially in presence of cavitation. Indeed turbomachines are usually asked to work with a two-phase flow which can affect not only the pumping performance, but can also generate peculiar flow instabilities closely connected with the cavitation and whose amplitude depend on the cavitation level. Cavitation is at the basis {{of one of the most}} important technical problems faced in rockets powered by turbomachines: the arising of the POGO phenomenon. This phenomenon has been known since the dawn of the space missions and it consists of a resonance where the dynamics of the longitudinal vibrations of the rocket structure can couple with the thrust oscillations eventually leading to mission failure. The POGO oscillations are very related to the presence of cavitation which can alter the dynamic response of the turbomachines to pressure and flow rate oscillations generated in the ducts by flow/combustion instabilities or other types of instabilities. In this thesis the changes brought to the test facility at Alta S. p. A. in order to adapt the test rig to the experimentation of the POGO phenomenon will be shown. The innovative system for the generation of the oscillations is based on the vertical vibration of the tank so that pressure oscillations are produced and, thanks to the impedance of the discharge and suction lines, also flow rate oscillations are consequently generated. These oscillations are assessed by means of piezoelectric pressure transducers placed along the lines whose readings have been used for evaluating the dynamic transfer matrix for different pumps. In particular three different pumps have been tested: two inducers and a centrifugal pump. Both the inducers have been derived from the DAPAMITO inducers family whose design has been drawn by means of the model developed by Professor d’Agostino. The new inducers have been modified in the leading edge shape, whose tip shape has been rounded in order to study its effect on the performance and on flow instabilities, which are notoriously affected by the shape of the leading edge. The experimental study of these machines outlined weak effects of the leading edge shape on the non-cavitating performance, but greater effect has been noticed on the suction performance which shows an early head degradation. The analysis of the flow instabilities has also shown the effect of the shape of this important part which can affect the presence of some forms of instabilities. Indeed a comparison with the previous inducers and a later one with sharp edges confirmed the effect of this part on the flow instabilities, some of which, like the high-order surge, can disappear with the rounding of the leading edge. Anyway a deeper analysis of the cavitation effects should be carried out given the relatively high values of cavitation numbers tested. This should be performed in order to verify if some phenomena (especially the some rotating instabilities) could arise at lower cavitation numbers thus showing a delaying effect of the rounded leading edge on the flow instabilities. The study of the flow instabilities on the centrifugal pumps outlined instead the need in the next future to make some changes to the test rig so that the pressure taps can be placed nearer to the pump. Indeed in the actual configuration, because of the distance of the pressure taps, some possible rotating instabilities have been detected as <b>axial.</b> <b>For</b> the characterization of the dynamic response of the considered pumps the test facility has been modified on the basis of a model previously developed. The model outlined the need to have two different configurations which could give the possibility to perform distinct tests and so to get the dynamic matrix of the pumps. A first test campaign has been performed and it outlined many different problematics which demonstrated to be of crucial importance for the successof the experiment. Among the different problems there have been detected: excessive vibrations of the suction and discharge lines which have been almost completely eliminated by using reinforced concrete plynths to block the two pipes beside the tank; too many air pockets in the water have been detected and the number of the dearinting cycles have been so increased; some differences in the sensitivity of the pressure transducers have been found and so a specific calibration has been performed in order to find a way to properly correct the sensitivity at varying the frequency and the pressure amplitude in sucha a way that all the transducer would have given the same result for the same input. A second experimental campaign for the dynamic matrix characterization has been performed only on two test items: the three bladed inducer and the centrifugal pump. This experimental campaign, anyway, hasn’t brought the expected results. The vibrating table proved to be able to generate significant pressure oscillations, but the trend of the dynamic matrix elements showed to be very different from the one foreseen by the model or by the few previous experimental results reported in literature. Some models have been also developed and presented in this thesis in order to understand the results obtained. Their capabilities have been compared by fitting the experimentala data available in literature. Each proposed model shows a different complexity in describing the physics involved in turbomachines, but the model which best fits the experimental data has been the one already used in the design of the experiment. So this model has been used in order to better characterize the dynamics of the whole circuit on the basis of the experimental data recorded during the second experimental campaign and it gives the possibility to get the component of the dynamic matrix by fitting the data related to the pressure oscillations at the pump inlet. This model of the circuit has also allowed to assess the very high condition number of the problem and it has highlighted how much some errors on the measurements can influence the assessment of the dynamic matrix. In particular it has been noticed that an error on the evaluation of the amplitude of the pressure oscillations had minor effects than the errors on the determination of their phases which resulted to totally change the trend of the dynamic matrix components at vearying the frequency of the imposed oscillation. The same model has been also used to identify some configurations which can give different geometrically independent configurations by only changing the position or the value of a compliance, which is physically represented by an hydraulic accumulator. In this way different experiments can be performed for the same imposed oscillating frequency and it is so allowed the possibility to reduce the effect of measurement errors on the transfer matrix assessment. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to the study of another very important problem: the rotordynamic forces acting on turbomachines, especially in the presence of cavitation. The experimental activity has concerned an inducer, similar to those previously tested, a centrifugal pump and their combination. In this thesis, anyway, it is reported only the work performed on the inducer. The effects of the flow coefficient, the intensity of the cavitation and of the temperature on the forces is shown. In the tests it came out that the inducer is weakly affected by the intensity of the cavitation until this becomes such intense to lead the pump head to drop. In this case the force acting on the pump can vary significantly in intensity and also in behavior. The effect of the temperature has been instead almost negligible for all the tested conditions whereas the incidence angle showed some interesting effects on the disposition and the values of the maxima and minima of the rotordynamic force...|$|E
