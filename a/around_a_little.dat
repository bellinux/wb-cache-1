5|$|It was {{announced}} on 11 October 2014 that {{in partnership with}} Saban Brands, Cirque du Soleil Media would produce an animated children's (pre-school aged) series called Luna Petunia and the showrunner {{was announced}} as children's TV writer Bradley Zweig. The plot revolves <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl who plays in a dreamland where she learns {{how to make the}} impossible possible. It began airing on Netflix in September 2016.|$|E
500|$|A {{common problem}} with the scripts, {{according}} to Novak, is {{that they tend to}} run too long for the regular 22-minute time slot, leading to several cuts. For example, the script for the episode [...] "Search Committee" [...] was initially 75 pages—10 pages too long. A complete script is written for each episode; however, actors are given opportunities to improvise during the shooting process. Fischer said, [...] "Our shows are 100 percent scripted. They put everything down on paper. But we get to play <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit, too. Steve and Rainn are brilliant improvisers." [...] This leads to a large number of deleted scenes with almost every episode of The Office, all of which are considered part of the show's canon and storyline by Daniels. Deleted scenes have sometimes been restored in repeats to make episodes longer or draw back people who have seen the episode before to see the bonus footage. In an experiment, a deleted scene from [...] "The Return" [...] was made available over NBC.com and iTunes, explaining the absence of a character over the next several episodes. Daniels hoped that word of mouth among fans would spread the information, but eventually considered the experiment a failure.|$|E
2500|$|Miller birdied {{the first}} four holes and hit all 18 greens in regulation. He got five more birdies with only one bogey (a 3-putt on the 244yard par-3 #8), and needed only 29 putts during the round. Ten of his {{approach}} shots finished within 10 feet of the cup. In 2007, Miller said: [...] "It was the greatest ball-striking round I've ever seen and I've been <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit." ...|$|E
60|$|Dredlinton {{stared at}} the closed door. Then he turned <b>around</b> with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gesture of anger.|$|R
60|$|He heard footsteps, {{and looking}} <b>around</b> was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{surprised}} to see Batley moving toward him.|$|R
60|$|A {{declaration}} of war, courteously veiled but decisive. Laverick looked <b>around</b> him <b>a</b> <b>little</b> defiantly, and shrugged his shoulders.|$|R
2500|$|The episode {{introduced}} a [...] "Then and Now" [...] structure, which utilizes flashbacks that bookend the episode; flashbacks {{were used in}} previous seasons of the television series, and were sparsely used in the graphic novels the series is based on. Although Gimple stated that this feature would not be seen throughout the season, he said, [...] "We definitely play with time this season. And we’ll be jumping <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit, but I believe this is our only Then and Now." [...] Kirkman noted that the audience [...] " [...] so much more about Gareth {{and all of those}} people because of those two very minor scenes." [...] Gimple knew the backstory of Terminus while the characters were traveling there in the previous season, and stated that it echoes what happens next to Rick's group. The writers wanted to divulge and formulate the [...] "whole story" [...] of Terminus that affects the characters of the show; he related the stories of everyone in their universe to [...] "walking ghosts of Christmas Future and ghosts of Christmas Past to [...] characters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the album's stripped-back closing track, [...] "You Were Good", Jim Adkins stated: [...] "A {{fair amount}} of the ideas for Damage started out as {{acoustic}} songs, like really rough acoustic songs. 'You Were Good' started out in a pretty acoustic-based world and {{when we tried to}} take it out of that world, we realized that without the acoustic guitar in there as a bed, it didn't feel the same without it being there. With 'You Were Good', we experimented <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit with fleshing it out and building the dynamics of it in a full band sense, {{but at the end of}} the day we all looked at each other and agreed it sounded better with just me and a guitar and the weirdo, Indian drone thing on there." [...] Guitarist and backing vocalist Tom Linton elaborated: [...] "It was just [...] with an acoustic guitar and his vocals, and there was never a point where he stopped and started over. He just played it from the beginning to the end live. Then I overdubbed an organ part and Alain [...] played the guitar part. That was really fun to do, and I don't think we had ever done it before, especially with vocals." ...|$|E
60|$|The man ceased his task. He looked <b>around,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bewildered.|$|E
50|$|Lickleyhead Castle is a well-restored L-plan castle, {{dating from}} <b>around</b> 1600, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> south of Auchleven, by {{the banks of}} the Gadie Burn, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.|$|R
60|$|Betsy {{followed}} {{and from the}} eminence looked <b>around</b> her. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> way off stood a splendid big greenhouse, its thousands of crystal panes glittering in the sunlight.|$|R
60|$|At Trewly's their {{entrance}} {{produced a}} mild sensation. Their usual table was fortunately unoccupied. The manager himself welcomed them with many compliments. Marcia glanced <b>around</b> her <b>a</b> <b>little</b> listlessly.|$|R
60|$|He glanced <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> helplessly. Quest took a cigar {{from his}} case, and lit it.|$|E
60|$|For reply Peck {{got up on}} his feet. At {{first he}} swayed <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> but {{presently}} steadied himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{better look}} <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> first and make sure," [...] he reasoned. [...] "If I can only {{find some of}} the gold Mr. Harrison spoke about, I'd be sure." ...|$|E
60|$|The Professor {{could do}} nothing but look <b>around</b> him <b>a</b> <b>little</b> vaguely. Together {{they went back to}} the house and searched it without result. Then they {{returned}} once more to the garage.|$|R
60|$|Granet calmly flashed his own {{electric}} torch. There were {{at least}} a dozen soldiers standing <b>around,</b> and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> company were hurrying down from the gates. He switched off his light almost immediately.|$|R
60|$|Jack Belllounds admiringly {{walked all}} <b>around</b> the mustang <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{too close to}} please Spottie.|$|R
60|$|The {{children}} are all right. They paddle <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> and drive-so do we all. Lucerne {{seems to be}} pretty full of tourists. The Fleulen boat went out crowded yesterday morning.|$|E
60|$|They {{adjusted}} the new sweep with care {{and pulled on}} it gradually. At first the houseboat refused to budge, but presently it swung <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> and then more and more.|$|E
60|$|A {{clatter of}} blocks broke {{out and the}} upper half of the tall {{mainsail}} suddenly collapsed. Then the schooner's bows swung <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> until they pointed to the seething froth upon the opposite beach.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't care {{to live in}} it," [...] {{said the}} Texan. [...] "Your son and I knocked <b>around</b> quite <b>a</b> <b>little</b> last night. You've got good water, but Cactus City is better lit up." ...|$|R
60|$|Then Dot stopped {{suddenly}} and looked <b>around.</b> <b>A</b> cozy <b>little</b> vine-covered cottage nearly surrounded by blooming posies, was before her. From the doorway, however, a path led to Dot's feet, {{and sitting in}} the middle of this path, slowly piling pebbles into his broad-brimmed straw hat, was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boy.|$|R
60|$|She turned {{abruptly}} <b>around.</b> She made <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{motion as}} of dismissal, but I remained by her side.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, he's {{growling}} <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> but that's all," [...] {{answered the}} young major. [...] "I'm not {{paying any attention}} to him, Ruth. I'm mighty glad that you didn't accept his invitation," [...] and {{he gave her a}} warm glance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that forces}} {{me out of}} {{business}} for the time being, Ogilvie. I'll have to look <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{and see if it}} is worth while for me to take hold elsewhere. I presume all the really good claims around here have been covered." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{ten minutes}} later when they sat <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> table in the back store, which smelt unpleasantly of salt pork and coffee. A big {{kerosene}} lamp hung above their heads, and the storekeeper gazed with almost incredulous eyes at the litter of broken stones in front of him.|$|E

60|$|I didn't say anything, {{but in a}} {{few minutes}} I made another dive. I {{determined}} to look <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> this time, and seize something that I could break off or pull up. I found that I couldn't stay under water, like the darkeys could. That required practice, and perhaps more fishy lungs.|$|E
60|$|The {{remainder}} of the night passed without anything unusual happening. Once the wind veered <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> threatening to suffocate them with smoke from the camp-fire, {{but by the time}} they prepared to vacate the shelter the wind veered back to where it had first come from and gave them no more trouble.|$|E
60|$|Now {{he fixed}} {{his eyes on}} Washington as an actuality.
