5|$|Another habit {{the moth}} has {{in common with}} many {{butterflies}} is the night resting posture—the wings are held vertically over the back. During their migrations they roost in a group for the night. The moth flies over the crown of trees and in clearings. Sometimes because of high winds it is carried about 100m (300ft), it then falls, inert <b>and</b> <b>wings</b> closed, to the ground.|$|E

50|$|Other {{types of}} BCD exist which more {{resemble}} backplate <b>and</b> <b>wing</b> BCD. Back-inflation BCDs {{are similar in}} construction to jacket BCDs, except for where the buoyancy cell is. In a back-inflation BCD, as with a backplate <b>and</b> <b>wing,</b> the cell is behind the diver’s back, and is of similar shape to a wing, but a back-inflation BCD usually {{does not have the}} modularity of a backplate <b>and</b> <b>wing,</b> although some models let buoyancy cells be substituted.|$|R
5|$|C. f. funereus, the {{nominate}} form, {{is known}} as the eastern yellow-tailed black cockatoo. It is found from Berserker Range in central Queensland, south through New South Wales, and into eastern Victoria. It is distinguished by its overall larger size, longer tail <b>and</b> <b>wings,</b> and larger bill and claws.|$|E
5|$|Many {{researchers}} consider {{there to}} be at least two species of Pteranodon. However, aside from the differences between males and females described above, the post-cranial skeletons of Pteranodon show little to no variation between species or specimens, and the bodies <b>and</b> <b>wings</b> of all pteranodonts were essentially identical.|$|E

5|$|Pupa: The pupae in {{most species}} are adecticous (with no {{functional}} mandibles in the pupal state) and obtect (with appendages fused or {{glued to the}} body), while others are decticous (with functional mandibles present in the pupal state) and exarate (having the antennae, legs, <b>and</b> <b>wings</b> free).|$|E

5|$|The {{nuthatch}}es are {{a family}} of similar-looking birds with short tails <b>and</b> <b>wings,</b> compact bodies and longish pointed bills. They have grey or bluish upperparts, a black eyestripe and strong feet. All are in the single genus Sitta. Within the genus, the Eurasian nuthatch forms a superspecies with the chestnut-vented, Indian, chestnut-bellied and Kashmir nuthatches and {{has in the past}} been considered conspecific with all of these.|$|E

5|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturæ in 1758 as Turdus polyglottos. The northern mockingbird {{is known for}} its mimicking ability, as reflected by the meaning of its scientific name, 'many-tongued mimic.' The northern mockingbird has gray to brown upper feathers and a paler belly. Its tail <b>and</b> <b>wings</b> have white patches which are visible in flight.|$|E
5|$|Crickets are hemimetabolic insects, whose {{lifecycle}} {{consists of}} an egg stage, a larval or nymph stage that increasingly resembles the adult form as the nymph grows, and an adult stage. The egg hatches into a nymph {{about the size of}} a fruit fly. This passes through about 10 larval stages, and with each successive moult, it becomes more like an adult. After the final moult, the genitalia <b>and</b> <b>wings</b> are fully developed, but a period of maturation is needed before the cricket is ready to breed.|$|E
5|$|Fossil caddisflies {{have been}} found in rocks dating back to the Triassic. The largest numbers of fossilised remains are those of larval cases, which are made of durable {{materials}} that preserve well. Body fossils of caddisflies are extremely rare, the oldest being from the Early and Middle Triassic, some 230 million years ago, <b>and</b> <b>wings</b> are another source of fossils. The evolution of the group to one with fully aquatic larvae seems to have taken place some time during the Triassic. The finding of fossils resembling caddisfly larval cases in marine deposits in Brazil may push back the origins of the order to the early Permian period.|$|E

5|$|Scaly-breasted munias form {{flocks of}} as many as 100 birds. Individuals {{communicate}} with calls that include a short whistle, variations of kitty-kitty-kitty, and a sharp chipping alarm note. They sometimes flick their tails <b>and</b> <b>wings</b> vertically or horizontally while hopping about. The tail flicking motion may have evolved from a locomotory intention movement. The exaggerated version of the tail flicking movement may have undergone ritualization. As a social signal, tail flicking in several other species acts as a signal indicating the intent to fly and helps keep flocks together.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics YF-22 was an American single-seat, {{twin-engine}} fighter aircraft {{technology demonstrator}} {{designed for the}} United States Air Force (USAF). The design was a finalist in the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter competition, and two prototypes were built for the demonstration/validation phase of the competition. The YF-22 won the contest against the Northrop YF-23, and entered production as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. The YF-22 has similar aerodynamic layout and configuration as the F-22, but with differences in the position and design of the cockpit, tail fins <b>and</b> <b>wings,</b> and in internal structural layout.|$|E
5|$|The Siberian accentor has brown upperparts <b>and</b> <b>wings,</b> {{with bright}} {{chestnut}} streaking {{on its back}} and a greyish-brown rump and tail. The head has a dark brown crown and a long, wide pale yellow supercilium ("eyebrow"). All plumages are quite similar. The nest is an open cup in dense shrub or a tree into which the female lays four to six glossy deep blue-green eggs that hatch in about ten days. Adults and chicks feed mainly on insects, typically picked off the ground, but sometimes taken from vegetation. In winter, the accentors may also consume seeds or feed near human habitation.|$|E
