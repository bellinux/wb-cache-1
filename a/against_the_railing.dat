5|$|The {{majority}} of the guns were small iron guns with short range that could be aimed and fired by a single person. The two most common are the bases, breech-loading swivel guns, most likely placed in the castles, and hailshot pieces, small muzzle-loaders with rectangular bores and fin-like protrusions {{that were used to}} support the guns <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> and allow the ship structure to take the force of the recoil. Though the design is unknown, there were two top pieces in a 1546 inventory (finished after the sinking) which was probably similar to a base, but placed in {{one or more of the}} fighting tops.|$|E
25|$|The {{octagonal}} timber bandstand sits on timber stumps {{and has a}} {{corrugated iron}} pitched roof with a central metal finial. The building features decorative timber brackets and valance with a perimeter seat <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing.</b> Access is via timber stairs {{to the north and}} the ceiling has plywood sheeting with timber cover strips.|$|E
500|$|A gifted, slick-fielding {{defensive}} first baseman, in 3 of {{his first}} 21 games he made spectacular catches of foul pop-ups, bracing himself <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> {{in front of the}} first base dugout, and then flipping over the railing as he caught the ball. [...] The [...] Davis said: [...] "I'm going to try to catch any ball I can. I've got long arms, I guess. [...] I'd rather end the game, than worry about getting a bruise." ...|$|E
60|$|Bessie (Sobs, {{drooping}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings).</b> No! No! I don't. I don't {{hear him}} any more.|$|R
60|$|Chatteris {{was leaning}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings.</b> He started violently at Melville's hand upon his shoulder. They made awkward greetings.|$|R
60|$|Drexley pointed downwards. The slouching figure {{which they}} had been {{watching}} had half collapsed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings.</b> He was obviously overpowered with drink.|$|R
500|$|He {{heads to}} her house, which is eerily quiet. Going in, he discovers {{a bottle of}} whiskey, several {{cigarette}} butts, and a telegram from the government. Dorothy's husband is dead, his plane shot down over France. Dorothy comes out of her bedroom, crying, and Hermie tells her [...] "I'm sorry." [...] The sense of empathy triggers her to channel to Hermie some of her loneliness. She turns on the record player and invites Hermie to dance with her. They kiss and embrace, tears on both their faces. Without speaking, and to the sound only of the waves, they move to the bedroom, where she draws him into bed and gently makes love with him. Afterward, withdrawing again into her world of hurt, Dorothy retires to the porch, leaving Hermie alone in her bedroom. He approaches her on the porch, where she can only quietly say [...] "Good night, Hermie." [...] He leaves, his last image of Dorothy being of her leaning <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing,</b> as she smokes a cigarette and stares into the night sky.|$|E
60|$|Blake made {{a sudden}} movement, and then leaned back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing.</b>|$|E
60|$|I placed myself {{sideways}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> of the verandah--first ascertaining, {{by touching}} them, {{the position of}} the flower-pots on either side of me. There was room enough for me to sit between them and no more. The sweet-scented leaves of the flower on my left hand just brushed my cheek as I lightly rested my head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing.</b>|$|E
60|$|Once I looked round {{through an}} opening in the laurel leaves. The {{stranger}} was leaning wearily <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings</b> round <b>the</b> lodge, waiting for admittance.|$|R
60|$|Instead of blazing into a fury, as I had expected, {{the general}} gave a long whistle of astonishment, and then leant up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings,</b> {{laughing}} softly to himself.|$|R
60|$|Charles {{examined}} it close, stopping short <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings</b> in St. James's Square {{to look at}} it with his pocket-lens. There was no denying the truth. It was a capital small gem of the finest quality.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a scuffle}} near the stairs, and both boys fell up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{about the}} bicycle?' I asked; for it lay, a silent victor, <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> of the steps, {{surrounded}} by a crowd of inquiring Teutons.|$|E
60|$|He {{left her}} {{without waiting for}} a reply, and, {{returning}} with a rug, placed her chair in a sheltered spot; then he leaned <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing.</b>|$|E
60|$|We {{passed through}} {{it on our}} return. Its work for the day was finished, its strange, weary song {{uninterrupted}} by the mighty waggons thundering up and down its spiral way. Hal paused, leaning <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings</b> that encircled its centre, and listened.|$|R
60|$|So {{there he}} remained. At {{a quarter to}} twelve {{children}} and idlers began to gather <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings</b> of Havill's house. A few minutes past twelve the noise of an arriving host was heard {{at the entrance to}} the town. Thereupon Dare and Havill went to the window.|$|R
60|$|Burning with shame, {{trembling}} with anxiety, covered with dust and considerably bruised, Barret sprang up, left his fallen steed, and, raising the {{little old lady}} with great tenderness in his arms, sat her on the pavement with her back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings,</b> while he poured out abject apologies and earnest inquiries.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} in the African forest," [...] Maxwell replied simply, as though that were {{sufficient}} explanation. [...] "Thank you, but I would rather lean <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> here." ...|$|E
60|$|Wiping the {{perspiration}} from my face, I {{made my way}} to {{the forward}} deck. But few people were on board, and quite undisturbed, I leaned <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> to review the situation.|$|E
6000|$|Bernard {{looked out}} of the window too. Angela was leaning <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> of the balcony, in profile, just as she had stood while he painted her, against the {{polished}} parapet at Siena. The young man's eyes rested on her a moment, then, as he glanced back at her mother: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon me," [...] he said, {{jumping up}} in his seat like a monkey on a stick, [...] "there were not two men talking outside the Square gates. According to the {{testimony}} of James Funnell, the constable, two men were leaning arm in arm <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings</b> and one man was talking." ...|$|R
6000|$|X marched up resolute, {{with one}} Berlin glove {{stuck in his}} belt-side, and Jeames simply pointed with his index finger to the {{individual}} who was laughing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings.</b> Not one single word more than [...] "Pleaceman" [...] did he say, but {{stood there in the}} calm summer evening, pointing calmly: a grand sight.|$|R
6000|$|... "At last it {{was another}} policeman, F 22, who, turning into Park Square West from the north side, almost {{stumbled}} upon {{the body of a}} man lying on the pavement with his head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings</b> of <b>the</b> Square. By this time quite a little crowd of people from the different houses in the road had come down, curious to know what had actually happened.|$|R
60|$|A quiet afternoon--not {{a breath}} {{up in the}} churchyard! I was there quite {{half an hour before}} they came. Some red cows had strayed into the {{adjoining}} orchard, and were rubbing their heads <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing.</b> While I stood there an old woman came and drove them away; afterwards, she stooped and picked up the apples that had fallen before their time.|$|E
60|$|On a seat <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> was a {{young woman}} dressed {{suitable}} for red automobiles, with hair the colour of an unsmoked meerschaum. In passing by, Tobin kicks her foot without intentions, and, being polite to ladies when in drink, he tries to give his hat a twist while apologising. But he knocks it off, and the wind carries it overboard.|$|E
6000|$|... "That snow-peak is Wolftooth, {{and thirty}} miles from here, {{and at the}} head of my 'beat,'" [...] said the ranger, after a pause, as they leaned <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> and looked away to the south. [...] "I go up that ridge which you see faintly at the left of the main canon, and through that deep notch which is above timber-line." ...|$|E
60|$|And the {{behavior}} of those present seemed to justify his confidence. The proprietor of the Hotel Mathis regarded him without a smile. The proprietor of the Hotel Previtali might have been in a trance, for all the interest he displayed. The hotel employees continued their tasks impassively. The children were blind and dumb. The cat across the way stropped its backbone <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings</b> unheeding.|$|R
6000|$|... "Close on Ashley's heels now, Hatherell too {{cuts across}} the Square, and reaches the further gate {{in good time}} to give his confederate a hand in {{disposing}} <b>the</b> body <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings.</b> Then, without another instant's delay, Ashley runs back across the gardens, straight to the Ashton Club, throwing away the keys of the dead man, on the very spot where he had {{made it a point}} of being seen and heard by a passer-by.|$|R
60|$|So the {{marriage}} party {{drove up to}} the palace: the dignitaries got out of their carriages and stood aside: poor Rosalba stepped out of her coach, supported by Bulbo, and stood almost fainting up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings</b> so as to have a last look of her dear Giglio. As for Blackstick, she, according to her custom, had flown out of the coach window in some inscrutable manner, and was now standing at the palace door.|$|R
60|$|Having started thus, {{they found}} no {{difficulty}} in agreeing on many points. When Pierston went downstairs from that assembly at a quarter to one, and passed under the steaming nostrils of an ambassador's horses to a hansom which waited for him <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> of the square, he had an impression that the Beloved had re-emerged from the shadows, without any hint or initiative from him--to whom, indeed, such re-emergence was an unquestionably awkward thing.|$|E
60|$|As {{we walked}} rapidly down Howe Street I {{glanced back at}} the {{building}} which we had left. There, dimly outlined at the top window, I could see the shadow of a head, a woman's head, gazing tensely, rigidly, out into the night, waiting with breathless suspense for the renewal of that interrupted message. At the doorway of the Howe Street flats a man, muffled in a cravat and greatcoat, was leaning <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing.</b> He started as the hall-light fell upon our faces.|$|E
60|$|Put yourself, I beseech you, {{into the}} body of that patriot. There he was, friendless and helpless; a man in the very flower of life, for he is not yet forty; with long years of {{happiness}} before him; and now condemned, in one moment, to a cruel and revolting death by dynamite! The square, he said, went round him like a thaumatrope; he saw the Alhambra leap into the air like a balloon; and reeled <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railing.</b> It is probable he fainted.|$|E
60|$|The young bridge tender {{caught the}} blow on the arm, {{and the next}} moment had Percy jammed up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> iron <b>railing</b> to one side.|$|R
60|$|Under one {{of these}} he took his stand, {{squeezing}} himself <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings,</b> and watched <b>the</b> glowing house that was opposite, from which came the sounds of music, of dancing feet, of laughter and the tinkling of glasses. It had balconies, and on these appeared people dressed {{in all sorts of}} costumes. Among them he tried to recognise Isobel, but could not. Either she did not come or he was too far off to see her.|$|R
60|$|So we leaned <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>railings</b> in <b>the</b> warm {{twilight}} haze {{while the}} battalion, silently as a shadow, formed up behind us {{ready to be}} taken over. The heat, {{the hum of the}} great city, as {{it might have been the}} hum of a camped army, the creaking of the belts, and the well-known faces bent above them, brought back to me the memory of another evening, years ago, when Verschoyle and I waited for news of guns missing in no sham fight.|$|R
