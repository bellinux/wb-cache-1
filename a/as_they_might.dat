5|$|In 1990, Will Robinson and Ken Swartz {{produced}} the documentary Port Chicago MutinyA National Tragedy, about the explosion and trial. They interviewed mutiny convict Joe Small, his defense lawyer Gerald Veltmann, {{as well as}} Percy Robinson, a seaman who returned to loading ammunition after the first work-stoppage, and Robert Routh, Jr., a seaman who was blinded in the blast. Danny Glover provided narration for the story, which included dramatized scenes depicting events <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have occurred in 1944. The documentary was nominated for the Peabody Awards and won an Emmy.|$|E
5|$|The gardens {{behind the}} house may {{originally}} have resembled the gardens at Bodysgallen Hall, which were {{laid out in the}} Renaissance style popular across Europe. The slope of the land results in Plas Mawr's gardens forming the upper and lower terraces, and these have been replanted and restored in an attempt to show them <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have appeared in 1665. The summerhouse is based on a version shown in a contemporary painting of Llanerch's gardens, and the flowerpots are modeled on those found in excavations at Tredegar House.|$|E
5|$|Cadw {{carried out}} a major {{restoration}} project on the house over the next 42 months, combining large scale conservation with detailed surveying and archaeological analysis. The 19th-century Victoria Galley was demolished in 1995, and the bare, external stonework was re-rendered and lime washed. Large parts of the property were restored <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have appeared in 1665, assisted by the record of Robert Wynn the younger's will, {{with the exception of}} the attic, which was restored to its probable 19th-century appearance. The intention of this was to emphasize the colour and comfort of the original building, to prevent it appearing inauthentically bleak and austere. Other sections of the house were redeveloped to hold exhibition displays and other visitor facilities.|$|E
60|$|Then Eric {{called for}} men to follow him, and many answered, {{creeping}} <b>as</b> best <b>they</b> <b>might</b> to where he stood.|$|R
60|$|He {{had half}} {{a mind to}} run off and leave the balloon men to find their {{property}} <b>as</b> best <b>they</b> <b>might.</b>|$|R

5|$|Kenney {{read this}} Ultra {{intelligence}} {{in the office of}} the Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area – General Douglas MacArthur – on 25 February. The prospect of an additional 6,900 Japanese troops in the Lae area greatly disturbed MacArthur, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> seriously affect his plans to capture and develop the area. Kenney wrote out orders, which were sent by courier, for Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead, the deputy commander of the Fifth Air Force, and the commander of its Advance Echelon (ADVON) in New Guinea. Under the Fifth Air Force’s unusual command arrangements, Whitehead controlled the Allied Air Forces units of all types in New Guinea. This included the RAAF units there, which were grouped as No. 9 Operational Group RAAF, under the command of Air Commodore Joe Hewitt.|$|E
5|$|The Christian Scientists came in. Before {{they sat}} down, they stood on chairs {{and closed the}} transoms over the two doors to the rooms. Then they made their demand: the series must not be published. S.S. scowled at them and said nothing. To fill the silence, Brynner began rather nervously to assure the Scientists that the {{articles}} were not sensational, not offensive; {{that there was no}} cause for apprehension; that all the facts had been most carefully verified.One of the Scientists cut in to suggest that perhaps there would be no objection to publication of the material if the Scientists were permitted to edit it <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> please.|$|E
5|$|The republican {{government}} had been attempting to remove suspect generals from their posts, and so Franco was relieved {{as chief of}} staff and transferred to command of the Canary islands. Goded was replaced as Inspector General and made general of the Balearic islands; Emilio Mola was moved from head of the Army of Africa to be military commander of Pamplona in Navarre. However, this allowed Mola to direct the mainland uprising, although the relationship between him and Carlist leaders was problematic. General José Sanjurjo became the figurehead of the operation, and helped to come to an agreement with the Carlists. Mola was chief planner and second in command. José Antonio Primo de Rivera was put in prison in mid-March in order to restrict the Falange. However, government actions were not as thorough <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have been: warnings by the Director of Security and other figures were not acted upon.|$|E
60|$|So they {{mingled with}} the throng, herding affrightedly {{together}} {{in the rear of}} the embassy, and followed in their ranks <b>as</b> best <b>they</b> <b>might.</b>|$|R
60|$|So the two ladies {{sat down}} to console themselves, <b>as</b> best <b>they</b> <b>might,</b> for the reverses which trade and love so often bring with them.|$|R
60|$|The {{tools were}} very antique and venerable in their form, and looked <b>as</b> if <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have been hanging {{where they were}} {{untouched}} for centuries.|$|R
25|$|In April 1805 Moucheron {{was in the}} Mediterranean. Lord Nelson had her {{patrol the}} Straits of Gibraltar and provide the {{garrison}} of Gibraltar such assistance <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> require.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 the British Foreign Office {{advised the}} Royal Navy not to detain pirates of certain {{national}}ities <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> {{be able to}} claim asylum in Britain under British human rights legislation, if their national laws included execution, or mutilation as a judicial punishment for crimes committed as pirates.|$|E
25|$|Armed {{with two}} {{sketches}} of the Robertson brothers <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> appear today, Rebus visits several Cowdenbeath pubs, asking customers if they recognise them. He has little luck, although a drunk old gambler claims he recognises {{one of the}} pictures, causing Rebus to suspect {{that one of the}} brothers may be working as a bookmaker.|$|E
60|$|Many present began, doubtless, {{to wonder}} for what Monsieur waited; <b>as</b> well <b>they</b> <b>might.</b> Voiceless and viewless, stirless and wordless, {{he kept his}} station behind the pile of flowers.|$|R
50|$|The Republicans were fearful as late <b>as</b> October that <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be beaten.|$|R
60|$|Neither had he met any of {{the party}} whom he saw on his {{introduction}} to the city, and it seemed <b>as</b> if <b>they</b> <b>might</b> not give him any further trouble.|$|R
25|$|The items used in {{decoration}} {{may also}} have been darker and heavier than those used today, simply as a matter of practicality. London was noisy and its air was full of soot from countless coal fires. Hence those who could afford it draped their windows in heavy, sound-muffling curtains, and chose colours that didn't show soot quickly. When all washing was done by hand, curtains were not washed as frequently <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be today.|$|E
25|$|The notions {{above are}} not as {{unfamiliar}} <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> at first appear. The customary acceptance {{of the fact that}} any real number x has a decimal expansion is an implicit acknowledgment that a particular Cauchy sequence of rational numbers (whose terms are the successive truncations of the decimal expansion of x) has the real limit x. In some cases {{it may be difficult to}} describe x independently of such a limiting process involving rational numbers.|$|E
25|$|When a {{group member}} {{does not feel}} that his/her effort is {{justified}} {{in the context of}} the overall group, the individual will be less willing to assert the effort. If the group size is large, members can feel that their contribution will not be worth much to the overall cause because so many other contributions can or should occur. This leads people to not contribute as much or at all in large groups <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have in smaller groups.|$|E

50|$|Luke {{relates to}} Fowler and the inspector's amateur-sleuth wife, Mary, (Mary Philips) how {{on a boat}} home from France, they {{encountered}} Brook, the influential lawyer, just <b>as</b> <b>they</b> hoped <b>they</b> <b>might.</b> Brook had been known to sponsor young talent and, before long, he became Susan's patron, with a personal relationship also developing between them.|$|R
60|$|The boy was stowing the {{remainder}} of the cheese and crackers into his pockets when the shopkeeper, accompanied by two men, who looked <b>as</b> if <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have been hunters or miners, entered.|$|R
25|$|The term primitive, in {{contrast}} with other uses, refers to a basis in scholarship and research into the actual writings of the church fathers and other historical documents. Since written documents for the underground first-century church are sparse, the primitive church passed down its knowledge verbally. Elements of the primitive Christianity movement reject the patristic tradition of the prolific extrabiblical 2nd- and 3rd-century redaction of this knowledge (the Ante-Nicene Fathers), and instead attempt to reconstruct primitive church practices <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have existed in the Apostolic Age. To do this, they revive practices found in the Old Testament.|$|E
25|$|The {{prohibition}} of Nasī’ would presumably have been announced when the intercalated month {{had returned to}} its position just before the month of Nasi' began. If Nasī' meant intercalation, then the number and {{the position of the}} intercalary months between 1 AH and 10 AH are uncertain; Western calendar dates commonly cited for key events in early Islam such as the Hijra, the Battle of Badr, the Battle of Uhud and the Battle of the Trench, should be viewed with caution <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be in error by one, two or even three lunar months. This prohibition was mentioned by Muhammad during the farewell sermon which was delivered on 9 Dhu al-Hijjah 10 AH (Julian date Friday 6 March, AD 632) on Mount Arafat during the farewell pilgrimage to Mecca.|$|E
25|$|The Republican {{government}} {{acted to}} remove suspect generals from influential posts. Franco was sacked {{as chief of}} staff and transferred to command of the Canary Islands. Manuel Goded Llopis was removed as inspector general and was made general of the Balearic Islands. Emilio Mola was moved from head of the Army of Africa to military commander of Pamplona in Navarre. This, however, allowed Mola to direct the mainland uprising. General Jose Sanjurjo became the figurehead of the operation and helped reach an agreement with the Carlists. Mola was chief planner and second in command. José Antonio Primo de Rivera was put in prison in mid-March in order to restrict the Falange. However, government actions were not as thorough <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have been, and warnings by the Director of Security and other figures were not acted upon.|$|E
60|$|Then men made {{ready for}} the fray <b>as</b> best <b>they</b> <b>might,</b> and stood, sword in hand and drenched with foam, {{clinging}} to the bulwarks of the Gudruda as she wallowed through the seas.|$|R
50|$|The sons of Simon of Cyrene {{are named}} <b>as</b> if <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have been early Christian figures known to Mark's {{intended}} audience (Brown et al. 628). Paul also lists a Rufus in Romans 16:13.|$|R
60|$|Down {{and down}} led the road, between two rocky crags. Soon the last trace of light was left behind, {{and they had}} to let the horses pick their own way <b>as</b> best <b>they</b> <b>might.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{investors in}} the Lowell textile {{companies}} decided {{they needed to do}} something about their transportation situation. They looked toward the railroads budding in England, and now in America, for inspiration and took operations on the Summit Hill & Mauch Chunk Railroad and the construction ongoing on the Allegheny Portage Railroad and Baltimore & Ohio {{and a handful of other}} ventures as omens and inspiration. A railroad could run year round, was expandable with as many tracks <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> need, and could use the new locomotives that were being highly praised in England at the heart of recent news stories. By 1829 the B was testing a locally produced steam locomotive, the Tom Thumb, and opened for passenger operations in May 1830. With well-publicized and ambitious plans to scale one of the gaps of the Allegheny and cross the Ohio River, and New York and Pennsylvania's canal mania sprinkled with railroads, Massachusetts and New England investors were looking at bold plans everywhere.|$|E
25|$|Straight away Munroe {{obtained}} a few lumps of black graphite which he beat to a pulp with a hammer. He separated the fine particles that floated {{to the top}} of the water with a spoon and mixed them with a clay solution. His first experiments with this lead solution was not very successful. He continued making cabinet maker’s squares and sold the few of these which he could. In this time he continued experimenting with graphite lead for pencils with little accomplishment. He had no knowledge of the subject and feared consulting others <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> take the idea and produce pencils themselves. Munroe continued experimenting in secret with graphite powder formulas on his own. Eventually he figured a way to come up with a suitable graphite paste formula of various ingredients that could be poured into a slotted line made in some cedar wood blanks. The pencil centers would be his secret formula of a mixture of dried graphite paste of clay and other unknown ingredients. They were air dried and not hardened by firing in a furnace as Europeans did, so the quality was not as good as theirs—but it was fine enough to write with.|$|E
25|$|Himilco next {{tried to}} reduce the fortresses in which the people of Messese had taken refuge, but gave up the attempt, as this proved too time consuming, and kept him from attacking Syracuse, where Dionysius would use any extra time to {{strengthen}} himself further. The ultimate Carthaginian goal was the defeat of Syracuse, Messana was just a sideshow. Bringing reinforcements from Carthage would also be time consuming as Carthage had no standing army and would need time to raise fresh mercenaries, while dividing the field army to guard Messana would decrease his striking power against Dionysius. After sacking and destroying the city, the Carthaginian army marched south along the eastern coast of Sicily, while their fleet sailed alongside. Dionysius had destroyed the cities of Naxos and Catana while expanding his power, giving Naxos to the Sicels and Catana to Campanian mercenaries. This meant fewer obstacles for Himilco to overcome along this route than along the southern coast of Sicily. Himilco could not entirely ignore the hostile Greek fortresses in his rear, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> cause problems once he left the site. His solution was simple and ingenious at the same time, something that is termed indirect approach.|$|E
60|$|These terms <b>they</b> {{accepted}} thankfully, <b>as</b> well <b>they</b> <b>might.</b> Thereupon, {{finding themselves}} abandoned by all men--even by Darnley in whose service they {{had engaged in}} the murder--Morton, Ruthven, and their associates scattered and fled.|$|R
60|$|Jamie Dove {{saved his}} bellows with difficulty. The other men, {{catching}} up their things <b>as</b> <b>they</b> best <b>might,</b> crowded {{up the ladder}} in {{a more or less}} draggled condition.|$|R
