50|$|Each {{shelving}} unit is normally {{mounted on a}} level trackway (to eliminate gradients in the supporting floor), {{making it possible to}} move heavy units with minimal effort. Mobile shelving can be moved manually or by the use of electrical motors.

40|$|There is {{a current}} trend towards ever more slender {{concrete}} floor structures, which is resulting in more frequent {{problems with their}} vibration serviceability. Predictive methods for vibration serviceability must consider not only the structures themselves, but also the non-structural elements which are attached to them, as these may {{have a significant effect}} on the dynamic characteristics of the floor structural system. As there has been very little past research in this area, this thesis describes an investigation into the effects of raised <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> on the vibration serviceability of long-span concrete floors. The development of a new modal testing facility based on electrodynamic shaker excitation, which was capable of producing high quality estimates of the modal properties of full-scale floor structures, is described. This was subsequently utilised to determine the modal properties of three full-scale floor structures, before and after the installation of various configurations of raised <b>access</b> <b>floors.</b> The response of these structures to controlled pedestrian excitation was also measured. Realistic finite element models of all structures were developed and updated using the results from the experimental work. These were subsequently utilised for investigation of the experimentally measured effects of the raised <b>access</b> <b>floors.</b> It was found that raised <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> had only minor effects on the modal properties of the long-span concrete floors. Reductions in natural frequencies due to the increased mass were, to some extent, offset by the slight increases in stiffness following the installation of the <b>access</b> <b>floors.</b> Modal damping ratios increased for some modes of vibration, but these changes were rather unpredictable and hence they were too unreliable to be used in design. The response of the structures under controlled pedestrian excitation reduced following the installation of various configurations of raised <b>access</b> <b>floors.</b> The reduction appeared to be greater for relatively deep <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> (500 - 600 mm) than for relatively shallow <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> (150 - 200 mm). Therefore, it is recommended that the effects of <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> may be included in vibration serviceability analyses by applying a reduction factor to predicted responses calculated by assuming a bare floor. The proposed reduction factors are 0. 9 for <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> where the finished floor height is less than 500 mm and 0. 8 for <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> where the finished floor height is 500 mm or greater...|$|R
40|$|A {{project in}} Civil EngineeringThe damage and failure of {{computer}} equipment typically supported by raised <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> in critical data processing facilities could have serious safety and economic implications. Current design provisions provide {{general guidance on}} how to estimate the seismic demand on non-structural elements within a structure. However, the possible lack of conservatism is of particular concern at locations near active faults where the vertical ground motion components have high amplitudes. Through reduced-order simplified modeling of a frame building and its raised <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> and computer equipment, findings are presented on the insufficiencies of current industrial spectra considering a suite of risk-targeted ground motions with both vertical and horizontal components. Excessive seismic axial force demands are found for both <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> and computer equipment. This investigation concludes that caution should be taken for seismic qualification and design of raised <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> and computer equipment systems considering vertical ground motions...|$|R
40|$|Raised <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> panels {{currently}} have a chipboard core and are encapsulated within {{thin layer of}} galvanised steel. Two key problems with these raised <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> panels are that they are heavy because of the chipboard and expensive, {{as the cost of}} steel has increased significantly over the past few years. The consequence of the raised <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> panel’s mass is that they are difficult to handle, they are expensive to transport and they add considerably to the load on a structures foundation. Glass fibre filled epoxy of floor panels were designed and optimised to achieve lighter weights without compromising their strength using Altair Hypermesh software. A material weight reduction of the glass fibre filled epoxy floor panel was achieved by optimised design of the panes using an evolutionary structural optimisation (ESO) method and the introduction of panel ribs. The lighter weight of new raised floors panel would {{have a significant impact on}} the loadings of buildings foundation and allow architects to reduce the carbon footprint of a building resulting in reduced construction costs. In addition, a reduction in the weight of the new raised <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> panels would reduce the transportation costs of the panels...|$|R
50|$|A {{raised floor}} (also raised flooring, <b>access</b> <b>floor(ing),</b> or raised access {{computer}} floor) provides an elevated structural floor above a solid substrate (often a concrete slab) {{to create a}} hidden void for the passage of mechanical and electrical services. Raised floors are widely used in modern office buildings, and in specialized areas such as command centers, IT data centers and computer rooms, {{where there is a}} requirement to route mechanical services and cables, wiring, and electrical supply. Such flooring can be installed at varying heights from 2 in to heights above 4 ft to suit services that may be accommodated beneath. Additional structural support and lighting are often provided when a floor is raised enough for a person to crawl or even walk beneath.|$|E
50|$|Pilkington's Group was {{established}} in 1891.

40|$|The European {{standard}} EN ISO 140 - 12 : 2000 gives {{a methodology}} {{to measure the}} acoustic performance of <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> {{in terms of both}} airborne and impact sound insulation. <b>Access</b> <b>floors</b> are often used in office buildings and working environments as they create a hollow space below the floor surface for network cabling and electrical wiring: in this way they are useful from the functional (ease of inspection, repair and changing of system elements), the aesthetic (no exposed wires and elements) and acoustic point of view. This paper presents the measurement procedures used at the Acoustic Laboratory of the University of Perugia – Italy, in order to perform the tests defined by the EN ISO 140 - 12. The standard requires the measurement of two parameters, Ln,f e Dn,f, that qualify respectively the airborne and the impact sound insulation trough an <b>access</b> <b>floor,</b> and the calculation of the two corresponding single number indexes Ln,f,W e Dn,f,W.

50|$|The type {{of floor}} a {{facility}} uses can also greatly affect its air flow capabilities and limitations. Specifically, a raised floor allows for under-floor cable management {{as well as}} air flow. There are two main classifications of such <b>access</b> floors: low-profile <b>floors</b> (under 6 inches in height) as well as standard/traditional <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> (over 6 inches).|$|R
50|$|Many office {{buildings}} now use <b>access</b> <b>flooring</b> {{to create more}} flexible and sustainable spaces. When underfloor air is designed into a building {{from the start of}} the project, the building can be less expensive to build and less expensive to operate over the life of the building. Underfloor air requires less space per floor, thereby reducing the overall height of the building, which in turn reduces the cost of the building facade. The blowers and air handlers required for underfloor air are much smaller and require less energy, since hot air rises naturally through the space as it comes in contact with people and equipment that warm the air and it rises to the ceiling. Additionally, when buildings are designed to combine modular electrical, modular walls, and access floor, the space within the building can be reconfigured in a few hours, as compared to historical means of demolishing walls and drilling holes in the floor to route electrical and other services. As more companies construct or renovate buildings to meet LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) underfloor air and access floor usage will continue to grow. The USGBC (United States Green Building Council) states that 40-48% of new nonresidential construction is green.|$|E
30|$|Fragility {{groups that}} {{significantly}} contribute to repair costs {{were identified as}} structural components, glass curtain wall cladding, wall partitions, suspended ceilings, HVAC equipment, and office equipment.

40|$|Low profile <b>access</b> <b>flooring</b> {{is being}} {{commonly}} used {{in a variety of}} businesses today. To understand why more businesses, need this type of flooring, it is essential that we take the time to first understand what is low profile flooring actually is. What Is Low Profile <b>Access</b> <b>Flooring</b> A low profile access floor is a floor that is designed to sit above the original concrete slab flooring installed in any home, business, or public building. The higher floor height creates a space between the floor people walk on and the concrete base. The extra space the flooring provides is used to house additional, but essential, construction and design elements. For example, businesses design and install a data cables and other wiring in this space to keep wires safely {{out of the way and}} organized. Additional electrical outlets can also be installed and access through this flooring and extension cords and additional power bars can be stowed below and kept out of the way, and out of sight, as well. Low profile access floors do just what the name says because it gives people complete access to an entire data wiring system without having to undergo any major construction while keeping everything safely hidden and out of view. The flooring is made up of panels that are raised by brackets. Bracket heights of the panels can be customized to suit the needs of a business, office, or home space. Different businesses prefer to use this type of flooring to suit different needs. For example, some businesses or public buildings such as schools and libraries only require this type of flooring for their data and server rooms. The flooring can be simply customized to suit this type of use. Why More Businesses Need Low Profile Floors Since low profile data floors allow people to hide clutter-creating elements such as wires, cables, pipes, and HVAC systems, installing this flooring will help businesses avoid accidents and save money on any possible repairs to the system being hidden. Wires and cables will no longer be strewn across staff walk way areas and unsightly air systems can be installed in the flooring rather than overhead, eliminating bulky HVAC systems and any wires hanging from the ceiling...|$|E
