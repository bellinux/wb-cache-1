5|$|In May 2001, Bouchard's {{successor}} Bernard Landry, who had {{until then}} {{lived in a}} three-room apartment, {{announced that he would}} accept the SITQ offer of the Édifice Price apartment, and took up occupancy in November. The choice, although praised for its symbolic location, attracted criticism that the apartment, rather small and poorly lit, could not accommodate a family (Landry was widowed from his first wife at the time). Some also noted that the former Lieutenant-Governor's residence, located at 1010 Chemin Saint-Louis and sold in 1996 for a fraction of its estimated value, would have made <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>choice.</b> From 1997 an exclusive psychiatric clinic had occupied the Price Building's second and third floors. This was moved out in 2002; the administration strongly affirmed the timing with the Premier's installation to be a complete coincidence.|$|E

Allegedly Görgei was angered of him because his troops suffered too many losses during their attack. In their place were put: Colonel József Kászonyi in the lead of the II. corps, and Colonel Károly Leiningen-Westerburg in the lead of the III. corps. While Leiningen will demonstrate to be <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>choice,</b> Kászonyi's appointment in the place of Asbóth, will show to be an unlucky choice. To change the corps commanders {{in the middle of a}} battle, was also a bad decision, but maybe the worst thing was that he did not kept under a direct control and observation his corps commanders - especially the hesitating Knezić - in order to make them to move in the right moment to the battlefield.

500|$|Morshead {{was one of}} only a few Allied divisional commanders with a {{distinct}} record of success {{at this stage of the}} war and had been acting commander of the British XXX Corps, a formation largely composed of Commonwealth troops, on two occasions.

500|$|Reviewers {{generally}} praised Halo Warss controls. Critics {{who were}} less experienced RTS players, such as Darren Zenko of the Toronto Star, appreciated the streamlined RTS experience. In contrast, critics such as Luke Anderson of GameSpot {{said that the}} game lacked the depth necessary to attract more seasoned RTS players. Some critics were frustrated {{by the lack of}} control features—specifically, the ability to create and manage groups of units, the lack of hotkeys, the inability to set rally points for different units, and the need to return to the base to adjust production. Nguyen wrote that [...] "finesse maneuvers [...] are more difficult to pull off than they should be". Brett Molina of USA Today said that experts would find the action oversimplified, but that the game [...] "is <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>choice</b> for fans of the Halo universe and players new to real-time strategy". Reviewers for GameSpy, G4tv, and Eurogamer stated that the controls worked well mainly because the developers omitted features to make most options quickly available; for example, limiting base construction to select areas made sure players could easily find their buildings.|$|E

40|$|When {{we asked}} a {{colleague}} of ours why people do not make more haptic musical instruments, he replied that {{he thought they were}} “too hard to program and too expensive. ” We decided to solve these perceived problems by introducing HSP, a simple platform for implementing haptic musical in-struments. HSP obviates the need for employing low-level embedded control software because the haptic device is con-trolled directly from within the Pure Data (Pd) software run-ning on a general purpose computer. Positions can be read from the haptic device, and forces can be written to the de-vice using messages in Pd. Various additional objects have been created to facilitate rapid prototyping of useful hap-tic musical instruments in Pd.

Since the course English 6 syllabus is new some aspects different from previous course syllabus English B are mentioned by way of comparison.   In order to develop the arguments for using the novel, different perspectives of reading and the learning process are discussed and how they match the curriculum Gy 11. Some points about how Morrison has managed to voice the former unspoken experiences of African American society are made to make it clear why reading The Bluest Eye is such a superb text in relation to the learning goals that are outlined in Gy 11. The essay focuses mainly on mother - daughter relationships because most pupils will easily relate to this theme since they have experiences of this relation themselves, and therefore they will find it easy to find issues to discuss after reading the novel. ...|$|R
