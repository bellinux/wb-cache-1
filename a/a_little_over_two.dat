However, he only served <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> months, {{most of the}} {{duration}} {{of which he was}} sick with a nervous breakdown, before being discharged. In October of the same year, Brinkley and his wife moved to Milford, Kansas after having spotted a newspaper ad saying the town needed a doctor.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Richard {{started to}} {{complain}} {{of pain in}} his left calf. The synthetic graft inserted in his July 1980 surgery had closed off, which meant that he needed a surgical bypass in his left leg. Richard was granted free agency by the Astros on November 7, 1983, but the Astros still had faith in him, so he was re-signed on February 17 of the following year. Just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> months later, he was released by the Astros, thus ending his baseball career. Despite an almost complete recovery, the risk of future complications {{was so great that}} he never pitched again. His final major league record was 107–71, with 1,493strikeouts and a 3.15ERA in 238games and 1,606innings. Nolan Ryan broke his Astros record for career strikeouts in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The game {{began at}} 1:35p.m. PST in rainy {{conditions}} that had affected the San Francisco Bay Area for {{days before the}} contest. The Lobos scored a touchdown on the game's first drive to take an early lead, but the Midshipmen scored three touchdowns to bring the score to 21–7 {{early in the second}} quarter. After the Lobos narrowed that lead to 12 points {{by the end of the}} third quarter, the Midshipmen began a long drive which took up much of the fourth quarter. The drive ended with a field goal, which gave Navy a 15-point lead with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> minutes remaining in the game. On the next drive from the Lobos, the Midshipmen forced a turnover on downs and ran out the clock with their last possession to win the game.|$|E

Two famous inmates were Harry Orchard and Lyda Southard. Orchard assassinated former Governor Frank Steunenberg in 1905 and Southard was known as Idaho's Lady Bluebeard for killing several of her husbands to collect upon their life insurance. Two serious riots occurred in 1971 and 1973 over living conditions in the prison. The 416 resident inmates were moved to the newly built Idaho State Correctional Institution south of Boise and the Old Idaho Penitentiary was closed on December 3, 1973.|$|R
5|$|After a {{scoreless}} first quarter, {{the second}} quarter featured three turnovers, and at half time, Penn State led 6–3 with two field goals from senior kicker Sam Ficken. On Penn State's first drive in the second half, Allen Robinson returned and caught a screen pass, which he ran for 25 yards, and then a 51-yard touchdown pass to make the score 13–3. On the ensuing drive, however, Syracuse came right back and scored a touchdown via a Jerome Smith 10-yard run. Early in the fourth quarter, Ficken made his third field goal of the day, a career-long 46 yards. Later in the quarter, Hackenberg threw a 54-yard touchdown pass to Eugene Lewis to make the score 23–10. When only down by 6 points, Syracuse got the ball around their own 45-yard line with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> minutes left, but turned the ball over via an interception with under two minutes to play.|$|E

Cancellara won the race's fourth stage after attacking {{in the final}} {{kilometers}} of the race and then out-sprinting the riders {{who were able to}} keep pace with him to win the stage. His next victory came in the first stage of the Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme, where he won the opening stage's bunch sprint. Up next on the calendar for Cancellara was the Tour of Flanders. Cancellara crossed the line in 42nd place, just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> minutes after the winner Steffen Wesemann. The next weekend, he raced the Paris–Roubaix for the second time. Cancellara showed great form during the race and {{was a member of the}} four man group that was first to reach the finish line. He lost the sprint to the line and crossed the line in fourth. Cancellara's next success came in the Tour de Luxembourg, where he won the stage four individual time trial by fourteen seconds over the second-place finisher. He then went on to win his second Swiss National Time Trial Championship in late June. Cancellara's next success came at the Tour de France. He won the prologue around the Belgian city of Liege and took the first yellow jersey as leader of the general classification. Cancellara lost the lead after the second stage to Thor Hushovd. Cancellara did participate in both the time trial and road race at the Road World Championships. Cancellara performed well in the time trial and came in eighth place; he finished over two minutes behind the winner. He entered the men's road race four days later, but did not finish the course.|$|E

40|$|In <b>a</b> work {{published}} <b>little</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> years ago, Mews et al. (2009) described {{some new}} taxa of Brazilian phalangopsid crickets. Two specific names, however, were incorrectly formed under {{the articles of}} the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN 1999), leading to the need of justified emendations, according to Article 33. 2. 2 of the Code (ICZN 1999), which I will give below. Among the new taxa described {{in the work of}} Mews et al. (2009) are Izecksohniella almeidai and Marliella titai, whose etymology of the specific names was given as follow: “The specific name [almeidai] is in honor to the ecologist and scarabaeidologist Sabrina Pinheiro Almeida, who initially collected this species. ”. “The specific name [titai] is in honor to the biologist Cândida Lahís Mews, nickname “Tita”, that collected this species for the first time. ”. According to Article 31. 1. 2 of the Code “A species-group name, if a noun in the genitive case (…) formed directly from a modern personal name, is to be formed by adding to the stem of that name-i if the personal name is that of a man,-orum if of men or of man (men) and woman (women) together,-ae if of a woman, and-arum if of women; the stem of such a name is determined by the action of the original author when forming the genitive. ” (ICZN 1999). Since almeidai and titai were each coined in honor to a woman, {{it is clear that the}} stem used in the formation of both names is incorrect under the provisions of Article 31. 1. 2 (ICZN 1999), and must be changed, as stated in Article 31. 1. 3 (“The origina...|$|R

40|$|The {{idea and}} {{the ideal of}} {{religious}} poverty exerted a powerful force throughout the Middle Ages. “Take no gold, or silver, or copper in your belts, no bag for your journey, or two tunics, or sandals, or a staff,” Christ had commanded his apostles. He had sternly warned, “it is easier for a camel {{to go through the}} eye of a needle, than for someone who is rich to enter into the kingdom of God. ” And he had instructed one of the faithful, who had asked what he needed to do to live the most holy sort of life, “if you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give your money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. ” Beginning with these biblical injunctions, voluntary poverty, the casting off of wealth and worldly goods for the sake of Christ, dominated much of medieval religious thought. The desire for a more perfect poverty impelled devout men and women to new heights of piety, while disgust with the material wealth of the church fueled reform movements and more radical heresies alike. Often, as so clearly illustrated by the case of the Spiritual Franciscans and fraticelli in the later thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the lines separating devout believer from condemned heretic shifted and even reversed themselves entirely depending on how one understood the religious call to poverty. Moreover, the Christian ideal of poverty interacted powerfully with and helped to shape many major economic, social, and cultural trends in medieval Europe. <b>As</b> Lester <b>Little</b> demonstrated <b>over</b> <b>two</b> decades ago, for example, developing ideals of religious poverty were deeply intermeshed with the revitalizing European economy of the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries and did much to shape the emerging urban spirituality of that period...|$|R
50|$|From {{the gun in}} the final, the two Japanese runner Misaki Onishi then Ayuko Suzuki {{took the}} pace out at a serious level, the women running the same pace as the {{pedestrian}} men's race through the first 2,000. After her 1500 metres win and world record, all eyes were clearly on Genzebe Dibaba. On the first lap Dibaba went {{to the back of}} the pack. After a lap she decided to move in behind the Japanese runners. Instantly she was marked by world leader Almaz Ayana. Three laps into the race, it was a string of African runners behind the Japanese, with a gap back to all the other non-Africans. From the pace of just under 74 seconds a lap, Ayana then upped the pace, followed immediately by Dibaba and the Kenyan team running as a group led by returning silver medalist Mercy Cherono. Laps started getting quicker, 68, 67, the field stringing out 65, 64 first only Dibaba was able to follow Ayana, then she was broken, Ayana out into an insurmountable lead with three laps to go and still accelerating. More than a hundred metres behind, Senbere Teferi was battling the last of the Kenyans, Viola Kibiwot for the bronze medal position. Ayana slowed <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>over</b> the last <b>two</b> laps, the pace falling back to 67 seconds but the damage was done and the race was decided. Ayana pushed home in 14:26.83 to break Genzebe's sister Tirunesh Dibaba's Championship Record. Well behind, Genzebe was content to just finish the race in silver medal position, but the battle for bronze was accelerating. Onto the home stretch, Teferi put her best move on Kibiwot and was sprinting home, but in the process she passed the slowing Dibaba. Dibaba finally noticed Teferi passing and turned into sprinting making for a close finish but Teferi had the edge and took the silver medal.|$|R
60|$|The disease {{among the}} horses still continues. Those {{who have been}} the longest up here appear {{comparatively}} safe, but {{it would seem to}} require some time to get the disease out of the blood. Every morning three or four mules are dragged out of the camp {{to the foot of the}} hills, a mile off, there to be eaten by the vultures. Yesterday afternoon my groom came to me with the unpleasant intelligence, “Sahib, your baggage-pony ill.” I went out and found him lying down. Upon the veterinary surgeon arriving he shook his head, and, pointing to the swollen tongue, said that it was the disease, and that in a couple of hours it would be dead. We tried brandy-and-water in the vain hope of reviving him, but it was quite useless, and in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>over</b> the <b>two</b> hours the pony died, having been apparently unconscious for an hour and a half previously. Yesterday, too, the horse of Dr. Lamb, chief veterinary surgeon of the transport corps, died. Dr. Lamb came up with us a week since. After spending three days here inspecting the animals he returned, but as he did not wish his horse to run the risk of again going down into the pass, he left it here in perfect health, and rode down again upon a baggage-pony. Yesterday the poor animal died, after the usual three hours’ illness. Dr. Lamb strongly recommended that all animals which can be spared should be at once sent up here. Unfortunately none of the baggage-animals, except those which work the last stage from Rayray Guddy here, can be spared. They must remain below to carry up provisions and baggage whatever the mortality may be. General Staveley has ordered that in future 10 per cent of spare animals shall accompany every train of loaded mules, to take the baggage off those who give in on the way. He has also ordered that the artillery-horses shall be instantly sent up here with their native attendants. The soldiers cannot accompany them, as their warm clothing has not yet arrived. He has also ordered that the cavalry regiments shall be sent on the instant they land. The general has taken particular interest in the transport train since he arrived at Zulla, and it is due to the order he gave and to the assistance with which he supplied them from the 33d and Beloochee regiments, that the train down at Zulla has been enabled to make head against the tremendous difficulties they have sustained owing to the wholesale desertion among the drivers, and to the uselessness of a great portion of those who remain. He has divided the baggage-animals which are in the country into regular squadrons, stationing a number at each station proportioned to the length and hardship of the journey. General Staveley, indeed, is the very man for an expedition of this sort. Whatever he sees is necessary, he takes upon himself the responsibility of ordering to be done. I consider his arrival at Zulla to have been most providential. Everything was going wrong, disorder ruled supreme. All this is now at an end. General Staveley has taken the command, and unity of action is once more introduced. Whether Colonel Phayre, now that his committee of exploration is dissolved, may determine to go down to Zulla or to remain here, is now of little importance, as Major Baigrie, the deputy-quartermaster-general, is fully capable of carrying on the duties, supported as he is by the weight of General Staveley’s authority.|$|R
