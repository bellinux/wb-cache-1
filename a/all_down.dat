In June the regiment returned to the valley, based at the Wadi Abeid, carrying out patrols and enhancing defences. At the start of July, they moved again, this time to Ain Ed Duk, relieving the Wellington Mounted Rifles. On 18 July the 1st Light Horse Brigade, to the regiment's left, was attacked by a large force of Germans. Turkish troops supporting that attack also attempted to break the regiment's line, but they were fought off. Relieved a few days later, the regiment returned to Bethlehem. Casualties during the month were <b>all</b> <b>down</b> to malaria, or other diseases, 170 men being evacuated to hospital. In August they returned to duties in the valley at Jericho, and another 109 men were evacuated to hospital during the month.|$|E

When he went to see Muhammad, he could not vocalise his intention but remained silent. Muhammad understood the reason for his being there and prompted Ali to confirm that he had come to seek Fatimah in marriage. He suggested that Ali had a shield, which if sold, would provide sufficient money to pay the bridal gift (mahr). Muhammad put forward the proposal from Ali to Fatimah, who remained silent and did not reject the proposal like the previous ones. Muhammad took this to be a sign of affirmation and consent.|$|E

500|$|Biller {{sought to}} give a more {{interesting}} look at the Borg, rather than simply focusing on their pursuit of assimilation.

It {{occurred to me that}} a group of ex-Borg would be a very interesting community to explore." [...] He wanted the potential reunification of the ex-Borg to be a moral dilemma.

500|$|Steve Leftridge from PopMatters {{considered}} the track {{to have a}} [...] "ho-hum" [...] melody. Its melody was compared to Britney Spears' [...] "Everytime" [...] (2003) and Evanescence's [...] "My Immortal" [...] (2003). During the chorus, Perry sings about holding out for a love that is [...] "cinematic and dramatic/With the perfect ending" [...] and later asks {{if she is a}} [...] "stupid girl", according to Elysa Gardner from USA Today and an anonymous reviewer for Portrait Magazine. A reviewer for Portrait Magazine, considering it to be the slowest-paced song on Teenage Dream, said it juxtaposed well with the other tracks. [...] "It takes all the energy {{from the rest of the}} album, all the fast beating hearts and overwhelming feelings of love, and slows it <b>all</b> <b>down</b> to a song about looking for love instead," [...] they wrote.|$|E

[...] In {{a review of}} the group's album Into The Gap, Parke Puterbaugh, from Rolling Stone magazine, said that the band took a [...] "new and drastic tangent" [...] and that they [...] "have slowed it <b>all</b> <b>down</b> to bring the human factor into clearer focus", adding that [...] "Hold Me Now" [...] maintains a [...] "hypnotic, swaying groove that suggests reserves of pastoral contentment even {{in the wake of the}} storm". Robert Christgau, in a review for The Village Voice, said that the song [...] "is a classic on chord changes alone, even though Tom Bailey sings it", adding that nothing else in the album Into The Gap [...] "approaches its heart-tugging mastery". J.D. Considine, in a review for The Washington Post, commented that the song's melody adds [...] "accessibility but could easily turn to dreary monotony".|$|E
500|$|On 20 September 2006, Alonso scored {{what the}} BBC {{described}} as [...] "an outrageous strike" [...] {{from his own}} half in a 2–0 Premiership win against Newcastle United. Andy Hunter of The Independent described it as [...] "one of the most audacious goals in Anfield's rich 115-year history". Alonso rebutted claims that his 70-yard goal was <b>all</b> <b>down</b> to luck and stated that he took long range shots {{as part of his}} training routine. Despite the similarity of the goals struck from inside his own half, Alonso was in no doubt which was his best. He said, [...] "I think this was better. The Luton goal bounced a few times, this one went quite straight. The Luton one was left-footed– it was different– but I am quite happy to score the goal." [...] It was his first goal for Liverpool since the goal against Luton, making distinct history as the only outfield player in modern professional football history to score two consecutive goals from inside his own half of the pitch.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Ornstein gave his last public performance. A few years later, {{he and his}} wife—the former Pauline Cosio Mallet-Prèvost (1892—1985), also a pianist—founded the Ornstein School of Music in Philadelphia. Among the {{students}} there, John Coltrane and Jimmy Smith {{would go on to}} major careers in jazz. The Ornsteins directed and taught at the school until it closed with their retirement in 1953. They essentially disappeared from public view until the mid-1970s, when they were tracked down by music historian Vivian Perlis: the couple was spending the winter in a Texas trailer park (they also had a home in New Hampshire). Ornstein had continued to compose music; equipped with a powerful memory, he was not diligent about writing it <b>all</b> <b>down</b> and had not sought to publicize it for decades. Though his style had tempered greatly since the 1910s, it retained its unique character, and with his rediscovery came a new burst of productivity. In Gann's description, piano works composed by Ornstein in his eighties, such as Solitude and Rendezvous at the Lake, featured melodies that [...] "sprang through endless ornate curlicues that brought no other composer to mind." ...|$|E

Hiryū contributed 18 B3Ns and 9 Zeros to the force; the latter encountered a flight of 6 Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from 788 Naval Air Squadron en route and shot them <b>all</b> <b>down</b> without loss. The Japanese aircraft encountered defending Hawker Hurricane fighters from Nos. 30 and 258 Squadrons RAF over Ratmalana airfield and Hiryūs fighters claimed to have shot down 11 with 3 Zeros damaged, although the fighters from the other carriers also made claims. British losses were 21 Hurricanes shot down and 2 more forced to crash land. The D3As and B3Ns inflicted some damage to the port facilities, but a day's warning had allowed much of the shipping in the harbor to be evacuated.

500|$|People writer Chuck Arnold {{wrote that}} Spears [...] "never really hit her old stride [...] {{there was a}} lot more {{strutting}} than real choreographic feats from [...] ". Jeff Montgomery of MTV both praised and dismissed Spears's performance saying, [...] "Yes, welcome to Britney's Circus, a big, huge, loud, funny, nonsensical three-ring affair... She looks great in her myriad of outfits, and she can still move with the best of them. [...] It's just, well, she's almost lost in the sheer hugeness of the production around her". Jane Stevenson of Toronto Sun gave Spears's performance three out of five stars stating there was [...] "so much was going on– there were also martial artists, bicyclists, etc.– there was no time to really assess Spears other than to note that she looked great. [...] She could lip-synch the words (one can assume) and strut around the stage well enough, but there was little in the way of genuine passion, joy, or excitement on her part". The Hollywood Reporters Craig Rosen claimed that [...] "in the end, Britney and company delivered an entertaining spectacle, but one couldn't help but wish that she would strip it <b>all</b> <b>down</b> and show a little more of herself". Sean Daly of St. Petersburg Times summed up all the reviews by stating, [...] "When Britney, touring behind her new Circus album, plays the Times Forum, there will be as many people rooting for her success as her failure. [...] But in the end, we're all envious and thankful, jealous and applauding. We like them/us and hate them/us for the very same reasons".|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Born-Again Identity", it's {{revealed}} that Castiel survived. After the Leviathans left him, {{he made his}} way out of the river, naked, and ran into his future wife Daphne. However, the experience renders Castiel amnesic, but with his angelic powers intact. Going by the name [...] "Emanuel", Castiel used his powers to heal people, though he didn't know where that ability and his power to see demon's true faces came from. After Sam is committed to a mental hospital as a result of the hallucinations of Lucifer he is suffering due to Castiel breaking his [...] "mental wall", Dean searches for [...] "Emanuel" [...] and kills a demon that is holding his wife hostage. Castiel agrees to help Dean who doesn't tell him who he really is, but mentions what [...] "Cas" [...] had done to Sam. The two are joined by Meg, but upon reaching the hospital, find demons surrounding the entrance. As Castiel is the only one who can take them <b>all</b> <b>down,</b> Dean is forced to tell him the truth about who he really is and insists he has the power to kill the demons. Castiel manages to summon his power to kill demons and kills all of them, but doing so restores his memories. Castiel shows remorse for his previous actions and initially wants to leave, but Dean is able to convince him to help by giving him back his trench coat. Castiel finds Sam in time to save him from a demon torturing him to death with electro-shock therapy and tries to restore his mental wall, but can't as it's completely gone. Feeling sorry for what he had done, Castiel transfers the problem to himself and is haunted by visions of Lucifer like Sam was. Castiel is committed to the mental hospital, but is safe from the demons as only Meg knows he's alive and she takes a job at the hospital, presumably to look after him. In [...] "Party On, Garth", Dean calls Meg and she reveals that Castiel's in the same condition, which Sam feels guilty about.|$|E

500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it <b>all</b> <b>down,</b> my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E
500|$|Manchester City's {{downward}} trajectory {{toward the}} Second Division {{continued in the}} 1997–98 season, and on 17 February 1998, manager Frank Clark was sacked. His replacement, Joe Royle, was appointed City manager on 18 February 1998. He {{had a reputation for}} playing defensive midfielders, which led to his Everton team being nicknamed the [...] "Dogs of War". Royle viewed Kinkladze as an unaffordable luxury in a relegation battle, and in his first board meeting as Manchester City manager, he opened proceedings with the words [...] "We have to sell Kinkladze". After playing the first two games under Royle, a 1–2 loss on 18 February against Ipswich Town, and a 3–1 win against Swindon Town on 23 February, [...] Kinkladze sustained an ankle injury, which sidelined him for a month. He made his return at Port Vale on 14 March, despite having taken little part in training in the preceding week. Port Vale were a team with a physically robust approach, and used the muddy conditions to their advantage. Kinkladze was played out of position on the right wing, much to his displeasure, and gave a performance that the Manchester Evening News summarised as [...] "barely noticeable". Vale defeated City 2–1, and Royle severely criticised Kinkladze for a lack of effort, dropping him for the next six games. In 2005, Royle explained his view of Kinkladze in his autobiography: [...] "To the supporters he was the only positive in all that time. To me, he was a big negative. I am not saying that City's ills were <b>all</b> <b>down</b> to Kinkladze, but there was too much about the whole Kinkladze cult phenomenon that wasn't right ...too often since his arrival, the team had under-performed. I couldn't help deducing that contrary to popular opinion, he would be my weak link not my strong one." [...] With two games remaining, Manchester City were in the relegation places, and Kinkladze was restored to the starting lineup for the home match against Queens Park Rangers (QPR). The QPR team contained Vinnie Jones, who had a violent reputation and played using the axiom [...] "if their top geezer gets sorted out early doors, you win". Jones tried to apply his philosophy to Kinkladze, even targeting him in the tunnel {{before the start of the}} match. Kinkladze opened the scoring with a free kick, but City could not maintain their lead. Defending described by The Observers reporter as a [...] "calamity" [...] culminated in an unusual own goal from Jamie Pollock, and meant the match ended in a 2–2 draw. City were relegated for the second time in three seasons despite a final day 5–2 win against Stoke City. In total, Kinkladze made 119 appearances for Manchester City, scoring 22 goals. He played regular international football during this period of his career, including in a 0–0 draw with three-time World Cup winners Italy.|$|E
