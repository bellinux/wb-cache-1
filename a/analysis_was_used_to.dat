25|$|Analysis of Ötzi's {{intestinal}} contents showed two meals (the {{last one}} consumed about eight hours before his death), one of chamois meat, {{the other of}} red deer and herb bread. Both were eaten with grain as well as roots and fruits. The grain from both meals was a highly processed einkorn wheat bran, quite possibly eaten {{in the form of}} bread. In the proximity of the body, and thus possibly originating from the Iceman's provisions, chaff and grains of einkorn and barley, and seeds of flax and poppy were discovered, as well as kernels of sloes (small plumlike fruits of the blackthorn tree) and various seeds of berries growing in the wild.

Consisting of the National Institute of Archaeology and Heritage (INSAP) of Morocco, the German Commission for Archeology of External European Affairs (KAAK), and the University of Cologne. Archaeologists dug about 2.5 meters deep into the soil inside of the rock shelter.
