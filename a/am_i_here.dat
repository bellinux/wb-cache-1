5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here?</b> Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{he studied}} {{the first of the}} {{markings}} and asked: [...] "What <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here</b> for? What <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here</b> for? Does he who sits upon the Throne desire to know how long he has to reign?" ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{she left}} me again, whilst I sat in the utter {{isolation}} and stillness, eating bread and drinking the wine, which was good. And I listened for any sound: only the faint noise of the stream. And I wondered, Why <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here,</b> on this ridge of the Alps, in the lamp-lit, wooden, close-shut room, alone? Why <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Stella {{repeated}} carelessly, [...] "since <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here.</b> Please unlock this {{desk and}} give me some writing paper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} what to think," [...] Charlie said feebly. [...] "I {{do not know}} where <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> or why <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here.</b> <b>I</b> {{remember}} that there was a fray in the street, and <b>I</b> suppose <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hurt. But why <b>was</b> <b>I</b> brought <b>here,</b> instead of being taken to my lodgings?" ...|$|R
30|$|Researcher: Don’t <b>be</b> afraid, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> to listen.|$|R
6000|$|THE OLD WOMAN. Oh, what do I care {{why you are}} here? Why <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here?</b> I, who sacrificed all my inclinations to womanly {{virtue and}} propriety! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Heard,' she says!" [...] It was {{her turn}} to play the parrot. [...] "What <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here</b> for, but to hear more? But never mind; that's all over. Has mother----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O Thumb!" [...] Nod groaned, [...] "why <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here</b> in comfort, {{while you}} and Thimble are dragged in, bound with Cullum, and hung {{all over with}} dreadful leaves and flowers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> so. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>here</b> for amusement, {{as you may}} guess; but am on {{a private}} mission to Bajee Rao. Will you inform him that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here?</b> <b>I</b> dare not say whom I come from, even to you; but can explain myself fully to him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Zack Werner: [...] "But to <b>be</b> honest, <b>I</b> didn't even {{remember}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>here.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just watching that, remembering how much I care {{for you from}} the beginning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We haven't {{been lucky}} since Sir Harry {{has had the}} hounds somehow. There doesn't {{seem to be the}} dash about 'em there used to <b>be</b> when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>here.</b> <b>I</b> had them before Sir Harry, you know." [...] All this was nearly in a whisper.|$|R
6000|$|He {{started at}} those dreadful words--so softly, so patiently spoken. [...] "You will live," [...] he said. [...] "My Carmina, what <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here</b> for but {{to bring you}} back to life?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here</b> for?" [...] {{he asked}} himself. [...] "Why should I be watch-dog--me, a wolf, a free ranger! Why should I be {{upholding}} the law? What's {{the law to}} a tramp?" ...|$|E
6000|$|DON JUAN. [Springing to his feet] No; {{and that}} is the enigma on which I ponder in darkness. Why <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here?</b> I, who repudiated all duty, trampled honor underfoot, and laughed at justice! ...|$|E
6000|$|The answer comforted me not. It {{remained}} {{clear that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not wanted either in Heaven nor upon the earth. God {{did not want}} me. He was glad {{to get rid of}} me. My mother did not want me. She could have done without me. Nobody wanted me. Why <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>here?</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|If the {{opportunity}} <b>were</b> <b>here,</b> <b>I</b> {{could do the}} job (= [...] "If {{the opportunity}} <b>were</b> <b>here,</b> <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> able to do the job") ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>here.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> away, {{beyond the}} scope of this turning; There, where the pivot is, the axis Of all this gear.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{may have}} my own ideas on that subject, as on other subjects," [...] the witness replied. [...] "But let me ask their lordships, the Judges: <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here</b> to declare {{theories}} or to state facts?" ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{a moment}} she thought: [...] "Why <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here?</b> I guess the girls were right. I am a crank--an irresponsible. Why should I want to paint these malodorous tepee dwellers? Just to be {{different}} from any one else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have I not tried?" [...] he {{answered}} bitterly. [...] "Tell me, do I so easily relinquish my great desire? Why <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here?</b> Because I {{have said to}} myself that I will not be denied. Adrienne shall be mine!" ...|$|E

[...] "Our old man was quite right--so <b>was</b> 'Op--so <b>was</b> <b>I.</b> <b>'Ere,</b> Glass!" [...] He kicked the Marine. [...] "Here's our Antonio 'as written a impromptu book!

6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} waiting, here some time, ma'am,' said Kate, {{addressing}} Madame Mantalini. 'The servant must have forgotten {{to let you}} know that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>here,</b> <b>I</b> think.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Then, for {{the first}} time, Ayesha spoke to him, and her first words were a lie. [...] "She has gone from hence upon a visit," [...] she said; [...] "and, behold, in her place <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here</b> as thine handmaiden." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here</b> only {{to suffer}} ignominies?" [...] I asked. [...] "Why {{have you made}} me with pride that cannot be satisfied, with desires that turn and rend me? Is it a jest, this world--a joke you play on your guests? I--even I--have a better humor than that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "First of all give me {{something}} to drink, for, except some water, I have had nothing since dinner yesterday. You are right, Dick; it is almost a miracle, even to me, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here.</b> <b>I</b> would not have given a penny for my chance of life, and I can no more account {{for the fact that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> than you can." ...|$|R
