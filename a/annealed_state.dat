50|$|The term {{hardened}} steel {{is often used}} for a medium or high carbon steel that has been given heat treatment and then quenching followed by tempering.

This is the most common state for finished articles such as tools and machine parts.

Bimetal of high-tin {{aluminum}} alloy and steel was fabricated by cold-rolling process; microstructure, bonding strength and bonding mechanism for bonding interface of the bimetal were investigated under cold-rolling and recrystallization <b>annealing</b> <b>state,</b> respectively. Experimental {{results indicate that}} tin phase of bimetal in cold-rolling state shows a belt type distribution, however, it, in recrystallization <b>annealing</b> <b>state,</b> is uniformly distributed just like some “isolated islands”. A well bonding interface, between layers of high–tin {{aluminum alloy}} and pure aluminum, can be obtained, {{and it is difficult}} to distinguish one layer from the other; but the interface, between layers of low-carbon steel back and pure aluminum, is clear and uneven. And meanwhile, bonding mechanism of bimetal interface, in cold-rolling state, is cold pressure welding and mechanical occluding, But it, in recrystallization <b>annealing</b> <b>state,</b> is cold pressure welding, mechanical occluding, and metallurgic bonding. After recrystallization annealing, at 350 ℃ for 2 h,the bonding strength of bimetal approaches to 92. 4 MPa, which is about 26 % higher than that of cold-rolling state...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the {{integrated}} transfer operators for positively weighted independent identically distributed smooth expanding systems give rise to <b>annealed</b> equilibrium <b>states</b> for a new variational principle. The unique <b>annealed</b> equilibrium <b>state</b> coincides with the unique <b>annealed</b> Gibbs <b>state.</b> Using work of Ruelle [1990] and Fried [1995] on generalised Fredholm determinants for transfer operators, we prove that the discrete spectrum of the transfer operators coincides with the correlation spectrum of these invariant measures (yielding exponential decay of correlations), and with the poles of an annealed zeta function, defined also for complex weights. A modified integrated transfer operator is introduced, which describes the (relativised) quenched states studied e. g. by Kifer [1992], and conditions (including SRB) ensuring coincidence of quenched and <b>annealed</b> <b>states</b> are given. For small random perturbations we obtain stability results on the quenched and annealed measures and spectra by applying perturbative results of Young and the author [1993]...|$|R
40|$|Tungsten {{samples were}} {{heat-treated}} to achieve partial recrystallization and exposed to high ion flux deuterium plasma at different temperatures and fluences. Continuous stiffness nanoindentation measurements of near-surface hardness were {{performed in the}} grains of specific <b>annealing</b> <b>states</b> and of specific crystallographic orientation, determined by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD); indentation pile-up was investigated using surface profilometry. Bulk hardness of unexposed tungsten does not strongly depend on grain orientation, but depends on the <b>annealing</b> <b>state</b> of the grain, with values between ∼ 4. 3 &nbsp;GPa for recrystallized grains and ∼ 5. 5 for non-recrystallized ones. Grains with &lt; 111 &gt; surface normal orientation feature the least pile-up, while grains with &lt; 001 &gt; orientation the most; pile-up also depends on the <b>annealing</b> <b>state,</b> being generally lower in recrystallized grains. Plasma exposure leads to the increase of hardness, most significantly near the surface. The width of plasma-affected zone increases {{with the increase of}} exposure temperature and fluence, as well in recrystallized grains, correlating with the increase of diffusion depth. Plasma exposure does not lead to the emergence of orientation-dependence of hardness. Both indentation pile-up and near-surface indentation pop-ins are generally suppressed by plasma exposure...|$|R

50|$|Copper was {{the first}} metal in common use for tools and {{containers}} since {{it is one of}} the few metals available in non-oxidized form, not requiring the smelting of an ore. Copper is easily softened by heating and then cooling (it does not harden by quenching, as in cool water). In this <b>annealed</b> <b>state</b> it may then be hammered, stretched and otherwise formed, progressing toward the desired final shape, but becoming harder and less ductile as work progresses. If work continues beyond a certain hardness the metal will tend to fracture when worked and so it may be re-annealed periodically as the shape progresses. Annealing is stopped when the workpiece is near its final desired shape, and so the final product will have a desired stiffness and hardness. The technique of repoussé exploits these properties of copper, enabling the construction of durable jewelry articles and sculptures (including the Statue of Liberty).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Tensile {{properties}} of rolled and annealed copper thin foils were investigated {{based on the}} grain size and thickness.

40|$|The work {{hardening}} behavior of high purity (4 N) aluminum was investigated {{over a wide}} range of strain. The true stress-true strain curves of both annealed and equal-channel angular pressed (ECAP) Al samples were analyzed mathematically after deformation in tensile and compression tests. In this analysis, the absolute strain calculated from the <b>annealed</b> <b>state</b> was used where the <b>annealed</b> <b>state</b> relates to zero strain and the ECAP samples have an imposed strain before subsequent deformation in tensile or compression testing. The results show that in the range of low strains, as in the deformation of annealed samples, the rate of hardening is always positive and the magnitude of the hardening rate decreases monotonously with the total strain. In the range of high strains, as in the samples subjected to ECAP, the yield stress saturates because a homogeneous microstructure is ultimately established through ECAP processing...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} devoted to the effect of a multiaxial stress state and of pre-straining on the creep {{properties}} of an austenitic stainless steel. Creep tests on both smooth and notched specimens have been carried out on type 316 L(N) steel at 600 °C. In comparison to the <b>annealed</b> <b>state,</b> pre-straining caused a substantial increase in creep lifetime but also a dramatic drop in intergranular damage resistance. The effect of a pre-strain on creep ductility was so strong that compact tension specimens in pre-strained state tested under relaxation conditions cracked, whereas specimens in <b>annealed</b> <b>state</b> were not prone to cracking. A model taking into account both pre-strain and multiaxial effects was developed and identified on the basis of local intergranular micro-cracks measurements on notched specimens. It satisfactorily predicts the results of relaxation crack propagation tests. This model may also provide a useful estimation of the relaxation cracking risk of 316 L(N) as a function of pre-strain level and stress triaxiality ratio...|$|E

The acoustic properties in the as-quenched {{and in the early}} stage of <b>annealing</b> <b>states</b> show strong anomalies at the spin glass transition.
