5|$|Imported beer {{had been}} very {{expensive}} during the initial gold rush, costing around $100 a barrel, or approximately $1 a bottle. The Dawson City Brewery had been established in the city by a businessman called T. Krozner in 1898 to manufacture a local <b>alternative,</b> <b>but</b> this had closed by 1902 as the city's population declined and prices fell.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, {{the success of}} deep-bore {{electric}} trains on the Underground suggested that local services out of London could also be electrified. Following the war, the GER needed more capacity out of Liverpool Street as it was at capacity (serving almost 230,000 passengers daily in 1921), {{but they could not}} afford electrification. They considered high powered and high tractive steam locomotives including the GER Class A55 as a possible <b>alternative,</b> <b>but</b> these were rejected because of high track loadings.|$|E
5|$|The British {{commander-in-chief}} in North America, Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, had forbidden any offensive {{action on}} the Niagara Frontier. This left the local British forces with no <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> {{to wait for the}} Americans to make the first move and try to counter any attempt at invasion. The regular troops were distributed among the defensive outposts and supplemented with militia and Native American forces.|$|E
5|$|Price: Prices {{for such}} {{products}} {{may be a}} little higher than conventional <b>alternatives.</b> <b>But</b> target groups like for example LOHAS are willing to pay extra for green products.|$|R
5000|$|These shades are not {{included}} in W3C specifications, although drafts for level 4 of the CSS Color module include a similar function [...]They are still coded without 'Grey' <b>alternatives,</b> <b>but</b> with no space before the digit.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} {{implication of this}} approach is that the employer will need to convince the court not only that it has considered <b>alternatives,</b> <b>but</b> that it has chosen the option that makes the best business sense.|$|R
5|$|The {{species in}} all {{probability}} {{has little or no}} direct impact or influence on human interests and concerns but agricultural and real estate development are a threat to the species' very narrow habitat. Collecting specimens in the dry ridges is complicated by the millions of ants which eat the bait in the trap the moment it is set on the ground. Live collecting is the <b>alternative,</b> <b>but</b> the bait is usually digested by the time the animal is taken from the trap, making food research difficult if not impossible.|$|E
5|$|At first, Queen Victoria opposed any {{engagement}} because Hélène was Roman Catholic. Victoria {{wrote to}} her grandson suggesting another of her grandchildren, Princess Margaret of Prussia, as a suitable <b>alternative,</b> <b>but</b> nothing came of her suggestion, and once Albert Victor and Hélène confided their love to her, the Queen relented and supported the proposed marriage. Hélène offered to convert to the Church of England, and Albert Victor offered to renounce his succession rights to marry her. To the couple's disappointment, her father refused to countenance the marriage and was adamant she could not convert. Hélène travelled personally to intercede with Pope Leo XIII but he confirmed her father's verdict, and the courtship ended. She later became the Duchess of Aosta.|$|E
5|$|By October 1971 Prince Souvanna {{had little}} <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> {{to accept the}} Pathet Lao program {{as the basis for}} negotiations. The Pathet Lao agreed to the new {{negotiating}} effort and on 14 October, representatives of the party arrived in Vientiane. Two weeks later they were followed by Phoumi Vongvichit, secretary general of the Pathet Lao. Communist demands included: a cessation of the U.S. bombing of Lao territory; withdrawal of all U.S. advisors and military personnel; an election for a new National Assembly; the establishment of a coalition government; and compensation and resettlement for those Lao who had been forcibly relocated would be undertaken. The pace of negotiations in Laos, however, mirrored those in South Vietnam, the impetus of which was determined by the perceived military success of the protagonists.|$|E

30|$|Equation (6) {{means that}} {{among all the}} {{alternative}} sets, the ratio of choice probabilities of any two of the decision-maker’s alternatives only associates with the utilities of these two <b>alternatives</b> <b>but</b> {{has nothing to do}} with the utilities of any other alternatives.|$|R
40|$|Bone defects {{resulting}} from congenital defects, tumor or trauma are conventionally repaired using bone graft. Allogenic and xenogenic bone grafts {{are used as}} <b>alternatives</b> <b>but</b> several problems are generally associated with them such as virus transfer, considerable care, high cost and regular immuna-defensive reaction...|$|R
5|$|In 229 BC, Rome {{declared}} war on Illyria {{and for the first}} time armies crossed the Adriatic to Illyria (the Balkan Peninsula in modern usage). An army consisting of approximately 20,000 troops, 200 cavalry units and an entire Roman fleet of 200 ships was sent to conquer Corcyra. Teuta's governor, Demetrius had little <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> to surrender, and the Romans awarded him a considerable part of Teuta's holdings (228 BC). The Roman army then landed further north at Apollonia. The combined army and navy proceeded northward together, subduing one town after another and eventually besieging the capital Scodra. Teuta finally surrendered in 227 BC, having to accept an ignominious peace. The Romans allowed her to continue her reign but restricted her to a narrow region around Scodra, deprived her of all her other holdings, and forbade her to sail an armed ship south of Lissus. They also required her to pay an annual tribute and to acknowledge the final authority of Rome.|$|E
5|$|On either 10 or 11 June 323BC, Alexander died in {{the palace}} of Nebuchadnezzar II, in Babylon, at age 32. There are two {{different}} versions of Alexander's death and details of the death differ slightly in each. Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus, and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa. He developed a fever, which worsened until {{he was unable to}} speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them. In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles, followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony. Arrian also mentioned this as an <b>alternative,</b> <b>but</b> Plutarch specifically denied this claim.|$|E
5|$|Rand {{worked long}} hours through 1942 to {{complete}} the final two-thirds of her manuscript, which she delivered on December 31, 1942. Rand's working title for the book was Second-Hand Lives, but Ogden pointed out that this emphasized the story's villains. Rand offered The Mainspring as an <b>alternative,</b> <b>but</b> this title had been recently used for another book. She then used a thesaurus and found 'fountainhead' as a synonym. The Fountainhead was published on May 7, 1943, with 7,500 copies in the first printing. Initial sales were slow, but they began to rise {{in the fall of}} 1943, driven primarily by word of mouth. The novel began appearing on bestseller lists in 1944. It reached number six on The New York Times bestseller list in August 1945, over two years after its initial publication. By 1956, the hardcover edition sold over 700,000 copies. The first paperback edition was published by New American Library in 1952.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{styles of}} mats may feature small, {{flexible}} spikes on their underside to grip carpeting underneath better, and many makeshift vehicle mats {{are becoming more}} popular, often taking the form of PVC <b>alternatives,</b> <b>but</b> rubber vehicle mats are still seen as the safest option.|$|R
25|$|Breastfeeding {{is cheaper}} than <b>alternatives,</b> <b>but</b> {{is not free}} of cost. The mother {{generally}} must eat more food than otherwise. In the US, the extra money spent on food (about US$ each week) is usually about half {{as much money as}} the cost of infant formula.|$|R
50|$|Teachers {{understand}} that politically motivated panaceas such as merit pay and eliminating tenure {{do nothing to}} improve teacher quality. Our members are open to <b>alternatives,</b> <b>but</b> we will always oppose quick fixes designed to weaken the voice of teachers and effectiveness of education employees in all jobs.|$|R
5|$|The {{failure of}} Troude's {{squadron}} {{to escape the}} British pursuit highlights {{the dominance of the}} Royal Navy in the Atlantic by 1809. With Martinique gone, and French Guiana and San Domingo falling the same year, Guadeloupe was the only remaining French possession in the West Indies. Despite the supplies carried by Troude's ships, the situation there was desperate: food shortages and financial crisis causing a collapse in the island's morale. When a further effort to resupply the island was defeated in December 1809, the French losing two more frigates, the inhabitants had no <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> to wait for the inevitable British invasion. In January 1810, Cochrane ordered an amphibious landing on Guadeloupe, which rapidly overwhelmed the weakened defenders and eliminated the last remaining French colony in the Caribbean Sea.|$|E
25|$|An <b>alternative,</b> <b>but</b> also uncertain, {{etymology}} derives {{the name}} from {{the name of the}} sage Kashyapa who is believed to have settled people in this land. Accordingly, Kashmir would be derived from either kashyapa-mir (Kashyapa's Lake) or kashyapa-meru (Kashyapa's Mountain).|$|E
25|$|Health freedom-orientated {{writers and}} campaigners {{tend to see}} {{restrictive}} legislation on supplements as being {{designed to protect the}} interests of the pharmaceutical industry. If herbal medicines and supplements are removed from sale, they argue, patients will have no <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> to use conventional pharmaceutical medicines.|$|E
40|$|Unplanned {{pregnancy}} {{remains a}} major problem in the United States, despite the widespread usage of contraception. Improper and inconsistent usage of short acting reversible contraception contributes to the unplanned pregnancy epidemic. Hormonal and copper intrauterine devices are safe and cost-effective <b>alternatives,</b> <b>but</b> usage in the Unites States remains low...|$|R
50|$|There {{are social}} choice theory {{definitions}} of seemingly reasonable criteria {{that are a}} measure of the fairness of certain aspects of voting, including non-dictatorship, unrestricted domain, non-imposition, Pareto efficiency, and independence of irrelevant <b>alternatives</b> <b>but</b> Arrow's impossibility theorem states that no voting system can meet all these standards.|$|R
5000|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{attempts}} to replace hydrostatic transmissions with lower cost <b>alternatives,</b> <b>but</b> these attempts, which include variable belt types, e.g., MTD's [...] "Auto Drive", and toroidal, have various performance or perception problems that have caused their market life to be short or their market penetration to be limited.|$|R
25|$|Kadıköy {{does not}} have as much nightlife as Beyoğlu (where nightlife also {{continues}} much later into the night), nor does it have Nişantaşı's style of shopping or the Bosphorus for nightlife. Instead, it is often considered a modest <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> may still be regarded as vibrant and cosy.|$|E
25|$|Butanol {{is one of}} many side {{products}} {{produced from}} current fermentation technologies; as a consequence, current fermentation technologies allow for very low yields of pure extracted butanol. When compared to ethanol, butanol is more fuel efficient as a fuel <b>alternative,</b> <b>but</b> ethanol can be produced at a much lower cost and with much greater yields.|$|E
25|$|Disease and {{sickness}} was sweeping {{through the}} ranks and, since the ships were in a bad state, Cecil finally decided {{that there was no}} <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> to return to England, having captured few or no goods, and having made little impact on Spain. So, in December, the fleet returned home. The expedition cost the English an estimated £250,000.|$|E
50|$|Applying these {{definitions}} to {{the diagram}} below, {{the goal is}} the parent of the four criteria, and the four criteria are children of the goal. Each criterion is a parent of the three Alternatives. Note {{that there are only}} three <b>Alternatives,</b> <b>but</b> in the diagram, each of them is repeated under each of its parents.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, of course, that is {{possible}} also. I am very much indebted to you, Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which presents several interesting <b>alternatives.</b> <b>But</b> the practical point which we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it {{is or is not}} advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall." ...|$|R
40|$|Description Heller-Heller-Gorfine (HHG) {{tests are}} {{a set of}} {{statistical}} tests of independence between two random vectors of arbitrary dimensions. For the case of testing independence between random variables (rather than vectors), the package also offers implementations of the DDP and ADP tests which are consistent against all continuous <b>alternatives</b> <b>but</b> are distribution-free, and thus much faster to apply...|$|R
25|$|A {{simple method}} {{requiring}} no specialized equipment is to snort water from cupped hands, but this clears {{little more than}} the nostrils. The application of commercially available saline nasal spray is another simple <b>alternative,</b> <b>but</b> it is relatively inefficient for washing away debris, although it may suffice for simple rehydration of mucous and tissues.|$|E
25|$|Its {{membership}} in the amphetamine class has made pseudoephedrine a sought-after chemical precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine and methcathinone. As {{a result of the}} increasing regulatory restrictions on the sale and distribution of pseudoephedrine, many pharmaceutical firms have reformulated, or {{are in the process of}} reformulating medications to use <b>alternative,</b> <b>but</b> less effective, decongestants, such as phenylephrine.|$|E
25|$|Emissions may {{be reduced}} through more {{efficient}} and higher combustion temperature and through more efficient production of electricity within the cycle. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) of emissions from coal-fired power stations is another <b>alternative</b> <b>but</b> the technology is still being developed and will increase the cost of fossil fuel-based production of electricity. CCS may not be economically viable, unless the price of emitting CO2 to the atmosphere rises.|$|E
50|$|The Russian Cup final {{was held}} {{for the first time}} ever at Central Stadium in Astrakhan. Kuban Stadium in Krasnodar and Otkrytie Arena in Moscow were touted to be other {{potential}} <b>alternatives</b> <b>but</b> ultimately the stadium was announced by the Russian Football Union as the venue of the final through an official statement on Twitter on 30 March 2015.|$|R
5000|$|AIE does {{tend to be}} {{somewhat}} more elaborate than these <b>alternatives.</b> <b>But</b> practitioners [...] {{argue that it is}} no more complicated than analysis methods used in many other fields, as long as trained specialists are used. It also becomes more important to choose rigor over simplicity when the decisions being analyzed are much larger and riskier.|$|R
50|$|This notion {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} to the European transport policy in which one do not seek, like in the 2001 white paper, to oppose transport modes one to another, i.e. opposing roads to its <b>alternatives,</b> <b>but</b> rather to find an optimum exploiting the domains of relevance of the various transport modes and of their combinations.|$|R
