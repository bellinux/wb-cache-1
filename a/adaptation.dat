40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Not {{only does}} the {{publication}} of Ovidian <b>adaptations</b> online increase public awareness of Ovid, but it also offers new material for research and pedagogical purposes. Consequently, in this thesis, I explore both the historical tradition of Ovidian <b>adaptations,</b> specifically <b>adaptations</b> of Ovid's Orpheus tale, and the modern presentation of Ovidian <b>Adaptations</b> online. In {{the first half of}} the thesis, I trace the thematic connections between historical and modern <b>adaptations</b> of Ovid's Orpheus myth. My analysis reveals that despite changes in form and medium, from printed poems to Internet video games, Ovidian <b>adaptations</b> return to Ovid's distinct thematic emphasis on exploring human passions and expressing an individual's emotional tensions through art. In the second half of the thesis, I focus on the pedagogical implications of locating Ovidian <b>adaptations</b> on the public space of the Internet. I contend that online <b>adaptations</b> offer educators the possibility of showing students interpretive models and of making student knowledge and experience central to learning in the classroom...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLamongan Municipality {{suffered}} from drought which damaged 12, 519 hectares/year from 2004 to 2011. The drought caused failure to paddy harvesting and limited clean water supply. The Current <b>adaptations</b> are only prioritizing and reducing water use. In addition, changing on farming method {{is one of}} the <b>adaptations</b> as well. These <b>adaptations</b> are inadequate to decrease the impacts of drought. Thus, this paper proposes effective <b>adaptations</b> to drought in Lamongan. To propose effective <b>adaptations,</b> we analyze potential drought areas in the municipality by using overlay and a raster calculator in ArcMap based on SPI Value. Afterward, we assess current <b>adaptations</b> by using Guttman scale to 100 respondents. Finally, we propose effective <b>adaptations</b> for every stage of disaster risk management cycle by using descriptive analysis. 15 out of 27 regencies in Lamongan Municipality suffer from the moderate drought. In total, those areas cover 15, 107. 9 hectares. The analysis of Guttman scale identifies that the current <b>adaptations</b> are in a reactive form of responses. As a result, we propose some effective <b>adaptations</b> which include selecting paddy seeds, providing economic incentives for water use reductions, and activating community savings as well as community friendly EWS (Early Warnig System) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Context-oriented {{programming}} languages provide dedicated programming abstractions {{to define}} behavioral <b>adaptations</b> and means to recompose them dynamically according to sensed context changes. Additionally, {{some of these}} languages have proposed abstractions to explicitly define dependency relations between <b>adaptations.</b> Such dependency relations enable programmers to specify allowed and disallowed interactions between behavioral <b>adaptations</b> at a high abstraction level. In this paper, we explore Petri nets as an underlying formalism to model contextdependent <b>adaptations</b> and their dependencies. Petri nets offer a precise notation and semantics for behavioral <b>adaptations</b> and the dependency relations between them. Even more, Petri nets {{can be used as}} an underlying representation to manage dependency relations, and activations and deactivations of behavioral <b>adaptations</b> at runtime. We illustrate the ideas through the context-oriented programming language Subjective-C. ...|$|R
