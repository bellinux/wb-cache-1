5|$|Duke is {{the tenth}} studio album by English rock band Genesis, {{released}} in March 1980 on Charisma Records. The album followed {{a period of}} inactivity for the band in early 1979. Phil Collins moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, {{in an effort to}} salvage his failing first marriage, while Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford recorded solo albums. Collins returned to the UK after his marriage ended and wrote a significant amount of material, some of which was used for Duke and some was later reworked for his first solo album, Face Value. Duke contained a mix of individually-written songs and tracks that evolved from jam sessions in mid-1979, while recording took place {{at the end of the}} year. The break in activity rejuvenated the band, and they found the album <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>one</b> to work on.|$|E
5|$|In essence, the lbw law {{remained}} the same between 1839 and 1937, despite several campaigns to have it changed. An 1863 proposal to allow a batsman to be lbw if the ball hit his body at any point between the wickets, regardless of where the ball pitched or whether it would hit the wicket at all, came to nothing. There were few complaints until the proportion of lbw dismissals in county cricket began to increase during the 1880s. Until then, batsmen used their pads only to protect their legs; their use for any other purposes was considered unsporting, and some amateur cricketers did not wear them at all. As cricket became more organised and competitive, some batsmen began to use their pads as a second line of defence: they lined them up with the ball so that if they missed with the bat, the ball struck the pad instead of the wicket. Some players took this further; if the delivery was not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>one</b> from which to score runs, they attempted no shot and allowed the ball to bounce safely off their pads. Arthur Shrewsbury was the first prominent player to use such methods, and others followed. Criticism of this practice was heightened by the increased quality and reliability of cricket pitches, which made batting easier, led to higher scores and created a perceived imbalance in the game.|$|E
25|$|Cavour {{formed a}} {{coalition}} with Urbano Rattazzi {{known as the}} Connubio ("union"), uniting the moderate men of the Right and of the Left, and brought about {{the fall of the}} d'Azeglio cabinet in November 1852. The King reluctantly accepted Cavour as prime minister, the most conservative possible choice, but their relationship was never <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E

60|$|He {{had struck}} upon a key which {{rendered}} {{the task of}} commencement <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>one.</b> Brother Charles turned, and {{said that it was}} a death of which they had to tell him, but that his niece was well.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to playing football in high school, Crabtree {{was also on}} the basketball team and ranked among the top 51 recruits {{in the state of}} Texas going into college. During a visit in 2004, Texas Tech basketball coach Bob Knight asked Crabtree which sport he was going to choose. Though the decision was not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>one,</b> he opted to play college football exclusively.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to this tactic, the Ulivo {{coalition}} won {{the elections}} and Prodi became prime minister. Bertinotti's {{relationship with the}} centre-left leader was not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>one,</b> and in 1998, when Prodi proposed a new budget, incorporating {{a vote of confidence}} in his government, Bertinotti and the Rifondazione voted against it, causing the fall of the government. Cossutta's faction refused to vote against the government and left the party. They subsequently established a new party, the Party of Italian Communists (Partito dei Comunisti Italiani, PdCI).|$|E
25|$|Travelling {{south in}} the summer, she met Charles at Kineton, near Edgehill, before {{travelling}} on to the royal capital in Oxford. The journey through the contested Midlands was not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>one,</b> and Prince Rupert was sent to Stratford-upon-Avon to escort her. Despite the difficulties of the journey, Henrietta Maria greatly enjoyed herself, eating {{in the open air}} with her soldiers and meeting friends along the way. She arrived in Oxford bringing fresh supplies to great acclaim; poems were written in her honour, and Jermyn, her chamberlain, was given a peerage by the King at her request.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Where {{have you}} come from?' was the next question; and this being <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>one</b> to answer, Nell {{mentioned}} {{the name of the}} village in which their friend the schoolmaster dwelt, as being less likely to be known to the men or to provoke further inquiry.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Egremont lived {{between three}} and four years, more {{contented}} and peaceful {{than he had ever}} been, though frequently suffering, and sometimes giving way to temper and impatience. But Mr. Dutton understood how to manage on these occasions, and without giving up his own extensive usefulness, could give him such care, attention, and amusement as beguiled his discomforts, and made his daughter's task <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>one.</b>|$|R

Behold, I appear to you, my leetle brother, in my camisa--my shirt! I blow on myself; I gif myself away." ...|$|R
25|$|In June 1915, the British {{government}} appointed Wessels {{administrator of}} the Orange Free State, seeing in him a loyal ally. The job was not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>one</b> and asked all of Wessels' diplomatic skills. As a British appointee {{and a member of}} the South African Party he initially ran into considerable opposition and enmity from both the Executive Committee and the Provincial Council, of which most of the members supported the National Party. Nevertheless, Wessels succeeded in making his administration a success, and in 1919 the Union government proposed him for a knighthood, which he received in the 1920 New Year Honours.|$|E
25|$|After {{the siege}} of Tyre (332 BC) Alexander {{entrusted}} his fleet to Hephaestion, who had orders to skirt the coast and head for Gaza, their next objective, while Alexander himself led the army overland. Hephaestion's task was not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>one</b> for {{this was not the}} Athenian fleet with which Alexander had started and had earlier disbanded, but a motley collection of semi-reluctant allies of many nationalities who would need holding together with patience and strength. Furthermore, on arrival at Gaza the cargo of siege engines had to be unloaded, transported across difficult terrain and reassembled.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Papa Roach {{released}} {{their first}} EP titled Potatoes for Christmas. Drummer Dave Buckner was temporarily replaced by Ryan Brown, as Buckner was spending {{the year in}} Seattle studying art. In 1995, they released a demo at Sound Farm Studios titled Caca Bonita. By this time Buckner was back. In 1996, they replaced original bass guitarist Will James, who had become heavily involved in a church summer camp, with Tobin Esperance, because James' absence would limit the band's summer practicing and touring. As Esperance {{had been with the}} band as a roadie for a while, the transition was <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, we {{will look}} at two {{families}} of algebras with connections to hyperplane arrangements that admit actions of finite groups. One of the fundamental questions to ask is how these decompose into irreducible representations. For the first family of algebras, we will use equivariant cohomology techniques to reduce the computation to <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>one.</b> For the second family, we will use two decompositions over the intersection lattice of the hyperplane arrangement to aid us in computation...|$|R

25|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, and with war looming, the Canadian chief of Naval Staff had {{designated}} the three 'Prince' ships as candidates for conversion to armed merchant cruisers, {{for the task}} of convoy escort. During the protracted negotiations for the CN ships, all three vessels had been inspected by the Naval Service and specifications drawn up. It was recognized that the task of converting the fast liners would not be <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>one.</b> Their hulls and engines were basically sound. Prince Robert, which had had no accidents and had been well maintained, was to present no problems. Her sister ships, on the other hand, were a different story: both were in need of major repairs.|$|E
25|$|In 1759, Gainsborough and {{his family}} moved to Bath, living at number 17 The Circus. There, he studied portraits by van Dyck and was {{eventually}} able to attract a fashionable clientele. In 1761, he began to send work to the Society of Arts exhibition in London (now the Royal Society of Arts, of which {{he was one of the}} earliest members); and from 1769 he submitted works to the Royal Academy's annual exhibitions. He selected portraits of well-known or notorious clients in order to attract attention. The exhibitions helped him acquire a national reputation, and he was invited to become a founding member of the Royal Academy in 1769. His relationship with the academy was not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>one</b> and he stopped exhibiting his paintings in 1773.|$|E
25|$|On 18 June 1918 Mannock {{was sent}} to England on leave. He {{travelled}} to Birmingham to visit his mother. The visit was not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>one</b> as she had become an alcoholic. On this visit family friends reported on his state of mind. Mannock broke down on one occasion and seemed full of nervous tension. This was possibly due to combat fatigue. Commander Caldwell noted Mannock never took time off unless it was officially scheduled leave and he never reported sick, but saw not signs that Mannock was about to crack-up. Mannock also did not want a command and preferred to remain on operations with 74 Squadron. As a senior flight commander Mannock never showed weakness {{in front of his}} men.|$|E
60|$|Tom {{was soon}} busy at his work; but, {{as the woman}} was at no great {{distance}} from him, he often glanced an eye to her, at her work. He saw, at a glance, that a native adroitness and handiness made the task to her <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>one</b> than it proved to many. She picked very fast and very clean, and {{with an air of}} scorn, as if she despised both the work and the disgrace and humiliation of the circumstances in which she was placed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You are {{thinking}} of the Morville temper,' said her mother; 'but I am not afraid of it. A naturally hot temper, controlled like his by strong religious principle, is far safer than <b>a</b> cool <b>easy</b> <b>one,</b> without the principle.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “The {{affair was}} <b>a</b> very <b>easy</b> <b>one,</b> sir, {{for it was}} by bribery rather than force that I got away.” And he then related {{the manner in which}} he had been befriended by Don Filippo Conchas and his cousin.|$|R
25|$|In July 1810, {{shortly before}} {{completion}} of the lines, Fletcher left the fortifications to serve alongside Wellington once more in the field, and was thus at the Battle of Buçaco (27 September 1810) where he again distinguished himself and was mentioned in dispatches. Wellington fell back to the Lines of Torres Vedras in October 1810, pursued by Marshal Masséna, who was shocked to find such extensive defences, having been promised by Portuguese rebels that the road to Lisbon was <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>one.</b> Wellington's superiors were equally surprised {{to hear about the}} defences when they later received his report. After an unsuccessful attack on 18 October, Masséna initially retreated to Santarém but when his supplies ran out the following March, he abandoned any thoughts of another attempt and headed north.|$|E
25|$|The fall of soviet-style {{communism}} in 1989 elated the cultural world, {{but the experience}} hasn't been <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>one</b> due to problems in the transition period and {{the adoption of a}} free market economy. The discontinuation of state and political control of culture brought about the long dreamt freedom of expression, but, at the same time, the state subsidies also stopped and Romania's culture was seriously affected by the side-effects of the incipient, still very imperfect, free market economy and by inadequate material resources. Culture has had to cope with a variety of problems, one of them being a shift in people's interest towards other areas such as the press and television. The search for a new cultural policy, relying on decentralisation, seems to prevail now. People speak about a crisis of culture in this country, but if there is a crisis of culture, it is only at an institutional level.|$|E
25|$|Actually, the {{concession}} by Flook made the Flook case <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>one.</b> But one could hardly expect any applicant {{in a subsequent}} case to make a similar concession. It is unclear how to apply {{the principle of the}} Flook case to other cases where no such concession exists. In one class of case, where the implementation is utterly trivial on its face, as in Funk v. Kalo Inoculant Co., the applicability of the same principle seems clear. But that appears to be the outer limit of the easy case. Once reasonable persons can differ on whether the implementation is barely removed from the natural principle, {{it would seem that the}} Flook principle cannot be employed. If a full-scale Graham v. Deere analysis must be used to evaluate the implementation, it would seem that the case can no longer be disposed of on section 101 grounds. That is what appears to have happened in the next member of the trilogy, Diamond v. Diehr.|$|E

40|$|We report three {{experiments}} that examine transfer between structurally and superficially similar insight problems. Experiment 1 showed spontaneous positive transfer from a difficult insight problem to <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>one,</b> but not vice versa. Experiment 2 replicated this asymmetry when {{participants were given}} an explicit hint as to the relatedness of the problems. Experiment 3 introduced physical props to reduce problem difficulty, but failed to promote transfer from easier to more difficult problems. This transfer asymmetry {{is consistent with the}} proposal that the same processes are used to solve insight and non-insight problems, and offers a new focus for modeling in theories of analogical transfer...|$|R
25|$|The venture {{was not a}} {{commercial}} success, and it was sold to various millers, who owned watermills along its length. The section above Swafield locks was abandoned in 1893, and from 1922 it was owned by the North Walsham Canal Company, set up by Edward Cubitt and George Walker, who were mill owners. The last commercial use of the canal was in 1934, and it avoided nationalisation in 1948. With the dawning of the leisure age, the canal was seen as <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>one</b> to restore, but work to do so did not start until 2000, when the East Anglian Waterways Association (EAWA) started to run working parties for volunteers. In 2008 the North Walsham and Dilham Canal Trust was formed, and jointly run working parties with the EAWA. In 2009, part of the canal was sold to the Old Canal Company, who have worked to restore two locks and the pounds in between, in order to run Bacton Wood Mill as a watermill. Rewatering was interrupted by the Environment Agency issuing a stop notice in April 2012, but negotiations continue.|$|E
25|$|Sent {{by their}} Provincial St.Thomas of Villanova, {{the first group}} of Spanish/Castilian Augustinians arrived in Mexico in 1533 after the subjugation of Aztec Mexico by Hernan Cortez. Melchor de Vargas composed, in 1576, a {{catechism}} in the Mexican Otomi language; Diego Basalenque (d. 1651) and Miguel de Guevara compiled works in the languages of the Matlaltzinkas of Mexico; Manuel Perez translated the Roman Catechism into Aztec in 1723. Monasteries sprang up in the principal places and became the centers of Christianity, art, and civilization. The Patio (Cloister) of the former monastery of St. Augustine, now the post office, at Querétaro, {{is one of the most}} beautiful examples of stone-carving in America. They soon formed multiple priories, including at Guanajuato (pictured) and were later instrumental in establishing the Pontifical and Royal University of Mexico. By 1562 there were nearly 300 Spanish Augustinians in Mexico, and they had established some 50 priories. Their history in Mexico was not to be <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>one,</b> given the civil strife of events like the Cristero War, periodic anti-clericalism and suppression of the church that was to follow.|$|E
25|$|Crespin {{was born}} in Marseille in 1927. She moved to Nîmes with her family {{at the age of}} five and her parents opened a large shoe store in that city which they ran for many years. Crespin's {{childhood}} was not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>one,</b> being affected both by growing up during World War II and her mother's alcoholism. She initially intended to be a pharmacist but was prevented in pursuing this path after failing to pass her Baccalauréat at the age of 16. Up to this point her father had not allowed her to study singing. However, as her career path was limited by the exam results he finally allowed her to start taking lessons for purely pragmatic reasons. She went on to win first prize in a singing competition a few years later, and, at the age of nineteen, she went to Paris to study at the Conservatoire de Paris in the classes of Suzanne Cesbon-Viseur and Georges Jouatte. Four years later, in 1950, she was awarded first prize in the school's onstage competitions for opera and opéra comique and second prize in the school's singing competition. Traditionally past winners of Conservatoire's competitions were offered performance contracts with the Opéra National de Paris, but Crespin was for some unknown reason not offered one. This created a somewhat tenuous relationship between Crespin and her country's musical establishment which extended into the early portion of her career.|$|E
