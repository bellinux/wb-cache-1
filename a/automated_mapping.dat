Manual auscultatory systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP) were obtained from 20 healthy subjects under resting and talking conditions.

Further, as the most important component of drainage system, generalization of rivers properly becomes a focal point. On land, rivers always connect together in networks, and most of these networks form tree structures. As a set of line features, river networks are generalized from large scale to small scale by two main steps: selective omission and selected rivers simplification. Before these steps, the structured dendritic river networks should be constructed.
