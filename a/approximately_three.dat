5|$|Between 1847 and 1870, the {{population}} of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000.

Steamships, including those owned by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, began regular service from San Francisco to Panama, where passengers, goods and mail would take the train across the Isthmus and board steamships headed to the East Coast.
