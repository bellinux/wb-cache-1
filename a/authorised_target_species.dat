40|$|Restoration of {{semi-natural}} {{calcareous grassland}} needs to overcome dispersal limitation and microsite limitation. The effectiveness of sowing {{a mix of}} ten <b>target</b> <b>species</b> in combination with various pre-sowing disturbance techniques and post-establishment management regimes in overcoming these limitations, and in promoting vegetation change towards the restoration target was tested in a field experiment. Our results illustrate the importance of bare ground for introducing <b>target</b> <b>species</b> of calcareous grassland into species-poor grassland, and the slowness of colonisation by additional <b>target</b> <b>species</b> from outside even when a site is situated close to high-quality grassland {{that could serve as}} source for additional <b>target</b> <b>species...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Relative Importance Index (RII) {{method for}} {{determination}} of appropriate <b>target</b> <b>species</b> for dynamic adaptive chemistry (DAC) simulations using the directed relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP) method {{was developed and}} validated for two fuels. The conventional method of DRGEP <b>target</b> <b>species</b> selection involves picking an static set of <b>target</b> <b>species</b> based on the expected major combustion processes; however, these static <b>target</b> <b>species</b> may not remain important throughout a combustion simulation. The RII method determines appropriate DRGEP <b>target</b> <b>species</b> solely from the local thermochemical state of the simulation, enabling DAC simulations to better respond to changing combustion conditions while ensuring that accuracy is maintained. Further, the RII method reduces the expertise required of users to select DRGEP <b>target</b> <b>species</b> sets. The RII method was tested on constant volume ignition delay studies as well as single-cell engine simulations under homogenous charge compression ignition (HCCI) conditions for n-heptane and isopentanol reaction mechanisms. It is illustrated that the RII is capable of accurate predictions of constant volume ignition delays {{over a wide range}} of starting conditions. Further, for a similar maximum error in ignition delay predictions, under certain autoignition conditions the RII method produced considerably smaller local skeletal mechanisms compared to those of conventional DRGEP <b>target</b> <b>species</b> selections; however, both methods generated similarly sized local skeletal mechanisms outside these regions. In addition, the RII method was capable of accurately predicting ignition crank angles for single cell engine simulations under HCCI conditions with significantly smaller local skeletal mechanisms than conventional DRGEP <b>target</b> <b>species</b> selections...|$|R

40|$|Decadal-scale {{observations}} of marine reserves suggest that indirect effects on taxa that occur through cascading trophic interactions {{take longer to}} develop than direct effects on <b>target</b> <b>species.</b> Combining and analyzing {{a unique set of}} long-term time series of ecologic data in and out of fisheries closures from disparate regions, we found that the time to initial detection of direct effects on <b>target</b> <b>species</b> (±SE) was 5. 13 ± 1. 9 years, whereas initial detection of indirect effects on other taxa, which were often trait mediated, took significantly longer (13. 1 ± 2. 0 years). Most <b>target</b> <b>species</b> showed initial direct effects, but their trajectories over time were highly variable. Many <b>target</b> <b>species</b> continued to increase, some leveled off, and others decreased. Decreases were due to natural fluctuations, fishing impacts from outside reserves, or indirect effects from <b>target</b> <b>species</b> at higher trophic levels. The average duration of stable periods for direct effects was 6. 2 ± 1. 2 years, even in studies of more than 15 years. For indirect effects, stable periods averaged 9. 1 ± 1. 6 years, although this was not significantly different from direct effects. Populations of directly <b>targeted</b> <b>species</b> were more stable in reserves than in fished areas, suggesting increased ecologic resilience. This is an important benefit of marine reserves with respect to their function as a tool for conservation and restoration...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of {{population}} management on the community a <b>target</b> <b>species</b> belongs to is of key importance for successful management. It is known that the removal or extinction of a single species in a community may lead to extinctions of other community members. In our study we assess the impacts of population management on competitive communities, studying the response of both locally stable and unstable communities of varying size (between four and ten species) to three different management strategies; harvesting of a <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> harvesting with non-targeted catch, and stocking of the <b>target</b> <b>species.</b> We also studied the consequences of selecting <b>target</b> <b>species</b> with different relative abundances, as well as {{the effects of}} varying environmental conditions. We show here how the effects of management in competitive communities extend far beyond the target population. A crucial role is played by the underlying stability properties of the community under management. In general, locally unstable communities are more vulnerable to perturbation through management. Furthermore, the community response is shown {{to be sensitive to the}} relative density of the <b>target</b> <b>species.</b> Of considerable interest is the result that even a small (2. 5...|$|R

Treatments consisted of four initial seed mixtures comprising 4, 8, 12 and 16 species that represent four functional groups C 3 graminoids, C 4 grasses, N-fixing species, and late-flowering composites) that predominate within North American prairies. Once seeded, half of the plots were left alone to develop without subsequent reseeding. To provide multiple opportunities for establishment, we reseeded the remaining plots with any <b>target</b> <b>species</b> that failed to establish after two growing seasons. There were two 16 x 16 m (256 m 2) replicates per treatment established in 1994 and 1996 on former agricultural land. Annually, we measured total species richness and evenness, total cover, and establishment success defined as <b>target</b> <b>species</b> richness and total percentage cover by <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> collectively. In some instances, significant treatment x year interactions indicated that treatment effects on variables varied among years. Both richness and rate of establishment of target communities were higher in the more species-rich mixtures. Moreover, richness of resident species in the plots declined with increasing <b>target</b> <b>species</b> richness. Reseeding had no measurable effect on any of the variables, nor on the eventual establishment of target communities or individual <b>target</b> <b>species.</b> Our results, indicating that establishment of species-rich plant communities can be enhanced by starting with larger numbers of species at the outset, have implications for projects in which community biodiversity creation and maintenance are key goals...|$|R
40|$|Camera traps {{have proven}} very useful in ecological, {{conservation}} and behavioral research. Camera traps non-invasively record presence {{and behavior of}} animals in their natural environment. Since the introduction of digital cameras, large amounts of data can be stored. Unfortunately, processing protocols did not evolve {{as fast as the}} technical capabilities of the cameras. We used camera traps to record videos of Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber). However, a large number of recordings did not contain the <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> but instead empty recordings or other species (together non-target recordings), making the removal of these recordings unacceptably time consuming. In this paper we propose a method to partially eliminate non-target recordings without having to watch the recordings, in order to reduce workload. Discrimination between recordings of <b>target</b> <b>species</b> and non-target recordings was based on detecting variation (changes in pixel values from frame to frame) in the recordings. Because {{of the size of the}} <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> we supposed that recordings with the <b>target</b> <b>species</b> contain on average much more movements than non-target recordings. Two different filter methods were tested and compared. We show that a partial discrimination can be made between target and non-target recordings based on variation in pixel values and that environmental conditions and filter methods influence the amount of non-target recordings that can be identified and discarded. By allowing a loss of 5 % to 20 % of recordings containing the <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> in ideal circumstances, 53 % to 76 % of non-target recordings can be identified and discarded.

40|$|Background: In a world {{limited by}} data {{availability}} and limited funds for conservation, scientists and practitioners must use indicator groups to define spatial conservation priorities. Several studies have evaluated {{the effectiveness of}} indicator groups, but still {{little is known about}} the consistency in performance of these groups in different regions, which would allow their a priori selection. Methodology/Principal Findings: We systematically examined the effectiveness and the consistency of nine indicator groups in representing mammal species in two top-ranked Biodiversity Hotspots (BH) : the Brazilian Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest. To test for group effectiveness we first found the best sets of sites able to maximize the representation of each indicator group in the BH and then calculated the average representation of different <b>target</b> <b>species</b> by the indicator groups in the BH. We considered consistent indicator groups whose representation of <b>target</b> <b>species</b> was not statistically different between BH. We called effective those groups that outperformed the target-species representation achieved by random sets of species. Effective indicator groups required the selection of less than 2 % of the BH area for representing <b>target</b> <b>species.</b> Restricted-range species were the most effective indicators for the representation of all mammal diversity as well as <b>target</b> <b>species.</b> It was also the only group with high consistency. Conclusions/Significance: We show that several indicator groups could be applied as shortcuts for representing mamma...|$|R
