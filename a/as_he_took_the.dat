5|$|The castle's {{design was}} unsatisfactory, as its guns {{could not be}} angled so to fire down into the harbour, and its defences were {{considered}} vulnerable to attack. To mitigate this, an additional blockhouse was probably constructed below, closer to the water, but eventually a new fortification, the Star Castle, was built instead on the neighbouring island of St Mary's, which became the main fort in the Scilly Isles. In {{the aftermath of the}} English Civil War, the Scilly Isles were held by the Royalist sympathisers of King Charles I, who gave the castle its current name. The islands were then attacked by a Parliamentary force led by Sir Robert Blake in 1651, who landed on Tresco but bypassed the fort <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> island. Its Royalist defenders blew up parts of the castle as they left, and some of its stone appears to have been used to build the newer Cromwell's Castle by the harbour.|$|E

25|$|Clark's {{full-time}} call up to {{the national}} team in 200607 also saw him play fewer matches in the 200607 domestic season, yet the three matches he played saw him take 21 wickets at 14.47. During this season, Clark recorded his highest ever first-class score with 62 off 43 balls against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. Clark bought up his half-century off 34 balls and his innings included 4 sixes and 3 fours. In the same match, Clark claimed his best ever first-class figures at the time, taking 6/39 in South Australia's second innings. In the next match he played for New South Wales, Clark exceeded these figures by taking 8/58 against Western Australia at the WACA Ground. Clark ended up taking 10 wickets for the match, and his first innings figures included a hat-trick, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> wickets of Marcus North, Adam Voges and Steve Magoffin in successive deliveries to reduce Western Australia to 4/2.|$|E
25|$|Dario Frigo {{took the}} lead in the 2001 Giro d'Italia after the race's fourth stage.

Frigo gained some time back in the stage fifteen time trial, but it wasn't enough to ovecome Simoni's lead. Simoni {{went on to win the}} Giro d'Italia by a wide margin after Frigo's withdrawal. Stefano Garzelli took the early lead after winning the 2002 Giro d'Italia's second stage, but soon tested positive for probenecidnbsp&– a banned substancenbsp&– and was forced to leave the Giro.

25|$|In {{the next}} race, the Austrian Grand Prix, Montoya finally outpaced his {{teammate}} Ralf Schumacher in qualifying {{and took a}} career-best second. It looked better and better for him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> lead at the start and pulled away, with second-placed Ralf holding up a string of five cars behind him. But, after 10 laps, Schumacher retired with brake failure. Montoya was struggling with the same problems, and Schumacher {{had been told to}} hold the others up so that Montoya could build a gap. With Ralf Schumacher out, the five drivers, led by Michael Schumacher began to close on Montoya at over a second a lap. Soon Schumacher was right on Montoya's tail and tried to pass him around the outside at Remus Curve. Montoya kept on the inside, braked late, locked {{up and went to the}} gravel. Schumacher was also forced to go to the gravel to avoid Montoya. Montoya rejoined seventh, just behind Schumacher. Montoya went for an early stop which solved his problems. He was set for one point in sixth until he stopped on the track with a hydraulic failure. After the race, Schumacher said that 'all Montoya was doing was to try to take Schumacher out with himself off the circuit'.|$|E

25|$|North Carolina {{was playing}} looking for its 4th National Championship while Illinois {{was playing in}} its first National Championship. It was a tight contest {{for much of the}} first half before an 8-0 run by North Carolina allowed them to take a 35-25 lead. Eventually they would take a 40-27 lead into halftime. North Carolina {{increased}} its lead to 15 {{at one point in the}} second half. But Illinois began a furious charge. At one point, they would hit seven consecutive shots from the floor to turn a fifteen-point lead back to four. Unfazed, North Carolina would push the lead back up to ten before a 10-0 run by the Illini tied the game at 65-65. Illinois would tie the game at 70-70 on a three by Luther Head. But North Carolina would fight back as freshman Marvin Williams tapped back a Rashad McCants missed shot to put North Carolina back in front. Illinois would get several cracks to take the lead but were unable to convert. Eventually, Raymond Felton was able to steal the ball from Head forcing Deron Williams to foul. However, Felton converted on 1 of 2 free throws giving Illinois one last chance. But Luther Head's three pointer bounced high and out. Eventually it went into the hands of Felton who this time connected on both free throws to give North Carolina a 75-70 victory. For North Carolina head coach Roy Williams, it was his first national championship. Illinois was denied a chance to set the NCAA record for most wins in a season, instead tying it at 37. Sean May scored 26 points <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> MOP of the Final Four.|$|E
25|$|However, {{after the}} second half began, the game took on a {{different}} complexion as Dublin seized the lead by scoring three consecutive points. However, Mayo reclaimed the lead early into the half as Lee Keegan scored a goal to put his team one point ahead. The talking point of the match occurred in the 48th minute, as Dublin's John Small, who had previously received a yellow card in the first half, was sent off for a foul on Colm Boyle. However, Donal Vaughan of Mayo was also sent off after striking Small in the face {{in retaliation for the}} foul. This left both teams reduced to fourteen men for the remaining duration of the game. After seventy minutes of the game had elapsed, the teams were tied at 1-16 apiece, and it appeared that the game was destined for a draw and replay. In the seventy-first minute, Mayo were awarded a kickable free and an opportunity to go ahead. Cillian O'Connor, who had missed a free under a similar scenario in the previous final, took the kick, and missed, having it strike the post and rebound away from goal. Ciarán Kilkenny was given a black card by the referee for cynical play. Then, with a mere minute of the six additional minutes remaining, Diarmuid Connolly was fouled approximately forty-five metres from the Mayo goal, leaving Dublin with a kick to win the game. Dean Rock, the son of Barney Rock, {{one of the most famous}} Gaelic footballers from the capital, took the free. Lee Keegan controversially threw a GPS device at Rock <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> free, yet the Dubliner was undeterred and converted. This left the defending champions one point ahead, and after reclaiming the ball from the Mayo kick-out, Dublin maintained possession until the final whistle was blown. Stephen Cluxton, the Dublin captain, then lifted the Sam Maguire Cup for the fifth time in seven years.|$|E
