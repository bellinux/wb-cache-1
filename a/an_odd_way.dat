I was her great reality, often the only liaison agent who could make the world tangible to her.|$|E
5|$|As {{the years}} pass, the rural area {{gives way to}} a more {{urbanized}} setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the farmers are pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with their mates are replaced by promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt Tod, and in <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> he looks forward {{to it as the}} only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E

500|$|Many {{reviewer}}s {{commented that}} the dark tone of the final episode {{was typical of the}} series. A reviewer for BBC Comedy said that it [...] "was a characteristically dark end to a show which was never afraid to explore the flip side of the comedy coin."

[...] In June 2009, Silberling confirmed he still talked about the project with Handler, and suggested the sequel be a stop motion film because the lead actors have grown too old.

500|$|On September 6, 1956, Raymond {{was killed}} in an {{automobile}} accident in Westport, Connecticut. Driving fellow cartoonist Stan Drake's 1956 Corvette at twice the [...] speed limit, he hit a tree and was killed. Roberts describes in his biography the circumstances {{as a result of the}} weather. Driving in the convertible with its top down, Raymond decided to reach his destination quicker rather than stop to put the top back up when rain started to fall. Drake was thrown clear of the crash, but Raymond, with his seat belt buckled, died instantly. Speculation surrounds the nature of his death, with some, Drake included, believing Raymond was suicidal. Raymond had been involved in four automobile accidents in the month prior to his death, which led Drake to say Raymond [...] "had been trying to kill himself". Author Arlen Schumer ascribes the motive for suicide as being related to Raymond's personal life. Schumer alleges that Raymond had been having affairs, and that his wife was refusing to grant him a divorce. R. C. Harvey is dismissive of this motivation: [...] "Committing suicide strikes me as <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> for a man of Raymond's sophistication to react to his disappointment in romance". Harvey also notes that no mention of any alleged affairs is made in Tom Robert's biography, [...] "probably out of consideration to Raymond's surviving family". Drake has also been quoted as speculating that Raymond [...] "hit the accelerator by mistake" [...] instead of the brake. Raymond is buried in St. John's Roman Catholic Cemetery in Darien, Connecticut.|$|E
2500|$|Claudia Setzer, who {{believes}} in the authenticity of a kernel in the Testimonium, states that while [...] "tribe is <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> to describe Christians" [...] {{it does not necessarily}} have negative connotations. Setzer argues for the existence of an authentic kernel because [...] "the style and vocabulary are Josephan" [...] and specific parts (e.g. the use of [...] "wise man") are not what one would expect from a Christian forger. Setzer argues that the Testimonium indicates that Josephus had heard of Jesus and the basic elements surrounding his death, and that he saw Jesus as primarily a miracle worker. Van Voorst also states that calling Christians a [...] "tribe" [...] would have been very out of character for a Christian scribe, while Josephus has used it to refer both to Jewish and Christian groups.|$|E

The Act allows the Minister of the Environment discretion to prohibit certain substances from time to time, which Lamer finds to be <b>a</b> very <b>odd</b> <b>way</b> of enacting criminal law. As well, the provinces can be exempt from the Act if they have regulated their own similar law, even though provinces cannot enact criminal law.|$|R
