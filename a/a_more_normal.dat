Maggie Roswell was assigned to voice the character and she originally based it on Milhouse, who is voiced by Pamela Hayden. The producers felt that her impression sounded out of place so she ended up using <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>normal</b> sounding voice. It was Gewirtz who in this episode gave Milhouse his last name, Van Houten, which he got {{from one of his}} wife's friends.|$|E

25|$|Since it was rerouted in {{the late}} 1920s, the river has been {{little more than a}} {{drainage}} ditch within a floodplain for several miles above and below downtown Dallas, with <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>normal</b> course further upstream and downstream, but as Dallas began shifting towards postindustrial society, public outcry about the lack of aesthetic and recreational use of the river ultimately gave way to the Trinity River Project, which was begun in the early 2000s and was scheduled to be completed in the 2010s. If the project materializes fully, it promises improvements to the riverfront in the form of man-made lakes, new park facilities and trails, and transportation upgrades.|$|E
25|$|As {{the launch}} {{customer}} of extended Q400, SAS {{was prone to}} many of the early faults with the aircraft type. Aviation historian Åke Hall stated that it was the aircraft type which SAS has had the most challenges with throughout its history. First of all the production was delayed and by May only four of eleven planned deliveries had been made. One issue was false alarms created by the cockpit software, while oil leaks caused for engines to have to be replaced. By October there had been nine emergency landings caused by various technical faults, and SAS Commuter chose to ground the aircraft for several days. Deliveries came to a halt that month as the eleven first aircraft were all having faults caused by the same defects. Delivery of further aircraft resumed in February 2001. As the various issues were resolved, the aircraft entered <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>normal</b> mode of operation. The 28th aircraft was delivered in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Heat stroke {{can occur}} in dogs, {{especially}} in flat-faced breeds such as the Bulldog or in giant breeds. Breed, lack of water, exercise, and high ambient temperature predispose dogs to heat stroke. Signs include vomiting, diarrhea, collapse, difficulty breathing, and body temperature approaching 42°C to 43°C. Treatment includes cooling the dogs with wet towels and fans, intravenous fluid therapy, and other supportive care. If a dog's temperature begin to drop to around 40°C, stop the cooling process. Once a dog’s body begins to cool, it can drop quickly and getting them too cool can create different problems. Allow the dog {{only a couple of}} laps of water until their temperature begins to drop to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>normal</b> level. Do not allow a dog to gulp large quantities of water. If a dog is panting excessively and then drinks a lot of water, he will swallow large amounts of air with the water and this can cause an equally life-threatening case of gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat) in their stomach.|$|E

25|$|In the USA, corneal transplants (also {{known as}} corneal grafts) for {{keratoconus}} are usually performed under sedation as outpatient surgery. In other countries, such as Australia and the UK, {{the operation is}} commonly performed with the person undergoing a general anaesthetic. All cases require a careful follow-up with an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) {{for a number of}} years. Frequently, vision is greatly improved after the surgery, but even if the actual visual acuity does not improve, because the cornea is <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>normal</b> shape after the healing is completed, people can more easily be fitted with corrective lenses. Complications of corneal transplants are mostly related to vascularization of the corneal tissue and rejection of the donor cornea. Vision loss is very rare, though difficult-to-correct vision is possible. When rejection is severe, repeat transplants are often attempted, and are frequently successful. Keratoconus will not normally reoccur in the transplanted cornea; incidences of this have been observed, but are usually attributed to incomplete excision of the original cornea or inadequate screening of the donor tissue. The long-term outlook for corneal transplants performed for keratoconus is usually favorable once the initial healing period is completed and a few years have elapsed without problems.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the {{rarity of}} the disease, it's {{difficult}} to reliably estimate statistics. However, a 2006 study which followed 7 cases over {{an average of}} 8.5 years noted that [...] "In general, cherubism {{does not have a}} poor prognosis.

[...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger called the episode [...] "not an instant classic, but a solid start to the season". Sepinwall said it started slowly, but gradually built to a [...] "very funny, and kinda sweet climax in the conference room". New York magazine writer Will Leitch said [...] "Gossip" [...] appeared to be a return to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>normal</b> Office atmosphere, compared to the surprises and twists of the fifth season. Rick Ingebritson of The Palm Beach Post said he was concerned the season premiere would not be good because Steve Carell, John Krasinski and Ed Helms would be too distracted with their growing film careers. But, he said, [...] "Thankfully, if Thursday's premiere was any indication, it appears that the Dunder Mifflin crew still has a lot to offer." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons said, [...] "'Gossip' had some terrific moments, but I don't know that I'd put it on my all-time great episodes list."

500|$|The {{shell of}} the spiny scallop is {{slightly}} shaped like a fan {{and is able to}} grow to a height of about [...] though <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>normal</b> adult size is [...] The shell is composed of two valves, each of which is convex and has a small number of broad ribs covered with blunt spines. These radiate from the umbone, the rounded protuberance near the hinge, and between them are fine etched striations. The background colour is white with radial bands of pale purple and the right valve, which is usually underneath, is paler than the left. The annual growth rings are visible, often as concentric bands of a different hue. Beside the hinge are two irregular shell flaps or auricles with the anterior one normally being much larger than the other. This provides an attachment for the single strong adductor muscle that closes the shell. On either side of the long hinge there are some little ridges and grooves known as teeth. Their function is to prevent the valves moving sideways with regard to each other. Some bivalve shells have large [...] "cardinal" [...] teeth on the hinge immediately below the umbone, but the spiny scallop does not. Instead it has 5 or 6 lateral teeth lying {{on either side of the}} hinge. Lining the inside of the valves is the mantle, a membrane that covers the gut and other internal organs. It can be seen round the margins of the valves as a thick layer like a sandwich filling. It is fringed with numerous short tentacles and there is a row of tiny simple eyes close to each of the valves. The animal usually lies on its right valve and its exposed, left valve often has a colonial sponge growing on it.|$|E
2500|$|As a noun or a verb, {{the word}} primal denotes the reliving {{of an early}} painful feeling. A {{complete}} primal has been found, according to Janov and Holden, to be marked by a [...] "pre-primal" [...] rise in vital signs such as pulse, core body temperature, and blood pressure {{leading up to the}} feeling experience and then a falling off of those vital signs to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>normal</b> level than where they began.

2500|$|Prefabrication of the hulls began {{even before}} the final design was {{approved}} and {{proved to be a}} major mistake as the strength analysis of the longitudinal joints in the hull proved to be severely flawed and construction was suspended until the end of November 1927 when new blueprints were issued. No slipways were available at the Zhandov Yard until three were finished in May 1928, having only begun construction at the end of 1927, and the assembly of the hulls of the first three Series I ships began shortly afterwards.

2500|$|Buffy {{returned}} in Joss Whedon's television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, this time played by Sarah Michelle Gellar {{for all of}} the show's 144 episodes. In season one (1997), Buffy begins to accept the responsibilities and dangers of her calling as the Slayer after moving to the small California town of Sunnydale. She becomes best friends with Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) and Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan), and meets her new Watcher, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head). Together, they form the Scooby Gang, and work together to battle various supernatural occurrences which plague Sunnydale High. In the season finale, Buffy battles the vampiric villain known as the Master (Mark Metcalf), and is drowned in the process. She is resuscitated by Xander and rises to defeat the vampire lord. In the show's second season (1997–1998), Buffy continues {{to come to terms with}} her destiny, finds forbidden love with benevolent vampire Angel (David Boreanaz), and clashes with new villains Spike (James Marsters) and Drusilla (Juliet Landau). She also meets her Slayer replacement, Kendra (Bianca Lawson), who was called when Buffy was killed by the Master. Kendra is later killed by Drusilla, and the next replacement is seen in season 3. In the episode [...] "Surprise", Buffy loses her virginity to Angel, an event which triggers the loss of his soul and unleashes his sadistic alter-ego, Angelus. Angelus proceeds to subject the characters to mental and physical torture for the remainder of the season. In the final episode of season two, Buffy is forced to reveal her identity as the Slayer to her mother (Kristine Sutherland), and send the newly good Angel to hell in order to save the world. She then leaves Sunnydale for Los Angeles in the hopes of escaping her life as the Slayer. Season three (1998–1999) sees Buffy reconnect to her calling, her friends, and her family after her departure, as well as make difficult life decisions regarding her relationship with the resurrected Angel. She must also deal with the introduction of rebellious new Slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku), who becomes increasingly destructive and disloyal over the course of the season. In the season finale, Buffy stabs Faith in an attempt to save Angel's life, and leads her classmates into a climactic battle against the demonic Mayor of Sunnydale (Harry Groener). Angel then leaves Sunnydale in hopes that Buffy can have <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>normal</b> life without him.|$|E

6000|$|It is a {{very rare}} thing anywhere, {{especially}} in England, for a man deliberately to choose poetry as the duty of his life, and to remain loyal, as a consequence, to the bride of St Francis--Poverty. This loyalty Tennyson maintained, even under the temptation {{to make money in}} recognised ways presented by his new-born love for his future wife, Miss Emily Sellwood. They had first met in 1830, when she, a girl of seventeen, seemed to him like [...] "a Dryad or an Oread wandering here." [...] But admiration became the affection of a lifetime when Tennyson met Miss Sellwood as bridesmaid to her sister, the bride of his brother Charles, in 1836. The poet could not afford to marry, and, like the hero of Locksley Hall, he may have asked himself, [...] "What is that which I should do?" [...] By 1840 he had done nothing tangible and lucrative, and correspondence between the lovers was forbidden. That neither dreamed of Tennyson's deserting poetry for <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>normal</b> profession proved of great benefit to the world. The course is one which could only be justified by the absolute certainty of possessing genius.|$|E
60|$|Nerving {{himself to}} <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>normal</b> mood, he paused {{under one of}} the dark dragon trees that {{branched}} out above him, and, taking out his torch, turned {{in the direction of the}} door at the back of the temple. It was unbolted as before, and the thought stirred faintly in him that it was slightly open, though only by a crack. The more he thought of it, however, the more certain he grew that this was but one of the common illusions of light coming from a different angle. He studied in a more scientific spirit the details of the door, with its rusty bolts and hinges, when he became conscious of something very near him--indeed, nearly above his head. Something was dangling from the tree that was not a broken branch. For some seconds he stood as still as a stone, and as cold. What he saw above him were the legs of a man hanging, presumably a dead man hanged. But the next moment he knew better. The man was literally alive and kicking; and an instant after he had dropped to the ground and turned on the intruder. Simultaneously three or four other trees seemed to come to life in the same fashion. Five or six other figures had fallen on their feet from these unnatural nests. It was as if the place were an island of monkeys. But a moment after they had made a stampede toward him, and when they laid their hands on him he knew that they were men.|$|E
