5|$|Culturally, Black Sabbath have exerted a huge {{influence}} in both television and literature and have {{in many cases}} become synonymous with heavy metal. In the film Almost Famous, Lester Bangs gives the protagonist <b>an</b> <b>assignment</b> to cover the band (plot point one) with the immortal line: 'Give me 500 words on Black Sabbath'.

For {{all of the new}} superheavy element isotopes observed in 48 Ca irradiations of actinide targets, this correlation technique has not been possible, because the α-decay chains end in spontaneous fission of previously unknown isotopes. Consequently, Z and <b>A</b> <b>assignments</b> have been made by less-direct means.

40|$|Purpose – This study aims {{to explore}} how the motivational {{construct}} of intrinsic motivation for <b>an</b> international <b>assignment</b> relates to variables of interest in international expatriation research. Design/methodology/approach – Questionnaire data from 331 employed business school alumni of a high-ranking Canadian MBA program was analyzed. The sample consisted of respondents {{from a wide variety}} of industries and occupations, with more than half of them in marketing, administration or engineering. Findings – Higher intrinsic motivation for <b>an</b> international <b>assignment</b> was associated with greater willingness to accept <b>an</b> international <b>assignment</b> and to communicate in a foreign language. Externally driven motivation for <b>an</b> international <b>assignment</b> was associated with perceiving more difficulties associated with <b>an</b> international <b>assignment.</b> Intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for <b>an</b> international <b>assignment</b> were, however, associated with comparable reactions to organizational support. Originality/value – Drawing from self-determination theory, this study explores the distinction between authentic versus externally controlled motivations for <b>an</b> international <b>assignment.</b> It underscores the need to pay more attention to motivational constructs in selecting, coaching, and training individuals for international expatriation <b>assignments.</b> It extends <b>a</b> rich tradition of research in the area of motivation to the international assignment arena.

50|$|These {{algorithms}} {{can further}} {{be classified as}} hard or soft clustering algorithms. Hard clustering computes <b>a</b> hard <b>assignment</b> - each document {{is a member of}} exactly one cluster. The assignment of soft clustering algorithms is soft - <b>a</b> document’s <b>assignment</b> is <b>a</b> distribution over all clusters. In <b>a</b> soft <b>assignment,</b> <b>a</b> document has fractional membership in several clusters. Dimensionality reduction methods can be considered a subtype of soft clustering; for documents, these include latent semantic indexing (truncated singular value decomposition on term histograms) and topic models.|$|R

5|$|A {{cellular}} automaton {{consists of an}} array of cells, each one of which has {{a finite number of}} possible states, together with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based only on the states of neighboring cells. A configuration of a {{cellular automaton}} is <b>an</b> <b>assignment</b> of a state to every cell of the automaton; the update rule of a cellular automaton forms a function from configurations to configurations, with the requirement that the updated value of any cell depends only on some finite neighborhood of the cell, and that the function is invariant under translations of the input array.|$|E
5|$|A k-coloring, {{for some}} integer k, is <b>an</b> <b>assignment</b> {{of one of}} k colors to each vertex of a graph G such that the {{endpoints}} of each edge get different colors. The k-colorings of G correspond exactly to homomorphisms from G to the complete graph K'k. Indeed, the vertices of K'k correspond to the k colors, and two colors are adjacent as vertices of K'k if {{and if they are}} different. Hence a function defines a homomorphism to K'k if and only if it maps adjacent vertices of G to different colors (i.e., it is a k-coloring). In particular, G is k-colorable if and only if it is K'k-colorable.|$|E

In spring training, Zito competed for a role on the Athletics' 25-man roster, possibly as a long reliever. On April 4, 2015, Zito accepted <b>an</b> <b>assignment</b> to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. Zito's Nashville teammates lauded him for embracing the Triple-A lifestyle and for his commitment to the team: charting pitches between starts, coaching first base, and even buying dinner for the entire team on his birthday. Zito spent the entire season with Nashville, including about a month on the disabled list with left shoulder tendinitis. He was activated on the next-to-last day of the season on which he pitched one scoreless inning of relief. In a total of 24appearances (22 starts), he accrued an 8–7 record with a 3.46 ERA and 91 strikeouts.|$|E

In 1853, when missionary work began to take a toll on his health, Cleveland's father took <b>an</b> <b>assignment</b> in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica) and the family moved again.
