5|$|Between 1788 and 1789, the Minister-Plenipotentiary of the Austrian Netherlands {{decided that}} the only way in which reform could be {{provoked}} would be by rapid and uncompromising enforcement. Some states had <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> refuse payment of taxes to the Austrian authorities. The Joyous Entry was officially annulled and the Estates of Hainaut and Brabant were disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The archaeological {{excavation}} into Borobudur during reconstruction {{suggests that}} adherents of Hinduism or a pre-Indic faith had <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> erect a large structure on Borobudur's hill before {{the site was}} appropriated by Buddhists. The foundations are unlike any Hindu or Buddhist shrine structures, and therefore, the initial structure is considered more indigenous Javanese than Hindu or Buddhist.|$|E
5|$|In June 2013, Megadeth {{released}} its fourteenth studio album, Super Collider, to mixed critical reaction. In the {{months following the}} album's release, frontman and guitarist Dave Mustaine revealed {{that he and the}} rest of the band had <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> discuss a follow-up, an urgency somewhat influenced by the then-recent death of Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman, which had reportedly given Mustaine a sense of mortality.|$|E

5|$|By the 1830s {{the species}} was in {{cultivation}} in continental Europe. It was recorded as being cultivated {{in the garden}} of Karl von Hügel in Vienna, Austria in 1831, and in 1833 it was listed amongst the rare plants that had been introduced into Belgium. Along with several hundred other native Australian plants it was exhibited at plant shows held at Utrecht and Haarlem in the Netherlands in the 1840s and 1850s. By this time, however, English gardeners had <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> lose interest in the Proteaceae, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century European interest in the cultivation of Proteaceae was virtually non-existent.|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{reached its}} peak {{intensity}} of 65mph (100km/h) around 8 a.m. (EDT) as it continued to become more organized. However, there were indications that it had <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> weaken. Outflow towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm, a sign that dry air was entering the system. During the afternoon hours, the structure of Josephine began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll. By the late night, the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center.|$|E
5|$|On August 1, 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{sent the}} invading Iraqi forces into {{neighboring}} Kuwait, a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq {{as part of}} its territory. This invasion sparked the initiation of the Persian Gulf War and it brought worldwide condemnation. An estimated 140,000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City and moved on to the Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border. The United States had <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the U.S. Central Command, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, because of its important petroleum reserves.|$|E

5|$|Other {{artists of}} the period had <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> {{experiment}} with alternative methods of depicting Hope in art. Some, such as the upcoming young painter Evelyn De Morgan, drew on the imagery of Psalm 137 and its description of exiled musicians refusing to play for their captors. Meanwhile, Edward Burne-Jones, a friend of Watts who specialised in painting mythological and allegorical topics, in 1871 completed the cartoon for a planned stained glass window depicting Hope for St Margaret's Church in Hopton-on-Sea. Burne-Jones's design showed Hope upright and defiant in a prison cell, holding a flowering rod.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Air Force had <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> up {{the ante}} in its anti-infiltration campaigns by unleashing B-52 Stratofortress bombers against the trail in December 1965. From April through June 1966 there were 400 B-52 anti-infiltration sorties against the system. The PAVN countered this effort by concentrating more {{anti-aircraft}} artillery weapons within its logistical network. Between 1964 {{and the end of}} 1967 there were 103,148 tactical air sorties launched against the trail, including 1,718 B-52 strikes. During the same timeframe 132 U.S. aircraft or helicopters were shot down over Laos.|$|E
5|$|Dallas and Fort Worth {{experienced}} one {{of their}} greatest oil-related construction booms in 1930 and 1931, when {{the opening of the}} East Texas oil field helped establish Dallas as the financial center for the oil industry in Texas and Oklahoma. New business offices and municipal buildings appeared in the city, including the Highland Park Village shopping center, one of the nation's earliest shopping malls. The Depression slowed population growth in the Dallas area somewhat during the later 1930s, but rapid growth patterns returned again during the 1940s. By this time, though, Dallas had <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> rediversify, becoming a center for aircraft manufacturing and electronics technology in addition to a variety of other industries.|$|E

5|$|Designed for {{overseas}} service protecting Germany's maritime trade, Hansa {{spent the first}} nine years of her career abroad. In 1884, {{it was found that}} her hull was badly corroded; this stemmed from the lengthy construction period, during which the iron had <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> corrode. As a result of the poor shape of her hull, Hansa was removed from active service in 1884 and used as a guard ship in Kiel. While in Kiel, she was also used as a training ship for engine-room personnel and stokers. She was formally stricken from the naval register on 6 August 1888. She was then used as a floating barracks in Kiel, until 1905. Hansa was then moved to Mönkeberg, hulked, and used to train stokers. The ship did not last long in this service, and was sold in March 1906 for 96,000marks. Hansa was broken up later that year in Swinemünde.|$|E
5|$|In 1785 {{the castle}} {{was bought by}} the Oxford County Justices and {{rebuilding}} began under the London architect William Blackburn. The wider castle site had <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> change by the late 18th century, with New Road being built through the bailey and the last parts of the castle moat being filled in to allow {{the building of the}} new Oxford Canal terminus. Building the new prison included demolishing the old college attached to St George's chapel and repositioning part of the crypt in 1794. The work was completed under Daniel Harris in 1805. Harris gained a reasonable salary as the new governor and used convict labour from the prison to conduct early archaeological excavations at the castle {{with the help of the}} antiquarian Edward King.|$|E
5|$|In March 1971 South Vietnamese forces, {{supported}} by U.S. air power, launched Operation Lam Son 719, the long-awaited offensive {{to cut the}} Ho Chi Minh trail in southeastern Laos. However, {{the result was a}} failure. North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces had <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> expand the trail system westward, pushing Royal Lao forces toward the Mekong, slowly extending the territory it controlled, moving west of the trail and creating a larger buffer zone between its logistical system and the South Vietnamese. After Lam Son 719, that process accelerated. Hanoi's effort was simplified {{by the fact that the}} Royalist forces in the south had little experience fighting PAVN and they were quickly overwhelmed. Inept and ineffective were terms utilized to describe their defense. On 30 April 1971 the key town of Attopeu was seized by the communists.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Wallingford, Stephen and Henry spoke together privately about a potential end to the war; Stephen's son Eustace, however, was furious about the peaceful outcome at Wallingford. He left his father and returned home to Cambridge to gather more funds for a fresh campaign, where he fell ill and died the next month. Eustace's death removed an obvious claimant to the throne and was politically convenient for those seeking a permanent peace in England. It is possible, however, that Stephen had <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> consider passing over Eustace's claim; historian Edmund King observes that Eustace's claim to the throne was {{not mentioned in the}} discussions at Wallingford, for example, and this may have added to Stephen's son's anger.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} afternoon, an eye feature began to form; subsequently, Hernan was nearing {{hurricane}} status. However, by the nighttime hours, a microwave satellite {{found that the}} center of Hernan was located to the west-southwest of the eye feature, and the intensification ceased {{for the rest of}} the day and into the morning of August 8. Later in the morning, the center of Hernan was determined to be located underneath the eye and was determined to have become a hurricane, the fifth of the season, during the afternoon of August 8. Throughout the day, the eye became better defined, indicating that moderate northeasterly wind shear had <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> diminish. Despite a cloud-filled eye, meteorologists showed Hernan peaking as a category 2 hurricane overnight.|$|E
5|$|The Celtic Church is a {{term that}} has been used by {{scholars}} to describe a specific form of Christianity with its origins in the conversion of Ireland, traditionally associated with St. Patrick. This form of Christianity later spread to northern Britain through Iona. It is also used as a general description for the Christian establishment of northern Britain prior to the twelfth century, when new religious institutions and ideologies of primarily French origin began to take root in Scotland. The Celtic form of Christianity has been contrasted with that derived from missions from Rome, which reached southern England in 587 under the leadership of St. Augustine of Canterbury. Subsequent missions from Canterbury then helped convert the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, reaching Northumbria in the early eighth century, where Iona had <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> have a presence. As a result, Christianity in Northumbria became a mix of Celtic and Roman influences.|$|E

5|$|The Fat Duck {{is located}} in a 16th-century cottage that was further {{modified}} in the 19th and 20th centuries. Prior to the restaurant opening in the location, it was a public house called The Ringers. The building was Grade II listed by English Heritage on 2 May 1989. When the restaurant opened in 1995, the kitchen was staffed by owner Heston Blumenthal and one other employee. At the time the restaurant was serving meals in the style of a French bistro, such as lemon tarts, and steak and chips. Blumenthal later said that science had <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> influence the cooking at this early stage, as already on the menu were his Triple Cooked Chips, which were developed to stop the potato from going soft.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} an {{intermediary}} title was developed after director Tetsuya Nomura {{and his team}} had <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> develop ideas for the second Kingdom Hearts game, which he had intended to be set {{a year after the}} original. Originally titled Kingdom Hearts: Lost Memories, Nomura changed the name to match the overall outline of the story, while still reflecting the theme of memories. Chain of Memories was developed {{to bridge the gap between}} Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II. Like most sequels, Kingdom Hearts II was planned to have the character start from the beginning, ability-wise. To explain the loss of abilities gained in the previous game, Nomura had the story revolve around Sora's memories getting corrupted and implemented the card battle system to symbolize Sora's various memories.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the gold rush on the Native peoples of the region was considerable. The Tlingit and the Koyukon peoples prospered {{in the short term}} from their work as guides, packers and from selling food and {{supplies}} to the prospectors. In the longer term, however, especially the Hän people living in the Klondike region suffered from the environmental damage of the gold mining on the rivers and forests. Their population had <b>already</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> decline after the discovery of gold along Fortymile River in the 1880s but dropped catastrophically after their move to the reserve, a result of the contaminated water supply and smallpox. The Hän found only few ways to benefit economically from the gold rush and their fishing and hunting grounds were largely destroyed; by 1904 they needed aid from the NWMP to prevent famine.|$|E
