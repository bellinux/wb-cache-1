5|$|We {{went into}} the booth to record the song. She {{originally}} {{wanted to do a}} Mike Skinner thing, rapping the verse and singing the chorus. But I asked her to sing it all, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>just</b> made up the whole melody on the spot, and sang this amazing solo. At that moment I realised that this girl has a really special gift.|$|E
5|$|Sia {{is one of}} them. She comes in, singer-songwriter, {{she just}} writes the most {{beautiful}} amazing ballads. Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>just</b> writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna be such a serious person, and I'm nervous to meet her, and I just want her to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.|$|E

Later, Gaga recorded the song as a collaboration with Beyoncé for The Fame Monster. Gaga said, [...] "I wrote {{it for her}} [...] {{a long time ago}} <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>just</b> didn't use it for her album. It's fine because I love the song and I get to perform it now." [...] Spears' demo for the song leaked in May 2010. Additionally, the guest vocalist {{was originally}} going to be Spears, but ultimately Gaga made Beyoncé the featured vocalist instead. The main inspiration behind the song was Gaga's fear of suffocation as she felt that she seldom found time to just let loose and have fun.|$|E

Schipp revealed that there was [...] "intense speculation" [...] about how the writers would get around the fact that Charlie died on-screen in January. Of her return, Anderson explained [...] "I told my mum and dad that I was coming back, and they almost fell off their chairs. They said: 'Hang on, didn't Charlie die?' It's hilarious, because this time twelve months ago I was keeping it the biggest secret from everyone as to whether Charlie would live or die, and now I'm {{in the same boat}} again as far as not giving anything away." [...] The actress added that the return storyline was outlined {{a couple of months ago}} <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>just</b> knew that she wanted to do it. Charlie returned on 17 June 2013.|$|E

500|$|Kyla was {{involved}} in three romantic relationships during her time in the show, {{the first of which}} was with physiotherapist Justin Fuller (Ben Richards). Ayola said of the relationship: [...] "She hasn't got great taste in men! She likes good-looking blokes - that whole 'take me to a cave' thing - but she doesn't check that there is a soft, gentle, sensitive side to him. He's gorgeous to look at, but she hasn't learned that you have to look a bit deeper." [...] Roger Griffiths was cast as Kyla's ex-husband Harvey. Ayola commented on their previous relationship: [...] "I think they split up because Kyla is so volatile. The more we learn about Harvey the more I think he might not be the reason for their split". She expanded: [...] "They had a tempestuous relationship and Kyla is very irrational which got too much for Harvey. Harvey brings out the worst in Kyla <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>just</b> ends up yelling at him. It's a very difficult and if he knew how to handle her maybe it could work out but he doesn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Jennifer Lee {{strongly}} {{believed that}} there couldn't be any other Anna but Kristen Bell, saying, [...] "It was definitely a wonderful surprise hearing her voice , not knowing {{that she had been}} classically trained. Also, she had such a warm, sweet voice. She was everything that we could've hoped for Anna." [...] Co-director Chris Buck shared Lee's ideas, commenting, [...] "Kristen Bell for Anna was the very first person that we saw. We did a lot of casting to find Anna, but she just hit it out of the park. From the beginning we loved her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>just</b> kind of became Anna and Anna became her. I don't know which one is which." [...] Idina Menzel was also surprised by her co-star's singing ability, stating that, [...] "I didn't know how great a singer she was. I quickly found out and need to constantly tell her because she doesn't tell anybody else! She's always playing it down." [...] Songwriter Kristen Anderson-Lopez later commended Bell's quick comprehension of her ideas, saying that she would collaborate with the actress for [...] "the rest of [...] life" [...] if she could. Anna's animator Becky Bresee commented that Bell's voice [...] "lends itself well, so you are taking bits and pieces." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{workplace}} flirtation between Will and Emma, Gilsig deemed Terri [...] "a woman of conviction", {{willing to do}} [...] "whatever it takes" [...] to keep Will from leaving her, [...] "even if that means finding this woman and hunting her down". She explained that Will and Terri's communication is weak and that Terri is [...] "missing {{a lot of the}} skills for the marriage", and commented that Terri feels threatened by Will's commitment to the glee club, worried that it will pull him away from her. Gilsig characterized Terri as emotionally still being in high school, and explained: [...] "I think Terri still lives in that world, where I can move the pieces in such a way to create a picture, and that will make it real. I don't think she's learned that you can actually just have open conversations and talk about your fears and ask for your needs to be met in a direct, compassionate way. I think she's still in high school and thinking whatever you do, just don't let anybody know that you don't know what you're doing." [...] Discussing Terri's relationship with her sister Kendra, Gilsig commented: [...] "When Kendra tells Terri to do something, Terri does it. As crazy as Terri might be, she's actually pretty normal in the face of her sister. This [...] is Kendra's brainchild, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>just</b> trusts her implicitly." ...|$|E

Mercedes realised {{that she will}} be blamed for stalking Mitzeee so she stabbed herself to convince people Mitzeee was mad. Metcalfe said the situation was born through [...] "pure desperation". She said that [...] "the thought of Mitzeee, Riley and Bobby as a family together was too much for her to take, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>just</b> saw red. I don't think it's something that Mercedes thought about or planned - she wouldn't have even dreamed of doing it to herself. But at the time, she saw it as the only way out of the situation". Shenton explained that Mitzeee was worried due to the stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine, which as she states [...] "isn't a great combination." [...] Shenton revealed that Mercedes arrived to see Mitzee who [...] "still has no idea who the stalker really is, but as they're talking, Mercedes says something that makes Mitzeee discover the truth - and she's totally shocked. Mitzeee is petrified and picks up a knife in the kitchen. The next thing you know, Mitzeee wakes up after being unconscious [...] The first thing she sees is Mercedes with a stab wound and there is blood everywhere.
