50|$|The women’s {{personal}} allowance {{was the same}} as the men’s, $5 per month for personal needs in exchange for 56 - 70 hrs work per month on camp work projects. No remittance was sent back home unlike the CCC men’s allowance. The camps were located where a facility had heat, lighting and sanitary conveniences: typically summer hotels, abandoned CCC camps and vacated schools. They were administered by female camp directors, project supervisors, staff teachers and counselors. The average camp had around 100 women, with a supervisory staff of 10-20 including cooks and a nurse. Each enrollee was assigned fixed hours of work on camp assignments, including working in forest nurseries at some camps. Others were making and repairing toys and playground equipment, while some worked at creating visual training aids for public schools. Those with visual disabilities (there were camps for the blind) would make finished bedding or use natural materials to create woven products. Sewing equipment enabled the women to make their own clothing (one popular class was to make dresses from empty cloth feed bags) and no uniforms were required. WPA programs also supplied clothing, and canneries were used as teaching aids and product generation. Layettes and hospital sundries were made for public institutions and other WPA nursing projects. Maintenance of the barracks, housekeeping and kitchen duties (KP) along with instruction in economics and cooking were integral to the residential program which lasted 3-4 months and was not subject to re-enrollment. The Native American women were paid an <b>additional</b> <b>allotment</b> to find rental housing and travelled with the men who went off the reservation to work. No camps were established exclusively for Native American men, so many travelled as a family group. Blacks were still segregated at this time but in their camps were given the same educational opportunities.|$|E

50|$|Allotment of {{lands to}} {{individuals}} made under the treaties with the Miami permitted {{some members of}} the tribe to remain on the land as private landholders {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of St. Mary's. Individuals also received <b>additional</b> land <b>allotments</b> in subsequent treaties. Allotments given to tribal leaders and others were intended to reinforce the European concept of land use, but they could also be interpreted as bribes. In five treaties negotiated with the Miami between 1818 and 1840, Jean Baptist Richardville received 44 quarter sections of Indiana land in separate allotments and Francis Godfroy received 17 sections.|$|R

50|$|During {{the spring}} of 2013, a new {{legislative}} funding model changed the FTE allotment received by FLVS for students who attend a brick-and-mortar public school. The new funding formula provides FLVS {{a portion of the}} FTE for each public school student and is dependent upon the number of online courses taken. Previously, districts received the full allotment for each student regardless of the number of online courses taken and FLVS received an <b>additional</b> per-course <b>allotment</b> that equaled one-sixth of the FEFP FTE funding. Under the 2013 funding model, FLVS receives one-seventh of the allotment and the district receives six-sevenths if a student takes six courses with their local school and one course online. This is further reduced and divided {{by the total number of}} online courses taken. Funding for homeschool and private school students, however, remain the same. FLVS receives less funding for students who take courses through a district franchises. In 2012-2013, the FLVS funding per FTE was $5,195.18.|$|R
5|$|There {{are nine}} main regions of digital TV allotments (encompassing larger {{portions}} of Croatia) and <b>additional,</b> geographically small <b>allotment</b> areas designed for local broadcasters (typically covering a single city). The main DVB-T television allotment regions are assigned markings D1–D9. The D1 region encompasses Osijek-Baranja and Vukovar-Syrmia counties, {{as well as}} parts of Brod-Posavina County east of Oprisavci. The D2 region covers the rest of Brod-Posavina County, Požega-Slavonia and Virovitica-Podravina counties and nearly all of Bjelovar-Bilogora County, except for an area {{north of the city}} of Bjelovar and part of Sisak-Moslavina County around the town of Novska. The D3 region includes a part of Bjelovar-Bilogora County not encompassed by the D2 region, as well as the territories of Koprivnica-Križevci, Varaždin and Međimurje counties. The D4 region includes Sisak-Moslavina County (except the area around Novska), Krapina-Zagorje and Zagreb counties, the city of Zagreb and the northern part of Karlovac County (including Karlovac and Duga Resa).|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A., Education (Language and Literacy)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. The {{reading of}} real books is the {{ultimate}} aim of reading instruction and the hinge that {{opens the door to}} a lifelong love of reading. However there appears to be little available time for self-selected reading of real books in today's test driven, standard's based curriculum. The time needed to achieve this goal of motivated, independent readers has taken a back seat to reading time filled with instruction on phonics, skills and comprehension strategies. Children have been expected to "read when they finish their work" or "read at home. " Educators face a three dimensional dilemma: teaching children how to read, providing time, space, and selection of relevant literature in the classroom, and finally, instilling in children the desire to choose to read such that they become lifelong readers. This study aimed to address the effects of reorganizing the classroom so that children spend more time actually reading than they do learning about reading. The study proposed that teachers can increase student motivation to read by allowing self-selection of appropriately leveled books, providing time within the school day for independent reading, and engaging students in interactive book discussions and book activities with peers. Determining a valid approach to motivating students to do more wide reading may help educators counteract the decline in reading as students enter the intermediate grades and on into adulthood. The teacher researcher established her classroom as the treatment group in order to follow students' reading preferences, volume, interest, and instructional reading level over a 10 week period. Students in the fifth grade intervention classroom received 20 minutes of independent reading time, self-selection of reading materials, and an <b>additional</b> time <b>allotment</b> of 10 minutes for literature based social activities and book talks. Data gathered from the intervention classroom included the following: (a) student surveys that addressed preferences, attitudes, and behaviors involving reading; (b) on-going reading logs and Student Record Reports from the Accelerated Reader program that monitored reading volume; (c) Pre and post STAR Reading tests to determine instructional reading level and a reading range ZPD (Zone of Proximal Development); and, (d) researcher observations and notes taken during book talks, as well as book wall contributions made by students in treatment group. 	Several conclusions were reached {{at the end of this}} study. Students in the intervention classroom demonstrated several positive effects of the treatment: 	 1. Their motivation to read was enhanced through book talks and book wall contributions as meaning and personal connections were made resulting in deeper understanding of the text. 	 2. Their Instructional Reading Level (IRL) improved as observed in a positive correlation between pre and post scores on the STAR Reading Assessment. 	 3. Their self efficacy beliefs increased as seen in students choosing books at a higher level, completing more books, and learning to share their personal reflections of the literature. 	 4. Students demonstrated an increased eagerness to read as a result of experiencing reading as an interactive social activity shared with peers. It can be concluded that a strong relationship exists between providing independent reading time and interactive book activities and the students' desire to read and continue reading.
