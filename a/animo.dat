5|$|The club crest, {{which was}} used for many years until 2010 when the club exited administration, {{was based on the}} {{achievement}} of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport. It was altered in 2006 to resemble the town's arms more closely, including the Latin motto <b>Animo</b> et Fide, which loosely translated, means With Courage and Faith. The blue shield is taken from the coat of arms of the 'de Stokeport' family, from whom Stockport derives its name. The twin-towered castle above the shield is Stockport Castle, which stood until 1775.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} by the 2015 Group {{takeover of the}} club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the Stockport coat of arms, though the <b>Animo</b> et Fide motto was removed, along with a patch of green {{at the base of}} the badge; the flag of Cheshire, featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and Lancashire, owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010–11 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.|$|E

5|$|The crest was {{altered in}} 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons – {{one at the}} top, with <b>Animo</b> et Fide, and one at the bottom with Stockport County F.C.. In addition, the {{football}} was again removed from the shield. The Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. County's kit was supplied by local manufacturer Umbro who supplied all three of County's kit for the 2013–14 season, replacing Nike, thus making County the only senior club in the UK to wear the Umbro strip in the 2013–14 season. For {{the start of the}} 2014–15 season, County again changed their kit manufacturer, this time from Umbro to Spanish-based manufacturer Joma which supplied County with a new Home, Away and Third kit along with training wear.|$|E

The squad was established in 1926 with four original LaS/LSC Yell Commanders. All the members of the cheering squad were male until the inclusion of female cheerleaders in 1975.|$|E

500|$|There are 1,192 {{scenes in}} the film, and 1,180 contain work done by the special effects department, which animates {{everything}} in an animated scene {{which is not a}} character: blowing wind, dust, rainwater, shadows, etc. A blend of traditional animation and computer-generated imagery was used in the depictions of the ten plagues of Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea.

500|$|He {{opted to}} give the film's animators {{portions}} to animate entirely, rather than the standard process of animating one character, in {{a throwback to the}} way Disney's first features were created. The exception were those responsible for creating the Giant himself, who was created using computer-generated imagery due to the difficulty of creating a metal object [...] "in a fluid-like manner." [...] They had additional trouble with using the computer model to express emotion. The Giant was designed by filmmaker Joe Johnston (best known for designing the Star Wars trilogy), which was refined by production designer Mark Whiting and Steve Markowski, head animator for the Giant. Using software, the team would animate the Giant [...] "on twos" [...] (every other frame, or twelve frames per second) when interacting with other characters, to make it less obvious it was a computer model. Bird brought in students from CalArts to assist in minor animation work due to the film's busy schedule. He made sure to spread out the work on scenes between experienced and younger animators, noting, [...] "You overburden your strongest people and underburden the others [...]" [...] Hiroki Itokazu designed all of the film's CGI props and vehicles, which were created in a variety of software, including Alias Systems Corporation's Maya, Alias' PowerAnimator, a modified version of Pixar's RenderMan, Cambridge Animation's <b>Animo</b> (now part of Toon Boom Animation), Avid Elastic Reality, and Adobe Photoshop.|$|E
2500|$|In 1929, after {{newly elected}} Scullin Labor {{government}} decided {{to suspend the}} compulsory training scheme {{and replace it with}} a voluntary system. At the same time the Citizens Force was renamed the [...] "Militia" [...] in order to illustrate the new nature of military service under this scheme. This decision, as well as the impact of the Great Depression had a disastrous effect on the manning levels of the Militia as few men were able to commit to time off work for training and as a result the decision was made to amalgamate a number of units. The 55th Battalion managed to avoid this fate until 1937, however, when they were amalgamated with the 53rd Battalion, forming the 55th/53rd Battalion (New South Wales Rifle/West Sydney Regiment). This reformed a partnership that had begun at the end of the previous war and which would continue into the next. The battalion's motto was changed to <b>Animo</b> et Fide in 1937.|$|E

2500|$|Hildeprand’s reign {{lasted only}} a few months, then was overthrown by a {{rebellion}} led by Duke Ratchis. The details of the episode are not clear, since the crucial testimony of Paul the Deacon ended with a eulogy {{on the death of}} Liutprand. Hildeprand had been anointed king in 737, during a serious illness suffered by Liutprand (who did not like the choice of king at all: [...] "Non aequo <b>animo</b> accepit" [...] wrote Paul the Deacon [...] ), although, once recovered, he accepted the choice. The new king, then, at least initially enjoyed the support of most of the aristocracy, if not that of the great monarch. Ratchis, the Duke of Friuli who took the throne in his place, came from a family with a long tradition of rebellion against the monarchy and rivalry with the royal family, but on the other hand, he owed his life and the ducal title to Liutprand, who had forgiven him after discovering a conspiracy headed by his father, Pemmo of Friuli.|$|E
