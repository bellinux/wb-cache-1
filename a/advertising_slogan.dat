500|$|The {{original}} {{concept was}} {{a candy bar}} that would have three main components, a heavy texture, rich flavor, and a reasonable price; {{the combination of these}} qualities would ensure that it would be an easily marketable product. [...] It was later decided it should be appealing to as many demographic groups as possible, including children. [...] A candy bar was developed with a dark cocoa-flavored cookie pieces mixed with Japanese-style crisped rice, and finally coated with dark milk chocolate. [...] The cookie bar is pressed relatively flat on five sides; however, the top of the bar presents an uneven surface, even with the chocolate coating. [...] When it came to a name for the product, it was decided that the keyword should be the color [...] "black", which would allude to the dark chocolate flavor. [...] This is in keeping with other marketing trends in Japan, where the color [...] "black" [...] is associated with dark or bittersweet chocolate, such as the popular Meiji Black chocolate bar. [...] To give the product some [...] "impact" [...] with consumers, it was decided to name it after the Japanese god of thunder, Raijin. [...] Although the name of the product uses the English words [...] "Black Thunder" [...] (pronounced or transliterated as Burakku Sandah), the outer package also carries the Japanese kanji term for the product in a smaller font (...) , so that the meaning would not be lost on consumers. [...] An <b>advertising</b> <b>slogan</b> recorded from the development period translates to, [...] "Delicious taste like a flash of lightning!" [...] ( [...] ), but was initially rejected in favor of the basic one-line descriptive [...] "Black cocoa crunch".|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempts}} to analyse {{developments in the}} use of rhetorical figures and persuasive strategies in <b>advertising</b> <b>slogans</b> selected from the late 1800 s till the beginning of the 21 st century. Research has discovered that the use of rhetorical figures, specifically schemes and tropes, in advertising headlines and texts has become more complicated and sophisticated over time. Various persuasive strategies have also been found across different periods. Previous studies have only examined rhetorical figures in isolation rather than a combination {{of a wide range of}} figures. Besides, there have not been any studies done on the historical trends of the use of a combination of rhetorical figures. The combination of rhetorical figures in slogans has also not been researched. More significantly, the combination of rhetorical figures and persuasive strategies in <b>advertising</b> <b>slogans</b> has not been examined. A total of 500 <b>advertising</b> <b>slogans</b> were selected from thirteen multinational and established companies and arranged according to the year or decade they were created. The companies selected were ones that existed from the late 1800 s or early 1900 s and which still exist today. The slogans were then analysed for the presence of schemes and tropes and various persuasive strategies. Two types of analysis were done, that is, a qualitative and a quantitative analysis. The results of the study have revealed changes in the pattern of the rhetorical figures and persuasive strategies employed in <b>advertising</b> <b>slogans</b> through the decades. From the results, a taxonomy has been constructed which can be used to analyse <b>advertising</b> <b>slogans.</b> This taxonomy is a combination of both classical and contemporary approaches, incorporating classical rhetorical figures as well as more contemporary persuasive strategies. The pattern of changes that the results have revealed has also been described. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
