40|$|The {{real option}} {{approach}} {{is used to}} value the minimum revenue guarantee (MRG) and the option to <b>abandon</b> in Build-Operate-Transfer infrastructure projects. The option to <b>abandon</b> is formulated under an investment option held by the concessionaire at contract signing and to expire before construction commencement. MRG is formulated {{as a series of}} European style put options in a single option pricing model. When combined with the option to <b>abandon</b> in the pre-construction phase, MRG is reconstructed as a series of European style call options to develop a compound option pricing formula. The Taiwan High-Speed Rail Project is chosen as a numerical case to apply the formulas. The results show both MRG and the option to <b>abandon</b> can create values. When MRG and the option to <b>abandon</b> are combined, they will counteract each other and their values will thus be reduced. Increasing the MRG level will decrease the value of the option to <b>abandon,</b> and, at a certain MRG level, the option to <b>abandon</b> will be rendered worthless.
