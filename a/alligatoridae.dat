5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{was first}} classified by French zoologist François Marie Daudin as Crocodilus mississipiensis in 1801. In 1807 Georges Cuvier created the genus Alligator; the American alligator shares this genus with the Chinese alligator. They are grouped {{in the family}} <b>Alligatoridae</b> with the caimans.

5|$|The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) is {{an order}} of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles, known as crocodilians. They first {{appeared}} 83.5 million {{years ago in the}} Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family <b>Alligatoridae),</b> and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, crocodilians is a less ambiguous vernacular term for members of this group.|$|E
25|$|Crocodilians {{are more}} closely related to birds and dinosaurs than to most animals {{classified}} as reptiles, the three families being included in the group Archosauria ('ruling reptiles'). Despite their prehistoric look, crocodiles are among the more biologically complex reptiles. Unlike other reptiles, a crocodile has a cerebral cortex and a four-chambered heart. Crocodilians also have the functional equivalent of a diaphragm by incorporating muscles used for aquatic locomotion into respiration. Salt glands are present in the tongues of crocodiles and they have a pore opening {{on the surface of the}} tongue, a trait that separates them from alligators. Salt glands are dysfunctional in <b>Alligatoridae.</b> Their function appears to be similar to that of salt glands in marine turtles. Crocodiles do not have sweat glands and release heat through their mouths. They often sleep with their mouths open and may pant like a dog. Four species of freshwater crocodile climb trees to bask in areas lacking a shoreline.|$|E

50|$|Acynodon is an extinct genus of alligatoroid crocodilian. When first {{described}} it was placed {{within the family}} <b>Alligatoridae,</b> but has since been reclassified as a globidontan. It is {{the oldest and most}} primitive globidontan known to date, with fossils being found from France, Spain, Italy, and Slovenia. Acynodon first appeared during the early Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous and became extinct during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. The skull of Acynodon is extremely brevirostrine; it had a very short and broad snout compared to other known alligatorids. Its dentition was quite derived, with enlarged molariform teeth and a lack of maxillary and dentary caniniform teeth, presumably an adaptation to feed on slow prey with hard shells. The paravertebral osteoderms of Acynodon were distinctively double-keeled.|$|E
50|$|Dwarf {{crocodiles}} {{attain a}} medium adult length of 1.5 m, though the maximum recorded length for this species is 1.9 m. Adult specimens typically weigh between 18 and 32 kg, {{with the largest}} females weighing up to 40 kg and the largest males weighing 80 kg. This makes it the smallest living crocodile species, although the Cuvier's dwarf caiman (Paleosuchus palpebrosus), {{a member of the}} family <b>Alligatoridae,</b> is smaller at up to about 1.7 m. If the Congo dwarf crocodile (O. osborni) is recognized as a valid species, it would be both the smallest crocodile and the smallest crocodilian since it does not surpass 1.2 m. Adults are all dark above and on their sides, while the underside is yellowish with black patches. Individuals living in caves may have orange patches, apparently due to acidic bat guano that erodes the skin of the crocodile. Juveniles have a lighter brown banding on body and tails and yellow patterns on the head.|$|E

50|$|The {{black caiman}} (Melanosuchus niger) {{is a large}} crocodilian and, along with the American alligator, {{is one of the}} biggest extant members of the family <b>Alligatoridae</b> and order Crocodilia. It is a {{carnivorous}} reptile that lives along slow-moving rivers, lakes, seasonally flooded savannas of the Amazon basin, and in other freshwater habitats of South America. It is a quite large species, growing to sizes of at least 5 m and possibly up to 6 m in length, which make it the biggest reptile in the Neotropical ecozone. As their name implies, the black caiman has a dark coloration, as an adult. In some individuals the dark coloration can appear almost black. However, they have grey to brown banding on the lower jaw. Juveniles have a more vibrant coloration compared to adults with prominent white to pale yellow banding on the flanks that remains present well into adulthood, at least more when compared to other species. The morphology is quite different from other caimans but the bony ridge that occurs in other caimans is present. The head is large and heavy; an advantage in catching larger prey.|$|E
50|$|The {{black caiman}} {{is one of}} the largest extant reptiles. It is the largest {{predator}} in the Amazon basin and possibly the largest member of the family <b>Alligatoridae.</b> Most adult black caimans are 2.8 to(-) 4.26 m in length, with a few old males growing larger than 5 m and exceeding a weight of 400 kg. Sub-adult male specimens of around 2.5 - 3.35 m will weigh roughly 95 - 100 kg, around the same size as a mature female, but will quickly increase in bulk and weight. Mid-sized mature males of 3.5 - 4 m weigh approximately 300 kg. Another sampling of subadult males found them to range in length from 2.1 to 2.8 m, averaging 2.45 m, and that they weighed from 26 to 86 kg, averaging 48 kg. The black caiman broadly overlaps in size with the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), although it is on average larger at maturity. In some areas (such as the Araguaia River) this species is consistently reported at 4 to(-) 5 m in length, much larger than the alligator (which rarely even reaches 4 meters), although specimens this size are uncommon. Several widely reported but unconfirmed (and probably largely anecdotal) sources report that the black caiman can grow to over 6 m in length and weigh up to 1100 kg. In South America, two other crocodilians reportedly reach similar sizes: the American Crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) and the Orinoco Crocodile (C. intermedius).|$|E
50|$|The American {{alligator}} is {{a relatively}} large species of crocodilian. On average {{it is the second}} largest species in the <b>Alligatoridae</b> family, behind only the black caiman. As with all crocodilians, and as opposed to many mammals where size eventually diminishes with old age, healthy alligators may continue to expand throughout their lives and the oldest specimens are the largest. Very old, large male alligators reach an expected maximum size of up to 4.6 m in length, weighing up to 453 kg, while females reach a maximum of 3 m. On rare occasions, a large, old male may grow to an even greater length. During the 19th and 20th centuries, larger males reaching 5 to 6 m have been reported. The largest reported individual size was a male killed in 1890 on Marsh Island, Louisiana, and reportedly measured at 5.8 m in length, but no voucher specimen was available, since the alligator was left on a muddy bank after having been measured due to having been too massive to relocate. If the size of this animal were correct, it would have weighed approximately 1000 kg. Large adult alligators tend to be relatively robust and bulky compared to other similarly length crocodilians, for example captive males measuring 3 to 4 m were found to weigh 200 to 350 kg (although captive specimens may outweigh wild specimens due to lack of hunting behavior and other stressors). The largest alligator ever killed in Florida was 5.31 m, as reported by the Everglades National Park. The largest alligator scientifically verified in Florida for the period from 1977 to 1993 was reportedly 4.23 m and weighed 473 kg, although another specimen (size estimated from skull) may have measured 4.54 m.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{morphological}} analyses, extant {{members of}} the orderCrocodylia are divided into three families, <b>Alligatoridae,</b> Crocodylidae, and Gavialidae. Gavialidae includes one species, the gharial, Gavialis gangeticus. In this study we have examined crocodilian relationships in phylogenetic analyses of seven mito-chondrial genomes that have been sequenced in their entirety. The analyses {{did not support the}} morpho-logically acknowledged separate position of the gharial in the crocodilian tree. Instead the gharial joined the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) on a common branch that was shown to constitute a sister group to traditional Crocodylidae (less Tomistoma). Thus, the analyses suggest the recognition of only two Croco-dylia families, <b>Alligatoridae</b> and Crocodylidae, with the latter encompassing traditional Crocodylidae plus Gavialis/Tomistoma. A molecular dating of the diver-gence between <b>Alligatoridae</b> and Crocodylidae sug-gests that this basal split among recent crocodilians took place 140 million years before present, at the Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary. The results suggest that at least five crocodilian lineages survived the mass extinction at the KT boundary...|$|E
