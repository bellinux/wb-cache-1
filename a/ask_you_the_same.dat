My eyes are very patriotic—red, white, 2 ̆ 6 blue. The circles are almost down to my knees. Sure am in great shape. I did like Mexican Hayride pretty much because there was a lot [of dancing?] in it. Every time I see anyone dance it just about breaks my heart. I’d {{always wanted to be a}} dancer. Maybe someday when I’m really hard up. What {{happened}} on your instrument check up? Did you stay awake long enough to pass? Did you get any sleep on the train coming up? Did Tom get the tickets? (Tune in Saturday for the next thrilling chapter. I feel like a radio program the way I’m firing questions at you). It’s hard to write a letter without one from you to answer (hint, hint).

The pictures {{in front of you}} show how your breathing might feel, from no difficulty at all, to the most difficulty you can imagine. You might feel this difficulty breathing in your chest or in your throat. Another scale simply asks you to tell us {{how hard it is to}} breathe – from nothing at all, to the hardest breathing imaginable. With the final set of pictures, tell us how your legs feel – from nothing at all, to the hardest imaginable.

40|$|Edith Mitchell, MD, FACS, knows a {{lot about}} {{emergency}} medical care. But she had no experience as a patient in an emergency department – until she was critically injured in December 2010. From 1987 until 2004, Dr. Mitchell, a medical oncologist who has practiced at Jefferson since 1997, held increasingly responsible roles supervising emergency care as part of the National Guard. By the end of her military career, Dr. Mitchell was overseeing 55 of 84 National Guard medical units. She was responsible for establishing standard operating procedures for emergency care and emergency transportation – and ensuring that all military physicians, nurses and related personnel were properly trained on those procedures. Not surprisingly, when she found herself critically injured in an automobile accident, Dr. Mitchell says she quickly began assessing her injuries and her pain. “My training and experience helped me,” she says. “I immediately turned off my car to make sure there was no gasoline flowing, and I put the car in park in case it shifted. I also began assessing myself and my own injuries so I could tell people what was hurt. ” And, Dr. Mitchell admits, she was gearing up to insist that she be transferred to Jefferson as soon as her condition was stable. As it turned out, she was able to receive top-notch care in the suburbs – thanks to Paoli Hospital’s Level II Trauma Center, which had earned accreditation just two months prior to Dr. Mitchell’s accident. As the Paoli nurses were helping Dr. Mitchell put on a gown, she says, “I heard somebody outside my room say, ‘I would know that voice anywhere – that’s Edith Mitchell!’” A physician entered the room wearing a surgical mask, which Dr. Mitchell swears looked not like a mask but a halo. She recognized this “angel” as Murray J. Cohen, MD, FACS. Dr. Cohen is not only Director of Jefferson’s Division of Acute Care Surgery, but he is also Dr. Mitchell’s longtime colleague and friend. Dr. Mitchell laughs as she recalls her initial exchange with Dr. Cohen: “I said, ‘Murray, {{what are you doing in}} an emergency room at Paoli Hospital?!’ and he said, ‘I was going to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing, but I can see you’re hurt!’” That’s when Dr. Mitchell learned of – and began to benefit from – Paoli’s recent trauma accreditation. This joint effort between the Division of Acute Care Surgery at Jefferson and Paoli Hospital is the only accredited trauma center in Chester County (see sidebar). “The trauma service at Paoli was able to take care of everything,” Dr. Mitchell concludes. “They performed an immediate assessment of my injuries and then delivered specifically targeted care – almost instantaneously. ...|$|E

40|$|Extract] Some {{years ago}} as an 11 th or 12 th grade student puzzling over a {{particularly}} difficult physics or chemistry problem, I used to wonder whether the study of science was so important. I guess many of <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> yourselves <b>the</b> <b>same</b> question regularly. <b>The</b> decision I made is obvious, but I believe that the question is even more critical to <b>you</b> in <b>the</b> early 1990 's. In {{the world we live}} in, study of the central sciences such as chemistry, physics and mathematics is of crucial importance. And I affirm that statement, regardless of whether those studies finish at the end of matriculation, or they continue for additional years at University in specific areas of science or in applied areas such as engineering or medicine. By way of illustration, I want to take a (rather light-hearted) look at aspects of a topic often dealt with in the media, and about which you probably feel you have some knowledge. Let me give you a rather different perspective [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a {{major public}} health problem in Iowa. If <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> most people if they knew someone who has {{sustained}} a concussion or hit their head in a fall or automobile accident, they would reply “yes”, however if <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> person if they knew someone with a TBI, they might respond “no. ” Many people do not realize what a TBI is. This report intends to present {{a picture of the}} silent epidemic of TBI by using vital records and hospital discharge data to raise awareness among policymakers, researchers and the general public about the magnitude and cost of TBI in Iowa. The purpose of this report is to describe the epidemiology of TBI in Iowa to help guide policy and programming. TBI is a result of an external force which transfers energy to the brain. Stroke is caused by a disruption of blood flow in the brain that leads to brain injury. Though stroke is recognized as the 3 rd leading cause of death nationally 2, and is an injury that affects the brain it does not meet the definition a traumatic brain injury and is not included in this report...|$|R
40|$|If <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> a {{group of}} people "What are the qualities of a good teacher?" {{they are more likely to}} say that a teacher must be knowledgeable, compassionate, firm and fair. If <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> group of people "How do we prepare {{teachers}} to have all those good qualities?" you are more likely to get as many suggestions as there are people in the group. We all seem to agree on the quality teacher we want but we are less in agreement about the ways in which we might achieve those objectives. Over the years several models of teacher education have been suggested. These models testify to the continuous search for the best way to prepare teachers. There are varying viewpoints on whether teachers are better prepared if they spend more time in school so that their knowledge is acquired through practical means or whether teachers should receive sufficient knowledge on campus studies before they are let loose. What is sufficient theoretical and practical knowledge for the beginning teacher anyway? Do we know enough about how the participant on the teaching program makes sense of the knowledge acquired from the program when against his/her life experiences? This study explores the process of learning to teach by eight young women on the B. Ed degree link program as they prepare themselves to become English language teachers for secondary schools in Malaysia. The study follows their progress as they make the transition to beginning teachers. Specifically, the study explores the construct of their beliefs about teaching and learning prior to teaching practice, during teaching practice and in the post-training situation. Discussion of the findings from this longitudinal study is followed by recommendations for improving the preservice program and the support for beginning teachers in the novice year of teaching...|$|R
