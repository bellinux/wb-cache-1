5|$|The Act was unusual, {{as it was}} {{obtained}} without Pyott's consent, and created {{a new group of}} commissioners from local justices and dignitaries. They were empowered to set the rates for tolls, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> was obliged to transport all goods at the established rates. If there were not sufficient boats <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> did not provide more, they could license others to provide carriage services. They could also order that locks, wharves and warehouses should be erected. The size of boats was specified, and were to be capable of carrying between 20 and 30 tons of cargo. The tolls set were quite moderate, and a group of merchants appear to have leased the river from Pyott for a period after 1767, but he eventually took control again.|$|E

5|$|The surname Golding {{is synonymous}} {{with a variety of}} hop known as Goldings and, {{although}} it is not certain who discovered the hop, it has been accredited to John Golding (who died some time before 1811), the great nephew of Thomas <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> of Ditton Court, or to his son John (who died at Ditton Place in 1851).|$|E

White planned to create a 24-team league called the Professional Basketball League of America, in which he owned all the teams and arenas. However, the league folded after just a month, and the players of White's teams were equally distributed among the 11 remaining NBL franchises. As a consequence, every team had a 9.09% chance of landing Mikan, who ended up on the Minneapolis Lakers, playing for coach John Kundla.|$|E

5|$|On 10 February, Bergen Aviation {{announced}} that they had applied the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration to operate a scheduled service between Flesland and Oslo Airport, Fornebu. At the time, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) had a monopoly on the route, which was Norway's busiest, carrying 2,000 to 3,000 passengers per day. Einar Falck, Vesta's chief executive officer, stated that the mechanics' strike which had recently hit SAS had shown how vulnerable the SAS monopoly was. He further stated that should Bergen Aviation receive concession, they would acquire Boeing 737 or Douglas DC-9 aircraft for the route, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> group would consider listing the company. The application {{was part of a}} trend among smaller Norwegian airlines to apply for the new route. At the time there were 42 pending applications from 15 airlines awaiting decision in the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The Progress Party's Youth supported Bergen Aviation's application at its national convention.|$|E
5|$|Other early designs {{included}} Drum House, which boasted Scotland's first venetian window, and Mavisbank, both near Edinburgh. Mavisbank House, constructed between 1723 and 1727, was {{the first}} Palladian villa in Scotland, a collaboration between Adam <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner,</b> amateur architect Sir John Clerk of Penicuik. The latter claimed much of the credit, and certainly criticised some of Adam's suggestions, although evidence suggests Adam got his way {{on a number of}} points. As at Hopetoun, here Adam enjoyed an unusually close relationship with his client, despite their differences of opinion. His most ambitious early work was the baroque, Vanbrugh-inspired house at Arniston, near Gorebridge. Built for Robert Dundas, a lawyer and politician linked to the Earl of Stair, Arniston includes extensive grounds laid out by Adam, with a parterre and cascade, and a main avenue centred on Arthur's Seat to the north. The stucco work to the hall at Arniston is one of Adam's finest Vanbrughian interiors.|$|E
