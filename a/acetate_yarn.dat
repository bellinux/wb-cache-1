40|$|Cellulose acetate {{used in the}} {{manufacture}} of <b>acetate</b> <b>yarns</b> is commonly obtained from cotton-linters or wood-pulp cellulose. Varying in the origin and in {{the manufacture}}r, cellulose acetate often differs in its processability. The paper belongs to the investigation the properties of <b>acetate</b> <b>yarns</b> manufactured of the cellulose acetate varied in its origin and manufactured by different suppliers. Mechanical properties (including stress relaxation and frictional behaviour) of <b>acetate</b> multifilament <b>yarns</b> as well as physical-chemical properties of acetate fibre substance are investigated. Regular discrete relaxation time spectrum of <b>acetate</b> <b>yarns</b> is determined using the generalized Maxwell model. Experiments showed that the origin of cellulose acetate does not have great influence on mechanical properties of the <b>acetate</b> <b>yarns,</b> however, the yarn manufactured from wood-pulp-originated cellulose acetate have little advantage against others in strength and extensibility, and also are more uniform in the properties. Physical-chemical analysis revealed that the fibre of wood-pulp-originated cellulose acetate has a higher degree of polymerization and a little higher amount of low-molecular mass fractions. Surface friction of the yarns lubricated with different lubricants is also investigated...|$|R

50|$|On 12 December 1912 Henri and Camille Dreyfus, {{funded by}} the {{entrepreneur}} Alexander Clavel-Respinger, set up a factory in Basel, Cellonit Gesellschaft Dreyfus & Co., to produce fireproof celluloid from cellulose acetate. The Cellonit company, founded in 1913, was innovative in developing new materials.The Dreyfus brothers produced the first <b>acetate</b> continuous filament <b>yarn</b> in 1913.However, most of the production went in film for motion pictures or toiletry items.The Paris-based Pathé cinema equipment manufacturer became a major customer.The company also made lacquers that were used for German Zeppelins and airplanes.Demand for acetate lacquers grew steadily as the aircraft industry expanded.|$|R
40|$|Viscoelastic {{properties}} of acetate and polyester multifilament yarns {{in the compound}} loading cycle are theoretically and experimentally studied and the features of inverse stress relaxation (IR) after the blockage of viscoelastic recovery of the yarns are revealed in the study. Modelling method of the processes at the referred loading cycle is proposed {{on the basis of}} generalized Maxwell model. Analysing the behaviour of the model possessing different relaxation time spectra {{it was found that the}} longer is free recovery of the model until its blockage the less is the resulting recovery power of the model. The duration of recovery is more sensitive to the changes in the amount of the resulting IR in the model possessing more short relaxation times. To prove the theoretical findings the experimental investigation was provided with acetate (16. 6 tex) and polyester (15. 6 tex) multifilament yarns analysing their behavior in the same loading cycle. The experiments confirmed basic theoretical findings. Some differences in the reaction of <b>acetate</b> and polyester <b>yarn</b> to the blockage of their viscoelastic recovery are shown...|$|R

50|$|The {{closely related}} {{synthetic}} textile industry {{appeared in the}} years just after the First War. The production of artificial silk, more properly known as viscose rayon, made from bleached wood pulp, began in Cornwall, Ontario in 1925, in a factory built by Courtaulds (Canada). A year later Celanese Canada began making <b>acetate</b> <b>yarn</b> in a new plant in Drummondville, Quebec. DuPont Canada {{was the first to}} manufacture nylon yarn in Canada at its factory in Kingston, Ontario in 1942. This secret material was initially used for parachutes but following the war was used to make nylon stockings.|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of reducing the}} use of auxiliaries in conventional cellulose acetate dyeing with disperse dyes using ultrasound technique was studied {{as an alternative to}} the standard procedure. Dyeing of cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>yarn</b> was carried out by using either mechanical agitation alone, with and without auxiliaries, or joining the mechanical and ultrasound agitation in the bath where the temperature range was between 60 °C and 80 °C. The best results of dyeing kinetics were obtained with ultrasound coupled with mechanical agitation without auxiliaries. Hence the corresponding half dyeing time, absorption rate constants according to Cegarra-Puente modified equation and ultrasound efficiency were calculated confirming the synergic effect of sonication on dyeing kinetics. Finally, the fastness test gives good values for samples dyed with ultrasound technique even without use of auxiliaries. Those results suggest the possibility to work up a well equalized dyeing of cellulose acetate without using additional chemicals into the dye bat...|$|E

Dyeing of cellulose <b>acetate</b> <b>yarn</b> was carried out by using either mechanical agitation alone, with and without auxiliaries, or coupling mechanical and ultrasound agitation in the bath where the temperature range was maintained between 60 and 80 °C. The best results of dyeing kinetics were obtained with ultrasound coupled with mechanical agitation without auxiliaries (90 % of bath exhaustion value at 80 °C). Hence the corresponding half dyeing times, absorption rate constants according to Cegarra-Puente modified equation and ultrasound efficiency were calculated confirming the synergic effect of sonication on the dyeing kinetics. Moreover the apparent activation energies were also evaluated and the positive effect of ultrasound added to mechanical agitation was evidenced by the lower value (48 kJ/mol) in comparison with 112 and 169 kJ/mol for mechanical stirring alone with auxiliaries and without, respectively. Finally, the fastness tests gave good values for samples dyed with ultrasound technique even without auxiliaries. Moreover color measurements in dyed yarns showed that the color yield obtained by ultrasound-assisted dyeing at 80 °C of cellulose acetate without using additional chemicals into the dye bath reached the same value yielded by mechanical agitation, but with remarkably shorter tim...|$|E
