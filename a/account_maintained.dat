50|$|A slush fund, {{also known}} as a black fund, is any fund or <b>account</b> <b>maintained</b> for corrupt or illegal purposes, {{especially}} in the political sphere. Such funds may be kept hidden and maintained separately from other funds that are used for legitimate purposes. They may be employed by government or corporate officials as part of efforts to discreetly pay influential people in return for preferential treatment, advance information (for example, to acquire non-public information in financial transactions) or some other service. The funds themselves may not be kept secret but the source of the funds or how they were acquired or for what purposes they are used may be hidden. Use of slush funds to influence government activities may be viewed as subversive of the democratic process.|$|E

50|$|A stored-value card is a {{payments}} {{card with}} a monetary value stored on the card itself, not in an external <b>account</b> <b>maintained</b> by a financial institution. Stored-value cards differ from debit cards, where money is on deposit with the issuer, and credit cards which are subject to credit limits set by the issuer. Another difference between stored-value cards and debit and credit cards is that debit and credit cards are usually issued {{in the name of}} individual account holders, while stored-value cards may be anonymous, {{as in the case of}} gift cards. Stored-value cards are prepaid money cards and may be disposed when the value is used, or the card value may be topped up, as in the case of telephone calling cards or when used as a fare card.|$|E

He asks Izna to escape and offers her a new passport, tickets, and access to an <b>account</b> <b>maintained</b> at a Swiss bank from which she can withdraw unlimited money. When Kabir kisses her before their separation, Izna shoots him in the stomach, upon which Kabir immediately dies. Running away with the hard disk containing the original data, she goes to Guru Saldanah and hands over the hard disk to him. However, she is soon surprised to know that Guru Saldanah is indeed a fraud, as Kabir had pointed out, and that after the task, {{she was supposed to}} have been killed. Aayan was given this responsibility, but he had changed his mind as he was in love with her. As Saldanah tried to kill Izna himself, Aayan tackled him and killed him instead.|$|E

40|$|Racial {{profiling}} {{appears to}} be morally more troubling when the racial group that {{is the object of}} the profile suffers from background injustice. This article examines two accounts of this intuition. The responsibility-based <b>account</b> <b>maintains</b> that racial profiling is morally more problematic if the higher offender rate within the profiled group is the result of social injustices for which other groups in society are responsible. The expressive harm based <b>account</b> <b>maintains</b> that racial profiling is more problematic if it makes background injustice vivid and thereby causes the profiled to feel resentment. I raise problems with both accounts and suggest a third account. On the humiliation-based account, individuals who are subjected to racial profiling in a context of background injustice are placed in a situation in which they cannot prevent appearing to onlookers in a demeaning way.

5000|$|The UK law on {{securities}} recognises, as {{a matter}} of principle, the property of the final investor on all the [...] "substantive rights" [...] pertaining to a security. Nevertheless, the generalised practice of characterising the deposit as a [...] "trust" [...] at every tier of the holding chain prevents the holder of an <b>account</b> <b>maintained</b> by a British intermediary characterised as [...] "trustee" [...] to assert its securities at a level upper to its account provider. In the latter case the beneficiary of the trust agreement, becomes itself a [...] "beneficial owner" [...] with no possibility to reflect this ownership in its balance sheet. This situation leads in practice to the same effects as the [...] "contractualisation" [...] of the [...] "substantive" [...] rights incurred in the US by Article 8 of the UCC. Accordingly, the United Kingdom and most other countries of Common law felt no difficulty of being brought into line with the American contractual approach.|$|E
5000|$|Open market {{operations}} {{involve the}} {{buying and selling}} of U.S. government securities (federal agency and mortgage-backed). The term 'open market' means that the Fed doesn't decide on its own which securities dealers it will do business with on a particular day. Rather, the choice emerges from an 'open market' in which the various securities dealers that the Fed does business withthe primary dealerscompete {{on the basis of}} price. Open market operations are flexible and thus, the most frequently used tool of monetary policy.Open market operations are the primary tool used to regulate the supply of bank reserves. This tool consists of Federal Reserve purchases and sales of financial instruments, usually securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, Federal agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. Open market operations are carried out by the Domestic Trading Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under direction from the FOMC. The transactions are undertaken with primary dealers.The Fed's goal in trading the securities is to affect the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow reserves from each other. When the Fed wants to increase reserves, it buys securities and pays for them by making a deposit to the <b>account</b> <b>maintained</b> at the Fed by the primary dealer's bank. When the Fed wants to reduce reserves, it sells securities and collects from those accounts. Most days, the Fed does not want to increase or decrease reserves permanently so it usually engages in transactions reversed within a day or two. That means that a reserve injection today could be withdrawn tomorrow morning, only to be renewed at some level several hours later. These short-term transactions are called repurchase agreements (repos)the dealer sells the Fed a security and agrees to buy it back at a later date.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a test for}} a nonparametric null against a nonparametric alter-native that takes into <b>account</b> <b>maintained</b> assumptions on the model. Economic theory may suggest that the functions in the model have certain properties but can be silent {{as to whether they}} have other properties of interest. In this case the researcher is interested in a procedure that takes the maintained assumptions of the model as given and can test whether it possesses additional qualities. We define the null to be the model that imposes the maintained assumptions and a set of additional properties of interest on the functions. The alternative is a model where the maintained assumptions hold but the additional properties are violated. Both the null and the alternative are assumed to be nonparametric. Two sieve sequences are built to approximate the null and the alternative. These sieves are based on the shape restricted estimator developed in Beresteanu (2004) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{triumph of}} the reason {{as the only way}} of natural {{knowledge}} was the most remarkable result of the paradigm shift occurred during the so-called Scientific Revolution, which reaches from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment, and in which dogmatic reasoning lost progressively its role as the principal form of knowledge. Nevertheless, during the following centuries, {{a large part of the}} men of science were willing to favour the conversion of dogma into an agent of rational thought. This paper, tries to offer a point of reflection on the influence that the biblical <b>account</b> <b>maintained</b> in the construction of the modern scientific theories that, somehow, tried to explain relevant issues such as the origin of physical and moral differences between humans. The broader objective is to demonstrate that, as a form of cultural expression, the dogmatic-religious thought continued to play a transcendental role in the legitimation of a part of the modern rational scientific discourse, committed to defending the civilizing role and the physical and moral superiority of Western states, far beyond what the simple use of reason permitted...|$|E
40|$|Over the years, the Nigerian {{economy has}} deeply relied on revenue {{generated}} {{from the sale of}} crude oil for the running of government activities; and this has brought reckless spending and mismanagement of public funds in governance. Before now, several government agencies in Nigeria were self-sufficient to collect money on behalf of the federal government and they had the freedom to expend part of it since they only needed to remit only a portion of the declared amount. Several challenges are posed due to high cost of cash management in Nigeria economy which is increasing every year. One of the challenges arising from high-cash usage among others includes operation of multiple accounts. Governments have been operating multiple accounts for revenue collection and spending in contrary to the provision of the Nigerian Constitution which requires that all government revenue generation must be remitted into a single account. As a result of economic challenges, Central Bank of Nigeria was directed to open a Consolidated Revenue Account where all government revenue, incomes and inflows are collected into one single <b>account</b> <b>maintained</b> by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN, 2014).
