5000|$|In the Discworld {{series by}} Terry Pratchett, magical {{properties}} {{are attributed to}} the number eight rather than seven. Traditionally on the Discworld, <b>an</b> eighth <b>son</b> of <b>an</b> eighth <b>son</b> becomes <b>a</b> wizard. A wizard's eighth son—the eighth <b>son</b> of <b>an</b> eighth <b>son</b> of <b>an</b> eighth <b>son</b> (<b>an</b> unlikely and deliberately discouraged event)—is a Sourcerer, a dangerously powerful wizard. In the novel Equal Rites, instead of <b>an</b> eighth <b>son</b> of <b>an</b> eighth <b>son</b> <b>a</b> daughter is born, but due to a dying wizard passing on his staff before checking the child's gender, the daughter receives the wizarding powers normally given to the eighth son. This causes problems as females {{are supposed to be}} witches, and males wizards, due to each gender having a different method of thinking, and the powers associated with each title are not interchangeable. The novel Sourcery centers on the unlikely story of <b>a</b> wizard's eighth <b>son</b> - the Sourcerer.|$|R
