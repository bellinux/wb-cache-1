Alperson from Grand National Films, a newly established, {{independent}} studio, approached him to make movies for $100,000 a film and 10% of the profits. Cagney made two films for Grand National: Great Guy <b>and</b> <b>Something</b> <b>to</b> Sing About. He received good reviews for both, but overall the production quality was not up to Warner Bros. standards, and the films did not do well. A third film, Dynamite, was planned, but Grand National ran out of money.|$|E

500|$|In {{the years}} after the 1918 Armistice, Pankhurst {{continued}} to promote her nationalist vision of British unity. She maintained a focus on women's empowerment, but her days of fighting with government officialdom were over. She defended the presence and reach of the British Empire: [...] "Some talk about the Empire and Imperialism {{as if it were}} something to decry <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be ashamed of. t is a great thing to be the inheritors of an Empire like ours... great in territory, great in potential wealth.... If we can only realise and use that potential wealth we can destroy thereby poverty, we can remove and destroy ignorance." [...] For years she travelled around England and North America, rallying support for the British Empire and warning audiences about the dangers of Bolshevism.|$|E
500|$|Định took {{advantage}} of his improved socio-economic status to recruit a group of impoverished people, whom he organised for clearing land and founding a đồn điền ("military colony") in Gò Công. This occurred after Emperor Tự Đức's 1854 order, which granted General Nguyễn Tri Phương permission to organise southern levies in this manner. In recognition of his achievements, the mandarin authorities gave Định the rank of deputy regimental commander. His success in developing đồn điền was attributed to his organisational ability {{as well as a}} genuine concern for the welfare of those under his protection, ensuring that they had enough to eat <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> wear. He was regarded as energetic, brave and compassionate. In gratitude for Định's land development skills, the peasants gave him the middle name Công, which means [...] "great public service".|$|E
500|$|The {{quality of}} the game's {{graphics}} was rated poorly by most reviewers, reviewers noted that the overall {{quality of the}} game made up for this deficiency. GameSpy's Carla Harker described the graphics as [...] "...dated by about seven years" [...] and the game as a [...] "technological pariah", despite calling it one of the best role-playing games released in the past year. Green similarly described graphics as dated <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> put up with in favor of gameplay. Website Just RPG's Eric Arevalo described them as simplistic but noted the game's story and the ability to control [...] "fascinating mutant creatures" [...] made up for this. The Entertainment Depot's Nick Stewart differed, praising the graphics as [...] "Simplistic without being plain, lavish without being overdone" [...] as well as the fluidity of character animation and detail of character designs.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed-to-positive reviews. Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. He favorably compared the episode to the sixth season episode [...] "The Rain King" [...] and noted that [...] "'The Rain King' [...] was quite simply one of the joys of season six. So it hardly {{came as a surprise}} to me that I enjoyed Bell's 'The Goldberg Variation" [...] entry for [...] It was cute, light-hearted, and a little kooky, with a happy ending to boot." [...] Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named the episode the [...] "finest stand-alone episode" [...] of Season Seven and wrote, [...] "Since 'The X-Files’ roots are in horror, feel-good episodes are few and far between, <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be treasured when they appear. The Goldberg Variation is the perfect feel-good X-Files episode; not too soppy, not too harsh, but just the right mix of ludicrous gangster deaths and saving the cute kid." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. She called the episode a [...] "charmer" [...] and praised Willie Garson's characterization of Harry Weems. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote positively of the episode, writing, [...] "'The Goldberg Variation' is a clever, witty standout from the recent middling run of X-Files episodes." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and called it a [...] "fun" [...] entry that shows off the series' [...] "emotional palette". He felt that the episode successfully managed to convey a [...] "clever and whimsical" [...] feel, but that the conceit of a [...] "good man" [...] as the monster of the episode does not make it particularly scary. All-in-all, he felt that it [...] "all works out in the end".|$|E

2500|$|Reading [...] Rabbi Levi {{taught that}} blessed actions bless {{those who are}} {{responsible}} for them, and cursed actions curse those {{who are responsible for}} them. The Midrash interpreted the words of [...] "A perfect and just weight you shall have," [...] to mean that if one acts justly, one will have something to take <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> give, something to buy <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> sell. Conversely, the Midrash read [...] to teach, [...] "You shall not have (possessions if there are) in your bag diverse weights, a great and a small. You shall not have (possessions if there are) in your house diverse measures, a great and a small." [...] Thus, if one does employ deceitful measures, one will not have anything to take or give, to buy or sell. The Midrash taught that God tells businesspeople that they [...] "may not make" [...] one measure great and another small, but if they do, they [...] "will not make" [...] a profit. The Midrash likened this commandment to that of [...] (20:20 in the NJPS) [...] "You shall not make with Me gods of silver, or gods of gold, you shall not make," [...] for if a person did make gods of silver and gold, then that person {{would not be able to}} afford to have even gods of wood or stone.|$|E

2500|$|Named for its ever-present ledge, Bedrock Gardens {{was bought}} by its present owners in 1980, {{complete}} with a farm house, built circa 1740, a historic barn and three-holer outhouse. Over the next 20 years, it was extensively improved. The wooded areas were lumbered, a trail system was developed, and it was managed as a tree farm. A wildlife pond was built, and work was started on its multiple perennial and shrub beds. Hardscape {{in the form of}} walls, paths, water features and topographical improvements, have been added. Today it is noted for its concept of [...] "the garden as a journey," [...] with a starting point, [...] "events" [...] (or garden spaces) as places to go, <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do along the way.|$|E
2500|$|One of Reed's sore points {{resulting}} from that unauthorized re-editing {{was that the}} [...] "heavenly wine and roses" [...] melody was cut out of [...] "Sweet Jane". In the original recording, this part was intended to provide a perfectly flowing bridge to a full-fledged plagal cadence two-chord version of the chorus (earlier choruses in the song have a 4-chord riff). In Reed's initial solo performances, he would include the verse (see for instance American Poet), until 1973, when he would routinely leave it out, as the bridge fits less well in a more hard rock version (as heard for instance on Rock 'n' Roll Animal). However, the post-Reed, Doug Yule-led Velvets always performed the song with the verse included. A career-spanning retrospective of Reed's recordings with the Velvet Underground and as a solo artist, NYC Man (The Ultimate Collection 1967–2003), which Reed compiled himself, uses the shorter version. When asked about the shortened versions of [...] "Sweet Jane" [...] and [...] "New Age" [...] and Reed's long-standing claims that they were re-edited without his consent, Yule claimed that Reed had in fact edited the songs himself. [...] "He edited it. You have to understand at the time, the motivation was... Lou was, {{and all of us}} were, intent on one thing and that was to be successful and what you had to do to be successful in music, was you had to have a hit, and a hit had to be uptempo, short, and with no digressions, straight ahead basically, you wanted a hook <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> feed the hook and that was it. 'Sweet Jane' was arranged just exactly the way it is on the original Loaded release exactly for that reason—to be a hit! 'Who Loves The Sun' was done exactly that way for that reason—to be a hit." ...|$|E
