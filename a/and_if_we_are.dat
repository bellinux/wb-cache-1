25|$|An {{exhaustive}} search algorithm can {{solve the problem}} in time 2kn'O(1). Vertex cover is therefore fixed-parameter tractable, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> only interested in small k, we can solve the problem in polynomial time. One algorithmic technique that works here is called bounded search tree algorithm, and its idea is to repeatedly choose some vertex and recursively branch, with two cases at each step: place either the current vertex or all its neighbours into the vertex cover.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{table lists}} a few selected values for t-distributions with ν {{degrees of freedom}} {{for a range of}} one-sided or two-sided critical regions. For an example of how to read this table, take the fourth row, which begins with 4; that means ν, the number of degrees of freedom, is 4 (<b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> dealing, as above, with n values with a fixed sum, n = 5). Take the fifth entry, in the column headed 95% for one-sided (90% for two-sided). The value of that entry is 2.132. Then the probability that T is less than 2.132 is 95% or Pr(−∞ < T < 2.132) = 0.95; this also means that Pr(−2.132 < T < 2.132) = 0.9.|$|E

2500|$|The Report's [...] "program for action" [...] was a {{call for}} {{creation}} of a new [...] "National Climatic Research Program." [...] It stated (p.62), [...] "If we are to react rationally to the inevitable climatic changes of the future, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> ever to predict their future course, whether they are natural or man-induced, a far greater understanding of these changes is required than we now possess. It is, moreover, important that this knowledge be acquired as soon as possible." [...] For that reason, it stated, [...] "the time has now come to initiate a broad and coordinated attack on the problem of climate and climatic change." ...|$|E
2500|$|The later major halachic {{authorities}} {{defer to}} both Karo and Isserles and cite {{their work as}} the baseline from which further halachic rulings evolve. In one of many similar statements by his peers reflecting this unique authority, the 17th century scholar Joshua Höschel ben Joseph writes that [...] "from their wells do we drink and should a question arise (on their work), not for this shall we come to annul their words, rather we must study further {{as much as we}} can, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> unable to resolve (our question) then we will ascribe it to our own lack of knowledge and not (as a reason to) annul the words of these geniuses..." ...|$|E

We won France by playing music which was ours and not a pale imitation of others, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to develop in America we must develop along our own lines." [...] In 1919 Europe made more recordings for Pathé Records. These include both instrumentals and accompaniments with vocalist Noble Sissle who, with Eubie Blake, would later have great success with their 1921 production of Shuffle Along, which gives us the classic song [...] "I'm Just Wild About Harry". Differing in style from Europe's recordings of a few years earlier, they incorporate blues, blue notes, and early jazz influences (including a rather stiff cover record of the Original Dixieland Jass Band's [...] "Clarinet Marmalade").|$|E

2500|$|Richard Dawkins {{stated that}} [...] "the authors seem {{undecided}} whether their theme is quantum theory or consciousness. Both are indeed mysterious, and their genuine mystery needs {{none of the}} hype with which this film relentlessly and noisily belabours us", concluding that the film is [...] "tosh". Professor Clive Greated wrote that [...] "thinking on neurology and addiction are covered in some detail but, unfortunately, early references in the film to quantum physics are not followed through, leading to a confused message". Despite his caveats, he recommends that people see the movie, stating: [...] "I hope it develops into a cult movie in the UK {{as it has in}} the US. Science and engineering are important for our future, and anything that engages the public can only be a good thing." [...] Simon Singh called it pseudoscience and said the suggestion [...] "that if observing water changes its molecular structure, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> 90% water, then by observing ourselves we can change at a fundamental level via the laws of quantum physics" [...] was [...] "ridiculous balderdash". According to João Magueijo, professor in theoretical physics at Imperial College, the film deliberately misquotes science. The American Chemical Society's review criticizes the film as a [...] "pseudoscientific docudrama", saying [...] "Among the more outlandish assertions are that people can travel backward in time, and that matter is actually thought." ...|$|E
2500|$|The phenomenalist {{phase of}} post-Humean {{empiricism}} ended by the 1940s, for {{by that time}} it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data. [...] If a physical object statement is to be translatable into a sense-data statement, the former {{must be at least}} deducible from the latter. But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement. Remember that the translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. There is, however, no finite set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal. [...] But, of course, the doctor himself must be a normal observer. If we are to specify this doctor's normality in sensory terms, we must make reference to a second doctor who, when inspecting the sense organs of the first doctor, would himself have to have the sense data a normal observer has when inspecting the sense organs of a subject who is a normal observer. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to specify in sensory terms that the second doctor is a normal observer, we must refer to a third doctor, and so on (also see the third man).|$|E
