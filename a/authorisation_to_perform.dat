50|$|The {{remarkable}} {{effectiveness of}} this procedure mainly resides {{in that it is}} ex parte and restrictive. The <b>authorisation</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> a saisie-contrefaçon is requested of the President of the tribunal de grande instance with jurisdiction over the territory in question, in ex parte proceedings. Yet Article R. 211-7 of the French Judicial Organisation Code provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the President of the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris for actions in the fields of Community designs and trademarks. The proceedings are ex parte, i.e. without hearing the other party: the requesting party, represented by its attorney-at-law, presents its request to the judge; the person targeted by the saisie-contrefaçon measure is not informed and does not take part in the proceedings. Therefore, the saisie-contrefaçon ordered by the judge will benefit from the element of surprise; until the very last moment, the targeted person is not informed {{of what is going on}} and therefore cannot move or dispose of the evidence of its infringing activity (the result is the same when, in matters of copyright and related rights, a police commissioner, or even a judge, is requested to carry out a saisie-contrefaçon, see French Intellectual Property Code, Art. L. 332-1 and L. 332-4). The great practical effectiveness of the saisie-contrefaçon also lies in its restrictive nature, since the judge, by granting an order to perform a saisie-contrefaçon, authorises the requesting party to call upon a bailiff to enter the premises of the targeted person or even of third parties (if evidence is likely to be found there) to perform the saisie-contrefaçon investigations, regardless of whether or not the premises are normally open to the public.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the role of Low-threshold {{institutions}} for children and youth (NZDM) in the system of social- legal Child protection, their significance, possibilities and cooperation with other subjects, namely with Department of Social and Legal Protection for Children (OSPOD). The theoretical part defines what the social and legal protection for children is responsible for, how the cooperation between individual subjects work and what notification and information obligations are the subjects bound to fulfil. Attention is also paid to the tasks of OSPOD, NZDM and the role of entrusted persons in the system. The practical part is focused on three main topics. 1) Do the NZDMs have an <b>authorisation</b> <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> social and legal protection of children (and advantages and disadvantages associated with it) ? 2) What is the role of NZDM in the system of Child protection (With what clients they work? How can NZDMs help their clients? And do they cooperate with other subjects) ? 3) How does the cooperation with OSPOD works?The qualitative (interviews) as well as quantitative (questionnaires) methods have been used during the research...|$|E
40|$|Emerging {{real world}} WSNs seldom exist as single owner, single application, {{isolated}} networks, but instead comprise of sensor nodes owned by multiple parties, offering multiple services to {{users in the}} WSN or across the Internet, travelling between multiple WSNs. However, users should only {{have access to a}} limited subset of services, depending on their access rights. Due to a need for direct interactions of users with nodes, authentication and authorisation at the node level is critical. This paper presents an access control infrastructure consisting of three parts: 1) an authentication protocol to ensure authenticity of messages, 2) a role based <b>authorisation</b> framework <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> access control, and 3) a user management service to enable user and permission management. A prototype implementation on the ContikiOS demonstrates the validity and feasibility of node local role based access control on low power micro-controllers. status: publishe...|$|R
