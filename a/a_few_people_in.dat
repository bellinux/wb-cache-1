Among the passengers were the Beatles, {{on their first}} trip to the United States as a band, with their entourage of photographers and journalists, and Phil Spector. When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed JohnF.KennedyAirport, they were greeted by a second large crowd, with Beatles fans again estimated to number four thousand, and journalists, two hundred. From having so many people packed in a little space, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the crowd got injured. The airport had not previously experienced such a large crowd.|$|E

Cody goes over there, but is followed by Santa Claus. The aliens then begin to invade but George stops them by transforming into The Hulk. President Harris tries to hulk out, but ends up soiling his pants. Cindy enters the Logan House, where she is attacked by Tabitha. She is teleported away to Aunt Shaneequa, who teaches her how to defeat Tabitha. Cindy must then confront hundreds of Tabithas. She wins the battle by performing moves from The Matrix and teleports back to the Logan House. The cast then gets into a car with the President, but are horrified to learn that the driver happens to be M. Night Shyamalan.|$|E

2500|$|Rawle {{explained}} that Silas has accepted {{he is to}} be in the secure psychiatric unit until he dies so he plans to manipulate the outside world from inside as a means of living out his murderous fantasies. Rawle revealed that Silas has a [...] "nagging feeling" [...] that he made a mistake in killing India and that he wishes he could put it right. He said that his character meant to murder Texas so he now wants to kill her as she is the [...] "one that got away". Hendrickse-Spendlove also commented that Silas initially intended to kill Texas so she is [...] "the final piece of the puzzle for him, and then his 'work' will be complete". Silas tells Texas another murder will soon occur which is an opportunity to [...] "play games". He is [...] "delighted" [...] to have an audience during the visits and begins to [...] "make lots of threats". Rawle {{explained that}} Silas sees that Texas has India's ring which is [...] "symbolic" [...] for Silas as he had previously taken it as a trophy. Texas taunts Silas with the ring and agrees to exchange it for information on Lynsey's murder. Rawle explained that Silas tells Texas that Will Savage (James Atherton) is responsible for Lynsey's murder which is because [...] "Silas knows that Texas and Will are close, so he points the finger of suspicion his way". He said that Silas would [...] "put quite <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the frame" [...] for the murder. Hendrickse-Spendlove said that Texas is [...] "manipulated" [...] by Silas when he makes her believe Will is responsible for Lynsey's murder. Silas escapes from hospital and goes to visit Texas. Hendrickse-Spendlove explained that Texas [...] "opens her front door, sees Silas and thinks, 'This is it - my life is over', to see him standing there with no police restraint, knowing that he murdered her sister India, is absolutely petrifying". Silas tells Texas that he now intends to complete what he began. Hendrickse-Spendlove would not reveal whether Texas survives the ordeal but said that Texas is [...] "never going to be safe again" [...] regardless of the outcome. In August 2012, Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap confirmed that there were no current plans for Silas to return, but the door had been left open for him. On 20 January 2016, Silas is set to return to visit Trevor Royle (Greg Wood) in prison after he was framed by Lindsey Butterfield (Sophie Austin) for the murders and attempted murders at Dee Valley Hospital. Silas left again after he killed Lindsey.|$|E

60|$|Some {{readers of}} this history will doubtless regard it as {{incredible}} that people should construct matrimonial prospects on the mere report that a bachelor of good fortune and possibilities was coming within reach, and will reject the statement as a mere outflow of gall: they will aver that neither they nor their first cousins have minds so unbridled; and that in fact this is not human nature, which would know that such speculations {{might turn out to}} be fallacious, and would therefore not entertain them.

It was manifest the Benhams were a very bright young couple; he would certainly do something considerable presently, and she was bright and daring, jolly to look at and excellent fun, and, when you came to talk to her, astonishingly well informed. They passed from one hostess's hand to another: they reciprocated. The Clynes people and the Rushtones took her up; Mr. Evesham was amused by her, Lady Beach Mandarin proclaimed her charm like a trumpet, the Young Liberal people made jealous advances, Lord Moggeridge found she listened well, she lit one of the brightest weekend parties Lady Marayne had ever gathered at Chexington. And her descriptions of recent danger and adventure in Albania not only entertained her hearers but gave her just that flavour of personal courage which completes the fascination of a young woman.

[...] "I shouldn't have thought you were hungry, Mrs. Bowen," [...] he said, [...] "if you hadn't told me so," [...] and he recalled that, as a young girl, her friend used to laugh at her for having such a butterfly appetite; she was in fact one of those women who go through life the marvels of such of our brutal sex as observe the ethereal nature of their diet. But in an illogical revulsion of feeling. Colville, who was again cramming himself with all the solids and fluids in reach, and storing up a vain regret against the morrow, preferred her delicacy to the magnificent rapacity of Miss Graham: Imogene had passed from salad to ice, and at his suggestion had frankly reverted to salad again and then taken a second ice, with the robust appetite of perfect health and perfect youth. He felt a desire to speak against her to Mrs. Bowen, he did not know why and he did not know how; he veiled his feeling in an open attack.

6000|$|Mela, {{whom she}} did not admit to her reasons or {{feelings}} always, followed her with the servile admiration she had for all that Christine did; and she took on trust as somehow successful the result of Christine's obstinacy, when {{they were allowed to}} stand against the wall {{at the back of the}} room through the whole of the long piece begun just before they came in. There had been no one to receive them; <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people,</b> <b>in</b> the rear rows of chairs near them, turned their heads to glance at them, and then looked away again. Mela had her misgivings; but at the end of the piece Miss Vance came up to them at once, and then Mela knew that she had her eyes on them all the time, and that Christine must have been right. Christine said nothing about their coming late, and so Mela did not make any excuse, and Miss Vance seemed to expect none. She glanced with a sort of surprise at Conrad, when Christine introduced him; Mela did not know whether she liked their bringing him, till she shook hands with him, and said: [...] "Oh, I am very glad indeed! Mr. Dryfoos and I have met before." [...] Without explaining where or when, she led them to her aunt and presented them, and then said, [...] "I'm going to put you with some friends of yours," [...] and quickly seated them next the Marches. Mela liked that well enough; she thought she might have some joking with Mr. March, for all his wife was so stiff; but the look which Christine wore seemed to forbid, provisionally at least, any such recreation. On her part, Christine was cool with the Marches. It went through her mind that they must have told Miss Vance they knew her; and perhaps they had boasted of her intimacy. She relaxed a little toward them when she saw Beaton leaning against the wall at the end of the row next Mrs. March. Then she conjectured that he might have told Miss Vance of her acquaintance with the Marches, and she bent forward and nodded to Mrs. March across Conrad, Mela, and Mr. March. She conceived of him as a sort of hand of her father's, but she was willing to take them at their apparent social valuation for the time. She leaned back in her chair, and did not look up at Beaton after the first furtive glance, though she felt his eyes on her.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the mean}} time I {{confidently}} {{appeal to the}} reader's imagination {{with the fact that}} there are several men of letters among us who are such good men of business that they can command a hundred dollars a thousand words for all they write. It is easy to write a thousand words a day, and, supposing one of these authors to work steadily, it can be seen that his net earnings during the year would come to some such sum as the President of the United States gets for doing far less work of a much more perishable sort. If the man of letters were wholly a business man, this is what would happen; he would make his forty or fifty thousand dollars a year, and be able to consort with bank presidents, and railroad officials, and rich tradesmen, and other flowers of our plutocracy on equal terms. But, unfortunately, from a business point of view, he is also an artist, and the very qualities that enable him to delight the public disable him from delighting it uninterruptedly. [...] "No rose blooms right along," [...] as the English boys at Oxford made an American collegian say in a theme which they imagined for him in his national parlance; and the man of letters, as an artist, is apt to have times and seasons when he cannot blossom. Very often it shall happen that his mind will lie fallow between novels or stories for weeks and months at a stretch; when the suggestions of the friendly editor shall fail to fruit in the essays or articles desired; when the muse shall altogether withhold herself, or shall respond only in a feeble dribble of verse which he might sell indeed, but which it would not be good business for him to put on the market. But supposing him to be a very diligent and continuous worker, and so happy as to have fallen on a theme that delights him and bears him along, he may please himself so ill with the result of his labors that he can do nothing less in artistic conscience than destroy a day's work, a week's work, a month's work. I know one man of letters who wrote to-day and tore up tomorrow for nearly a whole summer. But even if part of the mistaken work may be saved, because it is good work out of place, and not intrinsically bad, the task of reconstruction wants almost as much time as the production; and then, when all seems done, comes the anxious and endless process of revision. These drawbacks reduce the earning capacity of what I may call the high-cost man of letters in such measure that an author whose name is known everywhere, and whose reputation is commensurate with the boundaries of his country, if it does not transcend them, shall have the income, say, of a rising young physician, known to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> a subordinate city.|$|E
