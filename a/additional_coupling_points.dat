40|$|We {{present a}} method that deforms an image plane to {{visually}} meet the shape and pose of a manifold surface. The user provides constraints that couple {{a small number of}} surface points with their corresponding image pixels to initially deform the plane. Matching, based on geodesic distances, <b>couples</b> <b>additional</b> <b>points,</b> followed by a second deformation that brings the image plane into its final pose and shape. The method works on any type of surface that supports geodesic distances evaluation. This includes not-triangulated and high genus models with arbitrary topology. The result is a smooth, visually pleasing and realistic textured surface that can be superimposed onto or used instead of the original model and with some limitations can be considered as a parameterization or remeshing method for the area of interest. 1...|$|R

ADAK-D tree utilizes AK-D tree twice in different geometrical projection orders to reserve true nearest neighbor points used in later ICP stages.
