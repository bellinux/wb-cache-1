5|$|Her {{position}} {{changed the}} following month. She {{had had a}} series of rows with Bamber. He seemed to want to end the relationship, and they had argued about his involvement in the murders. She told him he was a psychopath and at one point tried to smother him with a pillow. During one argument on 4 September, another woman telephoned Bamber in her presence, and it became clear to Mugford that he had been seeing that woman too. Mugford smashed a mirror, slapped Bamber and he twisted her <b>arm</b> <b>up</b> her back. Three days later she went to the police and changed her statement.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship match followed, with Sheik Abdul Bashir {{defending}} against Consequences Creed. The match lasted 9 {{minutes and}} 18 seconds. Prior to the contest, ring announcer David Penzer introduced Sgt. Daniel Casara, {{who in turn}} introduced Creed. During the bout, Bashir held Creed in a submission hold with the referee attempting to raise Creed's arm three times. If it fell all three times, Bashir would be named the winner. Creed held his <b>arm</b> <b>up</b> on the third try, continuing the match. Bashir won the contest later by pinning Creed with a roll-up pinning maneuver while holding onto the middle rope for leverage. As such, Bashir retained the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
5|$|During the 2007 Stanley Cup playoffs, Hansen {{was called}} {{up by the}} Canucks. He became the first born-and-raised Danish player to compete and {{register}} {{a point in the}} NHL post-season — Frans Nielsen had played and scored the first point by a born-and-raised Dane in the regular season earlier that year. The point was scored in Game 3 of the first round against the Dallas Stars by assisting on a goal by Jan Bulis. The Canucks advanced past the Stars in seven games to meet the Anaheim Ducks in the second round. In Game 5 of the series, with the Canucks facing elimination in overtime, Hansen played an instrumental part on the ice when the Ducks scored. Attempting to carry the puck out of the defensive zone, he was hit to the ice by Ducks forward Rob Niedermayer. While Canucks goaltender Roberto Luongo had his <b>arm</b> <b>up</b> {{in the direction of the}} referee, protesting the lack of penalty, the puck came loose to Ducks defenceman Scott Niedermayer, who scored past the distracted Luongo. Following the Canucks' elimination, Hansen was sent back to the Moose for their 2007 Calder Cup playoffs. Back in the AHL, he was pointless in six games as the Moose were defeated by the Hamilton Bulldogs in the second round.|$|E

25|$|Having {{seen the}} armed blacks, {{some of the}} more than 1,000 whites at the {{courthouse}} went home for their own guns. Others headed for the National Guard armory at Sixth Street and Norfolk Avenue, where they planned to <b>arm</b> <b>up.</b> The armory contained a supply of small arms and ammunition. Major James Bell of the 180th Infantry had already learned of the mounting situation downtown and the possibility of a break-in, and he took appropriate measures to prevent this. He called the commanders of the three National Guard units in Tulsa, who ordered all the Guard members to put on their uniforms and report quickly to the armory. When a group of whites arrived and began pulling at the grating over a window, Bell went outside to confront the crowd of 300–400 men. Bell told them that the Guard members inside were armed and prepared to shoot anyone who tried to enter. After this show of force, the crowd withdrew from the armory.|$|E

25|$|There are a {{large number}} of rules {{regarding}} the specifics of what can and cannot be done during a scrum. This is mainly for safety reasons, because if a scrum is not conducted properly there is a greater chance of injury. Much of the rules regard behaviour of the front row. Front rowers must engage square on, rather than bore in on an angle. The tight-head prop doing this limits the movement of the opposing hooker. As well, a loose-head prop pushing into the opposition tight-head prop's chest causing their body to pop out of the scrum. Both infringements are punished with penalties. Front-rowers are also banned from twisting their bodies, pulling opponents, or doing anything that might collapse the scrum. They must not push an opponent in the air. Finally, the back row must remain bound until the ball has left the scrum. For flankers, this means keeping one <b>arm,</b> <b>up</b> to the shoulder, in contact with the scrum. The no. 8 must have both hands touching the scrum until the scrum has ended.|$|E
25|$|Muralitharan's doosra was {{the subject}} of an {{official}} report by match referee Chris Broad during Australia's tour of Sri Lanka in 2004, for illegal bending of the arm at the elbow during the bowling action. Subsequent biomechanical tests conducted at the University of Western Australia in Perth showed that Muralitharan was straightening his arm by angles of up to 10 degrees prior to delivering doosras, well outside the International Cricket Council (ICC) acceptable guideline of 5 degrees for spin bowlers. (Straightening the bent arm at the moment of delivery imparts added ball speed due to the action of the triceps muscle: {{this is one of the}} ways baseball pitchers generate ball velocity.) Muralitharan was subsequently instructed by Sri Lanka Cricket not to bowl the doosra in international cricket. In November 2004, the International Cricket Council conducted more research into illegal bowling actions and found that many great bowlers like Glenn Mcgrath, Jason Gillespie and Shaun Pollock, whose actions were considered legitimate were actually transgressing the rules. A rule change was proposed and accepted at a meeting of ICC chief executives in early 2005, stating that any bowler may straighten the <b>arm</b> <b>up</b> to 15° (which was earlier 9° for spinners and 12° for seamers) and Muralitharan's doosra once again became a legal delivery.|$|E

It describes the last 10 years of his life, an attempt to find a political movement satisfying his ideals. He considers it an autobiographical film, with Brühl playing Weingartner. The director opted for nonviolence because violence [...] "only makes the system stronger", citing the Baader-Meinhof gang which [...] "practically killed the Left movement in Germany... because they gave the police an excuse to really <b>arm</b> <b>up</b> and create a more totalitarian system."

500|$|The {{interior}} {{also contained}} a pegboard chess board {{connected to a}} pantograph-style series of levers that controlled the model's left arm. The metal pointer on the pantograph moved over the interior chessboard, and would simultaneously move {{the arm of the}} Turk over the chessboard on the cabinet. The range of motion allowed the director to move the Turk's <b>arm</b> <b>up</b> and down, and turning the lever would open and close the Turk's hand, allowing it to grasp the pieces on the board. All of this was made visible to the director by using a simple candle, which had a ventilation system through the model. Other parts of the machinery allowed for a clockwork-type sound to be played when the Turk made a move, further adding to the machinery illusion, and for the Turk to make various facial expressions. A voice box was added following the Turk's acquisition by Mälzel, allowing the machine to say [...] "Échec!" [...] (French for [...] "check") during matches.|$|E
500|$|Director Ardolino {{encouraged}} the actors to improvise and often kept the cameras rolling, even if actors went [...] "off script". One {{example of this}} was the scene where Grey was {{to stand in front}} of Swayze with her back to him and put her <b>arm</b> <b>up</b> behind his head while he trailed his fingers down her arm (similar to the pose seen in the movie poster). Though it was written as a serious and tender moment, Grey was exhausted, found the move ticklish, and could not stop giggling each time Swayze tried it, no matter how many takes Ardolino asked for. Swayze was impatient to finish the scene and found Grey's behavior annoying. However, the producers decided the scene worked as it was and put it into the film, complete with Grey's giggling and Swayze's annoyed expression. It became one of the most famous scenes in the movie, turning out, as choreographer Kenny Ortega put it, [...] "as one of the most delicate and honest moments in the film." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{style of}} play was hard on his left knee, leading to {{injuries}} and surgeries that shortened his career. The left knee took all of the punishment and was operated on [...] "13 or 14" [...] times according to Orr. Orr was a left-hand shot who played the right side. He would race down the right wing with the puck and attempt to beat the opposing defenceman using his speed and strength. He 'protected the puck', leading with his left knee, and holding his left <b>arm</b> <b>up</b> to fend off opponents. This put him into a position where a hit by the opposing defencemen would often hit the left knee. Also, he would often end up crashing into either the opposing goalie, the net or the end boards. [...] "It was the way I played," [...] Orr has said. [...] "I liked to carry the puck {{and if you do}} that, you're going to get hit. I wish I'd played longer, but I don't regret it." [...] Orr stated in 2008. [...] "I had a style—when you play, you play all-out. I tried to do things. I didn't want to sit back. I wanted to be involved." ...|$|E

500|$|Because of his {{aggressive}} style-of-play, Selwood {{has gathered}} {{a reputation as}} a [...] "head–over–the–ball specialist" [...] and for consistently putting himself in positions to break tackles and win free kicks. His ability to [...] "buckle his knees, (get) down and pull his <b>arm</b> <b>up</b> so that the tackler's arm goes up above the neck" [...] has been declared by former Hawthorn captain Shane Crawford as [...] "almost impossible to stop at times" [...] and is reflected in his regular standing among league leaders for total free kicks received. It has also led to opposition players noting specific techniques to tackling Selwood—Carlton’s Kade Simpson admitted it was important to [...] "get in low" [...] because [...] "he’s such a master at lifting the elbows, which tries to slip the tackle up around the neck ... there’s no doubt it’s a skill". Selwood has declared the technique as a [...] "benefit and an advantage I’m getting at the moment on someone else because I see a weakness in what they are doing ... the majority of the time they are doing 95 per cent of the tackle right. It’s just that five per cent where I can use my upper body strength, I can dip at the knees slightly". Former Brisbane Lions captain Michael Voss agrees, stating [...] "all he’s doing is keeping his feet, dropping his legs and he’s got a fantastic tenchique in rolling his shoulder ... Selwood shouldn’t be penalised because he’s stronger than the tackler. If I was playing today and I could develop that technique, I’d be looking at it".|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the run-up}} the bowler will bring his lead foot down on the pitch with the knee as {{straight}} as possible. This aids in generating speed but can be dangerous due to the pressure placed on the joint by this action. Knee injuries are not uncommon amongst fast bowlers: for example, the English pace bowler David Lawrence was sidelined for many months after splitting his kneecap in two. The pressure on the leading foot is such that some fast bowlers cut the front off their shoes to stop their toes from being injured as they are repeatedly pressed against the inside of the shoe. The bowler will then bring their bowling <b>arm</b> <b>up</b> over their head and release the ball at the height appropriate to where they want the ball to pitch. Again, the arm must be straight although this is a stipulation of the laws of cricket rather than an aid to speed. Bending the elbow and [...] "chucking" [...] the ball would make it too easy for the bowler to aim accurately at the batsman's wicket and get them out.|$|E
2500|$|Rather than {{attempt to}} define {{intentions}} in abstraction from actions, thus taking the third heading first, Anscombe {{begins with the}} concept of an intentional action. This soon connected with the second heading. She says that what is up with a human being is an intentional action if the question [...] "Why", taken in a certain sense (and evidently conceived as addressed to him), has application. An agent can answer the [...] "why" [...] question by giving a reason or purpose for her action. [...] "To do Y" [...] or [...] "because I want to do Y" [...] would be typical answers to this sort of [...] "why?"; though they are not the only ones, they are crucial to the constitution of the phenomenon as a typical phenomenon of human life. The agent's answer helps supply the descriptions under which the action is intentional. Anscombe was the first to clearly spell out that actions are intentional under some descriptions and not others. In her famous example, a man's action (which we might observe as consisting in moving an <b>arm</b> <b>up</b> and down while holding a handle) may be intentional under the description [...] "pumping water" [...] but not under other descriptions such as [...] "contracting these muscles", [...] "tapping out this rhythm", and so on. This approach to action influenced Donald Davidson's theory, despite the fact that Davidson went on to argue for a causal theory of action that Anscombe never accepted ...|$|E
