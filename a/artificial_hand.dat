25|$|Tetraplegic Matt Nagle {{became the}} first person to control an <b>artificial</b> <b>hand</b> using a BCI in 2005 as part of the first nine-month human trial of Cyberkinetics’s BrainGate chip-implant. Implanted in Nagle’s right precentral gyrus (area of the motor cortex for arm movement), the 96-electrode BrainGate implant allowed Nagle to control a robotic arm by {{thinking}} about moving his hand as well as a computer cursor, lights and TV. One year later, professor Jonathan Wolpaw received the prize of the Altran Foundation for Innovation to develop a Brain Computer Interface with electrodes located {{on the surface of the}} skull, instead of directly in the brain.|$|E
500|$|Han and {{the others}} go to Cloud City on the planet Bespin to obtain help from Han's friend Lando Calrissian (Mort), [...] "the only black guy in the galaxy", only to {{be turned over to}} Darth Vader. Han willingly reveals the {{location}} of Luke and the Rebel base but is tortured by being forced to listen to Paula Cole's [...] "Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?", as punishment for clogging a toilet on the 16th floor of Cloud City, which forced Vader to use the [...] "little pig people's" [...] bathroom. Han is used to test a carbon freezing chamber Vader intends to use on Luke {{to take him to the}} Emperor. Leia professes her love to Han, but Han tells her to [...] "fuck off" [...] and is then frozen in carbonite for posterity. Lando later double-crosses the Empire, freeing Leia, Chewbacca and C-3PO, motivating the guards with a pizza party. Despite R2-D2 having sex with the combination lock, and subsequently being discovered by her husband, to get the door open, they are too late to stop Boba Fett from flying off with Han. Luke arrives at Cloud City and, after being briefly interrupted by Ryan Seacrest on American Idol, engages Vader in a lightsaber duel. Vader cuts off Luke's right hand. With Luke cornered and defenseless, Vader goads Luke to join the dark side, revealing that he is his father. Luke casts himself into an air shaft and, after discovering that a worker has shoved his severed hand down his pants, ends up hanging on an antenna beneath the city, calling out to Ben, Leia, and Tom Selleck. Leia senses Luke's call from within the Millennium Falcon and has him rescued. On board a Nebulon-B frigate, Luke is fitted with an <b>artificial</b> <b>hand,</b> but told to practice masturbating with a hot dog first. Lando, dressed in Han's clothes, sets off with Chewbacca on the Millennium Falcon to rescue Han. Luke angrily protests the story's ambiguous ending, but then he receives a letter from Doc Brown, a reference to the ending of Back to the Future Part II.|$|E

25|$|The French army doctor Ambroise Paré, born in 1510, {{revived the}} ancient Greek method of tying off blood vessels. After {{amputation}} the common procedure was to cauterize the open {{end of the}} amputated appendage to stop the haemorrhaging. This was done by heating oil, water, or metal and touching it to the wound to seal off the blood vessels. Pare also believed in dressing wounds with clean bandages and ointments, including one he made himself composed of eggs, oil of roses, and turpentine. He {{was the first to}} design <b>artificial</b> <b>hands</b> and limbs for amputation patients.
