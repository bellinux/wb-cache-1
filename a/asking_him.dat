5|$|In 2011, {{the council}} {{complained to the}} Prime Minister David Cameron, <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> to lobby the Committee for the 2012 London Olympics to ensure the Olympic torch passed near Jaywick, {{the only one of}} the ten most {{deprived}} wards in England it would not pass close to.|$|E
5|$|After serving 40 years, Red is paroled. He {{struggles to}} adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache {{containing}} money, and a letter <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas {{to cross the border}} into Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited.|$|E
5|$|All these {{attempts}} {{to mount a}} combined offensive between the Franks and Mongols were too little and too late. In May 1291, the city of Acre was conquered by the Egyptian Mamluks in the Siege of Acre. When Pope Nicholas IV learned of this, he wrote to Arghun, again <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> to be baptized and {{to fight against the}} Mamluks. But Arghun had died on , and Pope Nicholas died as well in March 1292, putting an end to their efforts towards combined action.|$|E

60|$|I <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> what {{he meant}} by coming here to asperse my character. I <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> who the deuce he was. I <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> how he came to know {{anything}} about Mameena, and finally I told him that soon or late I would be even with him, and paused exhausted.|$|R

5|$|Irene Cara, {{a former}} student of the Performing Arts, was cast as Coco Hernandez. Parker was not {{impressed}} with Cara's musical audition, until after her recording sessions with the film's music composer Michael Gore. Gene Anthony Ray, who plays Leroy Johnson, was also a Performing Arts student but had been expelled from the school for disruptive behavior. Simkin had discovered Ray breakdancing on a street corner in Harlem before <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> to audition for a role in the film.|$|E
5|$|Priestley's friends {{wanted to}} find him a more financially secure position. In 1772, {{prompted}} by Richard Price and Benjamin Franklin, Lord Shelburne wrote to Priestley <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> to direct the education of his children and to act as his general assistant. Although Priestley was reluctant to sacrifice his ministry, he accepted the position, resigning from Mill Hill Chapel on 20 December 1772, and preaching his last sermon on 16 May 1773.|$|E
5|$|Several {{years later}} at Chinon, the Dauphin and {{soon to be}} King of France, Charles VII (John Malkovich), {{receives}} {{a message from the}} now adult Joan (Milla Jovovich), <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> to provide an army to lead into battle against the occupying English. After meeting him and his mother-in-law Yolande of Aragon (Faye Dunaway) she describes her visions. Desperate, he believes her prophecy.|$|E

6000|$|We <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> why, {{but he said}} it was no matter. We <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> why, once or twice, as {{we walked}} back to the camp but he still said it was no matter. But late at night, when he was sitting in a {{thoughtful}} mood on the bed, we <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> again and he said: ...|$|R

5|$|After {{a time of}} {{not seeing}} Tigerstar, Sasha returns to her den one evening, only to find Tigerstar already waiting for her. <b>Asking</b> <b>him</b> where he was, he {{comments}} on how nice her den was, and then stops and asks when she will be seeing her humans again, after seeing her collar hanging around a protruding branch on the logs. Sasha asks him why he was snooping around in her den, and he tells her that he cannot see her any more if she has the collar. She refuses to destroy it, and quarrels with Tigerstar about housecats {{and how they are}} not independent. Sad, she reminisces about her perfect life with Jean and Ken.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to Geneva, Knox was chosen to be the {{minister}} at a new place of worship petitioned from Calvin. In the meantime, Elizabeth Bowes wrote to Knox, <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> to return to Margery in Scotland, which he did {{at the end of}} August. Despite initial doubts {{about the state of the}} Reformation in Scotland, Knox found the country significantly changed since he was carried off in the galley in 1547. When he toured various parts of Scotland preaching the reformed doctrines and liturgy, he was welcomed by many of the nobility including two future regents of Scotland, the Earl of Moray and the Earl of Mar.|$|E
5|$|As the Telephone Building {{was being}} {{completed}} in 1925, {{a group of}} Methodist Episcopalians came to Pflueger, <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> to design a new skyscraper containing both a church and a hotel for them at 100 McAllister Street. After a dispute, Miller and Pflueger were fired from the project {{to be replaced by}} Lewis P. Hobart. Miller and Pflueger sued for $81,600, alleging that Hobart's design was not significantly changed from Pflueger's original. Three months after the hotel and church opened in January 1930, Miller and Pflueger won $38,000 in court, equivalent to $ today.|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{is another}} of Father's mysteries. When I <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> about it {{he said that it}} was perhaps the most {{valuable}} thing he had, except one. When I <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> what that one was, he refused to tell me, and forbade me to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> anything concerning it. 'I will tell you,' he said, 'all about it, too, in good time--if I live!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> for it, {{and he told}} it me. I only <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> the two questions, {{what was}} his Chris’en name, and whether he’d a sweetheart? And he answered, Edwin, and he hadn’t.’ ...|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the emperor Nikephoros Botaneiates tried to {{forestall}} the capital's {{fall to the}} Komnenoi by sending for Melissenos and <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> to enter the city and assume imperial authority. His envoys, however, were obstructed by George Palaiologos and never reached Melissenos. Constantinople fell to the Komnenian forces, and on 8 April 1081, Melissenos too entered the imperial capital. True to his word, Alexios I raised him to Caesar and gave him authority over Thessalonica, as well as allotting the city's revenues to his income. At the same time, however, Alexios raised his brother Isaac Komnenos to the newly created dignity of sebastokrator, which he placed above that of Caesar, bypassing Melissenos.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> {{to justify his}} ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming trial {{that he did not}} let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of the}} Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E
5|$|Dejan {{was one of}} the {{prominent}} figures of Dušan's reign and during the subsequent fall of the Serbian Empire, after Dušan's death. Under Emperor Dušan, despot Jovan Oliver, with his brother Bogdan and sevastokrator Dejan, ruled over all of eastern Macedonia. Dejan is not mentioned much in Dušan's military endeavors, although his reputation and that of his successors suggest that he was involved in most of Dušan's successes. His prominence beyond Serbia is also evident from the fact that Pope Innocent VI addressed Dejan in 1355, <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> to support the creation of the union between the Catholic Church and the Serbian Orthodox Church (such letters were sent to the highest nobility and the church).|$|E
6000|$|... "I have <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> {{for nothing}} lately;--though, by George, I intend to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> and that very roundly. Three {{thousand}} pounds isn't {{much of a}} sum of money for your father to have given you." ...|$|R
50|$|As the Muppets are {{watching}} the stars on the roof, Gonzo tells Kermit he wonders why his family <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to build a Jacuzzi. Pepe chuckles because he and Rizzo had pretended to be them and <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to do it.|$|R
5000|$|She {{sometimes}} goes to Kramer for help. She <b>asks</b> <b>him</b> and Newman to {{help her}} {{get rid of a}} neighbor's dog in [...] "The Engagement". In [...] "The Slicer", she <b>asks</b> <b>him</b> first to lose power at her neighbors' house and also feed the cat with meat. In [...] "The Watch" [...] she <b>asks</b> <b>him</b> to pose as her boyfriend so she can dump Dr. Reston, her controlling psychiatrist boyfriend. In [...] "The Soup Nazi", she <b>asks</b> <b>him</b> to watch an armoire for her on the street until she can move it in the following day. The only conflict is in [...] "The 7" [...] over a girl's bicycle where Newman is the judge over the dispute.|$|R
5|$|Edward {{left for}} the Eighth Crusade, led by Louis of France, in 1270, but Henry became {{increasingly}} ill; concerns about a fresh rebellion grew {{and the next year}} the King wrote to his son <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> to return to England, but Edward did not turn back. Henry recovered slightly and announced his renewed intention to join the crusades himself, but he never regained his full health and on the evening of 16 November 1272, Henry died in Westminster, probably with Eleanor in attendance. He was succeeded by Edward, who slowly made his way back to England via Gascony, finally arriving in August 1274.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, Tenney {{played his}} first {{professional}} {{game for the}} Binghamton Bingos of the Eastern League, going 1 for 4 with a single. He played as Brown University's catcher for the 1893 and 1894 seasons. In 1894, the team had a 23–8 record and were selected as national champions by Harper's Weekly. The night of his senior dinner, Tenney received a telephone message from Frank Selee, {{the manager of the}} Beaneaters, <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> to play a game for the team at catcher, due to the injuries of other players.|$|E
5|$|In early 1944, Smyth {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of producing an unclassified report for the general public on the achievements of the Manhattan Project. The director of the Metallurgical Laboratory, Arthur Compton, supported the idea. He arranged a meeting with James B. Conant, the President of Harvard University and one of the senior administrators of the Manhattan Project, who had similar thoughts. Conant took up the matter with the Manhattan Project's director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr.. In April, Smyth received a formal letter from Groves <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> to write such a report. Both the report and the choice of Smyth as its author were approved by the Manhattan Project’s governing body, the Military Policy Committee, in May 1944.|$|E

60|$|Rollo {{himself did}} not {{understand}} it very well. Nathan <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> why it would not split the other way, {{and he said that}} that was across the grain. But when Nathan <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> what he meant by grain, he could not tell.|$|R
5|$|On {{the train}} Sameer meets Suraj Prakash (Satish Shah), who makes him {{think that he}} is a thief by <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> where he keeps {{important}} things (like money) in his luggage. Sameer stays awake all night to avoid being robbed, while Suraj sleeps after conning Sameer into guarding his luggage. Suraj admits this to Sameer the next morning at the station. Sameer learns that Suraj is a security guard at his resort, and puts him on night guard duty for three months. This puts a crimp in Suraj's marriage and, although he apologises, Sameer is adamant.|$|E
5|$|Plans for {{combined}} operations {{between the}} Franks and the Mongols were again {{made for the}} following winter offensives, in 1301 and 1302. But in mid-1301 the island of Ruad was attacked by the Egyptian Mamluks. After a lengthy siege, the island surrendered in 1302 or 1303. The Mamluks slaughtered many of the inhabitants, and captured the surviving Templars {{to send them to}} prison in Cairo. In late 1301, Ghazan sent letters to the pope <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> to send troops, priests, and peasants, to make the Holy Land a Frank state again.|$|E
5|$|Richards' {{addiction}} to heroin delayed {{his arrival in}} Toronto; the other members had already arrived, waiting for him, and sent him a telegram <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> where he was. On 24 February 1977, when Richards and his family flew in from London, they were temporarily detained by Canada Customs after Richards was found {{in possession of a}} burnt spoon and hash residue. Three days later, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, armed with an arrest warrant for Pallenberg, discovered 22 grams of heroin in Richards' room. Richards was charged with importing narcotics into Canada, an offence that carried a minimum seven-year sentence.|$|E
