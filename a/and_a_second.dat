5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> protein when read {{in the opposite direction}} along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E
5|$|A group {{consists}} {{of a set of}} elements and a single operation which combines a first <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> element and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: It must be closed (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated element must also be a member of that set), it must be associative, there must be an identity element (an element which, when combined with another element using the operation, results in the original element, such as adding zero to a number or multiplying it by one), and for every element there must be an inverse element.|$|E
5|$|A ring likewise, has {{a set of}} elements, but now has two {{operation}}s. The first operation {{must make}} the set a group, and the second operation is associative and distributive {{with respect to the}} first operation. It {{may or may not be}} commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> element is the same as to the second and first—the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element x such that ax = xa = 1), the ring is called a division ring. A field is defined as a commutative division ring.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{went on to}} play {{four seasons}} of college {{football}} with the Eastern Kentucky Colonels, {{a member of the}} Division I Football Championship Subdivision (then known as Division I-AA). Starting in 33 games, Adams received several accolades while playing for the Colonels, including being named a Division I-AA third team All-American, a two-time first team All-Conference player, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> team All-Conference player. In September 2002, he was selected as the Ohio Valley Conference Defensive Player of the Week for his effort in a game against the Florida Atlantic Owls, where he made 5 total tackles and repeatedly pressured the quarterback (including for one sack). Adams continued his successful senior year by recording 81 defensive tackles and five sacks.|$|E
5|$|Adi Da {{published}} his fourth book, titled Garbage and the Goddess: The Last Miracles and Final Spiritual Instructions of Bubba Free John.

However, due to the controversial nature of its contents, all available copies were quickly retrieved and ritually burned at Adi Da's behest.|$|E
5|$|After Roger's birth, James and Henriette {{had three}} more children: two daughters {{who died in}} infancy <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> son, Alfred, born in 1839. The {{marriage}} was unhappy, and the couple spent much time apart, he in England, she in Paris with Roger. As a consequence of his upbringing, Roger spoke mainly French, and his English was heavily accented. In 1845 James decided that Roger should complete his education in England and placed him in the Jesuit boarding school Stonyhurst College, where he remained until 1848. In 1849 he sat the British army entrance examinations and then took a commission in the 6th Dragoon Guards, in which he served for three years, mainly in Ireland.|$|E

5|$|After fierce fighting, the Comanches fled. Ross {{and several}} of his men pursued the chief <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> unknown, rider. As the Rangers neared, the second rider slowed and held a child over her head; the men did not shoot, but instead {{surrounded}} and stopped her. Ross continued to follow the chief, eventually shooting him three times. The chief refused to surrender, even after falling from his horse. Ross's cook, Anton Martinez, who had been a captive in Nocona's band, identified the fallen chief as Nocona. With Ross's permission, Martinez fired the shot that took Nocona's life. Nocona was the only Comanche male to die in the fighting; 13 Comanche women were also killed. Ross's men suffered no casualties.|$|E
5|$|After {{several years}} of {{speculation}} on the possibility, Summit Entertainment financed and coordinated {{the development of a}} film in 2011, serving as its distributor. Gavin Hood directed the film, which lasts 1 hour and 54 minutes. Filming began in New Orleans, Louisiana, on February 27, 2012, and was released on November 1, 2013 (USA). A movie preview trailer was released in May 2013 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> trailer was released later that year.|$|E

He served as capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for the Gemini 3 and Gemini 4 missions, and received his first spaceflight assignment in 1966. In 1967, he died in a fire along with fellow astronauts Virgil (Gus) Grissom and Edward H. White II during a pre-launch test for the Apollo 1 mission at what was then the Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34, Florida. He was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> Air Medal.|$|E
5|$|Although Brady and Hindley had {{confessed to}} the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) decided that nothing would be gained by a further trial; as both were already serving life {{sentences}} no further punishment could be inflicted, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> trial might even have helped Hindley's case for parole by giving her a platform from which to make a public confession.|$|E
5|$|An {{argument}} has been advanced that Gediminas had two wives, one pagan and another Orthodox. This case is supported {{only by the}} Jüngere Hochmeisterchronik, a late 15th-century chronicle, mentioning Narimantas as half-brother to Algirdas. Other historians support this claim by arguing this would explain Gediminas' otherwise mysterious designation of a middle son, Jaunutis, as his succession would be understandable if Jaunutis were the first-born son of Gediminas <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> wife.|$|E
