5|$|Medullary bone tissue (endosteally derived, ephemeral, {{mineralization}} located {{inside the}} medulla {{of the long}} bones in gravid female birds) {{has been reported in}} at least one Allosaurus specimen, a shin bone from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Today, this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that <b>are</b> <b>laying</b> eggs, as it is used to supply calcium to shells. Its presence in the Allosaurus individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age. However, other studies have called into question some cases of medullary bone in dinosaurs, including this Allosaurus individual. Data from extant birds suggested that the medullary bone in this Allosaurus individual may have been the result of a bone pathology instead. However, with the confirmation of medullary tissue indicating gender in a specimen of Tyrannosaurus, {{it may be possible to}} ascertain whether or not the Allosaurus in question was indeed female.|$|E

At this moment, the giant is leaning over the city wall of Paris, taunting the population and threatening to destroy them all. Everyone is terrified. Six knights have already sallied out and been slaughtered by this giant. Now he is leaning over the wall again and taunting them all once more.|$|E
25|$|Following hibernation, nests will be {{initiated}} between March and May {{by one or}} two foundresses or queens. During this period, cell construction is high as queens <b>are</b> <b>laying</b> eggs {{at a rate of}} 0.5 eggs per day. Construction by the queen slows down once eggs begin to hatch, but will increase again when pupae appear. If there are two foundresses for the colony, then one becomes the dominant egg-layer and leaves the nest less frequently than the other. Typically, the dominant queen will eat the eggs laid by the other foundress.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the scout}} ant is {{observed}} {{to lay a}} pheromone trail on the return journey to the nest, the other ants seem to be unable to follow this trail {{without the help of}} the scout. The scout ant therefore leads the raid from the front, with the other ants following in a column-like formation. Recruitment time varies between 60 and 300 seconds, with all castes taking part in a raid. During the outward journey towards the termites, all ants <b>are</b> <b>laying</b> a pheromone trail, making it much easier for them to find their way back to the nest later without having to rely on the scout ant.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of medullary bone {{tissue in the}} thigh bone and shin bone of one specimen indicates that tenontosaurs used this tissue, today only found in birds that <b>are</b> <b>laying</b> eggs, in reproduction. Additionally, like Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus, two other dinosaurs known to have produced medullary bone, the tenontosaur individual was not at full adult size upon her death at 8years old. Because the theropod line of dinosaurs that includes Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus diverged from the line that led to Tenontosaurus {{very early in the}} evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that dinosaurs in general produced medullary tissue and reached reproductive maturity before maximum size. A histological study showed that T. tilletti grew quickly early in life and during sub-adult ontogeny, but grew very slowly in the years approaching maturity, unlike other iguanodontians.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} behaviors of species of Parischnogaster is the egg deposition process. The ovipositing female uses an abdominal substance produced by herself to handle the egg. In the first stage, the wasp collects a patch of viscid abdominal substance in her mouth. The patch is then placed into the cell. In the second stage, the wasp bends her abdomen towards her mouth. As the egg emerges from the abdomen the female will grasp it with its mouthparts. The final stage consists of collecting another patch of abdominal substance to place on top of the egg in the cell. This process may have evolved for defense purposes. Since P. alternata typically take on flight as an active defense, this method helps the female save the egg they <b>are</b> <b>laying</b> if disturbed by an attack.|$|E
25|$|Workers plan to pump {{water into}} turbine condensers, but need to pump {{water out of}} them first. Work to {{transfer}} water from the unit 2 and unit 1 condensers to a central storage tank was completed on 9 and 10 April. Workers have also knocked holes through the turbine hall buildings of units 2 and 4 to accommodate hoses for the water transfer. At unit 3, work continues to make space for water in the turbine condenser by pumping existing water into other tanks. Japanese news wire NHK reports that workers <b>are</b> <b>laying</b> hoses to transfer water to an LLW waste processing facility, which continues to be inspected. TEPCO says that it cannot start work switching on emergency systems on site until the turbine hall is dry. NHK also reported that radioactive water filling a tunnel near unit 2 has risen 12cm since a leak in a trench was stopped on Wednesday 6 April.|$|E

In the afternoon it is reported that the unit 4 spent-fuel pool was filled with water {{and none of the}} fuel rods were exposed. Construction work is started to supply a working external electrical power source to all six units of Fukushima I. Starting at 7pm, police and fire water trucks attempt to spray water into the unit 3 reactor with high pressure hoses. Japanese authorities inform the IAEA that engineers <b>are</b> <b>laying</b> an external grid power line cable to unit 2. After watching the helicopter effort on TV Kazunori Hasegawa, president of Chuo Construction, calls the government and offers the use of his two truck-mounted concrete boom pumps to spray water directly into the reactors. TEPCO did not respond for three days, and then stated it would wait for the arrival of similar pumps obtained elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|Welles {{spent the}} first five months of his RKO {{contract}} trying to get his first project going, without success. [...] "They <b>are</b> <b>laying</b> bets over on the RKO lot that the Orson Welles deal will end up without Orson ever doing a picture there," [...] wrote The Hollywood Reporter. It was agreed that Welles would film Heart of Darkness, previously adapted for The Mercury Theatre on the Air, which would be presented entirely through a first-person camera. After elaborate pre-production and a day of test shooting with a hand-held camera—unheard of at the time—the project never reached production because Welles was unable to trim $50,000 from its budget. Schaefer told Welles that the $500,000 budget could not be exceeded; as war loomed, revenue was declining sharply in Europe by the fall of 1939.|$|E

500|$|After Orik's coronation, Eragon and Saphira {{return to}} the elven capital Ellesméra to train. There, Saphira {{revealed}} from a memory that Eragon's deceased mentor, Brom, is Eragon's father; which Brom asked her to show him when the time was right. Oromis and Glaedr too justify Saphira's revelation. Glaedr also reveals the source of Galbatorix's power: Eldunari, or heart of hearts. An Eldunarí allows the holder to communicate with or draw energy from the dragon it belongs to, even if the dragon is deceased, or a great distance away. Galbatorix spent years collecting Eldunari, and forcing the deceased dragons to channel their energy to him through their Eldunari. Saphira is delighted to learn {{of the existence of}} the dragons, although imprisoned by Galbatorix's dark magics. After training, Eragon visits Rhunön, the elven blacksmith who forges swords for Riders. But Rhunön wouldn't create a weapon for him because long ago she swore an oath never to create a weapon again after the Fall of the Riders. Also her stocks of the metal, required to forge rider's swords was completely exhausted. But by deciphering the werecat Solembum's instructions Eragon is able to acquire the metal he requires, from under the roots of the Menoa Tree. After Eragon's repeated requests, Rhunön creates a weapon by controlling Eragon's body. Eragon gives a name to the sword,"Brisingr." [...] As Eragon's body itself forged the sword, a special bond between the sword and Eragon had been created, thus making the sword burst into flames whenever Eragon utters Brisingr, even when he does not intend to use magic. Oromis suspects that [...] "Brisingr" [...] is part of the sword's true name. Before Eragon and Saphira depart for the Varden, Oromis says {{that the time has come}} for him and Glaedr to openly oppose the Empire in combat alongside the Queen of the Elves, Islanzadí. Thus, Glaedr gives his own Eldunari to Eragon. If anything should happen to Glaedr, Eragon would still be able to get advice from him. Then Glaedr and Oromis fly to Gil'ead, while Eragon and Saphira fly to Feinster, the city that the Varden <b>are</b> <b>laying</b> siege to.|$|E

2500|$|Drosnin {{also made}} a number of claims and alleged {{predictions}} that have since failed. Among the most important, Drosnin clearly states in his book [...] "The Bible Code II", published on December 2, 2002, that there was to be a World War involving an [...] "Atomic Holocaust" [...] that would allegedly {{be the end of the}} world. Another claim Drosnin makes in [...] "The Bible Code II" [...] is that the nation of Libya would develop weapons of mass destruction that they would then be given to terrorists who would then use them to attack the West (specifically the United States). In reality Libya improved relations with the West in 2003 and gave up all their existing weapons of mass destruction programs. A final claim Drosnin made in [...] "The Bible Code II" [...] was that Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat would allegedly be assassinated by being shot to death by gunmen which Drosnin specifically stated would be from the Palestinian Hamas movement. This prediction by Drosnin also failed, as Yasser Arafat died on November 11, 2004 of what was later declared to be natural causes (specifically a stroke brought on by an unknown infection). The only conspiracy theories about Yasser Arafat allegedly being murdered have been made by a few Palestinian figures, and have involved alleged poisoning that was supposed to have been on the orders of Israeli officials. The only alleged Palestinian collaboration in this conspiracy theory involve two leading Palestinian figures from the Palestinian Fatah movement; those are current Palestinian Authority and Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas and Mohammed Dahlan the former head of Fatah in Gaza. Writer Randy Ingermanson criticized Drosnin by stating that; [...] "And that's all they are, even for Drosnin – possibilities. He believes that the future is not fixed, and that the Bible code predicts all possible outcomes. Which makes it not much of a predictive tool, but again, he seems not to mind this very much. If you <b>are</b> <b>laying</b> bets based on Drosnin, you had better be willing to bet on all possible outcomes." ...|$|E
