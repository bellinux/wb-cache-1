40|$|Leaching to {{groundwater}} is {{an important}} element of the regulatory risk assessment of pesticides in western countries. Including <b>aged</b> <b>sorption</b> in this assessment is relevant because there is ample evidence of this process and because it leads to a decrease in simulated leaching. This work assesses the likely magnitude of this decrease for four groundwater scenarios used for regulatory purpose in the EU (from the UK, Portugal, Austria and Greece) and for ranges of aged-sorption parameters and substance properties using the PEARL model. Three aged-sorption parameters sets were derived from literature, representing approximately 5 th, 50 th and 95 th percentile cases for the magnitude of the effect of <b>aged</b> <b>sorption</b> on leaching concentrations (called S, M and L, respectively). The selection of these percentile cases was based only on the f NE parameter (i. e. the ratio of the <b>aged</b> <b>sorption</b> and the equilibrium sorption coefficients) because leaching was much more affected by the uncertainty in this parameter than by the uncertainty in the desorption rate coefficient of these sites (k d). For the UK scenario, the annual flux concentration of pesticide leaching at 1 m depth decreased by typically a factor of 5, 30 and > 1000 for the S, M and L parameter sets, respectively. This decrease by a factor of 30 for the M parameter set appeared to be approximately valid also for the other three scenarios. Decreasing the Freundlich exponent N from 0. 9 into 0. 7 for the M parameter set, increased this factor of 30 into a factor of typically 1000, considering all four scenarios. The aged-sorption sites were close to their equilibrium conditions during the leaching simulations for two of the four scenarios (for all substances considered and the M parameter set), but {{this was not the case}} for the other two scenarios. </p...|$|E
40|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{asked the}} Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues {{to prepare a}} {{scientific}} opinion on the Food and Environment Research Agency guidance proposal “Guidance on how <b>aged</b> <b>sorption</b> studies for pesticides should be conducted, analysed and used in regulatory assessments”. The Panel concluded that the experimental and modelling approaches described in the proposed guidance are reasonable compromises between the required effort and what is desirable from a theoretical point of view. However, the Panel has concerns about {{the interpretation of the}} experiments and how the results of the experiments should be used in the leaching assessment. The Panel investigated options for improvement, but could not complete its evaluation on these two topics because underlying data to test these options were not made available to the Panel. For this reason, the Panel prepared a statement instead of a scientific opinion. Therefore, the Panel cannot recommend the use of the guidance for the time being...|$|E
40|$|The {{technique}} {{suggested in}} the present study regarded as an alternative for determining the elastic modulus of polymeric materials. It is based on the solution of a geometrically nonlinear problem of transverse deformation of thin-walled circular cylindrical shells. The account of nonlinear effects makes it possible to use a considerably wider range of the loading curve in the elastic area of deformation, thus increasing the accuracy of results. In addition, we employ the “principle of a unified specimen” i. e., the possibility of measuring the elastic modulus {{as a function of the}} processes proceeding in a specimen and affecting the structure of a polymeric material (<b>aging,</b> <b>sorption,</b> and desorption of liquid media and vapors by the material, temperature variations, etc.) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} effect of {{simulated}} conditions of artificial <b>aging</b> on <b>sorption</b> capacity of two types of biochar. These were produced by slow pyrolysis from different feedstock - beech wood chips (BC A) and garden green waste residues (BC B). Cadmium served {{as a model for}} potentially toxic metals. Twenty freeze-thaw cycles were used to simulate physical aging. The determination of biochar physicochemical properties showed main changes in CEC and SA values of aged sorbents. The maximum <b>sorption</b> capacities of <b>aged</b> BC A sorbent were higher by about 26 % and aged BC B sorbent by about 20 % compared to Qmax of non-aged biochar. Qmax of aged BC B peaked at 9. 4 mg g- 1 whereas BC A sorbed significantly less Cd. FT-IR analyses confirmed the changes in structural composition and content of functional groups on biochar surfaces. The artificial physical aging model was assessed as an efficient tool for investigation of natural weathering conditions...|$|R
40|$|Coprecipitation {{involving}} arsenic {{with aluminum}} or iron {{has been studied}} because this technique is considered particularly efficient for removal of this toxic element from polluted waters. Coprecipitation of arsenic with mixed iron-aluminum solutions has received scant attention. In this work we studied (i) the mineralogy, surface properties,and chemical composition of mixed iron-aluminum oxides formed at initial Fe/Al molar ratio of 1. 0 in the absence or presence of arsenate [As/Fe+Al molar ratio (R) of 0, 0. 01, or 0. 1] and at pH 4. 0, 7. 0, and 10. 0 and aged for 30 and 210 days at 50 degrees C and (ii) the removal of arsenate from the coprecipitates after addition of phosphate. The amounts of short-range ordered precipitates (ferrihydrite, aluminous ferrihydrite and/or poorly crystalline boehmite) were greater than those found in iron and aluminum systems (studied in previous works), due to the capacity of both aluminum and arsenate to retard or inhibit {{the transformation of the}} initially formed precipitates into well-crystallized oxides (gibbsite, bayerite, and hematite). As a consequence, the surface areas of the iron-aluminum oxides formed in the absence or presence of arsenate were usually much larger than those of aluminum or iron oxides formed under the same conditions. Arsenate was found to be associated mainly into short-range ordered materials. Chemical composition of all samples was affected by pH, initial R, and <b>aging.</b> Phosphate <b>sorption</b> was facilitated by the presence of short-range ordered materials, mainly those richer in aluminum, but was inhibited by arsenate present in the samples. The quantities of arsenate replaced by phosphate, expressed as percentages of its total amount present in the samples, were particularly low, ranging from 10 % to 26 %. A comparison of the desorption of arsenate by phosphate from aluminum-arsenate and iron-arsenate (studied in previous works) and iron-aluminum-arsenate coprecipitates evidenced that phosphate has a greater capacity to desorb arsenate from aluminum than iron sites...|$|R
40|$|The {{removal of}} {{orthophosphates}} (10 (- 2) kg P m(- 3)), condensed phosphates (10 - 2 kg P m(- 3)), and mixtures of both (5 x 10 (- 3) kg P m(- 3) as orthophosphate and 5 x 10 - 3 kg P m- 3 as metaphosphate) {{in aqueous solution}} is studied using alum and aluminum hydroxide. The effects of coagulant dose, pH, temperature, aging of aluminum hydroxide, and presence of different ions are investigated. On {{the basis of the}} experimental mental results, alum is much more efficient in phosphorus removal than aluminum hydroxide even if, in both cases, at the conditions studied, the active coagulant form is Al(OH) (3). The differences then could be due to the higher activity of the in situ formed hydroxide. Orthophosphates and metaphosphates seem to have similar behavior vs pH variation: maximum removal is achieved at pH values 5 - 6 in all cases. On the other hand, in the simultaneous presence of both P forms, orthophosphate, and metaphosphate ions have different affinities for the surface sites of aluminum hydroxide, since for both alum and aluminum hydroxide, orthophosphates are preferentially removed compared to metaphosphates, due probably to orientation effects and the charge per P atom. The presence of sodium, potassium, magnesium, sulfate, chloride, and magnesium, at the concentrations studied and for a pH value of 6, does not influence P removal. Temperature variation, between 25 and 60 degrees C, does not affect alum efficiency but both P forms are increasingly removed with increasing temperature, probably due to polymer Al(OH) (3) breaking, producing new surfaces for adsorption. <b>Aging</b> decreases <b>sorption</b> capacity of Al(OH) (3), while crystallites of increasing size are formed. Finally adsorption of both P forms is best described by the Freundlich isotherm [K-F = (49. 1 - 69. 1) x 10 (- 3) (m(3) kg(- 1)) (1 /N), 1 /N: 0. 14 - 0. 19 for T = 25 - 60 degrees C] and [K-F = (1. 58 - 2. 79) x 10 (- 3) (m(3) kg(- 1)) (1 /N), 1 /N: 2. 17 - 2. 47 for T = 25 - 60 degrees C] for orthophosphate and metaphosphate, respectively.

40|$|In {{order to}} predict the {{bioavailability}} of toxic metals in soils undergoing degradation of organic matter (OM) and iron oxides (IOs), {{it is vital to}} understand the roles of these soil components in relation to metal retention and redistribution with time. In this present work, batch competitive sorptions of Pb(II), Cu(II), and Cd(II) were investigated between 1 and 90 days. Results showed that competition affected Cd(II) sorption more than Cu(II) and Pb(II). The sorption followed the trend Pb(II) >[*]>[*]Cu(II) [*]>[*]Cd(II), irrespective of aging, and this high preference for Pb(II) ions in soils reduced with time. Removal of OM led to reduction in distribution coefficient (K d) values of ≈ 33 % for all cations within the first day. However, K d increased nearly 100 % after 7 days and over 1000 % after 90 -day period. The enhanced K d values indicated that sorptions occurred on the long run on surfaces which were masked by OM. Removal of IO caused selective increases in the K d values, but this was dependent on the dominant soil constituent(s) in the absence of IO. The K d values of the IO-degraded samples nearly remained constant irrespective of <b>aging</b> indicating that <b>sorptions</b> on soil components other than the IO are nearly instantaneous while iron oxides played greater role than other constituents with time. Hence, in the soils studied, organic matter content determines the immediate relative metal retention while iron oxides determine the redistribution of metals with time...|$|R
40|$|Sorption-desorption {{interactions}} of pesticides with soil determine their availability for transport, plant uptake, and microbial degradation. These interactions {{are affected by}} the physical-chemical properties of the pesticide and soil, and for some pesticides, their residence time in the soil. This research evaluated changes in sorption/availability of nicosulfuron (2 -[[[[(4, 6 -dimethoxy- 2 -pyrimidinyl]aminolcarbonyl]amino]sulfonyl]-N,N-dimethyl- 3 -pyridinecarboxamide) herbicide with aging in different soils, using a radiolabeled (C- 14) tracer. <b>Aging</b> significantly increased <b>sorption.</b> For instance, after the 41 -day incubation, calculated K-d,K-app increased by a factor of 2 to 3 in Mollisols from the Midwestern United States and by a factor of 5 to 9 in Oxisols from Brazil and Hawaii, as compared to freshly treated soils. In view of this outcome, potential transport of nicosulfuron would be overpredicted if freshly treated soil Kd values were used to predict transport. The fact that the nicosulfuron solution concentration decreased faster than the soil concentration with time suggested that the increase in sorption was because the rate of degradation in solution and on labile sites was faster than the rate of desorption of the neutral species from the soil particles. It may have also been due to nicosulfuron anion diffusion to less accessible sites with time, leaving the more strongly bound neutral molecules for the sorption characterization. Regardless of the mechanism, these results are further evidence that increases in <b>sorption</b> during pesticide <b>aging</b> should be taken into account during the characterization of the sorption process for mathematical models of pesticide degradation and transport...|$|R
40|$|Influence of Water Absorption on the Dielectric Properties and Volume Resistivity of Neat Epoxy Material Anwar Ali Sulaimani Epoxy resins {{are widely}} used {{materials}} in the industry as electrical insulators, adhesives and in aircrafts structural components because of their high mechanical sti ness, strength and high temperature and chemical resistance properties. But still, the in uence of water uptake due to moisture adsorption is not fully understood as it detrimentally modi es the electrical and chemical properties of the material. Here, we investigate the in uence of water moisture uptake on the neat epoxy material by monitoring {{the change in the}} volume resistivity and dielectric properties of epoxy material at three di erent thickness con gurations: 0. 250 mm, 0. 50 mm and 1 mm thicknesses. Gravimetric analysis was done to monitor the mass uptake behaviour, Volume Resistivity was measured to monitor the change in conductivity of the material, and the dielectric properties were mapped to characterise the type of water mechanism available within the material during two <b>ageing</b> processes of <b>sorption</b> and desorption. Two-stage behaviours of di usion and reaction have been identi ed by the mass uptake analysis. Moreover, the plot of volume resistivity versus mass uptake has indi- cated a non-uniform relationship between the two quantities. However, the analysis of the dielectric spectrum at medium range of frequency and time has showed a change 5 in the dipolar activities and also showed {{the extent to which the}} water molecules can be segregated between bounding to the resin or existing as free water...|$|R
40|$|Amendments are {{frequently}} added to agricultural soils to increase organic matter content. In this study, {{we examined the}} influence of alperujo, an olive oil mill waste, {{on the availability of}} two triazine herbicides, terbuthylazine and atrazine, in two different sandy soils, one from Sevilla, Spain, and the other from Minnesota. The effect of <b>aging</b> on herbicide <b>sorption</b> and bioavailability was also studied. Soils were amended with alperujo at a rate of 3 - 5 % (w:w) in laboratory studies. Apparent sorption coefficients for the triazine herbicides were calculated as the ratio of the concentrations of each herbicide sequentially extracted with water, followed by aqueous methanol, at each sampling time. These data showed greater sorption of terbuthylazine and atrazine in amended soils as compared to nonamended soils, and an increase in the amount of herbicide sorbed with increasing aging time in nonamended soils. The triazine-mineralizing bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP was used to characterize triazine bioavailability. Less mineralization of the herbicides by Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP was observed in soils amended with alperujo, as compared to the unamended soils, and, despite the increase in <b>sorption</b> with <b>aging</b> in unamended soils, herbicide mineralization also increased in this case. This has been attributed to Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP first using alperujo as a more readily available source of N as compared to the parent triazines. In summary, addition of alperujo to the soils studied was shown to increase triazine herbicides sorption and hence to reduce its availability and potential to leach. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Per- and polyfluoroalkylated {{substances}} (PFASs) are a {{large group}} of organic chemicals that have gained an increased attention during recent years. Many of the compounds have shown to be persistent, toxic and bioaccumulating and they are found in water, soils, sediments, biota, animals and humans across the globe. The effects of PFASs to humans and animals are still being debated. It is suspected that the compounds can be carcinogenic, disrupt different hormone systems and have other severe effects. The main transport pathways of PFASs to soil are applied PFAS based firefighting foam, soil improvers and waste from industries producing PFASs or PFAS based products. Once the PFASs find their way to the soil the risk for leaching to drinking water supplies and aquatic ecosystems becomes some of the issues of great concern. In {{order to be able to}} evaluate the potential leakage of PFASs from different contaminated soils it is important to know how the PFASs interact with the soil matrix and what parameters that affects these interactions. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of organic carbon (OC), Ca 2 + ions and active carbon (AC) on the n of PFCAs and PFSAs to soil. The PFCAs examined were PFHxA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFOcDA, PFHxDA and PFOcDA and the PFSAs examined were PFBS, PFHxS, PFOS and PFDS. Batch experiments were performed on soils with varying concentrations of TOC, Ca 2 + and AC. The samples were spiked with PFAS native standard solution containing the 12 target PFASs. All studied parameters showed a positive influence on the sorption of PFASs to soil. The AC was found to have the highest influence on the sorption. The OC was however found to be the most important soil parameter influencing the sorption of PFASs to soil. In order to investigate the influence of <b>aging</b> on the <b>sorption</b> of PFASs, batch experiments were also conducted on soils from four different PFAS contaminated sites. The results showed that the aging positively influenced the strength of the interactions between PFASs and soil. The organic carbon normalized distribution coefficients (Koc) showed a positive correlation with the carbon chain length of the PFAS molecules and also with the substitution of a carboxylic group with a sulfonic group. The log Koc values calculated in this study decreased in the following order PFDS (log Koc 3. 8 0. 3) > PFOS > (log Koc 2. 8 0. 3) > PFUnDA (log Koc 3. 2 0. 2) > PFDA (log Koc 2. 7 0. 1) > PFNA (log Koc 2. 0 0. 1) > PFHxS (log Koc 1. 9 0. 1) > PFOA (log Koc 1. 8 0. 3) > PFHxA (log Koc 1. 6 0. 3) > PFBS (log Koc 1. 5 0. 2). The log Koc values found in this study were within the range of previously reported log Kocvalues...|$|R
40|$|Photo-acoustic (PA) {{detection}} is a non-destructive, non-disruptive mode {{of sample}} analysis. The principle of PA detection is monitoring {{the change in}} thermal properties of the material {{as a result of}} optical absorption. The ability to use with any incident radiation source makes it an attractive technique to study molecular excitations, vibrations and defects in any sample. Given the need for non-destructive analysis, the tool can be employed to study plethora of samples ranging from organic to inorganic. In the polymeric domain, there is a significant need for studying samples non-destructively with the architecture intact. For instance, molecular characterization in carbon fiber reinforced polymer, chemical diffusion in polymer resin/membrane and particulate/fillers incorporated thermosets suffer in characterization due to sample make-up. These samples are affected by opacity and thickness, which make them a very difficult set-up to study using conventional spectroscopic tools. We have employed PA mode of detection in tandem with a FTIR source to study the molecular vibrations to get an understanding of the systems considered. ^ The first part of the work involved employing PA spectroscopy to study the curing in carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). Phenyl-ethynyl terminated oligoamic acid impregnated composite system was studied. The curing of composite and resin was monitored using PAS and compared with Transmission FTIR on resin and dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC). The composite showed two distinct reactions as a function of thermal treatment. (1) Imidization at low temperatures due to cyclo-dehydration and (2) at high temperatures, crosslinking due to ethynyl addition reaction. Composite exhibited enhanced curing trends compared to neat resin. Our results indicate that the thermal conductivity of the carbon fiber might play a role in heat transfer facilitating the reaction. The activation energy was found to be 23 kcal/mol for the crosslinking step. The order of the kinetic rates agreed to a good extent with literature reports implying the mechanistic aspect is retained in composite. ^ The second part of the work focused on the diffusion studies. With the capability of depth profiling using PAS, we were able to demonstrate the sorption trend as a function of depth in epoxies. The samples used were physically aged and the apparent diffusion constant was found to be of the order of 10 - 10 cm 2 /s. The lower value of the diffusion constant was attributed to poor relaxation capability due to <b>ageing.</b> The initial <b>sorption</b> trend was modeled on the basis of Fickian diffusion and the trend correlated well with the gravimetry analysis. Time evolution of water sorption in PAS correlated well with gravimetry technique. ^ The third aspect of the work involved curing studies in nanocomposites. With the recent trend being controlling active nano-domains for better applicability and processing of materials. We were able to employ PAS to study the curing trend in carbon nanotube dispersed thermosets. DSC studies showed the existence of two glass transition temperatures, which we believe might be due to relaxation in homopolymers and relaxation of polymeric segment close to the nanotube surface. We were able to study the curing aspect of the filler reinforced thermoset and found that the surface curing displayed a higher crosslinking compared to the bulk. ...|$|R
