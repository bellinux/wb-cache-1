40|$|Abstract Introduction Intracranial <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> are {{considered}} to be congenital malformations with a predilection for the temporal fossa. They are often asymptomatic but can sometimes be symptomatic due to enlargement or hemorrhage. There are multiple case reports of <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> becoming symptomatic with hemorrhagic complications following head trauma. In such cases, the bleeding is often confined to the side ipsilateral to the <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst.</b> Occurrence of contralateral subdural hematomas in patients with temporal fossa <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> has rarely been observed and is reported less frequently in the medical literature. Case presentation We report two cases of people (a 23 -year-old man and a 41 -year-old man) with temporal fossa <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> complicated by a subdural hematoma following head injury. Both patients developed a subdural hematoma contralateral to the side of a temporal fossa <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst.</b> It is likely that lack of adequate intracranial cushioning in the presence of an intracranial <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> may result in injury not only to ipsilateral but also to contralateral bridging veins, following head trauma.

40|$|Background: There {{is little}} {{knowledge}} concerning {{the content and}} the mechanisms of filling of <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the protein content of <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> and cerebrospinal fluid by quantitative proteomics to increase the understanding of <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts.</b> Methods: <b>Arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> fluid and cerebrospinal fluid from five patients were analyzed by quantitative proteomics in two separate experiments. In a label-free experiment <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> fluid and cerebrospinal fluid samples from individual patients were trypsin digested and analyzed by Orbitrap mass spectrometry in a label-free manner followed by data analysis using the Progenesis software. In the second proteomics experiment, a patient sample pooling strategy was followed by MARS- 14 immunodepletion of high abundant proteins, trypsin digestion, iTRAQ labelling, and peptide separation by mix-phase chromatography followed by Orbitrap mass spectrometry analysis. The results from these analyzes were compared to previously published mRNA microarray data obtained from arachnoid membranes. Results: We quantified 348 proteins by the label-free individual patient approach and 1425 proteins in the iTRAQ experiment using a pool from five patients of <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> fluid and cerebrospinal fluid. This is by far the largest number of <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> fluid proteins ever identified, and the first large-scale quantitative comparison between the protein content of <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> fluid and cerebrospinal fluid from the same patients at the same time. Consistently in both experiment, we found 22 proteins with significantly increased abundance in <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> compared to cerebrospinal fluid and 24 proteins with significantly decreased abundance. We did not observe any molecular weight gradient over the <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> membrane. Of the 46 proteins we identified as differentially abundant in our study, 45 were also detected from the mRNA expression level study. None of them were previously reported as differentially expressed. We did not quantify any of the proteins corresponding to gene products from the ten genes previously reported as differentially abundant between <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> and control <b>arachnoid</b> membranes. Conclusions: From our experiments, the protein content of <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> fluid and cerebrospinal fluid appears to be similar. There were, however, proteins that were significantly differentially abundant between <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> fluid and cerebrospinal fluid.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> are congenital, {{benign and}} intra-arachnoidal lesions. A great {{majority}} of <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> are congenital. However, to a lesser extent, they are known to develop after head trauma and brain inflammatory diseases. <b>Arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> are mostly asymptomatic and they can develop anywhere in the brain along the arachnoid membrane. CASE REPORT: <b>Arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> form 1 % of the non-traumatic lesions which occupy a place and it {{is thought to be}} a congenital lesion developed as a result of meningeal development abnormalities or a lesion acquired after trauma and infection. There is a male dominance at a rate of 3 / 1 in <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> which locate mostly in the middle fossa. Our patient was a 2 -years-old boy.

40|$|It is {{very rare}} that a foramen magnum <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> induces {{compression}} of the spinal cord and syringomyelia, and currently there are few treatment experiences available. Here we reported {{the case of a}} 43 -year-old male patient who admitted to the hospital due to weakness and numbness of all 4 limbs, with difficulty in urination and bowel movement. MRI revealed a foramen magnum <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> with associated syringomyelia. Posterior fossa decompression and <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> excision were performed. Decompression was fully undertaken during surgery; however, only the posterior wall of the <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> was excised, because it was almost impossible to remove the whole <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> due to toughness of the cyst and tight adhesion to the spinal cord. Three months after the surgery, MRI showed a reduction {{in the size of the}} <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> but syrinx still remained. Despite this, the symptoms of the patient were obviously improved compared to before surgery. Thus, for the treatment of foramen magnum <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> with compression of the spinal cord and syringomyelia, if the <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> could not be completely excised, excision should be performed as much as possible with complete decompression of the posterior fossa, which could result in a satisfying outcome. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> are {{relatively}} common congenital intracranial mass lesions that arise {{during the development}} of the meninges. They can be complicated by the formation of an ipsilateral chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) after minor cranial trauma. Treatment of these coexisting conditions remains controversial. In this study the authors describe the anatomical, clinical, and neuroradiological features and outcome in a series of patients whose CSDH associated with <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> were managed surgically by draining the hematoma alone and leaving the cyst intact. The authors based this surgical management on histological and neuroradiological observations concerning these associated medical conditions.

40|$|<b>Arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> are benign {{intracranial}} lesions with {{a reported}} prevalence up to 1. 1 % in the population. The origin of such cysts and {{the mechanisms of}} filling and sustaining are poorly understood. The aim of the thesis was to characterize the <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> fluid and compare it with cerebrospinal fluid from the same individuals to evaluate the content of <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts,</b> {{as well as to}} gain further knowledge of the mechanisms of filling and sustaining of such cysts. Patients were recruited prior to elective surgery for fenestration of symptomatic <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> in the temporal fossa and <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> fluid and cerebrospinal fluid was collected with written informed consent from 19 patients. In Paper I the content of <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> fluid and cerebrospinal fluid from the same patients were compared by clinical chemistry. The protein content of <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> fluid is reduced relative to cerebrospinal fluid, while the concentration of phosphate is elevated. The results from this evaluation indicated that <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> fluid is not identical to cerebrospinal fluid. In Paper II the protein content in <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> fluid from 15 patients was evaluated by qualitative proteomics and the findings were compared with published databases of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. These comparisons indicated that the <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> fluid proteome was similar to cerebrospinal fluid, but dissimilar to plasma. In Paper III we performed a quantitative comparison of the proteomes of <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> fluid and cerebrospinal fluid for five patients. 348 proteins were quantified in individual patients, and 1425 proteins in a pool of the same patients using an iTRAQ-strategy combined with extensive fractionation. We identify differences between the fluids, but currently we are not able to elute the biological significance. Searched against DNA and mRNA-data, we find some differences, but not in patterns of biological significance. This is the first quantitative proteomics comparison of AC fluid and CSF.

40|$|<b>Arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> are benign {{developmental}} anomalies of {{the central}} nervous system and arise in virtually all locations where arachnoid membrane exists. It is reported that they account for approximately 1 % of all intracranial lesions and are caused by the splitting of the arachnoid membrane. Many authors have indicated that <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> typically remain constant in size or grow very slowly. Therefore, most opportunities to detect <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> are incidental. However, recent advent of more advanced imaging techniques has increased the frequencies to find them. The enlargement of <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> are reported to occur most frequently in patients under 5 years of age, and the symptoms and signs derived from <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> include elevated intracranial hypertension and focal signs due to the effects of compression to the surrounding cerebral parenchyma. Even in cases in which neurological symptoms are present, {{it is often difficult to}} properly correlate nonspecific signs and symptoms with the findings of <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts.</b> This is especially true in the cases common symptoms, such as headache, that arise frequently in the general population. In most of the cases, <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> usually bring with a thin and bulging inner table of the skull. These bone deformities suggest a long process accompanying a gradual increase in intracystic pressure that probably begins in early infancy. Three mechanisms of the <b>cyst</b> expansion in <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> have been described by many authors as follows: First, osmotic gradient between the cyst and the surrounding subarachnoid space induced fluid influx into the cyst cavity; second, fluid is secreted from ependymal cells on the cyst wall; third, a one-way ball-valve mechanism develops on the cyst wall. Almost symptomatic <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> belong in children, the progressive growth of the skull and plasticity of the brain in children can buffer the mass effect caused by the <b>cysts.</b> Therefore, the <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> in children and adolescence are usually asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. The patient’s symptoms develop once the breakdown of compensatory mechanism in the brain surrounding the <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> happens. Even in elderly patients with or without cyst expansion, the breakdown of compensatory mechanisms can lead to relatively rapid progression of symptoms. However, the factors that induce the breakdown of compensatory capacity remain unknown. In addition to those mechanisms, the symptomatic <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cyst</b> infrequently associates with intracranial hematoma, such as chronic subdural hematoma, acute subdural hematoma, acute epidural hematoma, and intra-cyst wall hematoma. Especially, it is well known that <b>arachnoid</b> <b>cysts</b> located in the middle cranial fossa can present with chronic subdural hematoma. The hematomas are frequently induced by minor trauma.
