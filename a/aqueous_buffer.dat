25|$|Common {{mobile phases}} used include any {{miscible}} combination {{of water with}} various organic solvents (the most common are acetonitrile and methanol). Some HPLC techniques use water-free mobile phases (see Normal-phase chromatography below). The aqueous component of the mobile phase may contain acids (such as formic, phosphoric or trifluoroacetic acid) or salts {{to assist in the}} separation of the sample components. The composition of the mobile phase may be kept constant ("isocratic elution mode") or varied ("gradient elution mode") during the chromatographic analysis. Isocratic elution is typically effective in the separation of sample components that are very different in their affinity for the stationary phase. In gradient elution the composition of the mobile phase is varied typically from low to high eluting strength. The eluting strength of the mobile phase is reflected by analyte retention times with high eluting strength producing fast elution (=short retention times). A typical gradient profile in reversed phase chromatography might start at 5% acetonitrile (in water or <b>aqueous</b> <b>buffer)</b> and progress linearly to 95% acetonitrile over 5–25 minutes. Periods of constant mobile phase composition may be part of any gradient profile. For example, the mobile phase composition may be kept constant at 5% acetonitrile for 1–3 min, followed by a linear change up to 95% acetonitrile.|$|E

2500|$|A {{variation}} of the static method is to add a solution of the substance in a non-aqueous solvent, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, to an <b>aqueous</b> <b>buffer</b> mixture. Immediate precipitation may occur giving a cloudy mixture. The solubility measured for such a mixture is known as [...] "kinetic solubility". The cloudiness {{is due to the}} fact that the precipitate particles are very small resulting in Tyndall scattering. In fact the particles are so small that the particle size effect comes into play and kinetic solubility is often greater than equilibrium solubility. Over time the cloudiness will disappear as the size of the crystallites increases, and eventually equilibrium will be reached in a process known as precipitate ageing.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrophobic {{interactions}} between proteins and the chromatographic matrix can be exploited to purify proteins. In hydrophobic interaction chromatography the matrix material is lightly substituted with hydrophobic groups. These groups {{can range from}} methyl, ethyl, propyl, octyl, or phenyl groups. At high salt concentrations, non-polar sidechains on the surface on proteins [...] "interact" [...] with the hydrophobic groups; that is, both types of groups are excluded by the polar solvent (hydrophobic effects are augmented by increased ionic strength). Thus, the sample {{is applied to the}} column in a buffer which is highly polar. The eluant is typically an <b>aqueous</b> <b>buffer</b> with decreasing salt concentrations, increasing concentrations of detergent (which disrupts hydrophobic interactions), or changes in pH.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mobile phase}} {{composition}} {{does not have}} to remain constant. A separation in which the mobile phase composition is changed during the separation process is described as a gradient elution. One example is a gradient starting at 10% methanol and ending at 90% methanol after 20 minutes. The two components of the mobile phase are typically termed [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B"; A is the [...] "weak" [...] solvent which allows the solute to elute only slowly, while B is the [...] "strong" [...] solvent which rapidly elutes the solutes from the column. In reversed-phase chromatography, solvent A is often water or an <b>aqueous</b> <b>buffer,</b> while B is an organic solvent miscible with water, such as acetonitrile, methanol, THF, or isopropanol.|$|E

2500|$|The {{instrumentation}} {{needed to}} perform capillary electrophoresis is relatively simple. [...] A basic schematic of a capillary electrophoresis system {{is shown in}} figure 1. [...] The system's main components are a sample vial, source and destination vials, a capillary, electrodes, [...] a high voltage power supply, a detector, and a data output and handling device. The source vial, destination vial and capillary are filled with an electrolyte such as an <b>aqueous</b> <b>buffer</b> solution. [...] To introduce the sample, the capillary inlet is placed into a vial containing the sample. [...] Sample is introduced into the capillary via capillary action, pressure, siphoning, or electrokinetically, and the capillary is then returned to the source vial. [...] The migration of the analytes is initiated by an electric field that is applied between the source and destination vials and is supplied to the electrodes by the high-voltage power supply. [...] In the most common mode of CE, all ions, positive or negative, are pulled through the capillary in the same direction by electroosmotic flow. [...] The analytes separate as they migrate due to their electrophoretic mobility, and are detected near the outlet end of the capillary. The output of the detector is sent to a data output and handling device such as an integrator or computer. The data is then displayed as an electropherogram, which reports detector response as a function of time. Separated chemical compounds appear as peaks with different retention times in an electropherogram. [...] Capillary electrophoresis was first combined with mass spectrometry by Richard D. Smith and coworkers, and provides extremely high sensitivity for the analysis of very small sample sizes. [...] Despite the very small sample sizes (typically only a few nanoliters of liquid are introduced into the capillary), high sensitivity and sharp peaks are achieved in part due to injection strategies that result in concentration of analytes into a narrow zone near the inlet of the capillary. [...] This is achieved in either pressure or electrokinetic injections simply by suspending the sample in a buffer of lower conductivity (e.g. lower salt concentration) than the running buffer. [...] A process called field-amplified sample stacking (a form of isotachophoresis) results in concentration of analyte in a narrow zone at the boundary between the low-conductivity sample and the higher-conductivity running buffer.|$|E
2500|$|This study {{involves}} {{creating a}} combination of model membranes which contain 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 1,2-distearoly-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) {{referred to as the}} [...] "host membranes", phospholipids labeled as 1,2,& 3 referred to as [...] "exchanging molecules" [...] or [...] "reporting molecules" [...] and varied cholesterol mole percentages in the presence of an aqueous solution containing 5% ethanol (v/v). The host membranes were chosen because their phase diagrams are well understood and have been extensively characterized by different analytical techniques.6 The nearest neighbor recognition technique is being applied to the formation of the modeled membranes to observe the association between cholesterol and phospholipids as well as the effects that the presence of ethanol has against this interaction. Researchers are observing whether or not ethanol enhances or disrupts the liquid-ordered phase by reorganizing this formation into a liquid-disordered phase. The liquid-ordered phase is similar to a lamellar phase and the liquid-disordered phase represents the non-lamellar phases but the exact type of each phase (hexagonal, cubic, etc.) is not described. As previously mentioned several different combinations of the host membranes, exchanging molecules, and cholesterol are created to form the model membranes. It's important to mention that the exchanging molecules selected have similar properties to the host membranes. The exchanging lipids contain disulfide bonds as well as diacylglycerol groups that are not necessarily present in the host membranes. Studies provide evidence through monolayer measurements, condensing properties, and nearly identical gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition temperatures (Tm) to the host membranes that the presence of these bonds do not play a major role or interfere in the recognition or packing formation of the modeled membranes in the presence of ethanol. The disulfide bonds, diacylglycerol bonds, and similar sterol framework are only present to mimic the physical properties of DSPC, DPPC, and cholesterol as well as aid in the monomer exchanging processes to form exchangeable dimers. The exchangeable lipids undergo a monomer interchanging process through the disulfide bridges in which they either mix ideally, homogenously, or heterogeneously. Their interactions are measured by the equilibrium constant (K) which will be described in further detail under the significance of results section. Overall, the monomer interchanging process is necessary in order to demonstrate the nearest neighbor recognition technique effective by observing changes in the phase composition of the host membranes/phospholipids. Each model membrane consists of a high concentration of one of the host membranes/phospholipids (95% mol %), low concentrations of two exchanging lipids (2.5mol% each for a total of 5%), varied mole percentages of cholesterol (0–30mol %) plus a constant concentration of ethanol (5% v/v). An <b>aqueous</b> <b>buffer</b> solution contains the 5% ethanol (v/v) which is desired but due to evaporation the value is lowered to approximately 2.9% ethanol.|$|E
