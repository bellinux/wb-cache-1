6000|$|... "You dare to ask <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>son</b> after Steve? How clumsy that sounds! I {{mean you}} dare to put Steve before your son. I believe you've only just {{realized}} {{that you have}} a son." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you happen}} to know anything," [...] asked Mr Larks, as he {{prepared}} to follow, [...] "about a man of the name of Jones? I have come to inquire particularly about him, and <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> who, I am told--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are honest, Shabaka, and I believe you. But how <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>sons,</b> if {{you have}} any, and how about Amada herself? Well, in great {{businesses}} something must be risked, and I need the gold and the rest which I cannot take for nothing, for you won them by your skill and courage and they are yours. But how you won the seal you have not told us, nor is there {{time for you to}} do so now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought perhaps}} a few words, though from a stranger, <b>about</b> <b>your</b> [...] <b>son,</b> from one who was {{with him at the}} last, might be worth while, for [...] I loved the young man, though I but saw him {{immediately}} to lose him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{never made}} any effort to know more <b>about</b> what <b>your</b> <b>son</b> was doing or how he was living?" [...] {{suggested}} the coroner, who, though accustomed to this same quiet philosophy in {{men and women of}} that class, was nevertheless strangely moved in this instance by the expression of a fatalism that carried in its train such extraordinary consequences.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought perhaps}} a few words, though from a stranger, <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> from one who was {{with him at the}} last, might be worth while, for I loved the young man, though I but saw him {{immediately}} to lose him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you could}} not {{have come to a}} better place," [...] said Tufnell, [...] "for Miss Robinson and all her helpers sympathise deeply with soldiers. If any one can find out <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> they can. How were you led to suspect that he had come to Portsmouth?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thought perhaps}} a few words, though from a stranger, <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> from one who was {{with him at the}} last, might be worth while--for I loved the young man, though I but saw him {{immediately}} to lose him. I am merely a friend visiting the hospitals occasionally to cheer the wounded and sick.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{was news}} to-day,' {{returned}} Hugh. 'Your son was at our house--came down on horseback. He {{tried to see}} the young woman, but couldn't get sight of her. He left some letter or some message which our Joe had charge of, but he and the old one quarrelled <b>about</b> it when <b>your</b> <b>son</b> had gone, and the old one wouldn't let it be delivered. He says (that's the old one does) that none of his people shall interfere and get him into trouble. He's a landlord, he says, and lives on everybody's custom.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] Lady Maiden had said, having {{told the}} pale {{daughter}} {{to go into}} the conservatory, [...] "I'm the last person in the world to repeat gossip, as you know; but I think it's only right to tell you that I've been hearing things. You see, my boy Fred" [...] (who would ultimately become Sir Frederick Maiden) [...] "belongs to the same club as <b>your</b> <b>son</b> George--the Stoics. All young men belong there of course-I mean, if they're anybody. I'm sorry to say there's no doubt <b>about</b> it; <b>your</b> <b>son</b> has been seen dining at--perhaps I ought not to mention the name--Blafard's, with Mrs. Bellew. I dare say you don't know what sort of a place Blafard's is--a lot of little rooms where people go when they don't want to be seen. I've never been there, of course; but I can imagine it perfectly. And not once, but frequently. I thought I would speak to you, because I do think it's so scandalous of her in her position." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> O-Tar," [...] E-Thas {{reminded}} him, [...] "nor {{is there}} a more beloved man in Manator--I but speak to you of facts {{which may not be}} ignored, and I dare do so because only when you realize the truth may you seek a cure for the ills that draw <b>about</b> <b>your</b> throne." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate, I must beg you not {{to trouble}} me any more about the matter. When I {{was a young man}} your husband read with me for a few months; and I really think that two presentations to the living have been a {{sufficient}} payment for that. I know nothing <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> and I don't want to know anything. I dare say he's as good as most other clergymen--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My news is this," [...] Mat broke in: [...] "Your son's {{been hurt}} in the head, but he's got over {{the worst of it}} now. He lives with me; I like him; and I mean {{to take care of him}} till he gets on his legs again. That's my news <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>son.</b> But that's not all I've got to say. I bring you news of {{somebody}} else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] he answered: [...] "I remembered <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> {{and so did}} Higgs. In fact, {{he spoke}} of him first--they seem to have become friends. He {{said he would not}} escape without him, and could fetch him in a moment, as he was only just below. Well, he went to do so, and must have found the guard instead, who, I suppose, had heard us talking. You know as much about the rest as I do. To-night, when the full moon is two hours high, there is to be a {{ceremony}} of sacrifice, and poor Higgs will be let down into the den of lions. He was writing his will in a note-book when we saw him, as Barung had promised to send it to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before {{you tell}} us aught that has befallen you, John, go and change your garments, and wash, while we prepare a meal for you. The clothes of <b>your</b> uncle's <b>son</b> Silas, who is <b>about</b> <b>your</b> age, will fit you; and those of his younger brother will do for your friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Believe it or not, {{it is the}} truth, and I {{have the}} three boys to prove it, and {{likewise}} Professor Potts's ruined suit of clothing. Now," [...] continued the manufacturer, [...] "I know all <b>about</b> <b>your</b> charge against Dave. I'll not say that he wasn't careless, because he was. But he meant no harm, {{and it is going}} too far to have him arrested. It would be much fairer for Professor Potts to have <b>your</b> <b>son</b> locked up, and make you pay for the suit of clothing in the bargain. Now, the professor thinks a great deal of Dave, and he is willing to drop his complaint against Nat if you'll drop your complaint against Dave." ...|$|R
50|$|Clauses can be {{nested within}} each other, {{sometimes}} {{up to several}} levels. For example, the sentence I know the woman who says she saw <b>your</b> <b>son</b> drinking beer contains a non-finite clause (drinking beer) within a content clause (she saw <b>your</b> <b>son</b> drinking beer) within a relative clause (who says she saw <b>your</b> <b>son</b> drinking beer) within an independent declarative clause (the whole sentence).|$|R
6000|$|... "What are ye talkin' about?" [...] {{interrupted}} the first speaker. [...] "I tell you I KNOW. Look at these pictures. I found 'em on his body. Look at 'em. Pictures {{of you and}} your girl. Pr'aps you'll deny them. Pr'aps you'll tell me I lie when I tell you HE told me he was your son; told me how he ran away from you; how you were livin' somewhere in the mountains makin' gold, or suthin' else, outer charcoal. He told me who he was as a secret. He never let on he told it to any one else. And when I found that the man who killed him, Lance Harriott, had been hidin' here, had been sendin' spies all around to find out all <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> had been foolin' you and tryin' to ruin your gal as he had killed your boy, I knew that HE knew it, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|This made matters worse. [...] "Daughters always daughters!" [...] {{came the}} quick rejoinder. [...] "I never learned that before. What, my son take {{up with a}} girl and leave his old mother to starve {{or go to the}} workhouse! I never heard such a foolish thing said in my life!" [...] And, being now quite angry, she looked round for her basket and shawl so as to get away as quickly as {{possible}} from that insulting woman; but the other, guessing her intention, was too quick for her and started at once to the gate, but after going four or five steps turned and delivered her last shot: [...] "Say what you like <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> and I don't doubt he's been good to you, and I only hope it'll always be the same; but what I say is, give me a daughter, and I know, ma'am, that if you had a daughter you'd be easier in your mind!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Two {{pounds of}} coffee, if you please, Mrs. Oswald,' she {{began with a}} quaver; 'coffee, mind, I say, not chicory; your stuff always has the {{smallest}} possible amount of flavour in it, it seems to me, for the largest possible amount of quantity; all chicory, all chicory--no decent coffee to be had now in Calcombe Pomeroy. So your son's at home this week, is he? Out of work, I suppose? I saw him lounging about on the beach, idling away his time, yesterday; pity he wasn't at some decent trade, instead of hanging about and doing nothing, {{as if he was}} a gentleman. Five pounds of lump sugar, too; good lump sugar, though I expect I shall get nothing but beetroot; it's all beetroot now, my brother tells me; they've ruined the West Indies with their emancipation fads and their differential duties and the Lord knows what--we had estates in the West Indies ourselves, all given up to our negroes nowadays--and now I believe they have to pay the French a bounty or something of the sort to induce them to make sugar out of beetroot, because the negroes won't work without whipping, so I understand; that's what comes in the end of your Radical fal-lal notions. Well, five pounds of lump, and five pounds of moist, though the one's as bad as the other, really. A great pity <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>son.</b> I hope he'll get a place again soon. It must be a trial to you to have him so idle!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'From {{what passes}} in our house,' said Mr Tappertit, 'I am aware, sir, that <b>your</b> <b>son</b> keeps {{company with a}} young lady against your inclinations. Sir, <b>your</b> <b>son</b> has not used me well.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Madame,' said Blandois, 'do me the honour {{to present}} me to Monsieur, <b>your</b> <b>son.</b> It appears to me, madame, that Monsieur, <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> is {{disposed}} to complain of me. He is not polite.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Gen 22:12 of Symmachus [...] "now I {{know that}} you fear God, seeing you have not {{withheld}} <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> <b>your</b> only-begotten (monogenes) <b>son,</b> from me.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And she saw Mr. Van Brandt," [...] {{my mother}} went on. [...] "She gave me no {{detailed}} account of the interview between them. 'He reminded me,' she said, 'of what I knew to be true--that {{the woman who had}} entrapped him into marrying her was an incurable drunkard, and that his ever living with her again was out of the question. Still she was alive, and she had a right to the name at least of his wife. I won't attempt to excuse my returning to him, knowing the circumstances as I did. I will only say that I could see no other choice before me, in my position at the time. It is needless to trouble you with what I have suffered since, or to speak of what I may suffer still. I am a lost woman. Be under no alarm, madam, <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>son.</b> I shall remember proudly to the end of my life that he once offered me the honor and the happiness of becoming his wife; but I know what is due to him and to you. I have seen him for the last time. The one thing that remains to be done is to satisfy him that our marriage is impossible. You are a mother; you will understand why I reveal the obstacle which stands between us--not to him, but to you.' She rose saying those words, and opened the folding-doors which led from the parlor into a back room. After an absence of a few moments only, she returned." ...|$|E
6000|$|George’s {{vouchers}} {{and accounts}} had perished with himself; {{and it appeared}} he was in debt to the Commissioners. But my grandfather wrote to Orkney twice, collected evidence of his disbursements, and proved him to be seventy pounds ahead. With this sum, he applied to George’s brothers, and had it apportioned between their mother and themselves. He approached the Board and got an annuity of £5 bestowed on the widow Peebles; and we find him writing her a long letter of explanation and advice, and pressing on her the duty of making a will. That he should thus act executor was no singular instance. But besides this {{we are able to}} assist at some of the stages of a rather touching experiment; no less than an attempt to secure Charles Peebles heir to George’s favour. He is despatched, under the character of ‘a fine young man’; recommended to gentlemen for ‘advice, as he’s a stranger in your place, and indeed to this kind of charge, this being his first outset as Foreman’; and for a long while after, the letter-book, in the midst of that thrilling first year of the Bell Rock, is encumbered with pages of instruction and encouragement. The nature of a bill, and the precautions that are to be observed about discounting it, are expounded at length and with clearness. ‘You are not, I hope, neglecting, Charles, to work the harbour at spring-tides; and see that you pay the greatest attention to get the well so as to supply the keeper with water, for he is a very helpless fellow, and so unfond of hard work that I fear he could do ill to keep himself in water by going to the other side for it.’—‘With regard to spirits, Charles, I see very little occasion for it.’ These abrupt apostrophes sound to me like the voice of an awakened conscience; but they would seem to have reverberated in vain in the ears of Charles. There was trouble in Pladda, his scene of operations; his men ran away from him, there was at least a talk of calling in the Sheriff. ‘I fear,’ writes my grandfather, ‘you have been too indulgent, and I am sorry to add that men do not answer to be too well treated, a circumstance which I have experienced, and which you will learn as you go on in business.’ I wonder, was not Charles Peebles himself a case in point? Either death, at least, or disappointment and discharge, must have ended his service in the Northern Lights; and in later correspondence I look in vain for any mention of his name—Charles, I mean, not Peebles: for as late as 1839 my grandfather is patiently writing to another of the family: ‘I am sorry you took the trouble of applying to me <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> as it lies quite {{out of my way to}} forward his views in the line of his profession as a Draper.’ ...|$|E

50|$|Your son has excelled {{from the}} start to gain favor amongst the pupils in the {{institution}} through an excellent manner, through hard work and persistence, and through unremitting zeal. His efficient and robust temper is free from dry or affected coercion, and his musical talent and genuine love of art leads him away from wild freedom and disorder. You have given him a proper upbringing, which would have still have been insufficient without such natural traits. From no direction has there been spoken even the slightest complaint or criticism <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>son.</b> On the contrary, his progress has been so remarkable that, for example, on the violin, the concertmaster David recently remarked to me that your sone is already such a good and capable musician that, should he remain in good health, nothing could stop him in any place from gaining recognition for his own achievements and contributions to art for its own honor.|$|E
5000|$|Kasten, fourth {{child of}} Ferdinand Kasten {{and his wife}} Barbara Anna Kasten, grew up in San Francisco's Richmond District. He was a student of art {{from an early age}} and {{regularly}} competed with his older brother Fred in battleship drawing contests. Fred eventually gave up but Karl continued. At times, Kasten's art seemingly {{got in the way of}} his schoolwork and his sixth grade teacher was driven to send a note home: [...] "Dear Mr. Kasten, Do something <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>son.</b> All he wants to do is draw. He's not paying attention in school" [...] Fortunately, his father sent a note back to the teacher: [...] "Let him draw." [...] The same year, with financial help from his older brother Fred, Karl furthered his artistic advancement at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute) and his explorations of art continued from there. Following his graduation from San Francisco Polytechnic High School, Kasten pursued an education in fine art.|$|E
