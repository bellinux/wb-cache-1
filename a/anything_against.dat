5|$|The backstory {{presented}} in StarCrafts manual {{and in the}} novel Shadow Hunters also shows {{the rise of a}} second society of Protoss known as the Nerazim. They are a sizeable minority of the Protoss who reject the Khala out of fear of losing their individuality inside the psychic link. The Nerazim are treated as heretics by the Khalai Protoss and are forcibly evicted from Aiur. Despite their persecution, the majority of Dark Templar do not hold <b>anything</b> <b>against</b> their estranged brethren, seeking to defend Aiur in any way they can. The Nerazim are presented as nomadic, liberal society, only settling on the planet Shakuras to study a Xel'Naga temple there. During the Brood War event, the Protoss lose their homeworld of Aiur to the Zerg (even with the Overmind being destroyed by Tassadar) and the Khalai Protoss are forced to escape and seek refuge on Shakuras, by then the homeworld of the Nerazim Protoss. After the conclusion of StarCraft, the two groups begin to reconcile, but the reconciliation is marred by mutual distrust.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} way to Buddhism, Taoist schools sought {{throughout}} history to define what would be sexual misconduct. The precept against Sexual Misconduct is sex outside your marriage. The married spouses (夫婦) usually in Chinese suggest male with female, though the scripture itself does not explicitly say <b>anything</b> <b>against</b> same-gender relations. Many sorts of precepts mentioned in the Seven Slips of Cloudy Satchel (雲笈七籤), The Mini Daoist Canon, does not explicitly say <b>anything</b> <b>against</b> same-gender relations as well.|$|E
25|$|Emden's {{assertion}} of heresy was chiefly {{based on the}} interpretation of some amulets prepared by Eybeschutz, in which Emden professed to see Sabbatean allusions. Hostilities began before Eybeschutz left Prague; when Eybeschutz was named chief rabbi of the three communities of Altona, Hamburg, and Wandsbek (1751), the controversy reached the stage of intense and bitter antagonism. Emden maintained {{that he was at}} first prevented by threats from publishing <b>anything</b> <b>against</b> Eybeschutz. He solemnly declared in his synagogue the writer of the amulets to be a Sabbathean heretic and deserving of cherem (excommunication).|$|E

25|$|Many boxing {{analysts and}} experts said that Darren Barker has {{the skills and}} ring generalship to one day become a champion, but that his skills were not perfected enough to do <b>anything</b> <b>against</b> Martínez. The first few rounds showed that Barker was {{actually}} able to make Martínez uncomfortable in the ring and give him more trouble than expected. Throughout the fight, Barker consistently gave Martínez problems, while never hurting him or really ever winning any of the rounds, he gave Martínez a challenge by coming in but not giving much offence to let Martínez counter or land anything clean. He also managed to get Martínez's nose to bleed early in the rounds by an upper-cut. Martínez, however, fought through the difficulty and eventually found openings {{which led to a}} knock-out of Barker, in the 11th with a right hook.|$|E
25|$|At present, the Bumiputra {{privileges}} both {{enshrined in}} Article 153 and as set out by other acts of law, remain in force. Many opposition parties including, the DAP and Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR), have pledged themselves to undoing the NEP. The DAP {{has argued that}} it does not have <b>anything</b> <b>against</b> the special position of Bumiputras as set out in Article 153, but seeks to undo the government's policies such as the NEP that they believe discriminate unfairly against the non-Bumiputras. The PKR, which was founded to fight for the release of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who had been detained for charges of corruption and sodomy after he publicly opposed Mahathir's policies, also has criticised the NEP. After Anwar's release in 2004, he criticised the NEP as having failed the Malays and stated that he would seek its replacement by a more equitable policy.|$|E
25|$|The colonists were {{followed}} by state employees, by Slovak farmers (including those who inherited land or bought it in a standard legal way with their own money) and later by anybody denoted as an unreliable. Lists of unreliable persons were prepared {{by members of the}} Hungarian United Party already before the First Vienna Award. The measures took place in a violent way with shooting, casualties and looting of Slovak and Czech stores and property. Military bodies usually did not react to complaints, or they openly declared that they would not do <b>anything</b> <b>against</b> offenders and violence. Under such conditions, many Slovaks and Czechs decided to leave the territory. In addition, they signed official statement that they moved voluntarily and all of their property (except items allowed to be exported) passed into the ownership of Hungary. In Gbelce (Köbölkút), three Czech colonists were shot dead and one hanged. Employees of public administration had to leave territory in 48 hours and they were replaced by administration from Hungary.|$|E

25|$|Judge Dredd {{had survived}} however, {{and with the}} help of a handful of colleagues who had escaped being brainwashed such as Judge Giant, he led a revolt by the {{citizens}} against Cal's insane tyranny. But Cal had anticipated this and recruited an army of alien mercenaries, the Kleggs, a reptilian race of soldiers-for-hire. The revolt was quickly quashed with widespread loss of life. Dredd and the small number of survivors went into hiding and began a guerrilla campaign of resistance. However Cal decided to punish Mega City One by sentencing the entire population to death; he did this in alphabetical order beginning with the unfortunate Aaron A. Aardvark. Execution chambers were set up all over the city. Dredd managed to stop the executions by having Deputy Chief Judge Fish assassinated, which the superstitious Cal took to be an omen that the executions would lead to the death of the judges as well. However, when no citizens turned up for his pet's funeral he decided to punish the citizens by passing even more draconian laws. He appointed Grampus, the Klegg leader, as his new deputy and encouraged children to snoop on their parents if they said <b>anything</b> <b>against</b> his leadership. These and a wave of other measures made life intolerable for the beleaguered citizens.|$|E

500|$|After {{the episode}} aired, Parker and Stone {{received}} feedback that audiences felt [...] "Starvin' Marvin" [...] was especially unkind to Struthers. Although {{they did not}} speak to her themselves, the duo received word that Struthers was {{a fan of the}} show until [...] "Starvin' Marvin" [...] aired, after which she was very upset and reportedly reacted emotionally over her portrayal. Struthers was particularly saddened by the fact that her character steals food from the same starving children she had been working to help. Parker and Stone were slightly remorseful when they learned of her reaction and have said they did not have <b>anything</b> <b>against</b> Struthers personally. Nevertheless, Struthers was portrayed in an even less flattering way in the third season episode [...] "Starvin' Marvin in Space" [...] as a Jabba the Hutt-like creature. In a DVD commentary track, Parker said of Struthers, [...] "Dude, you're really setting yourself up if you're going to be that fat and go on the air talking about [...] ... We don't think she's a bad person, she's probably nice to try to do this, but cut down on the Twinkies a little bit before going on the air." ...|$|E
500|$|Titanic {{suffered}} backlash {{in addition}} to its success. In 2003, the film topped a poll of [...] "Best Film Endings", and yet it also topped a poll by Film 2003 as [...] "the worst movie of all time". The British film magazine Empire reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings. In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film. Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. [...] "What really irks me...," [...] he said, [...] "are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it." [...] Willcock stated, [...] "I obviously don't have <b>anything</b> <b>against</b> those who dislike Titanic, but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so (and they do exist, trust me) are way beyond my understanding and sympathy." ...|$|E
500|$|Michigan played {{its final}} home game on November 23 and won, 89–0, over Beloit College. The {{game was played}} in 30-minute halves at Regents Field in Ann Arbor. Michigan scored 15 touchdowns, six by Albert Herrnstein, three by Neil Snow, and single touchdowns by Shorts, Heston, White, Graver, Sweeley and Redner. Shorts also scored on 14 goals from touchdown, giving him 19 points. The game was played on a wet field that was [...] "practically a pond in the centre, filled in with sawdust before the game started." [...] Because of the field conditions, Michigan {{was not able to}} execute its end runs and relied principally on [...] "line bucking." [...] Right end Albert Herrnstein scored six touchdowns for 30 points, {{including}} two kickoff returns for touchdowns in the second half. Coach Yost later recalled the scene on the field after one of Herrnstein's runs: [...] "Once when Herrnstein made a long run for a touchdown I remember of seeing four Beloit players stretched on the ground in a line where they had made useless efforts to stop him." [...] Right tackle Bruce Shorts scored a touchdown and kicked 14 extra points for 19 points. Fullback Neil Snow added three touchdowns for 15 points, and single touchdowns were scored by Heston, White, Graver, Sweeley and Redden. The Beloit team managed to gain the five yards required for a first down on only one drive late in the game. Beloit's one first down came on a fake kick followed by a run of 15 yards—the largest gain made by any team against Michigan in 1901. The New York Times reported: [...] "The strong team from Beloit was unable to do <b>anything</b> <b>against</b> the Ann Arbor men." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1952, the Periyar Self-Respect Movement Institution was {{registered}} {{with a list}} of objectives of the institution from which may be quoted as for the diffusion of useful knowledge of political education; to allow people to live a life of freedom from slavery to <b>anything</b> <b>against</b> reason and self respect; to do away with needless customs, meaningless ceremonies, and blind superstitious beliefs in society; {{to put an end to}} the present social system in which caste, religion, community and traditional occupations based on the accident of birth, have chained the mass of the people and created [...] "superior" [...] and [...] "inferior" [...] classes... and to give people equal rights; to completely eradicate untouchability and to establish a united society based on /; to give equal rights to women; to prevent child marriages and marriages based on law favourable to one sect, to conduct and encourage love marriages, widow marriages, inter caste and inter-religious marriages and to have the marriages registered under the Civil Law; and to establish and maintain homes for orphans and widows and to run educational institutions. Propagation of the philosophy of self respect became the full-time activity of Periyar since 1925. A Tamil weekly Kudi Arasu started in 1925, while the English journal Revolt started in 1928 carried on the propaganda among the English educated people. The Self-Respect Movement began to grow fast and received the sympathy of the heads of the Justice Party from the beginning. In May 1929, a conference of Self-Respect Volunteers was held at Pattukkotai under the presidency of S. Guruswami. K.V. Alagiriswami took charge as the head of the volunteer band. Conferences followed in succession throughout the Tamil districts of the former Madras Presidency. A training school in Self-Respect was opened at Erode, the home town of Periyar. The object was not just to introduce social reform but to bring about a social revolution to foster a new spirit and build a new society.|$|E
