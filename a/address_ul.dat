40|$|Abstract. Energies and {{transition}} probabilities of Kβ hypersatellite lines are computed using the Dirac-Fock model for several values of Z throughout the periodic table. The {{influence of the}} Breit interaction on the energy shifts from the corresponding diagram lines and on the Kβh 1 /Kβh 3 intensity ratio is evaluated. The widths of the double-K hole levels are calculated for Al and Sc. The results are compared to experiment and to other theoretical calculations. PACS numbers: 31. 25. Jf, 32. 30 Rj, 32. 70.

5000|$|Some neighbourhoods may {{be planned}} {{in such a}} way that some, or most, {{apartment}} buildings face no named street. In this case, a number of expedients can be used. In older neighbourhoods, such as the historical center of Moscow, a [...] "main" [...] building may have the same number as one or more [...] "subsidiary" [...] buildings accessible via driveways behind the main building. They will be addressed as, for example, ul. Lenina, d. 123 (that is, 123 Lenin St). An address may also cover one or more subsidiary buildings behind the main building, <b>addressed</b> as <b>ul.</b> Lenina, d. 123, str. 2 (123 Lenin St, Unit 2, where str.

40|$|Infection with {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) results in the rapid {{elimination}} of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from host cells. It is known that a mitochondrial isoform of the viral alkaline nuclease (UL 12) called UL 12. 5 triggers this pro-cess. However, very {{little is known about}} the impact of mtDNA depletion on viral replication or the biology of HSV- 1 in-fections. These questions have been difficult to <b>address</b> because <b>UL</b> 12. 5 and UL 12 are encoded by overlapping transcripts that share the same open reading frame. As a result, mutations that alter UL 12. 5 also affect UL 12, and UL 12 null mutations severely impair viral growth by interfering with the intranuclear processing of progeny viral genomes. Therefore, to specif-ically assess the impact of mtDNA depletion on viral replication, it is necessary to eliminate the activity of UL 12. 5 while preserving the nuclear functions of UL 12. Previous work has shown that the human cytomegalovirus alkaline nuclease UL 98 can functionally substitute for UL 12 during HSV- 1 replication. We found that UL 98 is unable to deplete mtDNA in transfected cells and therefore generated an HSV- 1 variant in which UL 98 coding sequences replace the UL 12 /UL 12. 5 open reading frame. The resulting virus was severely impaired in its ability to trigger mtDNA loss but reached titers comparable to those of wild-type HSV- 1 in one-step and multistep growth experiments. Together, these observations demonstrate that the elimination of mtDNA is not required for HSV- 1 replication in cell culture. IMPORTANC...|$|R
40|$|The UL 11 and UL 16 {{tegument}} proteins of {{herpes simplex}} virus are conserved throughout the herpesvirus family. Previous {{studies have shown that}} these proteins interact, perhaps to link UL 16 -bound nucleocapsids to UL 11, which resides on the cytoplasmic face of the trans-Golgi network, where maturation budding occurs. Little is known about the interaction except that it requires the leucine-isoleucine (LI) and acidic cluster motifs in UL 11 and that no other viral proteins are involved. In particular, the important question of whether these two proteins bind to each other directly has not been <b>addressed.</b> Accordingly, <b>UL</b> 11 and UL 16 were expressed in bacteria, and the purified proteins were found to retain the ability to interact in a manner that was dependent upon the LI and acidic cluster. In an attempt to map the UL 11 -binding site contained in UL 16, a large number of deletion mutants were constructed. The first 40 (nonconserved) amino acids were found to be dispensable, but all the other constructs failed to bind UL 11 or had poor expression in transfected cells, suggesting that UL 16 is very sensitive to alterations and probably lacks a multidomain structure. As an alternative strategy for identifying residues that are important for the interaction, the cysteines of UL 16 were investigated, because many of these are highly conserved. Approximately half of the 20 cysteines in UL 16 {{have been shown to be}} covalently modified by N-ethylmaleimide, and this treatment was found to block the interaction with UL 11. Moreover, individual serine replacements of six of the most conserved cysteine residues were made, and four of these disrupted the interaction with UL 11 without affecting protein stability. However, the UL 11 -UL 16 interaction does not involve the formation of interspecies disulfide bonds, because binding occurred even when all the cysteines in UL 11 were eliminated. Thus, UL 16 directly interacts with UL 11 and does so in a manner that requires free cysteines...|$|R
