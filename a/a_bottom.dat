5000|$|Bottoming tap or plug tap: [...] The tap {{illustrated}} {{in the top of}} the image has a continuous cutting edge with almost no taper — between 1 and 1.5 threads of taper is typical. [...] This feature enables <b>a</b> <b>bottoming</b> tap to cut threads to the <b>bottom</b> of <b>a</b> blind hole. <b>A</b> <b>bottoming</b> tap is usually used to cut threads in a hole that has already been partially threaded using one of the more tapered types of tap; the tapered end ("tap chamfer") of <b>a</b> <b>bottoming</b> tap is too short to successfully start into an unthreaded hole. In the US, they are commonly known as bottoming taps, but in Australia and Britain they are also known as plug taps.|$|R

5|$|In a hierarchy, {{individuals}} are either dominant or submissive. A despotic hierarchy is where one individual is dominant {{while the others}} are submissive, as in wolves and lemurs, and a pecking order is a linear ranking of individuals {{where there is a}} top individual and <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> individual. Pecking orders may also be ranked by sex, where the lowest individual of a sex has a higher ranking than the top individual of the other sex, as in hyenas. Dominant individuals, or alphas, have a high chance of reproductive success, especially in harems where one or a few males (resident males) have exclusive breeding rights to females in a group. Non-resident males can also be accepted in harems, but some species, such as the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), may be more strict.|$|E

On 25 November he started against Aalborg but did not play well and missed several chances as Celtic lost 2–1. This loss consigned Celtic to <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> place finish in their group.|$|E

5|$|The Izak {{catshark}} is harmless and of no commercial value. It {{is regularly}} caught incidentally (and discarded) by <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> trawl fishery targeting hake south of Cape Town. In contrast to most cartilaginous fishes, its {{numbers have been}} increasing {{in the presence of}} commercial fishing. The reasons for this may include its high reproductive rate, its breeding in less-fished shallower waters, its hardiness allowing for high post-capture survival, and its opportunistic diet. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has consequently listed the Izak catshark under Least Concern, while still noting that it merits continued population monitoring because of its highly restricted range.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} in the pre-dawn hours as the young Nick Adams, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a doctor, has been called out to deliver a baby {{for a woman who}} has been in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a {{caesarian}} operation on the woman with a jack-knife because the baby is in the breech position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries to hold her down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor during the operation. Nick is sent out of the cabin, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his father on the lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father questions about birth and death, and thinks to himself that he will never die, as he watches his father row.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the thermodynamic performance of a novel small-scale power plant that employs a combined cycle for the energy generation from carbon-neutral biomass, such as pruning residues. The combined cycle is composed of an externally fired Joule Brayton cycle followed by <b>a</b> <b>bottoming</b> steam cycle. The topping cycle has the unique particularity of being composed of a cost-effective turbocharger taken from the automotive industry, in place of a more expensive commercial micro-turbine. The turbocharger can be either directly connected to the electric generator (after a few modifications) or coupled (without modifications) with a power turbine moving the generator. The use of solid biomass in the proposed plant is allowed by the presence of an external combustor and a gas-to-gas heat exchanger. The warm flue gases exhausted by the topping cycle are used in <b>a</b> <b>bottoming</b> cycle to produce steam, which can power a steam expander. This paper thermodynamically assesses the novel combined cycle in the configuration for the topping cycle that employs a turbocharger coupled with a power turbine capable of generating 30 kW of electrical power. Furthermore, the comparison between the performance obtained using the bottoming water Rankine cycle and <b>a</b> <b>bottoming</b> Organic Rankine Cycle is provided...|$|R
