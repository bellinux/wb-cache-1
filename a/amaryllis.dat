5|$|At {{the time}} both South African and South American plants {{were placed in}} this same genus. By {{the early nineteenth century}} <b>Amaryllis</b> had become a {{polymorphic}} (diverse) genus with about 50 species from what we would consider a dozen genera today, and attempts were made to separate it into different genera. This work commenced in 1819 with the contributions of the English botanist, the Revd. William Herbert in Curtis's Botanical Magazine which he expanded in 1821 in The Botanical Register, identifying 14 species of the new genus of Hippeastrum, and only leaving three species in <b>Amaryllis.</b> The rest of the <b>Amaryllis</b> species he transferred to other genera, several of which he created. Herbert further refined his descriptions of Hippeastrum in his work on the Amaryllidaceae in 1837.|$|E
5|$|The late 19th {{and early}} 20th century saw <b>Amaryllis</b> {{breeding}} {{develop in the}} United States, particularly in Texas, California, and Florida {{in conjunction with the}} USDA (1910–1939). The major US contribution came from the work of Henry Nehrling and Theodore Mead, whose hybrids crossed with Dutch stock have produced some modern hybrids, although not matching the European strains.|$|E
5|$|Foraging workers often visit Pisonia {{flowers and}} will {{feed on the}} nectar. Other flowers they will visit include Canavalia, Commicarpus, Ipomoea, Melanthera, Plumbago and Scaevola. Ochetellus flavipes {{regularly}} attends the mealybug Prorsococcus acanthodus and protects it by building shelters. They also attend a number of butterfly larvae, including Anthene lycaenoides (Pale Ciliate Blue), Ogyris <b>amaryllis</b> (Satin Azure), Ogyris olane (Olane Azure) and Ogyris oroetes (Silky Azure).|$|E
5|$|Of {{the commercially}} {{available}} Hippeastrum species, sometimes sold as 'exotic' <b>amaryllis,</b> Hippeastrum cybister has extremely thin petals {{often described as}} spider-like. The miniature evergreen Hippeastrum papilio or 'Butterfly Amaryllis' whose petals resemble a butterfly (papilio) has a unique color and pattern with broad rose-burgundy center stripes and striations of pale green on the upper petals and narrow stripes on the bottom three. It has been crossed with both cybister and single flower cultivars to produce hybrids with unusual striping.|$|E
5|$|A stylized {{flower of}} a Hippeastrum {{cultivar}} (under its common name of <b>amaryllis)</b> is used internationally {{as a symbol}} for organizations associated with Huntington's disease, a genetic degenerative disease of the nervous system. The widely used logo represents a double image of a head and shoulders as the flower of a growing and vibrant plant. The reduced size of the inner head and shoulders image symbolizes the diminution in a person caused by Huntington's disease. The leaves represent the protection, purpose, growth {{and development of the}} Huntington's community worldwide in its search for a cure and treatment.|$|E
5|$|It was de Jussieu in 1789 {{who first}} {{formally}} created a 'family' (Narcissi), as the seventh 'Ordo' (Order) {{of the third}} class (Stamina epigyna) of Monocots in which Narcissus and 15 other genera were placed. The {{use of the term}} Ordo at that time was closer to what we now understand as Family, rather than Order. The family has undergone much reorganisation since then, but in 1805 it was renamed after a different genus in the family, <b>Amaryllis,</b> as 'Amaryllideae' by Jaume St.-Hilaire and has retained that association since. Jaume St.-Hilaire divided the family into two unnamed sections and recognised five species of Narcissus, omitting N. serotinus.|$|E

25|$|With orchid {{crossing}} {{coming to}} an end, Mead devoted more and more attention of the breeding of <b>amaryllis</b> (hippeastrum), being greatly helped by Nehrling, who had a fine collection and allowed Mead to take what he wanted {{in the way of}} pollen for his experiments. Specimens with just a hair line color around each petal were intercrossed to produce nearly white varieties with a narrow border around each petal. His hybrid red and white striped ‘Mead-strain’ <b>amaryllis</b> also became the bulb of choice for many American southern gardens in the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
25|$|At Lake Charm Mead grew many palms {{from seed}} and hybridized orchids, bromeliads, crinum and later, caladium, <b>amaryllis</b> and daylilies. He {{established}} a strong friendship with Henry Nehrling of Gotha, Florida {{with whom he}} collaborated on many plant experiments.|$|E

25|$|From {{his first}} restaurant, Ramsay's empire has {{expanded}} rapidly, next opening Petrus, then <b>Amaryllis</b> in Glasgow (which {{he was later}} forced to close) and later Gordon Ramsay at Claridge's. He hired his friend and maître d'hôtel Jean-Philippe Susilovic, who works at Petrus and also appears on Ramsay's US TV show Hell's Kitchen. Restaurants at the Dubai Creek and Connaught hotels followed, the latter branded with his protégé Angela Hartnett's name. Ramsay has opened restaurants outside the UK, beginning with Verre in Dubai. Two restaurants, Gordon Ramsay at Conrad Tokyo and Cerise by Gordon Ramsay, both opened in Tokyo in 2005.

In it he travelled to Namibia to highlight the tensions between elephants and the local people, {{and what can be}} done so that both groups can live peacefully beside one another. He also took part in the Mongol Rally with News Corporation director Andrew Knight's daughter, <b>Amaryllis</b> Knight. Their challenge was to drive a car with under 1000cc from London to Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, for charity. Osbourne and his family reunited with a reality TV show on Fox that debuted 31 March 2009 but was cancelled after the first episode.|$|E
25|$|The type genus, Asparagus, {{from which}} {{the name of the}} order is derived, was {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, with ten species. He placed Asparagus within the Hexandria Monogynia (six stamens, one carpel) in his sexual classification in the Species Plantarum. The majority of taxa now considered to constitute Asparagales have historically been placed within the very large and diverse family, Liliaceae. The Liliaceae family was first described by Michel Adanson in 1763, and in his taxonomic scheme he created eight sections within it, including the Asparagi with Asparagus and three other genera. The system of organising genera into families is generally credited to Antoine Laurent de Jussieu who formally described both the Liliaceae and the type family of Asparagales, the Asparagaceae, as Lilia and Asparagi, respectively, in 1789. Jussieu established the hierarchical system of taxonomy (phylogeny), placing Asparagus and related genera within a division of Monocotyledons, a class (III) of Stamina Perigynia and 'order' Asparagi, divided into three subfamilies. The use of the term Ordo (order) at that time was closer to what we now understand as Family, rather than Order. In creating his scheme he used a modified form of Linnaeus' sexual classification but using the respective topography of stamens to carpels rather than just their numbers. While De Jussieu's Stamina Perigynia also included a number of 'orders' that would eventually form families within the Asparagales such as the Asphodeli (Xanthorrhoeaceae), Narcissi (Amaryllidaceae) and Irides (Iridaceae), the remainder are now allocated to other orders. Jussieu's Asparagi soon came to be referred to as Asparagacées in the French literature (Latin: Asparagaceae). Meanwhile, the 'Narcissi' had been renamed as the 'Amaryllidées' (Amaryllideae) in 1805, by Jean Henri Jaume Saint-Hilaire, using <b>Amaryllis</b> as the type species rather than Narcissus, and thus has the authority attribution for Amaryllidaceae. In 1810 Brown proposed that a subgroup of Liliaceae be distinguished {{on the basis of the}} position of the ovaries and be referred to as Amaryllideae and in 1813 de Candolle described Liliacées Juss. and Amaryllidées Brown as two quite separate families.|$|E
500|$|Since then a key {{question}} has been whether Linnaeus's original type was a South African plant (now <b>Amaryllis)</b> or a South American plant (now Hippeastrum). If the latter, the correct name for the genus Hippeastrum would then be <b>Amaryllis</b> and a new name {{would need to be}} found for the South African genus. In 1938 JCT Uphof claimed, with some evidence, that the plant was in fact the South American Hippeastrum equestre (Linn. fil.) Herb. (syn. <b>Amaryllis</b> equestris (Linn. fil.) ex Aiton, accepted name H. puniceum) a plant which Carl Linnaeus' son, Linnaeus the Younger (Linn. fil.) had described c. 1781-3 (unpublished) but soon after appearing in the Hortus Kewensis of 1789. [...] This paper sparked a debate over the next half century, that delayed the official transfer of species from <b>Amaryllis</b> to Hippeastrum. This debate involved botanists {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic and the final outcome was a decision by the 14th International Botanical Congress in 1987 that <b>Amaryllis</b> L. should be a nomen conservandum (conserved name, i.e. correct regardless of priority) and ultimately based on a specimen of the South African <b>Amaryllis</b> belladonna from the Clifford Herbarium. Thus <b>Amaryllis</b> L. is the correct name for the South African genus, not the South American genus (Hippeastrum).|$|E
500|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the genus}} is complicated. The first issue is whether the name should more properly be <b>Amaryllis</b> L.. In 1753 Carl Linnaeus created the name <b>Amaryllis</b> belladonna, [...] the type species of the genus <b>Amaryllis,</b> in his Species Plantarum along with eight other <b>Amaryllis</b> species. Linnaeus had earlier worked on the Estate of George Clifford near Haarlem between 1735 and 1737 describing the plants growing there in his Hortus Cliffortianus in 1738. It is to this work that he refers in his Species Plantarum. This {{was assumed to be}} the South African Cape Belladonna, although not precisely known. Clifford's herbarium is now preserved at the Natural History Museum in London.|$|E
500|$|Herbert's {{fourteen}} species included this Hippeastrum equestre. This 'equine' connection {{refers to}} Carl Linnaeus the Younger who had named (in an unpublished manuscript) a West Indian species as <b>Amaryllis</b> equestris, {{because of its}} similarity to the [...] African genus <b>Amaryllis.</b> This name and attribution was first published by William Aiton in 1789, in his Hortus Kewensis.

500|$|Hippeastrum is a genus in {{the family}} Amaryllidaceae (subfamily Amaryllidoideae, tribe Hippeastreae, and {{subtribe}} Hippeastrineae) The name Hippeastrum, given to it by William Herbert, means [...] "Knight's-star-lily", although precisely what Herbert meant by the name is not certain. For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names <b>Amaryllis</b> and Hippeastrum, one result {{of which is that}} the common name [...] "amaryllis" [...] is mainly used for cultivars of this genus, often sold as indoor flowering bulbs particularly at Christmas in the northern hemisphere. By contrast the generic name <b>Amaryllis</b> applies to bulbs from South Africa, usually grown outdoors.

500|$|As {{background}} {{research to}} the story, Fleming corresponded with Captain E.K. Le Mesurier, {{secretary of the}} National Rifle Association at Bisley for information and to correct {{some of the more}} specialist areas of knowledge required for sniper shooting. Part of the background to the plot, of using the noise of the orchestra to cover the crossing over no man's land, was inspired by Pat Reid's escape from Colditz prisoner of war camp, with two escapers having to run across a courtyard under the cover of the noise from an orchestra. The conductor of the Colditz orchestra was Douglas Bader, who played golf with Fleming on a number of occasions. The assassin, Trigger, was partly based on <b>Amaryllis</b> Fleming, Ian's half-sister, a concert cellist with blonde hair, and Fleming managed to get a passing reference to her in the story, saying: [...] "Of course Suggia had managed to look elegant, as did that girl <b>Amaryllis</b> somebody." ...|$|E

500|$|The name Hippeastrum {{was first}} {{given to the}} genus by Herbert, being derived from the Ancient Greek, meaning a [...] "Knight's Star" [...] from ἱππεύς (hippeus, mounted knight) and ἄστρον ( [...] , star), to {{describe}} the first recognized species, Hippeastrum reginae. Herbert proposed to call the genus, which he distinguished from Linnaeus' <b>Amaryllis,</b> Hippeastrum, or [...] "Knight's-star-lily". He states; [...] "I have named [...] Hippeastrum or Knights-star-lily, pursuing the idea which {{gave rise to the}} name Equestris" [...] (p.12).|$|E
500|$|De Candolle brought {{together}} Linnaeus' genera and Jussieau's families into a systematic taxonomy {{for the first}} time, but included Narcissus (together with <b>Amaryllis)</b> in the Liliaceae in his Flore française (1805-1815) rather than Amaryllidaceae, a family {{he had not yet}} recognised. Shortly thereafter he separated the 'Amaryllidées' from 'Liliacées' (1813), though attributing the term to Brown's 'Amaryllideae' in the latter's Prodromus (1810) rather than St.-Hilaire's 'Amaryllidées'. He also provided the text to the first four volumes of Redouté illustrations in the latter's [...] Les liliacées between 1805 and 1808 (see illustration here of N. candidissimus).|$|E
