50|$|The {{investment}} problem {{faced by}} traders when they allocate our money across individual stocks is complex. They need {{a method to}} split their wealth across the thousands of different stocks out there. Investors often make decisions {{at the level of}} <b>asset</b> <b>categories.</b> They can split stocks into categories of small-cap, mid-cap, large-cap, value, growth, technology stocks, utility stocks, and so on, and then allocate their money across these different categories. Investment categories are sometimes called “styles”.|$|E

25|$|The {{management}} of the banks’ asset portfolios also remains a challenge in today’s economic environment.

50|$|In practice, Banks’ <b>asset</b> <b>categories</b> include {{loans and}} leases, available-for-sale and {{held-to-maturity}} securities, and trading assets. Loans and leases, however, comprise {{the biggest and}} most important category for banks. These assets are classified as either “held-for-investment,” which is typically a small percent of the loans, or “held-for-sale”, accounted for at the lower of historical cost or fair value. The loans and leases in the held-for-sale classification are tested for impairment and, if impaired, written down to the present value of future cash flows. Loans are usually impaired because creditors will be unable to collect all amounts due.|$|E
5000|$|The company's {{flagship}} {{fund was}} established in 1982 by Terry Coxan and John Chandler and [...] "mimicked {{an early version of}} the permanent portfolio concept" [...] of Browne. According to Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazineit was designed to neutralize high inflation by investing in precious metals, Swiss bonds, U.S. Treasury bills and natural resource stocks. This was similar to Browne's strategy of 25% of a portfolio in bonds, stocks, cash and gold with annual re-balancing. Browne's strategy was portrayed as a [...] "fail-safe" [...] investment strategy and was outlined in his 1999 book Fail-Safe Investing. The Permanent Portfolio mutual fund, however, is more complex than Browne's original concept and has six <b>asset</b> <b>categories.</b> The fund aims to invest in a fixed percentage of uncorrelated, <b>asset</b> <b>categories</b> to minimize risk in changing economic climates. These include 35% in government bonds, 25% in gold and silver bullion, 15% in growth stocks, 10% in cash and Swiss francs and 15% in energy, mining, and real estate stocks. [...] The funds concept is to [...] "preserve capital and provide low risk growth" [...] through diversification. From 1982 through 2008, the fund's assets under management (AUM) were less than $50 million but they grew to $1 billion in 2007, $3.4 billion in 2008 and $5 billion in 2009. [...] As of 2012 the fund had $17 billion in assets under management with 20% invested in gold bullion [...] and a [...] "relatively high" [...] 0.71% annual management fee.|$|E

40|$|The {{results suggest}} that the {{composition}} of bank portfolios affect the market risk (beta) of bank stock returns. In particular, the 20 % <b>asset</b> <b>category,</b> which primarily includes government agency securities is associated with increases in market risk, indicating <b>assets</b> in this <b>category</b> are exposed to higher interest rate risk and prepayment risk. The market risk is lower for those institutions who concentrate on one-to-four family residential mortgages, suggesting home mortgages are well collateralized assets with low perceived credit risk. The off-balance sheet activities on average exhibit no significant impact on market risk. The results also suggest that the market perception of the insurer's expected liability is heavily influenced by Tier 1 capital ratio. ...|$|R

[...] However, a large minority of the assets were “held-for-sale” or trading assets. The loans and securities in the held-for-sale classification are tested for impairment and, if impaired, written down to the present value of future cash flows.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{knowledge}} dimensions grounding regional development dynamics. Design/methodology/approach – The paper first provides a knowledge-based interpretation of regional development and afterwards the knowledge <b>assets</b> <b>categories</b> at the basis of value creation dynamics at regional level are discussed. The aim is to define a conceptual framework addressing the knowledge <b>assets</b> <b>categories</b> affecting the development dynamics of regions and territories. To support these arguments, the paper integrates the conceptual framework with the analysis of a case study of an Italian region. The paper provides the case example of Basilicata region, which has planned and implemented policies aimed to activate and support regional strategic development by focusing on knowledge assets dimensions. The paper combines a deductive approach with an inductive one. The knowledge assets dimensions grounding regional development dynamics are identified through a review of the literature. Then, the conceptual framework is integrated by the analysis of a case study aimed to enrich the proposed conceptual arguments with empirical evidences. Findings – The paper highlights the strategic relevance of knowledge capital in sustaining and driving regional development dynamics. The knowledge assets dimensions grounding regional development are discussed, providing insights for both research and practice. Originality/value – This paper contributes to further develop the knowledge-based view of the regional development dynamics. The paper provides implications for future research and useful insights for policy making...|$|R
