5|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{demands of}} the Punic Wars, {{in addition to a}} shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, {{at least in the short}} term. In 217BC, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners when slaves were pressed into naval service; around 213BC, the property requirement was reduced from 11,000 to 4,000 <b>asses.</b> Since the Romans are unlikely to have preferred to employ slaves over poor citizens in their armies, it must be assumed that, at this point, the proletarii of the poorest citizens must also have been pressed into service despite their lack of legal qualification. By 123BC, the financial requirement for military service was slashed again from 4,000 <b>asses</b> to just 1,500 <b>asses.</b> By this time, therefore, it is clear that many of the property-less former proletarii had been nominally admitted into the adsidui.|$|E

40|$|Generally, {{aggregation}} of the amyloid-ß peptide {{is considered}} the cause of neuronal death in Alzheimer disease. The heterogenous <b>Aß</b> peptide occurs in various lengths in vivo: <b>Aß</b> 40 and <b>Aß</b> 42 are the predominant forms while both shorter and longer peptides exist. <b>Aß</b> 40 and shorter isoforms are less aggregation-prone and hence considered less dangerous than <b>Aß</b> 42 and longer isoforms, which are more aggregation-prone. Up to now research mainly focussed on the predominant <b>Aß</b> peptides and their individual characterization. This work emphasizes {{on the behavior of}} various isoforms in mixtures, as to mimick the in vivo situation. The results indicate that subtle differences in the ratio of <b>Aß</b> 40 to <b>Aß</b> 42 can induces strong differences in aggregation behavior and toxicity. This observation is not limited to these isoforms: {{a small fraction of the}} shorter <b>Aß</b> 38 or the longer <b>Aß</b> 43 affects the aggregation behavior of the predominant <b>Aß</b> isoforms. Additionally these minor peptides can enhance the toxic effects of <b>Aß</b> 40 on neurons while damping that of <b>Aß</b> 42. This is crucial for the development of new therapeutics as current strategies aim to decrease the production of <b>Aß</b> 42 while increasing <b>Aß</b> 38 levels at the same time. The strategy is based on the assumption that the presence of less aggregating <b>Aß</b> 38 is less hazardous than that of <b>Aß</b> 42. The results presented here however suggest that the situation is more nuanced. A detailed understanding of the agggregation behavior of less predominant <b>Aß</b> isoforms, in isolation but certainly in mixtures, will lead to better insight in the mechanisms leading to Alzheimer disease and as such contribute to improved therapeutic approaches...|$|R

5|$|Equines {{produce a}} number of vocalizations and noises. Loud {{snorting}} is associated with alarm. Squealing is usually made when in pain, but bachelors will also squeal while play fighting. The contact calls of equines vary from the whinnying and nickering of the horse, the barking of plains zebras, and the braying of <b>asses</b> and Grévy's zebras. Equines also communicate with visual displays and the flexibility of their lips allows them to make complex facial expressions. Visual displays also incorporate {{the positions of the}} head, ears and tail. An equine may signal an intention to kick by laying back its ears and sometimes lashing the tail. Flattened ears, bared teeth and abrupt movement of the heads may be used as threatening gestures, particularly among stallions.|$|E
5|$|Equus is a genus {{of mammals}} {{in the family}} Equidae, which {{includes}} horses, <b>asses,</b> and zebras.

Like Equidae more broadly, Equus has numerous extinct species known only from fossils. The genus most likely originated in North America and spread quickly to the Old World. Equines are odd-toed ungulates with slender legs, long heads, relatively long necks, manes (erect in most subspecies) and long tails. All species are herbivorous, and mostly grazers with simpler digestive systems than ruminants but able to subsist on lower quality vegetation.|$|E

40|$|Amyloid ß-peptide (<b>Aß),</b> <b>Aß</b> {{precursor}} protein (APP), apolipoprotein E (apoE), and elevated cholesterol levels {{have been linked}} to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. High cholesterol levels increase APP and apoE expression in human NT 2 neuron progenitor cells. A cholesterolrich environment also induces processing of APP, leading to the formation of <b>Aß</b> and <b>Aß</b> peptide fragments. Using a novel method, we determined that 1) cholesterol binds to <b>Aß</b> at α-secretase cleavage site; 2) <b>Aß</b> 17 – 40 rather than <b>Aß</b> 1 – 40 prevents cholesterol from binding to apoE; 3) <b>Aß</b> 1 – 40 inhibits cholesterol from binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), leading to decrease cholesterol influx and intracellular cholesterol levels; 4) the binding of cholesterol to apoE or LDL was abolished completely in presence of <b>Aß</b> 1 – 42. Increased extracellular free cholesterol levels are toxic to neurons; this toxicity is prevented by specific lipoproteins, such as highdensity lipoproteins, which maintain their ability to bind cholesterol in the presence of <b>Aß.</b> We propose that one of the physiological functions of <b>Aß</b> and APP is to control cholesterol transport. AD is associated with increased <b>Aß</b> production. High cholesterol levels also lead to overproduction of <b>Aß.</b> <b>Aß</b> blocks cholesterol trafficking and changes cholesterol homeostasis leading to neurodegeneration and the onset and/or progression of AD pathology.

40|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disease, mostly affectingelderly. The invariable deposition of protease-resistant fibrils of Alzheimer amyloidß-peptide (<b>Aß)</b> in the parenchyma and blood vessels of the brain is a centralevent. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether <b>Aß</b> develops proteaseresistance upon polymerization and whether <b>Aß</b> may be generated through non specificproteolysis of a polymerized precursor, to identify Aß-Aß binding and fibrilforming sequences in <b>Aß</b> and define the molecular basis of <b>Aß</b> polymerization,and to find inhibitors of fibril formation. To investigate if <b>Aß</b> fibril formation is sufficient to acquire protease resistance,non-polymerized and polymerized <b>Aß</b> were treated with an array of proteases. Non-polymerized <b>Aß</b> was degraded whereas fibrils were resistant to proteolysis. The proteases generating <b>Aß</b> from its precursor, APP, have not been identified. We show that <b>Aß</b> can be generated through nonspecific proteolysis of a polymerizedprecursor. A C-terminal fragment of APP was purified and allowed to polymerize. Fibrilsremained after digestion with proteinase K, an enzyme capable of cleaving most peptidebonds. The fibrils were dissolved and subjected to gel electrophoresis, showing anAß immunoreactive band comigrating with synthetic <b>Aß.</b> A sequence critical for Aß-Aß binding was identified by incubating decapeptidescorresponding to various <b>Aß</b> sequences with labeled <b>Aß</b> By systematicallytruncating binding peptides, the shortest sequence mediating intact <b>Aß</b> bindingwas found to be <b>Aß</b> 16 - 2 o Short peptides containing this sequence inhibited fibrilformation. Further studies showed that <b>Aß</b> 16 - 2 o bound to the homologous regionin <b>Aß.</b> The <b>Aß</b> 16 - 2 O sequence was used as a labeled probe to search for bindersin a combinatorial library consisting of pentapeptides composed of D-amino acids. The most efficient binders were incubated with <b>Aß</b> and found capable of inhibitingfibril formation. Hence, short <b>Aß</b> 16 - 2 o containing peptides can be used to identifyinhibitors of <b>Aß</b> fibril formation in combinatorial libraries. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was used to follow the polymerizationof <b>Aß</b> in solution. Initially, only monomers/dimers were observed and polymerizationwas found to proceed over large aggregates, via small aggregates into mature fibrils. The amounts of aggregates were reduced in the presence of an inhibitor and formedaggregates were partly dissolved after addition of an inhibitor. Labeled inhibitorbound to monomeric/dimeric <b>Aß</b> as well as aggregates and was displaced by unlabeledinhibitor. The shortest fibril forming sequence containing the Aß-Aß binding motifwas identified by systematically elongating and truncating sequences containing <b>Aß</b> 16 - 2 o. The shortest sequence forming Aß-like fibrils was <b>Aß</b> 14 - 23. Substitutionsand truncations in this peptide yielded ultrastructurally different aggregates, noneresembling <b>Aß</b> fibrils. A model with favorable hydrophobic and ionic interactionsbetween two <b>Aß</b> 14 - 23 peptides in an antiparalell ß-sheet configurationwere subjected to molecular modeling. Two dimers were aligned to form a tetramer,which could be the smallest repeating unit in fibrils. It is suggested that theseinteractions are present also in <b>Aß</b> fibrils.

5|$|Equines are {{monogastric}} hindgut fermenters. They {{prefer to}} eat grasses and sedges, {{but may also}} consume bark, leaves, buds, fruits and roots if their favored foods are scarce, particularly <b>asses.</b> Compared to ruminants, equines have a simpler and less efficient digestive system. Nevertheless, they can subsist on lower quality vegetation. After food is passed though the stomach, it enters the sac-like cecum. where cellulose is broken down by micro-organisms. Fermentation is quicker in equines than in ruminants; 30–45 hours for a horse compared to 70–100 hours for a cow. Equines may spend 60-80 {{percent of their time}} feeding, depending on the availability and quality of vegetation. In the African savannas, the plains zebra is a pioneer grazer; mowing down the upper, less nutritious grass canopy and preparing the way for more specialized grazers like blue wildebeests and Thomson's gazelles which depend on shorter and more nutritious grasses below.|$|E
5|$|The Protestant Reformation {{inspired}} a literal {{interpretation of the}} Bible, with concepts of creation that conflicted {{with the findings of}} an emerging science seeking explanations congruent with the mechanical philosophy of René Descartes and the empiricism of the Baconian method. After the turmoil of the English Civil War, the Royal Society wanted to show that science did not threaten religious and political stability. John Ray developed an influential natural theology of rational order; in his taxonomy, species were static and fixed, their adaptation and complexity designed by God, and varieties showed minor differences caused by local conditions. In God's benevolent design, carnivores caused mercifully swift death, but the suffering caused by parasitism was a puzzling problem. The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 also viewed species as fixed according to the divine plan. In 1766, Georges Buffon suggested that some similar species, such as horses and <b>asses,</b> or lions, tigers, and leopards, might be varieties descended from a common ancestor. The Ussher chronology of the 1650s had calculated creation at 4004BC, but by the 1780s geologists assumed a much older world. Wernerians thought strata were deposits from shrinking seas, but James Hutton proposed a self-maintaining infinite cycle, anticipating uniformitarianism.|$|E

40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is {{characterized}} by the intracellular deposition of ubiquitinated tau and by the extracellular accumulation of soluble, insoluble, and fibrillary <b>Aß.</b> Previous studies suggest that <b>Aß</b> is normally eliminated from the brain along perivascular pathways that may become blocked in the aging brain, resulting in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. As age is a major risk factor for AD and for cerebrovascular disease (CVD), we test the hypothesis that CVD inhibits the elimination of <b>Aß</b> from the aging human brain. Sections from 100 aged and AD brains were stained for <b>Aß</b> by immunohistochemistry and by reticulin and Masson trichrome techniques. Early deposition of <b>Aß</b> in brain parenchyma was related to individual arterial territories in the cortex. In areas of more extensive accumulation of <b>Aß,</b> there was an inverse relationship between capillary amyloid angiopathy and plaques of <b>Aß.</b> Thus, arterial territories with extensive capillary amyloid angiopathy were devoid of <b>Aß</b> plaques, whereas in areas with abundant diffuse plaques there was no capillary amyloid angiopathy. Serial sections showed that cortical arteries feeding capillary beds with <b>Aß</b> angiopathy were occluded by thrombus. We conclude that CVD inhibits the elimination of <b>Aß</b> along capillary walls and changes the distribution of <b>Aß</b> in the cerebral cortex. Loss of pulsations in thrombosed or arteriosclerotic arteries may thus abolish the motive force necessary for the drainage of <b>Aß</b> and inhibit the elimination of <b>Aß.</b> Therapies to increase elimination of <b>Aß</b> in AD need to consider the effects of CVD on the elimination of <b>Aß</b> from the aging human brain...|$|R
