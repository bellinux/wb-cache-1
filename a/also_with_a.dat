5|$|At the World Championship, O'Sullivan {{began his}} title defence by beating Robin Hull 10–4 {{in the first}} round. Playing Joe Perry in the second round, O'Sullivan was behind {{for the first two}} sessions, but {{recovered}} to win the match 13–11. Up against Shaun Murphy in the 16th World Championship quarter-final of his career, O'Sullivan took 13 of the last 14 frames to win the match 13–3, with a session to spare. He defeated Barry Hawkins 17–7 in the semi-finals, <b>also</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> session to spare, to reach his sixth World Championship final. Facing Mark Selby in the final, O'Sullivan began strongly, taking a 10–5 lead, but lost 10 of the next 12 frames to trail 12–15. He went on to lose 14–18, his first ever defeat in a World Championship final. At around 1:30a.m., on their way home from the final, O'Sullivan and his six-year-old son were involved in a car crash. Neither O'Sullivan nor his son were injured. After the World Championship, a new ranking system took effect, based on a two-year rolling prize money list rather than ranking points. This meant that O'Sullivan ended the season ranked number 4.|$|E
5|$|Atlético did {{not take}} part in any {{continental}} competitions in 1999, but as Série A runner-up in that year the club qualified for the 2000 Copa Libertadores and the 2000 Copa Mercosur. The latter was a new continental competition introduced in 1998, which eventually replaced both the Copa CONMEBOL and the Supercopa Libertadores for clubs in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. In its return to the Copa Libertadores after nineteen years, Atlético was drawn in Group 8, with Bolivian Club Bolívar, Uruguayan side Bella Vista, and Chile's Cobreloa. Atlético's form in the group stage was erratic, but enough to ensure qualification for the next stage in second place. The team won its three home matches, which included a joint-record 60 victory against Cobreloa, and lost the three away ones, <b>also</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> joint-record, a 40 defeat against Bolívar. In the round of 16, the team faced Brazilian side Atlético Paranaense, which it eliminated by a score of 53 in a penalty shootout, after winning 10 at home and losing 21 away. The team's opponent in the quarter-finals was Corinthians, winner of the previous year's Série A finals over Atlético. After drawing 11 at the Mineirão, Atlético was defeated 21 in São Paulo and eliminated.|$|E

He quickly {{distinguished}} himself in his work for the zoo, first with his skill in designing habitats for its bird population, and soon <b>also</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> series of research expeditions of increasing length, including an expedition around the world to document the world's pheasants. These expeditions formed the basis for a large quantity of writing for both popular and academic audiences, including an account of his pheasant expedition titled A Monograph of the Pheasants and published in four volumes from 1918 to 1922. In recognition of the research conducted on his expeditions, he was granted honorary doctorates from Tufts and Colgate University.|$|E

5|$|Robson {{defeated}} bowel {{cancer in}} 1992, a malignant melanoma in 1995, and a tumour {{in his right}} lung and a brain tumour, both in 2006. Treatment of these conditions had left him partially paralysed due to a stroke caused by the brain tumour, and <b>also</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> partially prosthetic upper jaw after the melanoma was surgically removed. His fifth diagnosis of cancer in 2007, consisting of cancerous nodules in both lungs, was diagnosed as terminal in February 2007, and as of December 2008, was being controlled through bouts of chemotherapy. After these experiences, and following his fifth diagnosis with cancer, Robson devoted the remaining {{years of his life}} to helping fight the disease. On 25 March 2008, he launched the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. By November 2008, the Foundation had raised £1million. The money raised by the Foundation funded equipment for the Sir Bobby Robson Cancer Trials Research Centre, in the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne, and would go on to fund other cancer projects in the North East of England.|$|E
