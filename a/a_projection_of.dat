5|$|The final lasted {{six hours}} and was played {{in front of}} a crowd of nearly 20,000 fans at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. <b>A</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> the minimap which showed each team's map control was shown {{on the floor of the}} arena between the two teams. Most of the players for Samsung Galaxy (SSG) had never played in the finals before, while most members of SK Telecom (SKT) were {{returning}} members of the 2015 championship team. It was the first finals series in a League of Legends world championship to go the full five games.|$|E
5|$|Through his confession, Cobb makes {{peace with}} his guilt over Mal's death. Ariadne kills Mal's {{projection}} and wakes Fischer {{up with a}} kick. Revived at the mountain hospital, Fischer enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: <b>a</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> his dying father telling him to be his own man. While Cobb remains in Limbo to search for Saito, the other team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awake {{on the plane and}} Saito makes a phone call.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011, the NY Waterway-operated East River Ferry line started operations. The {{route is}} a 7-stop East River service that {{runs in a}} loop between East 34th Street and Hunters Point, making two {{intermediate}} stops in Brooklyn and three in Queens. The ferry, {{an alternative to the}} New York City Subway, cost $4 per one-way ticket. It was instantly popular, with two to six times the number of passengers that the city predicted would ride the ferries. From June to November 2011, the ferry accommodated 2,862 riders on an average weekday, as opposed to <b>a</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> 1,488 riders, and it had 4,500 riders on an average weekend, six times the city's projected ridership; in total, the ferry saw 350,000 riders in that period, over 250% of the initial ridership forecast of 134,000 riders.|$|E

25|$|Climate {{sensitivity}} {{is defined}} as the amount of global average surface warming following a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations. It is likely to be in the range of 2 to 4.5°C, with a best estimate of about 3°C.

25|$|In Ecofeminism (1993) authors Vandana Shiva, Maria Mies and Evan Bondi ponder {{modern science}} and its {{acceptance}} {{as a universal}} and value-free system.

The privilege of determining what is considered scientific knowledge has been controlled by men, {{and for the most}} part of history restricted to men. Bondi and Miles list examples including the medicalization of childbirth and the industrialization of plant reproduction.|$|E

25|$|Other {{research}} findings report <b>a</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> opposite trend. Although {{the demand for}} nurses continues to increase, the rate of employment has slowed down since 1994 because hospitals were incorporating more less-skilled nursing personnel to substitute for nurses. With the decrease in employment, the earnings for nurses decreased. Wage among nurses leveled off in correlation with inflation between 1990 and 1994. The recent economic crisis of 2009 has further decreased the demand for RNs.|$|E

25|$|The castle was {{originally}} {{built in the}} 11th century as <b>a</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> the Norman power in Northern England, as the population of England in the north remained rebellious following the disruption of the Norman Conquest in 1066.

The holder of the office of Bishop of Durham was appointed by the King to exercise royal authority on his behalf and the castle was the centre of his command.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{through the}} {{collective}} {{efforts of the}} U.P. Alumni Association and various private donors, the U.P. Carillon Restoration Project of the U.P.

25|$|In 2010, {{the early}} rate of home runs were {{markedly}} less through May 15, 2010, with 35 home runs hit in 14 games for 2.5 per game (<b>a</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> 205—in 2009, the stadium finished at 2.93 per {{game for a}} total of 237). Even though the stadium's home run rate decreased slightly for the 2010 season to 2.73 per game, it was still the highest figure in the majors. However, the prolific home run rate of April and May 2009 that drew criticism has not sustained itself over any season thus far, and while through the first two months of the 2011 season the Yankees hit far more homers than any other team in the majors, Yankee Stadium was not the top home run park.|$|E

25|$|The helical wheel {{represents}} a helix by <b>a</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> the Cα backbone structure down the helix axis, while the wenxiang diagram represents it more abstractly as a smooth spiral coiled {{on the plane}} of the page. Both label the sequence with one-letter amino-acid code (see amino acid) at each Cα position, using different colors or symbols to code the amino-acid properties. Hydrophobic vs hydrophilic amino acids are always distinguished, as the most important property governing helix interactions. Sometimes positively vs negatively charged hydrophilics are distinguished, and sometimes ambiguous amino acids such as glycine (G) are distinguished. Color-coding conventions are various. The helical wheel does not change representation along the helix, while the wenxiang diagram is able to show the relative locations of the amino acids in an α-helix regardless of how long it is.|$|E
25|$|Various {{theories}} {{have been put}} forward to explain the occurrence of hallucinations. When psychodynamic (Freudian) theories were popular in psychology, hallucinations were seen as <b>a</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> unconscious wishes, thoughts, and wants. As biological {{theories have}} become orthodox, hallucinations are more often thought of (by psychologists at least) as being caused by functional deficits in the brain. With reference to mental illness, the function (or dysfunction) of the neurotransmitters glutamate and dopamine {{are thought to be}} particularly important. The Freudian interpretation may have an aspect of truth, as the biological hypothesis explains the physical interactions in the brain, while the Freudian interpretation addresses the psychological complexes related to the content of the hallucination, such as hallucinating persecutory voices due to guilt. Psychological research has argued that hallucinations may result from biases in what are known as metacognitive abilities.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} reasons for this discrepancy. First, some news sources include only pledged delegates in their total count, while others include superdelegates. Second, {{estimates}} of superdelegate votes are unreliable and are subject to change. Third, pledged delegates in many states are selected at county or state conventions late in the process; thus, the initial primary and caucus results provide only <b>a</b> <b>projection</b> <b>of</b> pledged delegates, highlighted by the discrepancies with the Iowa county convention results. Fourth, {{in the days after}} an election, results in individual precincts may be delayed, and news organizations may project the winners of those precincts based on statistical analysis or may wait for confirmed results. The Democratic nominating process is a complex system that has evolved over time, and in close races, it can be difficult under the current system to know who is leading in the delegate count.|$|E
