25|$|Albury's {{proximity}} to Wodonga has spurred several efforts to achieve {{some kind of}} municipal governmental union (see Albury-Wodonga). In 1973, Albury-Wodonga {{was selected as the}} primary focus of the Whitlam federal government's scheme to redirect the uncontrolled growth of Australia's large coastal cities (Sydney and Melbourne in particular) by encouraging decentralisation. Grand plans were made to turn Albury-Wodonga into a major inland city and large areas of the surrounding farmland was compulsorily purchased by the government. Some industries were enticed to move there, and a certain <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>population</b> movement resulted. However, the current urban population is approximately 88,949.|$|E
2500|$|Bicycle {{infrastructure}} in Copenhagen currently includes approximately [...] of curb segregated cycle tracks, [...] of on-street cycle lanes and [...] of off-street green bicycle routes running through parks and other green areas. In relation, Bremen {{with a very}} similar <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>population</b> has [...] of curb segregated cycle tracks, but only a bit above 26% cycle traffic. According to the cycle track priority plan, the city plans to expand this by [...] of cycle tracks and [...] of green bicycle routes by 2026 before it deems the network complete. The city allocated some DKK 75 million (approx. US$13M) to new or improved bike specific infrastructure and DKK 17 million (approx. US$2.3M) on operation and maintenance of the network in the 2013 budget.|$|E
60|$|The article {{does not}} give the number {{of members of the}} Lower House, nor does it even state what <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>population</b> shall be held as {{entitled}} to a member. It merely provides for the division of the State into districts which shall contain an equal number, not of population, but of voters. The House of Assembly does consist of 128 members.|$|E
50|$|Genetic {{variation}} in populations can greatly influence, and be influenced by, surrounding ecological processes. Plants that show greater genetic diversity attract a greater <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> insect <b>populations</b> to feed because {{they offer a}} wider variety of choices to eat from and live in. Since the Red Alder does not have high genetic diversity; the ecosystem around it will hardly be affected and contain a lower <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>populations.</b>|$|R

60|$|In {{the course}} of the present session of Congress a bill was {{introduced}} for apportioning representatives among the people of the several States, according to the first enumeration. The constitution had provided that the number of representatives should not exceed one for every thirty thousand persons, and the House of Representatives passed a bill allotting to each State one member for this <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>population.</b> This ratio would leave a fraction, greater or less, in each State. Its operation was unequal, as in some States a large surplus would be unrepresented, and hence, in one branch of the legislature, the relative power of the State be affected. That, too, was the popular branch, which those who feared a strong executive, desired to provide with the counterpoise of as full a representation as possible.|$|E
60|$|In {{the eastern}} part of Java, at Kediri and in Malang, there are equally {{abundant}} traces of antiquity, but the buildings themselves have been mostly destroyed. Sculptured figures, however, abound; and the ruins of forts, palaces, baths, aqueducts, and temples, can be everywhere traced. It is altogether contrary to the plan of this book to describe what I have not myself seen; but, having been led to mention them, I felt bound to do something to call attention to these marvellous works of art. One is overwhelmed by the contemplation of these innumerable sculptures, worked with delicacy and artistic feeling in a hard, intractable, trachytic rock, and all found in one tropical island. What could have been the state of society, what the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>population,</b> what the means of subsistence which rendered such gigantic works possible, will, perhaps, ever remain a mystery; and it is a wonderful example of the power of religious ideas in social life, that in the very country where, five hundred years ago, these grand works were being yearly executed, the inhabitants now only build rude houses of bamboo and thatch, and look upon these relics of their forefathers with ignorant amazement, as the undoubted productions of giants or of demons. It is much to be regretted that the Dutch Government does not take vigorous steps for the preservation of these ruins from the destroying agency of tropical vegetation; and for the collection of the fine sculptures which are everywhere scattered over the land.|$|E
60|$|The very {{extent of}} the country he was called upon to govern, ten times larger than that of any {{previous}} republic, must have pressed with weight upon Washington's mind. It presented to the Atlantic a front of fifteen hundred miles, divided into individual States, differing in the forms of their local governments, differing {{from each other in}} interests, in territorial magnitudes, in <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>population,</b> in manners, soils, climates and productions, and the characteristics of their several peoples. Beyond the Alleghanies extended regions almost boundless, as yet for the most part wild and uncultivated. Vast tracts, however, were rapidly being peopled, and would soon be portioned into sections requiring local governments. The great natural outlet for the exportation of the products of this region of inexhaustible fertility, was the Mississippi; but Spain opposed a barrier to the free navigation of this river. Here was peculiar cause of solicitude. Before leaving Mount Vernon, Washington had heard that the hardy yeomanry of the far West were becoming impatient of this barrier, and indignant at the apparent indifference of Congress to their prayers for its removal. He had heard, moreover, that British emissaries were fostering these discontents, sowing the seed of disaffection, and offering assistance to the Western people to seize on the city of New Orleans and fortify the mouth of the Mississippi; while, on the other hand, the Spanish authorities at New Orleans were represented as intriguing to effect a separation of the Western territory from the Union, with a view or hope of attaching it to the dominion of Spain.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, whereas {{these four}} malls {{were located in}} and around more {{affluent}} suburbs, Eastland was located primarily around old mill towns. Many of these communities lost vast <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>population</b> during the lifetime of the Eastland Mall. Braddock, which East Pittsburgh-McKeesport Blvd leads directly into two miles (3 km) away, had approximately 12,000 residents in 1963. By the mall's close in 2005 it had fewer than 3,000. This demographic change took with it potential customers and employees of Eastland Mall.|$|R
60|$|Granpere {{in itself}} is a very {{pleasing}} village. Though the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>population</b> and number of houses do not suffice {{to make it more}} than a village, it covers so large a space of ground as almost to give it a claim to town honours. It is perhaps a full mile in length; and though it has but one street, there are buildings standing here and there, back from the line, which make it seem to stretch beyond the narrow confines of a single thoroughfare. In most French villages some of the houses are high and spacious, but here they seem almost all to be so. And many of them have been constructed after that independent fashion which always gives to a house in a street a character and importance of its own. They do not stand in a simple line, each supported by the strength of its neighbour, but occupy their own ground, facing this way or that as each may please, presenting here a corner to the main street, and there an end. There are little gardens, and big stables, and commodious barns; and periodical paint with annual whitewash is not wanting. The unstinted slates shine copiously under the sun, and over almost every other door there is a large lettered board which indicates that the resident within is a dealer in the linen which is produced throughout the country. All these things together give to Granpere an air of prosperity and comfort which is not at all checked by {{the fact that there is}} in the place no mansion which we Englishmen would call the gentleman's house, nothing approaching to the ascendancy of a parish squire, no baron's castle, no manorial hall,--not even a chateau to overshadow the modest roofs of the dealers in the linen of the Vosges.|$|E

In exchange for this alliance and via the First and Second Vienna Awards, Hungary received back parts of its lost territories from Yugoslavia, Romania, and Czechoslovakia.
