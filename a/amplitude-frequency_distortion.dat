The nature of the head-to-tape spacing transfer function allows {{the development of a}} closed form solution for FM distortion. Three methods of processing the voltage off the playback head are considered. Integrating the voltage results in <b>amplitude-frequency</b> <b>distortion,</b> but no harmonic distortion. Taking the voltage either directly off the head or differentiating it give both <b>amplitude-frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> and harmonic distortion. Experiments have verified the theoretical results...|$|E
