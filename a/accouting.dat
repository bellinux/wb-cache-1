40|$|In September 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board {{issued its}} Exposure Draft, Proposed Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, Business Combinations and Intangible Assets whitch would radically change the {{accounting}} for business combinations, goodwill and intagible assets. The Proposed Statement {{would eliminate the}} use of the pooling-of-interests methods to account for business combinations and require the purchase method to be used to account for all business combinations. In another major change to current practice, the statement would require that goodwill be recognized as asset, and be amrtized over its useful economic life; however, the maximum amortization period would be reduced from the current 40 years to 20 years. In addition, one of objectives in the Statement is to have more intangible assets separately recognized than are currently recognized in practice. That is, the Statement requires that all reliably measurable identifiable intangible assets would be recorded separately from goodwill in the financial statement at fair value.

40|$|Starting {{with the}} {{assumption}} that perception is not merely a reaction to outside stimulation but a process of creation, although mostly brief and inaccessible to conscious retrieval, the present paper attempts to determine the prerequisites of a stable and secure <b>accout</b> of reality. The authors’ leading hypothesis is that a dependable end product of adaptive and constructive processes is contingent on open communication with its subjective/emotional origins. A number of experiments offer empirical support for such an assumption. These experiments also address problems associated with creative functioning, anxiety, and defensive strategies. The general conclusion of this survey is that how we conceive of the outside world is determined, not only by the terminal stages of adaptive and constructive processes but by the entire course of these events, including its subjective/emotional origins...|$|R

In the most of the advanced countries, "Oyako-shinjyu" must be taken simply as a combination of the suicide and the very vicious crime of the murder of children.

Primarily using introductory sections of accounts about cases in a spread of therapeutic traditions, the paper analyses how ordinary commonplace <b>accouts</b> of embodiment may offer initial clues as to the 'state' of the client, present a picture of the problem, or be used as relevant biographical data. A key feature of the analysis is to show that these embodied accounts, using ordinary lay language, do important work in establishing problems as 'in and part of the world', but are also an appropriate supplement to thereapeutic accounts...|$|R
