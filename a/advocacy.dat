5|$|Boyer {{observes the}} {{distinction}} between how nonhuman animals can receive political protection {{as individuals and as}} species. He argues that the latter form of protection is motivated by a desire to preserve human experience of the species rather than the experiences of the nonhuman animals themselves. Politically motivated species <b>advocacy,</b> Boyer argues, is highly anthropocentric, as advocates present these animals as sharing in particular revered virtues; as a result, the likes of habitat and genetic health are the focus of advocates, rather than the nonhuman animals themselves. Using the example of polar bear preservation, Boyer illustrates how species <b>advocacy</b> becomes tied up with broader political goals concerning humans and competing visions of the value of animals. He concludes that the advancement of species <b>advocacy</b> can limit the achievement of animal welfare/rights goals.|$|E
