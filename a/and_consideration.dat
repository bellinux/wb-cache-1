5|$|A {{significant}} {{step in the}} process of acceptance back into the Olympic Movement was achieved at a ceremony held in Cardiff in November 1994, when the IRB was officially confirmed as a Recognised International Federation of the IOC. At that ceremony, International Olympic Committee President, Juan Antonio Samaranch, pointed out that rugby's history and values were very much in tune with the Olympic philosophy and traditions. This historic meeting in Cardiff led to IRB representation at annual IOC meetings <b>and</b> <b>consideration</b> for inclusion in the programme of future Olympic Games. In 2002, a plan was presented to induct rugby sevens, golf and the Chinese martial art of wushu.|$|E
5|$|After {{visiting his}} ancestral home in Suzhou, Pei created a design {{based on some}} simple but nuanced {{techniques}} he admired in traditional residential Chinese buildings. Among these were abundant gardens, integration with nature, <b>and</b> <b>consideration</b> {{of the relationship between}} enclosure and opening. Pei's design included a large central atrium covered by glass panels that functioned much like the large central space in his East Building of the National Gallery. Openings of various shapes in walls invited guests to view the natural scenery beyond. Younger Chinese who had hoped the building would exhibit some of Cubist flavor for which Pei had become known were disappointed, but the new hotel found more favour with government officials and architects.|$|E
5|$|Rhodri Morgan, Assembly Member (AM) {{replaced}} Alun Michael AM, {{to become}} the First Secretary (now known as the First Minister) of the National Assembly on 15 February 2000. On 22 March, Morgan stopped all work on the project {{to carry out a}} complete review. The decision to stop the project was supported by a vote in the National Assembly on 6 April 2000. The review included the costs and construction risks of the new building, the timetable for the completion of the project <b>and</b> <b>consideration</b> of possible alternatives to the new building.|$|E

30|$|All {{teachers}} {{draw upon}} mathematical <b>and</b> pedagogical <b>considerations</b> {{to varying degrees}} as they teach. What one can imagine is that for any particular teacher, mathematical knowledge <b>and</b> <b>considerations,</b> <b>and</b> pedagogical knowledge <b>and</b> <b>considerations,</b> may {{be more or less}} rich and one or the other may dominate in the teacher’s decision-making. This paper suggests that university mathematicians’ in-the-moment decision-making is significantly shaped by their mathematical knowledge <b>and</b> <b>considerations.</b> It also suggests that a form of professional development that focuses on having teachers elaborate on content considerations, what they believe is central about student learning, and their goals for instruction, can serve as a mechanism for productive reflections on teaching.|$|R
5|$|Teresa Cristina {{had grown}} to be {{a vital part of}} PedroII's family life and routine. She never filled the roles of romantic lover or {{intellectual}} partner, however. Her devotion to the Emperor remained firm, though she feared being supplanted. She continued to appear with the Emperor in public, and he continued to treat her with respect <b>and</b> <b>consideration.</b> She was not rejected or slighted, but the relationship had changed. Pedro II treated her more as a close friend and companion than as a wife.|$|E
5|$|The Emir's brother, Prime Minister Nasrullah Khan, {{was a man}} of {{religious}} convictions. Unlike the Emir, he fluently spoke Pashto (the local language), dressed in traditional Afghan robes, and interacted more closely with the border tribes. While the Emir favoured British India, Nasrullah Khan was more pro-German in his sympathies. Nasrullah's views were shared by his nephew, Amanullah Khan, the youngest and most charismatic of the Emir's sons. The eldest son, Inayatullah Khan, {{was in charge of the}} Afghan army. The mission therefore expected more sympathy <b>and</b> <b>consideration</b> from Nasrullah and Amanullah than from the emir.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth in}} Commercial Air Transport (CAT) has eroded the {{operational}} freedom of GA, {{both in the}} air and on the ground at larger airports. Difficulty with access to larger airports is compounded by a {{decline in the number of}} aerodromes generally, and existing sites are often threatened with closure and re-development for more profitable uses. The UK planning system is designed to focus on local issues, <b>and</b> <b>consideration</b> of the national impact of GA operations is not within its remit. This makes aerodrome development difficult, often subjecting those that successfully negotiate the process to restrictions in use.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, Croatian President Franjo Tuđman was in the building, meeting Stjepan Mesić, then President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and Ante Marković, then Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, but none of them were injured in the attack. In {{immediate}} aftermath, Tuđman remarked that the attack was apparently meant to destroy the Banski dvori as the seat of the statehood of Croatia. Marković blamed Yugoslav Defence Secretary General Veljko Kadijević, who denied the accusation and suggested the event was staged by Croatia. The attack prompted international condemnation <b>and</b> <b>consideration</b> of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia. The presidential residence was immediately moved to the Presidential palace, which was formerly known as Villa Zagorje. The Banski dvori sustained significant damage, but repairs started only in 1995. The building later became the seat of the Croatian Government.|$|E

25|$|Anti-social {{behavior}} {{is often seen}} as public behavior that lacks judgement <b>and</b> <b>consideration</b> for others and may damage them or their property.

The counterpart of anti-social {{behavior is}} pro-social behavior, namely any behavior intended to help or benefit another person, group or society.|$|E
