50|$|Starting on 16 February 1946 France disentangled the Saar {{area and}} {{established}} the separate Saar Protectorate, further <b>attaching</b> <b>parts</b> of the Prussian Rhine Province and the Bavarian Palatinate (Saarpfalz). Like the former eastern territories of Germany the Saar area {{was out of}} the jurisdiction of the Allied Control Council for Germany and thus no part of Allied-occupied Germany. However, unlike the eastern territories the domestic Saar population was not expelled by the controlling French. With effect of 1 January 1957 the Saar Protectorate declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany, as provided by its Grundgesetz (constitution) art. 23 (Little Reunification), thus becoming the new federal state of Saarland.|$|E

Other documents have a more sentimental value: they include Malibran's travel watercolours {{as well as a}} small sketchbook by her hand, revealing her unsuspected drawing talent. This aptitude also transpires in the two surprising La Réforme du Théâtre volumes, an initiative of the singer to modernize theatre costumes and assembling some fifty colour projects.|$|E
40|$|In {{the square}} tube {{subjected}} to the bending load, the rigidity of the entire square tube is reduced when a collapse occurs due to local stress concentration. Therefore, in this research, the influence of bending load on the square tube with <b>attached</b> energy absorbing <b>part</b> was examined and reported. The analysis was conducted by using Finite Element Method (FEM) to produced bending deflection and buckling points. Energy absorption was compared from rigidity of <b>attached</b> <b>part</b> and square tube body.

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} OrthoJacket {{is to develop a}} lightweight, portable, and active {{orthosis}} for the upper limps. The system consists of two special designed fluidic actuators which are used for supporting the elbow function and the internal rotation of the shoulder. A new design of flexible fluid actuator (FFA) is presented that enables more design options of <b>attaching</b> <b>parts,</b> as it is allowed by conventional actuators with a stationary centre of rotation. This advantage and the inherent flexibility and the low weight of this kind of actuator predestined them for the use in exoskeletons, orthoses, and prostheses. The actuator for the elbow generates a maximum torque of 32 [*]Nm; the internal rotation is supported with 7 [*]Nm. Both actuators support the movement with up to 100 % of the necessary power. The shells for the arm and forearm are made of carbon reinforced structures in combination with inflatable cushions...|$|E
30|$|To {{address this}} situation, we propose {{the use of}} a co-worker robot called PaDY (in-time Parts/tools Delivery to You robot [3]). The co-worker robot is not {{directly}} involved in the assembly processes but rather performs nonessential tasks to support human workers. This robot supports the human worker in <b>attaching</b> <b>parts</b> to an automobile in the assembly line by delivering the required parts and tools to the worker. Because this reduces the time spent on walking to the workbench and selecting parts and tools, this system improves the work efficiency and reduces unnecessary labor. Hoffman et al. [4, 5] also proposed a cooperative robot system that selects the next task by itself based on the validity and risk of each action. Hayakawa et al. [6] proposed an assembly system whereby the robot works with the human by determining the work state based on a self-organizing map. Tan et al. [7] proposed a collaborative working system in a cell production system.|$|E

40|$|It appears most {{probable}} that the Watts linkage {{of the aircraft}} has experienced a tensile overload superimposed with bending stresses during {{which one of the}} bolts of the fork connector between the pogo stick and the frame got sheared off. Evidences also suggest that both the bolts of the fork connector were present at the time of failure and there were no abnormalities in the assembly. Tell tale marks on the inner surface of the fork of the link assembly suggest that the bolt connecting the lever and the link assembly of the control linkage port PFCU was present prior to the accident. Evidences also suggest that this joint has experienced compressive force due to impact leading to shearing off of the bolt and subsequent dislodgement of all the <b>attaching</b> <b>parts.</b> Certain damages were seen on the bolts and/or nuts of control linkage starboard PFCU and engine throttle control linkage in question, which probably have been caused by split pins. This means that split pins were present in these bolts at some given time during their service life. It was not possible to ascertain whether or not these bolts were fitted with split pins prior to the accident. ...|$|E
40|$|The visual {{representation}} of shape reduces a high-dimensional input into a smaller set of more informative features. These features can span {{a range of}} abstractions from shallow features based on statistical summaries of images, to deep features related to the generative causes of the shapes. Here we examined {{the depth of the}} visual system’s {{representation of}} shape by comparing human judgments of whether novel shapes appeared to belong to a common class with a range of models with different shape representations. Each shape class was based on a unique 2 D base shape, formed by <b>attaching</b> <b>parts</b> of contours from different naturalistic shapes. We generated novel samples by transforming the base shape’s skeletal representation (Feldman and Singh, 2006) to produce new shapes with limbs that varied in length, width, spatial position, and orientation relative to the base shape. Multiple related classes were derived from each base shape using different distributions of parameter values. On each trial, observers judged whether the given target shape was in the same class as the given context shapes(either one or sixteen samples drawn from a particular shape class). Target shapes were samples taken from the same shape class as the context or one of the 5 related classes. Participants perform remarkably well given the ill-posed nature of the task. Models based on shallow features (Euclidean distance and shape area), and deep features (an ideal observer model with knowledge on the distribution of skeletal parts), were evaluated in terms of trial-by-trial consistency with the human data. In general, human responses indicated generalization beyond the context class and were best described by ideal and sub-optimal observer models suggesting that shape features for novel object classes are an abstract version of the underlying deep features...|$|E
