These bathhouses served as informal gay meeting places, places where friends could meet and relax. Gay bathhouses frequently threw parties for Pride Day and were usually open, and busy, on public holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, when some gay men, {{particularly those who}} had been rejected by their families due to their sexual orientation, had nowhere else to go.

40|$|In this paper, {{we define}} the spaces with <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> base <b>at</b> non-isolated points and discuss some metrization theorems. We firstly {{show that a}} space X is a metrizable space, {{if and only if}} X is <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> space with <b>a</b> σ-locally finite base at non-isolated points, if and only if X is a perfect space with <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> base <b>at</b> non-isolated points, if and only if X is a β-space with <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> base <b>at</b> non-isolated points. In addition, we also discuss the {{relations}} between the spaces with <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> base <b>at</b> non-isolated points and some generalized metrizable spaces. Finally, we give an affirmative answer for a question posed by F. C. Lin and S. Lin in LL, which also shows that a space with <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> base <b>at</b> non-isolated points has a point-countable base. Comment: 12 page...|$|R

5|$|Stengel {{also participated}} in Old-Timers' Day {{at a number of}} ballparks, including, regularly, Shea Stadium. In 1970, the Yankees invited him to Old-Timers' Day, at which his number, 37, was to be retired. By this time, the Yankee {{ownership}} had changed, and the people responsible for his dismissal were no longer with the team. He accepted and attended, and Stengel became the fifth Yankee to have his number retired. He thereafter became <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>at</b> the Yankees' Old-Timers' Day.|$|E
5|$|Tensions began rising between Lhermitte and her husband. Moqadem {{would spend}} long {{hours away from}} home, {{becoming}} <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>at</b> a bar and a spa. In addition, he would take several trips each year to visit his family in Marrakesh, with the length of each trip ranging from a week to a month. Lhermitte's first son and fifth child, Mehdi, was born on August 9, 2003. The following year, Schaar recommended that Lhermitte should see a psychiatrist and she began consulting the psychiatrist Dr. Diderick Veldekens in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, a {{few months}} after the {{publication}} of Tintin and the Picaros, Hergé told the journalist Numa Sadoul that he was contemplating the next adventure of Tintin—setting an entire story in an airport lounge. This idea was dropped, and in 1978, he decided to set the story in the world of modern art. During his later years Hergé had grown increasingly interested in this subject, and decided to incorporate his love of avant-garde artwork into the new story. Being <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>at</b> Brussels' art galleries and exhibitions, he was able to draw directly upon his experiences in the art scene when producing the story. Given his age, and the length of time that it was taking him to produce each Adventure, British literary critic Michael Farr suggested that Hergé likely knew that this would be his final installment in the series.|$|E

5|$|On 4 March, Richards' partner Anita Pallenberg {{pleaded guilty}} to drug {{possession}} and incurred a fine {{in connection with the}} original airport incident. The drug case against Richards dragged on for over a year. Ultimately, Richards received a suspended sentence and was ordered to play two free concerts for the CNIB in Oshawa; both shows featured the Rolling Stones and the New Barbarians, a group that Wood had put together to promote his latest solo album, and which Richards also joined. This episode strengthened Richards' resolve to stop using heroin. It also ended his relationship with Pallenberg, which had become strained since the death of their third child, Tara. Pallenberg was unable to curb her heroin addiction while Keith struggled to get clean. While Richards was settling his legal and personal problems, Jagger continued his jet-set lifestyle. He was <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>at</b> New York's Studio 54 disco club, often in the company of model Jerry Hall. His marriage to Bianca Jagger ended in 1977, although they had long been estranged.|$|E
5|$|One of President Garfield's more wearying duties {{was seeing}} office seekers, {{and he saw}} Guiteau at least once. White House {{officials}} suggested to Guiteau that he approach Blaine, as the consulship was within the Department of State. Blaine also saw the public regularly, and Guiteau became <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>at</b> these sessions. Blaine, who {{had no intention of}} giving Guiteau a position he was unqualified for and had not earned, simply stated that the deadlock in the Senate over Robertson's nomination made it impossible to consider the Paris consulship, which required Senate confirmation. Once the New York senators had resigned, and Robertson had been confirmed as Collector, Guiteau pressed his claim, and Blaine told him he would not receive the position.|$|E
