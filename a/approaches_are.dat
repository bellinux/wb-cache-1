5|$|Comprehensive <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> {{being looked}} at to address the rising rates of obesity. The Obesity Policy Action (OPA) {{framework}} divides measure into 'upstream' policies, 'midstream' policies, 'downstream' policies. 'Upstream' policies look at changing society, 'midstream' policies try to alter individuals' behavior to prevent obesity, and 'downstream' policies try to treat currently afflicted people.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Cochrane has {{completed}} {{the first two}} steps introducing his interest-based rights approach; the third is outlining the approach itself as the appropriate means of understanding obligations to animals in political communities. Utilitarianism, as advocated by Peter Singer, is rejected because of its failure to take individuals seriously enough; Cochrane desires an account which takes well-being seriously but is not purely aggregative. This, he suggests, is one based on interest rights. After explicating {{the details of his}} interest-based rights approach, Cochrane defends it against the charge that it would result in an unworkably large number of rights, and that rights <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> too rationalistic.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{a finite}} element {{recovery}} <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> {{proposed to improve}} the accuracy of finite element approximations for Green’s functions in three dimensions. This recovery <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> based on some simple postprocessing. It is proved by both theory and numerics that the recovery <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> very efficient. In particular, the <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> successfully applied to some electrostatic potential computations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} classifying semantically similar nouns. The <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> based on the "distributional hypothesis".

5|$|Multi-scale {{camouflage}} {{is a type}} {{of military}} camouflage combining patterns at two or more scales, often (though not necessarily) with a digital camouflage pattern created with computer assistance. The function is to provide camouflage over a range of distances, or equivalently over a range of scales (scale-invariant camouflage), in the manner of fractals, so some <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> called fractal camouflage. Not all multiscale patterns are composed of rectangular pixels, even if they were designed using a computer. Further, not all pixellated patterns work at different scales, so being pixellated or digital does not of itself guarantee improved performance.|$|E
5|$|NY23 {{has three}} {{distinct}} sections: its western third in Central New York and the Central New York Region (formerly Leatherstocking), the middle in the Catskills, {{and east of}} the Hudson River. Most of the route is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT); however, some sections are either locally maintained or owned by other agencies. In the city of Norwich, NY23 is entirely city-owned and maintained. Farther east {{in the city of}} Oneonta, the route is city-maintained from the western city line to James F. Lettis Highway. Finally, the Rip Van Winkle Bridge and its <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> maintained by the New York State Bridge Authority (NYSBA).|$|E
5|$|Plant {{defenses}} can {{be classified}} generally as constitutive or induced. Constitutive defenses are always present in the plant, while induced defenses are produced or mobilized to the site where a plant is injured. There is wide variation in the composition and concentration of constitutive defenses and these range from mechanical defenses to digestibility reducers and toxins. Many external mechanical defenses and large quantitative defenses are constitutive, as they require large amounts of resources to produce and are difficult to mobilize. A variety of molecular and biochemical <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> {{used to determine the}} mechanism of constitutive and induced plant defenses responses against herbivory.|$|E
40|$|This project {{introduces}} a Java and Python source code searching capability to Yioop [1]. Yioop is a PHP-based search engine. This feature enables users to search Java and Python source code files by entering Java or Python code snippets {{in the search}} bar of the search engine. In this project, a logarithmic char-gramming approach and a suffix tree <b>approach</b> <b>were</b> implemented and compared. In Yioop, the logarithmic char-gramming <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> newly implemented; whereas, an existing suffix tree <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> extended to operate on tokenized source codes. On comparing performance and effectiveness of these two <b>approaches,</b> it <b>was</b> found that the suffix trees <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> the better <b>approach.</b> The two methods returned comparable results, but the suffix tree <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> much faster for indexing...|$|R
40|$|A {{statistical}} linearization <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> {{applied to}} {{problems of the}} stationary random response of nonlinear multidegree-of-freedom dynamical systems. The <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> formulated {{in such a way}} that the resulting linear system parameters have a simple physical interpretation and can often be determined analytically. The accuracy of the <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> investigated by means of examples...|$|R
25|$|The {{traditional}} <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> to {{have only}} one, infinite, set of non-logical symbols (one signature) for all applications. Consequently, under the traditional <b>approach</b> there <b>is</b> only one language of first-order logic. This <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> still common, especially in philosophically oriented books.|$|R
5|$|Several {{therapeutic}} <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> in use {{or under}} investigation {{to treat the}} most common serpinopathy: antitrypsin deficiency. Antitrypsin augmentation therapy is approved for severe antitrypsin deficiency-related pulmonary emphysema. In this therapy, antitrypsin is purified from the plasma of blood donors and administered intravenously (first marketed as Prolastin). To treat severe antitrypsin deficiency-related disease, lung and liver transplantation has proven effective. In animal models, gene targeting in {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} has been successfully used to correct an antitrypsin polymerisation defect and to restore the ability of the mammalian liver to secrete active antitrypsin. Small molecules have also been developed that block antitrypsin polymerisation in vitro.|$|E
5|$|The BCG vaccine has limitations, and {{research}} {{to develop new}} TB vaccines is ongoing. A number of potential candidates are currently in phase I and II clinical trials. Two main <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> being used to attempt to improve the efficacy of available vaccines. One approach involves adding a subunit vaccine to BCG, while the other strategy is attempting to create new and better live vaccines. MVA85A, {{an example of a}} subunit vaccine, currently in trials in South Africa, is based on a genetically modified vaccinia virus. Vaccines are hoped to {{play a significant role in}} treatment of both latent and active disease.|$|E
5|$|Tropical cyclone {{forecasting}} also {{relies on}} {{data provided by}} numerical weather models. Three main classes of tropical cyclone guidance models exist: Statistical models are based on an analysis of storm behavior using climatology, and correlate a storm's position and date to produce a forecast that {{is not based on}} the physics of the atmosphere at the time. Dynamical models are numerical models that solve the governing equations of fluid flow in the atmosphere; they are based on the same principles as other limited-area numerical weather prediction models but may include special computational techniques such as refined spatial domains that move along with the cyclone. Models that use elements of both <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> called statistical-dynamical models.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> {{applied by}} interpreters {{specifically to the}} book of Revelation, but Revelation occupies such a central place in Christian eschatology that it is worth mentioning them in this, more general, overview. Parallel approaches {{can also be used}} in the interpretation of other prophetic passages. These <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> by no means mutually exclusive and are usually combined to form a more complete and coherent interpretation. Nevertheless, it is helpful to have a conceptual understanding of them.|$|E

The proposed classification <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> based on a novel filtering technique, here entitled as extended extinction profile (EEP). The proposed classification <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> applied on two well-known data sets: Pavia University and Indian Pines; and the obtained results have been compared {{with one of the}} strongest filtering approaches in the literature named extended attribute profile (EAP).
