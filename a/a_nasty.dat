5|$|September 25, 1939: The 1939 California {{tropical}} storm made landfall near Long Beach. Winds were near 80km/h (50mph) and rain was near 12inches (300mm). At sea, 48people were killed. On land, 45 {{were killed in}} flooding, although these deaths may be partially attributable to <b>a</b> <b>nasty</b> thunderstorm immediately preceding the {{tropical storm}}. This is the only known landfall in California by a tropical cyclone at tropical storm strength, during the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Cyril, an eleven-year-old with <b>a</b> <b>nasty</b> {{penchant for}} making trouble, comes {{to stay at}} the Place for three months. While there, he {{frequently}} lies, sneakily torments Lad, and plays such horrible pranks on the staff that two quit. After he is caught kicking Lad in plain sight, the Master loses his temper and scolds him. Cyril goes into a rage and runs away in a snowstorm. He gets lost and falls off a high cliff, landing on a small ledge. Lad finds him there, but has to jump down to the ledge to save the boy from a bobcat. Now trapped with the boy, Lad keeps him warm until a rescue party arrives.|$|E
5|$|In the subplot, Bart cuts {{school on}} the day {{students}} were choosing their physical education classes. By the time he shows up, the only option left is ballet. Despite being reluctant at first, he soon discovers {{that he has a}} talent for the dance form, and is invited to star in a school ballet performance. After his performance, school bullies attempt to beat him up, and he runs away. Bart attempts to escape by jumping a trench, but fails to make it and takes <b>a</b> <b>nasty</b> fall. The bullies leave, while Lisa tells Bart how proud she is of him, that they are now kindred spirits.|$|E
5000|$|... 2 Live Crew {{returned}} to their utterly pornographic roots with 1991's Sports Weekend: <b>As</b> <b>Nasty</b> <b>As</b> They Wanna Be, Pt. 2, which was lambasted by many critics as running the sexually deviant lyrics of <b>As</b> <b>Nasty</b> <b>As</b> They Wanna Be into the ground. From Sport's Weekend onward, the Crew continued to make dirty rap and party rap.|$|R

25|$|Just as this hill, {{where the}} Germans are solidly entrenched, gives me <b>a</b> <b>nasty</b> feeling, solely because its gentle slopes are broken up by earthworks, which throw long shadows at sunset—just so shall I get feeling, of {{whatsoever}} definition, from a statue {{according to its}} slopes, varied to infinity.|$|E
25|$|Working with {{barbed wire}} was <b>a</b> <b>nasty</b> job under any circumstances, {{but when you}} were {{handling}} it {{in the dark and}} within a hundred yards of rifles and machine guns that would shoot at the least sound, you were doing one of the most nerve-wracking bits of work that could possibly be imagined...the slightest move might mean death for half your party.|$|E

5000|$|... 2 Live Crew is an American hip-hop {{group from}} Miami, Florida. They caused {{considerable}} controversy with the sexual themes in their work, particularly on their 1989 album <b>As</b> <b>Nasty</b> <b>As</b> They Wanna Be.|$|R

25|$|After {{the gang}} {{comes to a}} circus, Lisa entertains the patrons of an under-used merry-go-round. As night falls, she reunites with her horse, Blanka (Zorka), after hearing its neigh. But <b>a</b> <b>nasty</b> {{surprise}} awaits everyone: Dirty Rat makes a deal with Lisa's ringmaster in which he vows to reach Marco's house with a fast horse, and steal the family chest. Lapitch and friends plan to stop him for good when they hear this.|$|E
25|$|The red body, slow {{peculiar}} flight, bright colouration {{and pattern}} of the wings are meant to indicate to predators that this butterfly is inedible, being well protected by the poisons it has sequestered from its larval food plant. It also emits <b>a</b> <b>nasty</b> smelling substance when handled to further enhance its unappealing qualities. Hence it is rarely attacked by predators, a strategy so successful, that edible butterflies have evolved to mimic it, the classic example being that of the female morph of the common Mormon that is Papilio polytes, female form stichius.|$|E
25|$|Like his predecessor, Lunalilo {{failed to}} name an {{heir to the}} throne. Once again, the {{legislature}} of the Kingdom of Hawaii needed an election to fill the royal vacancy. Queen Emma, widow of Kamehameha IV, was nominated along with David Kalākaua. The 1874 election was <b>a</b> <b>nasty</b> political campaign in which both candidates resorted to mudslinging and innuendo. David Kalākaua became the second elected King of Hawaii but without the ceremonial popular vote of Lunalilo. The choice of the legislature was controversial, and U.S. and British troops were called upon to suppress rioting by Queen Emma's supporters, the Emmaites.|$|E
5000|$|A humorous, and profane, remake {{was also}} done by the American comedian Andrew [...] "Dice" [...] Clay, {{as well as the}} 2 Live Crew in the song [...] "Dirty Nursery Rhymes" [...] on <b>As</b> <b>Nasty</b> <b>As</b> They Wanna Be.|$|R

25|$|Although the {{freshwater}} crocodile {{does not}} attack humans as potential prey, it can deliver <b>a</b> <b>nasty</b> bite. There {{have been very}} few incidents where people have been bitten whilst swimming with freshwater crocodiles, and others incurred during scientific study. An attack by a freshwater crocodile on a human was recorded at Barramundi Gorge (also known as Maguk) in Kakadu National Park and resulted in minor injuries; the victim managed to swim and {{walk away from the}} attack. He had apparently passed directly over the crocodile in the water. However, in general, it is still considered safe to swim with this species, so long as they are not aggravated.|$|E
25|$|The Allies {{staggered}} {{into their}} base at Ciudad Rodrigo on 19 November. Two-fifths of the army's soldiers were either ill or missing. The humor of {{the rank and}} file was not improved when Wellington issued <b>a</b> <b>nasty</b> letter to his division and brigade commanders and it was leaked to the press. A total of 5,000 men were missing. While many of the missing were on the way to French prison camps, the majority had died from starvation or hypothermia. Though the Allied army had apparently been defeated, in fact much had been accomplished in 1812. The French had been ejected from the cities of Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Seville, and Astorga, and the provinces of Andalusia, Extremadura, and Asturias.|$|E
25|$|The {{two were}} quickly {{joined by a}} {{counter-attack}} from Axel Merckx and Sandy Casar; Boogerd and Lefevre sat up and allowed those two to join them. Casar struck a dog on the road when he and Frederick Willems were chasing Boogerd and Lefevre, {{and both of them}} went down. Casar got up quickly, but Willems was slower and wound up being absorbed by the peloton. The crash resulted in Casar tearing his gear and having to ride with <b>a</b> <b>nasty</b> wound on his exposed buttocks, since dropping off to change and have the wound treated would cost him his position. Later, the race doctor's car made it up to the leading group to tend to Casar's hip and right elbow, as well as a bee sting sustained by Boogerd.|$|E

25|$|In 1986 Hadlee helped New Zealand to a 1–0 series win in England, {{their first}} over that country in England. Hadlee's {{outstanding}} personal {{performance in the}} second test at Nottingham (his county 'home') where he took 10 wickets and scored 68 in New Zealand's first innings powered his team to victory. In this test Hadlee, often a controversial character, added to this side of his reputation when he felled (and hospitalised) England wicketkeeper and Nottinghampshire teammate Bruce French with <b>a</b> <b>nasty</b> bouncer. During the New Zealand v West Indies test at Christchurch in March 1987, Hadlee and captain Jeremy Coney had a disagreement {{in the dressing room}} prior to the game. It progressed to not talking to each other on the field, communicating through John Wright at mid-on.|$|E
25|$|Scrooge has <b>a</b> <b>nasty</b> {{temper and}} rarely hesitates to use cartoon {{violence}} {{against those who}} provoke his ire (often his nephew Donald, but also bill and tax collectors as well as door-to-door salesmen); however, {{he seems to be}} against the use of lethal force. On occasion, he has even saved the lives of enemies who had threatened his own life but were in danger of losing their own. According to Scrooge's own explanation, this is to save himself from feelings of guilt over their deaths; he generally awaits no gratitude from them. Scrooge has also opined that only in fairy tales do bad people turn good, and that he is old enough to not believe in fairy tales. Scrooge believes in keeping his word—never breaking a promise once given. In Italian-produced stories of the 1950s to 1970s, however, particularly those written by Guido Martina, Scrooge often acts differently from in American or Danish comics productions.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{it is well}} {{established}} that Caspar had been niggling Coleman since the very start of the match, which included making persistent and heavy contact with <b>a</b> <b>nasty</b> boil on Coleman's neck; and that Caspar had punched Coleman twice whilst play was {{at the other end}} of the ground, immediately before Coleman retaliated; and that, apart from his reaction to Caspar's thuggery, Coleman had not been proactive in any way. The match to that time had been a somewhat brutal encounter, and the crowd was highly agitated. During the match bottles were thrown at Coleman, and as he came off the ground at half-time, and walked up the players race, a Carlton fan spat at him through gaps in the cyclone wired barriers that separated the spectators from the players. Coleman snapped, and smashed the fan in the face, badly hurting his hand. He went into the Essendon rooms, shouting with rage at the total absence of any protection from the match officials, took off his jumper, and spoke of not returning to the field.|$|E
5000|$|The eponymous title single is a {{reference}} to the decision in a court case that its album <b>As</b> <b>Nasty</b> <b>As</b> They Wanna Be was obscene (the decision would later be overturned on appeal). Bruce Springsteen granted the group permission to interpolate his song [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] for it.|$|R
5000|$|A snippet of the moan was double-tracked {{and used}} in the 1972 novelty {{break-in}} record, [...] "Convention '72" [...] by The Delegates. In addition, [...] "Jungle Fever" [...] has been often sampled in hip-hop, including by Miami rap group 2 Live Crew in their track [...] "Put Her in the Buck", which was featured on their 1989 album <b>As</b> <b>Nasty</b> <b>As</b> They Wanna Be.|$|R
50|$|Miller {{continued}} {{to deal with}} controversy with {{an account of the}} obscenity trials of 2 Live Crew.
