5|$|A solicitor, {{businessman}} <b>and</b> <b>citizen</b> soldier {{before his}} entry into politics, Gould {{was a member}} of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1882 to 1898, during which time he served as Minister for Justice in two Free Trade governments. He later served two years in the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1899 to 1901 until his election to the Australian Senate. Gould's interest in parliamentary procedure saw him become involved with the relevant standing committee and he was elected unopposed as the second President of the Senate in 1907. His tenure is remembered as more traditionalist and Anglophilic than his predecessor's.|$|E
5|$|Sarmiento {{believed}} that the material and social needs of people had to be satisfied {{but not at the}} cost of order and decorum. He put great importance on law <b>and</b> <b>citizen</b> participation. These ideas he most equated to Rome and to the United States, a society which he viewed as exhibiting similar qualities. In order to civilize the Argentine society and make it equal to that of Rome or the United States, Sarmiento believed in eliminating the caudillos, or the larger landholdings and establishing multiple agricultural colonies run by European immigrants.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Constitution {{adopted in}} 1848 {{is the legal}} {{foundation}} of the modern federal state. It is among the oldest constitutions in the world. A new Constitution was adopted in 1999, but did not introduce notable changes to the federal structure. It outlines basic and political rights of individuals <b>and</b> <b>citizen</b> participation in public affairs, divides the powers between the Confederation and the cantons and defines federal jurisdiction and authority. There are three main governing bodies on the federal level: the bicameral parliament (legislative), the Federal Council (executive) and the Federal Court (judicial).|$|E
40|$|Since its {{accession}} to the European Community in 1985, Spain {{has been considered}} a pro-European country. However, in 2005 the referendum on the European Constitution revealed the existence of some fractures among parties, while Spaniards' acritical acceptance {{of the relationship between}} Spain and Europe has also been denounced. The article asks whether these developments suggest an increasing euroscepticism among Spanish political parties <b>and</b> <b>citizens.</b> It reviews the euroscepticism of Spanish parties <b>and</b> <b>citizens</b> <b>and</b> concludes with a reflection on the links between parties <b>and</b> <b>citizens...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{story was}} {{inspired}} by Florey's own experiences in Hollywood, {{as well as the}} George Gershwin composition Rhapsody in Blue. It {{was one of the first}} films shot by Gregg Toland, who later received acclaim for his work on such films as The Grapes of Wrath (1939) <b>and</b> <b>Citizen</b> Kane (1941). The film serves as a satire of the social conditions, dominant practices, and ideologies of Hollywood, as well as the film industry's perceived mistreatment of actors. Douglas Fairbanks assisted with the development of the film, and Charlie Chaplin and Joseph M. Schenck helped promote it.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, the Supreme Court held in Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer) (2002), that a {{statutory}} provision prohibiting prisoners serving {{a sentence of}} two years or more from voting unjustifiably infringed the fundamental right to vote guaranteed by section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court noted that the Government could not demonstrate how denying prisoners the vote helped the stated aims of the relevant statute; a democracy built on inclusiveness, democracy <b>and</b> <b>citizen</b> participation cannot be party to a law that disenfranchises a considerable part of the population. There was also no credible theory why prisoners should be {{denied the right to}} vote as a form of punishment, as it is arbitrary and not related to the offender's criminal act nor does it deter crime or rehabilitate criminals.|$|E
5|$|RKO {{has long}} been celebrated for its series of musicals {{starring}} Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in the mid-to-late 1930s. Actors Katharine Hepburn and, later, Robert Mitchum had their first major successes at the studio. Cary Grant was a mainstay for years. The work of producer Val Lewton's low-budget horror unit and RKO's many ventures into the field now known as film noir have been acclaimed, largely after the fact, by film critics and historians. The studio produced {{two of the most}} famous films in motion picture history: King Kong <b>and</b> <b>Citizen</b> Kane. RKO was also known for being the distributor to a significant portion of Walt Disney's animated feature films, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937 to Peter Pan in 1953.|$|E

5|$|The day of 14 August {{witnessed}} heavy {{deployment of}} security forces, which used {{tear gas and}} birdshot against hundreds-to-thousands of protesters who gathered in several locations throughout the country. Many shops were closed in response to Tamarod's call for a general strike. Opposition activists and media reported over 60 demonstrations throughout the country. The opposition and several citizens accused authorities of cutting Internet connections. The government blocked a website covering the protests, but activists <b>and</b> <b>citizen</b> journalists provided live coverage on social media websites, and Anonymous targeted a government website. At least twenty protesters were arrested and ten injured, two critically, activists said. The tightened security measures have succeeded in preventing large-scale protests in Manama. On 15 and 16 August, smaller protests occurred in several locations which police dispersed without injuries.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} day of the term, 26 November 1992, the {{following}} parliamentary groups were registered: Christian Democrats, Sąjūdis, Citizen Charter, Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania, Social Democrats of Lithuania. While politically aligned, Christian Democrats, Sąjūdis <b>and</b> <b>Citizen</b> Charter formed three separate political groups in the Seimas in order to secure more seats in parliamentary committees. Nevertheless, the alignment fractured, as the Political Prisoners and Deportees and the Democratic Party left the political group of Christian Democrats, while only 23 of the 30 members of Sąjūdis <b>and</b> <b>Citizen</b> Charter joined the parliamentary group of Homeland Union-Lithuanian Conservatives.|$|E
