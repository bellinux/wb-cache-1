5|$|From his Oxford years onward, Auden's friends uniformly {{described}} him <b>as</b> <b>funny,</b> extravagant, sympathetic, generous, and, partly {{by his own}} choice, lonely. In groups he was often dogmatic and overbearing in a comic way; in more private settings he was diffident and shy except when certain of his welcome. He was punctual in his habits, and obsessive about meeting deadlines, while choosing to live amidst physical disorder.|$|E
5|$|When God Writes Your Love Story was {{received}} positively by some American Christian authors. In Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom, Mark Matlock, an ordained minister and youth pastor recommends When God Writes Your Love Story to college students. He describes the Ludys' book <b>as</b> <b>funny,</b> honest, and candid. Jason Evert, a Catholic author and chastity speaker, wrote positively of When God Writes Your Love Story {{in his book}} If You Really Loved Me: 100 Questions on Dating, Relationships, and Sexual Purity. Evert commends Leslie Ludy writing {{about the importance of}} listening intently and regularly to God's voice in seeking discernment about romantic relationships. Also in If You Really Loved Me, Evert praises a passage from When God Writes Your Love Story in which Leslie Ludy recalls having spoken with a group of young men who all agreed that the most desirable women were those who were slow to establish strong emotional attachments to potential romantic partners, and that the least desirable women were those who were emotionally promiscuous. According to Evert, these men are right; he uses the passage to support his argument that lack of sexual experience is attractive.|$|E

25|$|Charlton Comics {{published}} {{a wide variety}} of genres, including crime, science fiction, Western, horror, war and romance comics, as well <b>as</b> <b>funny</b> animal and superhero titles.

40|$|Linguists {{have focused}} on humor and its typical genre, anecdotes, for a {{relatively}} long period of time. Czech linguistics analyzed mainly formal aspects of anecdotes, especially linguistic means (Bečka, 1946; Komárek, 1992). But anecdotes are not only text, they have also their place in communication. Abroad therefore much research {{was conducted on the}} evaluation of anecdotes, while special attention was repeatedly taken into account the effect of gender on this evaluation. One of the recent research was conducted in the USA by Abel and Flick (2012). The results of their research showed that women and men evaluated sexist anecdotes differently: both women and men deemed <b>as</b> <b>funnier</b> jokes directed towards the opposite sex. To compare the results of this research with my own research conducted on Czech speakers, I created two versions of the questionnaire, which contained 24 anecdots of different kinds (basis of humor: verbal, situational, absurd jokes; overall impression: positive, negative jokes; form: conversational jokes, riddles etc.). These anecdotes were evaluated on a scale not funny – very funny. It turned out that both women and men deem <b>as</b> <b>funnier</b> anecdotes directed towards the opposite sex, which corresponds to the results from Abel and Flick (2012). The questionnaire survey also showed that men compared to women assessed <b>as</b> <b>funnier</b> vulgar jokes and anecdotes from the field of black humor...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} verbal, visual, motor, and tactile humor {{appreciation and}} comprehension among preschool children with epilepsy {{as compared with}} healthy children.
