40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is {{compilation}} of computational model of thermal stage and heat recovery block of modern unit for thermal processing of municipal solid waste. The model is based on mass and enthalpy balances and it makes possible to estimate the value of energy transferred to water in secondary combustion chamber, outside the heat recovery blok. The model is verified by implementation of real operational data of an up-to-date unit with <b>annual</b> <b>capacity</b> of 100 <b>kt</b> for thermal processing of municipal solid waste and then it is used for analysis of changing input parameters, i. e. change in lower heating value of incinerated waste...|$|R

40|$|PV {{power systems}} have been commercially {{available}} and widely used for decades. The performance of a reliable PV system that fulfils the expectations requires correct input data and careful design. Inaccurate input data of the techno-economic feasibility would affect the size, cost aspects, stability and performance of PV power system on the long run. The <b>annual</b> <b>capacity</b> shortage {{is one of the}} main input data that should be selected with careful attention. The aim of this study is to reveal the effect of different <b>annual</b> <b>capacity</b> shortages on the techno-economic feasibility parameters and determining the optimal value for Baghdad city location using HOMER simulation tool. Six values of <b>annual</b> <b>capacity</b> shortage percentages (0 %, 1 %, 2 %, 3 %, 4 %, and 5 %), and wide daily load profile range (10 kWh - 100 kWh) are implemented. The optimal <b>annual</b> <b>capacity</b> shortage is the value that always “wins” when each techno-economic feasibility parameter is at its optimal/ reasonable criteria. The results showed that the optimal <b>annual</b> <b>capacity</b> shortage that reduces significantly the cost of PV power system while keeping the PV system with reasonable technical feasibility is 3 %. This capacity shortage value can be carried as a reference value in future works for Baghdad city location. Using this approach of analysis at other locations, <b>annual</b> <b>capacity</b> shortage can be always offered as a reference value for those locations...|$|R
