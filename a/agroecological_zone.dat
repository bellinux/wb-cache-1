The area of Banyumas regency is choosen as the area of research because it has <b>agroecological</b> <b>zone</b> that consists of upper, middle and lower zone along Serayu upper catchment area. Thirty horticultural plants farmers are selected randomly. They are interviewed to get data and information about land conservation behavior.

40|$|Changes in the {{agriculture}} sector {{are essential to}} mitigate and adapt to climate change, meet growing food demands, and improve the livelihoods of poor smallholder producers. What agricultural strategies are needed to meet these challenges? To what extent are there synergies among these strategies? This paper examines these issues for smallholder producers in Kenya across several <b>agroecological</b> <b>zones.</b> Several practices emerge as triple wins, supporting climate adaptation, greenhouse gas mitigation, and profitability goals. In particular, integrated soil fertility management and improved livestock feeding are shown to provide multiple benefits across all <b>agroecological</b> <b>zones</b> examined. Triple wins of other agricultural practices are limited to specific <b>agroecological</b> <b>zones.</b> Irrigation and soil and water conservation, for example, are essential for adaptation, mitigation, and profitability in arid areas. The results suggest that agricultural investments targeted toward these triple-win strategies will have the greatest payoff in terms of increased resilience of farm and pastoralist households and global climate change mitigation. To {{reap the benefits of}} triple-win strategies will require that policymakers, researchers, and practitioners move away from isolated approaches focused on either adaptation or mitigation or rural income generation toward a more holistic assessment of joint strategies as well as their tradeoffs and synergies...|$|R

40|$|Although the Ethiopian potato {{program has}} {{released}} more than 30 new varieties, selected primarily for yield potential and late blight tolerance, {{the majority of}} farmers still choose to grow older ‘local varieties’. Cognizant of this, the current study aimed to identify traits that farmers consider most important when deciding which varieties to grow. The study was conducted at two sites in northwest Ethiopia, representing two major <b>agroecological</b> <b>zones,</b> in two distinct growing seasons, using a participatory variety selection approach. Diseasefree seed tubers of nine local and three new varieties were planted. Twenty-three traits were found to influence the varieties that farmers selected and seven of them differed between <b>agroecological</b> <b>zones.</b> Gender differences were also observed for three of the 23 traits at Laigaint (submoist cool agroecology). Of the 23 traits, 12 were considered very important in {{one or both of}} the <b>agroecological</b> <b>zones</b> as well as in at least one growing season. At present eight of these 12 traits are not given high priority by the Ethiopian potato variety selection program. The results show that farmers′ selection criteria are very diverse, that no variety possesses all desirable characteristics, and that there is a need for selecting varieties adapted to different agroecologies and growing seasons. This study further suggests that taking farmer interests into account is important for a highly heterozygous, clonally-propagated crop like potato to be accepted by farmers...|$|R

The approach incorporated quantitative and qualitative assessment, with geotechnologies (satellite image–landsat 5, global positioning system, geographic information system, digital mapping, software of digital image processing) adoption to perform an integrated analysis of environmental data. Primary soils information associated with terrain attributes and climate characteristics were used with geotechnologies to evaluation of the natural erosion potential, natural fertility, internal drainage and moisture soil retention capacity of soil. The land use, and land cover and the environmental laws were observed. The integrated analysis of these data allowed environmental stratification in different <b>agroecological</b> <b>zones.</b> These zones are defined to agricultural use; pastures; conservation of natural resources or ecological restoration.

30|$|Crop wastes used in {{the study}} were the most {{available}} and accessible wastes in the study area with high potential to negatively impact the environment. These include; sawdust, rice husk, coffee and groundnut husk, cassava and corncobs. Apart from the chemical composition of feedstock, the availability of drying and storage facilities and means of transportation were also taken into account (Abrishamkesh et al. 2015; Djousse et al. 2016). Furthermore, competition for other uses of each waste was also considered among their multiple uses since crop wastes such as sawdust and corncobs were the major energy sources providing domestic energy in the study area. Cassava residues (leftovers of roots and stems of cassava after the edible parts mainly the starchy tuberous roots have been harvested on the farm), was collected from IRAD experimental farm in Nkolbisson.

This study assesses the prevalence of anemia and undernutrition among children aged 6 – 23 months in midland and lowland agroecological zones of rural Ethiopia. Methods: Cross-sectional data examining sociodemographic, anthropometry, hemoglobin levels, and meal frequency indicators were collected from 216 children aged 6 – 23 months and their mothers randomly selected from eight rural kebele (villages). Results: Of 216 children, 53. 7 % were anemic, and 39. 8 %, 26. 9 %, and 11. 6 % were stunted, underweight, and wasted, respectively. The prevalence of anemia was higher in the lowland <b>agroecological</b> <b>zone</b> (59. 5 %) than the midland (47. 6 %). Among those children who were stunted, underweight, and wasted, 63. 5 %, 66. 7 %, and 68. 0 % were anemic, respectively. Child anemia {{was significantly associated with}} the child not achieving minimum meal frequency, sickness during the last 2 weeks before the survey, stunting and low body mass index, and with maternal hemoglobin and handwashing behavior. The prevalence of stunting was higher in the lowland <b>agroecological</b> <b>zone</b> (42. 3 %) than the midland (36. 2 %). The predictors of stunting were age and sex of the child, not achieving MMF, maternal body mass index, and age. As maternal height increases, the length for age of the children increases (P= 0. 003). Conclusion: The overall prevalence of anemia and undernutrition among children aged 6 – 23  months in these study areas is very high. The prevalence was higher in the lowland <b>agroecological</b> <b>zone.</b> Health information strategies focusing on both maternal and children nutrition could be sensible approaches to minimize stunting and anemia.
