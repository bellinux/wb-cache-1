40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} the natural balancing theory for three level neutral point clamped multi?level inverters. An equation describing the natural balancing mechanisms is given <b>and</b> <b>discussed,</b> <b>and</b> a passive circuit to improve balancing is presented <b>and</b> <b>discussed.</b> Three different switching patterns for space vector modulation and the effects thereof are discussed with regards to experimental results. Finally, the results of balancing experiments with and without the balance booster are given <b>and</b> <b>discussed.</b> It is seen from these results that the balance booster circuit can drastically improve balancing for this topology.
