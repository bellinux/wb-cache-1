5|$|Four Class 66 {{units were}} {{ordered by the}} Norwegian State Railways (NSB) in 1939, {{to be used as}} express trains on the then newly or shortly-to-be {{electrified}} Sørland- and Østfold Lines. At the same time, similar Class 88 diesel multiple units were ordered for the non-electrified Bergen- and Dovre Lines. The trains were built by Strømmens Værksted, Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk and Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB). The diesel series was <b>assembled</b> <b>by</b> Strømmen, while Skabo assembled the electric version. NEBB delivered the motors for the units.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the human}} race become extinct, then the various {{features}} <b>assembled</b> <b>by</b> humanity will begin to decay. The largest structures have an estimated decay half-life of about 1,000years. The last surviving structures would most likely be open pit mines, large landfills, major highways, wide canal cuts, and earth-fill flank dams. A few massive stone monuments like the pyramids at the Giza Necropolis or the sculptures at Mount Rushmore may still survive in some form after a million years.|$|E
5|$|The {{carousel}} {{was commissioned}} by William Hubbs, who had it installed in White City Amusement Park in 1917.

The carousel was <b>assembled</b> <b>by</b> the William F. Mangels carousel company in 1917. It was probably not the first carousel in the park, as there are indications of a previous ride that came from Hartford, Connecticut.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} troops which Xerxes mustered for the second {{invasion}} of Greece {{has been the subject}} of endless dispute, most notably between ancient sources, which report very large numbers, and modern scholars, who surmise much smaller figures.

5|$|A {{squad of}} 16 members, {{built around the}} core of the former Rhodesia team, was hastily <b>assembled</b> <b>by</b> Liz Dreyer, the {{president}} of the national women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official was white. Ann Grant, the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. Anthea Stewart, who had played for South Africa 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. Liz Chase, the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while Arlene Boxall, the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in Sandy Chick and Sonia Robertson.|$|E
5|$|After a punitive {{operation}} {{was conducted in}} the surrounding villages, during which 422males were shot and four villages burned down, another 70male Jews and communists who had been arrested in Kragujevac were shot. Simultaneously, males {{between the ages of}} 16and 60, including high school students, were <b>assembled</b> <b>by</b> German troops and local collaborators, and the victims were selected from amongst them. The selected males were then marched to fields outside the city, shot with heavy machine guns, and their bodies buried in mass graves. Contemporary German military records indicate that 2,300hostages were shot. After the war, inflated estimates ranged as high as 7,000deaths, but German and Serbian scholars have now agreed on the figure of nearly 2,800killed, including 144high school students. As well as Serbs, other massacre victims included Jews, Romani people, Muslims, Macedonians, Slovenes and members of other nationalities.|$|E

5|$|Archaea flagella operate like {{bacterial}} flagella—their long stalks {{are driven}} by rotatory motors at the base. These motors are powered by the proton gradient across the membrane. However, archaeal flagella are notably different in composition and development. The two types of flagella evolved from different ancestors. The bacterial flagellum shares a common ancestor with the type III secretion system, while archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from bacterial type IV pili. In contrast to the bacterial flagellum, which is hollow and is <b>assembled</b> <b>by</b> subunits moving up the central pore {{to the tip of}} the flagella, archaeal flagella are synthesized by adding subunits at the base.|$|E
40|$|AbstractHomotetrameric {{proteins}} can <b>assemble</b> <b>by</b> {{several different}} pathways, but {{have only been}} observed to use one, in which two monomers associate to form a homodimer, and then two homodimers associate to form a homotetramer. To determine why this pathway should be so uniformly dominant, we have modeled the kinetics of tetramerization for the possible pathways {{as a function of}} the rate constants for each step. We have found that competition with the other pathways, in which homotetramers can be formed either by the association of two different types of homodimers or by the successive addition of monomers to homodimers and homotrimers, can cause substantial amounts of protein to be trapped as intermediates of the assembly pathway. We propose that this could lead to undesirable consequences for an organism, and that selective pressure may have caused homotetrameric proteins to evolve to <b>assemble</b> <b>by</b> a single pathway...|$|R

40|$|Roughly {{half of all}} animal {{somatic cell}} {{spindles}} <b>assemble</b> <b>by</b> the classical prophase pathway, in which the centrosomes separate ahead of nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD). The remainder <b>assemble</b> <b>by</b> the prometaphase pathway, in which the centrosomes separate following NEBD. Why cells use dual pathway spindle assembly is unclear. Here, by examining the timing of NEBD relative to the onset of Eg 5 -mEGFP loading to centrosomes, we show that a time window of 9. 2 ± 2. 9 min is available for Eg 5 -driven prophase centrosome separation ahead of NEBD, and that those cells that succeed in separating their centrosomes within this window subsequently show. 3 -fold fewer chromosome segregation errors and a somewhat faster mitosis. A longer time window would allow more cells to complete prophase centrosome separation and further reduce segregation errors, but {{at the expense of}} a slower mitosis. Our data reveal dual pathway mitosis in a new light, as a substantive strategy that increases both the speed and the fidelity of mitosis...|$|R
