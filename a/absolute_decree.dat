25|$|Barth's {{doctrine}} of election involves a firm rejection {{of the notion of}} an eternal, hidden decree. In keeping with his Christo-centric methodology, Barth argues that to ascribe the salvation or damnation of humanity to an abstract <b>absolute</b> <b>decree</b> is to make some part of God more final and definitive than God's saving act in Jesus Christ. God's <b>absolute</b> <b>decree,</b> if one may speak of such a thing, is God's gracious decision to be for humanity in the person of Jesus Christ. Drawing from the earlier Reformed tradition, Barth retains the notion of double predestination but makes Jesus himself the object of both divine election and reprobation simultaneously; Jesus embodies both God's election of humanity and God's rejection of human sin. While some regard this revision of the {{doctrine of}} election as an improvement on the Augustinian-Calvinist doctrine of the predestination of individuals, critics, namely Brunner, have charged that Barth's view amounts to a soft universalism, thereby departing from Augustinian-Calvinism.|$|E

60|$|Early in {{this year}} it had been again {{proposed}} in the Senate that Cæsar should give up his command. At this time the two Consuls, L. Æmilius Paulus and C. Claudius Marcellus, were opposed to Cæsar, as was also Curio, who {{had been one of}} Cicero's young friends, and was now Tribune. But two of these Cæsar managed to buy by the payment of enormous bribes. Curio was the more important of the two, and required the larger bribe. The story comes to us from Appian,[119] but the modern reader will find it efficiently told by Mommsen.[120] The Consul had fifteen hundred talents, or about £500,000! The sum named as that given by Cæsar to Curio was something greater, because he was so deeply in debt! Bribes to the amount of above a million of money, such as money is to us now, bestowed upon two men for their support in the Senate! It was worth a man's while to be a Consul or a Tribune in those days. But the money was well earned--plunder, no doubt, extracted from Gaul. The Senate decided that both Pompey and Cæsar should be required to abandon their commands--or rather they adopted a proposal to that effect without any <b>absolute</b> <b>decree.</b> But this sufficed for Cæsar, who was only anxious to be relieved from the necessity of obeying any order from the Senate by the knowledge that Pompey also was ordered, and also was disobedient. Then it was--in the summer of this year--that the two commanders were desired by the Senate to surrender each of them a legion, or about three thousand men, under the pretence that the forces were wanted for the Parthian war. The historians tell us that Pompey had lent a legion to Cæsar, thus giving us an indication of the singular terms on which legions were held by the proconsular officers who commanded them. Cæsar nobly sends up to Rome two legions, the one as having been ordered to be restored by himself, and the other as belonging to Pompey. He felt, no doubt, that a show of nobleness in this respect would do him better service than the withholding of the soldiers. The men were stationed at Capua, instead of being sent to the East, and no doubt drifted back into Cæsar's hands. The men who had served under Cæsar would not willingly find themselves transferred to Pompey.|$|E

[...] 430 [...] As when a Vultur on Imaus bred, [...] Whose snowie ridge the roving Tartar bounds, [...] Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey [...] To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids [...] On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs [...] Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams; [...] But in his way lights on the barren plaines [...] Of Sericana, where Chineses drive [...] With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light: [...] So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend [...] 440 [...] Walk'd up and down alone bent on his prey, [...] Alone, for other Creature in this place [...] Living or liveless to be found was none, [...] None yet, but store hereafter from the earth [...] Up hither like Aereal vapours flew [...] Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin [...] With vanity had filld the works of men: [...] Both all things vain, and all who in vain things [...] Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame, [...] Or happiness in this or th' other life; [...] 450 [...] All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits [...] Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal, [...] Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find [...] Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds; [...] All th' unaccomplisht works of Natures hand, [...] Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt, [...] Dissolvd on earth, fleet hither, and in vain, [...] Till final dissolution, wander here, [...] Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd; [...] Those argent Fields more likely habitants, [...] 460 [...] Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold [...] Betwixt th' Angelical and Human kinde: [...] Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born [...] First from the ancient World those Giants came [...] With many a vain exploit, though then renownd: [...] The builders next of Babel on the Plain [...] Of Sennaar, and still with vain designe [...] New Babels, had they wherewithall, would build: [...] Others came single; hee who to be deemd [...] A God, leap'd fondly into Aetna flames, [...] 470 [...] Empedocles, and hee who to enjoy [...] Plato's Elysium, leap'd into the Sea, [...] Cleombrotus, and many more too long, [...] Embryo's and Idiots, Eremits and Friers [...] White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie. [...] Here Pilgrims roam, that stray'd so farr to seek [...] In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heav'n; [...] And they who {{to be sure of}} Paradise [...] Dying put on the weeds of Dominic, [...] Or in Franciscan think to pass disguis'd; [...] 480 [...] They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt, [...] And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs [...] The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov'd; [...] And now Saint Peter at Heav'ns Wicket seems [...] To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot [...] Of Heav'ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe [...] A violent cross wind from either Coast [...] Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry [...] Into the devious Air; then might ye see [...] Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost [...] 490 [...] And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads, [...] Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls, [...] The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft [...] Fly o're the backside of the World farr off [...] Into a Limbo large and broad, since calld [...] The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown [...] Long after, now unpeopl'd, and untrod; [...] All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass'd, [...] And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame [...] Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste [...] 500 [...] His travell'd steps; farr distant hee descries [...] Ascending by degrees magnificent [...] Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high, [...] At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd [...] The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate [...] With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold [...] Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes [...] The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth [...] By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn. [...] The Stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw [...] 510 [...] Angels ascending and descending, bands [...] Of Guardians bright, when he from Esau fled [...] To Padan-aram in the field of Luz, [...] Dreaming by night under the open Skie, [...] And waking cri'd, This is the Gate of Heav'n. [...] Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood [...] There alwaies, but drawn up to Heav'n somtimes [...] Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow'd [...] Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon [...] Who after came from Earth, sayling arriv'd, [...] 520 [...] Wafted by Angels, or flew o're the Lake [...] Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds. [...] The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare [...] The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate [...] His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss. [...] Direct against which op'nd from beneath, [...] Just o're the blissful seat of Paradise, [...] A passage down to th' Earth, a passage wide, [...] Wider by farr then that of after-times [...] Over Mount Sion, and, though that were large, [...] 530 [...] Over the Promis'd Land to God so dear, [...] By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes, [...] On high behests his Angels to and fro [...] Pass'd frequent, and his eye with choice regard [...] From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood [...] To Beersaba, where the Holy Land [...] Borders on Aegypt and the Arabian shoare; [...] So wide the op'ning seemd, where bounds were set [...] To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave. [...] Satan from hence now on the lower stair [...] 540 [...] That scal'd by steps of Gold to Heav'n Gate [...] Looks down with wonder at the sudden view [...] Of all this World at once. As when a Scout [...] Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone [...] All night; at last by break of chearful dawne [...] Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill, [...] Which to his eye discovers unaware [...] The goodly prospect of some forein land [...] First-seen, or some renownd Metropolis [...] With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd, [...] 550 [...] Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams. [...] Such wonder seis'd, though after Heaven seen, [...] The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis'd [...] At sight of all this World beheld so faire. [...] Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood [...] So high above the circling Canopie [...] Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point [...] Of Libra to the fleecie Starr that bears [...] Andromeda farr off Atlantick Seas [...] Beyond th' Horizon; then from Pole to Pole [...] 560 [...] He views in bredth, and without longer pause [...] Down right into the Worlds first Region throws [...] His flight precipitant, and windes with ease [...] Through the pure marble Air his oblique way [...] Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon [...] Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds, [...] Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles, [...] Like those Hesperian Gardens fam'd of old, [...] Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales, [...] Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there [...] 570 [...] He stayd not to enquire: above them all [...] The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven [...] Allur'd his eye: Thither his course he bends [...] Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe [...] By center, or eccentric, hard to tell, [...] Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie [...] Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick, [...] That from his Lordly eye keep distance due, [...] Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move [...] Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute [...] 580 [...] Days, months, and years, towards his all-chearing Lamp [...] Turn swift their various motions, or are turnd [...] By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms [...] The Univers, and to each inward part [...] With gentle penetration, though unseen, [...] Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep: [...] So wondrously was set his Station bright. [...] There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps [...] Astronomer in the Sun's lucent Orbe [...] Through his glaz'd Optic Tube yet never saw. [...] 590 [...] The place he found beyond expression bright, [...] Compar'd with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone; [...] Not all parts like, but all alike informd [...] Which radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire; [...] If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer; [...] If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite, [...] Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon [...] In Aarons Brest-plate, and a stone besides [...] Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen, [...] That stone, or like to that which here below [...] 600 [...] Philosophers in vain so long have sought, [...] In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde [...] Volatil Hermes, and call up unbound [...] In various shapes old Proteus from the Sea, [...] Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme. [...] What wonder then if fields and regions here [...] Breathe forth Elixir pure, and Rivers run [...] Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch [...] Th' Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote [...] Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt [...] 610 [...] Here in the dark so many precious things [...] Of colour glorious and effect so rare? [...] Here matter new to gaze the Devil met [...] Undazl'd, farr and wide his eye commands, [...] For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, [...] But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon [...] Culminate from th' Aequator, as they now [...] Shot upward still direct, whence no way round [...] Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire, [...] No where so cleer, sharp'nd his visual ray [...] 620 [...] To objects distant farr, whereby he soon [...] Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand, [...] The same whom John saw also in the Sun: [...] His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid; [...] Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar [...] Circl'd his Head, nor less his Locks behind [...] Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings [...] Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy'd [...] Hee seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep. [...] Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope [...] 630 [...] To find who might direct his wandring flight [...] To Paradise the happie seat of Man, [...] His journies end and our beginning woe. [...] But first he casts to change his proper shape, [...] Which else might work him danger or delay: [...] And now a stripling Cherube he appeers, [...] Not of the prime, yet such as in his face [...] Youth smil'd Celestial, and to every Limb [...] Sutable grace diffus'd, so well he feignd; [...] Under a Coronet his flowing haire [...] 640 [...] In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore [...] Of many a colourd plume sprinkl'd with Gold, [...] His habit fit for speed succinct, and held [...] Before his decent steps a Silver wand. [...] He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright, [...] Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd, [...] Admonisht by his eare, and strait was known [...] Th' Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seav'n [...] Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne [...] Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes [...] 650 [...] That run through all the Heav'ns, or down to th' Earth [...] Bear his swift errands over moist and dry, [...] O're Sea and Land: him Satan thus accostes; [...] Uriel, for thou of those seav'n Spirits that stand [...] In sight of God's high Throne, gloriously bright, [...] The first art wont his great authentic will [...] Interpreter through highest Heav'n to bring, [...] Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend; [...] And here art likeliest by supream decree [...] Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye [...] 660 [...] To visit oft this new Creation round; [...] Unspeakable desire to see, and know [...] All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man, [...] His chief delight and favour, him for whom [...] All these his works so wondrous he ordaind, [...] Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim [...] Alone thus wandring. Brightest Seraph tell [...] In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man [...] His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none, [...] But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell; [...] 670 [...] That I may find him, and with secret gaze, [...] Or open admiration him behold [...] On whom the great Creator hath bestowd [...] Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd; [...] That both in him and all things, as is meet, [...] The Universal Maker we may praise; [...] Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes [...] To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss [...] Created this new happie Race of Men [...] To serve him better: wise are all his wayes. [...] 680 [...] So spake the false dissembler unperceivd; [...] For neither Man nor Angel can discern [...] Hypocrisie, the only evil that walks [...] Invisible, except to God alone, [...] By his permissive will, through Heav'n and Earth: [...] And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps [...] At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie [...] Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill [...] Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil'd [...] Uriel, though Regent of the Sun, and held [...] 690 [...] The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav'n; [...] Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule [...] In his uprightness answer thus returnd. [...] Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to know [...] The works of God, thereby to glorifie [...] The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess [...] That reaches blame, but rather merits praise [...] The more it seems excess, that led thee hither [...] From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone, [...] To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps [...] 700 [...] Contented with report heare onely in heav'n: [...] For wonderful indeed are all his works, [...] Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all [...] Had in remembrance alwayes with delight; [...] But what created mind can comprehend [...] Thir number, or the wisdom infinite [...] That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep. [...] I saw when at his Word the formless Mass, [...] This worlds material mould, came to a heap: [...] Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar [...] 710 [...] Stood rul'd, stood vast infinitude confin'd; [...] Till at his second bidding darkness fled, [...] Light shon, and order from disorder sprung: [...] Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then [...] The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire, [...] And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav'n [...] Flew upward, spirited with various forms, [...] That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs [...] Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; [...] Each had his place appointed, each his course, [...] 720 [...] The rest in circuit walles this Universe. [...] Look downward on that Globe whose hither side [...] With light from hence, though but reflected, shines; [...] That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light [...] His day, which else as th' other Hemisphere [...] Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon [...] (So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide [...] Timely interposes, and her monthly round [...] Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav'n; [...] With borrowd light her countenance triform [...] 730 [...] Hence fills and empties to enlighten th' Earth, [...] And in her pale dominion checks the night. [...] That spot to which I point is Paradise, [...] Adams abode, those loftie shades his Bowre. [...] Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires. [...] Thus said, he turnd, and Satan bowing low, [...] As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven, [...] Where honour due and reverence none neglects, [...] Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath, [...] Down from th' Ecliptic, sped with hop'd success, [...] 740 [...] Throws his steep flight with many an Aerie wheele, [...] Nor staid, till on Niphates top he lights.|$|E

[...] He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh, [...] Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man [...] Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes [...] 240 [...] A militarie Vest of purple flowd [...] Livelier then Meliboean, or the graine [...] Of Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero's old [...] In time of Truce; Iris had dipt the wooff; [...] His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime [...] In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side [...] As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword, [...] Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear. [...] Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State [...] Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd. [...] 250 [...] Adam, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs: [...] Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death, [...] Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress, [...] Defeated of his seisure many dayes [...] Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent, [...] And one bad act with many deeds well done [...] Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd [...] Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes; [...] But longer in this Paradise to dwell [...] Permits not; to remove thee I am come, [...] 260 [...] And send thee from the Garden forth to till [...] The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile. [...] He added not, for Adam at the newes [...] Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, [...] That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen [...] Yet all had heard, with audible lament [...] Discover'd soon the place of her retire. [...] O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death! [...] Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave [...] Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades, [...] 270 [...] Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend, [...] Quiet though sad, the respit of that day [...] That must be mortal to us both. O flours, [...] That never will in other Climate grow, [...] My early visitation, and my last [...] At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand [...] From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names, [...] Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke [...] Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount? [...] Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd [...] 280 [...] With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee [...] How shall I part, and whither wander down [...] Into a lower World, to this obscure [...] And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire [...] Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits? [...] Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde. [...] Lament not Eve, but patiently resigne [...] What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart, [...] Thus over fond, on that which is not thine; [...] Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes [...] 290 [...] Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound; [...] Where he abides, think there thy native soile.

[...] Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd [...] Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem [...] Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould [...] Thy message, which might else in telling wound, [...] And in performing end us; what besides [...] 300 [...] Of sorrow and dejection and despair [...] Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring, [...] Departure from this happy place, our sweet [...] Recess, and onely consolation left [...] Familiar to our eyes, all places else [...] Inhospitable appeer and desolate, [...] Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer [...] Incessant I could hope to change the will [...] Of him who all things can, I would not cease [...] To wearie him with my assiduous cries: [...] 310 [...] But prayer against his <b>absolute</b> <b>Decree</b> [...] No more availes then breath against the winde, [...] Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth: [...] Therefore to his great bidding I submit. [...] This most afflicts me, that departing hence, [...] As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd [...] His blessed count'nance; here I could frequent, [...] With worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd [...] Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate; [...] On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree [...] 320 [...] Stood visible, among these Pines his voice [...] I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd: [...] So many grateful Altars I would reare [...] Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone [...] Of lustre from the brook, in memorie, [...] Or monument to Ages, and thereon [...] Offer sweet smelling Gumms & Fruits and Flours: [...] In yonder nether World where shall I seek [...] His bright appearances, or footstep trace? [...] For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd [...] 330 [...] To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now [...] Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts [...] Of glory, and farr off his steps adore. [...] To whom thus Michael with regard benigne. [...] Adam, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth [...] Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills [...] Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives, [...] Fomented by his virtual power and warmd: [...] All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule, [...] No despicable gift; surmise not then [...] 340 [...] His presence to these narrow bounds confin'd [...] Of Paradise or Eden: this had been [...] Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred [...] All generations, and had hither come [...] From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate [...] And reverence thee thir great Progenitor. [...] But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down [...] To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons: [...] Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine [...] God is as here, and will be found alike [...] 350 [...] Present, and of his presence many a signe [...] Still following thee, still compassing thee round [...] With goodness and paternal Love, his Face [...] Express, and of his steps the track Divine. [...] Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd, [...] Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent [...] To shew thee what shall come in future dayes [...] To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad [...] Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending [...] With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn [...] 360 [...] True patience, and to temper joy with fear [...] And pious sorrow, equally enur'd [...] By moderation either state to beare, [...] Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead [...] Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure [...] Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend [...] This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes) [...] Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st, [...] As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd. [...] To whom thus Adam gratefully repli'd. [...] 370 [...] Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path [...] Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit, [...] However chast'ning, to the evil turne [...] My obvious breast, arming to overcom [...] By suffering, and earne rest from labour won, [...] If so I may attain. So both ascend [...] In the Visions of God: It was a Hill [...] Of Paradise the highest, from whose top [...] The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken [...] Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay. [...] 380 [...] Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round, [...] Whereon for different cause the Tempter set [...] Our second Adam in the Wilderness, [...] To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory. [...] His Eye might there command wherever stood [...] City of old or modern Fame, the Seat [...] Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls [...] Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can [...] And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne, [...] To Paquin of Sinaean Kings, and thence [...] 390 [...] To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul [...] Down to the golden Chersonese, or where [...] The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since [...] In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar [...] In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance, [...] Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken [...] Th' Empire of Negus to his utmost Port [...] Ercoco and the less Maritine Kings [...] Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind, [...] And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme [...] 400 [...] Of Congo, and Angola fardest South; [...] Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount [...] The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez, and Sus, [...] Marocco and Algiers, and Tremisen; [...] On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway [...] The World: in Spirit perhaps he also saw [...] Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume, [...] And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat [...] Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoil'd [...] Guiana, whose great Citie Geryons Sons [...] 410 [...] Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights [...] Michael from Adams eyes the Filme remov'd [...] Which that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight [...] Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue [...] The visual Nerve, for he had much to see; [...] And from the Well of Life three drops instill'd. [...] So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd, [...] Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight, [...] That Adam now enforc't to close his eyes, [...] Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst: [...] 420 [...] But him the gentle Angel by the hand [...] Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd. [...] Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold [...] Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought [...] In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd [...] Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd, [...] Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive [...] Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds. [...] His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field, [...] Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves [...] 430 [...] New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds; [...] Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood [...] Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon [...] A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought [...] First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf, [...] Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next [...] More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock [...] Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid [...] The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd, [...] On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd. [...] 440 [...] His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n [...] Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame; [...] The others not, for his was not sincere; [...] Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd, [...] Smote him into the Midriff with a stone [...] That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale [...] Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd. [...] Much at that sight was Adam in his heart [...] Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd. [...] O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n [...] 450 [...] To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd; [...] Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid? [...] T' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd. [...] These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come [...] Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain, [...] For envie that his Brothers Offering found [...] From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact [...] Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd [...] Loose no reward, though here thou see him die, [...] Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire. [...] 460 [...] Alas, both for the deed and for the cause! [...] But have I now seen Death? Is this the way [...] I must return to native dust? O sight [...] Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, [...] Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! [...] To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen [...] In his first shape on man; but many shapes [...] Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead [...] To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense [...] More terrible at th' entrance then within. [...] 470 [...] Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die, [...] By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more [...] In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring [...] Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew [...] Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know [...] What miserie th' inabstinence of Eve [...] Shall bring on men. Immediately a place [...] Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark, [...] A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid [...] Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies [...] 480 [...] Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes [...] Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds, [...] Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs, [...] Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs, [...] Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums. [...] Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair [...] Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch; [...] And over them triumphant Death his Dart [...] Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't [...] With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. [...] 490 [...] Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long [...] Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept, [...] Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd [...] His best of Man, and gave him up to tears [...] A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, [...] And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd. [...] O miserable Mankind, to what fall [...] Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd? [...] Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n [...] To be thus wrested from us? rather why [...] 500 [...] Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew [...] What we receive, would either not accept [...] Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down, [...] Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus [...] Th' Image of God in man created once [...] So goodly and erect, though faultie since, [...] To such unsightly sufferings be debas't [...] Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man, [...] Retaining still Divine similitude [...] In part, from such deformities be free, [...] 510 [...] And for his Makers Image sake exempt? [...] Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then [...] Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd [...] To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took [...] His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice, [...] Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. [...] Therefore so abject is thir punishment, [...] Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, [...] Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't [...] While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules [...] 520 [...] To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they [...] Gods Image did not reverence in themselves. [...] I yeild it just, said Adam, and submit. [...] But is there yet no other way, besides [...] These painful passages, how we may come [...] To Death, and mix with our connatural dust? [...] There is, said Michael, if thou well observe [...] The rule of not too much, by temperance taught [...] In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence [...] Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, [...] 530 [...] Till many years over thy head return: [...] So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop [...] Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease [...] Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature: [...] This is old age; but then thou must outlive [...] Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change [...] To witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then [...] Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe, [...] To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth [...] Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne [...] 540 [...] A melancholly damp of cold and dry [...] To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume [...] The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor. [...] Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong [...] Life much, bent rather how I may be quit [...] Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge, [...] Which I must keep till my appointed day [...] Of rendring up, Michael to him repli'd. [...] Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst [...] Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n: [...] 550 [...] And now prepare thee for another sight. [...] He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon [...] Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds [...] Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound [...] Of Instruments that made melodious chime [...] Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd [...] Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch [...] Instinct through all proportions low and high [...] Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue. [...] In other part stood one who at the Forge [...] 560 [...] Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass [...] Had melted (whether found where casual fire [...] Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale, [...] Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot [...] To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream [...] From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind [...] Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd [...] First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought [...] Fulfil or grav'n in mettle. After these, [...] But on the hether side a different sort [...] 570 [...] From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat, [...] Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise [...] Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent [...] To worship God aright, and know his works [...] Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve [...] Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain [...] Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold [...] A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay [...] In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung [...] Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on: [...] 580 [...] The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes [...] Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net [...] Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose; [...] And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star [...] Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat [...] They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke [...] Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't; [...] With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound. [...] Such happy interview and fair event [...] Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, [...] 590 [...] And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart [...] Of Adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight, [...] The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd. [...] True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, [...] Much better seems this Vision, and more hope [...] Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; [...] Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, [...] Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. [...] To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best [...] By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, [...] 600 [...] Created, as thou art, to nobler end [...] Holie and pure, conformitie divine. [...] Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents [...] Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race [...] Who slew his Brother; studious they appere [...] Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare, [...] Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit [...] Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none. [...] Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; [...] For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd [...] 610 [...] Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, [...] Yet empty of all good wherein consists [...] Womans domestic honour and chief praise; [...] Bred onely and completed to the taste [...] Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance, [...] To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. [...] To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives [...] Religious titl'd them the Sons of God, [...] Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame [...] Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles [...] 620 [...] Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, [...] (Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which [...] The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. [...] To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft. [...] O pittie and shame, that they who to live well [...] Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread [...] Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! [...] But still I see the tenor of Mans woe [...] Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. [...] From Mans effeminate slackness it begins, [...] 630 [...] Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place [...] By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd. [...] But now prepare thee for another Scene. [...] He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred [...] Before him, Towns, and rural works between, [...] Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs, [...] Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr, [...] Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise; [...] Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed, [...] Single or in Array of Battel rang'd [...] 640 [...] Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood; [...] One way a Band select from forage drives [...] A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine [...] From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock, [...] Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine, [...] Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye, [...] But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray; [...] With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine; [...] Where Cattel pastur'd late, now scatterd lies [...] With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field [...] 650 [...] Deserted: Others to a Citie strong [...] Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine, [...] Assaulting; others from the Wall defend [...] With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire; [...] On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. [...] In other part the scepter'd Haralds call [...] To Council in the Citie Gates: anon [...] Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt, [...] Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon [...] In factious opposition, till at last [...] 660 [...] Of middle Age one rising, eminent [...] In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong, [...] Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace, [...] And Judgement from above: him old and young [...] Exploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands, [...] Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence [...] Unseen amid the throng: so violence [...] Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law [...] Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found. [...] Adam was all in tears, and to his guide [...] 670 [...] Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these, [...] Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death [...] Inhumanly to men, and multiply [...] Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew [...] His Brother; for of whom such massacher [...] Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men? [...] But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n [...] Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost? [...] To whom thus Michael; These are the product [...] Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st; [...] 680 [...] Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves [...] Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt, [...] Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind. [...] Such were these Giants, men of high renown; [...] For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd, [...] And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd; [...] To overcome in Battel, and subdue [...] Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite [...] Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch [...] Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done [...] 690 [...] Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours, [...] Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods, [...] Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men. [...] Thus Fame shall be achiev'd, renown on Earth, [...] And what most merits fame in silence hid. [...] But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst [...] The onely righteous in a World perverse, [...] And therefore hated, therefore so beset [...] With Foes for daring single to be just, [...] And utter odious Truth, that God would come [...] 700 [...] To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High [...] Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds [...] Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God [...] High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss, [...] Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward [...] Awaits the good, the rest what punishment; [...] Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. [...] He look'd, & saw the face of things quite chang'd; [...] The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar, [...] All now was turn'd to jollitie and game, [...] 710 [...] To luxurie and riot, feast and dance, [...] Marrying or prostituting, as befell, [...] Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire [...] Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles. [...] At length a Reverend Sire among them came, [...] And of thir doings great dislike declar'd, [...] And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft [...] Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met, [...] Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd [...] Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls [...] 720 [...] In prison under Judgements imminent: [...] But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd [...] Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off; [...] Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall, [...] Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk, [...] Measur'd by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth, [...] Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore [...] Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large [...] For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange! [...] Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small [...] 730 [...] Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught [...] Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons [...] With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore. [...] Meanwhile the Southwind rose, & with black wings [...] Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove [...] From under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie [...] Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist, [...] Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie [...] Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain [...] Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth [...] 740 [...] No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum [...] Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow [...] Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else [...] Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp [...] Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea, [...] Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces [...] Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd [...] And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late, [...] All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't. [...] How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold [...] 750 [...] The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad, [...] Depopulation; thee another Floud, [...] Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd, [...] And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard [...] By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last, [...] Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns [...] His Childern, all in view destroyd at once; [...] And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint. [...] O Visions ill foreseen! better had I [...] Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne [...] 760 [...] My part of evil onely, each dayes lot [...] Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst [...] The burd'n of many Ages, on me light [...] At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth [...] Abortive, to torment me ere thir being, [...] With thought that they must be. Let no man seek [...] Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall [...] Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure, [...] Which neither his foreknowing can prevent, [...] And hee the future evil shall no less [...] 770 [...] In apprehension then in substance feel [...] Grievous to bear: but that care now is past, [...] Man is not whom to warne: those few escap't [...] Famin and anguish will at last consume [...] Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope [...] When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth, [...] All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd [...] With length of happy days the race of man; [...] But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see [...] Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste. [...] 780 [...] How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide, [...] And whether here the Race of man will end. [...] To whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou sawst [...] In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they [...] First seen in acts of prowess eminent [...] And great exploits, but of true vertu void; [...] Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste [...] Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby [...] Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey, [...] Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, [...] 790 [...] Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride [...] Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace. [...] The conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr [...] Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose [...] And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd [...] In sharp contest of Battel found no aide [...] Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale [...] Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, [...] Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords [...] Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear [...] 800 [...] More then anough, that temperance may be tri'd: [...] So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd, [...] Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot; [...] One Man except, the onely Son of light [...] In a dark Age, against example good, [...] Against allurement, custom, and a World [...] Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn, [...] Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes [...] Shall them admonish, and before them set [...] The paths of righteousness, how much more safe, [...] 810 [...] And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come [...] On thir impenitence; and shall returne [...] Of them derided, but of God observd [...] The one just Man alive; by his command [...] Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst, [...] To save himself and houshold from amidst [...] A World devote to universal rack. [...] No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast [...] Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd, [...] And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts [...] 820 [...] Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre [...] Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep [...] Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp [...] Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise [...] Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount [...] Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd [...] Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud, [...] With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift [...] Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf, [...] And there take root an Iland salt and bare, [...] 830 [...] The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang. [...] To teach thee that God attributes to place [...] No sanctitie, if none be thither brought [...] By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell. [...] And now what further shall ensue, behold. [...] He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud, [...] Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled, [...] Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie [...] Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd; [...] And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass [...] 840 [...] Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew, [...] As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink [...] From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole [...] With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt [...] His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut. [...] The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground [...] Fast {{on the top of}} som high mountain fixt. [...] And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer; [...] With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive [...] Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde. [...] 850 [...] Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies, [...] And after him, the surer messenger, [...] A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie [...] Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light; [...] The second time returning, in his Bill [...] An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe: [...] Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke [...] The ancient Sire descends with all his Train; [...] Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout, [...] Grateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds [...] 860 [...] A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow [...] Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay, [...] Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new. [...] Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad [...] Greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth. [...] O thou that future things canst represent [...] As present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive [...] At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live [...] With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve. [...] Farr less I now lament for one whole World [...] 870 [...] Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce [...] For one Man found so perfet and so just, [...] That God voutsafes to raise another World [...] From him, and all his anger to forget. [...] But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn, [...] Distended as the Brow of God appeas'd, [...] Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde [...] The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud, [...] Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth? [...] To whom th' Archangel. Dextrously thou aim'st; [...] 880 [...] So willingly doth God remit his Ire, [...] Though late repenting him of Man deprav'd, [...] Griev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw [...] The whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh [...] Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd, [...] Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight, [...] That he relents, not to blot out mankind, [...] And makes a Covenant never to destroy [...] The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea [...] Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World [...] 890 [...] With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings [...] Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set [...] His triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to look [...] And call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night, [...] Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost [...] Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new, [...] Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.|$|E
50|$|Barth's {{doctrine}} of election involves a firm rejection {{of the notion of}} an eternal, hidden decree. In keeping with his Christo-centric methodology, Barth argues that to ascribe the salvation or damnation of humanity to an abstract <b>absolute</b> <b>decree</b> is to make some part of God more final and definitive than God's saving act in Jesus Christ. God's <b>absolute</b> <b>decree,</b> if one may speak of such a thing, is God's gracious decision to be for humanity in the person of Jesus Christ. Drawing from the earlier Reformed tradition, Barth retains the notion of double predestination but makes Jesus himself the object of both divine election and reprobation simultaneously; Jesus embodies both God's election of humanity and God's rejection of human sin. While some regard this revision of the {{doctrine of}} election as an improvement on the Augustinian-Calvinist doctrine of the predestination of individuals, critics, namely Brunner, have charged that Barth's view amounts to a soft universalism, thereby departing from Augustinian-Calvinism.|$|E

5000|$|Another Latin {{manuscript}} by Overall, on the [...] "five points" [...] at dispute at the Synod of Dort, {{appeared in}} translation by John Plaifere (1651 in his Appello Evangelium) and in 1850 (in William Goode, The Doctrine of the Church of England {{as to the}} effects of Baptism in the case of Infants). It was cited in Joseph Hall's Via Media and Davenant's Animadversions upon a Treatise lately published by S. Hoard, and entitled [...] "God's Love to mankind, manifested in disproving his <b>absolute</b> <b>decree</b> for their damnation" [...] (1641).|$|E
5000|$|The {{paradoxical}} finding left doubts {{hanging over}} Dilke's respectability, and investigative journalist William Thomas Stead launched a public campaign against him. Two months later, in April, Dilke sought {{to reopen the}} case and clear his name by making the Queen's Proctor {{a party to the}} case and opposing the <b>decree</b> <b>absolute.</b> Unfortunately, Dilke and his legal team had badly miscalculated (his legal advice has been described as [...] "perhaps the worst professional advice ever given"). Though they had planned to subject Virginia to a searching cross-examination, Dilke, having been dismissed from the case, had no locus standi. As a consequence, it was Dilke who was subjected to severe scrutiny in the witness box by Henry Matthews. Matthews' attack was devastating, and Dilke proved an unconvincing witness. His habit of physically cutting pieces out of his diary with scissors was held up to particular ridicule, as it created the impression that he had cut out evidence of potentially embarrassing appointments. The jury found that Virginia had presented the true version of the facts and that the <b>decree</b> <b>absolute</b> should be granted.|$|R
5|$|Edward left Britain for Austria, {{where he}} stayed at Schloss Enzesfeld, {{the home of}} Baron Eugen and Baroness Kitty de Rothschild. Edward had to remain apart from Wallis until there was no danger of compromising the {{granting}} of a <b>decree</b> <b>absolute</b> in her divorce proceedings. Upon her divorce being made final in May 1937, she changed her name by deed poll to Wallis Warfield, resuming her maiden name. The couple were reunited at the Château de Candé, Monts, France, on 4 May 1937.|$|R

60|$|Oh how men {{hate that}} message!--the {{message that the}} true wrath of God, necessary, inevitable, is {{revealed}} from heaven against all unrighteousness of men. How they writhe under it! How they shut their ears to it, and cry to their preachers, 'No! Tell us of any wrath of God but that! Tell us rather of the torments of the damned, of a frowning God, of <b>absolute</b> <b>decrees</b> to destruction, of the reprobation of millions before they are born; any doctrine, however fearful and horrible: because we don't quite believe it, but only think {{that we ought to}} believe it. Yes, tell us anything rather than that news, which cuts at the root of all our pride, of all our comfort, and all our superstition--the news that we cannot escape the consequences of our own actions; that there are no back stairs up which we may be smuggled into heaven; that as we sow, so we shall reap; that we are filled with the fruits of our own devices; every man his own poisoner, every man his own executioner, every man his own suicide; that hell begins in this life, and death begins before we die: --do not say that: because we cannot help believing it; for our own consciousness and our own experience tell us it is true.' No wonder that the preacher who tells men that is hated, is called a Rationalist, a Pantheist, a heretic, and what not, just because he does set forth such a living God, such a justice of God, such a wrath of God as would make the sinner tremble, if he believed in it, not merely once in a way, when he hears a stirring sermon about the endless torments: but all day long, going out and coming in, lying on his bed and walking by the way, always haunted by the shadow of himself, knowing that he is bearing about in him the perpetually growing death of sin.|$|R
25|$|Within the United Kingdom, in England and Wales, the Divorce (Religious Marriages) Act 2002, {{relates to}} Jewish divorce. The Act allows a Court {{discretionary}} right to award any damages under Tort remedies, impose any civil or criminal fines or other penalties, or to grant any further relief, and withhold the final legal civil dissolution {{of a marriage}} of Jews or of other person by means of granting the <b>decree</b> <b>absolute</b> until a declaration made by both parties that they have taken such steps as are required to dissolve the marriage in accordance with rabbinical law.|$|R
50|$|Newton instituted divorce {{proceedings}} {{and sent her}} back to England. The captain paid for her passage, the deal being that in return she would become his mistress. She became pregnant but refused to marry Palliser. Her daughter, Muriel Violet Mary Newton, was born in Yorkshire on 20 December 1871 {{on the same day}} that her decree nisi came through. The <b>decree</b> <b>absolute</b> for her divorce was granted 20 July 1872. Kate and Violet went to live with Kate's married sister Polly's family at Hill Road, St John's Wood.|$|R
5000|$|A {{decree nisi}} or rule nisi (...) is {{a court order}} {{that does not have}} any force unless a {{particular}} condition is met. Once the condition is met, the ruling becomes a <b>decree</b> <b>absolute</b> (rule absolute), and is binding. Typically, the condition is that an adversely affected party fail to provide satisfactory evidence or argument that the decree should not take effect (i.e. the decree takes effect unless the party shows that it should not). [...] For that reason, a decree nisi may also be called a rule, order or decree to show cause.|$|R
50|$|Foreclosure {{is rarely}} {{exercised}} as a remedy. To execute foreclosure, the secured party needs to petition the court, {{and the order}} is made in two stages (nisi and absolute), making the process slow and cumbersome. Courts are historically reluctant to grant orders for foreclosure, and will often instead order a judicial sale. If the asset {{is worth more than}} the secured obligations, the secured party will normally have to account for the surplus. Even if a court makes a <b>decree</b> <b>absolute</b> and orders foreclosure, the court retains an absolute discretion to reopen the foreclosure after the making of the order, although this would not affect the title of any third party purchaser.|$|R

This fiction gave her [...] "entrée to polite circles as a governess" [...] and, in 1880, she married Alexander Frater, the son of her employers. They soon moved to the Coonamble district, and had two sons and a daughter. However, Alexander Frater ran off with her niece, Sarah Glover, in 1887, and Barbara moved to Sydney and commenced divorce proceedings. A <b>decree</b> <b>absolute</b> was granted 4 March 1890.|$|R
