60|$|A danseuse {{from the}} opera {{is on her}} way to Paris. Followed by her bonne and her little dog, she paces the deck, {{stepping}} out, in the real dancer fashion, and ogling all around. How happy the two young Englishmen are, who can speak French, and make up to her: and how all criticise her points and paces! Yonder is a group of young ladies, who <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> to learn how to be governesses: those two splendidly dressed ladies are milliners from the Rue Richelieu, who have just brought over, and disposed of, their cargo of Summer fashions. Here sits the Rev. Mr. Snodgrass with his pupils, whom he is conducting to his establishment, near Boulogne, where, in addition to a classical and mathematical education (washing included), the young gentlemen have the benefit of learning French among THE FRENCH THEMSELVES. Accordingly, the young gentlemen are locked up in a great rickety house, two miles from Boulogne and never see a soul, except the French usher and the cook.|$|E
50|$|Nina and Jesus have an {{informal}} elopement during the night. After Nina returns home {{to tell her}} mother gleefully, Grace passes away in Richard's arms. Anna leaves Danny's apartment to tell her mother about her relationship with Danny {{only to find that}} she has died. At Grace's funeral, Anna says she already told Eric about their affair. Danny tells Anna he is leaving {{in a couple of days}} and says goodbye. That night, Eric announces he and Anna <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> to get married. The next day, Nina tells Anna that she loves Danny, not Eric, and advises her to go after Danny.|$|E
25|$|Mary {{remained}} in England {{for most of}} her childhood, until she was sent abroad in 1514 around the age of fifteen when her father secured her a place as maid-of-honour to the King's sister, Princess Mary, who <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>to</b> marry King LouisXII of France.|$|R

50|$|Kline {{stated that}} she would <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> in June 2011 to shoot her Vogue Italia spread and moved to New York City with fellow contestant, and runner-up, Molly O'Connell in July 2011.|$|R
50|$|Back at the plant, Carl makes Homer his new {{executive}} assistant. That evening, Marge's libido {{pumped up}} by the male population's positive feedback on her calendar is running high, but Homer is too overworked and exhausted to satisfy her. This becomes an unhappy trend, and Marge feels ignored. Homer tries {{to make up for}} it by taking Marge out to a hotel. During their attempt to have a romantic night together, Homer receives a phone call from Carl who tells him they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> on a business trip. When Homer leaves the Simpsons' house the next morning, a frustrated Marge throws a mallet after his retreating taxicab, and she accidentally knocks out neighbor Ned Flanders instead and invites him and his children over for a family dinner by way of apology.|$|E
5000|$|Later that night, Danny starts packing {{his things}} in a milk crate. Loud music catches his attention, and he discovers Flip dead {{in front of the}} TV. A pair of cops declare Flip a [...] "typical bloody junkie" [...] and cover his body with a sheet, telling Danny not to touch anything. As the sun rises, Danny leaves with his {{typewriter}}, catches a ferry, and drops his typewriter into Sydney Harbour. Later, Sam encounters Danny asleep in front of her door, who, after waking him up, tells her that Flip has died. Danny and all of his former roommates hold a memorial service for flip. Each leaves a memento on a charcoal fire in a kettle grill in which Flip's ashes have been dumped. Danny sacrifices his old boombox. Anya gives Danny a cheque, ostensibly from Penthouse, and Nina declares that she and Anya, now a couple, <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> together, where Nina hopes be a successful actor. Danny calls Sgt. O'Neill and identifies the now-deceased Flip as Robert J. Corcoran, and he and Sam set off down the street together.|$|E
40|$|The {{city and}} the urban condition, popular {{subjects}} of art, literature, and film, have been commonly represented as fragmented, isolating, violent, with silent crowds moving through {{the hustle and bustle}} of a noisy, polluted cityspace. Included in this diverse artistic field is children’s literature—an area of creative and critical inquiry that continues to {{play a central role in}} illuminating and shaping perceptions of the city, of city lifestyles, and of the people who traverse the urban landscape. Fiction’s textual representations of cities, its sites and sights, lifestyles and characters have drawn on traditions of realist, satirical, and fantastic writing to produce the protean urban story—utopian, dystopian, visionary, satirical—with the goal of offering an account or critique of the contemporary {{city and the}} urban condition. In writing about cities and urban life, children’s literature variously locates the child in relation to the social (urban) space. This dialogic relation between subject and social space has been at the heart of writings about/of the flâneur: a figure who experiences modes of being in the city as it transforms under the influences of modernism and postmodernism. Within this context of a changing urban ontology brought about by (post) modern styles and practices, this article examines five contemporary picture books: The Cows <b>Are</b> <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> by David Kirby and Allen Woodman; Ooh-la-la (Max in love) by Maira Kalman; Mr Chicken Goes to Paris and Old Tom’s Holiday by Leigh Hobbs; and The Empty City by David Megarrity. I investigate the possibility of these texts reviving the act of flânerie, but in a way that enables different modes of being a flâneur, a neo-flâneur. I suggest that the neo-flâneur retains some of the characteristics of the original flâneur, but incorporates others that take account of the changes wrought by postmodernity and globalization, particularly tourism and consumption. The dual issue at the heart of the discussion is that tourism and consumption as agents of cultural globalization offer a different way of thinking about the phenomenon of flânerie. While the flâneur can be regarded as the precursor to the tourist, the discussion considers how different modes of flânerie, such as the tourist-flâneur, are an inevitable outcome of commodification of the activities that accompany strolling through the (post) modern urban space. ...|$|E
60|$|We soon got {{acquaintance}} with these gentlemen, who <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris,</b> {{as well as}} we; so {{the next day we}} made up our company with them, and were a pretty troop of five gentlemen and four servants.|$|R

50|$|Anna {{was tired}} of {{covering}} for David. She discovered he and Erica Kane could {{have been responsible for}} the death of Michael Cambias. She went to the cabin and left the evidence she had found and a note for David. David came before she could leave. She told him she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with Robin and she did not want him to follow her. She walked out the door and out of Pine Valley.|$|R
60|$|I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> on Sunday {{morning for}} ten days or so. I purpose being back again within a fortnight. If you will let me think of this matter in the meanwhile, I shall at least have done all I can to satisfy my own {{appreciation}} of your work.|$|R
6000|$|... "In no {{case will}} the Binet Troupe {{interest}} me much longer," [...] said she. [...] "I shall <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> soon.

50|$|The {{original}} {{ending of}} the film involved Sam successfully rescuing Barbara, and arresting Flamand, Nathalie, Moser, and Ingrid, with Terry <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>to</b> pick them up. Jess Franco wanted a slightly different touch to make it different, so while switching the ending around, this time it is mentioned that Terry Hallen <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>to</b> the clinic, but it is left open, if he gets there in time to save them or not.|$|R
50|$|Jade <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> {{with her}} grandmother. She meets a boy - Flynn Jackson - {{in the train}} to Brighton. They become friends.

She sends text messages, which are {{supposed}} to be from Tansy.|$|R
60|$|This angel {{is without}} a place; {{and for this}} reason (besides the {{pleasure}} of composing the above slap at episcopacy)--I have indited her history. If the Bishop <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris,</b> and wants a good honest maid-of-all-work, he can have her, I have no doubt; or if he chooses to give a few pounds to her mother, they can be sent to Mr. Titmarsh, at the publisher's.|$|R
60|$|The omnibus which Mr. George and Rollo {{had entered}} {{contained}} several other passengers, {{some of whom}} had carpet bags and valises with them, as if they, too, <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris.</b> Besides the driver, there was a conductor, whose place was upon the step of the omnibus, behind. The conductor opened and shut the doors for the passengers when they wished to get in or out, and took the fare.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Fred, Daphne and Velma are on {{vacation}} in Paris. However, Scooby-Doo and Shaggy have not arrived yet, and the gang wonders where they are.

LaFleur wants to find and kill the Snowman, and is taking Shaggy and Scooby along as bait. LaFleur then locks Shaggy and Scooby up with his equipment, and throws them off the plane. Shaggy, realizing they <b>are</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris,</b> manages <b>to</b> get a quick phone call through to Fred before the phone goes dead. Fred uses the GPS on his phone to track them, and then he, Daphne and Velma, head to the Himalayas to find them.|$|R

5000|$|When {{a worried}} Frederick Muller tries to contact his brother, the trail leads to Bartok. The scar convinces Frederick {{that the man}} he sees is merely a lookalike.

[...] "They had luggage, but I {{explained}} that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris,</b> she <b>was</b> coming back by train. At two o'clock we were rung up on the telephone. Their brake had snapped going down the hill by St. Entuiel, and the chauffeur--he is mad now--but they think he lost his nerve. They were dashed into a tree, and--they were both dead--when they were got out from the wreck." ...|$|R

However, the photographer cannot put across what he has photographed. Waking up in the house at sunrise, he goes back to the park alone and finds that the body is gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{woman does}} not count the risks, {{when she has}} lost, through treachery, the man she cares for," [...] she said quietly. [...] "But for this, I should have been neutral.

Despite the suffering she has endured at her boss's behest, she attempts to warn Miranda.|$|R
60|$|We {{have had}} the kindest of letters from dear noble Mr. Kenyon; who, by the way, speaks of you as we like to hear him. Dickens <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> for the winter, and Mrs. Butler[151] (he adds) is {{expected}} in London. Dear Mr. Kenyon calls me 'crotchety,' but Robert 'an incarnation of {{the good and the}} true,' so that I have everything to thank him for. There are noble people who take the world's side and make it seem 'for the nonce' almost respectable; but he gives up all the talk and fine schemes about money-making, and allows us to wait to see whether we want it or not--the money, I mean.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{they are}} all there. I went out and gave cakes to the dogs and sugar to the horses every day, and talked to them, and I think {{regularly}} had a cry over them. It was very foolish, but I could not help it. It did all seem so wrong and so pitiful. I could not learn much about you from father. He said that you had only written once to him on business since things were finally settled; but that you had mentioned that you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris,</b> and he said, too--" [...] and she hesitated for a moment, [...] "that although you had lost Fairclose and all the property, you had enough to live upon in a way--a very poor way--but still enough for that." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, I tread upon French ground, and am {{greeted by}} the three charming words, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, painted up (in letters a little too thin for their height) on the Custom-house wall - also {{by the sight of}} large cocked hats, without which demonstrative head-gear nothing of a public nature can be done upon this soil. All the rabid Hotel {{population}} of Boulogne howl and shriek outside a distant barrier, frantic to get at us. Demented, by some unlucky means peculiar to himself, is delivered over to their fury, and is presently seen struggling in a whirlpool of Touters - is somehow understood <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> - <b>is,</b> with infinite noise, rescued by two cocked hats, and brought into Custom-house bondage with the rest of us.|$|R
60|$|In {{obedience}} to this intimation, Rollo and Jane took {{care not to}} interrupt Mr. Holiday even to ask a question, but looked on and listened very patiently and attentively for nearly half an hour, while he pointed out to Mrs. Holiday the various routes, and ascertained from the guide books the times at which the trains set out, and the steamers sailed, for each of them, and also the cost of getting <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> by the several lines. If the readers of this book were themselves actually in London, and <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris,</b> as Rollo and Jennie were, they would be interested, perhaps, in having all this information laid before them in full detail. As it is, however, all that will be necessary, probably, is to give such a general statement of the case as {{will enable them to}} understand the story.|$|R
