5000|$|Created {{to inform}} and advance {{access to justice}} policy and service {{delivery}} in England and Wales, the LSRC conducted strategic research on legal services and related social policy issues, in both the civil and criminal justice fields. Through its work, the LSRC influenced main aspects <b>of</b> the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> legal aid - from civil and criminal contracting to means testing, the development of outreach and integrated service models, advice in police stations, area-based resource allocation, different modes <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> <b>delivery,</b> and diversity monitoring. Responsible {{for the development of}} the English and Welsh Civil and Social Justice Survey (from 2001 to 2009) and the Civil and Social Justice Panel Survey (from 2010 onwards), much of the LSRC's work focused on people's experience of legal problems and advice-seeking behaviour.|$|R
40|$|Governments face {{increasing}} pressure to implement effective policy to reduce diffuse water pollution from agriculture (DWPA). Various strategies and combinations of policy mechanisms {{have been adopted}} by different countries to change farmer behaviours {{with varying degrees of}} success. This paper focuses on the use <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> <b>delivery</b> to farmers as a mechanism to encourage uptake of DWPA mitigation measures on farms in England. Farm advisory services in England have dramatically changed over recent years, with concerns that the sector has become fragmented due to many organisations and businesses offering advice. This paper studies the role of various farm advisors and organisations providing one-to-one advice by interviewing 81 farm advisors in three agriculturally contrasting regions of England: East Anglia, the North West and South West. Objectives were to assess: which DWPA mitigation measures are being recommended by different advisors? How do recommendations differ between sources <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> and is there any conflict? And which mechanisms do advisors use to influence uptake of advice?Results from the interviews indicate that the advice delivered and the mechanisms used to influence uptake <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> vary between organisations and some advisors do indeed have particular roles within the farm advisory sector. Policy makers therefore need to consider not only what mitigation measures should be encouraged, but also which organisations and advisors are best placed to deliver on the ground advice to farmers. There is also scope to incorporate understandings <b>of</b> farm <b>advice</b> provision into catchment management plans to aid effectiveness of future agri-environmental policy...|$|R
40|$|Decision {{makers and}} forecasters often receive advice from {{different}} sources including human experts and statistical methods. This research examines, {{in the context}} of stock price forecasting, how the apparent source <b>of</b> the <b>advice</b> affects the attention that is paid to it when the mode <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>advice</b> is identical for both sources. In Study 1, two groups of participants were given the same advised point and interval forecasts. One group was told that these were the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> a human expert and the other that they were generated by a statistical forecasting method. The participants were then asked to adjust forecasts they had previously made in light <b>of</b> this <b>advice.</b> While in both cases the advice led to improved point forecast accuracy and better calibration of the prediction intervals, the advice which apparently emanated from a statistical method was discounted much more severely. In Study 2, participants were provided with advice from two sources. When the participants were told that both sources were either human experts or both were statistical methods, the apparent statistical-based advice had the same influence on the adjusted estimates as the advice that appeared to come from a human expert. However when the apparent sources <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> were different, much greater attention was paid to the advice that apparently came from a human expert. Theories <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> utilization are used to identify why the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> a human expert is likely to be preferred to advice from a statistical metho...|$|R

Private banks need to sell and cross-sell their products though doorstep banking which is achieved by a widespread direct sales force. The compensation of sales personnel depends on the volumes of business they fetch for the bank. To assess the behaviour of intermediaries of ICICI Bank, a survey is conducted with a sample size of 473 customers by administering an interview schedule. The data collected has been analysed with ANOVA single factor to study the impact of intermediaries’ behaviour on customer satisfaction and Weighted ANOVA to know the preference of the customers. The results show that, though ICICI Bank is viewed as an immediate service provider, the customers’ rate the service of the bank based on the attitude and behaviour of the intermediaries.

40|$|As in {{the rest}} of Europe, the supply of {{maternity}} hospitals has progressively decreased {{over the past few decades}} in France. An understanding of user choice criteria is important to help health planners reorganize obstetrical services and to predict changes in utilization patterns in response to supply changes. The objectives were to understand the criteria that women use to select their maternity hospital in France and to analyse the relation to individual and community characteristics. A survey of 536 recently delivered women with low-risk pregnancies explored the factors motivating user choice in three territories with distinct geographical and health service supply characteristics: four districts in Burgundy, two districts in Pays de la Loire, and the district of Seine-Saint-Denis in Ile-de-France. Women were asked to select a principal choice criterion. Their responses were grouped into categories: Accessibility/proximity, reputation of the establishment among users, <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> treating physician, technical quality and cost. Accessibility and proximity were the most selected criteria (33 %), followed by the reputation of the maternity (29 %), technical quality (15 %) and <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> treating physician (13 %). Age, parity and education influenced choice criteria. After controlling for individual determinants, region of residence was highly related to choice criteria; women living in Burgundy were more likely to select an establishment based on proximity, in Seine-Saint-Denis women were more likely to follow the <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> their physician, and in Pays de la Loire, more likely to base their decisions on the reputation of the establishment. The association between choice criteria and community characteristics could explain the failure of previous models to predict behaviour in different contexts. It is important to carry out local surveys of user perceptions before restructuring in order to take into consideration women's opinions on their future places <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> and to refine geographic models.
