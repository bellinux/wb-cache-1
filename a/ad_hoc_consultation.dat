40|$|Letter dated February 13, 1989 from CGIAR Chairman W. David Hopper to {{heads of}} {{delegations}} to the CGIAR, also {{distributed to the}} Group more broadly. The letter discussed the deliberations and decisions of 'Bellagio II'- the Second Bellagio Meeting on Tropical Forestry - held two months earlier in the United Kingdom, chaired by Mr. Hopper, and the proposed expansion of the CGIAR's mandate to include forestry and agroforestry. A second major topic was {{the process by which}} the centers and the CGIAR Secretariat had adjusted to a 5 % shortfall in contributions compared with requirements for 1989. This involved voluntary reductions by centers, and support from the Stabilization Mechanism. Hopper reported in World Bank disbursements to centers, and described a project to transcribe and distribute CGIAR publications on CD-ROM. He also reported on decisions by the WARDA Council of Ministers to write off back debts to WARDA from the member countries, make fresh annual assessments, and reaffirm the constitution that had been negotiated as a framework for continued CGIAR support. Hopper outlined the agenda for an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>consultation</b> of donors scheduled for March 1989.

The CGIAR Secretariat {{anticipated}} an overall shortfall of $ 15 million in 1981 resulting from the combination of proposed IARC budget increases and inflation. After negotiations with centers, the CGIAR Secretariat proposed a compromise under which all centers would receive proportionately reduced funding, for established centers from their 1980 levels, and for developing centers from their planned 1981 levels. After reviewing center plans in working groups, a new procedure, TAC approved the proposal with some exceptions. TAC endorsed {{the recommendations of the}} quinquennial review panel of IBPGRBefore formal submission of its proposal for a new center on water management, TAC decided to circulate it to members of the Group for informal comment. Although the TAC mission to ICIPE had recommended CGIAR support, TAC found ICIPE's program did not fit sufficiently well with CGIAR priorities to merit positive action. TAC decided to submit a consultant's stripe review of IARC off campus activities and a compendium of those activities to the CGIAR. TAC recommended further attention to off campus activities by the System Review, particularly to coordination of regional programs and national projects across centers and the interaction of core and special funding. Following up on an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>consultation</b> on aquaculture research organized by FAO, TAC supported further discussions to identifying research priorities, leading toward a mechanism for international support. Both the centers and TAC found plant breeders rights had little impact on genetic erosion, and created no major problems for IARC breeding research.

40|$|Effects of {{expected}} climate change on soil processes, {{especially in the}} Tropics and Subtropics. {{was the subject of}} a workshop organized by UNEP, CTA and the International Society of Soil Science (ISSS) in Nairobi from 12 - 14 February 1990. This was followed (15 - 17 February) by an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>consultation</b> meeting on 'Assessment of global desertification: status and methodologies [...] Dr M K Tolba, Executive Director of UNEP gave an overview of the current situation and alternative future scenarios, stressing the determination of UNEP to help in the assessment of consequences by predictive analysis of the effect {{of expected}} climatic changes on soil processes and possible soil degradation. The workshop began with overviews on the historical development of climate and its relations to the smaller but more reactive biochemical cycle and the larger but strongly buffered geochemical cycle, which changes only slowly. There were also reports on the inputs of soils and agriculture to the greenhouse effect and to changing climate. This was followed by a geographical analysis of the expected changes of soil properties In various regions of the world (sub-polar, boreal, subboreal. Mediterranean/subtropical and tropical) with special emphasis on the African, Latin American and South-east Asian environments. Certain soil characteristics are bound to be affected by changing climate: soil moisture; texture, structure and erosion; secondary clay minerals; soil pH and Eh (redox potential); salinization and alkalinization; and soil organic matter content in response to changes in decomposition, recycling and biological activity. All these were discussed, as was the influence of changing climate on problem soils, especially those typical of the densely populated alluvial regions. The effect of climate changes on the yield potential of major cropping systems and soil vegetation interactions was also considered. Attention was also focussed on the interacting effect of man-made pollution and the physical effects of predicted sea level rises on global soil changes. Existing modelling systems were scrutinized and management possibilities for curtailing trace gas emissions by the creation of new sinks and by changing management from slash and bum to more sustainable agricultural land use systems. Three working groups on major problem areas considered research priorities. Among their conclusions were that climate changes are more likely to be apparent in cold and temperate regions than in the tropics but that exceptions will be coastal swamp and montaine regions in the tropics, irrigated areas, semi-arid regions, deforested areas and natural wetlands. Long-term monitoring to detect ecologically relevant changes related to climate change and modelling to derive predictions for management are vital for these zones that are most at risk. Data required from climatologists will include estimates of year to yearend month to month variability in mean and annual temperature and especially in rainfall. Also, the ecologists and crop production physiologists will need to measure effects of increased carbon dioxide levels on organic matter return to the soil and, in addition to quantity, qualitative aspects of the organic matter (possible changes in biodegradability) should be considered. One of the working groups emphasized in their conclusions that perhaps the essential overriding processes are those termed 'anthropogenic': the implications of man'. influence on soil processes and ecosystems are such that they tend to overshadow attempts to deal with natural ecosystem' and climate-induced changes. They have the potential to change the course of civilization if ignored. The full recommendations of the three working groups on major problem areas will appear in the proceedings of the workshop which will serve as an up-to-date reference for soil scientists and for governments.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, EU–Russia gas {{relations}} have witnessed significant deterioration—the bilateral agenda has been narrowed down to <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>consultations,</b> disputes over investment and long-term contract provisions have multiplied, and disagreements between the EU and Russia have significantly hindered the multilateral {{process of the}} Energy Charter Treaty (the ECT). This deterioration seems to be rather paradoxical in light of high gas interdependence between the EU and Russia and a rich history of well-established cooperation during the Cold War under profound ideological and strategic constraints. In addition, conflictual patterns in EU–Russia gas relations occurred {{in the beginning of}} the 2000 s, during the period of high oil prices and growing global natural gas demand—the period when enhancement of cooperation would be a more expected outcome. Therefore, the core research question of the thesis addresses the puzzle: why, despite decades of cooperation during the Cold War between Western European countries and the USSR, have EU–Russia gas relations become conflictual since the 2000 s? By answering this research question, the study seeks to contribute to the analysis of institutionalisation of energy relations and to reveal factors that lead to cooperative or conflictual outcomes. So far, IR research inquiries in the field have prioritised resource and normative determinisms in addressing the success or failure of energy cooperation, which assume a geopolitical-realist struggle for energy resources and a priori benevolence of free markets in line with the neoliberal economic agenda respectively. The broader geopolitical approach has explained energy conflicts by structural factors of unequal resource allocation across the world and attributed a direct impact of a state resource base (an energy-rich or energy-poor state) on states’ behaviour in the international arena. Another strand of the literature, ‘the market approach’, has also viewed problematic cooperation as a result of different interests of energy producers and consumers—but from a slightly different perspective. Limited institutionalisation of interactions has been explained by different models of gas markets producers and consumers choose. Thus, consumers favour a model of the competitive liberalised gas market (a market actor model), while producers would opt for a model of vertically-integrated monopoly and resource nationalism (a geopolitical actor model) in order to preserve control over resources. Pointing to a number of opposite cases, this study disregards the straightforward assumption that there is a direct link between a resource base and states’ strategies in the international arena. Bringing domestic conditions back to these debates, the study argues that increasing differences between the EU and Russia’s domestic institutional models of the gas market have been the main factor that has triggered conflictual patterns in EU–Russia gas relations since the 2000 s. These domestic institutional changes have replaced attempts to build a strategic partnership with <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>consultations</b> at the level of practical implementation, and have triggered broader deinstitutionalisation of multilateral gas governance in Europe. The three case studies analyse three instances of EU–Russia gas relations, tracing the crucial differences to determine the outcome—cooperation (a creation of a new or enhancement of an existing international institution), institutionalised conflict (disagreements regarding institutional settings of interactions, which are discussed and settled within the procedures of pre-existing or negotiated international institutions), or institutional conflict (expansion of disagreements beyond the pre-existing or negotiated framework of international institutions, which are no more accepted by the parties for conflict resolution) between the parties. The thesis contributes to ongoing debates about the impact of domestic institutions on actors’ policy strategies in the international arena, bringing insights from energy economics, energy law, and regulatory studies to IR. It argues that differences in domestic models under conditions of high interdependence might lead to politicisation of gas market issues and broader aspects of energy governance. The study also enriches debates about energy security, arguing that energy security depends also on a stable and predictable institutional framework for interactions, which inter alia requires compatibility of actors’ domestic models. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Hailed by President Clinton as the "roadmap for the 21 st century", the New Transatlantic Agenda (NTA) and the Joint Action Plan (JAP) were {{designed}} to be a watershed in US-EU relations. Rooted in the revolutionary changes of the late 1980 s/early 1990 s, the US and the EU realized that they were entering the uncertainty of a new and unprecedented political era - the post-Cold War world - which called for a fundamental overhaul of transatlantic relations. It quickly became obvious that the political dialogue between the two needed to be reinvigorated and incorporate a wider area of policy objectives. Ergo, it was necessary {{to move away from the}} <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>consultations</b> common during the Cold War, and cope with issues which were formerly for the most part unilaterally dealt with by the United States. Only a few years after the first attempt of strengthening transatlantic ties culminated in the Transatlantic Declaration of 1990, policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic realized that further cooperation was called for. At the US-EU summit in Madrid on 3 December 1995, President Bill Clinton, Spanish Prime Minister and President of the EU Council Felipe Gonzalez, and European Commission President Jacques Santer announced a New Transatlantic Agenda (NTA) and a Joint Action Plan (JAP) to forge even closer ties between the United States and the European Union by implementing coordinated policies on a range of the most pressing economic, political, security, humanitarian, environmental and cultural issues. The initiative was a concise plan laying out concrete action plans to cope with today's interdependent world in which challenges facing the United States and the European Union could no longer be dealt with satisfactorily by either party acting alone. Transnational in nature, these challenges, such as international crime, drug trafficking, terrorism, environmental degradation and the spread of communicable diseases, required resources which exceeded those at the disposal of either the US or the EU acting alone. In particular, the two sides promised joined actions to work towards the following four goals: (I) promoting peace and stability and fostering democracy and development around the world (II) responding to new global challenges (III) contributing to the expansion of world trade and closer economic relations (IV) building social and cultural bridges across the Atlantic. Based on the Agenda, the Joint Action Plan is a more comprehensive document which contains 150 longer-term specific objectives from which a number are selected for regular updating of the Agenda between subsequent US-EU summit meetings. The following assessment explores the origins of the Agenda in general and the overall state of transatlantic relations during the 1990 's in particular. Furthermore, each policy area is discussed and evaluated from an American and European point of view. Lastly, potential points of friction are examined and a prospect for bringing the Agenda to fruition will be undertaken...|$|R

We show that providing entity authentication and authentic key exchange in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks is a security problem still not satisfyingly solved. The next contribution of this paper is the introduction of a general protocol framework for the implementation of authentication and key establishment protocols in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks. The combination of the derived design goals and the protocol framework enables us to examine existing <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network protocols and to develop new authentication and key establishment protocols that are applicable in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks while meeting the network’s security requirements at the same time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Many real {{systems are}} hybrid {{networks}} which include infrastructure nodes in multi-hop wireless networks, such as sinks in sensor networks and mesh routers in mesh networks. However, {{we have very}} little understanding of network connectivity in such networks. Therefore, in this paper, we consider hybrid networks denoted by H(α, β) with <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> nodes and base stations and prove how base stations can improve the connectivity of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> nodes in subcritical phase, that is, the <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> node density, λα {{is lower than the}} critical density λcα. We find that with the existence of a positive density of base stations, i. e., the density of base stations λβ> 0 which have the same transmission range as <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> nodes, the number of connected <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> nodes is Θ(n) with probability nearly 1, where n is the number of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> nodes. However, the size of connected <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> component scales linearly with λβ when it is lower than c 1 (λα) with probability nearly 1, which demonstrates a tremendous benefit of using base stations to enhance the connectivity of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> nodes. Further, we study a hybrid network architecture that makes a significant connectivity improvement with transmission range rβ larger than rα for <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> nodes. Therefore, our results provide a theoretical understanding of to what extent <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> nodes can benefit from base stations in multi-hop wireless networks. I...|$|R

We address some of the key performance problems in the broader realm of wireless <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks, including mobile <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks and emerging wireless <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> sensor networks. Wireless <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks represent autonomous distributed systems that are infrastructureless, fully distributed, and multi-hop in nature. Over the last several years, wireless <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks have attracted considerable research attention in the general networking and performance community. This has been fueled by recent technological advances in the development of multifunctional and low-cost wireless communication devices. Wireless <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks have diverse applications spanning several domains, including military, commercial, medical, and home networks. The results of all this research activity the wireless <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks are starting to move from the research domain into the real world and are being gradually integrated into our daily lives. Projections indicate that this will accelerate later in the decade, to the point where some analysts predict that these types of self-organizin...|$|R
