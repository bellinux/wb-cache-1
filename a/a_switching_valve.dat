The method uses two columns: an Agilent Zorbax C 8 (150 mm 4. 6 mm, 5 mm particle size) reversed-phase column and a Waters Symmetry C 18 (150 mm 4. 6 mm, 5 mm particle size) reversed-phase column. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a programmed gradient mobile phase consisting of (A) 0. 1 % formic acid in water and (B) 0. 1 % formic acid in acetonitrile.

Because of this importance of valves, it is desirable to observe these parts to detect faults, both when they are occurring and before they can cause serious damage.
