30|$|These codec {{adaptation}} {{schemes and}} {{policies have been}} evaluated through a C++ simulator, developed from scratch using the COST simulation toolkit [31]. Roughly, the simulator consists of three blocks: (i) a call generator, responsible for generating the new calls and choosing/assigning the characteristics of each call (STA's processor capacity, VoIP codecs supported, etc.), (ii) a rate change block, which randomly changes the rate of <b>active</b> <b>calls,</b> and (iii) the codec adaptation block which, {{based on the number}} of <b>active</b> <b>calls</b> and the current rate and codec of each one, decides the actions to be taken in the case of a rate change or a new call arrival. The WLAN cell capacity is forecasted using the multirate/multicodec (MR/MC) capacity index explained and validated in Section 5.1.|$|R

50|$|Note: Generally {{when the}} Primary Servers fails and Phones try to Register Secondary or Backup Call agents, Phone {{instruments}} take a complete reboot.

50|$|Mobile phone {{tracking}} is the ascertaining of {{the position}} or location of a mobile phone, whether stationary or moving. Localization may occur either via multilateration of radio signals between (several) cell towers of the network and the phone, or simply via GPS. To locate a mobile phone using multilateration of radio signals, it must emit at least the roaming signal to contact the next nearby antenna tower, but the process does not require an <b>active</b> <b>call.</b> The Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) {{is based on the}} phone's signal strength to nearby antenna masts.|$|E

30|$|Nonadaptive Case (NA). This case {{presents}} high blocking {{and dropping}} probabilities leading to less <b>active</b> <b>calls,</b> as expected, since no adaptation is possible.

40|$|In the {{telecommunications}} network {{or the public}} Internet, softswitches are the software implementation of central devices that connect calls between phone lines, usually executing on a general-purpose computer system. “Softswitch” is short for “software switch”, which implies the use of general purpose servers and VoIP technology, instead of purpose-built electronic hardware. This paper presents (1) an overview {{of some of the}} main characteristics of three popular softswitches: Asterisk, FreeSWITCH, and Yate; (2) measures their performances on a designed scenario with identical initial parameters, and (3) presents the results of conducted performance tests. The methodology is comprised of two test scenarios; Test 1 implies generating 800 <b>active</b> <b>calls</b> on a freshly booted system, and sustaining them for 20 minutes. Monitored parameters include CPU utilization and Linux 5 minute system load. Test 2 consists of sustained 5 calls per second, and monitored parameter is the number of active calls; the purpose is to obtain the maximum <b>active</b> <b>calls</b> sustained. By analyzing test outcomes of the performed simulations, FreeSWITCH showed highest performance results in both scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{continuation}} of an <b>active</b> <b>call</b> {{is one of}} the most important quality measurements in cellular systems. Handoff process enables a cellular system to provide such a facility by transferring an <b>active</b> <b>call</b> from one cell to another. Different approaches are proposed and applied in order to achieve better handoff service. The principal parameters used to evaluate handoff techniques are: Forced termination probability and call blocking probability. Mechanisms such as guard channels and queuing handoff calls decrease the forced termination probability while increasing the call blocking probability. In this paper we present an overview about the issues related to handoff initiation and decision and discuss about different types of handoff techniques available in the literature...|$|E

40|$|Handover {{decisions}} in GSM networks {{are based on}} the difference in received signal strength, between the serving cell and the neighboring cells. But in a practical scenario, particularly in city area,considering difference in signal level strength alone, is an inferior criteria to decide handover issue,because the towers are in close proximity & the absolute signal strength is quite good to continue the communication,without much difficulty. Also, in these environments, multipath reflections, scattering due to moving vehicles & diffraction from multiple building edges,contributes to poor signal quality, hence forcing the mobile to transmit more power to continue the communication. Continuation of an <b>active</b> <b>call</b> {{is one of the most}} important quality measures in the cellular systems. Handover process enables a cellular system to provide such a facility by transferring an <b>active</b> <b>call</b> from one cell to another. Different approaches have been proposed and applied in order to achieve better handover service, by various researchers. The principal parameters considered in the present work, which are used to evaluate handover techniques are: Received signal quality (RxQual), FER, Received signal level, MS-BS distance, transmit power (TxPower) & aggregate C/I. In the present work, thorough analysis has been done for the received signal strength difference threshold, along with other RF quality parameters. To ensure best performance to all mobile users at all times and all locations an active set of parameters has been calculated for critical values along with signal strength difference threshold...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: evaluate, through <b>active</b> <b>call,</b> {{lifestyles of}} an {{asymptomatic}} population {{in order to}} identify hyperglycaemic subjects and/or high-blood pressure sufferers to dispatch to their GP to perform suitable checking, and subjects to invite to a cardiovascular disease prevention programme because of their lifestyles. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: between January 2009 and July 2012, all healthy residents in the Local Health Authority of Este (ULSS 17 Este) aged 45 - 59 years were invited to join a cardiovascular disease prevention programme. DESIGN: all participants were evaluated through an administered lifestyle questionnaire. Parameters such as blood pressure (BP), glycaemia, waist circumference and body mass index were collected and recorded. Participants also received counseling, informational materials on lifestyle and were invited to individual or group health promotion initiatives in relation to personal risk factors. RESULTS: among the invited, 55. 5 % (3, 922 / 7, 071) adhered. Women (58. 8 %) responded significantly better than men (51. 9 %) (p < 0, 01). Subjects without risks factors were 16. 7 %. Subjects with lifestyle risk factors but normal BP and glycaemia were 49. 4 %, while those adding altered values for BP and glycaemia were 25. 2 %. The 8. 6 % of the respondents were not eligible for the study. CONCLUSIONS: the preliminary results suggest that a preventive programme based on the citizens <b>active</b> <b>call</b> by the Department of Prevention could be an effective tool to identify asymptomatic individuals with unknown hypertension and/or hyperglycaemia and to offer lifestyle interventions to lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{cooperative}} {{multiple access}} protocol for packet speech communications is proposed, where cooperation is achieved through {{the deployment of}} a relay node that exploits the silence periods typical of speech communications. The relay forwards speech packets for <b>active</b> <b>calls</b> using {{a subset of the}} free time slots left available by users that are silent. No new channel resources are needed for cooperation and the system encounters no bandwidth losses. Because the resources allocated to the relay are not drawn from the pool of reused resources but from those potentially used for random channel access. Thus, the use of cooperation introduces a tradeoff between the amount of help offered to <b>active</b> <b>calls</b> and the probability of a successful contention for channel access. Such cooperation tradeoff is investigated and guidelines for the choice of protocol parameters are developed. The throughput and delay performance of the proposed protocol are characterized and compared to a similar non-cooperative packet speech protocol. Results demonstrate significant gains achieved by the proposed cooperative protocol. Moreover, the speech quality under the cooperative protocol was measured using a perceptual model, and results reveal significant improvement over the non-cooperative protocol especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime.
