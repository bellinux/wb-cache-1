40|$|Although {{it is well}} {{established}} that early expression of TCRbeta transgenes in the thymus leads to efficient inhibition of both endogenous TCRbeta and TCRgamma rearrangement (also known as <b>allelic</b> and "isotypic" <b>exclusion,</b> respectively) the role of pTalpha in these processes remains controversial. Here, we have systematically re-evaluated this issue using three independent strains of TCRbeta-transgenic mice that differ widely in transgene expression levels, and a sensitive intracellular staining assay that detects endogenous TCRVbeta expression in individual immature thymocytes. In the absence of pTalpha, both <b>allelic</b> and isotypic <b>exclusion</b> were reversed in all three TCRbeta-transgenic strains, clearly demonstrating a general requirement for pre-TCR signaling in the inhibition of endogenous TCRbeta and TCRgamma rearrangement. Both <b>allelic</b> and isotypic <b>exclusion</b> were pTalpha dose dependent when transgenic TCRbeta levels were subphysiological. Moreover, pTalpha-dependent <b>allelic</b> and isotypic <b>exclusion</b> occurred in both alphabeta and gammadelta T cell lineages, indicating that pre-TCR signaling can potentially be functional in gammadelta precursors. Finally, levels of endogenous RAG 1 and RAG 2 were not down-regulated in TCRbeta-transgenic immature thymocytes undergoing <b>allelic</b> or isotypic <b>exclusion.</b> Collectively, our data reveal a critical but lineage-nonspecific role for pTalpha in mediating both <b>allelic</b> and isotypic <b>exclusion</b> in TCRbeta-transgenic mice...|$|R

We have recently provided evidence for genetic linkage of the molecular defect in a large family with dominant simplex, generalized (Koebner) type of EB (EBS 2) to the long arm of chromosome 1. Because human nidogen gene has been mapped to chromosomal locus 1 q 43 in the human genome, we examined the possibility that nidogen, an integral component of all basement membranes, would be the candidate gene in this family of EBS 2. Restriction fragment- length polymorphism, which was shown with several restriction endonucleases to be present within the nidogen gene, was utilized for linkage analyses. The results using an informative PvuII polymorphism as a marker of <b>allelic</b> inheritance supported <b>exclusion</b> of the EBS 2 locus from approximately 10 cM in either side of the nidogen locus, when Lod score of - 2. 0 was taken as the limit of exclusion.

40|$|The {{ontogeny}} of the immunoglobulin (Ig) {{gene rearrangement}} in mammalian B cells {{seems to be}} ordered. Heavy chain gene segments rearrange first, followed by light chain gene segments, kappa before lambda. The genomic organization of murine lambda locus does not preclude the simultaneous expression of two subtypes from the same chromosome. In order to distinguish between an ordered and a stochastic model of rearrangement, a panel of 67 B cell hybridomas secreting either lambda 1, lambda 2, lambda 3 or lambda x (recently described) were analysed for V lambda J lambda rearrangements. The results show that in 97 % of cases, a single rearrangement occurred, favouring the stochastic model over the ordered one. Strikingly, the possibility of having a productive rearrangement if the first try results in an aberrant one is rare. We propose therefore, that the lambda Ig is not necessarily required to ensure <b>allelic</b> and subtypic <b>exclusion</b> mechanisms. Moreover, in 97 % of the cases, at least one kappa allele is rearranged. Furthermore, the RS recombination has been detected in 77 % of the cases.

40|$|It {{has often}} been {{suggested}} that the parental-specific expression of mammalian imprinted genes might be dependent on maternal-paternal intergenomic or interallelic interactions. Using quantitative allele-specific RT-PCR single nucleotide primer extension assays developed for two imprinted genes, Snrpn and Igf 2 r, we demonstrate: (i) No role for maternal-paternal allelic interactions: the modes of parental-specific expression of Snrpn and Igf 2 r in normal ova were unchanged in gynogenetic and androgenetic ova; the latter contain two maternal and two paternal genomes respectively, and cannot undergo maternal-paternal interactions. (ii) No role for <b>allelic</b> counting or <b>exclusion</b> mechanisms: in individual blastomeres of androgenetic ova, both paternal Snrpn alleles were active (Snrpn was not expressed in gynogenetic ova), and in individual gynogenetic and androgenetic blastomeres, both maternal and paternal Igf 2 r alleles, respectively, were active. (iii) No role for ploidy: the mode of parental-specific expression of Snrpn and Igf 2 r in normal diploid ova was unchanged in individual blastomeres of triploid and tetraploid ova. Thus, the maternal and paternal genomes function independently in establishing the pre-implantation mode of parental-specific expression of Snrpn and Igf 2 r, with no role for trans-allelic/genomic interaction phenomena. In addition, {{the results show that}} inactive and biallelic modes of expression of imprinted genes are potential mechanisms for the death of gynogenones and androgenones at the peri-implantation stage...|$|R
40|$|Part I: The B cell antigen {{receptor}} (BCR) {{consists of two}} immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) chains, two immunoglobulin light (IgL) chains and the signaling molecules Ig alpha and Ig beta. The variable regions of IgH and IgL chains confer antigen specificity and are assembled from various gene segments through a unique series of somatic recombination events. Ig rearrangement is a developmentally regulated process with IgH rearranging prior to IgL. IgL rearrangements can take place on two distinct genomic loci, Ig lambda and Ig kappa, but occur more frequently at the latter. Previous results suggested that the unrearranged Ig kappa locus negatively regulates Ig lambda transcription and/or rearrangement. Here, I demonstrate that expression of a pre-rearranged lambda 1 light chain gene inserted into the Ig lambda locus is independent of Ig kappa rearrangements. Expression of the inserted lambda 1 gene is developmentally regulated {{like that of a}} pre-rearranged Ig kappa gene inserted into the Ig kappa locus and coincides developmentally with the occurrence of Ig kappa rearrangements in wild-type mice. I thus conclude that transcription of a gene rearrangement in the Ig lambda locus is developmentally controlled and not negatively regulated by the unrearranged Ig kappa locus. Mice carrying an inserted lambda 1 light chain gene undergo secondary IgL rearrangements at a frequency that is comparable to WT mice. This process is presumably a consequence of receptor editing in B cells that expressed an auto-reactive IgH/Iglambda 1 pair. Unlike Ig kappa rearrangements, Ig lambda rearrangements cannot be deleted from the genome and the resulting �receptor-edited� lambda 1 + B cells express both the inserted lambda 1 light chain and an endogenous Ig kappa molecule on the cell surface. While <b>allelic</b> and isotype <b>exclusion</b> generally ensure that B cells express a unique receptor specificity, my results indicate that dual receptor specificity poses no problem for the generation of mature B cells. However, B cells with two distinct receptor specificities are counterselected upon BCR-ligand interaction, which is a crucial event during immune responses and possibly in the generation of B 1 cells. Counterselection of Ig kappa/Ig lambda double positive B cells can occur on the protein level and on the genomic level and ensures the generation of an antigen-specific immune response. Part II: For the last decade, Cre/loxP-mediated conditional mutagenesis has been instrumental to the study of gene function in mice. Both Cre-mediated deletion and inversion of loxP-flanked gene segments are widely used to manipulate the mouse genome. While Cre-mediated deletion is essentially unidirectional, inversion is reversible and therefore does not support the stable alteration of gene function in cells that constitutively express Cre. Site-directed mutagenesis yielded a pair of asymmetric loxP sites (lox 66 and lox 71) that displays a favorable forward reaction equilibrium in vitro. Here, I demonstrate that lox 66 /lox 71 mediates efficient and predominantly unidirectional inversion of a switch substrate that has been targeted into the mouse genome. lox 66 /lox 71 -mediated recombination was two to three times less efficient than that of a WT loxP pair both in vitro and in vivo. Inversion efficiency was generally dependent on Cre expression levels and near complete lox 66 /lox 71 -mediated inversion could be observed in vivo using both an inducible and a cell-type specific cre transgene. Reverse recombination was undetectable in most tissues. Taken together, lox 66 /lox 71 allows essentially unidirectional gene inversion. Its efficiency is, however, dependent on the expression level of the cre transgene of choice. Over the past few years, RNAi has been introduced as an additional means to manipulate gene expression. RNAi allows the simultaneous knock-down of several highly homologous gene products using a single short hairpin RNA (shRNA) encoding transgene. Here, I combined RNAi with Cre/loxP technology to create a system that will allow the cell type-specific and/or developmentally regulated induction of RNAi in mice. In order to control shRNA expression by Cre, I designed a loxP-flanked transcription termination cassette, which can be removed by Cre-mediated recombination. A transgene encoding this inducible expression vector has been integrated into the mouse HPRT locus. Efficient and sequence-specific knock-down of a target gene was observed with a single copy of this transgene in embryonic stem cells and this process was strictly dependent on Cre...|$|R

50|$|CD179a (VpreB) is a 126 aa-long {{polypeptide}} with apparent MW of 16-18 kDa. It {{is expressed}} selectively {{at the early}} stages of B cell development, namely, in proB and early preB cells. CD179a has an Ig V domain-like structure, but lacks the last beta-strand (beta7) of a typical V domain. Instead, it has a carboxyl terminal end that shows no sequence homologies to any other proteins. CD179a associates non-covalently with CD179b (lambda5 or lambda-like) carrying an Ig C domain-like structure to form an Ig light chain-like structure, which is called the surrogate light chain or pseudo light chain. In this complex, the incomplete V domain of CD179a appears to be complemented by the extra beta7 strand of CD179b. On the surface of early preB cells, CD179a/CD179b surrogate light chain is disulfide-linked to membrane-bound Ig mu heavy chain in association with a signal transducer CD79a/CD79b heterodimer to form a B cell receptor-like structure, so-called preB cell receptor (preBCR). Though no CD179a-related human disease or pathology has been reported yet, the deficiency of other components of preB cell receptor such as CD179b, Ig mu heavy chain and CD79a has been shown to result in severe impairment of B cell development and agammaglobulinemia in human. PreBCR transduces signals for: 1) cellular proliferation, differentiation from the proB cell to preB cell stage, 2) <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> at the Ig heavy chain gene locus, and 3) promotion of Ig light chain gene rearrangements. Thus, preBCR functions as a checkpoint in early B cell development to monitor the production of Ig mu heavy chain through a functional rearrangement of Ig heavy chain gene as well as the potency of Ig mu heavy chain to associate with Ig light chain.|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> ensures that each B cell expresses a B-cell {{receptor}} encoded {{by only one}} of its Ig heavy (IgH) and light (IgL) chain alleles.

In the latter, the recruited IgH allele was reported to be transcriptionally silent. However, it is not known whether monoallelic recruitment during establishment of <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> correlates with transcriptional silencing. To investigate this, we assessed the transcriptional status of both IgH alleles in single primary cells over the course of B-cell development, using RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization. Before <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> both alleles are transcribed. Thereafter, in pre-BII and subsequent developmental stages both functional and nonfunctional VDJ- and DJ-transcription is observed.

40|$|In diploid cells, <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> reduces {{genes to}} {{functional}} haploidy, because {{only one of}} two alleles is active. It is best known in cells producing immunoglobu-lins, but other examples also exist. X-chromosome inactivation in female mammals is related to <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion,</b> {{but in this case}} the dosage compensation mechanism extends to the whole chromosome. Func-tional hemizygosity in some mammalian cell lines is probably also due to <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion,</b> where one autosomal allele is active and the other is methylated and inactive. In early development, it may be important to have only one functional copy of specific regulatory genes. If one considers the possible mechanisms whereby genes are switched from an active to an inactive form, or vice versa, complications arise if the same type of switch operates in two homologous chromosomes segregating independently at mitosis. This complication is avoided if one of the genes is totally inactive. It is therefore suggested that important regulatory genes are subject to <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> and that this provides a basis for genomic imprinting. Male or female gametes comp-lement in the zygote, because they may have different inactive genes, and the active allele in each case is then functionally haploid in the zygote and developing embryo. These haploid genes would be those involved in critical switches of gene activity during the developmen-tal process. <b>Allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> imposed by imprinting might be based on the heritable DNA methylation of the regulatory regions of silent genes.

Analysis of these mice revealed that germline transcription is biallelic and occurs in all pre-B cells. Moreover, we found that the two germline promoters in this region are not equivalent but that the distal promoter accounts for the vast majority of observed germline transcript in pre-B cells while the activity of the proximal promoter increases later in development. <b>Allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> of the Igκ locus thus occurs at the level of rearrangement, but not germline transcription...|$|E

40|$|<b>Allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> in κ light-chain {{synthesis}} {{is thought}} to result from a feedback mechanism by which {{the expression of a}} functional κ light chain {{on the surface of the}} B cell leads to an intracellular signal that down-regulates the V(D) J recombinase, thus precluding rearrangement of the other allele. Whereas such a feedback mechanism clearly plays a role in the maintenance of <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion,</b> here we provide evidence suggesting that the initial establishment of <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> involves differential availability of the two κ alleles for rearrangement. Analysis of κ+ B-cell populations and of individual κ+ B cells that have rearranged only one allele demonstrates that in these cells, critical sites on the rearranged allele are unmethylated, whereas the nonrearranged allele remains methylated. This pattern is apparently generated by demethylation that is initiated at the small pre-B cell stage, on a single allele, in a process that occurs prior to rearrangement and requires the presence in cis of both the intronic and 3 ′ κ enhancers. Taken together with data demonstrating that undermethylation is required for rearrangement, these results indicate that demethylation may actually underly the process of <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> by directing the initial choice of a single κ allele for rearrangement...|$|E

40|$|The {{adaptive}} {{immune system}} requires a diverse repertoire of antigen receptors to effectively respond to pathogens. Antigen receptor diversity is generated through the recombination of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments in developing B and T lymphocytes. Though all lymphocytes contain two allelic copies of antigen receptor loci most recombine and express receptor chains from a single allele, a phenomenon known as 2 ̆ 2 <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> 2 ̆ 2. Early experiments in the 1980 s identified that an antigen receptor chain expressed from one allele signaled feedback inhibition of V-to-(D) J recombination on the other allele. However, more recent findings suggest that additional mechanisms contribute to the mono-allelic expression of antigen receptor chains. The data presented in this thesis uses various mouse models to discover and investigate three mechanisms that regulate antigen receptor <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion.</b> First, posttranscriptional silencing of functional VβDJβ rearrangements ensures the mono-allelic expression of TCRβ genes. Second, the DNA damage response protein, ATM, enforces Igκ, IgH, and TCRβ <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion,</b> suppresses bi-allelic rearrangements at these loci, and inhibits RAG expression. Lastly, the cell cycle protein, cyclin D 3 functions alone and in cooperation with ATM to enforce IgH and TCRβ <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion.</b> Together, these data demonstrate that multiple, successive mechanism have evolved to prevent the bi-allelic rearrangement and expression of antigen receptor genes. ...|$|E

For Tcrb to be allelically excluded the two alleles must initiate recombination asynchronously and once a β-protein is selected, feedback signals must suppress further recombination. Earlier studies of antigen-receptor loci implicated directed monoallelic association with pericentromeric heterochromatin in the initiation or maintenance of <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion.</b> In this study we used three-dimensional fluorescent in situ hybridization to directly visualize the nuclear localization of Tcra and Tcrb, pericentromeric heterochromatin, and the nuclear lamina. Here we provide evidence for a fundamentally different basis for Tcrb <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion.</b> We demonstrate that Tcrb is highly associated with pericentromeric heterochromatin and the nuclear lamina in pro-B cells and in DN and DP thymocytes. We also find that Tcrb does not associate with peri-centromeric heterochromatin and the nuclear lamina in a strict monoallelic fashion. Rather, Tcrb alleles independently associate with the two compartments, leading to a stochastic distribution of nuclei containing both, one, or neither allele associated. In the subset of DN thymocyte nuclei with monoallelically associated Tcrb alleles, the non-rearranged allele is most often associated with repressive compartments. This suggests that association with these compartments inhibits recombination prior to β-selection. This inhibition occurs without altering the conformation of the locus. Moreover, the introduction of an ectopic enhancer into Tcrb, led to both a repositioning of Tcrb away from these repressive compartments. This repositioning was correlated {{with an increase in}} the frequency of recombination and a break in <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion.</b> These data lead us to propose that stochastic rather than directed interactions of Tcrb alleles with repressive nuclear compartments bias initial Tcrb recombination to be monoallelic in developing thymocytes and that such interactions are essential for Tcrb <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion.</b> Dissertatio...|$|E

Adaptive responses to immune challenge {{are based on the}} expression of a single species of antigen receptor per cell; and in B cells, this is mediated in part by <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> at the Ig heavy (H) chain locus. How <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> is regulated is unclear; we considered that sharks, the oldest vertebrates possessing the Ig/ TCR-based immune system, would yield insights not previously approachable and reveal the primordial basis of the regulation of <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion.</b> Sharks have an IgH locus organization consisting of 15 – 200 independently rearranging miniloci (V H-D 1 -D 2 -J H-Cl), a gene organization that is considered ancestral to the tetrapod and bony fish IgH locus. We found that rearrangement takes place only within a minilocus, and the recombining gene segments are assembled simultaneously and randomly. Only one or few H chain genes were fully rearranged in each shark B cell, whereas the other loci retained their germline configuration. In contrast, most IgH were partially rearranged in every thymocyte (developing T cell) examined, but no IgH transcripts were detected. The distinction between B and T cells in their IgH configurations and transcription reveals a heretofore unsuspected chromatin state permissive for rearrangement in precursor lymphocytes, and suggests that controlled limitation of B cell lineage-specific factors mediate regulated rearrangement and <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion.</b> This regulation may be shared by higher vertebrates in which additional mechanistic and regulatory elements have evolved with their structurally complex IgH locus...|$|E

In P 13 −/− mice, cleavage, rearrangement, and transcription of Vβ 13, but not the flanking Vβ gene segments, were significantly inhibited. In P 13 R/R mice, inhibition of Vβ 13 rearrangement was less severe and {{was not associated with}} any apparent reduction in Vβ 13 cleavage. Expression of a T-cell receptor (TCR) transgene blocked cleavages at the normal Vβ 13 -recombination signal sequence junction and Vβ 13 coding joint formation of both wild-type and mutant Vβ 13 alleles. However, a low level of aberrant Vβ 13 cleavage was consistently detected, especially in TCR transgenic P 13 R/R mice. These findings suggest that the variable gene promoter is required for promoting local recombination accessibility of the associated Vβ gene segment. Although the promoter is dispensable for <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion,</b> it appears to suppress aberrant Vβ cleavages during <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion...</b>|$|E
40|$|As {{members of}} the {{adaptive}} immune response, T- and B- cells express unique antigen receptors generated from antigen receptor loci. These loci encode multiple Variable (V), Diversity (D), and Joining (J) gene segments. Through {{a process known as}} V(D) J recombination, genomic rearrangements occur to generate a unique antigen receptor proteins. During each stage of lymphocyte development, antigen receptor loci are epigenetically regulated. The epigenetic regulation promotes and inhibits V(D) J recombination through different mechanisms. To generate an antigen receptor protein, the substrates for rearrangement (recombination signal sequences, RSSs) must be made accessible to the recombination machinery. Moreover, once an antigen receptor locus has rearranged and produced a successful in-frame protein, a mechanism known as <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> prevents further recombination. The nucleosome can positively and negatively regulate V(D) J recombination. Therefore, we defined the in vivo nucleosome organization of accessible and inaccessible RSSs on the Tcr loci. We used Tcrb and Tcra alleles which lack various cis-elements (e. g. enhancers and promoters) and terminate transcription. By comparing nucleosome organization and histone octamer occupancy, we found that accessible alleles are characterized by lower histone octamer occupancy and in some cases movement of nucleosomes. Also, we found that some these changes are mediated by transcription through the RSS. We concluded that one mechanism by which cis-elements epigenetically regulate RSS accessibility is by histone octamer loss and nucleosome repositioning and that some of these changes are mediated by transcription. In addition, we further investigated how <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> prevents Tcrb locus recombination in CD 4, CD 8 double positive (DP) thymocytes. A previous study had introduced the Tcra enhancer (Eα) {{into the middle of the}} Tcrb locus to test if <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> was mediated solely by RSS accessibility. That study found that Eα could force RSS accessibility in DP thymocytes, but Vβ RSS accessibility did not overcome additional mechanisms involved in <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion.</b> One potential mechanism that has been suggested in the literature is changes in locus conformation. Thus, we tested if RSS accessibility and locus conformation together mediate <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion.</b> We generated two alleles that overcome changes in RSS accessibility, due to the presence of Eα and that overcome changes in locus conformation, due to a decrease in distance between Vβ and DJβ RSSs. We found that both alleles are accessible in DP thymocytes and we detected Vβ to DJβ recombination in DP thymocytes. Therefore, the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate Tcrb <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> consists of changes in RSS accessibility and changes in locus conformation. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of diverse antibodies in B cells {{is the end}} result of the combinatorial rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes. However, given the choice of two immunoglobulin heavy or light chain alleles, a functional rearrangement occurs only on one allele at a given time, and B cells subsequently express surface receptors with a single specificity, a phenomenon termed <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion.</b> Although it has been a subject of intensive research, the exact mechanisms for the establishment of <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> are yet to be fully understood. In this study, we provide evidence suggesting that E 47 might be involved in the differential accessibility of two immunoglobulin kappa light chain alleles. Using the combination of biarsenical-tetracysteine (TC) labeling system and 3 D fluorescence in situ hybridization (3 D FISH) to visualize E 47 and the IgK locus, we demonstrate that the association of E 47 with the IgK intronic/ 3 ʹ enhancers in pro-B and pre -B cells is predominantly monoallelic. Furthermore, the analysis of the spatial distances between the distal VK region and the IgK enhancers among pro-B and pre-B cells showing monoallelic E 47 binding revealed that the E 47 - bound IgK alleles are in a more compact state than the non -E 47 -bound IgK alleles. In addition, E 47 association correlates with a more central subnuclear localization of the IgK locus. Hence, our findings suggest that the monoallelic interaction of trans-acting factors such as E 47 and cis-acting regulatory DNA elements might contribute to the establishment of <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> at the IgK locus by creating differential locus environments. These findings may provide valuable insight into the potential universal mechanism for <b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> during lymphocyte development in genera...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe pre-B cell {{receptor}} triggers expansion and differentiation of pre-B cells (the pre-B cell transition), {{as well as}} inhibition of VH to DJH recombination (<b>allelic</b> <b>exclusion).</b> The latter also accounts for counter-selection of pro-B cells expressing Dμ protein (Dμ selection). However, the signaling pathways responsible for these events remain poorly defined. Here we show complete arrest of B cell development at the pre-B cell transition in BASH/CD 19 double mutant mice, indicating partial redundancy of the two B cell-specific adaptors. <b>Allelic</b> <b>exclusion</b> remained intact in the double mutant mice, whereas Dμ selection was abolished in BASH mutant mice. Thus, distinct signals are required for these events. In addition, both mutant mice succumbed to pre-B cell leukemia, indicating that BASH and CD 19 contribute to tumor suppression...|$|E
