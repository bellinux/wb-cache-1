5000|$|After {{a period}} of rumors and anticipation, Sony Music CEO Doug Morris {{confirmed}} on June 7, 2015, that Apple had plans to announce a music streaming service, saying [...] "It's happening tomorrow", with launch later in the month. Morris emphasized several times that he prefers paid streaming as opposed to ad-supported, from a financial perspective. Furthermore, Morris said he expects the service to be the [...] "tipping point" [...] to accelerate the growth of streaming, along with arguing that Apple has [...] "$178 billion dollars in the bank. And they have 800 million credit cards in iTunes." [...] as opposed to Spotify, which [...] "never really advertised because it’s never been profitable". Morris further argued that [...] "Apple will promote this like crazy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> have a halo effect on the streaming business. A rising tide will lift all boats. It's {{the beginning of an}} amazing moment for our industry".|$|E

5000|$|Regarding the {{legality}} of the order, Peter Spiro indicated in an interview that there's a possibility that even if the courts accept the plenary power of the president, they will strike down the executive order on an equal protection basis. Although the Trump administration argues that the executive order serves some kind of counterterrorism purpose, the courts, according to Spiro, will see this argument as irrational. He cites the [...] "more than a thousand foreign service officers" [...] that say that the order does [...] "not advance any counter-terror objective that it actually detracts from national security values." [...] Furthermore, the heartbreaking human stories of immigrants and refugees affected by the order will {{play a role in the}} courts' rulings. In the same interview, Anil Kalhan of the Thomas R. Kline School of Law agreed with Spiro's reasoning and added, [...] "It is so clear that the order was not appropriately vetted within the executive branch before it was issued, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> offend judicial sensibilities." [...] Kalhan also said that he thinks that the protests against the order may convince the courts that they are acting in concert with public support and will therefore not have to worry about risking the court's legitimacy by not deferring to the executive branch. Both Spiro and Kalhan view the executive order as unconstitutional.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{warnings}} of the Bureau of Equipment, the War Department, the Department of Labor and Commerce, and the Department of Agriculture had secured permission {{to settle on}} the naval reservation. By 1906, the Commandant {{believed that it was}} necessary for the Bureau of Yards and Docks to develop a policy {{on the future of the}} station. The docks were being used to a greater extent by the Army transports, than by Navy ships, and the Army was actually attempting to get possession of Quarantine Wharf (which was built by the Territorial Government on the Naval Reservation, with the understanding that it could be taken over at any time by the Navy Department upon the payment of its appraised value.) In 1903, the Department of Labor and Commerce received about 7 acre for an Immigration Station. The Department of Agriculture had, in the meanwhile, secured part of the site intended for a hospital as an experimental station. The Commandant felt that, if the station was going to develop beyond a mere coaling depot, these territorial encroachments on the part of other departments should be stopped, particularly when they were enjoying the benefits of naval appropriations. [...] "On the other hand," [...] he wrote, [...] "if it is the intention to improve Pearl Harbor and eventually abandon this station every effort should be made to begin work there as soon as possible... I am informed that important commercial interests will make a strong effort next year to have Pearl Harbor improved, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> be an opportune time for the Navy Department to make efforts in the same direction." ...|$|E
40|$|As I {{near the}} {{completion}} of my undergraduate degree in Architecture, I am often asked if architecture is my future. I typically reply, "I don't know," and then continue with, "what I {{really need to do}} is design and build something — no bigger than a shed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> be the litmus test for my future as an architect or designer. " I sense the need to move from 1 / 8 " = 1 '- 0 " to 1 " = 1 ". The full-scale world is all I am concerned with. It is a world that was utterly neglected in my studies as an architecture student. Last autumn, alongside my Dad and a family friend, I helped assemble a Sears backyard shed that came as a kit of parts waiting to be formed into floors, walls and a roof. This particular kit of parts must have sat in our garage for over a year, but the pieces went up willingly enough, as it was only daylong project. Having followed the directions and making sure the end result looked as the diagrams indicated, we assumed we now had a shed to last. But, Kalamazoo — where my parents reside — is accustomed to regular snowfall in the winter months. The Sears shed must not have been designed for such regular snowfall, because within three months of assembling the shed, nature disassembled it, collapsing the roof {{under the weight of the}} snow. My opportunity had arrived. The following is a log documenting the construction of a new backyard shed. For most, a humble project; for me, a project infused with sentiment and introspection, concepts of beauty and ethics, and a chance to turn from a critic to a creator. Oh, to most who ever see this shed it will appear as nothing more than any familiar organization of brick and metal, a proper orientation of walls and a roof - nothing to even mark a memory in one's mind. But, I don't build for them. Honors College"December 13, 2010. "Thesis (B. ?. ...|$|E
