50|$|Angiography or <b>arteriography</b> is {{a medical}} imaging {{technique}} used to visualize the inside, or lumen, of blood vessels and organs of the body, with particular interest in the arteries, veins, and the heart chambers.

50|$|Loin pain-hematuria {{syndrome}} (LPHS) is {{a poorly}} defined disorder characterized by recurrent or persistent loin (flank) pain and hematuria {{that appears to}} represent glomerular bleeding. Most patients present with both manifestations, but some present with loin pain or hematuria alone. Pain episodes are rarely associated with low-grade fever and dysuria, but urinary tract infection is not present. The major causes of flank pain and hematuria, such as nephrolithiasis and blood clot, are typically not present. Renal <b>arteriography</b> may suggest focally impaired cortical perfusion, while renal biopsy may show interstitial fibrosis and arterial sclerosis.|$|E

50|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) {{has become}} the diagnostic modality of choice for head trauma due to its accuracy, reliability, safety, and wide availability. The changes in microcirculation, impaired auto-regulation, cerebral edema, and axonal injury start as soon as head injury occurs and manifest as clinical, biochemical, and radiological changes. Proper therapeutic management of brain injury is based on correct diagnosis and appreciation of the temporal course of the disease process. CT scan detects and precisely localizes the intracranial hematomas, brain contusions, edema and foreign bodies. Because of the widespread availability of CT, there is reduction in <b>arteriography,</b> surgical intervention and skull radiography.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s Stanford University marked a {{landmark}} period in particle physics {{research with the}} creation of the colliding beam storage ring, called the Stanford Positron Electron Accelerating Ring (SPEAR) in 1972. Among the famous discoveries were the J/psi and tau particles. A byproduct of the ring's operation was an intense beam of synchrotron radiation. Rubenstein and his colleagues E. Barrie Hughes and Robert Hofstadter posited that there may be numerous applications of this intensely powerful, tuneable, and linearly polarized radiation to biomedical imaging, including intravenous coronary <b>arteriography.</b> They devised a synchrotron radiation based imaging system which has been used worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|Doppler <b>arteriography,</b> with probes at the {{fingertips}} and arms, tests {{the force and}} [...] "smoothness" [...] of the blood flow through the radial arteries, with and without having the patient perform various arm maneuvers (which causes compression of the subclavian artery at the thoracic outlet). The movements can elicit symptoms of pain and numbness and produce graphs with diminished arterial blood flow to {{the fingertips}}, providing strong evidence of impingement of the subclavian artery at the thoracic outlet. Doppler <b>arteriography</b> does not utilize probes at the fingertips and arms, and in this case is likely being confused with plethysmography, which is a different method that utilizes ultrasound without direct visualization of the affected vessels. It {{should also be noted that}} Doppler ultrasound (not really 'arteriography') would not be used at the radial artery in order to make the diagnosis of TOS. Finally, even if a Doppler study of the appropriate artery were to be positive, it would not diagnose neurogenic TOS, by far the most common subtype of TOS. There is plenty of evidence in the medical literature to show that arterial compression does not equate to brachial plexus compression, although they may occur together, in varying degrees. Additionally, arterial compression by itself does not make the diagnosis of arterial TOS (the rarest form of TOS). Lesser degrees of arterial compression have been shown in normal individuals in various arm positions and are thought to be of little significance without the other criteria for arterial TOS.|$|E

50|$|Subsequently, Rentrop's {{associate}} Cohen prospectively evaluated 23 patients undergoing PTCA {{and observed}} that during balloon inflation, the mean grade of collateral filling increased dramatically. Nineteen of 23 patients showed improvement (p=0.01) but post-PTCA <b>arteriography</b> revealed no visible collaterals in any patient. The functional effect of filling was dramatic: using {{an index of}} ischemia (based on the percent of hypocontractile perimeter of myocardium, sum of ST segment elevation, and time of onset of angina), Cohen found that grade 0 or 1 filling confers only nominal protection from ischemia (i.e., filling is non-existent or of side branches only), but partial filling (i.e. grade 2 or greater) of these segments provides almost complete preservation of the affected myocardium from the asynergy associated with critical coronary stenosis. Pain was observed in all nine patients with 0 or 1 filling, but in only five of 14 patients with grade 2 or 3 filling. Thus, the severity of symptoms correlated inversely with the degree of observed collateral filling.|$|E
5000|$|Tissue biopsy is {{the gold}} standard. Macroscopically this reveals pale muscle tissue. Microscopically infarcted patches of myocytes. Necrotic muscle fibers are swollen and eosinophilic and lack {{striations}} and nuclei. Small-vessel walls are thickened and hyalinized, with luminal narrowing or complete occlusion. Biopsy cultures for bacteria, fungi, acid-fast bacilli and stains are negative in simple myonecrosis. Creatine kinase may be normal or increased probably {{depending upon the}} stage of the condition when sampling is undertaken. ESR is elevated. Planar X-ray reveals soft tissue swelling and may potentially show gas within necrotic muscle, Bone scan may show non specific uptake later in the course. CT shows muscle oedema with preserved tissue planes (non-contrast enhancing). MRI is the exam of choice and shows increased signal on T2 weighted images within areas of muscle oedema. Contrast enhancement is helpful but must be weighed against the risk of Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis as many diabetics have underlying renal insufficiency. <b>Arteriography</b> reveals large and medium vessel arteriosclerosis occasionally with dye within the area of tissue infarction [...] Electromyography shows non specific focal changes.|$|E
50|$|Some {{articles}} {{suggested that}} over 60 persons examined with Omniscan had either died {{or had been}} severely disabled {{as a result of}} the use of the product. However, a recent report by the Danish Medicines Agency stated that there were 35 cases of NSF reported after use of Omniscan and that 33 of these had been reported from a single centre in Copenhagen.However, already in 2001, a case of renal toxicity and pancreatitis associated with Omniscan use for <b>arteriography</b> had been reported. In their paper, the authors also referred to two other previous case reports (1998 and 1999) of acute renal failure after gadoteridol (Prohance) intraarterially and acute pancreatitis after intravenous gadolinium-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (Magnevist). A case of cardiac arrest has also been reported. Gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist) was administered during an MR study of the head, and from the rapid onset of signs and symptoms and subsequent cardiovascular arrest, a cause-and-effect relationship was suggested. In the interest of public health, it seems important that not only renal disease should be considered a factor when decisions about the use of this kind of MRI contrast is taken.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to determine if patients with an echocardiographic diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy should be submitted to coronary <b>arteriography.</b> BACKGROUND: Whether echocardiography allows distinction of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy from severe coronary heart disease remains controversial. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent out {{to the members of the}} Swiss Society of Cardiology. In the first study 78 patients with an echocardiographic diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who had undergone coronary <b>arteriography</b> or had been followed-up for > 5 years were investigated. In a second study, the echocardiograms of 50 patients with either idiopathic cardiomyopathy or severe coronary heart disease, all of whom had also undergone coronary <b>arteriography,</b> were reviewed by two independent echocardiographers without access to any complementary information. RESULT: The questionnaire revealed that one half of the Swiss cardiologists generally refer such patients for coronary <b>arteriography.</b> The first study showed that the diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy was confirmed in all cases, in which the echocardiographer had been certain of the diagnosis (64 / 78 [82 %]). In the uncertain cases (14 [18 %]) coronary <b>arteriography</b> revealed 9 idiopathic cardiomyopathies, 3 coronary heart diseases, and 2 mixed etiologies. The second study showed that a correct diagnosis was achieved in 85 % of cases. Furthermore, the echocardiographers were able to specify those patients with an uncertain diagnosis who would therefore require coronary <b>arteriography.</b> CONCLUSIONS: In the overwhelming majority of cases, echocardiography can distinguish idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy from severe coronary heart disease. Coronary <b>arteriography</b> is only indicated when the echocardiographer is uncertain of the diagnosis. The routine and costly practice of coronary <b>arteriography</b> of these patients does not appear to be justified...|$|E
