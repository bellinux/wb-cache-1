The methodological approach combined {{a review of the}} contemporary literature on ‘emotion' work with exploratory primary research involving longitudinal focus groups and ‘life history' interviews (Ladkin 2004) with purposively selected respondents. The findings suggested that intensifying job demands and deteriorating working conditions continue to increase the alienating psychological costs of performing emotional labour for <b>air</b> <b>cabin</b> crew. These costs appear greater where ‘emotional reciprocity' is absent and emotional dissonance is evident. Some crew, however, continue to make emotional effort autonomously and spontaneously, and these incidences appear linked to personality trait characteristics and positive service orientation. This work offers a rounded contextualization of respondents' life experiences with their emotional self-management challenges at work. Future research could further explore the ‘reciprocity dynamic' as an enabler of service agents' emotional self-management.

40|$|Corrosion {{has been}} one of the most serious safety {{problems}} in aviation, and the most costly maintenance problem. Contributing to the problematic nature of corrosion is the complexity of its mechanisms and the randomness with which it occurs. The reliability of a structure affected by corrosion is normally based on the forms of the erosion and its severity. Existing research in this area has a primary focus on corrosion induced structure failure due to inadequate residual structural strength. However, it is valuable to recognise that some product failures induced by corrosion are not critically dependent on stress or fatigue-examples include such cases as leakage from oil pipe or containers, leakage into <b>air</b> <b>cabin</b> and landing floats and, or degradation of a high smooth surface required structure. In such cases non-structural failure should be judged on some specific failure criterion involving the number of corrosion spots, as well as their surface area, depth and distribution. Based on data collected from inspection and maintenance records of the Chinese Yunshu- 7 passenger aircraft, this paper will propose some new concepts formulation of relevant failure criteria and will propose corrosion probabilistic models for reliability assessment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMany {{previous}} studies have mentioned the critical effect of natural convection caused by passengers heat transfer on the air distribution inside the air cabins, but No study focused on it to make a further experimental or numerical analysis. In fact, the air flow field inside the <b>air</b> <b>cabin</b> with narrow interior space and passengers seated intensively {{is the result of}} interaction between natural convection from the passengers and forced convection from the supply air diffusers, including the air jet which plays the most essential part on the flow pattern. This study has measured the air flow jet in a 7 -row cabin mockup with 2 D-PIV (two dimension Particle Image Velocity) measurement system, and to make comparison of the air jet under isothermal and cooling conditions to analyze qualitatively the impact of natural convection inside the cabin mockup, which is to increase the air jet entrainment and weaken the attaching effect which can also enhance the velocity distribution uniformity. With the variety of air flow volume in a reasonable range of design parameters, we measured the different air velocity fields to quantify the effects of natural convection on the air jet. It can be concluded that the air jet decay rate becomes slower with the enhancement of natural convection...|$|E
40|$|The {{microbial}} {{burdens of}} 69 cabin air samples collected from commercial airliners were assessed via conventional culture-dependent, and molecular-based microbial enumeration assays. Cabin air samples {{from each of}} four separate flights aboard two different carriers were collected via air-impingement. Microbial enumeration techniques targeting DNA, ATP, and endotoxin were employed to estimate total microbial burden. The total viable microbial population ranged from 0 to 3. 6 x 10 4 cells per 100 liters of air, as assessed by the ATP-assay. When these same samples were plated on R 2 A minimal medium, anywhere from 2 % to 80 % of these viable populations were cultivable. Five of the 29 samples examined exhibited higher cultivable counts than ATP derived viable counts, perhaps {{a consequence of the}} dormant nature (and thus lower concentration of intracellular ATP) of cells inhabiting these <b>air</b> <b>cabin</b> samples. Ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis showed these samples to consist of a moderately diverse group of bacteria, including human pathogens. Enumeration of ribosomal genes via quantitative-PCR indicated that population densities ranged from 5 x 10 1 ' to IO 7 cells per 100 liters of air.

The {{research}} investigated Work Schedule Stress {{experienced by}} female <b>air</b> <b>cabin</b> attendants (CAs) employed by South African Airways {{and its relationship}} to health variables in CAs. Specifically, it was hypothesised that Work Schedule Stress is an important stressor for CAs and is inversely related to health variables. Furthermore, the variables of Potency, Trait Anxiety, Trait Anger, and Social Support were proposed to moderate the relationship between Work Schedule Stress and the health variables. Data were collected from a sample of 108 domestic crew and 43 international crew. The data collection was conducted in two phases, via interviews and self-report inventories. The interview data were used in a qualitative study but were also content-analysed in terms of a number of dimensions; the latter were included with the quantitative data obtained from the questionnaire. The qualitative analysis, based on the grounded theory approach, formed the backbone of the research. The quantitative data were subjected to correlational analysis, supplemented by subgroup analysis to assess moderator effects. Work Schedule Stress was demonstrated to represent a major stress for CAs with consequent adverse effects on health. The results did not provide support for the moderating effects.

40|$|Parking {{a vehicle}} {{under the sun}} {{for a short period}} of time can rapidly {{increase}} the interior <b>air</b> <b>cabin</b> temperature no matter in clear sky days or even in partially cloudy days. These circumstances can be anxieties to car occupants upon entry. The aim of this paper is to evaluate experimentally the effect of solar reflective cover (SRC) on vehicle air temperature and cabin thermal comfort. Experimental measurements of parked cars were conducted in UKM, Bangi city, Malaysia (latitude of 2. 9 ° N and longitude of 101. 78 ° E) under partially cloudy day where average ambient temperature is 33 °C. The experimental measurements cover the following cases: case (I) : car with/ without SRC (at different measurement time); Case (II) : using two identical cars concurrently (SRC versus baseline); Case (III) : using two identical cars concurrently (solar reflective film (SRF) versus baseline) and Case (IV) : using two identical cars concurrently (SRF versus SRC). Experimental results dedicated to case (I) revealed that the maximum cabin air temperature with SRC (39. 6 °C) is significantly lower than that of baseline case (57. 3 °C). This leads to temperature reduction improvement of 31 % and the difference between the cabin and the ambient air temperature was minimized by approximately 73 %. In addition, the results revealed that the air temperature at breath level of car with SRC dropped to comfort temperature (27 °C) after 7 min while baseline car reached comfort temperature after 14 min. Results of the other cases are discussed inside the paper. Overall, it is learned that SRC is found superior as an efficient thermal insulation system limits solar radiation transmission into the cabin through the glass; keeps cabin air temperature close to the ambient temperature; and provide acceptable thermal environment to the occupants as they settle into their parked car...|$|E
40|$|Finding {{advanced}} filtration {{and separation}} solutions is often {{critical for the}} development of highly efficient and reliable products and tools, as well as for ensuring a high quality of life. In fact, it is difficult to find an industry where filters do not play an important role. A car, for example, contains filters for transmission fluid, fuel, engine <b>air,</b> <b>cabin</b> air, coolant, and brake fluid. Furthermore, the quality of our drinking water, the treatment of wastewater, and the air we breathe all depend critically on filtration solutions. The filtration and purification business is expanding greatly, with scores of large companies and thousands of SMEs competing fiercely to develop better filters. Industrial demand for innovative filtration solutions is growing rapidly, along with a more intensive usage of Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) in filter design processes. Comprehensive mathematical studies need to be carried out to provide engineers with proper CAE tools and approaches. The solid-liquid and solid-gas separation processes discussed in this chapter are intrinsically multiscale, multiphysics processes. Dust particle and pore size in filter media may vary from the sub-micron scale to hundreds of microns, while a filter element may range from several centimeters to several meters in size. Depending on the operating conditions and the material properties, the filter media may behave as a rigid body or be deformable. This chapter provides an overview of the industrial and mathematical challenges in modeling and simulating filtration processes, along with a summary of the basic achievements of the Fraunhofer ITWM in this area. Approaches for the microscale (pore scale) and macroscale (filter element scale) investigation of filtration processes are discussed in detail, along with a recently developed method for treating the coupled multiscale filtration problem. Software tools developed in the last decade are described. Finally, some success stories are presented to illustrate the potential of industrial mathematics for solving practical problems...|$|E
