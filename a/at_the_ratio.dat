2500|$|Series b however, {{completely}} refutes {{the basic}} concepts of empiricism. It begins by declaring that [...] "Mans perceptions are not bounded by organs of perception, he perceives more than sense (thou' ever so acute) can discover." [...] As such, Man can indeed discover aspects beyond his own immediate experience; [...] "Reason or {{the ratio of}} all we have already known. {{is not the same}} as it shall be when we know more." [...] Blake points out that Man is fundamentally desirous of discovering more and moving beyond the bounds of his specific physicality, which is nothing more than a restriction; [...] "The bounded is loathed by its possessor." [...] As a result, Man yearns to know that which he does not yet know because [...] "Less than all cannot satisfy Man." [...] However, Man should never desire more than he can possess, because [...] "if any could desire what he is incapable of possessing, despair must be his eternal lot." [...] However, because Man tends to desire the infinite, thus [...] "the desire of Man being Infinite the possession is Infinite & himself Infinite." [...] That is to say, if Man can only desire what he can possess, yet he desires the infinite, then he must be able to possess the infinite. Blake takes from this that if Man's desires and possessions can be infinite, then Man too must be Infinite, and, by extension, Man can see the Infinite. Indeed, not to see the Infinite is a perversion of Man's true nature, as defined by the Poetic Genius; [...] "If it were not for the Poetic or Prophetic character. the Philosophic & Experimental would soon be <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ratio</b> of all things & stand still, unable to do other than repeat the same dull round over again"; i.e. Man is made to do more than perceive and experience through the senses only. Furthermore, to see the Infinite is to see God, which is to transcend the sensate ("the Ratio"); [...] "He who sees the Infinite in all things sees God. He who sees the Ratio only sees himself only." [...] Therefore, for Man to see God, he must be as God, and as such, [...] "God becomes as we are that we may be as he is." ...|$|E
