5|$|First rescue efforts {{came from}} {{surviving}} neighbours and co-workers who pulled and dug out victims from buildings.

A flood of victims soon began {{to arrive at the}} city's hospitals, which were quickly overwhelmed. The new military hospital, Camp Hill, admitted approximately 1400 victims on 6 December.|$|E

5|$|The content {{ranges from}} {{extremely}} difficult algebra and pre-calculus problems to problems on branches of mathematics not conventionally covered {{at school and}} often not at university level either, such as projective and complex geometry, functional equations and well-grounded number theory, of which extensive knowledge of theorems is required. Calculus, though allowed in solutions, is never required, {{as there is a}} principle that <b>anyone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> basic understanding of mathematics should understand the problems, even if the solutions require a great deal more knowledge. Supporters of this principle claim that this allows more universality and creates an incentive to find elegant, deceptively simple-looking problems which nevertheless require a certain level of ingenuity.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{local governments}} {{assisted}} the affected storm victims by providing food, water, and clothing, even traveling by canoe to distribute aid. However, residents in Yuyao complained about insufficient assistance, {{as many people}} were without food or clean water for several days, due to ongoing flooding making distribution difficult. This sparked thousands of people to protest the government, although they dispersed after increased numbers of policemen. Residents were initially required to show food coupons to receive meals, but later <b>anyone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> residence permit could receive the meals; however, the food distribution was disorganized, and {{there were reports of}} people looting for food. By October18, the flooding in Yuyao had subsided and roadways had reopened, and power service was gradually restored. Due to the extended disruptions to the city, garbage service was halted. Two people in Yuyao were arrested after spreading false rumors online that reservoir collapsed during the storm, killing 40people.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} game, Valve has {{produced}} three machinima trailers depicting {{the game in}} play. The trailers are themed around wartime propaganda news reports for both Germany and the United States. To convey this effect, the trailers make extensive usage of the Source engine's capabilities for film grain, color correction, motion blur and depth of field, as well as sepia toning. The first trailer was released {{as part of the}} game's post-release marketing on December 20, 2005. Entitled Prelude to Victory, the trailer depicted a large firefight in the game as a report from the German perspective, complete with a commentator speaking in the German language. Two further trailers were released to promote the major update to Day of Defeat: Source {{in the second quarter of}} 2006. The trailers, both from the American viewpoint, displayed how the new detonation gameplay worked, emphasising teamwork as the key to success, as well as introducing the viewer to the two new maps added by the update. To further create interest in the game, Valve has opened Day of Defeat: Source to three free weekends, the first taking place on February 10, 2006, the second on July 8, 2006 and the third on July 4, 2008, where <b>anyone</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Steam account could download and play the game for a maximum of 48 hours free of charge.|$|E
