5|$|In September 1941, Allison {{joined the}} S-1 Section, which coordinated the early {{investigations}} into the feasibility of an atomic bomb. He began building a reactor in the squash courts under the disused stands of Stagg Field. He became head of the Metallurgical Laboratory's chemistry section in January 1942, and in March, his small experimental reactor using beryllium came closer to criticality than the graphite-moderated design of Enrico Fermi's group at Columbia University. During 1942, Compton brought <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> groups working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design at Columbia University, Princeton University and the University of California together at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Allison was placed {{in charge of the}} experimental work.|$|E
25|$|All his {{scientific}} career, Changeux has been faithful {{to a handful}} of scientific questions, at molecular, cellular and brain levels. If one needs to seek a unifying theme to all of them, it is the conviction that selection is the basis of life processes, rather than instruction. While started as separate lines of investigations, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> threads were tied in the recent decades within the study of allosteric mechanisms as a basis of for the involvement of nicotinic receptors in cognitive functions.|$|E
25|$|Two {{important}} {{classes of}} claytronics algorithms are shape sculpting and localization algorithms. The {{ultimate goal of}} claytronics research is creating dynamic motion in three-dimensional poses. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> on catom motion, collective actuation and hierarchical motion planning require shape sculpting algorithms to convert catoms into the necessary structure, which will give structural strength and fluid movement to the dynamic ensemble. Meanwhile, localization algorithms enable catoms to localize their positions in an ensemble. A localization algorithm should provide accurate relational knowledge of catoms to the whole matrix based on noisy observation in a fully distributed manner.|$|E

25|$|Edison's work on rubber {{took place}} largely at his botanic {{research}} laboratory in Fort Myers, {{which has been}} designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark. The laboratory was built after Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone pulled together $75,000 to form the Edison Botanical Research Corporation. Initially, only Ford and Firestone were to contribute funds to the project while Edison did <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>research.</b> Edison, however, wished to contribute $25,000 as well. After testing over 17,000 plant species, Edison decided on Solidago leavenworthii, also known as Leavenworth's Goldenrod. The plant, which normally grows roughly 3–4 feet tall with a 5% latex yield, was adapted by Edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12%.|$|E
25|$|The one {{tangible}} {{result that}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> continually focused {{on is that}} community-based services, such as those provided by the HCBS waiver programs, provided a higher {{quality of life for}} disabled individuals. It can also be argued that the research upholds the idea that the cost per individual was lower for those enrolled in the HCBS waiver program than for those attending institutions for similar services. The difficulty when collecting research and data for programs with fewer years of operation is concrete evidence for sufficient analysis. It is also critical {{to keep in mind that}} the HCBS waiver program varies state by state with regard to demographics, funding, state policies, and so forth. The most effective changes come as each state analyzes the overall functionality, success, and performance of their individual HCBS waiver program.|$|E
25|$|The Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, {{met with}} the President, Dwight Eisenhower, at Camp David in March 1960, and secured {{permission}} to buy Skybolt without strings attached. In return, the Americans were given permission to base the US Navy's Polaris-equipped ballistic missile submarines at the Holy Loch in Scotland. The financial arrangement was particularly favourable to Britain, as the US was charging only the unit cost of Skybolt, absorbing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> and development costs. Mountbatten was disappointed, as was Burke, who now {{had to face the}} possible survival of Skybolt at the Pentagon. Exactly what was agreed with regard to Polaris was not clear; the Americans wanted any later offer of Polaris to be as part of a scheme for deployment of NATO MRBMs known as the Multilateral Force. With the Skybolt agreement in hand, the Secretary of State for Defence, Harold Watkinson, announced the cancellation of Blue Streak to the House of Commons on 13 April 1960.|$|E

The idea came in to do a project with The Buena Vista Social Club to fuse their Latin sounds with Western artists and their familiar popular songs. The project evolved when more environmental disasters struck—the Asian Earthquakes and Hurricane Katrina. But the big picture was climate change. You can call these natural disasters but after <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> and scientific data, we know that we're at least partly to blame {{for some of these}} disasters.

2500|$|The MAUD Committee {{was founded}} in {{response}} to Rudolf Peierls and Otto Robert Frisch's memorandum, in March 1940. The Frisch-Peierls memorandum was {{a discussion of the}} potential military feasibility a nuclear bomb. It was purely theoretical, so the purpose of the MAUD committee was to do the research required to determine if applying nuclear technology to make a bomb was, in reality, feasible. The chair of the committee was George Thomson. Each university where research was being done had a director as well. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> finally culminated, after fifteen months, in two reports, [...] "Use of Uranium for a Bomb" [...] and [...] "Use of Uranium as a source of power", known collectively as the MAUD report. These reports discussed the necessity of a super-bomb for the war effort. In order to research this further, the British created their own nuclear program officially named Tube Alloys.|$|E
2500|$|As <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> by {{historian}} Fares Abdul Rahim and geographers {{of modern}} Palestine shows, the Arab population {{began to grow}} again {{in the middle of}} the nineteenth century. That growth resulted from a new factor: the demographic revolution. Until the 1850s there was no [...] "natural" [...] increase of the population, but this began to change when modern medical treatment was introduced and modern hospitals were established, both by the Ottoman authorities and by the foreign Christian missionaries. The number of births remained steady but infant mortality decreased. This was the main reason for Arab population growth. ... No one would doubt that some migrant workers came to Palestine from Syria and Trans-Jordan and remained there. But one has to add to this that there were migrations in the opposite direction as well. For example, a tradition developed in Hebron to go to study and work in Cairo, with the result that a permanent community of Hebronites had been living in Cairo since the fifteenth century. Trans-Jordan exported unskilled casual labor to Palestine; but before 1948 its civil service attracted a good many educated Palestinian Arabs who did not find work in Palestine itself. Demographically speaking, however, neither movement of population was significant in comparison to the decisive factor of natural increase.|$|E
6000|$|No {{wonder that}} such a spot as Torquay, with its delicious Italian climate, and endless variety of rich woodland, flowery lawn, fantastic rock-cavern, and broad bright tide-sand, {{sheltered}} from every wind of heaven except the soft south-east, should have become a favourite haunt, not only for invalids, but for naturalists. [...] Indeed, it may well claim the honour of being the original home of marine zoology and botany in England, as the Firth of Forth, {{under the auspices of}} Sir J. G. Dalyell, has been for Scotland. For here worked Montagu, Turton, and Mrs. Griffith, to whose extraordinary powers of research English marine botany almost owes its existence, and who survived to an age long beyond the natural term of man, to see, in her cheerful and honoured old age, that knowledge become popular and general which she pursued for many a year unassisted and alone. Here, too, the scientific succession is still maintained by Mr. Pengelly and Mr. Gosse, the latter of whom by his delightful and, happily, well-known books has done more for the study of marine zoology than any other living man. Torbay, moreover, from the variety of its rocks, aspects, and sea-floors, where limestones alternate with traps, and traps with slates, while at the valley-mouth the soft sandstones and hard conglomerates of the new red series slope down into the tepid and shallow waves, affords an abundance and variety of animal and vegetable life, unequalled, perhaps, in any other part of Great Britain. It cannot boast, certainly, of those strange deep-sea forms which Messrs. [...] Alder, Goodsir, and Laskey dredge among the lochs of the western Highlands, and the sub-marine mountain glens of the Zetland sea; but it has its own varieties, its own ever-fresh novelties: and in spite of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> which has been lavished on its shores, a naturalist cannot, I suspect, work there for a winter without discovering forms new to science, or meeting with curiosities which have escaped all observers, since the lynx eye of Montagu espied them full fifty years ago.|$|E
