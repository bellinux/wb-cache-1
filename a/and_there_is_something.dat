500|$|Speaking of {{the fifth}} season and Castiel's more {{frequent}} interactions with humans, Collins commented, [...] "Obviously the big joke is that he doesn't understand human beings and how they behave. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> inherently funny in that, especially if he's the straight man." [...] The actor noted {{he was a little}} hesitant at making the character into [...] "the funny guy", and was apprehensive about some moments in the early episodes of the season. However, he believes the writers have found [...] "the line", allowing for the jokes to be [...] "more subtle" [...] and [...] "a little more believable".|$|E
500|$|Ruby has a {{relationship}} with Xavier Austin (David Jones-Roberts), who initially messes her around. Ruby decides to try and win Xavier back even after her initial heartbreak, of this Breeds states: [...] "She pushes boundaries where I wouldn't {{and she has a}} lot of fun. She thinks she is so mature, but she's really young and innocent." [...] Breeds explains her attraction to Xavier as [...] "a challenge - she had to work for him <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> mysterious and naughty about him but deep down she knows he is loyal and decent." [...] Their relationship ultimately ends after they grow apart. Breeds said that Ruby and Xavier's relationship was a more [...] "beautiful friendship and really good support" [...] dynamic, rather than a romantic scenario. She also said it was [...] "lacking passion, which everyone deserves. It's there but it's not there enough." ...|$|E
500|$|From Frankensteins first {{theatrical}} adaptation in 1823 to {{the cinematic}} adaptations of the 20th century, {{including the first}} cinematic version in 1910 and now-famous versions such as James Whale's 1931 Frankenstein, Mel Brooks' 1974 Young Frankenstein, and Kenneth Branagh's 1994 Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, many audiences first encounter the work of Mary Shelley through adaptation. Over {{the course of the}} 19th century, Mary Shelley came {{to be seen as a}} one-novel author at best, rather than as the professional writer she was; most of her works have remained out of print until the last thirty years, obstructing a larger view of her achievement. In recent decades, the republication of almost all her writing has stimulated a new recognition of its value. Her habit of intensive reading and study, revealed in her journals and letters and reflected in her works, is now better appreciated. Shelley's conception of herself as an author has also been recognised; after Percy's death, she wrote of her authorial ambitions: [...] "I think that I can maintain myself, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> inspiriting in the idea." [...] Scholars now consider Mary Shelley to be a major Romantic figure, significant for her literary achievement and her political voice as a woman and a liberal.|$|E

2500|$|She {{raised her}} three {{children}} with Birley at Pelham cottage. [...] Her eldest son Rupert, who was born on 20 August 1955, studied at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. [...] In 1986, he disappeared {{off the coast of}} Togo in West Africa, where he was presumed drowned. [...] "There really is nothing worse than losing a child – <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> special about your first-born", she said, adding that, [...] "Because I was so young when Rupert was born ... we were more like good friends than mother and son." [...] Her second son Robin (b. 19 February 1958) is a businessman, whose face was disfigured as a child when he was mauled by a tigress at John Aspinall's private zoo. Having let him go near the pregnant tigress, Lady Annabel said, [...] "It was my own fault. I was, am, angry with myself." [...] Her first daughter India Jane (b. 14 January 1961), the granddaughter of society portrait painter Sir Oswald Birley, is an artist.|$|E
2500|$|Walker then played {{roles in}} several big-screen films, {{including}} {{a trio of}} westerns for Gordon Douglas: Fort Dobbs in 1958, Yellowstone Kelly in 1959, and Gold of the Seven Saints in 1961, the comedy Send Me No Flowers in 1964, the actual leading role despite being billed under Frank Sinatra in the wartime drama None but the Brave in 1965, The Night of the Grizzly in 1966, and as the meek convict Samson Posey in the war drama The Dirty Dozen in 1967. In 1969, New York Times film critic Howard Thompson, in reviewing Walker's performance in the movie More Dead Than Alive, described the actor as [...] "a big, fine-looking chap and about as live-looking as any man could be. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> winning about his taciturn earnestness as an actor, although real emotion seldom breaks through". In 1958, Thompson described the actor, then starring in Fort Dobbs, as [...] "the biggest, finest-looking Western hero ever to sag a horse, {{with a pair of}} shoulders rivaling King Kong's".|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the film}} would be shot during magic hour, which Almendros called: [...] "a euphemism, because it's not an hour but around 25 minutes at the most. It is {{the moment when the}} sun sets, and after the sun sets and before it is night. The sky has light, but there is no actual sun. The light is very soft, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> magic about it. It limited us to around twenty minutes a day, but it did pay on the screen. It gave some kind of magic look, a beauty and romanticism." [...] Lighting was {{integral}} to filming and helped evoke the painterly quality of the landscapes in the film. A vast majority of the scenes were filmed late in the afternoon or after sunset, with the sky silhouetting the actors faces, which would otherwise be difficult to see. Interior scenes that feature light coming in from the outside, were shot using artificial light to maintain the consistency of that intruding light. The [...] "magic look", however, would also extend to interior scenes, which did occasionally utilize natural light.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{track on}} the album is [...] "Manos al Aire", an uptempo dance-influenced track, which Furtado says is about [...] "having a heated argument" [...] with her love interest. During the chorus, she puts up the [...] "white flag" [...] and [...] "surrenders" [...] to him. Another song from the album entitled, [...] "Bajo Otra Luz", Furtado proclaimed, is about [...] "when {{you are in a}} {{relationship}} and you are under a light. You feel like something is glowing on you <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> different about the world. You can’t put your finger on it." [...] The seventh track, [...] "Suficiente Tiempo", is a description of the busy life of an overworked wife who is [...] "trying to make time for a date night". Furtado said that the album was [...] "purposefully collaboration-heavy" [...] because she [...] "want it to sound like a community effort. I wanted it to have all those layers of experience" [...] She also collaborated with Josh Groban on a song entitled, [...] "Silencio" [...] and called the collaboration a [...] "huge blessing." [...] She felt it was important to feature [...] "an artist that people know more for their English recordings" [...] because she wanted to demonstrate that [...] "language isn't a barrier when it comes to music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bill {{returns to}} the country mansion in his own car and is met at the gate by {{a man with a}} note warning him to cease and desist his inquiries. After reading a {{newspaper}} story about a beauty queen who died of a drug overdose, Bill views the body at the morgue and identifies it as Mandy. [...] Bill is summoned to Ziegler's house, where he is confronted with {{the events of the past}} night and day. Ziegler was one of those involved with the ritual orgy, and identified Bill and his connection with Nick. Ziegler claims that he had Bill followed for his own protection, and that the warnings made against Bill by the society are only intended to scare him from speaking about the orgy. However, he implies the society is capable of acting on their threats. Bill asks about the death of Mandy, whom Ziegler has identified as the masked woman at the party who'd [...] "sacrificed" [...] herself to prevent Bill's punishment, and about the disappearance of Nick, the piano player. Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back at his home in Seattle. Ziegler also says the [...] "punishment" [...] was a charade by the secret society to further frighten Bill, and it had nothing to do with Mandy's death; she was a hooker and addict and had died from another accidental drug overdose. Bill does not know if Ziegler is telling him the truth about Nick's disappearance or Mandy's death, but he says nothing further. When he returns home, Bill finds the rented mask on his pillow next to his sleeping wife. He breaks down in tears and decides to tell Alice the whole truth of the past two days. The next morning, they go Christmas shopping with their daughter. Alice muses that they should be grateful that they have survived, that she loves him <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> they must do as soon as possible. When Bill asks what it is, she replies, [...] "Fuck".|$|E

6000|$|... "I believe you, Shadow. Your {{being out}} {{is what has}} made you so tired lately. Now you have told me a secret, I am {{going to tell you}} one.

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said {{my mother}} hesitatingly.
