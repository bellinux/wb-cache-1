40|$|Abstract: Tubular light guides {{transport}} daylight into internal windowless {{parts in}} buildings via multi-reflections on highly reflective surface. They consist of roof dome of glass or transparent plastics, metal hollow core light pipe with mirrored internal surfaces and ceiling cover from diffusive glass which scatters daylight into interior. The investigation of light effi-ciency {{of these new}} systems of tubular light guides needs correct data of transmittance of transparent roof domes and ceiling covers of these systems. <b>Angular</b> <b>transmittance</b> of curved glasses and glasses with pattern are not available. A method for de-termination of <b>angular</b> <b>transmittance</b> of transparent components of light guides was set up. The method is based illuminance measurements within an experimental box with glass samples. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses inverse adding-doubling (IAD) {{method and}} Monte Carlo method for the {{simulation}} of the spectral <b>angular</b> <b>transmittance</b> {{of a novel}} kind of thermotropic material at different temperatures. The {{results show that the}} collimated light takes the major part {{at the beginning of the}} switching process and the scattered light is negligible. However, the scattered light increased to high above 80 % of the total transmitted light with the largest angle distribution of scattered light about 30 degrees as temperature elevated...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a fast, yet {{accurate}} method {{to estimate the}} spectral and angular distribution of the scattered radiation of a fluorescent material is described. The proposed method {{is an extension of}} the adding-doubling algorithm for non-fluorescent samples. The method is validated by comparing the spectral and <b>angular</b> <b>transmittance</b> and reflectance characteristics obtained with the extended algorithm with the results obtained using Monte Carlo simulations. The agreement using both methods is within 2 %. However, the adding-doubling method achieves a reduction of the calculation time by a factor of 400. Due to the short calculation time, the extended adding-doubling method is very useful when fluorescent layers have to be optimized in an iterative process. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Composite {{films with}} an array of {{needle-like}} TiO 2 particles in urethane resin matrix were fabricated by applying a 1 kHz AC bias with a square wave. In the resulting film, needle-like TiO 2 particles were arrayed in the composite films in a direction normal to the film surface. The composite films showed <b>angular</b> dependence of <b>transmittance</b> in the visible-NIR range. For the composite film with arrayed 0. 1 vol% TiO 2 needle-like particles, the transmittance changed by 16. 6 % between 0 ° and 60 ° at a wavelength of 500 nm...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} results of {{experiments}} conducted to determine optical and mechanical properties of tissue mimicking phantoms that are designed for optical elastography. In optical elastography the readout mechanism for displacement is optical, and the mechanical and optical properties of the phantom are to be tailored to match those of the tissue being imaged. The optical characterization is based on diffusive nature of light propagation including scattering anisotropy and boundary reflection. The anisotropy factor (g) is measured using a relatively thin sample (where single scattering assumption is valid) through experimentally measuring the <b>angular</b> intensity <b>transmittance.</b> The measured intensity distributions are fitted to, known theoretically available intensity distributions, which have scattering anisotropy (g) {{as one of the}} parameters, to extract g. The scattering coefficient (µS) and refractive index (n) are obtained using a thicker slab (multiple scattering regime) from where angle-resolved intensity transmittance is measured. Computed intensity distributions using Monte-Carlo(MC) simulations are curve fitted to extract 'µs' and 'n' which are used in the Monte-Carlo simulation. The visco-elastic properties such as frequency dependent elastic and loss moduli of the phantom are determined by measuring the complex modulus using a dynamic mechanical analyzing system...|$|R
40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{choice of}} the type of glazing and glazed area in a façade depends on many factors. They include amongst other criteria: location, orientation, climatic condition, energetic efficiency, usage of the building, required user comfort, and the architectural concept. All requirements cannot be fulfilled at all times and priorities have to be set to find a compromise between occupant comfort, design objective, cost and energetic efficiency. An innovative glazing system combining daylighting, glare protection, seasonal thermal control and clear view was developed [1] and patented by the authors. This design was developed using a novel ray tracing approach to obtain a strongly angular dependent transmission with a specific angular distribution. Taking advantage of the changing elevation of the sun between seasons, a seasonal variation is created by a strongly <b>angular</b> dependent <b>transmittance.</b> In this paper we present the mixed dimensionality approach used to achieve a very fast and accurate ray tracing of any lamellar structure that has a two dimensional profile. The originality of the presented Monte Carlo algorithm is the separation of intersection and interaction. Intersections are computed using only the two dimensions of the profile thereb...|$|R
40|$|A 4 + 1 -beam optical {{interference}} holography technique, {{with four}} linearly polarized side beams arranged symmetrically around a circularly polarized central beam, {{was used to}} fabricate woodpile structures in holographic gelatin emulsions. The gelatin samples, particularly in three dimensions, were more uniform than those recorded using polymeric photoresists because of the self-supporting property of the gelatin. The gelatin woodpile samples exhibited clear directional stop bands in the <b>angular</b> <b>transmittance</b> measurements. Furthermore, by exploiting the swelling property of the gelatin, {{we were able to}} tune these directional stop bands by the amount of swelling. We also modeled the angular dependence of the stop bands by the reflections of the parallel layers inside the woodpile samples and good agreement with the experimental results was obtained...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to explore how the geometry of trees in forest stands influences the reflectance of the forest as imaged from space. Most plant canopy modeling has viewed the canopy as an assemblage of plane-parallel layers on top of a soil surface. For these models, leaf angle distribution, leaf area index, and the <b>angular</b> <b>transmittance</b> and reflectance of leaves are the primary optical and geometric parameters. Such models are now sufficiently well developed to explain most of the variance in angular reflectance measurements observed from homogeneous plant canopies. However, forest canopies as imaged by airborne and spaceborne scanners exhibit considerable variance at quite a different scale. Brightness values vary strongly from one pixel to the next primarily {{as a function of the}} number of trees they contain. At this scale, the forest canopy is nonuniform and discontinuous. This research focuses on a discrete-element, geometric-optical view of the forest canopy...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the poor optical angular properties displayed by the majority of automatically darkening welding filters currently on the market that are based on liquid crystal technology. It is shown that by reducing the twist-angle present in the liquid crystal cell to below that of 90 together with employment of a novel polariser arrangement, an optical shutter design based on a double-cell construction is obtained that boasts a reduced <b>angular</b> <b>transmittance</b> variation when in the activated phase. This gives an optical filter possessing a wide central viewing cone whilst maintaining the remaining optical parameters at a high level. The only point of compromise comes from the voltage increase requirement upon reduction of the twist- angle in order to maintain cell contrast. Although this inflates the power consumption of the system, beneficial effects upon the total light scattering provoked by the device are also observed. The final sections deal with a new mode of operation for a twisted-nematic liquid crystal cell when placed between crossed polarisers together with an interference filter possessing a high optical transmittance over {{the central part of the}} visible spectrum. This mode of operation means that the cell is in a dark state when inactivated. Application of a small stimulating voltage transmutes the unit into the light state, where upon further increment of the driving electronics beyond this point reverts the system back into a low transmittance phase. Such a mode of operation for a twisted-nematic cell offers several advantages over that of the normally white mode when considering the optical lens of an automatically darkening welding filter. In particular, a dark, fail-safe state is provided should the controlling electronics malfunction preventing the unit from holding in a potentially hazardous light phase, a property usually associated with the normally black mode of operation, whilst the fast switching speed from the light to the dark state associated with the normally white mode of operation is maintained. It is shown that there are only two cell types that display this phenomenon and the optical properties of these two systems are analysed in some detail with the view of developing an automatically darkening welding filter based on this technology.

40|$|Optical {{reflectance}} from a plant leaf {{increases in}} response to stress and disease. Previous studies at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock found that, while the reflectance from a rice leaf increased with increased salinity, reflectance changes {{could not be used}} to differentiate one stress or disease from another. The objective {{of this study is to}} characterize the angular distribution of optical transmittance for a healthy rice leaf using a ray tracing technique and assuming a three-media optical model. The ultimate goal is to relate this distribution to specific plant pathologies. Three rays are traced through the cross section of a healthy rice leaf by applying laws of geometric optics and considering air, cell wall, and chloroplast as media. The <b>angular</b> distribution of <b>transmittance</b> is calculated for each ray trace. Lei is defined as the length of irradiated upper epidermal surface leading to a continuous transmittance Tbi(0) at the bottom surface. The total transmittance is defined as the sum over i of Tbi(theta). Delta thetai is defined as the angle over which Tbi(theta) extends and (thetaj - thetai) is defined as the angular difference between the bisector of Delta thetai and the bisector of Delta thetaj. The probability density functions pdf(Delta theta) and pdf(thetaj -thetai) are defined and shown to have diagnostic potential...|$|R
