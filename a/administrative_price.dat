50|$|During 1995-1998 {{monetary}} policy was highly expansionary. Net domestic credit of the National Bank of Belarus was increasing {{at the rate}} of over 100 percent from 1996 till mid-1998 as a consequence of numerous presidential decrees and resolution of the Council of Ministers instructing NBB to extend credits. Since no external sources were available for covering state budget deficit, the NBB emission activity provided its financing. Also, through authorized banks serving governmental programs, the NBB extended preferential targeted loans to state-owned enterprises. The list of credited enterprises is prepared by the government and sometimes depends on the ad-hoc strategies of development. In 2000, Belarus managed to unify its currency exchange rates, tightened its {{monetary policy}}, and partially liberalized the foreign currency market. Starting from the period of an administrative peg of the exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble in 1995, the monetary policy was based on administrative regulation of interest rates. In November 1995, administrative limitations of the inter-bank credit market activity were initiated and still remain in force. In spite of the Central Bank Law passed in 1994 guaranteeing its independence, President Lukashenko has a power to nominate and dismiss the Chairman of the NBB. and to formulate monetary and foreign exchange policy. Over the past years, preferential credits, <b>administrative</b> <b>price</b> setting, and decline of the interests rate spread below 15 percentage points {{in the second quarter of}} 1997 resulted in damaging consequences to enterprises and especially banks. As the process of exhaustion of the Central Bank's hard currency reserves exhibits a dangerous tendency, government introduced restrictions on currency transactions. These have resulted in inconvertibility of the Belarusian ruble for the current transactions since March 1998.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} monetary policy and <b>administrative</b> <b>price</b> adjustments on price variability in a low inflation economy characterized by relatively frequent <b>administrative</b> <b>price</b> adjustments. Fluctuations of market determined prices, prices of agricultural goods in particular, are linked to poor synchronization between <b>administrative</b> <b>price</b> changes and monetary policy. If monetary policy {{does not account for}} expected changes in administrative prices, demand for free goods shifts, causing fluctuation of prices for agricultural goods, because the supply of these goods is highly inelastic in Armenia. The findings contribute {{to a better understanding of}} agricultural price variability during 1998 - 2002. The impact of macroeconomic policy and structural adjustments on income distribution and rural poverty incidence are also examined. This research has immediate policy implications, since Armenia will continue to undergo major upward price adjustments of regulated prices, which may have a negative impact on income distribution unless aggregate demand management is changed.

Using a dual approach to trade and trade restrictiveness indices, we analyze {{the impact of these}} market distortions on welfare and trade volume. Then, we compute optimum distortions, which minimize the welfare cost of observed self-sufficiency and production objectives. We rationalize these optimum distortions to what could be claimed as legitimate protection under a “food security ” (FS) box in World Trade Organization negotiations. FS-box protection is sensitive to changes in the definition and the extent of the FS objectives. We show that FS via production targets and reliance on imports would be more palatable to consumers and trade partners, while preserving rents to the farm sector...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of market land prices that were collected from land purchased contracts in the Czech Republic. Regression model was used to identify determinants explaining variability of market prices between 2008 and 2009. It was found out that type of plantation, region, type of buyers, plot size, distance to regional city or number of parcels play significant role. These factors explain {{more than a half}} of variance in land price. Quality of land that was expressed through <b>administrative</b> <b>price</b> has significant effect on market price. Yet, such effect became less import in regions nearby cities (e. g. Prague and Olomouc), where the market land price is significantly influenced by the distance to the district city. Land reform, however has not been confirmed to stimulate higher prices for sellers. It is reasonable to expect that part of the remaining variation could still be accounted for by non-random variables.

50|$|In his 1980 book, Economics of Shortage, {{perhaps his}} most {{influential}} work, Kornai {{argued that the}} chronic shortages seen throughout Eastern Europe in the late 1970s (and which continued during the 1980s) were not the consequences of planners’ errors or the wrong prices, but rather systemic flaws. In his 1988 book, The Socialist System, The Political Economy of Communism {{he argued that the}} command economy based on the unchallenged control by a Marxist-Leninist communist party leads to a predominance of bureaucratic administration of state firms, through centralized planning and management, and the use of <b>administrative</b> <b>pricing</b> to eliminate the effects of the market, leading to individual responses to the incentives of this system, ultimately causing observable and inescapable economic phenomena known as the shortage economy. Kornai is very skeptical of efforts to create market socialism.|$|R

This paper investigates the impact of <b>administrative</b> monopoly power <b>price</b> on regional energy efficiency.

The finding is that the huge difference in <b>administrative</b> monopoly power <b>price</b> among regions {{is an important factor}} impacting energy efficiency, the higher the <b>administrative</b> monopoly power <b>price,</b> the higher the energy efficiency. The artificial inter-provincial barrier in power market and <b>administrative</b> monopoly power <b>price</b> hinders the circulation of power resources among different regions so that there is no efficient allocation of resources all over the country. Besides, it is hard to rectify low allocation efficiency by relying on market force.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{novelty of}} this paper lies in offering explanations of changing priorities and of the stop-go-stop sequence of policies in Poland in the years 1990 - 1991. The paper suggests that, {{in the first year}} of the reform, achieving price stability was secondary to the following three other aims: a substantial increase of the international reserves (large up-front devaluation required), a drastic reduction of the share of dollar currency in the total money supply (large monetary expansion is required) and a major improvement of the quality of the price system (drastic increases of some <b>administrative</b> <b>prices</b> needed). It is shown that the money supply was effectively the only nominal rate and the incomes policy became nominal anchors only in the second year of the reform.

The reform package consists of lowering <b>administrative</b> <b>prices</b> as well as modifying the structure of production quotas leading to lower sugar production and bringing down subsidized export to within WTO limits. However, these reforms do not address other components of the EU sugar policies such as non-preferential tariffs, quota reallocation across regions, or opening up the competitive structure of the EU sugar industry. This {{makes it difficult to}} assess the economic and trade implications of the reform package.
