40|$|Cellular phone {{technology}} has revolutionized communications throughout the {{developed and developing}} world and, for many developing countries, has offered a way for telecommunication companies to “leapfrog ” over wireline communications infrastructure directly to wireless communications services. Cellular infrastructure, however, is still too expensive for the billions {{of people living in}} areas with low population densities and per-capita incomes. Leveraging existing communications and transportation infrastructures, DakNet combines WiFi, VOIP, and Prepaid Cards to provide an economically viable solution to provide villagers with an email address and phone number today while creating a migration path to future wireless communications infrastructure. The Economics of the Digital Divide In the developing world the cost of digital connectivity using traditional communications technologies becomes increasingly prohibitive outside of urban areas. As one moves further away from existing backbone communications infrastructure, the costs of connectivity rise dramatically while population density and <b>income</b> <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> decrease dramatically. Available <b>income</b> <b>per</b> square kilometer therefore drops by orders of magnitude from an estimated $ 4, 500, 000 per square kilometer/year in urban areas (1, 500 people per square kilometer with an <b>average</b> annual <b>income</b> <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> of $ 3, 000) to just $ 77, 000 per square kilometer in rural areas (220 people per square kilometer with an <b>average</b> annual <b>income</b> <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> of $ 350). This is the underlying reason why telecommunications companies {{have not been able to}} economically service many rural areas, which are referred to as the ‘last mile’, i. e. the problem of delivering connectivity from a communications backbone to the premises of end-users. This is also one of the main causes of the urban-rural Digital Divide in developing countries...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of China’s trial fallow policy; the heavy metal {{pollution}} of farmland is addressed via field surveys in Hunan Province, where the fallow policy has been implemented, and in Jiangxi Province, where {{it has not been}} implemented. We measured and analyzed willingness to accept (WTA) using the contingent valuation method (CVM). The conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) Farmer awareness of heavy metal pollution and pollution sources is higher in Jiangxi Province than in Hunan Province; (2) Ignoring the impact of other factors, the WTA of farmers is 902 (yuan /mu) in Jiangxi Province and 902. 26 (yuan /mu) in Hunan Province. Considering the influence of the basic characteristics of the respondents using the parameter estimation method, the WTA of farmers is 839. 34 (yuan/mu) in Jiangxi Province and 934. 39 (yuan/mu) in Hunan Province. There is little difference in WTA between the two provinces, but both estimates are higher than the national compensation standards; (3) The factors that affect the WTA of farmers in Jiangxi Province are gender, education level, <b>average</b> annual <b>income</b> and <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> arable land.
