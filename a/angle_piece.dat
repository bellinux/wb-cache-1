50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is built}} from alloy angle, bolted and riveted together and skinned with light alloy. The plans allow for either flat or rounded sides, the latter requiring just one extra <b>angle</b> <b>piece</b> per side. The Kricket {{is powered by}} a 50-65 hp (37-48 kW) flat-four Volkswagen air-cooled engine, installed with its cylinder heads and exhausts exposed outside the engine cowling, which drives a two blade propeller. The single seat places the pilot behind the trailing edge of the upper wing, giving him reasonable upward vision. Behind him the ventral decking slopes down to the tail. There is a fixed, conventional undercarriage with main wheels fitted with mechanical brakes, enclosed in speed fairings and mounted on wire braced, faired, light-alloy legs. The tail wheel is mounted on a long, shallowly inclined leg which reaches back to the elevator trailing edge.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} {{the performance of}} the ridge vent Shinglevent II, a product of Air Vent Inc., in regard to the possible entry of snow into the attic space under strong wind conditions. The Shinglevent II configuration made available by Air Vent Inc. was tested for snow infiltration. To simulate field conditions as closely as possible, actual natural dry snow was used. The tests were conducted during winter using the open circuit mode of operation of the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory boundary layer wind tunnel. Tests 'have been carried out to date at a wind approach angle of 0 degrees (wind direction perpendicular to the roof ridge). The model was constructed in three pieces (a central <b>piece</b> and two <b>angle</b> <b>pieces)</b> so that, by omitting the two <b>angle</b> <b>pieces,</b> it can be fitted in the tunnel in a rotated 45 degree position for additional testing with 45 degree approach winds.

40|$|ABSTRACT:A ghani is {{a machine}} and pestle device which grinds oilseed into fine {{particles}} and extract oil from it. The oilseeds and subsequently the expressed oil {{are held in}} a scooped circular pit in the exact centre of a circular mortar made of stone or wood. In it works a stout, upright pestle which descends from a top curved or <b>angled</b> <b>piece,</b> in which the pestle rests in a scooped-out hollow that permits the pestle to rotate, eased by some soapy or oily lubricant. Today the single <b>angled</b> <b>piece</b> {{takes the form of}} two shorter pieces pinioned or chained together. The bottom of the lower <b>angled</b> <b>piece</b> is attached to a load-beam; one end of the load-beam rides around the outside of the barrel, while the other is yoked to the animal. The load-beam is weighted down with either heavy stones or even the seated operator. As the animal moves in a circular ambit, the pestle rotates, exerting lateral pressure on the upper chest of the pit, first pulverizing the oilseed and then crushing out its oil. But with the advent of oil expeller technology, almost all ghani were closed down. But still some ghani are running which are now made of iron and steel and it is driven by 2 HP motor. In India, oil extraction machine for extracting oil from seeds was designed and fabricated for market oriented production. The procedures employed include the design stage, construction and testing. The machine components are: Wooden hopper, wooden crusher, Connecting Rod, The reduction gear, the electric motor (2 hp, 3 -phase), the frame, the belt. oil are produced on a large scale which is used for various purposes such as Edible etc...|$|R
50|$|On the Mark VII, {{the hull}} front armour {{was made up}} of a lower <b>angled</b> <b>piece</b> of 5.5 in, a nearly {{horizontal}} 2.25 in plate and a vertical 6 inch plate. The hull sides, were, for the most part, 3.75 in. The rear was 2 in and the hull top 0.525 in. The turret of the Mark VII was 6 in to the front and 3.75 in for the other sides. The turret roof was 0.79 (20 mm) thick. Plate was specified as IT 80, the cast sections as IT 90.|$|R
50|$|This was {{designed}} by Emiel Fox (1869 or 1870-1941). Patents relating to early versions of the lock go back to at least 1907. Fox set up the Fox Police Lock Company in New York City to manufacture the locks under the brand name Police Lock; other companies have made similar locks under the same designation, so the term has become genericized to a degree. The name comes from the police procedure for securing a damaged door, which uses a similarly <b>angled</b> <b>piece</b> of sturdy wood nailed in place.|$|R

50|$|If a {{sheet of}} glass {{is placed in the}} tank, the depth of water in the tank will be {{shallower}} over the glass than elsewhere. The speed of a wave in water depends on the depth, so the ripples slow down as they pass over the glass. This causes the wavelength to decrease. If the junction between the deep and shallow water is at an angle to the wavefront, the waves will refract. In the diagram above, the waves can be seen to bend towards the normal. The normal is shown as a dotted line. The dashed line is the direction that the waves would travel if they had not met the <b>angled</b> <b>piece</b> of glass.|$|R
50|$|The oddly <b>angled</b> <b>piece</b> of land, {{the site}} of former Circus Krembser, was located in the {{historic}} Friedrich-Wilhelm-Stadt quarter, {{at the corner of}} Friedrich-Karl-Ufer 1 (since 1951: Kapelle-Ufer) on the Spree riverside and Unterbaumstraße. Wedged between the Stadtbahn railway viaduct and the firewall of the building nextdoor, it made for a difficult design of a prestigious building. The architects designed a cupola above the podium that covered up the firewall, and the front facade with its portico turned the street corner into a kind of vestibule. The remaining triangular outside areas were set off from the street with lattice work and gates and functioned as gardens; the remaining area in the back served as delivery courtyard.|$|R

50|$|To allow {{a soldier}} to {{see out of}} the trench without exposing his head, a {{loophole}} could be built into the parapet. A loophole might simply be {{a gap in the}} sandbags, or it might be fitted with a steel plate. German snipers used armour-piercing bullets that allowed them to penetrate loopholes. Another means to see over the parapet was the trench periscope—in its simplest form, just a stick with two <b>angled</b> <b>pieces</b> of mirror at the top and bottom. A number of armies made use of the periscope rifle, which enabled soldiers to snipe at the enemy without exposing themselves over the parapet, although at the cost of reduced shooting accuracy. The device is most associated with Australian and New Zealand troops at Gallipoli, where the Turks held the high ground.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} {{the performance of}} roof ridge vents {{in regard to the}} possible entry of snow into the attic space under strong wind conditions. A total of 11 vent configurations made available by Air Vent Inc. were tested for snow infiltration. Additionally, attic pressures and flow rates were measured for 13 ridge vent arrangements, including the 11 tested for snow infiltration. For reasons of expense, time, and ease of execution, wind tunnel models of snow blowing and drifting have been used for many years in design and in specific problem solutions. A fairly large number of modelling materials have been employed, e. g. sawdust, mica, gypsum, peat, sand, borax, magnesium carbonate, glass beads, activated clay, expanded polysterene, wheat bran, and semolina. (A recent study of snow loads on the Hubert Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis was carried out for example using glass beads with a diameter of 0. 1 mm, at a scale of 1 : 384.) In the present study, however, to simulate field conditions as closely as possible, actual natural dry snow was used. The tests were conducted during winter months using the open circuit mode of operation of the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory. The results of the study offer a comparison of the effectiveness of various ridge vent designs, valid of course under the conditions under which the tests were carried out, as described in detail in this report. The tests have been carried out to date at a wind approach angle of 0 degrees (wind direction perpendicular to the roof ridge). The model has been constructed in three pieces (a central <b>piece</b> and two <b>angle</b> <b>pieces)</b> so that, by omitting the two <b>angle</b> <b>pieces,</b> it can be fitted in the tunnel in a rotated 45 degree position for additional testing with 45 degree approach winds. This testing, originally planned for the winter of 1995, had to be postponed until next winter due to the surprisingly mild 1995 winter weather conditions in Minneapolis. Air Vent, Inc...|$|R
40|$|In 1847, Domenico Ragona-Scinà (1820 - 1892) {{published}} {{a method of}} optically superimposing images using an <b>angled</b> <b>piece</b> of colored glass. He showed that {{if one looks at}} a black, filled circle through the colored glass and superimposes on it the reflection from the glass of something white, the filled circle looks tinted with the complementary color of the background: simultaneous color contrast or contrast color. Although Ragona-Scinà 2 ̆ 7 s method and his observation have been cited into the 21 st century, the former for its simplicity and the latter for its challenges to early theories of color vision, some errors have crept in and the phenomenon still lacks an agreed-on explanation.

5000|$|Gum {{naval stores}} {{cultivation}} {{refers to the}} labor-intensive method of extracting pine resin from the trees (the raw gum). The method of collection—tapping the trees—vaguely resembles that used on a rubber plantation or in a maple sugar grove. However, instead of preparing the tree to receive a pipe or tap, the tree is gashed with an inch-wide curved blade, called a “hack,” to remove all of the bark down through the cambium layer. An <b>angled</b> <b>piece</b> of galvanized tin is then placed below the eight-inch-long, one-inch-wide gash (also known as “the streak”) to direct the oozing sap into a quart-sized rectangular cup fixed to the tree. Each new “streak” is put onto the tree above the preceding one, and gradually a vertical “cat face” more than thirty inches in height is formed. Through the mid-twentieth century, a [...] "puller," [...] a type of hack that had a long handle, was used to extend the streak up the tree to a height of more than seven feet.|$|R

40|$|Our coast fortifications are for {{the purpose}} of {{protecting}} coast cities, naval bases and other utilities from bombardment, of preventing the occupation of harbors by an enemy and of providing safe harbor for our fleet. For these purposes large caliber guns and mortars of great power have been mounted on concrete emplacements and supplied with necessary accessories in the way of searchlights, submarine mines, observing and range finding stations. Of the two systems of guns in use in coast artillery, the high power guns with a flat trajectory (those shooting in a straight line) are designed to pierce the side armor of battleships; the high <b>angle</b> <b>pieces,</b> howitzers or mortars, {{are for the}} purpose of throwing a projectile on the decks. The former has the greatest accuracy and the latter attacks a ship at its weakest point. A gun of at least 12 -inch caliber is required to pierce the armor of a battleship. Twelve-inch guns were placed in many of our coast defenses several years ago. They are mounted on disappearing carriages, and, when fired, the gun rises above the battlement for a moment, sends forth its shell, then sinks down again concealed behind the fortification. The 12 -inch gun weighs 52 tons and fires a shell weighing 1, 070 pou nds, which travels 2, 250 feet per second and can pierce the vitals of a battleship 6 miles away, or perforate the casement armor of one 11 miles away.
