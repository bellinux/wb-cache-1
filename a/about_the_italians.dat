60|$|To {{guard against}} calms--when our salmon boat would be useless--we also had in {{readiness}} a light rowing skiff equipped with spoon- oars. But at such times, {{when the wind}} failed us, {{we were forced to}} row out from the wharf as soon as they rowed from the ship. In the night-time, on the other hand, we were compelled to patrol the immediate vicinity of the ship; which we did, Charley and I standing four-hour watches turn and turn <b>about.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Italians,</b> however, preferred the daytime in which to escape, and so our long night vigils were without result.|$|E

50|$|From June 1940, three Italian {{submarines}} patrolled off the Canary Islands and Madeira, {{followed by}} three more off the Azores. When these patrols were completed, the six boats {{returned to their}} new base at Bordeaux. Their initial patrol area was the Northwestern Approaches and at the start they out-numbered their German allies' submarines.

50|$|The tournament was {{provoked}} by a French knight Charles de la Motte who, after {{drinking too much}} of the local wine, made disparaging remarks <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians.</b> It consisted in a mounted tourney between 13 Italians (the most famous being Ettore Fieramosca), who were part of the Spanish army based in Barletta, and 13 French knights who were based in Canosa di Puglia. The Italian knights won the battle, and the French had to pay ransom. Barletta has since acquired the appellation Città della Disfida (City of the Challenge) as a result.|$|E

50|$|A {{depressed}} Hill asks Poet and the Homeboys {{for some}} drugs. Hill accidentally snorts a lethal amount of heroin {{and goes into}} septic shock. Angry, Redding searches for the men responsible for drugging Hill and Poet is his first accusation. Poet lies, telling Burr {{to look at his}} enemies the Italians and Latinos instead of his friends among the Homeboys. Poet then uses Hill's overdose as an excuse to kill an Italian inmate as a means of drawing suspicion away from himself. With the help of Latino inmate Carmen Guerra, Poet gets Agamemnon Busmalis, a witness with no vested interest to lie <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> overdosing Hill. An Italian inmate named Salvatore DeSanto is falsely accused, and dies from an overdose of LSD Redding had put in his food. Hill then tells McManus that DeSanto did not give him the drugs and Poet, afraid for his life gets Busmalis to say the Latinos supplied Hill. The Latinos and Homeboys are no longer allied after the accusation is brought up and as a result, Morales now hates the black inmates.|$|E

There are few local industries in which the Italians, the Germans, the Turks or the Jews become involved, all of them proving to be good craftsmen, entrepreneurs or traders. For some of the foreigners who came and remained in Râmnicu Vâlcea, and which we have been able to identify, until now, the archive information notifies the locality from where they came, the place of birth, along with their previous occupation. Due to the fact that the numbering of the buildings has suffered, in time, repeated modifications, we have managed to present their firms, from the main commercial routes, according to the number of the place where the firm was, as found in the archive documents...|$|E
