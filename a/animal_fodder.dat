By the end of the battle the Allied air forces had flown 19,000 tons of supplies and 12,000 men into Kohima and Imphal, and flown out 13,000 casualties and 43,000 non-combatants. Among the supplies carried during the siege were over a million gallons of fuel, over a thousand bags of mail and 40million cigarettes. Several thousand mules were used to supply outlying outposts, for example 17th Indian Division up the Bishenpur trail, so <b>animal</b> <b>fodder</b> was also flown in during the siege.

5000|$|In western Switzerland and the Jura {{mountains}} most {{houses were}} built of stone due to limited timber supplies. However, in northern Switzerland and the Bernese Mittelland plentiful wood meant that most construction was either all wood or wooden with a stone foundation. In both regions, by the 15th century, the local style had {{evolved into a}} multi-story, multi-purpose byre-dwelling with <b>animals,</b> <b>fodder,</b> storage and living quarters under one roof. Houses in the high Jura mountains were built with small windows {{to protect them from}} winter wind and snow, while those in the more temperate Swiss Plateau usually had lighter walls and larger windows. [...] Shallowly sloping shingle roofs were replaced with ones with a steeper, tiled roof beginning in the 16th century. Other farmhouses remained thatched until the introduction of fire insurance in the 19th century after which they gradually disappeared.

(Given the logistical difficulties, Robertson scoffed at suggestions that the Turks might invade Egypt, and by July, on his orders, Murray had shipped out 240,000 of the 300,000 British Empire troops in Egypt, including 9 infantry divisions, 3 independent infantry brigades and 9 heavy artillery batteries, most of them going to France, leaving him with 4 Territorial divisions and some mounted troops.)

2500|$|The {{climate in}} the far north of Europe made {{cultivation}} of cereals even more difficult, and the wheat so popular in the south was a luxury in northern Europe. [...] Wheat could cost {{at least twice as}} much as the most common grains, barley and rye. Barley was the most widely grown, but a great percentage of the harvest went into the extensive beer production, while rye was the principal bread grain. Like in the rest of Europe, oats was considered only fit as <b>animal</b> <b>fodder</b> and was only eaten when no other choice was available, and then usually as porridge or gruel. Though grains were in the highest regard among medieval Scandinavians and were among the most frequently mentioned foods, other vegetable foods were an indispensable part of the diet: peas, turnips, beans, carrots, onions, leeks and various greens and herbs all provided essential nutrients and vitamins. Kale, a form of cabbage, was especially important in Denmark and Sweden and was a valuable source of fresh food in the winter months, since it kept well and could be harvested (and even tasted better) after the first frost had set in.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to study the faecal coliforms removal capacity of Downflow Hanging Sponge (DHS) reactors as a post-treatment for an Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor. Three long-term continuous lab-scale DHS reactors i. e. a reactor with cube type sponges without recirculation, a similar one with recirculation and a reactor with curtain type sponges. The porosities of the applied medium were 91 %, 87 % and 47 % respectively. The organic loading rates were 0. 86 kgCOD m- 3 d- 1, 0. 53 kgCOD m- 3 d- 1 and 0. 24 kgCOD m- 3 d- 1 correspondingly at hydraulic loading rates of 1. 92 m 3 m- 2 d- 1, 2. 97 m 3 m- 2 d- 1 and 1. 32 m 3 m- 2 d- 1, respectively. The corresponding averages for faecal coliform removal were 99. 997 %, 99. 919 % and 92. 121 % respectively. The WHO (1989) standards, in terms of faecal coliform content for unrestricted irrigation (Category A), was achieved with the effluent of the cube type DHS (G 1) without recirculation.

40|$|Osteometric and paleopathological {{studies of}} Neolithic {{material}} from Western Ligurian caves {{have shown a}} high degree of robusticity of the forelimb in these populations. In this study we intend to test previous results by means of a biomechanical approach. The cross-sectional geometry (CSG) properties of the humerus of a sample composed of 17 Neolithic individuals (NEOL), nine males and eight females, from three caves (Arene Candide, Arma dell’Aquila, and Pollera) located in the Finalese region (Savona, Italy), have been analysed. The comparison with a European Late Upper Paleolithic (LUP) sample showed unchanged humeral robusticity in females, and increased humeral robusticity in males. Both sexes show a more rounded humeral diaphyseal circumference and decrease of lateralization. It has been supposed, on the base of faunal and archaeological evidence, that NEOL were prevalently pastoralist, and not committed agriculturalists. In the uneven, wooded and poor of pastures territory of Finalese region, NEOL people likely turned to pollarding – recurrently chopping of branches - in order to provide <b>animal’s</b> <b>fodder.</b> Such a laborious activity may have been a cause for the great robusticity of male humerus. The difference in humeral robusticity between males and females leads to an increase in sexual dimorphism, which may indicate different activity levels between genders, probably as a consequence of sexual division of labour. The decrease of lateralisation in both sexes may be related to an increase in activities that stressed both limbs in a similar way. In particular, the finding of grind stone in the archaeological record seems to explain the absence of lateralization in females, which might be related to the processing of cereals in the traditional fashion, by means of a grind stone held with both hands. CSG results seem to confirm previous results and furnish further evidence for the hypothesis of a prevalently pastoral economy of the Neolithic people of Western Liguria...|$|R
