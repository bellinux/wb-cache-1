5|$|The oppressive {{taxes and}} brutal {{collection}} methods incite sporadic rebellions that are suppressed harshly. Süß {{goes so far}} as to destroy half of a blacksmith's house to prove his power to punish those who refuse to pay their taxes. When the blacksmith attacks Süß's coach with <b>a</b> <b>sledgehammer,</b> Süß has the blacksmith hanged on the grounds that an attack on the Duke's minister is tantamount to an attack on the Duke himself.|$|E
5|$|Three weeks later, on Raw, Vince McMahon signed another {{handicap}} match pitting the Spirit Squad against Shawn Michaels. The match never started, however, {{because the}} Spirit Squad attacked Michaels, ripping apart his ring attire and, in storyline, shattering his knee with a steel chair. McMahon then called Triple H {{to the ring}} to attack Michaels with <b>a</b> <b>sledgehammer,</b> however, Kenny snatched the sledgehammer away, disrespecting Triple H, which led to him attacking the group.|$|E

After SummerSlam, then WWE Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar became exclusive to SmackDown!, leaving Raw without a world champion. Raw general manager Eric Bischoff then awarded Triple H the World Heavyweight Championship, represented by the Big Gold Belt (which previously {{had been used to}} represent the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and WCW World Heavyweight Championship), making him the first World Heavyweight Champion. Triple H retained his title against Rob Van Dam at Unforgiven when Ric Flair hit Van Dam with <b>a</b> <b>sledgehammer.</b>|$|E

The match began in the entrance area and involved Umaga getting speared through the stage setting. The match moved to into the audience {{before returning to the}} ring. Several weapons were used, and Umaga splashed Triple H through an announce table.

5|$|In June 1998 {{the brother}} of the Sultan of Brunei, Prince Jefri Bolkiah, was sued by his former {{business}} partners in a case that was settled out of court. During the case the Manoukians claimed that Prince Jefri kept 40 prostitutes at a time at the Dorchester. In 1999, the hotel hosted the first ever Pride of Britain Awards. In March 2002, a robbery took place {{in the lobby of the}} hotel when thieves wearing ski masks smashed the jewellery cabinets with <b>a</b> <b>sledgehammer</b> and took off with jewels. The Dorchester celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2011. To mark the event, the charity 'Trees for Cities' planted eighty 'future great trees' around the capital.|$|E

50|$|A maul is a long-handled hammer with a {{heavy metal}} head, either of lead or iron. Similar in {{appearance}} and function to <b>a</b> modern <b>sledgehammer,</b> it is sometimes shown as having a spear-like spike on the fore-end of the haft.|$|R

5|$|In {{the main}} event, Triple H faced Kevin Nash inside Hell in a Cell for the World Heavyweight Championship, with Mick Foley as the guest referee. During {{the start of}} the match, both men used a steel chair, a hammer, and the cell to their advantage. Eventually, Nash hit Triple H with a barbed wire bat many times before Triple H hit him with the steel steps. As Triple H brought <b>a</b> <b>sledgehammer</b> into the ring, Foley {{attempted}} to take it away from him, resulting in Triple H hitting Foley and Nash with a steel chair. Triple H followed up, Pedigreeing Nash. During this time, Foley had recuperated and was able to officiate the pinfall made by Triple H on Nash, thus Triple H retained the World Heavyweight Title.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} album Blood Fire Death, {{one of the}} first {{definitive}} Viking metal releases, Bathory incorporated a diverse range of musical elements. While retaining the noise and chaos of previous recordings, the band took a more sorrowful and melodic approach, working in ballads based on Germanic and Norse folklore, shanty-like melodies and folk music elements such as bourdon sounds, Jew's harps, and fifes. Bathory added natural found sounds, such as ocean waves, thunder, and wild animal noises, in a style similar to that of musique concrète. Instruments were sometimes used to create onomatopoeic effects such as drum sounds imitating thunder or <b>a</b> <b>sledgehammer.</b> The songs typically featured multi-sectional formal structures, following a pattern of three instrumental sections– introduction, bridge, and finale– and two vocal sections– stanza and refrain.|$|E
5|$|The Tiger {{went into}} {{production}} in June 1964, {{little more than}} a year after the completion of the Shelby prototype. Painted and trimmed bodies were supplied by Pressed Steel in Oxfordshire, and the engines and gearboxes directly from Ford in America. Installing the engine required some unusual manufacturing methods, including using <b>a</b> <b>sledgehammer</b> to bash in part of the already primed and painted bulkhead to allow the engine to be slid into place. Jensen was soon able to assemble up to 300 Tigers a month, which were initially offered for sale only in North America. The first few Tigers assembled had to be fitted with a Borg-Warner 4-speed all-synchromesh manual gearbox, until Ford resolved its supply problems and was able to provide an equivalent unit as used in the Ford Mustang.|$|E

5|$|The fourth {{match was}} between Triple H and Randy Orton for the World Heavyweight Championship. Before the match, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff banned Evolution (Batista and Ric Flair) from ringside. Orton had the {{advantage}} until Triple H countered an RKO by throwing Orton out of the ring. Triple H kept the advantage and targeted Orton's left knee until Orton knocked him into a broadcast table. Orton kept the advantage until he missed a DDT. Triple H knocked both Orton and the referee down with a clothesline and tried to hit Orton with <b>a</b> <b>sledgehammer</b> but Orton pulled him into the ringpost. Triple H performed another clothesline and a Pedigree to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Triple H and Ric Flair began at WWE Homecoming, when Triple H {{returned}} to WWE television after {{an absence of}} three months. The two had been aligned since 2002, as members of Evolution, and were partners in a tag team match on the show. After they won the match, Triple H attacked Flair with <b>a</b> <b>sledgehammer.</b> The week after, Triple H explained his actions, saying that he realized Flair {{was no longer the}} legend he was, and he needed to stop Flair. Flair and Triple H met in a steel cage match at Taboo Tuesday, which Flair won. A Last Man Standing match was made between the two for Survivor Series.|$|E
5|$|With Orton {{trapped in}} Bryan's {{submission}} hold, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon emerged from backstage {{and pulled the}} original referee {{out of the ring}} to prevent the match from ending. Triple H then sent in referee Scott Armstrong on his behalf, as Batista performed the Batista Bomb on a distracted Bryan. Armstrong made the count, but Bryan kicked out at two. A charging Batista was sent into the ring post when Bryan dodged. With no disqualifications in a triple threat match, Bryan kicked referee Armstrong in the head, following with a suicide dive out of the ring onto Triple H, Stephanie McMahon and Armstrong. Triple H tried to retaliate with <b>a</b> <b>sledgehammer,</b> but Bryan snatched it and used the sledgehammer on Triple H, knocking him off the ring apron. This ended Triple H and Stephanie McMahon's interference in the match.|$|E
50|$|According {{to arrest}} warrant {{affidavits}} {{filed in the}} case, autopsies concluded that all four victims had been beaten {{to death with a}} blunt object, and investigators believe the murder weapon was <b>a</b> 3-pound <b>sledgehammer,</b> which was found in the grave where Summer McStay and one of her sons were buried. Investigators testified that they believe the victims were tortured before they were killed.|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} was eagerly pressed for {{by both the}} United States military and the Soviet Union but rejected by the British. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, <b>Sledgehammer</b> was never carried out; in addition, planners decided it was impractical. This perception was reinforced {{by the failure of}} the smaller Dieppe Raid, in August 1942. Instead the British proposal for an invasion of French North Africa took place in November 1942 under the code name Operation Torch.|$|R
2500|$|One of the Dials illustrators, {{responsible}} {{for many of}} the Dials covers, was Edward Hopper. Hopper won a nationwide competition during the war for a patriotic poster design entitled [...] "Smash The Hun". The design, which featured a Morse company worker swinging <b>a</b> large <b>sledgehammer</b> toward <b>a</b> nest of threatening bayonets, was later reproduced (without the accompanying caption) {{on the cover of the}} Dials February 1919 edition. Hopper would later achieve fame as a leading artist of the American realist school.|$|R
5|$|Bosniak {{scholars}} {{object to}} the ostensibly negative portrayal of Muslim characters in Andrić's works. During the 1950s, his most vocal Bosniak detractors accused him of everything from plagiarism to being a Serb nationalist, and made remarks insinuating that he was homosexual. Some {{went so far as}} to call for his Nobel Prize to be taken away. Most Bosniak criticism of his works appeared in the period immediately before the breakup of Yugoslavia and in the aftermath of the Bosnian War. In early 1992, a Bosniak nationalist in Višegrad destroyed a statue of Andrić with <b>a</b> <b>sledgehammer.</b> Twenty years later, in 2012, filmmaker Emir Kusturica and Bosnian Serb President Milorad Dodik unveiled another statue of Andrić in Višegrad, this time as part of the construction of an ethno-town called Andrićgrad, sponsored by Kusturica and the Government of Republika Srpska. Andrićgrad was officially inaugurated in June 2014, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand.|$|E
5|$|Of all the U.S. Presidents he {{associated}} with during his career, he was closest to John F. Kennedy. Sinatra often invited Kennedy to Hollywood and Las Vegas, {{and the two}} would womanize and enjoy parties together. In January 1961 Sinatra and Peter Lawford organized the Inaugural Gala in Washington, D.C., held on the evening before President Kennedy was sworn into office. In 1962, Sinatra was snubbed by Kennedy {{during his visit to}} Palm Springs when he decided to stay with the Republican Bing Crosby, due to FBI concerns about Sinatra's alleged connections to organized crime. Sinatra had invested a lot of his own money in upgrading the facilities at his home in anticipation of the President's visit, fitting it with a heliport, which he later reportedly smashed up with <b>a</b> <b>sledgehammer</b> upon being rejected. Despite the snub, when he learned of Kennedy's assassination he reportedly sobbed in his bedroom for three days.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{featured}} preliminary matches was between Ric Flair versus Triple H for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. On the October 3 episode of Raw, WWE Homecoming, Triple H returned after a four-month hiatus. He {{took part in}} a match, teaming up with Flair, who was a fan favorite during Triple H's absence, to take on Chris Masters and Carlito. The duo defeated Masters and Carlito; after the match, Triple H turned on Flair and hit him with <b>a</b> <b>sledgehammer.</b> The following week, Triple H explained his actions, saying he saw that Flair had become mediocre when he was spat at and when he won the Intercontinental title. Triple H continued to say that he needed to end Flair's career so his memories of Flair would not be tarnished. On the October 24 episode of Raw, a singles match was scheduled between Flair and Triple H at Taboo Tuesday, in which the fans would {{be given the opportunity to}} choose the type of match they compete in. The choice of the matches were a regular match, submission match, or a Steel Cage, a match where the ring is surrounded by walls of steel, for the Intercontinental title.|$|E
50|$|A {{drilling}} hammer, club hammer, lump hammer, crack hammer, mini-sledge or thor hammer is <b>a</b> small <b>sledgehammer</b> whose relatively {{light weight}} and short handle allow single-handed use. It {{is useful for}} light demolition work, driving masonry nails, and for use with a steel chisel when cutting stone or metal. In this last application, its weight drives the chisel more deeply into the material being cut than lighter hammers. Club hammers are common on the British inland waterways for driving mooring pins into the towpath or canal bank.|$|R
50|$|Joni fends off {{the ghost}} {{long enough for}} Chuck to recover, and help her defeat it with its own <b>sledgehammer.</b> <b>As</b> the sun rises, Joni and Chuck flee from the house, unbeknownst that the killer's young form is glaring at them from the house's top window.|$|R
50|$|Saulė is {{mentioned}} {{in one of}} the earliest written sources on Lithuanian mythology. According to Slavic translation of the Chronicle by John Malalas (1261), a powerful smith Teliavelis made the Sun and threw it into the sky. Missionary Jeronim Jan Silvanus Prazsky (ca. 1369-1440) spent three years attempting to Christianize Lithuania and later recounted a myth about kidnapped Saulė. She was held in a tower by powerful king and rescued by the zodiac using <b>a</b> giant <b>sledgehammer.</b> Jeronim Prazsky swore that he personally witnessed the hammer, venerated by the locals.|$|R
