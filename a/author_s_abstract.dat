40|$|The {{present study}} deals with {{conditions}} {{relevant to the}} diagnosis and evaluation of violations of the standards of argumentational integrity in everyday communication. We first present a general model of moral judgements in analogy to the German criminal law. The model comprises the following hierarchical levels of evaluation: 'facts' (criminal act coupled with corresponding intent), 'illicitness' (unlawful but not culpable act, {{as in the case}} of self-defence or lack of responsibility), and finally 'guilt'. We further distinguish between two types of 'facts' which we regard as the basic components of moral judgements: 'objective facts' (rule violations which are accessible to external observation) and 'subjective facts' (which relate to the speaker's state of mind, such as 'malicious intent' or 'negligence'). The main hypothesis in applying this model to rule violations in argumentation (offence) is that diagnosis of lack of argumentational integrity depends on the grading of 'objective' and 'subjective facts': diagnosis of offences against argumentational integrity is the more likely, the higher the relevance of the 'objective facts' and the degree of the 'subjective facts' (which, taken together, constitute the seriousness of the offence). We further assume that in general the presence of the 'facts' is as such already sufficient for a sentence of guilt, i. e. that the 'facts' are 'by default' upgraded onto the evaluation level of 'guilt'; retrospective consideration of mitigating circumstances can, however, lead to a revision of this first evaluation. The main hypothesis could be confirmed within a quasi-experimental design. In addition, an explorative content analysis of free responses relating to the modification of the initial sentence of guilt yielded results confirming the validity of the general model; heuristics relating to additional factors also emerged which in the future will have to be taken into account in modeling as well as empirically testing the diagnosis and evaluation of offences against argumentational integrity.

Es wird zunaechst ein generelles Rahmenmodell moralischer Urteile entwickelt, das als aufeinander aufbauende Wertungsstufen 'Tatbestandsmaessigkeit', 'Unrecht' und 'Schuld' umfasst; dabei konzipieren wir ein Unintegritaetsurteil als Schuldurteil i. S. eines persoenlichen Vorwurfs. Auf der Ebene der Tatbestandsmaessigkeit lassen sich dabei subjektive (z. B. 'absichtlich') und objektive Tatbestandsmerkmale (beobachtbare Regelverstoesse) unterscheiden, die in unserer Untersuchungskonzeption als Basiskomponenten der Unintegritaetsdiagnose angesetzt werden. Die grundlegende Hypothese lautet dann, dass argumentative Unintegritaet umso eher diagnostiziert wird, je hoeherwertig die objektiven Tatbestandsmerkmale und das Ausmass der subjektiven Tatbestandsmaessigkeit sind. Dabei nehmen wir an, dass die Tatbestandsmaessigkeit als solche im Regelfall bereits hinreichend fuer ein Schuldurteil ist, dass also die Tatbestandsmaessigkeit (per Voreinstellung) quasi auf die Wertungsstufe 'Schuld' hochtransformiert wird; eine nachtraegliche Beruecksichtigung von rechtfertigenden und/oder entschuldigenden Faktoren kann aber u. U. zu einer Ruecknahme dieses Urteils fuehren. Die grundlegende Hypothese konnte in einer quasi-experimentellen Untersuchung bestaetigt werden. Darueber hinaus erbrachte eine explorative inhaltsanalytische Auswertung zusaetzlich erhobener freier Antworten zur Urteilsmodifikation Belege fuer die Fruchtbarkeit des theoretischen Rahmenmodells; dabei ergaben sich auch heuristische Hinweise auf ergaenzende Faktoren, die kuenftig neben den Basiskomponenten bei der theoretischen Modellierung und empirischen Ueberpruefung der Diagnose und Bewertung argumentativer Unintegritaet zu beruecksichtigen sind.

40|$|This book {{addresses}} a key question: Why has Thailand faced similar threats {{over the years}} even though {{the country has been}} on a democratic path since the mid- 1970 s? Coups, a never-ending hazard in Thailand, represent not only the military’s intention to take over the government but also an illegitimate instrument for elite groups to restore the previous order, which had been in place for decades before the new political elite group emerged in the early 2000 <b>s.</b> (<b>author's</b> <b>abstract...</b>|$|R
40|$|We examine to {{what extent}} Europe´s stock markets are integrated, and how this can be measured. We review 54 {{empirical}} studies and find an overemphasis on price-based measures and {{a need for more}} quantity-based studies. We update the Baele et al (2004) study on investment funds' equity holdings to March 2006 for ten euro area and four non-euro area countries, provide additional quantity based evidence, and discuss integration theories. Our results indicate a decline in home bias particularly after the advent of the euro. We conclude that although European stock markets have undergone significant developments, the level of European integration is below expectations and there is a high joint integration with the U. <b>S.</b> (<b>author's</b> <b>abstract)</b> Series: EI Working Papers / Europainstitu...|$|R
40|$|When policy discussions turn {{to income}} {{provisions}} for the old-aged, {{the focus is}} often on Social Security programs and the long-term solvency of national public pension systems. While Social Security remains the most important income source for the non-working elderly in the United States, Americans have a much longer tradition of relying on occupational and individual pensions as {{a crucial part of}} their retirement income. The paper gives an account of relevant social and legal provisions with implications for voluntary and involuntary retirement, and documents how statutory changes during the past three decades have affected the financial well-being of current and future retirees. It concludes that growing risks in old age are less due to declining Social Security benefits than to several trends in the private industry and financial markets that have seriously weakened employmentbased, old-age protection. In terms of institutional changes, however, the United States has not seen any fundamental restructuring of its public pension system since the 1980 <b>s.</b> (<b>author's</b> <b>abstract...</b>|$|R
40|$|Citizen {{participation}} {{in terms of}} participatory technology assessment (PTA) has {{caused a lot of}} debate in science and technology policy. However, there are still many open questions: What is the actual impact of PTA on policy-making? On which normative theory of democracy is the evaluation of PTA based and does it make a difference which theory is used? Which framework is appropriate to evaluate the often fuzzy impact of PTA on policy-making? Is PTA actually a central element for policy-making or are other factors much more relevant such as politicians’ involvement or the presence of industry interests? What is the ‘nature’ of the public in different national and institutional contexts? How are expectations of policy-makers played out in the perceived need for regulation? These issues are addressed in a series of comparative papers in this issue which focus on the regulation of xenotransplantation in the 1990 s and early 2000 <b>s.</b> (<b>author's</b> <b>abstract...</b>|$|R
40|$|Vaccinations {{protect from}} infections, reduce infant mortality, and {{increase}} the standard of living. They enable a modern risk management. However, vaccinations require a risk management also {{in a very different}} sense: the danger of side effects and fatal incidents questions the benefits of vaccination up to the present day. Therefore, vaccination programs pose fundamental questions. What weighs more: a risk for the common good - or a risk to the individual? The article pursues the history of this risk management in Germany, and analyzes the interaction of risk ideas and concepts of social order. I focus on communication strategies for vaccination that came into use in the twentieth century that could not any longer rely on coercive measures. They also needed to appeal to the public and resort to "risk" as a public argument. The article therefore examines risk discourses with which the population should be convinced of the necessity of precautionary measures. The main thrust of the article will be that this kind of risk management was a prerequisite for a "social engineering", with which the idea of the "preventive self" was raised to the leading figure of modernity since the 1940 <b>s.</b> (<b>author's</b> <b>abstract...</b>|$|R
40|$|Departing {{from the}} renewed {{interest}} within economic history and neo-Schumpeterian perspectives on growth and economic transformation, we will suggest {{a theoretical framework}} for analyzing long term regional economic growth and transformation. Emphasis {{will be given to}} different driving forces and their various roles over time, lead-lag relations between industries and how divergence and convergence between regions shift cyclically as consequences of technological change, market integration and economic growth. We claim that systemic approaches in general have been neglected in regional science in favor of "neoregionalism" {{in the sense that the}} study of regional growth has been focusing for years on regional innovation systems and cluster theories without any regard to systemic relations at all. Using detailed time series data and applying a systemic approach we will follow Swedish regions from the structural crises in the mid 1970 s to the starting point of the present financial crises. Our results suggest that there are time lags as well as systemic spatial asymmetries between industries and regions leading to changing patterns of divergence and convergence in the regional system. Furthermore, there are indications that the regional disparities between centre and periphery have increased compared to the situation in the mid 1970 <b>s.</b> (<b>author's</b> <b>abstract)</b> Series: SRE - Discussion Paper...|$|R

At the same time, these positive personality traits were expected to stop the negative family processes {{that are likely to}} hinder a competent development in G 3. The findings were consistent with the selection aspect in the interactionist model. The model also said beforehand that economic stress and other family-related stress processes influenced the development of G 3 over the earlier G 2 personality. The socialization aspect in the interactionist model thus also received support. However,The findings were consistent with this social selection. The model also predicted that of the G 1 personality.
