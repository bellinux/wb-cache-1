40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, 2002. This is a {{study on}} NMB and seeks to {{establish}} what the bank could do, through the implementation of CRM, to attract new customers and retain existing ones {{in the face of}} intensifying competition. The number of banks in Zimbabwe has increased tremendously {{over the last five years}} from less than seven to over fifteen. Ironically, this has taken place against a background of an ailing economy, which is shrinking and a reducing number of viable companies that can be targeted for banking business. A review of the history of banking in Zimbabwe was undertaken to show how NMB decided on CRM as a means of making a difference with customers and thus have a competitive edge over its rivals. In particular, the attitude of banks to customers and customer expectations was looked at together with the changes that have taken place over the years. Literature on CRM was reviewed and more attention was paid to the main causes of failures in the implementation ofCRM and how this could be avoided in the case of NMB. Lessons were drawn from what other banks like Nedcor and Standard Corporate and Merchant Bank (both of South Africa) have done to ensure a good measure of success in the implementation of CRM. Research was done to establish what it is that attracts customers to NMB, what NMB does better than its competitors and areas that NMB needs to improve on. Questionnaires (Appendices I and 11) were used in this regard and samples of customers from the three main sections of the bank (Treasury, Corporate Banking and Retail) were taken. The questionnaires had two sections, one with a select number of responses to choose from and the other open to unrestricted responses by the customers. The responses were analysed and presented in tabular form. Interviews were carried out on certain customers to get clarification on some responses to the questionnaires and to get firsthand feedback from different customers on their relationship with the bank. The major study findings were that customers greatly appreciate the personal attention that they are getting from NMB, which gave it an edge over its competitors. Customers value the fact that they can speak confidently to their bank knowing that their <b>allocated</b> <b>Account</b> Relationship Manager fully understands their business and that they have specific person/s to contact in the case of need. Regular visits and contact by NMB personnel was also cited as a strength. In one case, a customer related during an interview that no one from the previous bank had visited him in two years despite the fact that his office was less than one hundred meters from that bank! The study recommends a phased implementation of CRM with technology used as a tool and not as a champion of CRM. The emphasis is to be placed on the customer, the bank staff, the operational processes and maintaining the bank's strategy in focus. Unless all in the bank (from messenger to the CEO) share the same view of the customer's importance, CRM will be destined to fail due to inconsistencies within the system. On the other hand, unless the bank has a motivated, well informed and customer focused work force, then it is in vain that it is pursuing CRM. Operational processes too, must be refined with the primary objective of benefiting the customer and not merely for the convenience of the bank. The bank's strategy must keep customer interests at the fore since customers are the cause of the bank's existence...|$|E

40|$|The Australian Government {{uses the}} means-test {{as a way}} of {{managing}} the pension budget. Changes in Age Pension policy impose difficulties in retirement modelling due to policy risk, but any major changes tend to be `grandfathered' meaning that current retirees are exempt from the new changes. In 2015, two important changes were made in regards to <b>allocated</b> pension <b>accounts</b> [...] the income means-test is now based on deemed income rather than account withdrawals, and the income-test deduction no longer applies. We examine the implications of the new changes in regards to optimal decisions for consumption, investment, and housing. We account for regulatory minimum withdrawal rules that are imposed by regulations on <b>allocated</b> pension <b>accounts,</b> as well as the 2017 asset-test rebalancing. The new policy changes are modelled in a utility maximizing lifecycle model and solved as an optimal stochastic control problem. We find that the new rules decrease the benefits from planning the consumption in relation to the means-test, while the housing allocation increases slightly in order to receive additional Age Pension. The difference in optimal drawdown between the old and new policy are only noticeable early in retirement until regulatory minimum withdrawal rates are enforced. However, the amount of extra Age Pension received for many households is now significantly different due to the new deeming income rules, which benefit slightly wealthier households who previously would receive no Age Pension due to the income-test and minimum withdrawals.

40|$|In {{a robust}} {{telecommunications}} network, additional capacity must be <b>allocated</b> to <b>account</b> for restoration routing {{after the loss}} of a network component. Joint capacity optimization takes into account the relationship between working paths and restoration paths in order to generate robust networks with less total capacity than when the capacity for working and restoration paths are optimized sequentially. This paper uses experimental design methodology to show that joint optimization always yielded much better capacity solutions (> 25 % improvement) and that changing network characteristics had little effect on the per cent improvement of joint over sequential optimization. However, as network connectivity and edge capacities increase, total capacity requirements decrease for both methods and subsequently the total capacity benefit of JCA over SCA decreases. The experimental design approach is used to mathematically model the effects of, and interactions between, demand distribution, average node degree, fiber-pairs per edge, and algorithm type. The model is shown to accurately predict, within an average of 5 %, the total capacity needed at intermediate demand levels...|$|R

The supply chains that support online retailing are {{fundamentally different from}} those that support traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Traditional solutions are not always appropriate to solve online retailing’s operations problems; thus, {{there is an opportunity}} to understand and improve these novel supply chains. One key characteristic of the inventory systems for online retailing is demand spillover, whereby a stockout at a fulfillment center (FC) results in demand spilling over to another FC. For this context we examine how to allocate inventory to the FCs under a periodic-review joint-replenishment policy, with an objective to minimize outbound shipping costs for a fixed amount of inventory. We first show how traditional decentralized allocation policies may perform suboptimally and induce dynamics (whiplash) that result in costly spillover. We find that this phenomenon increases with the prevalence of local stockouts and with the level of inventory imbalance. We then describe that inventory imbalance occurs in online retailing because of operational realities and provide evidence based on real data. Finally, we propose a heuristic to <b>allocate</b> inventory <b>accounting</b> for possible spillover during the lead time. We test the heuristic by a simulation and show that it performs better than the status quo policy, is robust to operational realities, and captures over 90 % of the possible improvement as compared to a pseudo-optimal policy...|$|R

The TSP is a defined contribution retirement plan available to eligible federal employees. The TSP had about 2. 6 million participants and held about $ 100. 6 billion in Net Assets Available for Benefits as of December 31, 2001, and about 3 million participants and $ 102. 3 billion in Net Assets Available for Benefits as of December 31, 2002. In 1997, the Board awarded a contract to American Management Systems, Inc. (AMS) {{to develop and implement}} a new record-keeping system for the TSP. In 2001, after several implementation delays, the Board terminated the contract, and the Board's former Executive Director filed a lawsuit against the contractor on behalf of the TSP. On June 20, 2003, 2 days after we provided a draft of this report to the Board for its review, a settlement between the parties was reached. Then, on June 23, 2003, the net unrecovered cost from the system development failure was <b>allocated</b> to participant <b>account</b> balances as recommended in our draft report.

Since the TSP is an important component of retirement income for many federal employees, participants must be assured of proper accounting of their funds. Therefore, Congress asked us to examine federal oversight of the TSP and the TSP's accounting for its failed system development costs. Our report on federal oversight of the TSP was issued in April 2003. This report addresses whether (1) the TSP's management followed U.
