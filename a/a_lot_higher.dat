2500|$|Voltage {{regulators}} or stabilizers {{are used}} to compensate for voltage fluctuations in mains power. Large regulators may be permanently installed on distribution lines. [...] Small portable regulators may be plugged in between sensitive equipment and a wall outlet. Automatic voltage regulators are used on generator sets on ships, in emergency power supplies, on oil rigs, etc. to stabilize fluctuations in power demand. For example, when a large machine is turned on, the demand for power is suddenly <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>higher.</b> The voltage regulator compensates for the change in load. Commercial voltage regulators normally operate {{on a range of}} voltages, for example 150–240V or 90–280V.

30|$|The {{ability to}} couple the contact {{opportunity}} trigger pattern with {{another type of}} pattern using KauNet's time-driven mode is a very convenient feature {{that can be used}} in various other scenarios. For example, in a DTN space scenario such as the one described in [18], contact opportunities correspond to the low earth orbit satellite UK-DMC passing above a ground-station, for a duration of 5 to 14 minutes. During each pass, delay and throughput are constant while the bit error rate varies <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> (<b>high</b> BER at the start and the end of the pass, when the satellite elevation is low). This can be emulated with a bit-errors insertion pattern coupled with a high-sensitivity contact trigger pattern.|$|R
