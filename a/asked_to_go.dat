5|$|Phips finally sailed for England on November 17. Increase Mather was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{along in}} support but decided against it, citing the {{difficulty}} of the journey, though his diary from the time is full of yearning to return to England. They were still friendly, but it seems their coalition and partnership was in tatters.|$|E
5|$|Sorrell {{explained}} that, {{during the}} marketing campaign, the team were frequently <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to graveyards for photo-shoots. These usually went without incident, but {{on one occasion}} a vicar asked them why they were filming on church property. They lied by telling him that they were students filming a documentary on churches. Marketing campaigns also incorporated Sony Cambridge Studio's humour.|$|E
5|$|Lucas Fitzgerald {{admits to}} Mark {{that he is}} {{involved}} in illegal races, and Mark goes undercover to catch the gang. Mark eventually catches the ringleader of the illegal races, Garland Cole (Jack Finsterer), after he asks Lucas to rebirth some cars for him. After Rebecca admits to pushing Paul, Kate confesses to giving her a false alibi. Mark breaks up with her, but he becomes jealous when it appears she is moving on with Kyle Canning. Mark briefly moves in with Toadfish Rebecchi, when his home has to be fumigated, and becomes a role model to his son, Callum (Morgan Baker). Kyle turns to Mark for help when he is blackmailed by corrupt policeman Wes Holland. Mark does not initially believe Kyle, but after seeing Holland taking a bribe, Mark arrests him. Some of Mark's colleagues turn against him. He has a one-night stand with Jade Mitchell and Kate struggles to forgive him. Mark is targeted with small acts of revenge for arresting Holland. Things escalate and Mark is <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into witness protection until the trial. Mark asks Kate {{to go with him}} and she agrees. However, she misses the deadline and Mark leaves without her. Shortly afterwards Toadie overhears a conversation at the police station and learns Mark has been killed. He is forbidden from telling anyone, but ultimately convinces the superintendent to tell Kate, who is heartbroken.|$|E

25|$|The {{family and}} friends lacked {{the amount of money}} {{required}} to travel to Chittagong to Alipore Jail of Calcutta. Since at that time Pritilata was staying in Kolkata, she was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Alipore Jail and meet Ramkrishna Biswas.|$|E

25|$|Stephan Jones {{was accused}} of being {{involved}} in the Georgetown deaths, and was placed in a Guyanese prison for three months. Tim Jones and Johnny Cobb, another member of the Peoples Temple basketball team, were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Jonestown and help identify the bodies of people who had died. After returning to the United States, Jim Jones Jr. was placed under police surveillance for several months while he lived with his older sister, Suzanne, who had previously turned against the Temple.|$|E
25|$|While in Tokyo, Soong Ai-ling {{had married}} H. H. Kung, a wealthy banker, {{and it was}} no longer {{suitable}} for her to work as Sun Yat-Sen's secretary. Instead, Soong Ching-ling took the job in 1914 while in Tokyo. The relationship between Ching-ling and Sun soon turned romantic, and when Charlie Soong moved his family back to Shanghai in 1916, they secretly kept in touch. It was however problematic to pursue this relationship, as Sun was already married. Thus, Charlie was outraged when Ching-ling <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to Japan to join Sun. When she then defied him and escaped on a boat to Tokyo {{in the middle of the}} night, it was enough for Charlie to break all ties with Sun and disown his daughter.|$|E
25|$|Christie was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to {{the hotel}} to {{identify}} his wife. She apparently did not recognise him until later, when she was recovering at her sister's house, Abney Hall. Christie issued {{a statement to the}} press saying that his wife was suffering from a nervous disorder and that she had complete loss of memory. The 1979 dramatic film Agatha was based on this event with Agatha and Archie portrayed by Vanessa Redgrave and Timothy Dalton. After this, the couple separated. Agatha went to live in a flat in London, and Christie remained at Styles so that he could sell it. In 1928, Christie married Nancy Neele in St George's, Hanover Square, with just a few close friends present at the ceremony.|$|E

[...] In 2005 while on the Foozer tour, Weezer often changed the lyric <b>to</b> [...] "I <b>asked</b> you <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Foo Fighters concert" [...] and changed it to [...] "the Weezer concert" [...] in late '05. During their stop in Chicago for Lollapalooza, this was again changed <b>to</b> [...] "I <b>asked</b> you <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Pixies concert", who were playing just before Weezer on a nearby stage. At the Panic! at the Disco and Weezer 2016 Summer Tour, the line was sung [...] "I <b>asked</b> you <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Panic concert".|$|R
25|$|The {{seeds for}} the American {{involvement}} in Jaffna were laid by The Rev. Samuel Newell in 1813. He {{and his wife}} Harriet Newell were sent out by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Mission in India in 1813. As {{it was just after}} the Anglo-American war of 1812, the suspicious British authorities in Calcutta asked them to leave. The Newells were then <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Mauritius but Samuel Newell lost his only child and wife in Mauritius. From there he left for British-held Ceylon, now known as Sri Lanka. He landed in Galle and ended up in Jaffna city. Although {{he spent most of his}} career in India, particularly Bombay he was instrumental in starting up the American missionary involvement in Jaffna.|$|E
25|$|Ratti, a scholar, {{intended}} {{to work for}} Poland and build bridges to the Soviet Union, hoping even to shed his blood for Russia. Pope Benedict XV needed him as a diplomat {{and not as a}} martyr and forbade any trip into the USSR even though he was the official papal delegate to Russia. However, he continued his contacts with Russia. This did not generate much sympathy for him within Poland at the time. He was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> “While he tried honestly to show himself as a friend of Poland, Warsaw forced his departure after his neutrality in Silesian voting was questioned” by Germans and Poles. Nationalistic Germans objected to a Polish nuncio supervising elections, and Poles were upset because he curtailed agitating clergy. On 20 November, when German Cardinal Adolf Bertram announced a papal ban on all political activities of clergymen, calls for Ratti's expulsion climaxed in Warsaw. Two years later, Achille Ratti became Pope Pius XI, shaping Vatican policies towards Poland with Pietro Gasparri and Eugenio Pacelli for the following 36 years (1922–1958).|$|E
25|$|Between 1 and 6 November, while German {{forces were}} being {{concentrated}} for the attack, the German air offensive was temporarily halted. During the same period, ships and submarines brought to Leros another 1,280 men and 213 tons of supplies, including ammunition. On 3 November, German landing craft were concentrated in Laurium, and between 6 and 10 November they {{were transferred to}} Kos and Kalimnos. On 5 November, Brigadier Robert Tilney arrived in Leros and assumed command; also Major-General H. R. Hall arrived, and replaced Brittorous, who left for Alexandria (Hall would leave for Samos on the night between 11 and 12 November). Mascherpa was not forewarned of the substitution; he was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Cairo to discuss {{the situation on the}} island, but he refused, fearing {{that he would not be}} allowed to go back to Leros to lead the defense. Relations between Mascherpa and Tilney were tense from the beginning; upon arrival, Tilney stated that the Italian forces would not take part in any counterattack or have any initiative, relegating them to tasks of fixed coastal defense (with order not to abandon their positions for any reason), and put each sector of the defense under a British colonel. The British commando even asked for Mascherpa to be substituted, and Supermarina decided to replace him with Captain Dairetti, but this was never carried out due to subsequent events.|$|E

500|$|On November 13, delegates {{voted to}} create a regular army and named Sam Houston its commander-in-chief. In an effort to attract volunteers from the United States, {{soldiers}} would be granted land bounties. [...] This provision was significant, as all public land was owned by the state or the federal government, indicating that the delegates expected Texas to eventually declare independence. [...] Houston was given no authority over the volunteer army led by Austin, which predated the Consultation. [...] Houston was also appointed to the Select Committee on Indian Affairs. [...] Three men, including Austin, were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the United States to gather money, volunteers, and supplies. [...] The delegates elected Henry Smith as governor. [...] On November 14, the Consultation adjourned, leaving Smith and the Council in charge.|$|E
500|$|On 22 March 2016, a fatal {{accident}} occured off Pasir Ris MRT station. Two of SMRT's track-maintenance trainee staff were lethally {{run over by}} an approaching C151 at a signalling box of the station. They {{were part of a}} technical team of 15 staff led by a supervisor and were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down to the tracks to investigate an alarm triggered by a possible signalling equipment fault close by Pasir Ris station. The operator said the team had permission to access the tracks, but did not coordinate with a signal unit in the Pasir Ris station control to ensure train captains in the area where the team was exercised caution while pulling into Pasir Ris Station. This incident resulted in a 2.5 hour service delay between Tanah Merah and Pasir Ris Stations, affecting at least 10,000 commuters.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Traktor, a Swedish directing team known for several TV advertisements. It was filmed from August 22–27, 2002 at Hollywood Center Studios in Hollywood, California. The total production costs for the video was around $6.1million ($million in [...] dollars), making it the second most expensive music video ever made, after [...] "Scream" [...] by Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson. In an interview with Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet, Ole Sanders from Traktor recalled that in May 2002 Madonna sent them a handwritten letter, along with a demo version of [...] "Die Another Day". The team was in Prague, shooting a music video for The Prodigy. [...] "We {{thought it was a}} joke, since the letter was long and handwritten. But the song sounded suspiciously like her," [...] Sanders explained. He was then <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Pinewood Studios in London to watch a half-finished version of the Bond film with producer Barbara Broccoli. Later, Sanders and one of his colleagues invited Madonna to their London home to discuss the video. By summer 2002, he had compiled the idea for the video with Madonna's inputs in it: ...|$|E

500|$|Both {{necklaces}} {{consist of}} a single row of large graduated [...] pearls with pearl clasps. The Queen Anne necklace {{is said to have}} belonged to Queen Anne, the last British monarch of the Stuart dynasty. Horace Walpole, the English art historian, wrote in his diary, [...] "Queen Anne had but few jewels and those indifferent, except one pearl necklace given to her by Prince George". Queen Caroline, on the other hand, {{had a great deal of}} valuable jewellery, including no fewer than four pearl necklaces. She wore all the pearl necklaces to her coronation in 1727, but afterwards had the 50 best pearls selected to make one large necklace. In 1947, both necklaces were given to Elizabeth by her father as a wedding present. On her wedding day, Elizabeth realised that she had left her pearls at St James's Palace. Her private secretary, Jock Colville, was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and retrieve them. He commandeered the limousine of King Haakon VII of Norway, but traffic that morning had stopped, so even the king's car with its royal flag flying could not get anywhere. Colville completed his journey on foot, and when he arrived at St James's Palace, he had to explain the odd story to the guards who were protecting Elizabeth's 2,660 wedding presents. They let him in after finding his name on a guest list, and he was able to get the pearls to the princess in time for her portrait in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace.|$|E
500|$|Despite her isolation, Charlotte found life at Cranbourne Lodge {{surprisingly}} agreeable, {{and slowly}} became reconciled to her situation. [...] At {{the end of}} July 1814, the Prince Regent visited Charlotte in her isolation and informed her {{that her mother was}} about to leave England for an extended stay on the Continent. [...] This upset Charlotte, but she did not feel that anything she might say could change her mother's mind, and was further aggrieved by her mother's casualness in the leavetaking, [...] "for God knows how long, or what events may occur before we meet again". [...] Charlotte would never see her mother again. [...] In late August, Charlotte was permitted to go to the seaside. [...] She had <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to fashionable Brighton, but the Prince Regent refused, sending her instead to Weymouth. [...] As the Princess's coach stopped along the way, large, friendly crowds gathered to see her; according to Holme, [...] "her affectionate welcome shows that already people thought of her as their future Queen". [...] On arrival in Weymouth, there were illuminations with a centrepiece [...] "Hail Princess Charlotte, Europe's Hope and Britain's Glory". [...] Charlotte spent time exploring nearby attractions, shopping for smuggled French silks, and from late September taking a course of heated seawater baths. [...] She was still infatuated with her Prussian, and hoped in vain that he would declare his interest in her to the Prince Regent. If he did not do so, she wrote to a friend, she would [...] "take the next best thing, which was a good tempered man with good sence ... that man is the P of S-C" [...] In mid-December, shortly before leaving Weymouth, she [...] "had a very sudden and great shock" [...] when she received news that her Prussian had formed another attachment. [...] In a long talk after Christmas dinner, father and daughter made up their differences.|$|E
