40|$|Previously {{published}} {{as a special}} issue of West European Politics, this edited volume evaluates {{the extent to which}} a policy gap between inputs and outcomes exists with regard to immigration control. In exploring an expanded migration policy-field which includes the extreme right, the media and actors, this book goes beyond traditional analyses that focus on classical moments of policy making and instead seeks to understand the normative and cognitive context in which they operate. Taking into account the recent work of migration scholars into variants of the disjuncture theme, the comparative studies also highlight the variations across time, countries, regions and sectors. The international list of contributors discuss refugee protection, <b>asylum</b> <b>and</b> illegal <b>migration</b> in chapters that fall under three subject areas: •formulating policy •implementing policy •international policy making.

40|$|This article aims at {{applying}} Derrida’s views {{displayed in}} his work “Hostipitality” to the issues of <b>asylum</b> <b>and</b> refugee and also providing an exposition of the asylum’s philosophy by this way. In the text, in addition to taking into consideration the translation indicated in the deepnote, texts that discusses Derrida’s views on deconstruction {{in the context of}} ethics and politics are also referred to and hospitality’s linguistic practices in the local culture (Turkish culture) such as aphorisms and proverbs are revealed as short texts. The exploration held illustrates that the matter of <b>asylum</b> <b>and</b> refugee is neither ethical nor political nor cultural, on the contrary it is the probability amplitude (or state vector) which includes more than their collecitons. When resolved through deconstructive techniques, being a refugee, which starts with seeking asylum, seems to include both linguistic and political apoiras. In order to overcome “refugeeism as a problem”, the aporias of binary/oppositional thinking should be perceived, totally-originally different thinking should be appealed within the multi-valued logical thinking and it should initiate “thinking the unthinkable” as Derrida suggests by abandoning the system thought. The small linguistic difference between hospitality and hostility pointed out by Derrida invites to re-think on the presence of hostility supperessed in the concept of hospitality, and invites to reconsideration those who are dealing with especially the matters of <b>asylum</b> <b>and</b> refugeeism, <b>migration</b> <b>and</b> policy of <b>migration,</b> ends <b>and</b> universality and even those known as hospitable. The main question whose answer is sought in all of them is as such: Is hospitality possible?...|$|R
