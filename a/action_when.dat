5|$|Holkar {{was offered}} terms {{similar to those}} offered to Shinde; the only {{difference}} was that Holkar accepted and respected the independence of Amir Khan. The Court of Holkar was at this time practically nonexistent. When Tantia Jog, {{an official of the}} Holkar, urged acceptance of the offer he was suspected of being in collusion with the British. In reality he made the suggestion because he was aware {{of the power of the}} British as he had seen their armies in <b>action</b> <b>when</b> he had commanded a battalion in the past. Holkar responded to the Peshwa's call for insurrection against the British by initiating a battle in Mahidpur.|$|E
5|$|In October 1899, he saw {{his first}} combat <b>action</b> <b>when</b> he led 300 Marines to take the town of Noveleta, from Filipino rebels known as Insurrectos. In the initial moments of the assault, his first {{sergeant}} was wounded. Butler briefly panicked, but quickly regained his composure and led his Marines {{in pursuit of the}} fleeing enemy. By noon the Marines had dispersed the rebels and taken the town. One Marine had been killed and ten were wounded. Another 50 Marines had been incapacitated by the humid tropical heat.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 2010, a {{military}} court convicted {{air traffic controller}} Sgt.

5|$|Ross Andrew McGinnis (June 14, 1987December 4, 2006) was a United States Army {{soldier who}} was killed in the Iraq War and was posthumously awarded the United States' highest {{decoration}} for bravery, the Medal of Honor. While serving as the gunner in a HMMWV, his convoy was attacked and a hand grenade was thrown into his vehicle. McGinnis was subsequently killed in <b>action</b> <b>when</b> he deliberately threw himself on the grenade, saving the lives of at least four other soldiers in the vehicle. He was the fourth soldier to receive the Medal of Honor during the Iraq War, which was presented to his family following his death.|$|E
5|$|The film debuted at the Broadway Theater on June 15, 1917. After its debut, {{the film}} {{received}} many bids from buyers for the film.

5|$|The tip of {{the tongue}} {{probably}} acts as a suction cup and during lapping, nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary <b>action.</b> <b>When</b> at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the tongue, the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn by experience which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like Bombus bifarius, have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, B. bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct, {{which resulted in a}} small reward.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{began to}} play with purpose once going behind, {{but for the rest}} of the half {{struggled}} to get the better of Luton's defence. A long ball by Davis sent Rocastle charging forward in the 16th minute, and momentarily upset Luton's shape, but it was caught by Dibble. The Luton goalkeeper was again called into <b>action</b> <b>when</b> Arsenal were awarded a set piece; Sansom slid the ball to Nigel Winterburn, whose shot was gathered. Foster made a timely challenge on Davis on the edge of the penalty area to end another Arsenal attack; Graham's team had been more threatening on right-hand flank with Rocastle and Winterburn. Harford, who had been a long figure up front for Luton, still managed to trouble the Arsenal defence with little service; near the end of the first half, he collected a pass from the left, bypassed his marker Adams and aimed his shot at goal, which went wide of the right-hand post.|$|E
5|$|At 03:00 on 2 July the Allied {{advance guard}} {{began to break}} camp for the march towards Donauwörth and the Schellenberg heights. Marlborough {{personally}} oversaw the advance of the initial assault force of 5,850 foot, drawn up in groups of approximately 130 men from each battalion under his command. The Dutch General Johan Wijnand van Goor would lead this vanguard. Behind these stormers came 12,000 Allied infantry in two echelons, each of eight battalions (English, Dutch, Hanoverian and Hessian) under Major General Henry Withers and Count Horn, supported by Henry Lumley's and Graf Reynard van Hompesch's 35 squadrons of British and Dutch cavalry and dragoons. Baden, whose wing of the army marched behind Marlborough's, would hold a brigade of Imperial grenadiers ready for <b>action</b> <b>when</b> the opportunity came as there was insufficient room {{in front of the}} Schellenberg for them to fully deploy. In all, the Allies were deploying 22,000 men in the operation.|$|E

5|$|He was {{employed}} on home {{service for the}} next ten years and whilst serving as regimental adjutant was promoted to captain on 22 April 1891, attending Staff College before being transferred with his unit to India. It was in India that Capper saw his first <b>action,</b> <b>when</b> in 1895 his regiment was attached to a force sent to the Indian-Afghan border to relieve a trapped British force in Chitral. Three years later he was again in action as an advisor to an Egyptian unit of the Anglo-Egyptian army under Horatio Kitchener which travelled down the Nile in the final campaign of the Mahdist War. During these operations, Capper participated in the battle of Atbara and was with the force which fought in the culminating Battle of Omdurman. He received a brevet promotion as major on 16 November 1898.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Allen became {{chairman}} of the MCC's Cricket Committee. The committee looked at ways to improve cricket, for example analysing whether reducing {{the size of the}} ball would help bowlers. Allen also began to pursue bowlers with illegal bowling actions; commentators were aware that this was a growing issue but no action had been taken, and Allen took the lead. Three English bowlers were no-balled for throwing in 1959 and another five in 1960. Geoff Griffin, a bowler who toured England with the South African team in 1960, was perceived to have a suspect action; when the bowler was no-balled for throwing in a Test match, the South African press suggested that Allen had played a prominent part. Later that year, Allen met Bradman, Australia's representative at the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC); the pair wanted to ensure that bowling actions would be fair in future, and the ICC agreed to take <b>action.</b> <b>When</b> Australia toured England in 1961, no bowlers whose actions had been questioned were included in either team. Allen later took the lead in re-drafting the law on throwing.|$|E
5|$|Krug {{strongly}} opposed {{the notion that}} libraries ought to censor the material that they provide to patrons.

When the United States Department of Justice used {{the authority of the}} USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 to conduct searches of once-confidential library databases, Krug raised a public outcry against this government <b>action.</b> <b>When</b> shortly after the September 11 attacks a Florida librarian told police that one of the attackers had been using the Delray Beach public libraryalthough Florida law guarantees confidentiality to library patronsKrug criticized the action. She stated she wished the librarian had adhered to Florida law, but empathized with the situation and said that most individuals would likely have done the same thing.|$|E

5|$|McCudden's {{long-term}} interest in mechanics {{prompted him to}} modify his own aircraft to increase combat performance. He {{made a series of}} modifications to his aircraft which caused them to excel in performance in comparison to any other S.E.5 at the front and perhaps any other German fighter available at the time. Performance, a generic term, required improvements in all-round capability. McCudden's changes were made with one main objective in mind: high-altitude performance. He had achieved some success without these personal experiments. On 23 December 1917, for example, he intercepted an enemy aircraft at 18,000 feet and drove it down to 8,000 feet before shooting it down for his 30th victory. Incidentally, he was nearly killed in <b>action</b> <b>when</b> one of the wings broke away from his victim and nearly struck his own aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are opportunistic predators, catching prey which drifts {{within reach}} of their tentacles. The prey is secured {{with the help of}} sticky mucus, spirocysts (non-venomous harpoon cells) and nematocysts (venomous harpoon cells). The tentacles then bend to push larger prey into the mouth, while smaller, plankton-size prey, is moved by cilia to the tip of the tentacles which are then inserted into the mouth. The mouth can stretch to accommodate large items, and in some species, the lips may extend to help receive the prey. The pharynx then grasps the prey, which is mixed with mucus and slowly swallowed by peristalsis and ciliary <b>action.</b> <b>When</b> the food reaches the coelenteron, extracellular digestion is initiated by the discharge of the septa-based nematocysts and the release of enzymes. The partially digested food fragments are circulated in the coelenteron by cilia, and from here they are taken up by phagocytosis by the gastrodermal cells that line the cavity.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, it {{was mainly}} food that the {{inhabitants}} of Jerusalem needed. Starting 5 June, the Israeli engineers started to fix the road so that it let civil transport trucks pass to supply the city. 150 workers, working in four teams, installed a pipeline to supply the city with water, because the other pipeline, crossing Latrun, had been cut by the Jordanians. In O Jerusalem, Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins talked about heroic <b>action,</b> <b>when</b> during the night of 6–7 June, in fear of the critical situation of Jerusalem and to improve {{the morale of the}} population, 300 inhabitants of Tel Aviv were requisitioned to carry on their backs, for the few kilometers not yet ready for the trucks, what would be needed to feed {{the inhabitants of}} Jerusalem one more day.|$|E
