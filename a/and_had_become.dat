5|$|London {{had been}} a Roman {{settlement}} for four centuries <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> progressively more crowded inside its defensive city wall. It had also pushed outwards beyond the wall into squalid extramural slums such as Shoreditch, Holborn, and Southwark, and had reached far enough to include the independent City of Westminster.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 2013 it was {{announced}} that the Jumbotron screens were to be replaced; the previous screens were inferior <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> pixelated. On 16 July 2014 the club paid a lasting tribute to Sandy Jardine by renaming the Govan Stand in his honour.|$|E
5|$|The WCHL rebranded {{itself the}} Western Hockey League (WHL) and the Crescents became the Sheiks in 1925–26. Cook again led in both goals and points with 31 and 44 respectively, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> {{known as the}} best right wing in hockey.|$|E

5|$|After this, the Tibetan people's {{trade in}} tiger skins became a {{relatively}} more important threat to tigers. The pelts {{were used in}} clothing, tiger-skin chuba being worn by singers and participants in horse racing festivals, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> status symbols. In 2004, international conservation organizations launched successful environmental propaganda campaigns in China against the Tibetan tiger skin trade. There was outrage in India, where many Tibetans live, and the 14th Dalai Lama was persuaded {{to take up the}} issue. Since then there has been a change of attitude, with some Tibetans publicly burning their chubas.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Lambert's return to Leicester, his weight began to {{increase}} steadily, {{even though he was}} athletically active and, by his own account, abstained from drinking alcohol and did not eat unusual amounts of food. In 1805, Lambert's gaol closed. By this time, he weighed , <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> the heaviest authenticated person up to that point in recorded history. Unemployable and sensitive about his bulk, Lambert became a recluse.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, the {{graveyard}} was full <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> {{a public health}} concern. It was overrun with rats, and dogs chasing the rats, {{both of which were}} damaging the churchyard. Finding sufficient ground for new burials was increasingly difficult and bones were often removed to a nearby charnel house. In 1849, an extra charge was put on burials of people from outside the parish. In 1884, the churchyard was closed to all burials and a cemetery was opened in the town.|$|E

5|$|D. P. Kirby {{uses the}} {{presence}} of East Anglian princesses living under the veil in Gaul {{as evidence of the}} Frankish orientation of Anna's kingdom at this time, continued since the reign of his predecessor Rædwald. The Wuffingas dynasty may have been connected with monastic foundations in the area around Faramoutiers through Anna's predecessor Sigeberht, who had spent several years as an exile in Gaul <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> a devout and learned Christian due to his experiences of monastic life.|$|E

Later that day the JMA {{reported that}} Typhoon Choi-wan had reached its 10-minute peak wind speeds of 195km/h (120mph) and a pressure of 915hPa (mbar). Typhoon Choi-wan then intensified further and reached its peak 1-minute wind speeds of 260km/h (160mph) which made it the first Category 5-equivalent tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale {{anywhere in the world}} in 2009.|$|E

5|$|In May 1840, {{while serving}} as Prince Sturdza's private secretary, he became co-director (with Alecsandri and Negruzzi) of the National Theater Iași. This {{followed}} the monarch's decision to unite the two existing theaters in the city, one of which hosted plays in French, into a single institution. In later years, this venue, which staged popular comedies based on the French repertory of its age <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> {{the most popular of}} its kind in the country, also hosted Alecsandri's debut as a playwright. Progressively, it also became subject to Sturdza's censorship.|$|E

5|$|Morris found batting {{difficult}} {{for the first few}} weeks of the tour, as he struggled to adapt to the unfamiliar batting conditions. He reached 50 only twice in the nine innings after the Worcestershire match, totalling only 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly, he was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> fidgety and shuffled across the crease.|$|E
5|$|Murasaki wrote The Diary of Lady Murasaki, {{a volume}} of poetry, and The Tale of Genji. Within a decade of its completion, Genji was {{distributed}} throughout the provinces; within a century it was recognized as a classic of Japanese literature <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> a subject of scholarly criticism. Early in the 20th century her work was translated; a six-volume English translation was completed in 1933. Scholars continue to {{recognize the importance of}} her work, which reflects Heian court society at its peak.

5|$|The Palace Pier was {{constructed}} {{as a replacement}} for the Chain Pier, which collapsed in 1896 during construction. It quickly became popular, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> a frequently-visited theatre and entertainment venue by 1911. Aside from closures owing to war, it continued to hold regular entertainment up to the 1970s. The theatre was damaged in 1973 and following a buy-out was demolished in 1986, changing the pier's character from seaside entertainment to an amusement park, with various fairground rides and roller coasters.|$|E
5|$|The metal {{pipework}} {{was stolen}} after {{the closure of}} the chapel, and, as part of the restoration project discussed above, it was decided to bring in a replacement instrument.

5|$|Arriving in Iaşi (Jassy) in 1876, Goldfaden was {{fortunate}} to be better known as a good poet — many of whose poems had been set to music <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> popular songs — than as a less-than-successful businessman. Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was {{just a way to}} starve; she suggested {{that there would be a}} lot more of a market for Yiddish-language theater. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital of his songs in the garden of Shimen Mark, Grădina Pomul Verde ("the Green Fruit-Tree Garden").|$|E
