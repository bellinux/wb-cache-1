5|$|A vulcanoid is an {{asteroid}} {{in a stable}} orbit with a semi-major axis {{less than that of}} Mercury (i.e. 0.387AU). This does not include objects like sungrazing comets, which, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> perihelia inside the orbit of Mercury, have far greater semi-major axes.|$|E

5|$|Abbott {{has created}} several games, {{including}} card games, board games, and one equipment game. As a whole, his games {{are not of}} particular fame, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> some unique elements that set them apart from mainstream games. For instance, the card game Metamorphosis is a complex trick-taking game. As you play the game, the rules change three times, so {{it is as if}} you are playing four different games that are threaded together.|$|E
5|$|European nightjars hunt by sight, silhouetting {{their prey}} against the night sky. They tend to flycatch from a perch on moonlit nights, but fly {{continuously}} on darker nights when prey {{is harder to}} see. Hunting frequency reduces {{in the middle of}} the night. <b>Although</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> very small bills, the mouth can be opened very wide as they catch insects. They have long sensitive bristles around the mouth, which may help to locate or funnel prey into the mouth. Indigestible parts of insects, such as the chitin exoskeleton, are regurgitated as pellets.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen years later, {{after his}} wife dies, van Kempen and Ervine return to the Indies. He has been hired as a {{supervisor}} at another plantation, not far from his old place of work. He searches for Siti and the couple's children, but none of his old coworkers know where they are. Unbeknownst to van Kempen, his children have been raised as natives and wear the traditional clothes, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> also received a Western education. Adolf has become a hunter, while Annie stays {{at home with their}} mother.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{the site}} hosted eleven {{different}} residential halls and pavilions; in 2012 only three are left, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been completely reconstructed: The Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall, the Moon Satharn Borom Ard Hall and the Sommuthi Thevaraj Uppabat Hall. Behind these structures lie the grand Borom Ratchasathit Mahoran Hall, {{which has been}} recently rebuilt. None of the rooms {{are open to the}} public, as state functions are still carried out within. The changing of the guards occurs at the front courtyard every two hours.|$|E
5|$|Other highly {{specialized}} feeders include cookiecutter sharks, which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and marine mammals. Cookiecutter teeth are enormous {{compared to the}} animal's size. The lower teeth are particularly sharp. <b>Although</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> never been observed feeding, they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal, twisting their bodies to rip off flesh.|$|E

5|$|The Fatimid Caliphs {{competed with}} {{the rulers of}} the Abbasid and Byzantine empires, and indulged in luxurious palace building. Their palaces, their {{greatest}} architectural achievements, are known only by written descriptions, however. Several surviving tombs, mosques, gates and walls, mainly in Cairo, retain original elements, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been extensively modified or rebuilt in later periods. Notable extant examples of Fatimid architecture include the Great Mosque of Mahdiya, and the Al-Azhar Mosque, Al-Hakim Mosque, Juyushi and Lulua of Cairo.|$|E
5|$|The ten {{reserves}} {{existing in}} 2012 had a combined area of 6,016ha (14,863acres), 78percent of the SSSI. <b>Although</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> no legal protection {{beyond that of}} privately owned land, they may have more active management or provide visitor facilities. The mixed ownership reflects land becoming available for purchase or management at various times, and the differing priorities of the conservation bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{two most}} useful {{properties}} of the metal are corrosion resistance and strength-to-density ratio, the highest of any metallic element. In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, but less dense. There are two allotropic forms and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element, 46Ti through 50Ti, with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8%). <b>Although</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{the same number of}} valence electrons and are in the same group in the periodic table, titanium and zirconium differ in many chemical and physical properties.|$|E

5|$|This {{dialogue}} {{appears in}} several Hindu texts; the earliest is in chapter 2.4 – and modified in chapter 4.5 – of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, {{one of the}} principal and oldest Upanishads, dating from approximately 700 BCE. The Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue has survived in two manuscript recensions from the Madhyamdina and Kanva Vedic schools; <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> significant literary differences, they share the same philosophical theme.|$|E
5|$|Although calcium is in {{the same}} group as {{magnesium}} and organomagnesium compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry, organocalcium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> recently been investigated as possible catalysts. Organocalcium compounds tend to be more similar to organoytterbium compounds due to the similar ionic radii of Yb2+ (102pm) and Ca2+ (100pm). Most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures; bulky ligands tend to favor stability. For example, calcium dicyclopentadienyl, Ca(C5H5)2, must be made by directly reacting calcium metal with mercurocene or cyclopentadiene itself; replacing the C5H5 ligand with the bulkier C5(CH3)5 ligand on the other hand increases the compound's solubility, volatility, and kinetic stability.|$|E
5|$|Migrating birds rely {{largely on}} stored fat {{and they also}} metabolise protein as a {{supplementary}} source of energy. Those with a relatively large amount of fat, may make stops during migration of only 1–2 days; <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> lost weight since commencing their journey, they have enough energy reserves to reach the wintering areas. The proportion of migrating males increases as they travel south through Europe. There is competition within the species even during migration, and the larger and more aggressive males may get more food. Their death rate is therefore {{lower than that of}} the females both on the southward migration, and in resident populations.|$|E

5|$|Most fish possess highly {{developed}} sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have color vision {{that is at}} least as good as a human's (see vision in fishes). Many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of taste and smell. <b>Although</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the Ampullae of Lorenzini, organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt. Other fish, like the South American electric fishes Gymnotiformes, can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse {{have little}} {{interaction}} with people, primarily because most species live in arid unpopulated areas and at low densities. They are not generally sought after as game birds {{as they are}} not especially palatable, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> on occasion been taken in great numbers at water holes. An attempt to introduce them into Nevada failed {{but they have been}} introduced to Hawaii. No species is considered to be threatened although there have been some localised range contractions, particularly in Europe. A subspecies of the chestnut-bellied sandgrouse, P. e. floweri, was last seen in the Nile Valley of Egypt in 1979. It is thought to be extinct, but the reasons for this are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{private sector}} has {{also played a}} large role in revitalizing the area, even without public aid and incentives. Developers have been {{attracted}} to the historic buildings and their surrounding neighborhoods, calling it the city's strongest asset, <b>although</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> complained about past stalemates in city government. One initiative has often led to others. River Street's development into a center for antique stores came about without any public effort or intent, and the restoration of the music hall at the Savings Bank led to many new restaurants opening in the neighborhood. The blocks of River Street north of Monument Square have a dozen woman-owned businesses.|$|E
