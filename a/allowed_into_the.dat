5|$|The North-West Mounted Police set up control posts at {{the borders}} of the Yukon Territory or, where that was disputed, at easily {{controlled}} points such as the Chilkoot and White Passes. These units were armed with Maxim guns. Their tasks included enforcing the rules requiring that travellers bring a year's supply of food with them to be <b>allowed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Yukon Territory, checking for illegal weapons, preventing the entry of criminals and enforcing customs duties.|$|E
5|$|The Pony of the Americas Club will {{register}} {{the offspring of}} registered POAs, as well crosses with Connemaras, Galiceno ponies, Australian Stock Horses, Morgans and Thoroughbreds, and the original Appaloosa and Arabian breeds. These crosses are <b>allowed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> registry as full members {{as long as they}} meet the physical breed requirements. Crosses with other breeds, including Quarter ponies, Shetland ponies, Anglo-Arabs, Spanish Mustangs and Welsh ponies, are accepted on an individual basis.|$|E
5|$|After the Dutch {{recognised}} Indonesia's independence on 27 December1949, {{following a}} several month-long {{conference in the}} Hague, Soegijapranata returned to Semarang. The post-revolution period was marked by a drastic increase in enrolment at the nation's seminary; the 100th native Indonesian clergyman was ordained in 1956. The government, however, enacted several laws that limited the Church's ability to expand. In 1953 the Ministry for Religion decreed that no foreign missionaries would be <b>allowed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> country, and a subsequent law prohibited those already in Indonesia from teaching. In response, Soegijapranata encouraged eligible clergy to apply for Indonesian citizenship, circumventing the new laws.|$|E

5|$|Melvin's {{first problem}} {{was that there was}} no {{forensic}} evidence. Senior officers had not allowed the estate to be sealed off immediately after the attack, which meant that the crime scene had not been secured. Witnesses and those directly involved were able to leave without giving their names. Objects that might have held fingerprints were not collected. Police were not <b>allowed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> estate in great numbers until 4am, by which time much of the evidence had disappeared. Whatever remained was removed during Haringey Council's clean-up operation.|$|E
5|$|On immigration, Moran {{supported}} a pathway to citizenship {{for illegal immigrants}} and did not support decreasing the number of legal immigrants <b>allowed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> country or the enforcement of federal immigration laws by state and local police. He was a cosponsor of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform ASAP Act of 2009 (H.R.4321), which the House did not pass. He was given an overall immigration reduction grade of D by NumbersUSA. The American Immigration Lawyers Association scored him as having voted 31 times for the organization's position and 7 times against the organization's position.|$|E
5|$|The DPP {{argued that}} it was never the {{intention}} of The Chaser to breach security and that they were <b>allowed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> restricted area only because of the mistakes of the police. The laws enacted for the summit meant that entry into the restricted zone needed justification, which could include police permission. The DPP stated that by waving The Chaser through, they had granted permission to be in the restricted zone. A further defence was available: all members charged, except Morrow, could argue that they were present for work-related purposes, and part of their employment was to be with Morrow, who was directing the stunt.|$|E

5|$|The Galloway breed {{comes from}} the cattle native to the {{south-west}} region of Scotland, first fully developed in the 17th century. Originally there was much variation within this breed, including many different colours and patterns. The original Galloway herd book only registered black cattle, but the recessive gene for red colour persisted in the population, and eventually dun Galloways were also <b>allowed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> herd book. As a result, although black {{is still the most}} common colour for Galloways, they can also be red and several shades of dun. In 1877 the Galloway Cattle Society was formed.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} this episode came from Mike Reiss, {{who thought it}} would be funny if the plant went on strike. The writers of the episode, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, would later add the dental plan aspect of the plot. In several scenes, Mr. Burns is portrayed as the Devil who is tempting Homer and showing him what he could have. During the {{production}} of this episode, an ABC camera crew was <b>allowed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> rewrite room, which Al Jean says he regrets because they were working on stage direction, and they came off as not being very funny.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationships}} between Julia Maesa, Julia Soaemias, and Elagabalus were strong at first. His {{mother and grandmother}} became the first women to be <b>allowed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Senate, and both received senatorial titles: Soaemias the established title of Clarissima, and Maesa the more unorthodox Mater Castrorum et Senatus ("Mother of the army camp and of the Senate"). They held the title of Augusta as well, suggesting {{that they may have}} been the power behind the throne. Indeed, they exercised great influence over the young emperor throughout his reign, and can be found on many coins and inscriptionsâ€”a rare honor for Roman women.|$|E

5|$|As of 2011, {{there were}} 335 mares and 51 stallions {{registered}} with the Irish registry, which included 59 new foals that year. Herd numbers have steadily increased since registrations began in 2005. These numbers make the Kerry Bog Pony third in population numbers among Irish breeds, behind the Connemara pony and the Irish Draught. Despite the increasing numbers, the breed is still considered to be critically endangered by the Equus Survival Trust. The horses are administered by the Kerry Bog Pony Co-Operative Society of Ireland (formerly the Kerry Bog Pony Society), {{which is based in}} Ireland with a branch in Great Britain. Inspections are required before ponies are <b>allowed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studbook. The book is divided into four classes: Class 1 ponies meet all requirements, Class 2 ponies do not meet the height requirement, Class 3 ponies do not meet the color requirements, and Class 4 ponies have yet to submit to an official inspection. The breed association has hosted an annual breed show and sale in Glenbeigh, County Kerry since 2007.|$|E
5|$|Campervans, caravans and trailer tents are not <b>allowed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> main festival site. However, the {{purchase}} of a campervan ticket in addition to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence; and the cost includes access for the campervan or towing vehicle and the caravan; the car, or other vehicle used to tow the caravan, may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan/caravan and connected awning, not in the accompanying vehicle. One additional tent may accompany the caravan/campervan if space within the plot allows. Some people choose to bring or hire a motorhome, though drivers of larger vehicles or motorhomes may have to purchase a second campervan ticket if they cannot fit within the defined plot. The 2009 festival saw changes to the campervan fields; commercial vehicles were no longer classed as 'campervans', all campervans had to have a fitted sleeping area and either washing or cooking facilities, and caravans and trailer tents were allowed back at the festival. Prior to this only campervans were allowed on site, caravans and trailers being banned in the early 1990s after a number were stuck in the mud and abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Ruby {{founded the}} Colorado Ranger Horse Association (CRHA), and {{was granted a}} {{corporate}} charter for the association in 1938. Ruby remained president of the organization from 1935 {{until his death in}} 1942. The registry initially imposed a 50-member limit, and many Ranger horses, whose breeders were not allowed to become members, were instead registered with the Appaloosa Horse Club. The member limit was lifted in 1964, and since then pedigree research has continued to find and register horses with Ranger breeding that are un-registered or registered as Appaloosas. During the 1980s, some Lusitano blood was <b>allowed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> breed, but this practice has been discontinued. The CRHA states that up to 1 in 8 registered Appaloosas may have Colorado Ranger blood, and as such be eligible for registry with the CRHA. As of 2005, there were more than 6,000 horses registered with the CRHA, with between 100 and 125 new horses registered annually. While originally bred in the western US, today many Colorado Rangers are found in the midwest and eastern parts of the country, including the states of Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. They are also found in Canada, where {{there is at least one}} large breeding farm.|$|E

5|$|In Vaikom, a {{small town}} in Kerala state, then Travancore, there were strict laws of {{untouchability}} in and around the temple area. Dalits, also known as Harijans were not <b>allowed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> close streets around and leading to the temple, let alone inside it. Anti-caste feelings were growing and in 1924 Vaikom was chosen as a suitable place for an organised Satyagraha. Under his guidance a movement had already begun with the aim of giving all castes the right to enter the temples. Thus, agitations and demonstrations took place. On the fourteenth of April, Periyar and his wife Nagamma arrived in Vaikom. They were immediately arrested and imprisoned for participation. In spite of Gandhi's objection to non-Keralites and non-Hindus taking part, Periyar and his followers continued to give support to the movement until it was withdrawn. He received the title Vaikom Veeran, given by his followers who participated in the Satyagraha.|$|E
5|$|Kinne's {{second trial}} {{for the murder of}} James Kinne began on March 23, 1964. As jury {{selection}} got underway that day, the public was initially barred from the proceedings, but the restriction was soon loosened and the media were <b>allowed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> courtroom. An unusually long jury selection process made {{the first day of the}} trial last fourteen hours, beginning at 9 a.m. and not ending until nearly midnight the same day; presiding judge Paul Carver noted that due to the notoriety of the case, he had been forced to choose between sequestering the entire jury pool overnight and forcing the court into a long day. The eventual jury, all men, were immediately sequestered, but days later, a mistrial was declared after it emerged that a law partner of prosecutor Lawrence Gepford had once been retained by one of the jurors.|$|E
5|$|The Minister Steward (Shaofu å°‘åºœ), {{also known}} as the Privy Treasurer and Small Treasurer, served the emperor exclusively, {{providing}} him with entertainment and amusements, proper food and clothing, medicine and physical care, valuables and equipment. For this purpose he was given responsibility for the emperor's personal finances during Western Han, yet this responsibility was transferred to the Minister of Finance during Eastern Han. Although he was not a castrated eunuch, many of his subordinates were, since his ministry managed the imperial harem housing concubines. His secretaries were headed by a Prefect of the Masters of Writing (Shangshu ling å°šæ›¸ä»¤). The secretaries were responsible for relaying all written messages to the emperor, official correspondence with Excellencies, senior ministers, provincial authorities, common people who submitted memorials to the throne, and non-Han-Chinese peoples within and outside the empire. Since the Masters of Writing were not eunuchs, and thus not <b>allowed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> imperial harem, Emperor Wu established an all-eunuch office of secretaries for the inner palace, which was abolished in 29 BC.|$|E

Seeing his cover blown, Chan attacks Dredd, but is killed. Meanwhile, Kay tries to execute Anderson with her own weapon, but the pistol's DNA scanner does not recognise him and explodes, taking his arm off. She escapes and later encounters Kaplan, whom she promptly kills after reading Kaplan's mind. Elsewhere, Dredd kills Alvarez but runs out of ammunition, and is shot by Lex in the abdomen. Lex moves in to execute Dredd, but Dredd stalls him long enough for Anderson to arrive and kill Lex.|$|E
