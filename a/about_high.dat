5|$|The Americans were {{alarmed by}} the Japanese buildup, which was {{accurately}} tracked through Ultra intelligence. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson was sufficiently concerned <b>about</b> <b>high</b> American estimates of probable casualties to commission his own study by Quincy Wright and William Shockley. Wright and Shockley spoke with Colonels James McCormack and Dean Rusk, and examined casualty forecasts by Michael E. DeBakey and Gilbert Beebe. Wright and Shockley estimated the invading Allies would suffer between 1.7 and 4million casualties in such a scenario, of whom between 400,000 and 800,000 would be dead, while Japanese fatalities would have been around 5 to 10 million.|$|E
5|$|The theater {{has been}} {{credited}} {{as contributing to}} the performing arts renaissance in Chicago, and has been favorably reviewed for its acoustics, sightlines, proscenium and for providing a home base for numerous performing organizations. Although {{it is seen as}} a high caliber venue for its music audiences, the theater is regarded as less than ideal for jazz groups because it is more expensive and larger than most places where jazz is performed. The design has been criticized for traffic flow problems, with an elevator bottleneck. However, the theater's prominent location and its underground design to preserve Millennium Park have been praised. Although there were complaints <b>about</b> <b>high</b> priced events in its early years, discounted ticket programs were introduced in the 2009–10 season.|$|E

25|$|Volkswagen {{agreed in}} December 2011 to {{implement}} a rule passed by the company's works council aimed at improving work–life balance by restricting company email functionality on the firm's BlackBerry smartphones from 6:30pm to 7:30am.

About 1,150 of Volkswagen's more than 190,000 employees are affected by the email restriction.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Hughes {{said that}} his request to direct the film met with {{resistance}} and skepticism because he lacked filmmaking experience. Hughes ultimately convinced the film's investors that due to the modest $1 million budget and its single location shoot, he could greatly minimize their risk. Hughes originally thought that The Breakfast Club would be his directorial debut. Hughes opted for an insular, largely one room set and wrote it <b>about</b> <b>high</b> school students, who would be played by younger actors.|$|E

25|$|Resistance {{from the}} {{military}} command and concerns <b>about</b> <b>high</b> production cost were finally overcome by anxieties about the poor performance of Soviet tanks in the Winter War in Finland, {{and the effectiveness of}} German tanks during the Battle of France. The first production T-34s were completed in September 1940, completely replacing the production of the T-26, the BT series, and the multi-turreted T-28 medium tank at the KhPZ plant. Koshkin died of pneumonia (exacerbated by the drive from Kharkiv to Moscow) {{at the end of that}} month, and the T-34's drivetrain developer, Alexander Morozov, was appointed Chief Designer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the city}} of Gobir, Usman dan Fodio (1754–1817) accused the Hausa {{leadership}} of practicing an impure version of Islam and of being morally corrupt. In 1804, he launched the Fulani War as a jihad among a population that was restless <b>about</b> <b>high</b> taxes and discontented with its leaders. Jihad fever swept northern Nigeria, with strong support among both the Fulani and the Hausa. Usman created an empire that included parts of northern Nigeria, Benin, and Cameroon, with Sokoto as its capital. He retired to teach and write and handed the empire to his son Muhammed Bello. The Sokoto Caliphate lasted until 1903 when the British conquered northern Nigeria.|$|E

25|$|Kennecott Copper Mines {{was formed}} in 1910 after a merger of Utah Copper and Kennecott copper mining companies. By 1912, {{environmental}} protection organizations were complaining <b>about</b> <b>high</b> levels of asbestos {{being used in the}} organization. Kennecott Corporation was using asbestos for preventing fires since copper processing requires very high temperatures. Copper has a very high boiling point and also requires use of other chemicals to separate it from other metals and impurities present in the ore. Asbestos has microscopic particles that dispersed into the atmosphere and contributed to illnesses among workers and individuals living near the mines. Asbestos is responsible for illnesses such as pleural fibrosis, skin warts and lung cancer.|$|E
25|$|A {{representative}} {{survey of}} consumers {{carried out in}} December 2007 showed that most consumers believe prices are too high. However, it also showed that they overestimate the price of water (Euro 4.80/m3 instead of the actual average price of Euro 3.02/m3). Interestingly, 55% of the French population believe that treated wastewater is directly being reused as drinking water, {{which is not the}} case. The survey also shows that 84% of French consumers trust that the quality of their tap water is good. 67% declare that they drink water from the tap at least once a week. Those who are dissatisfied about tap water quality complain mainly <b>about</b> <b>high</b> levels of chlorine and calcium carbonate.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the central {{ownership}} of the teams, all players are paid by the league. This is to ensure that no team receives an unfair advantage over any other with regards to financial success. The payscale has set a number of tiers which group players of similar experience levels, with all players in the same tier receiving the same pay. The ABL has considered the possibility of having one or two marquee players paid above the standard scale, though no final decision has been made with regard to this. One concern <b>about</b> <b>high</b> rates of pay expressed by the ABF was that it was a contributing factor, if not the main factor, in the failure of the previous Australian Baseball League. ABF management has also expressed the concern that if this league were to fail, there may never be another opportunity for professional baseball in Australia.|$|E

25|$|Signing Off is {{the debut}} album by British reggae band UB40, {{released}} in the UK on 29 August 1980 by Dudley-based independent label Graduate Records. It was an immediate success in their home country, reaching number 2 on the UK albums chart, and made UB40 {{one of the many}} popular reggae band in Britain, several years before the band found international fame. The politically-concerned lyrics struck a chord in a country with widespread public concerns <b>about</b> <b>high</b> unemployment, the policies of the recently elected Conservative party under Margaret Thatcher, {{and the rise of the}} racist National Front party, while the record's dub-influenced rhythms reflected the late 1970s influence in British pop music of West Indian music introduced by immigrants from the Caribbean after the Second World War, particularly reggae and ska – this was typified by the 2 Tone movement, at that point at the height of its success and led by fellow West Midlands act The Specials, with whom UB40 drew comparisons due to their multiracial band line-up and socialist views.|$|E
25|$|At {{about the}} same time, Washington sent William Woodford's 3rd Virginia Brigade and four cannons under du Plessis to block any British attempt to turn his right flank. Soon afterward, the American {{commander}} encountered Lieutenant Colonel David Rhea who told him <b>about</b> <b>high</b> ground on the south flank. Washington ordered Rhea to find Nathanael Greene and lead him to the position. Around 3:00 PM Greene reached on Comb's Hill to find it protected on three sides by a swampy stream and overlooking the British left flank. Du Plessis, adjutant to American artillery chief Henry Knox, arrived with four 6-pound cannons around 3:30 PM. Unlimbering their guns, his crews opened an enfilading fire against the British line at the hedgerow and their nearby artillery line. This probably caused Clinton to order a withdrawal soon after. Later, Anthony Wayne sallied forth to attack the British and Clinton sent the 1st Grenadiers and the 33rd Foot to push him back. As Wayne fell back, the British again came within range of du Plessis' guns around 5:30 PM. According to legend, one well-aimed cannonball passed along {{the front of a}} grenadier platoon, knocking the muskets out of every man's hands. The British attack faltered and their troops finally retired.|$|E
