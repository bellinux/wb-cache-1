He comes to Donna's comedy show, but she leaves with another man, Sam (David Cross). She has an awkward evening with Sam and quickly leaves. After her terrible night, Donna visits her mother to talk about her upcoming abortion. Her mother comforts her by telling her that she too had an abortion before Donna was conceived.|$|E
25|$|A {{reference}} that names {{an imaginary}} source {{is in some}} sense also a self-reference. A self-reference automatically makes <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> <b>about</b> itself.

25|$|It {{seemed that}} no one in the Channel Nine box could make <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> <b>about</b> him that wasn't negative. His feet, hands, {{technique}} and temperament were questioned. His second-innings 46 was not enough. And they weren't always wrong. It just seemed kind of mean. Especially when at the back of the press box some seemed happy when he was out. But it went deeper than McNamara's comments. Bailey had made mistakes in his career. He hadn't made enough first-class runs. He hadn't come into the team as a young man. He came into the captaincy without playing a game. He came into the Test team because of one-day runs. He was everything old-school cricket didn't like. A thinking cricketer who had never demanded inclusion, but who had been included regardless. For old-school types like Ian Chappell, he was pretty much everything he didn't like. And Chappell wasn't just turning on Bailey because of his stoush with Channel Nine. He had not liked Bailey for a long time.|$|E

[...] Barbara Barnett said that [...] "House is the needy one in the relationship, and Wilson the doormat" [...] Verne Gay of Newsday described House's love for Wilson as [...] "touching and genuine". However, Robert Sean Leonard compared the relationship between the two to that of Cesar Millan and his Pit Bull, while Hugh Laurie said that it's [...] "not just buddydom".

[...] The New York Times wrote, [...] "in further criticism of Mr. Kennedy, the Muslim leader cited the murders of Patrice Lumumba, Congo leader, of Medgar Evers, civil rights leader, and of the Negro girls bombed earlier this year in a Birmingham church. These, he said, were instances of other 'chickens coming home to roost'." [...] The remarks prompted a widespread public outcry. The Nation of Islam, which had sent a message of condolence to the Kennedy family and ordered its ministers not to comment on the assassination, publicly censured their former shining star. MalcolmX retained his post and rank as minister, but was prohibited from public speaking for 90 days.|$|E
500|$|The rumors {{concerning}} his sexuality {{led to a}} Gawker article linking him to a New York Post Page Six blind item about a closeted gay actor, nicknamed [...] "the Gay Rapist". Despite {{the victim of the}} alleged attack denying that it was Franco, two magazines then contacted Franco's lawyer to alert them that they might run stories suggesting his involvement, but were unable to, as at least part of their stories were fabricated. However, Gawker refused to take their article down as they were simply reporting what another outlet published and instead offered him a chance to make <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> <b>about</b> the speculation on its website. He declined, hoping it would die down. The actor later called the episode very offensive because he has friends who have been raped. In July 2015, a former Gawker employee admitted on his Twitter account — in now deleted posts — that he was pressured to write a series of articles about [...] "the Gay Rapist", and lead readers into believing the man was Franco.|$|E
