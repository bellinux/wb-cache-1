5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s an {{anthology}} titled Brief Fantastic Tales <b>appeared</b> <b>from</b> Studio Publications in Toronto; it consisted mostly of reprints from Uncanny Tales, {{and despite the}} difference {{in the name of the}} publisher it is likely it came from the same editor and publishers as Uncanny Tales.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} British reprint editions of Thrilling Wonder. The earlier edition, from Atlas Publishing, {{produced}} three numbered issues from 1949 to 1950, and a further seven from 1952 to 1953. Another four issues <b>appeared</b> <b>from</b> Pemberton between 1953 and 1954; these were numbered from 101 to 104. There were Canadian editions in 1945–1946 and 1948–1951.|$|E
5|$|Blyton capitalised {{upon her}} {{commercial}} success {{as an author}} by negotiating agreements with jigsaw puzzle and games manufacturers from the late 1940s onwards; by the early 1960s some 146 different companies were involved in merchandising Noddy alone. In 1948 Bestime released four jigsaw puzzles featuring her characters, and the first Enid Blyton board game appeared, Journey Through Fairyland, created by BGL. The first card game, Faraway Tree, <b>appeared</b> <b>from</b> Pepys in 1950. In 1954 Bestime released the first four jigsaw puzzles of the Secret Seven, and the following year a Secret Seven card game appeared.|$|E

5|$|Crucially, {{both the}} Wartburg rally in 1817 and the Hambach Festival in 1832 had lacked any {{clear-cut}} program of unification. At Hambach, {{the positions of}} the many speakers illustrated their disparate agendas. Held together only by the idea of unification, their notions of how to achieve this did not include specific plans but instead rested on the nebulous idea that the Volk (the people), if properly educated, would bring about unification on their own. Grand speeches, flags, exuberant students, and picnic lunches did not translate into a new political, bureaucratic, or administrative apparatus. While many spoke about the need for a constitution, no such document <b>appeared</b> <b>from</b> the discussions. In 1848, nationalists sought to remedy that problem.|$|E
5|$|Following {{service in}} the First World War, Wilson became known for singing tenor roles in oratorios by composers from Bach to Elgar, and was {{particularly}} admired both as the Evangelist in Bach's St Matthew Passion and {{in the title role}} of The Dream of Gerontius. He was a champion of music by English composers of his generation, notably Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst and Rutland Boughton. He also <b>appeared</b> <b>from</b> time to time in operatic tenor roles, including Satyavan in the first professional performance of Holst's Savitri. The quality of his voice and even his technique, though, was not universally admired. In a high-profile libel case Wilson sued a member of the public who had criticised one of his performances in a letter, and the BBC for publishing it: he won £2,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 1979, a bus {{carrying}} 18 American Navy sailors {{was forced}} to stop by a delivery truck. Shortly afterwards, four men <b>appeared</b> <b>from</b> within another vehicle and opened fire, killing Emil White and John Ball. Both the EPB and the OVPRR accepted responsibility for the attack, citing it as payback for the unclarified death of Ángel Rodríguez Cristóbal (previously arrested for protesting the Navy's activities in the island of Vieques) in a federal prison in Tallahassee, which had raised controversy because the photographic evidence displayed signs of contusions and contradicted the official account that he had simply committed suicide. On March 13, 1980, the EPB took responsibility for attacking an ROTC vehicle that was moving three soldiers to the UPR.|$|E

5|$|Philip's fleet {{had just}} {{escaped from the}} allied {{blockade}} and Philip ordered that a squadron head to Athens. The Macedonian squadron sailed into Piraeus and captured four Athenian ships. As the Macedonian squadron was retreating, the Rhodian and Pergamese fleet, which had followed Philip's ships across the Aegean, <b>appeared</b> <b>from</b> the allied base at Aegina and attacked the Macedonians. The allies defeated the Macedonian fleet and recaptured the Athenian ships, which {{they returned to the}} Athenians. The Athenians were so pleased by the rescue that they replaced the recently abolished pro-Macedonian tribes, the Demetrias and Antigonis tribes, with the Attalid tribe in honour of Attalus as well as destroying monuments that had previously been erected in honour of Macedonian Kings. Attalus and the Rhodians convinced the Athenian assembly to declare war on the Macedonians.|$|E
5|$|Several British {{editions of}} If were produced. In 1953 and 1954, Strato Publications reprinted 15 issues, {{numbering}} them from 1 to 15; another 18 were reprinted between 1959 and 1962, {{with the issue}} numbers started at 1 again. Between January and November 1967 a UK edition <b>appeared</b> <b>from</b> Gold Star Publications; these were identical to the US edition dated ten months previously. Between 1972 and 1974, 15 of the UPD editions of If were imported, renumbered and repriced for UK distribution. The numbering, inexplicably, ran from 1 to 9, and then 11, 1, 13, 3, 4 and 5.|$|E
5|$|The Enquiry into Plants (along {{with the}} Causes of Plants) was first {{translated}} into Latin by Theodore Gaza by 1454, circulated in manuscript, and then published at Treviso in 1483. In its original Greek it first <b>appeared</b> <b>from</b> {{the press of}} Aldus Manutius at Venice, 1495–98, from a single corrupt manuscript which has since been lost. Wimmer identified two manuscripts of first quality, the Codex Urbinas in the Vatican Library, which was not made known to Johann Gottlob Schneider, who with H. F. Link made the first modern critical edition, Leipzig 1818–1821, and the excerpts in the Codex Parisiensis in the Bibliothèque nationale de France.|$|E

5|$|The {{constellation}} of Perseus may {{be derived from}} the Babylonian Old Man (MUL.SHU.GI) constellation, then associated with East in the MUL.APINan astronomical compilation dating to around 1000 BCE. In Greek mythology, Perseus {{was the son of}} Danaë, who was sent by King Polydectes to bring the head of Medusa the Gorgonwhose visage caused all who gazed upon her to turn to stoneas a wedding gift. Perseus slew Medusa in her sleep, and Pegasus and Chrysaor <b>appeared</b> <b>from</b> her body. Perseus continued to the realm of Cepheus whose daughter Andromeda was to be sacrificed to Cetus the sea monster.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in 2013, a year after creatures known as the Twisted have <b>appeared</b> <b>from</b> beneath Manhattan and {{decimated}} the city. To fight back against the Twisted, an investigatory team called the Counter Twisted Investigation (CTI) is formed. Among their number is series protagonist Aya Brea, who was found unconscious and suffering amnesia {{two years before the}} game's events. Using her Overdive ability, Aya travels into the past to alter the outcome of battles against the Twisted. At the same time, Aya attempts to find out the origin of the Twisted and regain her memories.|$|E
5|$|The main {{cell in the}} {{thunderstorm}} system <b>appeared</b> <b>from</b> Bureau of Meteorology radar {{analysis to}} split into two separate and distinct cells. This development resulted {{in one part of}} the major storm to head north, to Maroochydore, while the other part headed south towards Brisbane. The southern cell struck Brisbane just after 1:00pm, with intense lightning activity and hailstones the size of marbles falling. The storm caused a lengthy delay during the First Test of the series between Australia and the West Indies, when hail forced play to be stopped at the Brisbane Cricket Ground around 1:15pm.|$|E
