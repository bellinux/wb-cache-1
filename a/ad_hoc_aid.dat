This paper looks at the particular circumstances of the island nations of the Southwest Pacific. In their context, dependence on outside help for counter‐disaster management is recognised, but {{in the light of the}} present economic, social, cultural and political characteristics of these countries, it is concluded that aid donors should shift the emphasis of their activities to the promotion of a greater self‐help approach in the individual countries, as against the provision of emergency material aid from outside. The extent to which this policy could be adopted depends on the local resource base. Rather than relying mainly on emergency <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>aid</b> delivery following each disaster, it is considered that donors would improve the disaster response through the previous provision of advice, training and funds. This would facilitate the growth and development of internal counter‐disaster organizatons, and assist countries to make their own decisions on the timing and nature of the aid required. Such a policy could also meet concerns that arise about external interference. Copyrigh...|$|E

In this paper, we {{introduce a new}} middleware framework for wireless <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks to <b>aid</b> the development of robust algorithms.

We demonstrate the utility of our framework by showing how {{it can be used to}} implement a simple fault-tolerant broadcast protocol, and discuss algorithms to implement each of the components. ...|$|R

Furthermore, we derive design goals for all protocols to be implemented in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks. We also provide an extensive overview of present and future <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network applications, used standards, and proposed solutions.
