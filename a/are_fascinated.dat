5|$|The Boggs' {{neighbors are}} curious about their new house guest, and the Boggs throw a {{neighborhood}} barbecue welcoming Edward. Most {{of the neighbors}} <b>are</b> <b>fascinated</b> by Edward and befriend him, except for the eccentric religious fanatic Esmeralda and Kim's boyfriend Jim. Edward repays the neighborhood for their kindness by trimming their hedges into topiaries. This leads him to discover he can groom dogs' hair, and later he styles the hair of the neighborhood women. One of the neighbors, Joyce, offers to help Edward open a hair salon. While scouting a location, Joyce attempts to seduce Edward, but scares him away. Joyce tells the neighborhood women that he attempted to seduce her, reducing their trust in him. The bank refuses to give Edward a loan as {{he does not have}} a background or financial history.|$|E
25|$|They are a {{hardy and}} useful {{aquarium}} fish despite having a coloration {{that is by}} no means striking or unusual. Many aquarists <b>are</b> <b>fascinated</b> by the habits of these fish. They ceaselessly comb the bottom of the aquarium for food and therefore disturb it slightly, sending up detritus and waste material that has settled loosely on the bottom. They prefer being kept in groups of 5 or more, being sociable fish and are ideal fish for a community tank. Other Corydoras species can be placed in the same aquarium, and despite the strong resemblance many species bear to one another, the species will tend to separate out and only move about among their own kind.|$|E
500|$|Ra'is el-Tahrir was {{intended}} {{to serve as a}} weekly review of the pan-Arab press, but in practice the program became a medium through which Qandil expressed his opinions on various issues confronting Egypt and the Arab world, views which he claimed were representative of the popular Egyptian sentiment. Al-Ahram Weekly′s Amina Elbandary wrote that during the show, Qandil spoke [...] "in histrionic style, his commentary replete with daring questions and remarks. Viewers <b>are</b> <b>fascinated</b> by his apparent lack of inhibition." ...|$|E

500|$|Though tiki bars {{in general}} {{declined}} in {{popularity in the}} late 1970s and 1980s until {{the revival of the}} style in the 1990s, the Sip 'n Dip survived with few changes. [...] During the 1990s, the idea of having mermaids swim in the pool during evening bar hours was the brainchild of the bar's general manager, Sandra Johnson-Thares and her mother, who wanted to add a [...] "fun factor." [...] It began with a single [...] "mermaid" [...] in the pool on New Year's Eve in 1995. [...] Today, [...] Johnson-Thares makes the mermaid costumes herself and said, [...] "I never in my life believed the mermaid attraction would be such a big hit. People <b>are</b> <b>fascinated</b> with them, and it's not something you'd expect to see in Montana." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{humor of}} the show comes from the [...] "disparity" [...] between the [...] "cute" [...] {{appearance}} of the characters and their [...] "crude" [...] behavior. However, Parker and Stone said in an early interview that the show's language is realistic. [...] "There are so many shows where little kids are good and sweet, and it's just not real... Don't people remember what they were like in third grade? We were little bastards." [...] Frederic Biddle of The Boston Globe notes how the show [...] "constantly plays on its grade-school aesthetic for shock value, with great success", arguing that at its height, it is [...] "more a profane 'Peanuts' than a downsized 'Beavis and Butt-Head.'" [...] He points, for example, to Kenny, who symbolically represents the voiceless underclass, which is eliminated in each episode. Claire Bickley of the Toronto Sun explains that [...] "The show captures that mix of innocence and viciousness that can co-exist in kids that age", that [...] "the boys <b>are</b> <b>fascinated</b> by bodily functions", and that they [...] "mimic adult behavior and language". For example, Kyle instructs Stan and Wendy to [...] "make sweet love down by the fire", a phrase he learns from Chef. In a light-hearted study of the humor of flatulence, Jim Dawson explains how the rise of adult animation in the 1990s allowed television to indulge in such humor with The Ren & Stimpy Show, The Simpsons, and Beavis and Butt-Head. Beginning with [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", South Park builds on this tradition.|$|E

In a world where people are increasingly disconnected from their families they rely more on their pets, specifically dogs, to fill emotional voids. [...] "People <b>are</b> <b>fascinated</b> by pets. They act and spend on {{them as if they}} were their own children." [...] Colin Jerolmack.|$|E

2500|$|This {{definition}} explicitly {{ignores the}} biological concept of race, still subject to scientific debate. In {{the words of}} David C. Rowe [...] "A racial concept, although sometimes {{in the guise of}} another name, will remain in use in biology and in other fields because scientists, as well as lay persons, <b>are</b> <b>fascinated</b> by human diversity, some of which is captured by race." ...|$|E

They aggregate {{in considerable}} numbers around {{objects such as}} drifting flotsam, rafts, jellyfish and floating seaweed. The objects appear to provide a [...] "visual stimulus in an optical void". Floating objects can offer some protection for juvenile fish from predators. An abundance of drifting seaweed or jellyfish can result in significant increases in the survival rates of some juvenile species.|$|E

Malley Co. in 1898, and {{enlarged}} in 1899 as a nine-story Beaux-Arts style building. [...] It continued to remodel and improve, adding New England's first self-leveling elevator in 1923, and escalators in 1958.

2500|$|Columbus {{has stated}} that {{he was drawn to}} {{directing}} the Percy Jackson movie because it gave him the [...] "opportunity to do a movie that we haven't really seen before for this generation. When I was a kid, there were movies that dealt with Greek mythology, which in terms of visual effects was really primitive. So I thought this was an opportunity to deal with Greek mythology which children and adults all over the world <b>are</b> <b>fascinated</b> by and it was not a new genre but a new avenue, dealing with mythological creatures in a contemporary setting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Doughty's {{intention}} {{with the}} book was to combine [...] "memoir, science, and manifesto" [...] in an entertaining way that would attract a wide readership to the unpleasant topics of death, decay, and corpse handling, in order to challenge the reader to confront their own mortality. Doughty says readers have told her that they themselves <b>are</b> <b>fascinated</b> by the graphic descriptions of such things as [...] "stomach-content removal" [...] or the [...] "bubblating" [...] of human fat during a cremation, yet they are [...] "not sure other {{people will be able}} to handle it."

In that interview he also mentioned a course he has twice given at Indiana University, in which he took a [...] "skeptical look at a number of highly-touted AI projects and overall approaches". For example, upon the defeat of Garry Kasparov by Deep Blue, he commented that [...] "It was a watershed event, but it doesn't have to do with computers becoming intelligent".|$|E
2500|$|Maurizio Meloni {{highlights}} {{the similarities between}} Girard, Jacques Lacan and Sigmund Freud. Meloni claims that these similarities arise because the projects undertaken by the three men—namely, to understand the role of mythology in structuring the human psyche and culture—were very similar. What is more, both Girard and Lacan read these myths {{through the lens of}} structural anthropology so {{it is not surprising that}} their intellectual systems came to resemble one another so strongly. Meloni writes that Girard and Lacan were [...] "moved by similar preoccupations and <b>are</b> <b>fascinated</b> by and attracted to the same kind of issues: the constituent character of the other in the structure of desire, the role of jealousy and rivalry in the construction of the social bond, the proliferation of triangles within apparently dual relations, doubles and mirrors, imitation and the Imaginary, and the crisis of modern society within which the [...] "rite of Oedipus" [...] is situated." ...|$|E

Consequently, the authorities <b>are</b> <b>fascinated</b> with the idea of the sliding scale or concertina army.

6000|$|To this criticism, which {{reflects}} a prevalent opinion, we {{may take some}} exceptions. For example, what De Quincey has to say of Style, though it were written in style-defying German, is of value to everyone who would teach that impossible subject. What he says or implies in [...] "Levana" [...] (the goddess who performed [...] "the earliest office of ennobling kindness" [...] for a newborn child, lifting him from the ground, where he was first laid, and presenting his forehead to the stars of heaven) has potency to awaken two of the great faculties of humanity, the power to think {{and the power to}} imagine. Again, many people <b>are</b> <b>fascinated</b> by dreams, those mysterious fantasies which carry us away on swift wings to meet strange experiences; and what De Quincey has to say of dreams, though doubtful as a dream itself, has never been rivaled. To a few mature minds, therefore, De Quincey is interesting entirely apart from his dazzling style and inimitable rhetoric.|$|E
