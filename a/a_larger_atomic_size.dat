40|$|We {{have studied}} the origin of a counter {{intuitive}} diffusion behavior of Fe and N atoms in a iron mononitride (FeN) thin film. It was observed that in-spite of <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>size,</b> Fe tend to diffuse more rapidly than smaller N atoms. This only happens in the N-rich region of Fe-N phase diagram, in the N-poor regions, N diffusion coefficient is orders of magnitude larger than Fe. Detailed self-diffusion measurements performed in FeN thin films reveal that the diffusion mechanism of Fe and N is different - Fe atoms diffuse through a complex process, which {{in addition to a}} volume diffusion, pre-dominantly controlled by a fast grain boundary diffusion. On the other hand N atoms diffuse through a classical volume-type diffusion process. Observed results have been explained in terms of stronger Fe-N (than Fe-Fe) bonds generally predicted theoretically for mononitride compositions of transition metals.

40|$|AbstractGlass {{formation}} is generally favored by <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> mismatch among constituent elements, which usually leads to large density {{differences among them}} as well. During melting, elemental segregation occurs due to Stokes’ law and then inevitably affects glass formation. In this paper, such effects on glass-forming ability in a TiCu-based alloy system have been demonstrated. In the bulk glass-forming composition Ti 43 Cu 42 Hf 14 Si 1, macroscopic segregation of Si was observed in the as-melted ingots and silicon was completely depleted in the as-cast rods. In another Ti 33 Cu 47 Ni 8 Zr 11 Si 1 alloy, nevertheless, the effects of density differences among the constituent elements were less severe. It was also confirmed that using proper pre-alloys could be an effective way in alleviating {{the side effects of}} the elemental segregation...|$|R

40|$|The {{geometrical}} {{properties of}} the icosahedral ordered structure formed in liquid and glassy phases of metallic glasses are investigated by using molecular dynamics simulations. We investigate the Zr-Cu alloy system {{as well as a}} simple model for binary alloys, in which we can change the <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> ratio between alloying components. In both cases, we found the same nature of icosahedral order in liquid and glassy phases. The icosahedral clusters are observed in liquid phases as well as in glassy phases. As the temperature approaches to the glass transition point Tg, the density of the clusters rapidly grows and the icosahedral clusters begin to connect to each other and form a medium-range network structure. By investigating the geometry of connection between clusters in the icosahedral network, we found that the dominant connecting pattern is the one sharing seven atoms which forms a pentagonal bicap with five-fold symmetry. From a geometrical point of view, we can understand the mechanism of the formation and growth of the icosahedral order by using the Regge calculus, which is originally employed to formulate a theory of gravity. The Regge calculus tells us that the distortion energy of the pentagonal bicap could be decreased by introducing an <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> difference between alloying elements and that the icosahedral network would be stabilized by <b>a</b> considerably <b>large</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> difference...|$|R

40|$|A {{reliable}} {{prediction of}} interatomic force constants in disordered alloys {{is an outstanding}} problem. This {{is due to the}} need for a proper treatment of multisite (at least pair) correlation within a random environment. The situation becomes even more challenging for systems with <b>a</b> <b>large</b> difference in <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> and mass. We propose a systematic density functional theory (DFT) based study to predict the ab initio force constants in random alloys. The method is based on a combination of special quasirandom structures and the augmented space recursion to calculate phonon spectra, density of states (DOS), etc. The bcc TaW and fcc NiPt alloys are considered as the two distinct test cases. The Ta-Ta (W-W) bond distance in the alloy is predicted to be smaller (larger) than those in pure Ta (W), which, in turn, yields stiffer (softer) force constants for Ta (W). Pt-Pt force constants in the alloy, however, are predicted to be softer compared to Ni-Ni, due to the large bond distance of the former. Our calculated force constants, phonon spectra, and DOS are compared with experiments and other theoretical results, wherever available. A correct trend of the present results for the two alloys paves a path for future studies in more complex alloy systems...|$|R

However, this difficulty may be overcome {{to some extent}} for nanocrystalline materials due to its weakened structure with <b>large</b> <b>a</b> surface-to-volume ratio. As a typical example, carbon nanotubes have been doped with silicon, sulfur [1], etc. Diamond is a super-functional material with many promising properties, which has been utilized in many commercial applications such as electrochemical electrodes, heterojunction, photodiode, radiation detectors, and high-frequency SAW devices [2 – 5]. Diamond films have high electrical resistivity when undoped and could be effectively p-type doped by boron [6, 7]. However, the realization of n-type doping of diamond films, based on device application, has met a serious obstacle of tough impurity doping problem [8]. The ideal n-type diamond films for electronic applications are hard to be acquired in experiments with the doping of Li, Na, N, P, S, As, Sb, etc [9 – 12]. Finding a well-established substitutional donor for n-type diamond films is a worldwide issue, owing to the extremely small lattice space between C-C atoms within the diamond structure. Previous studies on most impurity elements which have been reported are in the main group, and the subgroup element is rarely seen in papers because of its complicated atom structure with <b>larger</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>sizes</b> and its acquisition difficulty.|$|R

As such, investigation of spin state changes in Fe-bearing MgGeO$_ 3 $ might help to clarify some aspects of this type of state change in Fe-bearing MgSiO$_ 3 $. Using DFT+U calculations, we have investigated pressure induced spin state changes in Fe$^{ 2 +}$ and Fe$^{ 3 +}$ in MgGeO$_ 3 $ perovskite and post-perovskite. Owing to the relatively <b>larger</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> of germanium compared to silicon, germanate phases have larger unit cell volume and inter-atomic distances than equivalent silicate phases at same pressures.

We showed that iron state transitions occur at particular average Fe-O bond-length irrespective of mineral composition (silicate or germanate) or functionals (LDA+U$_{sc}$ or GGA+U$_{sc}$).
