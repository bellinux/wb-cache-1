5|$|Scuba diving {{fatalities}} have a {{major financial}} impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs. Equipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba, and when {{the cause of death}} is recorded as drowning, it is usually the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events in which drowning is the endpoint because it occurred in water, while the initial cause remains unknown. <b>Air</b> <b>embolism</b> is also frequently cited as a cause of death, often as a consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent, occasionally aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research which could improve diver safety.|$|E

5|$|Methods of euthanizing {{laboratory}} {{animals are}} chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal {{can be made}} to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. Maceration (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing <b>air</b> <b>embolism</b> are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.|$|E

Diving becomes more dangerous as depth increases, and deep diving presents many hazards. All surface-breathing animals are subject to decompression sickness, including aquatic mammals and free-diving humans (see taravana).

40|$|A {{hitherto}} unappreciated correlation {{exists between}} nature of vessel grouping {{and nature of}} imperforate tracheary elements in wood of dicotyledons at large: families and genera with true tracheids (large fully bordered pits common on both radial and tangential walls) have solitary vessels. Presence of true tracheids as a subsidiary conductive system is hypothesized to render vessel grouping a superfluous adaptation. Vessel grouping does occur to various degrees in taxa with fiber-tracheids or libriform fibers; the degree of grouping is related to likelihood or seriousness of vessel failure by <b>air</b> <b>embolisms</b> because of either drought or frost. Grouping of vessels {{is regarded as a}} way of providing alternate conduits whereby water can be carried in the same pathways in case one or several vessels in a group are incapacitated by <b>air</b> <b>embolisms.</b> Presence of vascular tracheids, if sufficiently abundant, is held to be correlated with smaller degree of vessel grouping because vascular tracheids can form a subsidiary conductive system; small numbers of vascular tracheids do not affect vessel grouping patterns. Species which possess vasicentric tracheids possess a subsidiary conductive system ideally located around vessels and have solitary vessels or else (ifvasicentric tracheids are less common) a low degree of vessel grouping. Species with very large vessels at the beginning of growth rings tend to have little grouping in the earlywood vessels but more grouping in latewood vessels; this dimorphism is held to relate to enhanced safety oflatewood vessels, since earlywood vessels have little safety and the latewood is thereby the wood portion where safety mechanisms are concentrated. Fiber-tracheids do not have sufficient conductive capabilities to form a subsidiary conductive system; borders on pits of fiber-tracheids are rapidly lost during evolution, and such loss generally pr~cedes appearance of septate or nucleated conditions or is simultaneous with it. Relative selective value of the various vessel grouping types (clusters, radial multiples, diagonal bands, tangential bands) as well as of larger aggregations remains a topic for more investigation, as does significance of grouping of primary xylem vessels...|$|R

Nevertheless, there was significant {{flow in the}} older rings of the xylem. Total water flow through the trunk was only slightly reduced when <b>air</b> <b>embolisms</b> were artificially induced in early-wood vessels, probably because there was little change in hydraulic conductance in the root-leaf sap pathway.

With this potential new change in policy it becomes increasingly more important for health care institutions to monitor (track) medical errors and determine what measures can be taken proactively {{to prevent the occurrence}} of errors.

Questions arise when considering theses changes: what is a medical error? Why is it important to track medical errors, and how can health care providers increase medical error reporting?

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{presented}} {{that enables the}} induction of embolisms in a fraction of all xylem vessels, based on diameter, at one cut end of a stem segment. The method {{is based on the}} different capillary characteristic of xylem vessels of different cross-sectional size. To verify the method, <b>air</b> <b>embolisms</b> were induced in cut xylem vessels of chrysanthemum (Dendranthemaxgrandiflorum Tzvelev cv. Cassa) stem segments at different xylem tensions and compared with the distribution of gas-filled vessels as visualized by cryo-scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM). At - 6 kPa xylem pressure, air-entrance was only induced in large diameter vessels (> 30 ?m), while at - 24 kPa embolisms were induced in almost all xylem vessels (> 10 ?m). Although the principle of the embolization method worked well, smaller diameter vessels were observed to be embolized than was expected according to the calculations. The role of cross-sectional shape and contact angle between xylem sap and vessel wall at the menisci are discussed. After correction for the observed (diameter independent) deviation from circularity of the cross-sectional vessel shape the contact angle was calculated to be approximately 55 °. Hydraulic resistance (Rh) measurements before and after embolization showed that the effect of embolizing only large diameter cut xylem vessels had only a small influence on overall Rh of a stem segment. Embolizing all cut xylem vessels at one cut end almost trebled overall Rh. The difference was discussed {{in the light of the}} networking capacity of the xylem syste...|$|R

The patient had immediate severe consequences of this intravenous infusion of a feeding. Over the following 30 plus years there have been numerous case reports of accidental connections of feeding lines to intravenous lines, intravenous lines and feeding lines to tracheostomy cuffs, blood pressure monitors to intravenous lines and other life threatening connections of compatible tubing to the wrong line (Lanigan 2002; FDA 2003; Eakle, Gallauresi et al. 2005). To date there has been no progress in eradicating this avoidable error. The common element in each of these tragic errors is the presence of a “luer lock ” connector that Debora Simmons, MSN, RN makes connecting therapeutic products easy but also allows fatal errors when they are mistakenly connected. Blood pressure cuffs to intravenous lines can cause <b>air</b> <b>embolisms,</b> feeding tubes to intravenous lines cause sepsis and fat embolisms and intrathecal infusions of vincristine are fatal. The commonality is that each one of these errors involves a luer lock connector (FDA 2003). Initial reactions to these case reports may be to question the vigilance of the nurse. How could a careful nurse accidentally connect the wrong lines? The answer is complex and includes many different factors that contribute to making this type of error. ...|$|R

Xylem hydraulic conductance as well as recovery from <b>air</b> <b>embolisms</b> {{at the start of}} vase life strongly depends on number, diameter and length of xylem vessels in the base of the cut flower stems. In this research we employed different water availability levels (high and low water content) in the growing medium of Zinnia elegans plants of three cultivars ('Envy', 'Purple Prince' and 'Scarlet Flame') to modify xylem anatomy and post-harvest xylem functioning and vase life of cut flowers from these plants. Vase-life was longer among fresh-cut Zinnia flowers in all three cultivars grown under low water content in the root medium. Zinnia flowers of all cultivars grown at high water content were not able to sufficiently restore water uptake at the start of their vase life. Shoot hydraulic conductivity was lower in water-stressed plants but it was not different among the three Zinnia cultivars within the same treatment. Anatomical analysis showed smaller xylem vessel diameters but no differences in xylem number and length, with the exception that in cultivar Purple Prince vessels were longer in well-watered plants. We conclude from these results that within these three Zinnia elegans cultivars water stress conditions in the root environment significantly affected xylem anatomy and functioning which correlates well with a longer vase life.
