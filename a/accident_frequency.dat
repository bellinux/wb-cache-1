Construction began in May1988, and the project was expected to be completed on October31, 1991. It was proceeding on schedule until the village of Westbury filed a suit against NYSDOT in February1989. The lawsuit claimed that NYSDOT did not follow proper environmental guidelines while designing the project because their environmental impact report failed to consider the impacts of a nearby future widening project on the Northern State Parkway. This widening project, considered a second phase of the interchange reconstruction, had no intended date of construction.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, two-state Markov {{switching}} {{models are}} proposed to study <b>accident</b> <b>frequencies.</b> These models {{assume that there}} are two unobserved states of roadway safety, and that roadway entities (roadway segments) can switch between these states over time. The states are distinct, in the sense that in the different states <b>accident</b> <b>frequencies</b> are generated by separate counting processes (by separate Poisson or negative binomial processes). To demonstrate the applicability of the approach presented herein, two-state Markov switching negative binomial models are estimated using five-year <b>accident</b> <b>frequencies</b> on Indiana interstate highway segments. Bayesian inference methods and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations are used for model estimation. The estimated Markov switching models result in a superior statistical fit relative to the standard (single-state) negative binomial model. It is found that the more frequent state is safer and it is correlated with better weather conditions. The less frequent state is found to be less safe and to be correlated with adverse weather conditions.

50|$|On an {{empirical}} level, cost comparisons across jurisdictions are difficult for several reasons. First, different jurisdictions use different insurance models.

Second, mandated minimum levels of coverage and benefits can vary widely, even between provinces that use similar insurance models. Third, what is covered within a given category, such as medical benefits, may also differ between jurisdictions. Fourth, {{different parts of the}} country differ in areas such as demographics and weather, which may affect the costs of claims as well as <b>accident</b> <b>frequency.</b> Lastly, comparisons with other countries - and the United States in particular - are difficult since Canada’s public healthcare system covers medical costs that would otherwise often be borne by auto insurers.|$|E

This widening project, considered a second phase of the interchange reconstruction, had no intended date of construction.The Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court ruled that NYSDOT had to provide a new environmental report by May 12, 1989 or face having the reconstruction shut down. The order by the court reversed a decision by the New York State Supreme Court that determined that a revised report was unnecessary. Residents of Westbury claimed that the project would bring noise concerns to the village, along with a spillover of diverted traffic to local roads. Concerns were also stated by then-mayor Ernest Strada about Westbury's water supply and potential impacts from the project. NYSDOT claimed that no disruption would be caused by the project, but Strada insisted there were still concerns. Strada also stated that the village had no interest in shutting down the project; rather, they wanted to ensure that their community would be protected from any disruptions caused by the reconstruction. On April 24, NYSDOT announced they had appealed the stoppage of work on the interchange, which had been suspended pending a ruling by the Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state.|$|E

In this sense, for example, Italian Regulations based on the EU Directive 2008 / 98 /EC suggest the Safety Potential (SAPO), an economical performance indicator relying on accident rates and average accident social costs, while predictive methods are not explicitly provided. Anyway, independently from the reasons why a road site was selected for safety-based interventions after the screening, the designers of the interventions are interested in knowing its actual safety level. This information can be crucial in order to: 1) know the potential for safety improvements, 2) ponder the type of interventions, 3) make comparisons with similar sites.|$|R
