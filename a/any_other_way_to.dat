25|$|Home sign arises due to {{the absence}} of <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> communicate. Within the span of a single {{lifetime}} and without the support or feedback of a community, the child naturally invents signs to help meet his or her communication needs, and may even develop a few grammatical rules for combining short sequences of signs. Still, this kind of system is inadequate for the intellectual development of a child and it comes nowhere near meeting the standards linguists use to describe a complete language. No type of home sign is recognized as a full language.|$|E
25|$|I think I thought I {{could handle}} things. Didn't {{know how to}} shoot music. Music had been {{important}} in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough stuff to shoot. I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn't seem {{to work it out}} without just putting up multiple cameras and shooting an awful lot of film... I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't think there was <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> do it given the circumstances.|$|E

We're going to create [...] by combining kerosene and diesel and compressed air, pushing it at very high pressure, about 16 bar, down a pipe." [...] The question of the effectiveness of the destruction – even the possibility that some of the partially combusted ivory may find its way back to the black market – is a touchy subject.

500|$|The Fringe {{division}} {{visits a}} secured Massive Dynamic facility where the prime universe's {{version of the}} doomsday device, believed to be an artifact of the [...] "First People", has been assembled. The company is {{trying to use the}} books about the First People, including those that William Bell had sought, that they have collected to understand the workings of the device. They are aware that before her departure, Fauxlivia (Anna Torv)—Olivia's parallel universe doppelgänger—stole one component of the unit, possibly its power source as they cannot find <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> engage the device. However, as Peter (Joshua Jackson) nears it, the device reacts, moving into a new configuration and sending out electromagnetic pulses, while Peter suddenly has a nosebleed. Peter returns with Olivia (Torv) and Walter (John Noble) to Massive Dynamic to undergo some tests {{to see if he was}} the cause for the device's activation. Meanwhile, Broyles (Lance Reddick) asks Astrid (Jasika Nicole) to discreetly review the files pulled from Fauxlivia's computer for any hidden messages, not wishing to have Olivia or Peter be forced to learn of what Fauxlivia wrote about them.|$|E

500|$|During this period, Pierce {{worked as}} set {{decorator}} on films The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Cheap Detective (1978). The year after The Town That Dreaded Sundown, Piece directed and co-wrote Grayeagle, a Western {{based on a}} Cheyenne legend of a white man whose child (with an Indian wife) is kidnapped by a young warrior named Grayeagle. Pierce appeared in the film as Bugler, a half-insane white man who takes on a Shoshone identity. He then wrote and directed The Norseman (1978), which starred Lee Majors as a Viking prince who traveled to America to rescue his father from Indians. Working with a multimillion-dollar budget, Pierce shot the film in the Florida locations Hillsborough River State Park and New Port Richey. The next year he co-wrote and directed The Evictors (1979), another documentary-style horror film about a young couple who move into a rural Louisiana farmhouse and find their lives endangered {{by a series of}} strange events. Pierce was inspired to write the script after reading a true story in a detective magazine about a Kansas family who murdered somebody trying to evict them from the property. In order to match the late-evening sunlight in his cinematography at the farmhouse set, Pierce set up reflectors outside and deflected the sunlight through the windows, which were fitted with sheer white curtains to give the actors an eerie glow. The Evictors was little-seen and did not do financially well, which was a disappointment to distributor American International Pictures, but Pierce believed it one of his better films. He also considered it his most downbeat film, and said of the unhappy ending, [...] "I probably just didn't have <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> end it." ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{reviewed}} “the Foundation degree” and {{the case}} study, which was introduced by UK government in 2001 {{as a kind of}} new vocational degree, and tried to compare England with Japan in the short-term higher education institutions. Foundation degree is the equivalent of {{the first two years of}} an Honours degree, and the course programs are designed by the employers, further education institutions and higher education institutions. And HEs validate it as the degree. In England, they see Foundation degree as one of the ways of widening-participations into HEs and making the vocational education up to the academic degree. We Japanese can learn a lot about the curriculum designing from this new degree. However, to make vocational education “up” to meet with the academic degree may indicate the subordination of the vocational education. Are there <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> take? This is also the matter of how to accredit, improve and legitimate the educational contents in every more vocationalized major in Japanese unversities and junior colleges...|$|R
