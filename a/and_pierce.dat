5|$|An Arkansas {{resident}} {{most of his}} life, Pierce {{made his}} directorial debut with Boggy Creek, a faux documentary-style film inspired by {{the legend of the}} Bigfoot-like Fouke Monster. The low-budget film grossed roughly $25 million, <b>and</b> <b>Pierce</b> followed that success with several inexpensive, regional films set in the southern United States, including The Town That Dreaded Sundown, based on the true story of the Phantom Killer murders in Texarkana.|$|E

40|$|Tattoos <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> {{are part}} of the mankind since time began. It {{is by no means a}} matter of new fashion. Until recently, tattoos <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> was {{attributed}} to a fringe group of the population. Today, this body art is influenced by the fashion industry and music. However, during the application of tattoos <b>and</b> <b>piercing,</b> infection or blood-borne diseases can be transmitted. It is an activity in which the integrity of human skin is damaged. Therefore, in my diploma paper I deal with the issue of informedness about the risks of infection at tattoo <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> parlours. The main objective was to find out about the level of informedness of students at the Faculty of Health and Social Studies of the University of South Bohemia (ZSF JU) about the presence of infection and the possible risk of its transmission at tattoo <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> parlours. A secondary objective was to compare the level of knowledge of people with tattoos or body <b>piercing</b> <b>and</b> those without them. In this paper, the experience of ZSF JU students with tattoo <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> parlours <b>and</b> the knowledge about blood-borne diseases were described. This diploma paper used a quantitative research, through the form of an anonymous questionnaire. The group of respondents consisted of students at ZSF JU. The paper presented three hypotheses and the research results bring the following evident conclusions: H 1 : The population is not sufficiently informed about the risk of infection at tattoo <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> parlours. This hypothesis was refuted. H 2 : The informedness of the risk of infection at tattoo <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> parlours is higher for people with tattoos or body piercing than for people without them. It was found out that the informedness of the risk of infection in both groups did not differ statistically. H 3 : People, when choosing a tattoo or piercing parlour, are rather interested in the price than in the quality. This hypothesis was not confirmed. The knowledge obtained can serve as an informative material for the prevention of infection at tattoo <b>and</b> <b>piercing</b> parlours...|$|R

5|$|Pierce {{actively}} campaigned in {{his district}} on behalf of Jackson, who carried both the district and the nation by large margins in the November 1828 election, even though he lost New Hampshire. The outcome further strengthened the Democratic Party, <b>and</b> <b>Pierce</b> won his first legislative seat the following year, representing Hillsborough in the New Hampshire House of Representatives. Pierce's father, meanwhile, was elected again as governor, retiring after that term. The younger Pierce was appointed {{as chairman of the}} House Education Committee in 1829 and the Committee on Towns the following year. By 1831 the Democrats held a legislative majority, <b>and</b> <b>Pierce</b> was elected Speaker of the House. The young Speaker used his platform to oppose the expansion of banking, protect the state militia, and offer support to the national Democrats and Jackson's re-election effort. At the age of 27, he was a star of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. Though attaining early political and professional success, in his personal letters he continued to lament his bachelorhood and yearned for a life beyond Hillsborough.|$|E

To the President's surprise, the British did not expel Buchanan in retaliation. In his December 1855 message to Congress Pierce had set forth the American case that Britain had violated the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty. The British, according to Buchanan, were impressed by the message and were rethinking their policy. Nevertheless, Buchanan was not successful in getting the British to renounce their Central American possessions. The Canadian treaty was ratified by Congress, the British Parliament, and by the colonial legislatures in Canada.|$|E

Examples of this are Roger Moore, who was a special guest at the very first ceremony in 1985, and Diana Ross in 1987, then married to Norwegian entrepreneur Arne NÃ¦ss, Jr. Other international names appearing in the show as presenters have included Ned Beatty, Lauren Bacall, Jon Voight, Brian Cox, Jeremy Irons, Ben Kingsley <b>and</b> <b>Pierce</b> Brosnan.|$|E
5|$|Active {{military}} service was a long-held dream for Pierce, who had admired his father's and brothers' service in his youth, particularly {{his older brother}} Benjamin's, {{as well as that}} of John McNeil Jr., husband of Pierce's older half-sister Elizabeth. As a legislator, he was a passionate advocate for volunteer militias. As a militia officer himself, he had experience mustering and drilling bodies of troops. When Congress declared war against Mexico in May 1846, Pierce immediately volunteered to join, although no New England regiment yet existed. His hope to fight in the Mexican-American War was one reason he refused an offer to become Polk's Attorney General. General Zachary Taylor's advance slowed in northern Mexico, and General Winfield Scott proposed capturing the port of Vera Cruz and driving overland to Mexico City. Congress passed a bill authorizing the creation of ten regiments, <b>and</b> <b>Pierce</b> was appointed colonel and commander of the 9th Infantry Regiment in February 1847, with Truman B. Ransom as lieutenant colonel and second-in-command.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} rodents is their pairs of continuously growing, razor-sharp incisors. These incisors have thick layers of enamel {{on the front and}} little enamel on the back. Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue to wear them down so that they do not reach <b>and</b> <b>pierce</b> the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of a chisel. Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars. A gap, or diastema, occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to suck in their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood shavings and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the sides of their mouths. Chinchillas and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors.|$|E

5|$|An ally of Illinois' Stephen A. Douglas, Breckinridge {{supported}} {{the doctrine of}} popular sovereignty as expressed in Douglas's KansasâNebraska Act. He believed passage of the act would remove the issue of slavery from national politics â although it ultimately had the opposite effect â and acted as a liaison between Douglas <b>and</b> <b>Pierce</b> to secure its passage. During {{the debate on the}} House floor, New York's Francis B. Cutting, incensed by a statement that Breckinridge had made, demanded that he explain or retract it. Breckinridge interpreted Cutting's demand as a challenge to duel. Under code duello, the individual being challenged retained the right to name the weapons used and the distance between the combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 paces. He also specified that the duel should be held at Silver Spring, Maryland, the home of his friend Francis Preston Blair. Cutting, who had not intended his initial remark as a challenge, believed that Breckinridge's naming of terms constituted a challenge; he chose to use pistols at a distance of 10 paces. While the two men attempted to clarify who had issued the challenge and who reserved the right to choose the terms, mutual friends resolved the issue, preventing the duel. The recently adopted Kentucky Constitution prevented anyone who participated in a duel from holding elected office, and the peaceful resolution of the issue may have saved Breckinridge's political career.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of The Legend of Boggy Creek, Pierce was {{encouraged}} to film a sequel, but resisted {{because he wanted to}} prove himself as a filmmaker rather than duplicate the same idea. He continued to make inexpensive regional films set in the southern United States, primarily targeting small-town and rural audiences. His family said Pierce liked to be continuously working and would start a new film immediately after finishing the last. His sophomore effort was Bootleggers (1974), a period action-comedy film about rival families making moonshine in the Ozark Mountains. It featured Slim Pickens and the first major performance of Jaclyn Smith, who went on to play Kelly Garrett in the television series Charlie's Angels. Pierce followed that film up with two Westerns released in 1976. The first, Winterhawk, was about violence erupting between Blackfoot Native Americans and white villagers. The film proved difficult for Pierce to shoot due to challenges from the weather and problems with the horses on the set. However, according to Pierce, Winterhawk was more widely seen than The Legend of Boggy Creek. His second Western was Winds of Autumn. Pierce co-wrote both films with his Boggy Creek partner, Earl E. Smith. Pierce made a trademark of casting his friends in his films, <b>and</b> <b>Pierce</b> himself performed minor roles in both Winterhawk and Winds of Autumn. During this period, Pierce continued working as a set decorator for films such as Black Belt Jones (1974).|$|E

25|$|It {{was at this}} {{juncture}} that Kember <b>and</b> <b>Pierce</b> chose {{to enter into a}} contractual relationship with Gerald Palmer, a Northamptonshire businessman and concert promoter who had already been functioning recently as Spacemen 3's de facto manager. This tripartite business partnership had the following terms: Palmer would own the master tapes of all future recordings, the rights of which would be licensed to record labels for release; touring and recording costs etc. would be financed by Palmer, who would give Kember <b>and</b> <b>Pierce</b> an advance of Â£1,000 each; and, in return, all profits would be split 50:50: 50% for Palmer, and 50% for Kember <b>and</b> <b>Pierce</b> and other band members. Significantly, this contract was only with Kember <b>and</b> <b>Pierce,</b> meaning Spacemen 3 as a legal and financial entity would, in essence, constitute only {{the two of them together}} with Palmer.
