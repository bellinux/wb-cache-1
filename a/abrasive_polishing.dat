Unfortunately, little is understood about how to polish a micro bore and how to assess its inner wall quality because {{it is difficult to}} access the micro bore for either polishing or measurement. This article reports on a feasibility study of the <b>abrasive</b> flow <b>polishing</b> of micro bores of 260 similar to 500 -mum diameters and 25 similar to 50 length/diameter ratios for both metal and ceramic materials. An <b>abrasive</b> flow <b>polishing</b> machine was designed and built with turbulent flow characteristics. Polishing of steel S 45 C bores of 400 - and 500 -mum diameters, stainless steel 304 bores of 500 -mum diameter, and zirconia bores of 260 -mum diameter was conducted. Surface roughness and topography of the polished inner walls of micro bores were characterized using profilometry and optical interferometry from the three-dimensional point of view. Significant reduction in surface roughness of the micro bore inner walls has been made in the polishing processes. The results indicate that it is feasible to apply the <b>abrasive</b> flow <b>polishing</b> technology for metal and ceramic micro bores of diameters of 260 mum or larger and the length/diameter ratios of 25 or higher.

50|$|Very recently, {{advances}} in pattern application and deposition at reduced length scales have exploited small-scale synthesis methods including nano-scale chemical surface restructuring and photolithography of computer-generated random specular patterns to produce suitable surface contrast for DIC. The application of very fine powder particles that electrostatically {{adhere to the}} surface of the specimen and can be digitally tracked is one approach. For Al thin films, fine alumina <b>abrasive</b> <b>polishing</b> powder was initially used since the particle sizes are relatively well controlled, although the adhesion to Al films was not very good and the particles tended to agglomerate excessively. The candidate that worked most effectively was a silica powder designed for a high temperature adhesive compound (Aremco, inc.), which was applied through a plastic syringe. A light blanket of powder would coat the gage section of the tensile sample and the larger particles could be blown away gently. The remaining particles would be those with the best adhesion to the surface. While the resulting surface contrast is not ideal for DIC, the high intensity ratio between the particles and the background provide a unique opportunity to track the particles between consecutive digital images taken during deformation. This can be achieved quite straightforwardly using digital image processing techniques. Subpixel tracking can be achieved by a number of correlation techniques, or by fitting to the known intensity profiles of particles. Photolithography and Electron Beam Lithography can be used to create micro tooling for micro speckle stamps, and the stamps can print speckle patterns on{{to the surface of}} the specimen. Stamp inks can be chosen which are appropriate for optical DIC, SEM-DIC, and simultaneous SEM-DIC/EBSD studies (the ink can be transparent to EBSD).|$|E
40|$|The {{obtained}} analytical dependences {{for determining}} the basic parameters of the surface roughness during <b>abrasive</b> <b>polishing</b> are presented with modeling the cutting grains {{in the form of}} a sphere and considering the ordered arrangement of grains. It is shown that with a decrease in the thickness of the cut, the ratio of the altitude parameters of the surface roughness max Ra R / increases, reaching values of 20 [...] . 30 and more. This is consistent with the experimental data obtained by <b>abrasive</b> <b>polishing.</b> Consequently, the modeling of abrasive grains {{in the form of a}} sphere is more in line with the actual conditions for the formation of surface roughness in both <b>abrasive</b> <b>polishing</b> and grinding. Calculations established that the process of <b>abrasive</b> <b>polishing</b> proceeds under conditions corresponding to the transition from the cutting process to the process of friction of the grain with the material being processed. It is also shown that with the reduction of the ratio max Ra R / to 4 [...] . 6 (corresponding to the grinding conditions), the process of metal removal and the formation of surface roughness occurs in a stable cutting process. This establishes a close relationship of the relationship max Ra R / with the ratio of the thickness of the cut and the radius of rounding of the cutting edge of the abrasive grain. It has been experimentally established that when the ball is smoothed out, the ratio max Ra R / = 14. 2, and Ra = 0. 1 mkm. At fine turning with a diamond tool max Ra R / = 21. 2, and Ra = 0. 1 micron. When <b>abrasive</b> <b>polishing</b> max Ra R / = 30, and Ra = 0. 1 micron. The obtained results of theoretical and experimental studies indicate the possibility of a significant decrease in the surface roughness in <b>abrasive</b> <b>polishing,</b> which opens up new technological possibilities for its practical use. ...|$|E

In this paper, three-dimensional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to investigate the effect of impacting direction on abrasive cutting process during <b>abrasive</b> flow <b>polishing.</b> The molecular dynamics simulation software Lammps was used to simulate the cutting of single crystal copper with SiC abrasive grains at different cutting angles (0 o– 45 o). At a constant friction coefficient, we found a direct relation between cutting angle and cutting force, which ultimately increases the number of dislocation during abrasive flow machining. Our theoretical study reveal that a small cutting angle is beneficial for improving surface quality and reducing internal defects in the workpiece. However, there is no obvious relationship between cutting angle and friction coefficient.|$|R

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{surfaces}} having micro and nano-scale features {{can be used to}} control cell behaviours including; cell proliferation, migration and adhesion. The aim of this work was to compare the use of laser processing and <b>abrasive</b> <b>polishing</b> to develop micro/nano-patterned polyurethane substrates for controlling fibroblast cell adhesion, migration and proliferation. Laser processing in a directional manner resulted in polyurethane surfaces having a ploughed field effect with micron-scale features. In contrast, <b>abrasive</b> <b>polishing</b> in a directional and random manner resulted in polyurethane surfaces having sub-micron scale features orientated in a linear or random manner. Results show that when compared with flat (non-patterned) polymer, both the laser processed and abrasive polished surface having randomly organised features, promoted significantly greater cell adhesion, while also enhancing cell proliferation after 72 h. In contrast, the abrasive polished surface having linear features did not enhance cell adhesion or proliferation when compared to the flat surface. For cell migration, the cells growing on the laser processed and abrasively polished random surface showed decreased levels of migration when compared to the flat surface. This study shows that both <b>abrasive</b> <b>polishing</b> and laser processing can be used to produce surfaces having features on the nano-scale and micron-scale, respectively. Surfaces produced using both techniques can be used to promote fibroblast cell adhesion and proliferation. Thus both methods offer a viable alternative to using lithographic techniques for developing patterned surfaces. In particular, <b>abrasive</b> <b>polishing</b> is an attractive method due to it being a simple, rapid and inexpensive method {{that can be used to}} produce surfaces having features on a comparable scale to more expensive, multi-step methods...|$|E
