500|$|One of {{the main}} motivations for {{studying}} book embedding cited by [...] involves an application in VLSI design, to the organization of fault-tolerant multiprocessors. In the DIOGENES system developed by these authors, the CPUs of a multiprocessor system are arranged into a logical sequence corresponding to the spine of a book (although this sequence {{may not necessarily be}} placed along a line in the physical layout of this system). Communication links connecting these processors are grouped into [...] "bundles" [...] which correspond to the pages of a book and act like stacks: connecting one of the processors to {{the start of a new}} communications link pushes all the previous links upward in the bundle, and connecting another processor to the end of a communication link connects it to the one at the bottom of the bundle <b>and</b> <b>pops</b> all the other ones down. Because of this stack behavior, a single bundle can handle a set of communications links that form the edges of a single page in a book embedding. [...] By organizing the links in this way, a wide variety of different network topologies can be implemented, regardless of which processors have become faulty, as long as enough non-faulty processors remain to implement the network. [...] The network topologies that can be implemented by this system are exactly the ones that have book thickness at most equal to the number of bundles that have been made available.|$|E

500|$|Williams {{said the}} album was never {{finished}} {{and because of the}} demand for the record, the distributors insisted the album be completed, otherwise they would cancel the album's orders. This resulted in Dr. Dre mixing the album and inserting the skits within 48 hours, which enabled the album to be released. Rolling Stone writer Jonathan Gold described how Dr. Dre produced a beat from scratch to complete instrumental: [...] "Dre may find something he likes from an old drum break, loop it and gradually replace each part with a better tom-tom sound, a kick-drum sound he adores, until the beat bears the same relationship to the original that the Incredible Hulk does to Bill Bixby". Gold also described how the track progressed with other musicians adding to the song, stating [...] "A bass player wanders in, unpacks his instrument <b>and</b> <b>pops</b> a funky two-note bass line over the beat, then leaves to watch CNN, though his two notes keep looping into infinity. A smiling guy in a striped jersey plays a nasty one-fingered melody on an old Minimoog synthesizer that's been obsolete since 1982, and Dre scratches in a sort of surfadelic munching noise, and then from his well-stocked Akai MPC60 samples comes a shriek, a spare piano chord, an ejaculation from the first Beastie's record -- [...] "Let me clear my throat"—and the many-layered groove is happening, bumping, breathing, almost loud enough to see." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vinyl records do {{not break}} easily, but the soft {{material}} is easily scratched. Vinyl readily acquires a static charge, attracting dust {{that is difficult}} to remove completely. Dust and scratches cause audio clicks <b>and</b> <b>pops.</b> In extreme cases, they can cause the needle to skip over a series of grooves, or worse yet, cause the needle to skip backwards, creating a [...] "locked groove" [...] that repeats over and over. This is the origin of the phrase [...] "like a broken record" [...] or [...] "like a scratched record", which is often used to describe a person or thing that continually repeats itself. Locked grooves are not uncommon and were even heard occasionally in radio broadcasts.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Perimenopausal {{women are}} at high risk for pelvic organ {{prolapse}} (<b>POP)</b> <b>and</b> stress urinary incontinence (SUI) diseases. In the present study, the expression of VIP in the vaginal epithelium of 70 perimenopausal women was correlated with the severity of POP with or without SUI. Materials and Methods: Seventy biopsy specimens from the anterior vaginal epithelium were obtained from postmenopausal patients. Immunohistochemical labeling for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and hematoxylin and eosin staining were performed. The VIP innervation was then compared between eight patient groups. Semiquantitative analysis of VIP protein by Western blotting was performed and compared between the eight patient groups. Results: The results of the immunohistochemical study showed that the intensity of VIP-immunoreactivity (VIP-ir) in the eight groups was as follows (in decreasing order) : Control; POPI; POP II; POP II + SUI; POP III; <b>POP</b> IV <b>and</b> <b>POP</b> III + SUI; <b>and</b> <b>POP</b> IV + SUI. The intensity of VIP-ir was obviously weak and similar among the POP IV, <b>POP</b> III + SUI, <b>and</b> <b>POP</b> IV + SUI groups. This result was validated by the Western blotting analysis. The level of the VIP peptide also deceased in <b>POP</b> patients <b>and</b> was as follows (in decreasing order) : Control; POPI; <b>POP</b> II <b>and</b> <b>POP</b> II + SUI; <b>POP</b> III <b>and</b> POP III + SUI; <b>and</b> <b>POP</b> IV <b>and</b> <b>POP</b> IV + SUI. Conclusion: The present study found that reduced VIP innervation in the vaginal epithelium of the perimenopausal women was correlated with the severity of POP with or without SUI...|$|R
