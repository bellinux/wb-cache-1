40|$|In a {{multimedia}} database, information cannot been always accessed by numeracal or textual attributes, we need often {{to analyze the}} content of images.

40|$|One of the {{topology}} {{that comes}} under distributed control rchitecture in pho-tovoltaic application is di erential power processing. This topology {{is basically a}} minimal power processing technique as the di erential convertors used here pro-vide mismatch current to the series connected PV module string. Series connected PV module su ers from mismatch problem due to di erent level of insolation,shading, or manufacturing variation of di erent sub-module as the current in se-ries connection is same thus the eciency of the PV system is compromised even when a single sub-module is <b>amaged</b> or solar irradiation is not uniform. This dis-tributed architecture uses bidirectional buck-boost convertor to enable the powerow from one module to another in either direction depending on the opening and closing of Mosfet switch which drive the convertor in buck or boost mode. The control algorithm used to achieve true MPPT is an iterative process which uses local voltage measured and neighbor to neighbor communication to update the algorithm and thus ecient tracking. This architecture overcomes {{the problem of the}} conventional power electronics solution for series connected PV module with mismatch, where there is a compromise between system eciency and total power production. Since the di erential convertor deals only with the mismatched power which is just a small fraction of total power and all convertors having same e-ciency the overall eciency can be improved signi cantly. If there is no mismatch between the modules then ideally no power loss will occur in DPP convertor and the eciency of system is limited by central invertor. This algorithm uses graph Laplacian approach where Laplacian matrix is used to obtain information from neighboring PV module. This approach reduces the number of iterations at each step thus improving the tracking speed with no added hardware making it more suitable for long series string PV module. Algorithm along with simulation and its properties are presented in this paper...|$|R

Mixing argon into chlorine {{lead to a}} decrease of the luminescence output compared {{to the case of}} pure C 12 -etched surfaces. This implies that the surface recombina-tion rate of Ar:C 12 -etched surfaces was faster than the C 12 etch and is consistent with more damage induced (11). Photoluminescence may be a useful analysis tool with the advantage of being nondestructive. Conclusion Smooth surfaces and vertical edge profiles were ob-tained for GaAs etched at low pressures and low power densities in our chlorine loadlock RIE system. C-V and I-V measurements of Schottky contacts fabricated on the vari-ous etched surfaces howed that argon etching created a damaged region at the GaAs surface while the pure chlo-rine-induced <b>amage</b> was less and confined to the very near surface region.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the residual radiation damage in x-ray irradiated MOSFET devices after annealing at 400 ~ and 760 mm pressure, in pure H 2. The total incident energy from a conventional A 1 target x-ray source {{was established to}} simulate lithography exposures using the relatively insensitive x-ray resists presently considered for storage ring x-ray lithography. A radiation threshold <b>amage</b> level to the particular MOSFET devices was estimated by controlling the in-cident x-ray flux with radiation blocking layers of various thicknesses. From the data, the minimum x-ray resist sensi-tivity required to expose the MOSFET devices without detrimental effects was estimated. For applications that require resists with lower sensitivity than the estimated minimum value, a multilayer resist structure is proposed to reduce the radiation damage below the threshold value.

Steroid products and their analogs induce oxygen-mediated <b>amage</b> of microsomal P- 450 activities of cultured Leydig cells, whereas testosterone acetate protects P- 450 from this damage [I]. Progesterone and 17 a-hydroxyprogesterone, the nzyme’s substrates, bound stoichiometrically to microsomal P- 450 with unusually high affinity (& = 23 - 51 nM). These properties of the enzyme {{may be responsible for}} the extremely efficient metabolism of these intermediates in androgen biosynthesis. The binding affinities of inhibitory effeetor ligands were determined in competition experiments with the substrates. Several steroids which have varying effects on damage of P- 450 in cultured Leydig cells inhibited substrate binding similarly (&, = 3. 8 - 12. 8 PM). Aminoglutethimide did not inhibit substrate binding. The results suggest that steroid binding to P- 450 is necessary but not suthcient o increase oxygen free-radical damage of the testicular microsomal P- 450. Testosterone acetate, which diminishes P- 450 loss in Leydig cell cultures, was also bound stoichiometrically with high affinity (K,, = 17 nM) and produced a unique spectra, with maxima at 408 nm, an isosbestic point at 418 nm and minima at 428 nm.

40|$|The role of {{inflammation}} in diabetic retinal <b>amage</b> is well accepted. While {{a number}} of cytokines and inflammatory mediators are responsible for these changes, upstream regulators are less well studied. Additionally, the role for these upstream mediators in retinal health is unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that inhibition of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB 1) could restore normal insulin signaling in retinal endothelial cells (REC) grown in high glucose, as well as protect the retina against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) -induced retinal damage. REC were grown in normal (5 mM) or high glucose (25 mM) and treated with Box A or glycyrrhizin, two different HMGB 1 inhibitors. Western blotting was done for HMGB 1, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4), insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate- 1 (IRS- 1), and Akt. ELISA analyses were done for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and cleaved caspase 3. In addition, C 57 /B 6 mice were treated with glycyrrhizin, {{both before and after}} ocular I/R. Two days following I/R, retinal sections were processed for neuronal changes, while vascular damage was measured at 10 days post-I/R. Results demonstrate that both Box A and glycyrrhizin reduced HMGB 1, TLR 4, and TNFα levels in REC grown in high glucose. This led to reduced cleavage of caspase 3 and IRS- 1 Ser 307 phosphorylation, and increased insulin receptor and Akt phosphorylation. Glycyrrhizin treatment significantly reduced loss of retinal thickness and degenerate capillary numbers in mice exposed to I/R. Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of HMGB 1 can reduce retinal insulin resistance, as well as protect the retina against I/R-induced damage...|$|E
