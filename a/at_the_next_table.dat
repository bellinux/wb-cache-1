500|$|Suspicious {{as to why}} Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd {{are living}} in their neighborhood, Stewie and Brian {{investigate}} the house and discover a secret underground military facility, eventually learning that the two actors were made real spies by Ronald Reagan after he saw their film Spies Like Us. Chase and Aykroyd explain that during the Cold War, the Soviet Union turned dozens of American citizens into sleeper agents who would fall into a trance and do the bidding of the KGB upon hearing the phrase, [...] "Gosh, that Italian family <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>table</b> sure is quiet" [...] – a phrase no one would normally use. They later explain {{that one of the}} sleeper agents resides in Quahog, and they are looking for him/her. Chase and Aykroyd ask Brian and Stewie to help them in their mission, noting that they know several people acting very strangely in Quahog. Brian and Stewie accept the offer.|$|E
500|$|Pinter's last stage play, Celebration (2000), is {{a social}} satire set in an opulent restaurant, which lampoons The Ivy, a fashionable venue in London's West End theatre district, and its patrons who [...] "have just come from {{performances}} of either the ballet or the opera. Not that they can remember a darn thing about what they saw, including the titles. [...] gilded, foul-mouthed souls are just as myopic {{when it comes to}} their own table mates (and for that matter, their food), with conversations that usually connect only on the surface, if there." [...] On its surface the play may appear to have fewer overtly political resonances than some of the plays from the 1980s and 1990s; but its central male characters, brothers named Lambert and Matt, are members of the elite (like the men in charge in Party Time), who describe themselves as [...] "peaceful strategy consultants [...] we don't carry guns." [...] <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>table,</b> Russell, a banker, describes himself as a [...] "totally disordered personality... a psychopath," [...] while Lambert [...] "vows to be reincarnated as ' more civilised, [...] gentler person, [...] nicer person'." [...] These characters' deceptively smooth exteriors mask their extreme viciousness. [...] Celebration evokes familiar Pinteresque political contexts: [...] "The ritzy loudmouths in 'Celebration'... and the quieter working-class mumblers of 'The Room'... have everything in common beneath the surface". [...] "Money remains in the service of entrenched power, and the brothers in the play are 'strategy consultants' whose jobs involve force and violence... It is tempting but inaccurate to equate the comic power inversions of the social behavior in Celebration with lasting change in larger political structures", according to Grimes, for whom the play indicates Pinter's pessimism about the possibility of changing the status quo. [...] Yet, as the Waiter's often comically unbelievable reminiscences about his grandfather demonstrate in Celebration, Pinter's final stage plays also extend some expressionistic aspects of his earlier [...] "memory plays", while harking back to his [...] "comedies of menace", as illustrated in the characters and in the Waiter's final speech: ...|$|E
2500|$|She went {{forth in}} search of a tea-shop and philanthropic adventure. ... In a corner of an A.B.C. shop she found an unoccupied table, whereat she {{promptly}} installed herself, impelled by the fact that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>table</b> was sitting a young girl, rather plain of feature, with tired, listless eyes and a general air of uncomplaining forlornness.|$|E

2500|$|On {{her first}} night in the Bohemian {{community}} {{she went to the}} café La Rotonde where the man <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>table</b> introduced himself as [...] "Modigliani, painter and Jew". In addition to making close friends with Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso, Serge Diaghilev, and Jean Cocteau, she stayed for a while at La Ruche with many of the leading members of the avant-garde living there at the time. In Montparnasse she also met her future husband, the Norwegian artist Roald Kristian.|$|E
2500|$|Known as Modì (which {{plays on}} the French word 'maudit', meaning 'cursed') by many Parisians, but as Dedo {{to his family and}} friends, Modigliani was a {{handsome}} man, and attracted much female attention. Women came and went until Beatrice Hastings entered his life. She stayed with him for almost two years, was the subject of several of his portraits, including Madame Pompadour, and the object of much of his drunken wrath. When the British painter Nina Hamnett arrived in Montparnasse in 1914, on her first evening there the smiling man <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>table</b> in the café introduced himself as [...] "Modigliani, painter and Jew". They became great friends.|$|E
2500|$|Montparnasse was a {{community}} where creativity was embraced with all its oddities, each new arrival welcomed unreservedly by its existing members. When Tsuguharu Foujita arrived from Japan in 1913 not knowing a soul, he met Soutine, Modigliani, Pascin and Léger virtually the same night and within a week became friends with Juan Gris, Picasso and Matisse. In 1914, when the English painter Nina Hamnett arrived in Montparnasse, on her first evening the smiling man <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>table</b> at La Rotonde graciously introduced himself as [...] "Modigliani, painter and Jew". They became good friends, Hamnett later recounting how she once borrowed a jersey and corduroy trousers from Modigliani, then went to La Rotonde and danced in the street all night.|$|E

60|$|He was on {{the point}} of sitting down when he saw Brooks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>table.</b> He held out his hand.|$|E

50|$|Zhuang {{was born}} in August 1940 and he joined the Chinese National Table Tennis team as a teenager. His coach was Fu Qifang.

60|$|He looked up. Opposite him, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>table,</b> {{was seated}} a youth of fifteen, of a {{slightly}} grubby aspect. He was eyeing Clarence closely.|$|E

5000|$|When {{he reached}} the classroom, Milagros was {{surprised}} by the elegance and personality of the man.

50|$|An {{older man}} (Hall) {{is sitting at}} a table with a younger man (Kirk Baltz) at a diner {{discussing}} a matter over cigarettes and coffee.

He shouts at Jed, causing a scene when Jed tells him to [...] "be brave" [...] again. Joe tells Jed that all he wants is for Jed to leave him alone, which after hearing this, Jed leaves the restaurant.|$|R
25|$|Once the two-party {{majorities}} in all seats are known, {{they can then}} be arranged in a table to show {{the order in which}} they would be lost {{in the event of an}} adverse swing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> election.

6000|$|Una was {{not highly}} {{successful}} in her make-believe. She could not picture the imaginary man who walked beside her.

But she was throbbingly sure he was there as she entered a drug-store and bought a [...] "Berline bonbon," [...] a confection guaranteed to increase the chronic nervous indigestion from which stenographers suffer. Her shadow lover tried to hold her hand. She snatched it away and blushed. She fancied that a matron <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> tiny <b>table</b> was watching her silly play, reflected in the enormous mirror behind the marble soda-counter. The lover vanished. As she left the drug-store Una was pretending {{that she was still}} pretending, but found it difficult to feel so very exhilarated.|$|R
60|$|As {{they sat}} {{discussing}} New York's shortcomings over their coffee, {{a young man}} passed them, carrying a basket, and seated himself <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>table.</b> He was a tall, loose-jointed young man, with unkempt hair.|$|E

60|$|They drank more wine; {{they drank}} liqueurs, cognac, beer, then more liqueurs and more cognac. Two strangers sitting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>table</b> looked at him, he said, {{with so much}} friendliness, that he invited them to join the party.|$|E
50|$|Nancy {{spends the}} evening with her boyfriend <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Downtown Club, a notorious hangout {{for members of the}} {{criminal}} underworld. Quite recently the club was the scene of a murder. Nancy witnesses what she believes is a holdup <b>at</b> <b>the</b> very <b>next</b> <b>table,</b> and instinctively she hits the gunman over the head with a champagne bottle, knocking him out completely. The gunman, Sam Boone, is really an undercover police officer posing as a gangster, who was trying to make an arrest when Nancy hit him. Even though Nancy and Sam really didn’t meet under the best of circumstances, they soon take a liking to each other, and eventually marry. Exactly two years later they return to the Downtown Club and the ”crime scene” in order to celebrate their first meeting.|$|R

She then tells John that [...] "Maybe Chryzinium isn't as bad as we..." [...] John stops her mid sentence. [...] "He got to you didn't he?" [...] They have a short {{conversation}} about Chryzinium and John warns her about it.|$|R
6000|$|Presently {{through the}} muffled roar and hum of voices which echoed in his sleep-dulled ears, {{he caught the}} sound of a {{familiar}} name, that woke him up [...] "all of a heap," [...] as he afterwards said. The name was [...] "Quest." [...] Without moving his body he opened his eyes. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> very <b>next</b> <b>table</b> to his own were seated two people, a man and a woman. He looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> latter first. She was clad in yellow, and was very tall, thin and fierce-looking; so fierce-looking that George involuntarily jerked his head back, and brought it with painful force in contact with the wall. It was the Tiger herself, and her companion was the coarse, dreadful-looking man called Johnnie, whom she had sent away in the cab on the night of Mr. Quest's visit.|$|R
