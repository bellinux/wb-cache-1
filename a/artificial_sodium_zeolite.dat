40|$|ABSTRACT To {{determine}} whether particle size oiCaCO ^ influences the hen's response to <b>sodium</b> <b>zeolite</b> A (ZA), two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, hens were fed 0,. 75, and 1. 50 % ZA for 6 wk {{with and without}} a Na correction. At {{the end of the}} 4 th wk, pullet-sized limestone was substituted for 50 % of the added fine granular limestone in the diet containing no ZA. In Experiment 2, hens were fed diets containing 0,. 68, and 1. 36 ZA for 8 wk with and without one-half of the added fine granular limestone substituted for oyster shell. No correction for Na was made. A dietary calcium concentration of 2. 75 % was used in Experiment 1 and 3. 5 % in Experiment 2. Egg specific gravity, egg production, feed consumption, and egg weight were measured. <b>Sodium</b> <b>zeolite</b> A increased egg specific gravity, and the beneficial effects of ZA were maintained during Weeks 5 and 6 when pullet-sized limestone was added to the control diet containing no ZA (Experiment 1). Oyster shell and ZA improved egg specific gravity in Experiment 2 and the effect was additive. Dietary treatments had no effect on egg production or egg weight in Experiments 1 or 2 and there was no effect on feed consumption (Experiment 1). Feed consumption was reduced by ZA, when hens were fed oyster shell, but not when they were fed ZA with fine granular limestone (Experiment 2). It was concluded that the beneficial effect of ZA on egg specific gravity was independent of particle size of CaCX> 3 in the diet.

Both zeolites proved to be effective as pozzolanic materials. Their action involved various steps, including (1) cation exchange, (2) dissolution and/or breakdown of the zeolitic structure, (3) possible formation of transient gel phases, and (4) precipitation of hydrated calcium silicates and aluminates. Pozzolanic activity was demonstrated to depend on zeolite structure. Zeolite A reacted, in fact, more readily than zeolite X.

Young children are the most sensitive segment of the population. Addition of amendments to the soil is a feasible technique to reduce the availability of trace metals.

40|$|International audienceMolecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{at temperatures}} of 270, 330, and 390 K {{have been carried}} out to address the question of cation migration upon chloroform sorption in <b>sodium</b> <b>zeolite</b> Y. The results show that sodium cations located in different sites exhibit different types of mobility. These may be summarized as follows: (1) SII cations migrate {{toward the center of the}} supercage upon sorption, due to interactions with the polar sorbate molecules. (2) SI‘ cations hop from the sodalite cage into the supercage to fill vacant SII sites. (3) SI‘ cations migrate to other SI‘ sites within the same sodalite cage. (4) SI cations hop out of the double six-rings into SI‘ sites. In some instances, concerted motion of cations is observed. Furthermore, former SI‘ and SI cations, having crossed to SII sites, may then further migrate within the supercage, as in (1). The cation motion is dependent on the level of sorbate loading, with 10 molecules per unit cell not being enough to induce significant cation displacements, whereas the sorption of 40 molecules per unit cell results in a number of cations being displaced from their original positions. Further rearrangement of the cation positions is observed upon evacuation of the simulation cell, with some cations reverting back to sites normally occupied in bare NaY...|$|R

RESULTS Increasing the temperature during the modification step to magnesium form improved the zeolite conversion. The maximum sorption capacities obtained were 123. 1 ± 9. 1 mg NH 4 g- 1 and 119. 5 ± 7. 5 mg PO 4 g- 1 in an ammonium/phosphate binary system for Ze-Ca, while 55. 2 ± 2. 4 / 60. 5 ± 14. 1 and 32. 3 ± 4. 4 / 23. 9 ± 3. 4 were obtained for Ze-Mg 1 and Ze-Mg 2, respectively. The sorption process is faster for Ze-Mg zeolites and the sorption mechanism that controls the overall process, for both zeolites, is diffusion into the particle according to the HPDM and SPM models. CONCLUSIONS Salt modification improved the performance of zeolites towards phosphate sorption. The sorption mechanism involves both ammonium exchange to the Mg and Ca ions, and precipitation of Ca and Mg phosphates or mixed ammonium-magnesium phosphate minerals such as brushite (CaHPO 4.
