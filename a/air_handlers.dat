2500|$|The major use of {{ethylene}} glycol is {{as a medium}} for convective heat transfer in, for example, automobiles and liquid-cooled computers. [...] Ethylene glycol is also commonly used in chilled-water air-conditioning systems that place either the chiller or <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> outside, or systems that must cool below the freezing temperature of water. In geothermal heating/cooling systems, {{ethylene glycol}} is the fluid that transports heat {{through the use of}} a geothermal heat pump. [...] The ethylene glycol either gains energy from the source (lake, ocean, water well) or dissipates heat to the sink, depending on whether the system is being used for heating or cooling.|$|E

50|$|Larger <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> will be {{manufactured}} from a square section steel framing system with double skinned and insulated infill panels. Such constructions reduce heat loss or heat {{gain from the}} air handler, {{as well as providing}} acoustic attenuation. Larger <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> may be several meters long and are manufactured in a sectional manner and therefore, for strength and rigidity, steel section base rails are provided under the unit.|$|E
50|$|A {{duct system}} often begins at an <b>air</b> <b>handler.</b> The blowers in the <b>air</b> <b>handler</b> can create {{substantial}} vibration, {{and the large}} area of the duct system would transmit this noise and vibration to {{the inhabitants of the}} building. To avoid this, vibration isolators (flexible sections) are normally inserted into the duct immediately before and after the <b>air</b> <b>handler.</b> The rubberized canvas-like material of these sections allows the <b>air</b> <b>handler</b> to vibrate without transmitting much vibration to the attached ducts. The same flexible section can reduce the noise that can occur when the blower engages and positive air pressure is introduced to the ductwork.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Air</b> <b>handlers</b> {{typically}} {{employ a}} large squirrel cage blower {{driven by an}} AC induction electric motor to move the air. The blower may operate at a single speed, {{offer a variety of}} set speeds, or be driven by a Variable Frequency Drive to allow a wide range of air flow rates. Flow rate may also be controlled by inlet vanes or outlet dampers on the fan. Some residential <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> in USA (central [...] "furnaces" [...] or [...] "air conditioners") use a brushless DC electric motor that has variable speed capabilities. [...] <b>Air</b> <b>handlers</b> in Europe and Australia and New Zealand now commonly use backward curve fans without scroll or [...] "plug fans". These are driven using high efficiency EC (electronically commutated) motors with built in speed control.|$|E

50|$|In larger {{commercial}} applications, {{central heating}} is provided through an <b>air</b> <b>handler</b> which incorporates similar components as a furnace {{but on a}} larger scale.|$|R
50|$|A {{refrigerant}} coil {{is located}} in the <b>air</b> <b>handler</b> instead of a burner/heat exchanger. System can also be used in cooling, just as any central air-conditioning system.|$|R

50|$|The two wings have flat roofs {{pierced by}} brick {{chimneys}} topped with steel <b>air</b> <b>handlers.</b> On the front {{they have one}} six-over-six window. The west (rear) facade echoes the front with three large sash windows.|$|E
5000|$|Chilled {{water cooling}} {{is not very}} {{different}} from typical residential air conditioning where water is pumped from the chiller to the <b>air</b> <b>handler</b> unit to cool the air.|$|R
50|$|The air blower's {{flow rate}} is variable. For a single VAV <b>air</b> <b>handler</b> that serves {{multiple}} thermal zones, the flow rate to each zone must be varied as well.|$|R
5000|$|A heat {{recovery}} device heat exchanger of many types, may be fitted to the <b>air</b> <b>handler</b> between supply and extract airstreams for energy savings and increasing capacity. These types more commonly include for: ...|$|R
50|$|Where {{supply and}} extract air is {{required}} in equal proportions for a balanced ventilation system, {{it is common for}} the supply and extract <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> to be joined together, either in a side-by-side or a stacked configuration.|$|E
50|$|Very {{large scale}} {{systems can be}} built using the two-pipe principle. For example, rather than heating {{individual}} radiators, the water {{may be used in}} the reheat coils of large <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> to heat an entire floor of a building.|$|E
50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>handlers</b> {{may need}} to provide heating, cooling, or both to change the supply air temperature, and {{humidity}} level depending on the location and the application. Such conditioning is provided by heat exchanger coil(s) within the air handling unit air stream, such coils may be direct or indirect {{in relation to the}} medium providing the heating or cooling effect.|$|E
50|$|Regardless of who {{provides}} it, the chilled water (between 4° and 7°C (39-44 °F)) is pumped through an <b>air</b> <b>handler,</b> which captures {{the heat from}} the air, then disperses the air throughout the area to be cooled.|$|R
50|$|A heat {{exchanger}} (hydronic coil) {{is placed in}} the <b>air</b> <b>handler</b> similar to the refrigerant coil in a Heat Pump system or a Central AC. Copper is often specified in supply and return manifolds and in tube coils.|$|R

50|$|In {{buildings}} with HVAC <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> that admit outside air for ventilation, plumbing vents placed too closely to air intakes or windows {{can be a}} source of sewer gas odors. In some cases airflow around buildings and wind effects may contribute to sewer gas odor problems even with appropriately separated vents and air intakes. Increasing vent heights, adding vent pipe filters, or providing powered dilution and exhaust can help reduce occurrences.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} indoor air quality, <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> commonly have provisions to allow the introduction of outside air into, and the exhausting of air from the building. In temperate climates, mixing {{the right amount of}} cooler outside air with warmer return air can be used to approach the desired supply air temperature. A mixing chamber is therefore used which has dampers controlling the ratio between the return, outside, and exhaust air.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> mix {{return and}} outside air so less temperature/humidity {{conditioning}} is needed. This {{can save money}} by using less chilled or heated water (not all AHUs use chilled or hot water circuits). Some external air is {{needed to keep the}} building's air healthy. To optimize energy efficiency while maintaining healthy indoor air quality (IAQ), demand control (or controlled) ventilation (DCV) adjusts the amount of outside air based on measured levels of occupancy.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary goal}} {{of the project was}} to make the machine {{maintenance}} process more efficient. In order to do this, we conducted a 3 -day Value Stream Mapping workshop, during which we generated a map of the present value stream. We identified shortcomings and inefficiencies within this value stream, and then mapped out a future state Value Stream, creating a 90 -day action plan to move towards that desired future state. This action plan relied heavily upon measuring and improving key performance indicators, which allowed us to make objective measures of our progress. A second internship objective was {{to reduce the number of}} clean room re-sanitizations. Currently, clean rooms undergo a costly and time-consuming re-sanitization whenever an <b>air</b> <b>handler</b> is shut down for a brief period of time. It is likely that some of these cleanings are unnecessary, and eliminating extraneous cleanings could reduce maintenance costs significantly. In order to reduce unnecessary clean room re-sanitizations, we designed and conducted a study to measure environmental standards during an <b>air</b> <b>handler</b> shutdown. Genzyme's Validation and Quality Control Departments approved this experimental plan prior to execution. We shut down an <b>air</b> <b>handler</b> that supplied a clean room, and monitored the air for viable and non-viable particles for several hours. Viable particulate levels did not exceed action limits during a four-hour shutdown, and non-viable particulates dropped to pre-experiment levels as soon as we re-started the <b>air</b> <b>handler.</b> Based on these results, we conclude that air-handler shutdowns should not require room re-sanitization. by Dana Ari Levine.

50|$|Controls are {{necessary}} to regulate every aspect of an <b>air</b> <b>handler,</b> such as: flow rate of air, supply air temperature, mixed air temperature, humidity, air quality. They may {{be as simple as}} an off/on thermostat or as complex as a building automation system using BACnet or LonWorks, for example.|$|R
50|$|Small <b>air</b> <b>handlers,</b> {{for local}} use, are called {{terminal}} units, and may only include an air filter, coil, and blower; these simple terminal units are called blower coils or fan coil units. A larger air handler that conditions 100% outside air, and no recirculated air, {{is known as}} a makeup air unit (MAU). An air handler designed for outdoor use, typically on roofs, {{is known as a}} packaged unit (PU) or rooftop unit (RTU).|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{itself is a}} two-story square-shaped brick building with an enclosed courtyard in the middle. The main block, oriented north-south along North Main, has a side-gabled roof shingled in asphalt, pierced by engaged brick chimneys at the ends and aluminum <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> in the middle. A central pavilion projects slightly from the facade. Similarly treated wings project to the west from its north and south ends. A single-story flat-roofed west wing forms {{the southwest corner of}} the courtyard.|$|E
50|$|In the winter, {{when the}} {{temperature}} drops to a certain degree, the building will be preheated to 23 °C (74 °F) {{in the early morning}} by the combination of <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> and heat water beams in specific areas in the office spaces. And during the working hours, the heater will be turned off and the building heating will be fully relied on the internal heat gain from the computers, printers, and heat generated from the human bodies.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical, or forced, {{ventilation}} {{is provided}} by an <b>air</b> <b>handler</b> (AHU) and used to control indoor air quality. Excess humidity, odors, and contaminants can often be controlled via dilution or replacement with outside air. However, in humid climates more energy is required to remove excess moisture from ventilation air.|$|R
50|$|The {{equipment}} that regulates the airflow {{is called a}} damper. The damper {{can be used to}} increase, decrease or completely stop the flow of air.
