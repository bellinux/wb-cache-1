5|$|After the Congress of Vienna, a small Kingdom of Poland, {{known as}} Congress Poland, was recreated, with its king being the Tsar of Russia, Alexander I. Alexander I, <b>an</b> <b>enlightened</b> autocrat, {{decided to use}} Congress Poland as an {{experiment}} to see if Russian autocratic rule could be mixed with an elective legislative system, and rule Poland as a constitutional monarchy. At that time many hoped that this experiment would be a success and pave way to a liberalization in Russia; {{in the end it}} proved to be a failure.|$|E
5|$|Charles Smithson – {{the main}} male character. Though {{born into a}} family {{with close ties to}} nobility, Smithson does not possess a title but has a sizable income and {{considerable}} education. Early in the novel he is described both as a casual naturalist and a Darwinist. Though trying to become <b>an</b> <b>enlightened</b> and forward-thinking individual, the narrator often emphasises, through commentary on Smithson's actions and situation, that his identity is strongly rooted in the traditional social system.

5|$|Mahatma Gandhi's life {{achievement}} stands {{unique in}} political history. He has invented {{a completely new}} and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only {{be the work of}} such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works.
