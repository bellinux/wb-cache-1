Despite firing two shots at a television set and a window, Auvinen left the classroom without shooting anyone.|$|E

25|$|On December 19, 1961, Kennedy {{suffered}} a stroke at age 73. He survived but was left paralyzed on his right side. Thereafter, he suffered from aphasia, which severely affected his ability to speak. He remained mentally alert, regained certain functions with therapy, <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>walking</b> with a cane. His speech also showed some improvement. Kennedy began to experience excessive muscular weakness, which eventually required him to use a wheelchair. In 1964, Kennedy was taken to The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential in Philadelphia, a medical and rehabilitative center {{for those who have}} experienced brain injury.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few other}} riders were found, {{including}} Rik Van Looy, and some obliged and others refused. Next morning, the race {{left the city}} {{on the way to the}} Pyrenees and stopped in the suburb of Gradignan, in the university area of La House. The riders climbed off <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>walking,</b> shouting protests in general and in particular abuse at the race doctor, Pierre Dumas, whom some demanded should also take a test to see if he'd been drinking wine or taking aspirin to make his own job easier. Riders also criticised Poulidor for accepting to be tested. He dismissed their protests and stayed at the back of the strike. Other prominent riders, including Jacques Anquetil, were at the front. Poulidor said his indifference to the controls and the strike harmed his relations with fellow riders. [...] "After that, they did me no favours in the peloton", he said.|$|E
2500|$|His {{impressive}} KO wins then {{earned him}} a chance to compete in a superfight at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2009 in Seoul Final 16 on September 26, where he faced Japanese karate fighter Taiei Kin in a highly-controversial bout. Towards {{the end of the first}} round, the [...] "clapper" [...] (the device used to signal the remaining 10 seconds of the round) sounded. Moroşanu seemed to think the sound indicative of the ending of the round, <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>walking</b> towards his corner, only to be met by a punch from Kin (who was rightfully continuing in the context of the official rules regarding the fight). The end bell, signifying the officially sanctioned end of the round, sounded moments later. [...] Moroşanu deliberately continued to fight, hitting Taiei (who was defenseless after dropping his hands at the end of the round) with a two punch flurry, knocking him unconscious. Moroşanu was disqualified from the fight, thus giving the victory to Taiei by means of disqualification.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2007 Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz {{announced}} that the interview phase of the beatification process, in Italy and Poland, was nearing completion. In February 2007, second class relics of Pope John Paul II—pieces of white papal cassocks he used to wear—were freely distributed with prayer cards for the cause, a typical pious practice after a saintly Catholic's death. On 8 March 2007, the Vicariate of Rome {{announced that}} the diocesan phase of John Paul's cause for beatification was at an end. Following a ceremony on 2 April 2007—the second anniversary of the Pontiff's death—the cause proceeded to the scrutiny of the committee of lay, clerical, and episcopal members of the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints, to conduct a separate investigation. On the fourth anniversary of Pope John Paul's death, 2 April 2009, Cardinal Dziwisz, told reporters of a presumed miracle that had recently occurred at the former pope's tomb in St. Peter's Basilica. A nine-year-old Polish boy from Gdańsk, who was suffering from kidney cancer and was completely unable to walk, had been visiting the tomb with his parents. On leaving St. Peter's Basilica, the boy told them, [...] "I want to walk," [...] <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>walking</b> normally. On 16 November 2009, a panel of reviewers at the Congregation for the Causes of Saints voted unanimously that Pope John PaulII had lived a life of heroic virtue. On 19 December 2009, Pope Benedict XVI signed {{the first of two}} decrees needed for beatification and proclaimed John Paul II [...] "Venerable", asserting that he had lived a heroic, virtuous life. The second vote and the second signed decree certifying the authenticity of the first miracle, the curing of Sister Marie Simon-Pierre, a French nun, from Parkinson's disease. Once the second decree is signed, the positio (the report on the cause, with documentation about his life and writings and with information on the cause) is complete. He can then be beatified. Some speculated that he would be beatified sometime during (or soon after) the month of the 32nd anniversary of his 1978 election, in October 2010. As Monsignor Oder noted, this course would have been possible if the second decree were signed in time by Benedict XVI, stating that a posthumous miracle directly attributable to his intercession had occurred, completing the positio.|$|E
