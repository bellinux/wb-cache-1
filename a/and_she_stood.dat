2500|$|In March 2005, Mussolini {{was banned}} {{by a local}} court from {{regional}} elections held the following month for presenting fraudulent signatures. [...] "This is an affront to democracy, if they're going to exclude the Social Alternative {{they will have to}} exclude all the parties, because all the signature lists are false", Mussolini told Reuters. Mussolini went on a hunger strike to protest the decision. However, {{at the end of the}} month Italy's top administrative court, the Council of State, annulled the decision <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> for election.|$|E
2500|$|Russell's {{measurements}} were 38D-24-36, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> 5ft 7 in (97-61-91cm and 1.7 m), making her more statuesque {{than most of}} her contemporaries. Her favorite co-star Bob Hope once introduced her as [...] "the two and only Jane Russell". He joked, [...] "Culture {{is the ability to}} describe Jane Russell without moving your hands." [...] Howard Hughes said, [...] "There are two good reasons why men go to see her. Those are enough." [...] A publicity still for the movie showed her lying on a pile of straw, her blouse stretched tight across her voluptuous breasts. Her right hand was behind her head of black hair and her left hand held a revolver. The image was a popular pin-up photo with servicemen during World War II. She did not appear in another movie until 1946, when she played Joan Kenwood in Young Widow for RKO.|$|E

2500|$|His book Either/Or {{discussed}} {{whether or}} not love can be deceived. Is it {{a good thing to}} find out you have been deceived or is it something that makes you angry? Kierkegaard had already discussed anger in his Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 where he quoted The Epistle of James, Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger, because man’s anger does not work what is righteous before God. (James 1:17-22) Earlier in the same discourse he had discussed equality. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. He asks pointed questions, [...] "Did the woman who was a sinner feel her guilt more deeply when the scribes were accusing her than when there was no accuser anymore <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> alone before the Lord! But you also realize that the most dangerously deceived person is the one who is self-deceived, that the most dangerous condition is that of the one who is deceived by much knowledge, and, furthermore, that it is a lamentable weakness to have one’s consolation in another’s light-mindedness, {{but it is also a}} lamentable weakness to have one’s terror from another’s heavy-mindedness. Leave it solely to God-after all, he knows best how to take care of everything for one who becomes alone by seeking him." ...|$|E
