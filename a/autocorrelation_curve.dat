40|$|International audienceAmbient {{vibration}} {{techniques are}} promising methods {{for assessing the}} subsurface structure, in particular the shear-wave velocity profile (Vs). They {{are based on the}} dispersion property of surface waves in layered media. Therefore, the penetration depth is intrinsically linked to the energy content of the sources. For ambient vibrations, the spectral content extends in general to lower frequency when compared to classical artificial sources. Among available methods for processing recorded signals, we focus here on the spatial autocorrelation method. For stationary wavefields, the spatial autocorrelation is mathematically related to the frequency-dependent wave velocity c({omega}). This allows the determination of the dispersion curve of traveling surface waves, which, in turn, is linked to the Vs profile. Here, we propose a direct inversion scheme for the observed <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>curves</b> to retrieve, in a single step, the Vs profile. The powerful neighborhood algorithm is used to efficiently search for all solutions in an n-dimensional parameter space. This approach has the advantage of taking into account the existing uncertainty over the measured curves, thus generating all Vs profiles that fit the data within their experimental errors. A preprocessing tool is also developed to estimate the validity of the <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>curves</b> and to reject parts of them if necessary before starting the inversion itself. We present two synthetic cases to test the potential of the method: one with ideal <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>curves</b> and another with <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>curves</b> computed from simulated ambient vibrations. The latter case is more realistic and makes it possible to figure out the problems that may be encountered in real experiments. The Vs profiles are correctly retrieved up to the depth of the first major velocity contrast unless low-velocity zones are accepted. We demonstrate that accepting low-velocity zones in the parameterization has a dramatic influence on the result of the inversion, with a considerable increase in the nonuniqueness of the problem. Finally, a real data set is processed with the same method...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{diffusing}} wave spectroscopy (DWS) is used {{to investigate}} the effect of shear on a food-related aggregating emulsion. The principle of the method is validated using a nonaggregating, nearly monodisperse latex suspension. In general, with increasing shear rate the diffusive motion of the scatterers becomes negligible compared to the convective motion. This causes {{a decrease in the}} decay time of the <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>curves</b> and a change {{in the form of the}} <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>curves</b> from nearly exponential to Gaussian. This is reflected in the exponent of the mean square displacement that changes from 1 to 2. The effect of shear on the acidification of a sodium caseinate-stabilized emulsion was studied by DWS and by rheometry. The emulsion droplets in the food-related emulsion were uniformly dispersed at neutral pH. Upon acidification down to a pH of 5. 2 0. 05, the emulsion showed Newtonian behavior with constant viscosity over the whole pH range. At pH 5. 17 0. 05, independent of the applied shear rate during acidification, the viscosity suddenly increased. From this point on, the emulsion showed shear-thinning behavior. The photon-transport mean free path (l*) was not influenced by the applied shear rate and did not change down to pH 5. 2 0. 05. Close to this pH, l* increased, and the decay of the <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>curves</b> shifted to longer correlation times when shear rates smaller than 1 s¿ 1 were applied. At lower pH (5. 05 0. 05), l* started to fluctuate, and the <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>curves</b> no longer decayed to zero, indicating that at these shear rates the system behaved nonergodicly. Assuming that the convective motion and the Brownian motion are independent of each other, the mean square displacement as a result of Brownian motion was determined. From this, the sol¿gel point and the radius of the aggregates at this point as a function of the shear rate was determined. The results indicated that the radius of the aggregates at the sol¿gel transition decreased with increasing shear rate and suggested that shear will result in a more open structure of the network formed by the aggregate...|$|R

To this end, we analyzed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) using two-photon excitation the intracellular concentration and diffusion properties of labeled PEI and PEI/DNA complexes in various compartments of L 929 cells.

In this work, confocal fluorescence microscopy experiments have been carried out on giant unilamellar vesicles, a system that mimics cellular compartmentalisation.

In particular, when P(B) << 1 (i. e. in the fast diffusion regime), the photobleaching rate is independent of the diffusion constant and scales like sigma(B) P/R 2, in agreement with the experimental results.

Biological membranes are complex structures, whose physico-chemical properties depend on the local lipid composition, cholesterol content {{and the presence of}} integral or peripheral membrane proteins, which may be involved in supramolecular complexes or are linked to cellular matrix proteins or the cytoskeleton. The high proteinto- lipid ratios in biomembranes indicate that membrane proteins are particularly subject to molecular crowding, making it difficult to follow the track of individual molecules carrying a fluorescence label. Novel switchable fluorescence proteins such as Dreiklang [1], are, in principle, promising tools to study the diffusion behavior of individual molecules in situations of molecular crowding due to excellent spectral control of the ON- and OFF-switching process. In this work, we expressed an integral membrane transport protein, the Na,K-ATPase comprising the human α 2 -subunit carrying an N-terminal eGFP or Dreiklang tag and human β 1 -subunit, in HEK 293 T cells and measured <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>curves</b> by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS).

However, measurements of such dispersion curves using ambient seismic vibrations require a large number of seismometers and a long measuring time. As a simple alternative, we propose to invert Rayleigh wave ellipticity obtained by ambient seismic noise measurements at a single site using a method based on the random decrement technique (Hobiger et al., 2009). Indeed, the freSeismological Research Letters Volume 81, Number 2 March/April 2010 305 quency-dependency of Rayleigh wave ellipticity is tightly related to the shear wave profile of the soil. However, as different {{soil structure}}s can result in the same ellipticity curve (e. g. homothetic structures in velocity and thickness), the inversion of ellipticity curves alone is ambiguous. Therefore, additional measurements fixing the shearwave velocity in the superficial layers have to be included into the inversion process.

With the objective of defining a strategy to achieve reliable results for microtremor on a shallow structure, we analyse synthetic ambient vibrations (vertical component) simulated with 333 broad-band sources for a 25 m deep soil layer overlying a bedrock. The first part of our study is focused on the determination of the reliable frequency range of the spectral curves (dispersion or autocorrelation) for a given array geometry. We find that the wave number limits deduced from the theoretical array response are good estimates of the valid spectral curve range. In the second part, the spectral curves are calculated with the three most popular noise-processing techniques (frequency-wavenumber, high resolution frequency-wavenumber and spatial auto-correlation methods) and inverted individually in each case. The inversions are performed with a tool based on the neighbourhood algorithm which oers a better estimation of the global uncertainties than classical linearized methods, especially if the solution is not unique. Several array apertures are necessary to construct the dispersion (autocorrelation) curves in the appropriate frequency range. Considering the final velocity profiles, the three tested methods are almost equivalent and no significant advantage was found for one particular method. With the chosen model, all methods exhibit a penetration limited to the bedrock depth, as a consequence of the filtering eect of the ground structure on the vertical component, which was observed in numerous shallow sites...|$|E
40|$|Kinesin- 1 motor {{proteins}} {{move along}} microtubules in repetitive steps of 8 nm {{at the expense}} of ATP. To determine nucleotide dwell times during these processive runs, we used a Förster resonance energy transfer method at the single-molecule level that detects nucleotide binding to kinesin motor heads. We show that the fluorescent ATP analog used produces processive motility with kinetic parameters altered < 2. 5 -fold compared with normal ATP. Using our confocal fluorescence kinesin motility assay, we obtained fluorescence intensity time traces that we then analyzed using autocorrelation techniques, yielding a time resolution of ∼ 1 ms for the intensity fluctuations due to fluorescent nucleotide binding and release. To compare these experimental <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>curves</b> with kinetic models, we used Monte-Carlo simulations. We find that the experimental data can only be described satisfactorily on the basis of models assuming an alternating-site mechanism, thus supporting the view that kinesin's two motor domains hydrolyze ATP and step in a sequential way. © 2009 by the Biophysical Society...|$|R
40|$|Using two-photon {{excitation}} (TPE) at 700 nm {{as well as}} one-photon excitation (OPE) at 350 nm, we applied confocal {{fluorescence microscopy}} to detect single Coumarin- 120 molecules in the solvents water and triacetin. To study the behavior of Coumarin- 120 under different excitation conditions, fluorescence lifetimes, multichannel scaler traces, and <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>curves</b> have been measured simultaneously. A signal-to-background ratio of 1300 was achieved for TPE due to a very low background level. The detection efficiency of TPE is limited by other competing nonlinear processes, in particular continuum generation in the solvent. The applicable laser intensity for OPE is limited by two-step photolysis of the dye as shown by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). The time-resolved fluorescence signals were analyzed by a maximum likelihood estimator to identify the fluorophore through its characteristic fluorescence lifetime. The average fluorescence lifetimes 4. 8 ± 1. 2 ns in water and 3. 3 ± 0. 6 ns in triacetin are in good agreement with results obtained from separate measurements at higher concentrations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{fluorescence}} correlation spectroscopy setup based on a software correlator. The setup can process <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>curves</b> in real-time at countrate as high as 8 MHz, with time resoln. of 1 μs. It uses the F 2 Cor autocorrelation algorithm, a low cost counting board and a desktop computer. Sym. normalization, which improves the {{signal to noise ratio}} of the FCS curve for large values of the lag-time, is adapted to the F 2 Cor algorithm. A new acquisition mode, which we call oscilloscope-mode, is presented. It takes advantage of the flexibility F 2 Cor, and proves to be very useful for optical setup adjustment. As an application of this setup, we performed FCS measurements on a ref. tetramethylrhodamine soln. at high concn., up to 2. 5 μM, which extend to the micromolar range the concn. applicable in FCS, using a conventional optical setup. At such high countrates the FCS curves need to be cor. for dead-time of the photo-detector, which was done successfully. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescence {{correlation}} spectroscopy (FCS) {{is becoming increasingly}} popular as a technique that aims at complementing live cell images with biophysical information. This article provides both a short overview over recent intracellular FCS applications and a practical guide for investigators, who are seeking to integrate FCS into live cell imaging to obtain information on particle mobility, local concentrations, and molecular interactions. A brief introduction {{to the principles of}} FCS is provided, particularly emphasizing practical aspects such as the choice of appropriate dyes and positioning of the measurement volume in the sample. Possibilities and limitations in extracting parameters from <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>curves</b> are discussed, and attention is drawn to potential artifacts, such as photobleaching and probe aggregation. The principle of dual- color cross-correlation is reviewed along with considerations for proper setup and adjustment. Practical implications of nonideal conditions including incomplete focus overlap and spectral crosstalk are considered. Recent examples of both auto- and cross-correlation applications demonstrate the potential of FCS for cell biology. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{software}} AGE (Analysis of Gene Evolution) {{has been}} developed both to study a genetic reality, i. e. the identification of statistical properties in genes (e. g. periodicities), and to simulate this observed genetic reality, by models of molecular evolution. AGE has two types of models: (i) models of sequence creation from oligonucleotides: concatenation model in series of an oligonucleotide, independent (or Markov) mixing model of oligonucleotides according to given probabilities (or a Markov matrix); (ii) models of sequence evolution from created sequences: insertion/deletion process of (mono, di, tri) nucleot-ides, base mutation process. The study of a reality {{and the development of}} simulation models are based on several new algorithms: approximated simulation and exact calculus to compute various autocorrelation functions, Fourier transformation of <b>autocorrelation</b> <b>curves,</b> recognition of a curve form, etc. AGE is implemented on IBM or compatible microcomputers and can be used by biologists without any computer knowledge to identify statistical properties in their newly determined DNA sequence and to explain them by models of molecular evolutio...|$|R
