5|$|Following the All-Star game, Wade {{recorded}} 50 {{points on}} 56.6% shooting and added 5 rebounds and 5 assists in a blow-out loss against the Orlando Magic. Wade became the fourth player in NBA history to score at least 50 points while his team lost {{by at least}} 20 in a game. The following game, Wade recorded a career-high 16 assists and added 31 points and 7 rebounds in a 103–91 win against the Detroit Pistons. Wade became the second player to record 15 or more assists after scoring at least 50 points since Wilt Chamberlain did so in 1968. Two games later, Wade tied a franchise record with 24 points in the fourth quarter, as he led the Heat back from a 15-point deficit in the final nine minutes of the quarter to secure a 120–115 win over the New York Knicks. For the game, Wade recorded 46 points on 55% field goal shooting, 10 assists, 8 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks. Wade followed the performance with a second consecutive 40-point game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Playing against his Eastern Conference rival and good friend, LeBron James, Wade registered 41 points on 53% shooting, 9 assists, 7 steals, 7 rebounds and one block as the Heat lost 107–100. The following game, in former teammate Shaquille O'Neal's return to Miami since being traded, Wade tied a career-high with 16 assists and added 35 points on 62% shooting, 6 rebounds, a steal and a block, as the Heat defeated the Phoenix Suns 135–129. Wade became the only player in Heat history to have multiple games with at least 30 points and 15 assists. Less than a week later, Wade tied his franchise record with his 78th consecutive game of scoring in double figures in a double overtime thriller against the Chicago Bulls, in which he scored the game-winning three-point basket to secure a 130–127 win. Wade finished with 48 points on 71.4% shooting, 12 assists, 6 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks in 50 minutes. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Wade joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only other player in NBA history to score that many points <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> many assists in a game, while having as high of a field goal percentage. Two games later, Wade surpassed Alonzo Mourning and became the Heat's all-time leading scorer in a triple overtime classic against the Utah Jazz. Wade finished with 50 points, 10 rebounds, 9 assists, 4 steals, and 2 blocks in a 140–129 win.|$|E

500|$|After his conviction, Chandler {{was named}} by media {{as one of}} Florida's most notorious criminals.

500|$|ABC was {{concerned}} about the content of the episode, arguing that the idea that the story could be all in Hurley's head was offering an explanation for the show as a whole, since a recurring theory among the fandom was that the events of the series were hallucinations. The character of Dave {{was meant to be a}} side of Hurley who felt he had no problem, and encourages Hurley to overeat, and is played by Evan Handler in a way director Jack Bender described as [...] "mischievous, impish-like". Showrunner Carlton Cuse revealed his name comes from Hurley's father, David Reyes - who would later appear in the series played by Cheech Marin - because the writers [...] "wanted Hurley to imagine a friend <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> be wrapped up in his unresolved relationship with his dad". The final scene with Libby was so secret that only Jack Bender and his assistant director had it in their scripts, and to prevent Libby from being the only woman in the mental institution, every woman on the set, including Bender's daughter Sophie, was dressed in robes and pajamas to appear as background characters.|$|E
500|$|Likewise George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of the Contra Costa Times {{praised the}} {{on-screen}} return of characters such as Mulder and Krycek. They felt so many eighth-season episodes worked well because [...] "Chris Carter {{seems to be}} taking an even more active role in the series that is most closely identified with him." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and wrote that, [...] "it’s a measure of a show’s effectiveness to see how convincingly the writers can threaten a major character, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> character’s subsequent survival not be a cheat", in regards to Mulder's resurrection. He applauded the fact that the episode is suspenseful, even though the ending has a certain inevitability. Handlen also positively commented on both Anderson's performance—although pointing out that she [...] "is largely pushed to the side for the majority" [...] of the episode—and Lea's reappearance, noting that [...] "it's always fun to see Krycek". However, he argued that the conclusion [...] "makes less sense the more you think about it", but that the final scene with Mulder and Scully [...] "makes up for the contrivance." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode, {{like the}} others in the series, was shot over eight days, with the 'May vs. May' fight being shot over three of those days—one 16-hour day, a half-day, and a quarter-day. In {{preparation}} for the fight, both Wen and her stunt double Samantha Jo had to learn both May and Agent 33's actions, with Jo explaining that [...] "Usually you only have to learn one side, so you can just drill that into your head <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> muscle memory and be good to go. But for this fight, for both Ming and myself, we had to learn both sides of the fight. And we knew on the day we were filming that we’d have to be changing our wardrobe back and forth. So we’d be going {{to one side of the}} fight, to the other side of the fight, back to the other side, and we just wanted to make sure we were safe about it. Because if we spaced out and started doing the other side again, we didn’t want anyone to get hurt. So that’s why we trained together. We were doing two sessions twice a week, anywhere from two to five hours at Ming’s house just trying to get as physically ready and as mentally ready as possible. But thankfully, we’d already done so many episodes together by that point that we were super comfortable, and we know each other’s body movements." ...|$|E

2500|$|Red Hat kernel {{developer}} Ingo Molnar {{released a}} Linux kernel patch named Exec Shield to approximate and utilize NX functionality on 32-bit x86 CPUs.The Exec Shield patch was {{released to the}} Linux kernel mailing list on May 2, 2003, but was rejected for merging with the base kernel because it involved some intrusive changes to core code in order to handle the complex parts of the emulation. Exec Shield's legacy CPU support approximates NX emulation by tracking the upper code segment limit. This imposes only a few cycles of overhead during context switches, which is {{for all intents and}} purposes immeasurable. For legacy CPUs without an NX bit, Exec Shield fails to protect pages below the code segment limit; an mprotect (...) call to mark higher memory, such as the stack, executable will mark all memory below that limit executable as well. Thus, in these situations, Exec Shield's schemes fails. This is the cost of Exec Shield's low overhead. Exec Shield checks for two ELF header markings, which dictate whether the stack or heap needs to be executable. These are called PT_GNU_STACK and PT_GNU_HEAP respectively. Exec Shield allows these controls to be set for both binary executables and for libraries; if an executable loads a library requiring a given restriction relaxed, the executable will inherit that marking <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> restriction relaxed.|$|E

2500|$|Whatever David {{thought of}} his {{childhood}} homeland, the Anglo-Norman historians were clearly convinced that he had little cultural or social connection to it in 1124. David remained an absentee king {{for much of his}} early reign in Scotland-proper. In his first act as king he made a grant or perhaps a reaffirmation of a previous grant to one of his followers, Robert de Brus, of the lordship of Annandale, on the frontier between his old principality and the lands of [...] "Galloway":"David, by the grace of God King of Scots, to all his barons, men and friends, English and French, greetings. Know you that I have given and granted to Robert de Brus Ystrad Annan (Annandale) and all the land from the boundary of Dunegal of Srath Nid (Nithsdale) to the boundary of Randolph le Meschin; and I will and grant that he should hold <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> land and its castle well and honourably with all its customs which Ranulph le Meschin ever had in Carduill (Carlisle) and in his land of Cumberland on that day in which he had them most fully and freely.

[...] This charter addresses only his [...] "English and French" [...] followers, and the witness list contains the names of eight Frenchmen and one Englishman; there are no Scots. By contrast, the witnesses to the charters of Alexander I issued in Scotland-proper are virtually all Gaels. In 1124 then, it is possible to argue that David felt he could depend on Frenchmen and Englishmen only. It would take some time for David to reestablish himself in the country and people of his early childhood.|$|E
