2500|$|Lucky and Luke start a {{slow process}} of {{reconciling}} when Luke kidnaps Lucky to an abandoned cabin and Lucky watches Luke distressfully dream of the rape while suffering from a delirious fever following a wolf trap accident. Lucky's relationship with his mother becomes further strained in December 1998 when he and Nikolas are told that Stefan Cassadine (Nichols) is Nikolas's father, not the presumed-dead Stavros Cassadine, and Laura had kept the secret. Lucky and Nikolas begin to bond over the betrayal of their respective families. Lucky's estrangement with his parents adds to his newfound open-mindedness about Nikolas, as Jackson told Soap Opera Magazine: [...] "Lucky's been {{trying to change the}} way he looks at things, to not become Luke. That's part of the process – not having the same relationship with Nikolas that Luke has with Stefan. (...) He's trying to find his own Spencer." [...] The former enemies become friends, a sign of Lucky's growth of character. Actress Genie Francis (Laura) explained to Soap Opera Digest in April 1999: [...] "It's huge, absolutely huge. (It's) something that really seemed impossible, but Lucky surprises [...] with his big heart and his maturity." [...] In the same interview, Guza described the acceptance Lucky had come to have about his parents, recounting scenes where Lucky bonds with each. Guza explained: [...] "They still have <b>a</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> {{but the important thing is}} they're making the inroads now. (...) I wouldn't say it's the final resolution between them, but they're well on their way toward it." ...|$|E

5000|$|The album {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. Andy Kellman of Allmusic said, [...] "Holiday instead delivers a second album {{that is not}} a retread. Its not a reinvention, either, but the roster of collaborators is almost completely different, and Holiday all but eliminates the tough guy and stoner talk". Mark Edward Nero of About.com said Round 2 is a well-sung, well-written, well-produced album, but the one negative is that its a little bland and leans too much on love songs. Slavik Nathan of DJBooth.net stated Round 2 finds Holiday shifting away from Lac’s harder-edged image in favor of a smoother sound, resulting in a well-crafted album that shows that while Holiday’s got <b>a</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> before he reaches elite status, no one {{will ever be able to}} call him a one-hit wonder again.|$|E

Michigan scored three touchdowns in the second half and led 25-0 in the fourth quarter before Notre Dame scored.

50|$|Currently, {{there are}} no {{programs}} encouraging reduced fossil fuel use. Although the government provides subsidies for oil consumption, record breaking oil use has pushed policy towards renewable energy. Peak load, where high energy use creates power outages, is a common fear among the citizens of Saudi Arabia. This anxiety creates further urgency for alternate energy plans to support the population. Mass oil consumption is not sustainable. This realization recently created a new market for renewable energies and further research for cleaner initiatives. Scholars are developing plans to transition Saudi Arabia to renewable energy.As opposed to overall energy reduction, the government organization Saudi Aramco wishes to create a solar energy sector.
