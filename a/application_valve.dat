In addition to the static and dynamic load and response time required for the valve, the actuator must withstand the temperature range, corrosion environment and other conditions of a specific <b>application.</b> <b>Valve</b> actuator applications are often safety related, therefore the plant operators put high demands on {{the reliability of the}} devices. Failure of an actuator may cause accidents in process-controlled plants and toxic substances may leak into the environment.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{majority}} of patients with cardiomyopathy are {{in the category of}} primary or idiopathic cardiomyopathy, for which therapy is symptomatic and non-specific, {{there are a number of}} secondary forms of cardiomyopathy for which specific therapy is available, thus giving impetus to prompt and accurate diagnosis. Among inflammatory lesions, brucellosis, psittacosis and toxoplasmosis are examples. Treatable metabolic causes include thyrotoxicosis and thiamine deficiency, the latter as well as calorie-protein malnutrition are also preventable. There is presumptive evidence that the cardiomyopathy of haemochromatosis is benefited by repeated phlebotomies. Symptomatic relief of obstructive cardiomyopathy is achieved by beta-adrenergic blockade, although resection of obstructing myocardium still has a place. The therapeutic approach to the vast majority of cases of congestive cardiomyopathy is non-specific, comprising controlled activity, sodium restriction, digitalis and diuretics. Vasodilators and, occasionally, beta-adrenergic blockade may be beneficial. Pacemakers may be life-saving, whereas the place of anti-arrhythmics remains uncertain. Transplantation warrants further <b>application.</b> <b>Valve</b> replacement has little to offer. Primary prevention, comprising balanced nutrition, vaccines and genetic counselling, merits wider application. In individuals at risk or already afflicted, programmes of secondary prevention should include good nutrition, abstinence from alcohol and protection from drugs and toxins...|$|E

5000|$|Short {{operational}} life. In {{the most}} common <b>applications,</b> <b>valves</b> have a working life {{of just a few}} thousand hours, much shorter than solid state parts. This is due various commonplace failure mechanisms: cathode depletion, open or shorts circuitsâ€”notably of the heater and grid structures, cathode poisoning, and physical breakage of the glass envelope. Heater failure most often happens due to the mechanical stress of a cold start. Only, in certain always-on professional applications such as specialized computing and undersea cables, specially designed valves in carefully designed circuits and well cooled environments reached operational lives of tens or hundreds of thousands of hours.|$|R
2500|$|Vacuum-tube {{amplifiers}} (also {{known as}} tube amplifiers or valve amplifiers) use a vacuum tube as the active device. While semiconductor amplifiers have largely displaced valve amplifiers for low-power <b>applications,</b> <b>valve</b> amplifiers {{can be much}} more cost effective in high power applications such as radar, countermeasures equipment, and communications equipment. Many microwave amplifiers are specially designed valve amplifiers, such as the klystron, gyrotron, traveling wave tube, and crossed-field amplifier, and these microwave valves provide much greater single-device power output at microwave frequencies than solid-state devices. Vacuum tubes remain in use in some high end audio equipment, {{as well as in}} musical instrument amplifiers, due to a preference for [...] "tube sound".|$|R

50|$|A {{choke valve}} is {{sometimes}} {{installed in the}} carburetor of internal combustion engines.

5000|$|...Their {{application}} {{is restricted to}} smaller compressors where efficiency and uptime are not critical. In 2009, the Modular Reed Valve (MRV) technology was developed for compressors. The MRV has a flow path similar to reed valves used in two-stroke engines, but with design elements to handle the higher differential pressures seen in typical compressor applications. MRVs are drop in replacement reed valves for industrial reciprocating compressors, for speeds from 350 rpm to over 3600 rpm, pressure differential to 3500 psi (241 bar) across a <b>valve,</b> continuous <b>application</b> temperatures from -40 to 550 F (-40 C to 288 C), and for most gases including highly corrosive gases such as sour gas, ammonia, chlorine and acid gas [...] Modular Reed Valves have been deployed for larger compressors in critical <b>applications.</b> <b>Valves</b> based on the MRV design such as the Straightflo valve, have been deployed in natural gas gathering, gas transmission, CO2 and gas injection, propane, air and CO2 applications. MRV has also been used in research involving repurposing automobile engines for compressed natural gas.|$|R
