40|$|Data {{concerning}} {{the properties of}} commercial jet fuels during the period between 1974 and 1979 are discussed. During this period the average <b>aromatics</b> <b>content</b> of fuels increased from 16 % to 17. 5 %. It is evident that the arrival of Alaska North Slope crude in 1977 {{had a significant impact}} upon the <b>aromatics</b> <b>content</b> of jet fuel supply at West Coast points with less effect upon the entire United States domestic market. This increase in aromatics has not been accompanied by a corresponding reduction in burning quality as measured by smoke point. There has been a reduction of. 6 smoke point on the average. Looking at hydrogen content as a measure of burning quality, the all refinery average calculated hydrogen for 1978 was approximately 13. 7 %.

40|$|This work {{describes}} a methodology for predicting basic nitrogen and <b>aromatics</b> <b>contents</b> in crude oil, using positive ion mode laser desorption ionization coupled to Fourier transform {{ion cyclotron resonance}} mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) and partial least squares (PLS) regression with variable selection based on competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), in a procedure called CARSPLS regression. The basic nitrogen and <b>aromatics</b> <b>contents</b> were determined using UOP Method 269 - 10 and ASTM D 5443 - 14, respectively, for 70 samples of Brazilian crude oil. The basic nitrogen values ranged from 0. 016 % to 0. 151 % and the aromatics values from 8. 4 % to 35. 1 %. The LDI(+) -FT-ICR mass spectra of crude oil samples have profiles that ranged from m/z 200 to 1000, with an average molar mass distribution (M-w) centered between 554 and 636 Da. Most of the identified organic species are analogues of pyridine and polyaromatic hydrocarbon compounds that belong in the N-x, N-x[H], HC, and HC[H] classes. Additionally, the number of detected N-x species increases systematically with increasing basic nitrogen and <b>aromatics</b> <b>content.</b> The CARS method was used to select the most informative variables for the PLS calibration model, thereby {{reducing the number of}} variables from 47, 873 to 48 and 10 for basic nitrogen and aromatic compounds, respectively. The prediction model based on CARSPLS presented RMSEP of 0. 012 and 3. 73 wt% for basic nitrogen and <b>aromatics</b> <b>contents,</b> respectively. In addition, it was possible to verify that the accuracy of CARSPLS is ever better than only using PLS regression (with all variables). The application of CARSPLS algorithm is therefore justified by easier interpretation of the FT-ICR MS data after variables reduction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{commercial}} {{jet fuels}} usually contain about 40 % aromatics and naphthene. However, conventional technologies on bio-jet fuels production by hydrodeoxygenation of plant oil and biomass gasification/Fischer-Tropsch synthesis can't produce renewable aromatics. In this paper, the liquid fuels with high <b>aromatics</b> <b>content</b> were produced by aqueous phase catalytic conversion of biomass sugar/polyol over Ni@HZSM- 5 /MCM- 41 catalysts. Liquid fuel yield of 32 wt% with <b>aromatics</b> <b>content</b> of 84. 3 % was obtained under {{the conditions of}} 300 degrees C, WHSV of 1. 25 h(- 1), GHSV of 2500 h(- 1) and 4. 0 MPa of hydrogen pressure with mixed polyol (60 % sorbitol + 40 % xylitol) as feedstocks. The produced bio-aromatics are substituted benzenes, naphthalenes, and aromatic olefins, which is a wonderful crude oil {{to be used as}} jet fuels after it was hydrogenated to improve quality (deep deoxygenation/chemical bond saturation).

5000|$|Petroleum benzine is a {{hydrocarbon}} based solvent mixture that {{is classified}} by its physical properties (e.g. boiling point, vapor pressure) {{rather than a}} specific chemical composition, often obfuscating distinction within {{the long list of}} petroleum distillate solvent mixtures: mineral spirits, naphtha, white spirits, petroleum spirits, turps substitute, mineral turpentine, petroleum benzine, petroleum ether, ligroin, and Stoddard Solvent. The chemical composition of a petroleum distillate can also be modified to afford a solvent with reduced concentration of unsaturated hydrocarbons, i.e. alkenes, by hydrotreating and/or reduced aromatics, e.g. benzene, toluene xylene, by several dearomatization methods. In a document that attempts to draw more concise distinctions between hydrocarbon solvents, conservator Alan Phenix explains that the most important distinction amongst the various hydrocarbon solvents are their boiling/distillation ranges (and, by association, volatility, flash point etc.) and <b>aromatic</b> <b>content.</b> Given the toxicity/carcinogenicity of some aromatic hydrocarbons, most notably benzene, the <b>aromatic</b> <b>content</b> of petroleum distillate solvents, which would normally be in the 10-25% (w/w) range for most petroleum fractions, can be advantageously reduced when their special solvation properties are not required and a less odorous, lower toxicity solvent is desired, especially when present in consumer products. Phenix further points out that [...] "To all intents and purposes petroleum benzine appears synonymous with petroleum spirit." [...] Petroleum spirit is generally considered to be the fractions between the very lightest hydrocarbons, petroleum ether, and the heavier distillates, mineral spirits. For example, petroleum benzine with a boiling range of 36 - 83 °C sold by EMD Millipore under CAS-No. 64742-49-0 is identified in the product MSDS as hydrotreated light petroleum distillates comprising ≥ 90% C5-C7 hydrocarbons, n-alkanes, isoalkanes, and < 5% n-hexane, while Santa Cruz Biotechnology sells a petroleum ether product under the same CAS-No. Fisher Scientific offers a product ‘Benzine (Petroleum Naphtha)' that retails for a high price that would suggest it is a speciality product but in fact conforms to Marathon Petroleum's 'VM&P Naphtha' (Varnish Makers & Painters’ Naphtha) found widely distributed in many hardware stores in North America.|$|E

In 1940 an improved fuel, designated [...] "C-2" [...] was introduced having a higher <b>aromatic</b> <b>content</b> of 35-38% and giving performance equivalent to Allied 100 octane grade of that time. C-2 was used in small quantities by aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109E-4/N and E-7/N and the Messerschmitt Bf 110C when equipped with the DB 601N engine, that entered series production in October 1939. The power was increased by 20% over that of the DB 601A, to 1,260 hp at 6,900 feet (2,100 m) at 1.35 atm boost pressure and 2,400 rpm. By July, nine Bf 110 and three Bf 109 fighter Staffeln (squadrons) were equipped with the new engines, By the end of October around 1,200 DB 601N engines had been delivered. and the number of aircraft equipped with the improved engine gradually increased through the second half of the year. However, due to leaking valves there was relatively high wear on the 601N-engines, which had a life of about 40 hours.|$|E
5000|$|Nitrile rubber (NBR, HNBR, HSN): {{a common}} {{material}} for o-rings {{because of its}} good mechanical properties, its resistance to lubricants and greases, and its relatively low cost. The physical and chemical resistance properties of NBR materials {{are determined by the}} acrylonitrile (ACN) content of the base polymer: low content ensures good flexibility at low temperatures, but offers limited resistance to oils and fuels. As the ACN content increases, the low temperature flexibility reduces and the resistance to oils and fuels improves. Physical and chemical resistance properties of NBR materials are also affected by the cure system of the polymer. Peroxide-cured materials have improved physical properties, chemical resistance and thermal properties, as compared to sulfur-donor-cured materials. Standard grades of NBR are typically resistant to mineral oil-based lubricants and greases, many grades of hydraulic fluids, aliphatic hydrocarbons, silicone oils and greases and water to about 80 °C. NBR is generally not resistant to aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbons, fuels with a high <b>aromatic</b> <b>content,</b> polar solvents, glycol-based brake fluids and non-flammable hydraulic fluids (HFD). NBR also has low resistance to ozone, weathering and aging. HNBR has considerable improvement of the resistance to heat, ozone and aging, and gives it good mechanical properties.|$|E

H protein (or the DNA Pilot Protein) pilots the viral genome through the bacterial membrane of E.coli bacteria (Jazwinski et al. 1975) most likely via a predicted N-terminal transmembrane domain helix (Tusnady and Simon, 2001). However, {{it has become}} apparent that H protein is a multifunctional protein (Cherwa, Young and Fane, 2011). This is the only viral capsid protein of ΦX174 to lack a crystal structure {{for a couple of}} reasons. It has low <b>aromatic</b> <b>content</b> and high glycine content, making the protein structure very flexible and in addition, individual hydrogen atoms (the R group for glycines) are difficult to detect in protein crystallography. Additionally, H protein induces lysis of the bacterial host at high concentrations as the predicted N-terminal transmembrane helix easily pokes holes through the bacterial wall. By bioinformatics, this protein contains four predicted coiled-coil domains which has a significant homology to known transcription factors. Additionally, it was determined by Ruboyianes et al. (2009) that de novo H protein was required for optimal synthesis of other viral proteins. Interestingly, mutations in H protein that prevent viral incorporation, can be overcome when excess amounts of Protein B, the internal scaffolding protein, are supplied.|$|E

The results showed that for CNPC to upgrade its gasoline, the share of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) naphtha must be reduced, but just increasing reformate or alkylate and isomerate will result in excessive increase in benzene and <b>aromatics</b> <b>contents</b> or a great loss of gasoline octane number. Therefore, CNPC should suitably control the capacity of its FCC units and increase the capacity of reformer, alkylation and isomerization units. Most importantly, CNPC should dramatically expand the capacity of its hydrotreating or non-hydrotreating gasoline upgrading units to decrease the olefin and sulfur contents in FCC gasoline that takes a dominant share of about 80 % in the gasoline pool of China.|$|R
