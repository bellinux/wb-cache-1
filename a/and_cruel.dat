5|$|According {{to popular}} tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was {{lord of the}} manor in the mid-14thcentury and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular <b>and</b> <b>cruel</b> feudal lord. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being torn apart and thrown into the crowd. The first {{recorded}} occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.|$|E

He returned to his beloved Newcastle {{as soon as he}} could, but his time in the capital gave him a wider reputation, business experience, and an awareness of new movements in art.|$|E

5|$|The disdain of the British {{people for}} the Boers was {{recorded}} {{as early as the}} 18th century. The Boers were portrayed to the British public in literature and editorial cartoons as uncivilised <b>and</b> <b>cruel,</b> especially in order to obtain the support of the British public for British imperialism and the Second Boer War. The English term Boer-hater was used in a political context in the British Cape Colony as early as 1889, referring to persons opposing Cape Dutch interests, the use of their language in Parliament in particular.|$|E
5|$|The hymn 10.92 of the Rigveda {{states that}} deity Rudra has two natures, one wild <b>and</b> <b>cruel</b> (rudra), another that is kind and {{tranquil}} (shiva). The Vedic texts do not mention bull or any animal as the transport vehicle (vahana) of Rudra or other deities. However, post-Vedic texts {{such as the}} Mahabharata and the Puranas state the Nandi bull, the Indian zebu, in particular, as the vehicle of Rudra and of Shiva, thereby unmistakably linking them as same.|$|E

5|$|Caracalla is {{presented}} in ancient sources as a tyrant <b>and</b> <b>cruel</b> leader, an image that has survived into modernity. Dio Cassius and Herodian present Caracalla as a soldier first and emperor second. In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth started the legend of Caracalla's role as the king of Britain. Later, in the 18th century, Caracalla's memory was revived {{in the works of}} French artists due to the parallels between Caracalla's apparent tyranny and that of King Louis XVI. Modern works continue to portray Caracalla as a psychopathic and evil ruler. His rule is remembered as being one of the most tyrannical of all Roman emperors.|$|E

His {{sale of the}} casts were not successful, and at a low financial and personal ebb he asked that {{for one of the}} reproductions to act as a marker for his grave. A cast was not placed there until 1973. There are only three other surviving comments of his on the figure: on an 1895 presentation mount of two impressions of a woodcut of the Oviri figure he made to Stéphane Mallarmé where he called the figure a strange <b>and</b> <b>cruel</b> enigma; in an 1897 letter to Ambroise Vollard where he referred to it as La Tueuse ("The Murderess"); and in a c. 1899 drawing where he appends an inscription referencing Honoré de Balzac's novel Séraphîta. Oviri was exhibited at the 1906 Salon d'Automne (no.57) where it influenced Pablo Picasso, who based one of the figures in Les Demoiselles d'Avignon on it.|$|E

5|$|In 538/539, Artabanes, at {{the time}} {{apparently}} still a young man, {{took part in the}} Armenian conspiracy against Acacius, the proconsul of First Armenia, whose heavy taxes <b>and</b> <b>cruel</b> behaviour was greatly resented. Artabanes himself killed Acacius. Shortly after, in a skirmish between the rebels and the Byzantine army at Oenochalacon, Artabanes may have killed the Byzantine general Sittas, sent by Justinian to quell the rebellion (Procopius supplies two accounts, one attributing Sittas's death to Artabanes and another to an otherwise unknown Armenian named Solomon). Artabanes's father tried to negotiate a settlement with Sittas' successor, Bouzes, but was murdered by the latter. This act forced Artabanes and his followers to seek the aid of the Sassanid Persian ruler, Khosrau I (r. 531–579). Crossing over to Persian territory, {{over the next few years}} Artabanes and those who followed him took part in Khosrau's campaigns against the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|The main {{goals of}} the terror was to destroy the power {{structure}} of the enemy, clear and secure the areas governed and occupied by the armies. Another goal was to create shock and fear among the civil population and the enemy soldiers. In the Finnish case, the common troopers' paramilitary nature and lack of combat skills, led to use political violence as a military weapon. The terror achieved some of the objectives, but also gave additional motivation to fight against an enemy perceived to be inhuman <b>and</b> <b>cruel.</b> The Red and White propaganda utilized the acts of the opponent effectively, which increased the local killings and the spiral of revenge.|$|E

The Federation was inaugurated in 2439 following a coup deposing the last Terran Emperor Dramon Salaria in 2437 and was established to encourage commercial competition rather than full-scale wars between its constituent parties. The authority of the Federation is constantly challenged — in part by those who helped to create it, and the further away from the Federal center a person is, the less the Federation can influence their day-to-day lives. The seventh alien culture — the Mauna are not members of the Federation and it is revealed in the game that they are an untrustworthy <b>and</b> <b>cruel</b> species.

5|$|Having {{vowed to}} end Delilah's {{experiments}} with the dead, Cain solves murders while periodically running into Jizabel {{and other members}} of Delilah. After encountering Mikaila, who professes her one-sided love for him and wants to become Suzette, he becomes obsessed with destroying the organization and learns that it is secretly building a memorial temple. Meanwhile, despite Jizabel's efforts to delay Riff's second, hidden, <b>and</b> <b>cruel</b> personality from awakening, the hypnosis suppressing it breaks. Riff later declares to Cain that he secretly works for Delilah: the loyal, kind-hearted Riff Cain had known is an alternative personality used to deceive others. Alexis had intended for Cain to develop a close bond with Riff, only to break it, to remind Cain that he is unloved. After Riff's departure, Cain resolves to confront Alexis and promises Mary that they will have a tea party after the conflict with Delilah ends. Led by Cassian, whose brain has been transplanted into an adult body, he reaches the tower within the temple where Alexis plans to sacrifice the brainwashed people of London to revive Augusta. Within the tower, Riff reveals his intent to overthrow Alexis. Unconcerned, Alexis divulges that Riff is Delilah's longest surviving doll and will soon die. Riff attacks Cain, but Riff's other personality resurfaces, causing him to deliberately shoot himself. Riff's loyal personality triumphs over the cruel one, but he and Cain are separated. Because Riff's wound cannot heal, Jizabel commits suicide so Riff can use his blood to briefly remain alive and return to Cain. Meanwhile, Cain successfully poisons his father and with his death, the tower begins to crumble. Cain, unable to escape and hurt by the falling debris, reunites briefly with Riff. However, the ceiling collapses and Riff tries to push him away. Cain embraces him, choosing to stay.|$|E
