50|$|<b>Asimadoline</b> (EMD-61753) {{is a drug}} {{which acts}} as a {{peripherally}} selective κ-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist. Because of its poor ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, <b>asimadoline</b> lacks the psychotomimetic effects of centrally acting KOR agonists, and consequently has more potential for medical use, and has been researched as a possible treatment for irritable bowel syndrome, with reasonable efficacy seen in clinical trials.|$|E
5000|$|Eluxadoline is a {{peripherally}} restricted KOR agonist {{as well as}} MOR agonist and DOR antagonist {{that has}} been approved {{for the treatment of}} diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. <b>Asimadoline</b> and fedotozine are selective and similarly peripherally restricted KOR agonists that were also investigated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and reportedly demonstrated at least some efficacy for this indication but were ultimately never marketed.|$|E
40|$|Opioids, though {{widely used}} as analgesics, {{have not been}} seriously {{considered}} as therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. The present study evaluated the dose-effect and time-dependence relationships of a new peripherally selective κ agonist, <b>asimadoline,</b> in rats with adjuvant arthritis. The arthritis was assessed by a pooled severity index combining the comprehensive criteria of oedema, radiography and histological changes, in the hind limbs. <b>Asimadoline</b> was extremely effective in attenuating joint damage (by up to 80 %) when administered parenterally (0. 5 to 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 [*]day− 1, i. p.) throughout the disease or during its early phase; treatment was less successful if confined to the latter stages. Ten fold higher doses were effective orally. Equimolar doses of a peripherally-selective antagonist, naloxone methiodide, and the κ-selective antagonist, MR 2266, fully reversed the peripheral anti-arthritic effects of <b>asimadoline</b> (5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 [*]day− 1), indicating that <b>asimadoline</b> acts through peripheral κ-opioid receptors. However, an equivalent dose of MR 2266 did not fully reverse the anti-arthritic effects of the highest dose of <b>asimadoline</b> (40 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 [*]day− 1), suggesting a loss of κ-selectivity at this dose. <b>Asimadoline</b> also exhibited analgesic effects (mechanical nociceptive thresholds) in arthritic but not non-arthritic rats, indicating that inflammation is necessary for asimadoline-induced analgesia. These data confirm our previous findings that κ-opioids possess anti-arthritic properties and that these effects are mediated via peripheral κ-receptors. The present results are new in showing that the peripherally acting κ-opioid agonist, <b>asimadoline,</b> is a potent anti-arthritic agent. Such novel drugs, essentially lacking central side effects, herald new treatments for rheumatoid arthritis...|$|E

40|$|Studies with {{knockout}} mice lacking mdr 1 a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) {{have previously}} shown that blood-brain barrier P-gp {{is important in}} preventing the accumulation of several drugs in the brain. <b>Asimadoline</b> (EMD 61753) is a peripherally selective κ-opioid receptor agonist which is under development as a therapeutic analgaesic. From the structural characteristics of this drug and its peripheral selectivity, we hypothesized that it is transported by P-gp. Using a pig-kidney polarized epithelial cell line transfected with mdr cDNAs, we demonstrate that <b>asimadoline</b> is transported by the mouse mdr 1 a P-gp and the human MDR 1 P-gp. Furthermore, we show that in mdr 1 a/ 1 b double knockout mice, the absence of P-gp leads to a 9 fold increased accumulation of <b>asimadoline</b> in the brain. In line with this accumulation difference, mdr 1 a/ 1 b (−/−) mice are at least 8 fold {{more sensitive to the}} sedative effect of <b>asimadoline</b> than wild-type mice. Interestingly, the oral uptake of <b>asimadoline</b> was not substantially altered in mdr 1 a/ 1 b (−/−) mice. Our results demonstrate that for some drugs, P-gp in the blood-brain barrier can have a therapeutically beneficial effect by limiting brain penetration, whereas at the same time intestinal P-gp is not a significant impediment to oral uptake of the drug...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effects of EMD 61753 (<b>asimadoline),</b> a k-opioid receptor agonist with restricted access to the central nervous system, on postoper-ative pain in patients who underwent knee surgery and on nociceptive thresholds and inflammation in rats treated with Freund’s complete adjuvant. Patients treated with EMD 61753 (10 mg p. o.) tended to report an increase in pain, as evaluated by a visual analog scale and by the time to the first request for and the total amount of supplemental analgesic medication. The global tolerability of EMD 61753 was assessed as signifi-cantly inferior to that of a placebo by the investigator. In rats, the bilateral intraplantar (i. pl.) injection of EMD 61753 (0. 1 – 3. 2 mg) resulted in dose-dependent antinociception in both in-flamed and noninflamed paws, with a peak at 5 min afte...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of psoriatic itch {{is poorly}} understood. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the involvement of opioid receptors in scratching behaviour of imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis model mice. Topical application of 5 % imiquimod cream to the rostral back skin of mice induced antihistamine-resistant scratching behaviour. The expression of µ-opioid receptor (MOR) protein increased in the epidermis, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord of imiquimod-treated mice. In contrast, the expression of κ-opioid receptor (KOR) protein decreased in the DRG and spinal cord of imiquimod-treated mice, and was undetectable in the epidermis of both groups. Topical or intraperitoneal administration of the MOR antagonist naloxone and oral administration of the centrally acting KOR agonist ICI- 199, 441 inhibited scratching behaviour, whereas oral administration of the peri­pherally-selective KOR agonist <b>asimadoline</b> did not. These results suggest that peripheral and central MOR and central KOR may be involved in the modulation of scratching behaviour in imiquimod-treated mice...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Current {{approaches}} to treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) aim to normalise disturbed intestinal physiology. The most effective centrally acting drugs are tricyclic antidepressants. Alosetron, a 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist {{is effective in}} women with diarrhea-predominant IBS whilst tegaserod and prucalopride are 5 -HT 4 agonists enhancing bowel motility in constipation-predominant IBS. Serotonergic receptor modulation has been the first targeted pharmacological intervention. The development of new drugs constitutes a major challenge as there are many targets along the brain-gut axis and the enteric nervous system (ENS). Newer tricyclic antidepressants with fewer side effects and corticotrophin releasing factor- 1 (CRF- 1) antagonists are examples of future centrally acting drugs. Agents that alter visceral sensitivity include kappa-opioid agonists (fedotozine, trimebutine, <b>asimadoline),</b> alpha- 2 adrenoreceptor agonists (clonidine, lidamidine), tachykinin receptor antagonists (neurokinin A, substance P) and other experimental anti-nociceptive drugs (GABA-B receptor agonists). COX- 2 inhibitors may be effective for postinfectious IBS. Drugs potentially useful in controlling intestinal motility and secretion other than serotonergic receptors modulators, include muscarinic receptors antagonists (derifenacin, zamenifenacin), octreotide and CCK- 1 receptor antagonists (dexloglumide). Neurotrophins (NT- 3 and brain derived neurotrophic factor) are promising factors {{for the treatment of}} IBS patients with constipation. The development of new and effective drugs for IBS requires a more detailed understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms, a fact that will allow us a more targeted intervention.
