5|$|During the Battle of Malvern Hill on 1 July 1862, Brandon's {{ankle joint}} {{was struck by}} a ball. As he fell, his hand hit a rolling shell which did not explode. Oblivious to his wounds, Brandon tried to rise again but he fell once more and {{remained}} on the field until men were able to pick him up and carry him to the rear. Because there was no visible bleeding, Brandon thought that his injuries were not serious but was taken on horse-back to a hospital. Initially, Brandon was offered whiskey which would have eased the pain, but he refused to drink it without water and sugar. He drank it only after being convinced it was necessary. Brandon's foot was removed after a torniquet was put in place. Brandon's arteries were then sewn in what was likely to be <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>painful</b> procedure, as there was not enough choloroform to produce a full anesthesia. To replace his amputated leg, his doctors gave him a wooden prosthetic leg. Because of Brandon's age, his doctors thought his chances of survival were slight. After coming to Richmond, he was tended to by friends and his servant. Confederate President Jefferson Davis even offered Brandon the hospitality of his mansion in the city.|$|E

25|$|One {{possibly}} serious, but rare, {{side effect}} with vardenafil is heart attack. Also, in rare cases, vardenafil use may cause priapism, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>painful</b> emergency condition {{that can cause}} impotence if left untreated.|$|E
25|$|Because swarm-founding colonies {{can contain}} {{more than one}} {{egg-laying}} queen, they tend to challenge current kin selection theory. in {{that they do not}} meet William D. Hamilton’s rule of haplodiploid eusocial Hymenoptera, in which all the sisters from a single mating of one queen with a parthenogenetically-produced male will share 75% of their genes. This wasp often has multiple strepsipteran endoparasites, and it delivers <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>painful</b> sting when threatened.|$|E
25|$|Eastern {{yellow jackets}} destroy many insects that consume {{cultivated}} and ornamental plants, providing {{a valuable service}} to humans. They can, however, {{be a source of}} irritation when their nests are located near homes. They are adept at stinging, especially if the nest is threatened. Not to be confused with certain bees that die after a single sting, these wasps may sting repeatedly whenever they feel it necessary and can inflict <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>painful</b> sting.|$|E
60|$|It is {{unavoidable}} {{that at this}} point the narrative should break off again, for <b>a</b> certain <b>very</b> <b>painful</b> reason that will presently be apparent.

25|$|The {{sulfanilamide}} compound is {{more active}} in the protonated form. The drug has very low solubility and sometimes can crystallize in the kidneys, due to its first pKa of around 10. This is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>painful</b> experience, so patients are told to take the medication with copious amounts of water. Newer analogous compounds prevent this complication {{because they have a}} lower pKa, around 5–6, making them more likely to remain in a soluble form.|$|E
25|$|PETA {{has also}} {{objected to the}} {{practice}} of mulesing (removing strips of wool-bearing skin from around the buttocks of a sheep). In October 2004, PETA launched a boycott against the Australian wool industry, leading some clothing retailers to ban products using Australian wool from their stores. In response, the Australian wool industry sued PETA, arguing among other things that mulesing prevents flystrike, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>painful</b> disease that can affect sheep. A settlement was reached, and PETA agreed to stop the boycott, while the wool industry agreed to seek alternatives to mulesing.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all known}} {{members of the}} family Synanceiidae, all members of the genus Inimicus possess a complex and {{extremely}} potent venom. It is stored in glands at the bases of needle-like spines in their dorsal fins. Upon contact with the dorsal fin, the fish can deliver <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>painful,</b> potentially fatal, sting. The venom consists of a mixture of proteolytic enzymes, including stonustoxin (a hemotoxin), trachynilysin (a neurotoxin), and cardioleputin (a cardiotoxin). Envenomation results severe and immediate local pain, sometimes followed by shock, paralysis, tissue necrosis, and even death.|$|E

25|$|After the war, the fraternities {{tried to}} re-establish themselves. This was <b>a</b> {{difficult}} and <b>very</b> <b>painful</b> process.

25|$|Due to {{the nature}} of {{proteolytic}} venom, a viperid bite is often <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>painful</b> experience and should always be taken seriously, though it may not necessarily prove fatal. Even with prompt and proper treatment, a bite can still result in a permanent scar, and in the worst cases, the affected limb may even have to be amputated. A victim's fate is impossible to predict, as this depends on many factors, including the species and size of the snake involved, how much venom was injected (if any), and the size and condition of the patient before being bitten. Viper bite victims may also be allergic to the venom and/or the antivenom.|$|E
500|$|On October 12, 1991, {{breaking}} news forced ABC News to interrupt regular Saturday morning programming again. Jennings {{was once again}} mindful of his audience, prefacing {{the coverage of the}} Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas with remarks for children. [...] "You may hear some not very nice language," [...] said Jennings. He noted that Thomas and his accuser, Anita Hill, [...] "have <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>painful</b> disagreement about some things the woman says the man did to her when they were working together...You can ask your parents to tell you more." [...] Jennings continued to produce special programs aimed at young viewers, anchoring Growing Up in the Age of AIDS, a frank, 90-minute-long discussion on AIDS in February 1992; and Prejudice: Answering Children's Questions, a forum on racism in April 1992.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Vincey's {{first impulse}} was {{naturally}} {{to join in}} the pursuit of his friend, in order if possible to save him from the violence of the indignant people. But his action was slow, the blow had half stunned him, and while this was still no more than a resolution came the news, shouted through the crowd, that Mr. Bessel had eluded his pursuers. At first Mr. Vincey could scarcely credit this, but the universality of the report, and presently the dignified return of two futile policemen, convinced him. After some aimless inquiries he returned towards Staple Inn, padding a handkerchief to <b>a</b> now <b>very</b> <b>painful</b> nose.|$|R
40|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> common <b>painful</b> syndrome, but its exact etiology {{still remains}} obscure. The diagnosis is essentially clinical, based on history-taking and physical examination. Complementary laboratory tests and imaging examinations {{may be useful}} for differential diagnoses. The treatment is essentially conservative, with a high success rate (around 90 %). The essence of the conservative treatment is the home-based program of exercises to stretch the plantar fascia. Indications for surgical treatment are only made when the symptoms persist without significant improvement, after {{at least six months}} of conservative treatment supervised directly by the doctor...|$|R

2500|$|These risks aside, {{promptly}} {{engaging in}} repair strategies helps {{to ensure the}} relationship recovers from transgressions.

[...] Utilizing repair strategies can have a transformative effect on the relationship through redefining rules and boundaries. [...] An added benefit can be gained through the closeness that can be realized as partners address transgressions. [...] Engaging in relationship talk such as metatalk prompts broader discussions about what each partner desires from the relationship and aligns expectations.

2500|$|Poorly {{produced}} moonshine can be contaminated, {{mainly from}} {{materials used in}} the construction of the still. Stills employing automotive radiators as condensers are particularly dangerous; in some cases, glycol, products from antifreeze, can appear as well. Radiators used as condensers also may contain lead at the connections to the plumbing. These methods often resulted in blindness or lead poisoning for those consuming tainted liquor. This was an issue during Prohibition when many died from ingesting unhealthy substances.
