5|$|As a {{description}} of the origin of the universe, the Big Bang has significant bearing on religion and philosophy. As a result, it {{has become one of the}} liveliest areas in the discourse between science and religion. Some believe the Big Bang implies <b>a</b> <b>creator,</b> and some see its mention in their holy books, while others argue that Big Bang cosmology makes the notion of <b>a</b> <b>creator</b> superfluous.|$|E
5|$|Asa Gray (November 18, 1810 – January 30, 1888) is {{considered}} the most important American botanist of the 19thcentury. His Darwiniana was considered an important explanation of how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive. Gray was adamant that a genetic connection must exist between all members of a species. He was also strongly opposed to the ideas of hybridization within one generation and special creation {{in the sense of}} its not allowing for evolution, as he felt evolution was guided by <b>a</b> <b>Creator.</b>|$|E
5|$|Barbera's {{first foray}} into {{television}} was a 1957 collaboration with Robert D. Buchanan, Colonel Bleep. The series, the first ever cartoon produced specifically for color television, would feature some of the futuristic designs and limited animation Barbera would later carry over to his other television productions. Barbera's involvement in Colonel Bleep (and with Buchanan) was apparently short-lived; his only known credited involvement was <b>a</b> <b>creator</b> credit.|$|E

5|$|David's {{character}} arc {{throughout the}} Alien prequel series, with his role becoming increasingly central, has been lauded by critics. Kevin Lincoln of Vulture magazine described David {{as being the}} best cinematic villain in years, due to his dynamic personality and ability to win against the characters in Alien: Covenant. John Squires of Bloody Disgusting praised David for supplanting the main protagonist of the first four films, Ellen Ripley, as the overall best character of the franchise in 2017. Squires perceived David's passion to become <b>a</b> <b>creator</b> in Alien: Covenant as a retroactive explanation for poisoning Holloway in Prometheus. Eschewing from most reviews, Wenlei Ma from News.com.au complimented Fassbender's ability to portray David, though she criticized the mystery lost by revealing the character's true intentions.|$|E
5|$|Josephson {{said that}} Trinity College's long {{interest}} in the paranormal meant {{that he did not}} dismiss these ideas out of hand. Several presidents of the Society for Psychical Research had been fellows of Trinity, and the Perrott-Warrick Fund, set up in Trinity in 1937 to fund parapsychology research, is still administered by the college. He continued to explore {{the idea that there is}} intelligence in nature, particularly after reading Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics (1975), and in 1979 took up a more advanced form of TM, known as the TM-Sidhi program. According to Anderson, the TM movement produced a poster showing Josephson levitating several inches above the floor. Josephson argued that meditation could lead to mystical and scientific insights, and that, as a result of it, he had come to believe in <b>a</b> <b>creator.</b>|$|E

5|$|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} seven people, and took ten months to make. It was directed by Shu Takumi and produced by Atsushi Inaba, with music by Masakazu Sugimori, character design by Kumiko Suekane, and art by Tatsuro Iwamoto. In 2000, after Takumi had finished his work on Dino Crisis 2, his boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to. Takumi had originally joined Capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games, and felt that this was a big chance for him to make a mark as <b>a</b> <b>creator.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Nicaragua {{earthquake}} was {{the first}} tsunami earthquake to be captured on modern broadband seismic networks. The initial surface wave magnitude was estimated at 7.2. The shock occurred on the subduction interface between the Cocos and Caribbean Plates, an active zone of stress and deformation, and due {{to the absence of}} sediment on the ocean floor off Nicaragua, the slip propagated up-dip {{all the way to the}} trench bottom, <b>a</b> <b>creator</b> of large tsunamis. This occurrence of slip of a plate interface filled with soft subducted sediments caused the rupturing process to be slower than the average subduction zone thrust earthquakes while the focus of the earthquake was much shallower than the typical subduction zone earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The Wiyot {{tribe of}} California {{say that the}} condor recreated mankind after Above Old Man wiped {{humanity}} out with a flood. However, other tribes, such as California's Mono, viewed the condor as a destroyer, not <b>a</b> <b>creator.</b> They say that Condor seized humans, cut off their heads, and drained their blood {{so that it would}} flood Ground Squirrel's home. Condor then seized Ground Squirrel after he fled, but Ground Squirrel managed to cut off Condor's head when Condor paused to take a drink of the blood. According to the Yokut tribe, the condor sometimes ate the moon, causing the lunar cycle, and his wings caused eclipses. The Chumash tribe of Southern California believed that the condor was once a white bird, but it turned black when it flew too close to a fire.|$|E

5|$|The book {{describes}} how the relationship between insects and plants resulted in the beautiful and complex forms which natural theology attributed to a grand designer. By showing how practical adaptations develop from cumulative minor variations of parts of the flowers to suit new purposes, Darwin countered the prevailing view that beautiful organisms were the handiwork of <b>a</b> <b>Creator.</b> Darwin's painstaking observations, experiments, and detailed dissection of the flowers explained previously unknown features such as the puzzle of Catasetum, which had been thought to have three completely different species of flowers on the same plant. In addition, they produced testable predictions including his then-controversial proposal that the long nectary of Angraecum sesquipedale meant {{that there must be}} a moth with an equally long proboscis. This was confirmed in 1903 when Xanthopan morganii praedicta was found in Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} created by Shu Takumi, who wrote and {{directed}} the first three games. The first game was conceived in 2000 when Takumi's boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to; Takumi had originally joined Capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games, and {{felt that this was}} a big chance for him to make a mark as <b>a</b> <b>creator.</b> The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. It was originally going to be a detective game, with Phoenix being a private investigator, but at one point Takumi realized that finding and taking apart contradictions was not related to detective work, and felt that the main setting of the game should be courtrooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{beliefs of}} the Sihanaka, as elsewhere in Madagascar, revolve around respect for <b>a</b> <b>creator</b> god (Zanahary), the ancestors, and fady (ancestral interdictions). Aspects of ancestor worship among the Sihanaka include joro (collective prayers said to invoke the blessings of God or the ancestors), burial in family tombs, the famadihana reburial ceremony, and the sanctification of particular stones (tsangambato), land (tany masina), and shrines (doany, tony and jiro). Another major element of this tradition {{is the role of}} ambalavelona, believed to be the spirits of the ancestors themselves. Each ancestral practice or tradition has a particular spirit associated with it, and the Sihanaka show respect for these spirits by maintaining ancestral customs and traditions and adhering to fady.|$|E

5|$|As Messi {{developed}} into {{a combination of a}} number 8 (<b>a</b> <b>creator),</b> a 9 (scorer), and a 10 (assistant), he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the 2011–12 season, producing a hat-trick or more on 10 occasions. He began the campaign by helping Barcelona win both the Spanish and European Super Cups; in the Supercopa de España, he scored three times to achieve a 5–4 aggregate victory over Real Madrid, overtaking Raúl as the competition's all-time top scorer with eight goals. At the close of the year, on 18 December, he scored twice in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a 4–0 victory over Santos, earning the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament, as he had done two years previously. For his efforts in 2011, he again received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times, after Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Marco van Basten. Additionally, he won the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, a revival of the old-style Ballon d'Or. By then, Messi was already widely considered one of the best footballers in history, alongside players like Diego Maradona and Pelé.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the many}} ethnic sub-groups in Madagascar adhere to their own set of beliefs, {{practices}} and ways of life that have historically contributed to their unique identities. However, {{there are a number}} of core cultural features that are common throughout the island, creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity. In addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around <b>a</b> <b>creator</b> god and veneration of the ancestors, the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize fihavanana (solidarity), vintana (destiny), tody (karma), and hasina, a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family. Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision; strong kinship ties; a widespread belief in the power of magic, diviners, astrology and witch doctors; and a traditional division of social classes into nobles, commoners, and slaves.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{at the end}} of the 19th century, the Brazilian {{abolitionist}} leader Joaquim Nabuco {{said that}} Rio Branco was—of all the politicians who held the office during PedroII's reign—the most fitted to the post of President of the Council of Ministers. Nabuco considered him one of the greatest statesmen of the Empire. However, he also argued that as a leader, a lawmaker, and <b>a</b> <b>creator</b> of doctrines, there were many other politicians far better than Rio Branco. But unlike all the others, who were brilliantly accomplished in one or a few skills, but lacking in many others, Rio Branco was good—though unexceptional—in all. In other words, he was a competent generalist. Nabuco's view was that due to Rio Branco's lack of first-rate abilities, he would not have been the best leader in troubled times—such as the anarchy which existed during PedroII's minority, or {{at the end of}} a period of chaos when strong action was needed to rebuild. Rio Branco was, however, the perfect choice in a time of peace and stability where his multiple skills could shine. His ability exactly fit the situation in Brazil when he became President of the Council of Ministers in 1871.|$|E

25|$|Theistic {{evolution}} and evolutionary creationism are theologies that reconcile belief in <b>a</b> <b>creator</b> with biological evolution. Each holds {{the view that}} there is <b>a</b> <b>creator</b> but that this creator has employed the natural force of evolution to unfold a divine plan. Religious representatives from faiths compatible with theistic {{evolution and}} evolutionary creationism have challenged the growing perception that belief in <b>a</b> <b>creator</b> is inconsistent with the acceptance of evolutionary theory. Spokespersons from the Catholic Church have specifically criticized biblical creationism for relying upon literal interpretations of biblical scripture {{as the basis for}} determining scientific fact.|$|E
25|$|There are {{inherent}} and fundamental differences between Buddhism and Christianity, one significant element being that while Christianity {{is at its}} core monotheistic and relies on a God as <b>a</b> <b>Creator,</b> Buddhism is generally non-theistic and rejects the notion of <b>a</b> <b>Creator</b> God which provides divine values for the world.|$|E
