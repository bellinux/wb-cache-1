5|$|In a study, eight addax antelopes {{on a diet}} {{of grass}} hay (Chloris gayana) were studied to {{determine}} the retention time of food from the digestive tract. It was found that food retention time was long, taken as an adaptation to a diet including {{a high proportion of}} slow fermenting grasses; while the long fluid retention time could be interpreted to be due to water-saving mechanisms with low water turnover and <b>a</b> <b>roomy</b> rumen.|$|E

When disturbed, it can move quite briskly and even drop off. The caterpillars of the brown awl grow faster than most of those of other families, and have moist, sticky droppings.|$|E
25|$|While the Series 200 {{was more}} commercially attractive, {{with no more}} Series 100 being ordered, sales were still slow. While the Herald was cheap {{compared}} to its major competitors, and in the 200 series had <b>a</b> <b>roomy</b> cabin, the Friendship could carry a larger payload and both the Friendship and the Avro 748 had better performance, resulting in superior long-term economics. By 1963, only 35 Heralds had been sold compared with over 240 Friendships.|$|E

25|$|The Rose turret was <b>a</b> <b>roomy</b> design {{equipped}} with two M2 Browning heavy machine guns. The turret {{was driven by}} hydraulics, and the hydraulic system was easier to use than that in previous designs. The considerable internal space meant that the turret could be fitted with two seats: a layout in which one man operated the guns and the other fed targeting data into the gunsight computer was developed, but not used in practice.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1982, Teague {{worked on}} the first large cars sold by AMC since 1978, the front-drive sedan code named X-58, for {{introduction}} in late-1986. and a companion code named X-59, that was to debut for the 1988 model year. He achieved <b>a</b> <b>roomy</b> interior in an aerodynamic design, and the two-door model was to have featured hidden headlamps, but the coupe was never produced. Giorgetto Giugiaro penned the sharper-edged exterior design for the four-door sedan that went into production as the Eagle Premier.|$|E
25|$|The {{boat was}} built by Paceship Yachts in Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada. It was first offered in 1967 in the Daysailer version, with <b>a</b> <b>roomy</b> cockpit and an open cuddy (cabin). By 1970 it was also offered in the MORCEE version, a {{modification}} of the original design, which was adapted {{to comply with the}} Midget Ocean Racing Club Rule (MORC) by fitting a self-bailing cockpit and enclosing the cabin. A total of at least 107 boats were produced (including both versions, based on known hulls) between 1967 and 1974. It is now out of production.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, Wacanda boats had evolved {{distinctive}} styling and performance features including on the v-hulls a flared and concave (hollow) bow profile and ‘squared off’ bow. These features resulted in <b>a</b> <b>roomier</b> interior, {{as well as}} a very dry boat.|$|R
50|$|Compared to the {{previous}} generation, the Golf Mk7 has <b>a</b> <b>roomier</b> cabin, with greater shoulder room for {{the front and rear}} passengers, rear legroom and boot space. It is 20 mm broader than the Mk6 and the wheelbase is 59 mm longer.|$|R
5000|$|Most compact MPVs {{have better}} [...] "flexibility" [...] than other body styles: for example, seats may be {{individually}} folded or even removed. Due to the multi-purpose architecture, the bonnet may be shorter and the passengers sit more upright than in regular cars, providing for <b>a</b> <b>roomier</b> interior.|$|R
500|$|The [...] {{river is}} {{maintained}} at an artificially high level and falls {{a couple of}} metres when the sluice is lowered to allow access to {{the fourth and fifth}} chambers, two small air spaces. Normally, however, these are only accessible by cave diving. Beyond the fifth chamber <b>a</b> <b>roomy</b> submerged route may be followed for a further , passing under three large rifts with air spaces, to surface in the ninth chamber– <b>a</b> <b>roomy</b> chamber over [...] long and the same high.

500|$|Besides the hotel, Lum Chang Holdings also leased out the {{building}} to several tenants who operated shops and other businesses. The L-shaped ground floor was partitioned for 8 of these shops. People commonly referred to the entire Nam Tin building as the Great Southern Hotel when the hotel subsequently became very popular. The Nam Tin Building became a major shopping hub for customers who found it fashionable to patronise {{the building}}'s shops, outlets and cabarets. Chinese operas used to be staged at the building as an occasional attraction. The Southern Cabaret, based in the Diamond Dragon Dance Palace on the fifth floor, was of particular extravagance, as this article in The Straits Times describes it: [...] "Dragon pillars studded with cut glass… constructed {{under the supervision of}} Miss Leong Sai Chan, former Shanghai movie star, the cabaret is an imitation of China's famed Peking palace. Beautifully coloured carvings of birds and animals of Chinese mythology decorate the walls of cabaret." [...] Operated by the Cantonese, the Great Southern Hotel catered more to Chinese travellers, including celebrities from Hong Kong and China. This was unlike the upmarket hotels like Raffles Hotel, Goodwood Park Hotel and Adelphi Hotel which then accommodated mainly Europeans and English-speaking visitors. As a boutique hotel with shops and entertainment outlets for rich Chinese immigrants, the Great Southern Hotel was considered as the [...] "Raffles Hotel of Chinatown". Each room had its own ensuite shower and toilet, and was given <b>a</b> <b>roomy</b> feeling by the 4m high ceiling and cast iron casement windows. The latter let in far more light than the wooden windows commonly found on shophouses in the-now Kreta Ayer Conservation Area, which were largely in the Transitional and Art Deco styles.|$|E
5000|$|Top-trimmed Studebakers from 1955-1958 {{went by the}} Studebaker President name (revived {{from the}} prewar President models). For 1956, an upscale President Classic sedan was offered. The President Classic used the longer 120.5" [...] {{wheelbase}} of the Hawks, and like the 1947-1950 Land Cruisers used the additional length to create <b>a</b> <b>roomier</b> rear passenger area. The President Classic was continued for 1957-1958, though no longer carrying the [...] "Classic" [...] model name. After a four-year run, The President models, in turn, were dropped {{at the end of}} 1958 {{to make way for the}} new compact Lark model. A longer wheelbase version of the Lark sedan was offered for fleet sales. Dubbed the Economiler, it was marketed for use as a taxicab, again featuring <b>a</b> <b>roomier</b> back seat area than the regular Larks.|$|R
5|$|Florida {{was fitted}} {{experimentally}} {{with a larger}} bridge than was then standard, to house both ship and fire control personnel under armor, while Utah received a heavily armored fire-control tower atop a standard-sized bridge. The former proved especially successful, {{to the point that}} when a larger armored fire-control tower and standard bridge was proposed for the Nevada class, it was rejected in favor of <b>a</b> <b>roomier</b> bridge like that of Florida.|$|R
25|$|The {{civilian}} production version, or Series 40, {{was slightly}} refined over the prototype, with more speed and <b>a</b> <b>roomier</b> cabin. North American then stretched the design by 3feet 2inches, providing greater cabin space, and marketed {{it as the}} Series 60, which was certificated in April 1967. The cabin was made taller for the Series 70 and General Electric CF700 turbofans were installed for the Series 75A (also branded as the Series 80).|$|R
2500|$|Available {{only in a}} two-door hardtop, body style, the Javelin came in {{base and}} more premium SST models. Standard engines were a [...] straight-6 or a [...] two-barrel {{carburetor}} V8. Optional was a [...] V8 in regular gasoline two-barrel, or high-compression, premium-fuel four-barrel versions. Racing driver Gordon Johncock said the Javelin had [...] "a nice, all-round blend of features", [...] that it [...] "stacks up as <b>a</b> <b>roomy,</b> comfortable, peppy and handsome example of a so-called [...] "pony car" [...] and that after his road test he [...] "wanted to take it home." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Hudson Motor Car Company was one {{of several}} {{independent}} firms competing with the much larger Big Three U.S. automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) that produced mainly [...] "standard" [...] large-sized models. Hudson had limited financial resources, and management decided to develop a compact-sized model instead of refurbishing its line of full-size cars and developing a V8 engine. The Hudson Jet had exclusive engineering that included <b>a</b> <b>roomy,</b> comfortable, and solid welded unibody, as well as featuring excellent performance for the era along with good fuel economy and low cost maintenance.|$|E
2500|$|For {{a mature}} Leonberger, the height at the withers is ideally the median of the breed's range— {{for males and}} [...] for females. Capable of {{demanding}} work, the Leonberger is a dog of ample substance. Its frame is supported with well-muscled, medium to heavy bone {{in direct proportion to}} its size. <b>A</b> <b>roomy</b> chest is sufficiently broad and deep for the purpose of work. Seen in profile, the chest curves inward from the pro-sternum, tangently joins the elbow to its underline at fifty percent of the withers' height and then continues slightly upward toward the stifle.|$|E

The A319CJ competes with the Boeing BBJ1, Gulfstream G550, and Bombardier Global Express. Because of its wider fuselage diameter, it offers <b>a</b> <b>roomier</b> interior than its competitors. It is powered by the same engine types as the A320, either the CFM International CFM56-5 or the V2527.|$|R

The gipsy's birdlike eyes pierced and darted {{from one to the}} other of us, her skinny hand concealing her mouth. I felt as light as a feather, and thankful that my mud-caked shoes and petticoats were hardly discernible as none too elegantly I scrambled down from the cart.|$|R
50|$|The {{prototype}} K 8 {{made its}} first flight in November 1957 and over 1,100 were built in three main versions. The original K 8 had a very small canopy. Side windows for improved visibility were introduced in the next version, and the K 8B, {{by far the most}} numerous variant, has a larger one-piece blown Plexiglas canopy. The K 8C features a longer nose, larger main wheel located ahead of the center of gravity and deletion of the larger wooden nose skid resulting in <b>a</b> <b>roomier</b> cockpit.|$|R
2500|$|The C.23 had a flat sided fuselage. [...] There was a gunner's {{position}} in the nose, equipped with twin Lewis guns. <b>A</b> <b>roomy</b> open cockpit was positioned under the wing leading edge, with a separate gunner's cockpit behind it under a large, rounded trailing edge cut-out. This was fitted with another pair of Lewis guns and a further gun firing downwards through a trapdoor in the floor. A low, broad fin carried a broad balanced rudder which extended down to the keel. The tailplane, angular in plan and of very low aspect ratio, was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage and its elevators had a cut-out for rudder movement.|$|E
2500|$|The Sting Ray's {{interior}} {{carried a}} new {{interpretation of the}} twin-cowl Corvette dash motif used since 1958, It was also more practical, now incorporating <b>a</b> <b>roomy</b> glovebox, an improved heater, and the cowl-ventilation system. A full set of round gauges included a huge speedometer and tachometer. The control tower center console returned, somewhat slimmer but now containing the clock and a vertically situated radio. Luggage space was improved as well, though {{due to a lack}} of an external trunklid, cargo had to be loaded behind the seats. The spare tire was located at the rear in a drop-down fiberglass housing beneath the gas tank (which now held [...] instead of [...] The big, round deck emblem was newly hinged to double as a fuel-filler flap, replacing the previous left-flank door.|$|E
2500|$|In 1915, Scott {{moved to}} Twentynine Palms, {{where he lived}} quietly until Johnson decided to visit him. [...] Johnson {{eventually}} forgave Scott for his fraudulent scheming, and the two became friends. Johnson soon purchased the Staininger Ranch in Grapevine Canyon for his own use, and in 1929, prior {{to the stock market}} crash, began developing the property of what later became Lower Vine Ranch, approximately five miles away. Although Johnson had originally installed quarters for Scotty at Grapevine, he also built <b>a</b> <b>roomy</b> five-room cabin for Scott at Lower Vine as well as several outbuildings and a corral for Scott's beloved mules. Johnson also used the land at Lower Vine for a short while to farm alfalfa so he could legally claim the property for himself under the Homesteading Act. [...] Scott immediately returned to his old ways of spreading unbelievable tales about his mine, which Johnson did nothing to discourage, regarding it as merely amusement.|$|E

2500|$|Lacking the {{financial}} resources for a full redesign, AMC dropped the large Ambassador after 1974, while the Matador was discontinued after 1978, {{around the same time}} as Ford moved their full-size nameplates to a smaller platform. The downsized 1977 Chevrolet Impala also spelled doom for large intermediates from AMC and Chrysler. American Motors responded to the declining demand for large cars by introducing a new nameplate in 1978, the AMC Concord. The Concord was an upmarket restyling and positioning of the compact AMC Hornet which had the same [...] wheelbase as the redesigned intermediate 1978 Chevrolet Malibu. It was presented as combining an [...] "easy-to-handle size with <b>a</b> <b>roomy</b> sumptuous interior" [...] and in contrast to the Matador coupe, the [...] "overall styling was pleasant... would not offend anyone" [...] This was the first full-line of economical, compact-sized cars with luxurious trim, features, and comfort levels previously available only in larger automobiles.|$|E
2500|$|Both sexes possess {{pairs of}} gonads, opening via a channel called a gonoduct into a common genital opening, the gonopore, {{which is located}} on the rear ventral side. Both the gonads and the gonoduct are derived from true coelom tissue. In females, the two ovaries are joined in the middle and to the {{horizontal}} diaphragm. The gonoduct appears differently depending on whether the species is live-bearing or egg-laying. In the former, each exit channel divides into a slender oviduct and <b>a</b> <b>roomy</b> [...] "womb", the uterus, in which the embryos develop. The single vagina, to which both uteri are connected, runs outward to the gonopore. In egg-laying species, whose gonoduct is uniformly constructed, the genital opening lies at the tip of a long egg-laying apparatus, the ovipositor. The females of many species also possess a sperm repository called the receptacle seminis, in which sperm cells from males can be stored temporarily or for longer periods. Males possess two separate testes, along with the corresponding sperm vesicle (the vesicula seminalis) and exit channel (the vasa efferentia). The two vasa efferentia unite to a common sperm duct, the vas deferens, which in turn widens through the ejaculatory channel to open at the gonopore. Directly beside or behind this lie two pairs of special glands, which probably serve an auxiliary reproductive function; the rearmost glands are also known as anal glands. A penis-like structure has so far only been found in males of the genus Paraperipatus but has not yet been observed in action. As previously mentioned, males of many Australian species exhibit special structures on the head, which apparently take over certain tasks in transferring sperm to the females. In the species Euperipatoides rowelli, sperm is collected by these structures, and, when a female is encountered, the male inserts its head in the vagina.|$|E

50|$|Compared to the {{previous}} generation, the León Mk3 is shorter by 5 cm and lighter by up to 90 kilograms; however, because its wheelbase has been extended by 5.8 cm, it has <b>a</b> <b>roomier</b> cabin with greater shoulder room for {{the front and rear}} passengers, more rear legroom and 380 L of boot space. The first official information and pictures of the car were released in July 16, 2012, while it got its public debut only a few months later, at the 2012 Paris Motor Show, in September. That makes Leon the second car {{to be based on the}} MQB platform.|$|R
50|$|The Nightclub 9:30, {{originally}} named {{and still}} {{commonly referred to}} as the 9:30 Club, also known simply as the 9:30, is a nightclub and concert venue in Washington, D.C., which was originally housed in the ground floor rear room of the Atlantic Building at 930 F Street NW, in the city's downtown area, where it opened on May 31, 1980, with a legal standing capacity of only 199 patrons. In 1996, due to its increasing prominence, the club was moved to <b>a</b> <b>roomier</b> space, its current location at 815 V Street NW, where it anchors the eastern end of the U Street Corridor.|$|R
5|$|The He 111P {{incorporated}} the updated Daimler-Benz DB 601A-1 liquid-cooled engine and featured a newly designed nose section, including an asymmetric mounting for an MG 15 machine gun that replaced the 'stepped' cockpit with <b>a</b> <b>roomier</b> and more aerodynamic glazed stepless cockpit {{over the entire}} front of the aircraft. This smooth glazed nose was first tested on the He 111 V8 in January 1938. These improvements allowed the aircraft to reach 475km/h (295mph) at 5,000m (16,400ft) and a cruise speed of 370km/h (230mph), although a full bomb load reduced this figure to 300km/h (190mph). The design was implemented in 1937 because pilot reports indicated problems with visibility.|$|R
