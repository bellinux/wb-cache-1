The World Organisation for Animal Health has added to the Terrestrial <b>Animal</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Code</b> a series of guidelines with recommendations to its members for the creation and harmonization of national antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programs, monitoring of the quantities of antibiotics used in animal husbandry, and recommendations to ensure the proper and prudent use of antibiotic substances.

An animal is in a good state of welfare if (as indicated by scientific evidence) it is healthy, comfortable, well nourished, safe, able to express innate behaviour, and if it is not suffering from unpleasant states such as pain, fear, and distress. Good animal welfare requires disease prevention and veterinary treatment, appropriate shelter, management, nutrition, humane handling and humane slaughter/killing. Animal welfare refers to the state of the animal; the treatment that an animal receives is covered by other terms such as animal care, animal husbandry, and humane treatment." ...|$|E

40|$|Rinderpest, {{also known}} as cattle plague, is a {{contagious}} viral disease affecting clovenhoofed animals mainly cattle and buffalo. Rinderpest {{is caused by a}} virus of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Morbillivirus. Many species of wild and domestic cloven-hoofed animals including sheep and goats, show milder symptoms of the disease when infected, but the mortality rate can reach up to 100 per cent in highly susceptible cattle or buffalo herds. The OIE Terrestrial <b>Animal</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Code</b> contains detailed recommendations on prevention and control of rinderpest.

40|$|Sina Taulealo, {{veterinary}} {{officer in}} Samoa, only needs a CD-ROM to access comprehensive information on, for example, {{the distribution of}} the fowl pox virus throughout the Pacific Island Countries and Territories, and to perform an accurate risk analysis for his region. At the touch of a button, he can retrieve technical information on the virus, run an analysis on susceptible livestock species, and find the contact details of professional colleagues on other islands who have experience in dealing with the disease. The above scenario is the result of efforts by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community Regional <b>Animal</b> <b>Health</b> Service (SPC RAHS), which was established in 1991 to support the region´s veterinary services. On many Pacific islands these services face a number of constraints such as the lack of access to professional literature and up-to-date information on international <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> standards, and unreliable or unreferenced data. Such information is necessary to carry out risk analyses, make quarantine decisions or conduct investigations of suspected disease outbreaks. The situation is exacerbated by poor communications infrastructures, and the lack of laboratory diagnostic capabilities or limited access to such facilities. To remedy these problems, the RAHS, in collaboration with the Office International des Epizooties (OIE), has developed the Pacific <b>Animal</b> <b>Health</b> Information System (PAHIS) database, which is now available on CD-ROM. The PAHIS database was initially developed as a web-based tool in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 1997, but its success was limited due to the poor Internet connectivity {{in many parts of the}} Pacific. Based on the experience of its predecessor, the new version of PAHIS has been developed to run on most personal computers without an Internet connection. Local veterinary services receive with the database a free runtime version of all the required programs on a CD-ROM, which is updated every year. The PAHIS CD-ROM contains a wide range of information, including country reports, contact details, livestock populations by country and by species, and the veterinary facilities and infrastructures in Pacific countries. It also contains updated information on the distribution of animal diseases, based on data from the OIE´s World <b>Animal</b> <b>Health</b> yearbook, and from disease surveys and <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> status reports. Users can search the PAHIS database for information on animal disease distributions in the Pacific region using multiple criteria such as disease names, geographic coverage, susceptible species, and categories of commodities (such as meat, milk and semen) that may be responsible for spreading pathogens. To address the specific requirements of officials who need to carry out import risk analyses and make quarantine decisions, comparisons of the disease status of countries are also available. The results are displayed in tables and maps that can be easily incorporated into reports. But PAHIS is more than a simple database. It also includes technical documents and international standards such as the OIE international <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>codes,</b> manuals for the recognition of exotic livestock diseases, diagnostics and vaccines, and disease recognition cards. The information provided by PAHIS can also assist veterinary services and other government agencies in taking the most appropriate decisions to protect their animal populations from exotic diseases. The new version of PAHIS was officially launched at the 23 rd Conference of the OIE Regional Commission for Asia, the Far East and Oceania on 26 - 29 November 2003. During that conference, PAHIS was demonstrated to delegates from the SPC member countries with veterinary services: American Samoa, Fiji, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Northern Marianas, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu. The PAHIS CD-ROM has been designed as a tool to assist the veterinary services of the Pacific region, or those who carry similar responsibilities for their local authorities.

The poor coverage of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information on the web emanates from many factors: poor ICT (Information Communications Technology) infrastructure in many African countries, lack of ICT literacy, awareness and mindset, lack of recognition of all the values of information services, poor state of African indexing and abstracting services, inadequate funds, and perceived misconceptions of actual causes of the problem.
