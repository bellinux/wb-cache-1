40|$|The XPD helicase {{contains}} a redox active [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster and the protein {{is required for}} both nucleotide excision repair and transcription. Using ATPase and helicase mutants of XPD, we have demonstrated that the DNA-bound redox signal is a sensitive reporter of ATP hydrolysis and reports on DNA conformational changes <b>assocd.</b> with enzymic function. Other XPD mutants, which are <b>assocd.</b> with disease, show low abs. signals without ATP, reflecting poor protein/DNA electronic coupling. In an AFM assay, monitoring {{the first step in}} searching for lesions, those mutants that show low electronic signaling are unable to redistribute onto DNA strands contg. a single base mismatch. This reduced efficiency in DNA-mediated signaling may therefore be implicated in diseases <b>assocd.</b> with DNA repair. Therefore, we have begun exploring the in vivo effects of varying CT proficiency in both yeast Rad 3 and SaXPD proteins to explore the biol. consequences of deficiencies in DNA-mediated signaling...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA review. Many {{discrete}} cationic complexes {{have been}} designed and exhibited increasingly impressive catalytic performances for the ROP of epoxides and cyclic esters. The current state-of-the-art suggests that major breakthroughs cannot be foreseen in the homopolymn. of epoxides, {{due to the nature}} of the <b>assocd.</b> mechanisms, and as a consequence, interest in the use of metal cations to polymerize epoxides has dwindled. It seems to the authors that in view of the activated monomer mechanism that is often <b>assocd.</b> with discrete metal cations, this is clearly an area where the use of rationally devised cationic complexes could bring original breakthroughs...|$|R
