5|$|Tatuidris, or {{armadillo}} ant, {{is a rare}} genus of ants {{consisting of}} a single species, Tatuidris tatusia. The ants are small in size and inhabit the leaf litter of Neotropical forests in Central and South America, from Mexico to Brazil. Workers are ferruginous-colored to dark red and present a distinctive morphology, consisting of a shield-like head with a broad vertex, ventrally-turned heavy mandibles which do not overlap at full closure, and unique among ants– <b>an</b> <b>antenna</b> socket apparatus sitting upside-down. Little {{is known about the}} biology of the ants, but they are likely nocturnal and specialist predators.|$|E

5|$|By 2005, {{several other}} EyeTV {{products}} had been introduced, {{such as the}} EyeTV for DTT, the EyeTV EZ and the EyeTV Wonder. The EyeTV for DTT (digital terrestrial TV) is a small USB-powered device with <b>an</b> <b>antenna</b> for receiving free over-the-air television broadcasts. It received a 4 out of 5 rating in TechRadar. A review in The Register gave it an 85 percent rating. The Eye TV Wonder was only available from July 2005 to January 2006, before being discontinued and replaced with the Eye TV EZ. The EZ was a basic, entry-level product with an analog tuner for watching TV on a Mac computer.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, the USAF {{began looking}} for a {{replacement}} for its fighter aircraft, especially to counter the advanced Su-27 and MiG-29. A number of companies, divided into two teams, submitted their proposals. Northrop and McDonnell Douglas submitted the YF-23. Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics proposed and built the YF-22, which, although marginally slower and having a larger radar cross-section, was more agile than the YF-23. Primarily for this reason, it was picked by the Air Force as {{the winner of the}} ATF in April 1991. Following the selection, the first YF-22 was retired to a museum, while the second prototype continued flying until an accident relegated it to the role of <b>an</b> <b>antenna</b> test vehicle.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} 4 {{days since the}} crash, September 25, 2004. Locke awakens from Oceanic Flight 815's crash and wiggles his toes, realizing that {{he is no longer}} paralyzed. Boars raid the body-filled fuselage, causing Jack to decide it should be burned. The next day, the {{survivors}} discover that their food is exhausted, and wonder what to do. Locke reveals to hold many hunting knives, and suggests to go after the boar in the jungle. On his hunting mission, Locke is accompanied by Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) – who was given by Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) <b>an</b> <b>antenna,</b> which after being set will help triangulate the signal of the French transmission heard two days before – and Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau).|$|E
5|$|On 20 March 2009, Emirates Airline Flight 407, an Airbus A340-500, {{was taking}} off from Melbourne Airport on Runway 16 for a flight to Dubai International Airport and failed to become {{airborne}} in the normal distance. When the aircraft was {{nearing the end of}} the runway, the crew commanded nose-up sharply, causing its tail to scrape along the runway as it became airborne, during which smoke was observed in the cabin. The crew dumped fuel and returned to the airport. The damage caused to the aircraft was considered substantial. The aircraft damaged a strobe {{light at the end of}} the runway as well as <b>an</b> <b>antenna</b> on the localiser, which led to the ILS being out of service for some time causing some disruptions to the airport's operation.|$|E
50|$|The {{longer the}} {{effective}} length the more voltage {{and therefore the}} more power the antenna will receive. Note, however, that <b>an</b> <b>antenna's</b> gain or Aeff increases according to the square of leff, and that this proportionality also involves the antenna's radiation resistance. Therefore, this measure is of more theoretical than practical value and is not, by itself, a useful figure of merit relating to <b>an</b> <b>antenna's</b> directivity.|$|R

25|$|Any {{metal or}} {{conductive}} object placed into the microwave {{will act as}} <b>an</b> <b>antenna</b> to some degree, resulting in an electric current.

25|$|Shorter {{wavelength}} {{bands are}} particularly useful for aviation use. <b>An</b> <b>antenna</b> that broadcast a useful signal at longwave frequencies would {{be larger than}} a typical aircraft (although Zeppelins had no problems) and even higher frequencies in the high frequency (HF) and very high frequency (VHF) bands were highly desirable.|$|E
25|$|Immunity to {{electromagnetic}} interference: Light transmission through {{optical fibers}} is unaffected by other electromagnetic radiation nearby. The optical fiber is electrically non-conductive, {{so it does}} not act as <b>an</b> <b>antenna</b> to pick up electromagnetic signals. Information traveling inside the optical fiber is immune to electromagnetic interference, even electromagnetic pulses generated by nuclear devices.|$|E
2500|$|The first 2,200 cars {{produced}} used <b>a</b> windshield-embedded <b>antenna.</b> This type of antenna {{proved to}} be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually [...] "seek", attempting to find a signal. <b>A</b> standard whip <b>antenna</b> {{was added to the}} outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and <b>an</b> unsightly <b>antenna.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, the <b>antenna</b> was again moved, this time {{to the rear of the}} car. Automatic antennas were installed under the grills behind the rear driver's-side window. While giving the reception quality of <b>a</b> whip <b>antenna,</b> these completely disappear from view when not in use.|$|R

25|$|In a radar set, the magnetron's {{waveguide}} {{is connected}} to <b>an</b> <b>antenna.</b> The magnetron is operated with very short pulses of applied voltage, resulting in a short pulse of high power microwave energy being radiated. As in all primary radar systems, the radiation reflected off a target is analyzed to produce a radar map on a screen.|$|E
25|$|Stations in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, can {{be viewed}} over {{the air with a}} {{suitable}} antenna, but those in Seattle are too distant to receive in most locations in the county.
