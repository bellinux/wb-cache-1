Aying's parents sought legal action against CESAFI and the league's commissioner, Felix Tiukinhoy, Jr. Aying's parents argued that Tiukinhoy and other league officials “wrongfully interpreted the tournament’s rules and [...] "unjustly disqualified" [...] our son”. The judge later allowed the younger <b>Aying</b> to play, stating that <b>Aying</b> did not violate the league's two-year residency rule.|$|E

50|$|The branch line, which {{originally}} ran {{only from}} Munich-Giesing to <b>Aying,</b> {{was one of}} the last radial railway lines built between Munich and its surroundings. The municipalities of Peiß, Helfendorf, Egmating, Siegertsbrunn, Hohenbrunn, Höhenkirchen, Brunnthal and Oberpframmern sought the construction of a railway from 1892. For the present, however, the Munich East-Deisenhofen line was given preference. According to the first plans, south of Aying/Peiß the line would run have run through Helfendorf to Grub, where it would have connected to the Mangfall Valley Railway. Also being considered was a route running west to Otterfing on the line from Deisenhofen to Holzkirchen or running directly to Holzkirchen. There was also disagreement over the location of the station in Dürrnhaar (the westernmost village of Faistenhaar wanted to see the route run further west) and the railhead in <b>Aying.</b> The latter was originally built further south between <b>Aying</b> and Peiß (near the current level crossing). The construction of the railway was approved on 2 March 1900. Construction started on the line on 1 April 1902. A train with several celebrities (including the Minister of Transport) made a trial run on the line on 28 May 1904 and it was opened shortly thereafter on 5 June. The extension of the line to Kreuzstraße went into operation in 1912. The line was electrified in 1971/72. On 28 May 1972, the opening day of the Munich S-Bahn, the section of line S 1 (then running Freising-Munich-Kreuzstraße) was opened to Hohenbrunn with train and bus services continuing towards <b>Aying</b> and Kreuzstraße. On 30 September 1973, these temporary services were abandoned and the S-Bahn was extended from Hohenbrunn to Kreuzstraße.|$|E

50|$|The line {{branches}} off the Munich East-Deisenhofen railway {{between the}} stations of Giesing and Fasangarten. The section of line from Munich East {{up to this}} point {{is one of the few}} in Germany that has traffic running on the left. This feature allows S-Bahn services from Munich St. Martinstrasse to be inserted into the S-Bahn line at Munich East while simultaneously reversing to run into the S-Bahn tunnel under central Munich or vice versa. South of Ständlerstraße there is a flying junction where the two tracks change sides. At this point, the line to Kreuzstraße branches off. After a short distance with two tracks (also operated with traffic running on the left) they combine and run east towards Munich-Perlach. Here it crosses Autobahn A 8. After Perlach station the line turns southeast. The following station, Neuperlach Süd is the only one in Munich at which the U-Bahn and the S-Bahn share a platform. The station is located on a bridge over Carl-Wery-Straße. The line runs through the municipalities of Neubiberg and Ottobrunn. After crossing the Munich ring road and federal highway B 471, the line reaches Hohenbrunn station. Wächterhof station lies east of town in the woods. Höhenkirchen-Siegertsbrunn station is located approximately midway between the two now close-knit neighbourhoods. The <b>Aying</b> municipality has four stations (Dürrnhaar, <b>Aying,</b> Peiß and Großhelfendorf). After Großhelfendorf station, the line runs in a southwesterly direction to Kreuzstraße. There it meets the Mangfall Valley Railway, running from Rosenheim to Holzkirchen. Kreuzstraße station is located in the Teufelsgraben valley; when it was opened the Kreuzstraße district of Valley had only a few houses.|$|E
50|$|Höhenkirchen-Siegertsbrunn is {{a station}} on the Munich S-Bahn network on the Munich-Giesing-Kreuzstraße railway. It {{is located in the}} {{community}} of Höhenkirchen-Siegertsbrunn, south-east of Munich. It has two side-platforms with a large distance between the tracks. It is served by line S7 in a twenty-minute rhythm. A third of the outbound trains terminate here, the rest continues further to <b>Aying</b> or Kreuzstraße. Before 2005 the station had one island-platform, which was demolished after the opening of the two side-platforms in 2005. The station is staffed: tickets can be purchased at the DB store. The station factilities are: toilets, a bus stop, bicycle stands and P+R (park and ride). The station is located at the ground level so it is accessible by wheelchair. The north half of both platforms is covered by a roof. The travel time to Marienplatz is approximately 30 minutes.|$|E
50|$|In 1922 he {{set himself}} {{up as an}} {{independent}} farmer in Loibersdorf (<b>Aying),</b> between Munich and Rosenheim. In 1926 {{he took a job}} as a merchandise inspector, and in 1928 as a stud-inspector near Kassel, in Beberbeck, one of the country's leading stud centres. However, with the steady increase in mechanised agriculture and the general economic decline the stud business was itself under pressure and the principal stud at Beberbeck business went into liquidation in 1929, even though business activity did not come to an immediate halt. On 1 May 1933 Steidle joined the Nazi Party which had seized power in January 1933 and spent the intervening months consolidating its own power and banning other political parties in Germany. He lost his job in 1933 and a period of unemployment followed. He worked briefly as an insurance agent during 1934 before rejoining the army at the end of the year, recovering immediately the officer's rank that he had held when decommissioned in 1918.|$|E

Soon, things have reached a breaking point. Wei Ming is offered help from both her publisher as well as a newspaper reporter, but both make advances on her, which she rejects. Unable to pay for medicine for her child, and with no employment, Wei Ming agrees to become a prostitute. Her first client, coincidentally is Dr. Wang, who flaunts his new-found power over her. Wei, disgusted with herself, runs back to her apartment, with Dr. Wang in hot pursuit. Back in the apartment, Wang and Li come to blows with the effeminate Wang becoming quickly incapacitated.

40|$|CommentaryFor many women, {{such as the}} 1 er cent under 40 {{who have}} a remature menopause, the {{shortage}} of donated eggs for IVF causes heartache and frustration. If more donated eggs were available, these women's hopes of a family might be realised. But is <b>aying</b> women to donate eggs the solution? Egg donation is an invasive and unpleasant rocess. Even the best scientific efforts will never make it risk-free. With the removal of anonymity, {{it is not surprising}} that donation rates are so low. Of course, we need to make sure that no vulnerable woman is exploited by selling her eggs for IVF. Although the system rotects vulnerable women in Britain, it does not rotect those in other countries who are selling their eggs to reproductive tourists. Banning donor ayment may also be an overly rotectionist aproach. Well-informed women will be more than capable of weighing up the risks and benefits of donation, including the incentive of ayment. If <b>aying</b> women to donate eggs for IVF is to be reconsidered, numerous safeguards must be ut in lace. Donation must be accompanied by rigorous counselling and a compulsory "cooling off" period. There must be strict controls on advertising. We must also ensure that all other avenues, such as better resourced campaigns to recruit altruistic donors, have been exhausted.

40|$|Many {{scholars}} {{have noted the}} way that elements of the character creed of Exod. 34. 6 - 7 recur throughout {{the book of the}} Twelve. This article proposes that a passage that is overlooked in relation to this theme in the Twelve is Zech. 5. 1 - 4. This association seems to go unnoticed because of the tendency to mistranslate niqqâ in Zech. 5. 3. It should have its usual sense of ‘to be acquitted ’ or ‘to go unpunished’, which is in keeping with its meaning elsewhere and in Exod. 34. 7. The associations of the <b>Àying</b> scroll and the ‘Law of Moses ’ in the vision of Zech. 5. 1 - 4 strengthen the case for seeing an allusion to the character creed of Exodus 34. This article shows how a connection back to the theophany of glory in Exodus suits the unfolding of Zechariah’s night visions. With God’s return to Jerusalem, and the removal of the guilt of the land (Zech. 3. 9), this sixth vision declares that God will continue to act according to his name and glory and ‘will by no means acquit the guilty’...|$|E
