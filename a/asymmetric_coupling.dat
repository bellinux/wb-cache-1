40|$|A one {{dimensional}} classically chaotic spin chain with <b>asymmetric</b> <b>coupling</b> and two different inter-spin interactions, nearest neighbors and all-to-all, has been considered. Depending on the interaction range, dynamical properties, as ergodicity and chaoticity are strongly different. Indeed, even in presence of chaoticity, the model displays {{a lack of}} ergodicity only in presence of all to all interaction and below an energy threshold, that persists in the thermodynamical limit.

We mainly focused on the modeling of the transmission structures with both cases of symmetric and asymmetric geometries. We specifically designed <b>asymmetric</b> <b>coupled</b> microstrips and four-line symmetric coupled microstrips with a two-layer substrate.

40|$|International audienceUnique {{structural}} and electronic characteristics of graphene {{make it an}} attractive contact for fundamental single-molecule electrical studies. With this in mind, we have probed here the electrical conductance of a molecular junction basedon α,ω-diaminoalkane chains sandwiched between a gold and a graphene electrode. Using an STM based I(s) method combined with density functional theory-based transport calculations, we demonstrate that the resulting attenuation factor {{turns out to be}} much lower when compared to the standard molecular junction between twogold electrodes. This effect is attributed to <b>asymmetric</b> <b>coupling</b> of the molecule through strong chemisorption at the gold electrode and weaker van der Waals contact at graphene.

30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that the MFPS of complex {{dynamical}} networks with mixed time-varying and <b>asymmetric</b> <b>coupling</b> delays via new hybrid adaptive control has been studied. We will give a comprehensive study on this topic, and the main contributions of this paper lie in the following aspects. (1) The mixed time-varying delays, with discrete and distributed time-varying delays, which are considered in the dynamical nodes and in hybrid <b>asymmetric</b> <b>coupling</b> simultaneously, are different from the time-delay case in [6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 30]. (2) For the coupling matrix, we do not assume that outer coupling configuration matrix is symmetric or irreducible, which is different from coupling in [8, 16]. (3) For the control method, MFPS is studied via either hybrid adaptive control or hybrid adaptive pinning control with nonlinear and adaptive linear feedback control, which contains error linear term, time-varying delay error linear term and distributed time-varying delay error linear term. The MFPS is different from the control method in [13, 21]. In addition, the pinning nodes can be randomly selected. From the above discussions, this work is one of the first reports of such investigation to further develop the MFPS of complex dynamical networks with mixed time-varying delays in the dynamical nodes and in <b>asymmetric</b> <b>coupling</b> via hybrid adaptive control or hybrid adaptive pinning control. Based on constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the adaptive control technique, the parameter update law and the technique of dealing with some integral terms, new sufficient conditions for guaranteeing the existence of the MFPS of delayed CDNs with <b>asymmetric</b> <b>coupling</b> delays are derived. Numerical examples are included to show the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid adaptive control and hybrid adaptive pinning control scheme.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the function projective synchronization problem of neural networks with mixed time-varying delays and uncertainties <b>asymmetric</b> <b>coupling.</b> The function projective synchronization {{of this model}} via hybrid adaptive pinning controls and hybrid adaptive controls, composed of nonlinear and adaptive linear feedback control, is further investigated in this study. Based on Lyapunov stability theory combined with the method of the adaptive control and pinning control, some novel and simple sufficient conditions are derived for the function projective synchronization problem of neural networks with mixed time-varying delays and uncertainties <b>asymmetric</b> <b>coupling,</b> and the derived results are less conservative. Particularly, the control method focuses on how to determine a set of pinned nodes with fixed coupling matrices and strength values and randomly select pinning nodes.
