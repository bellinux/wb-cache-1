The thing is, we know Bruce <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he's capable of, and you think, 'Well, better the devil you know.'

[...] "We know how many possibilities there are for dimensions <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the dimensions do. None of it correlates with things like astral projection." [...] Bruce attributes astral experiences such as [...] "meetings" [...] alleged by practitioners to confirmation bias and coincidences.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2009, Josh Farro {{spoke about}} the band's next studio album. Talking to Kerrang!, Farro said: [...] "We're gonna try to [...] it in Nashville. I think writing the album there will inspire us, and then if we record there too it'll {{be a lot easier}} since we can sleep in our beds at night rather than in hotels like the other 300 days out of the year! We're not sure who's going to produce the record yet. We did [...] "Decode" [...] with [...] Rob Cavallo, which was a good experience, but we're looking around and don't want to make any {{decisions}} until {{we have a lot of}} songs <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> we're looking for. We really enjoy our live sound and we want a producer who can really capture that." [...] Paramore wrote and completed their third album Brand New Eyes in early 2009. The first single from the album was [...] "Ignorance" [...] and was released July 7, 2009. Paramore was the special guest with Bedouin Soundclash, The Sounds and Janelle Monáe at the No Doubt Summer Tour 2009, starting in May 2009 in outdoor amphitheaters and arenas across the US and Canada. The official music video for [...] "Ignorance" [...] aired on all MTV platforms, networks, and websites on August 13, 2009. Paramore, along with Paper Route and The Swellers, toured in support of Brand New Eyes in the fall of 2009. Some tour dates were postponed due to Hayley Williams becoming infected with laryngitis. [...] "Brick By Boring Brick", [...] "The Only Exception", [...] "Careful" [...] and [...] "Playing God" [...] were the album's following singles. To promote the album, the band recorded a performance for MTV Unplugged.|$|E

60|$|We {{need not}} {{debate about the}} mere words {{evolution}} or progress: personally I prefer to call it reform. For reform implies form. It implies that {{we are trying to}} shape the world in a particular image; to make it something that we see already in our minds. Evolution is a metaphor from mere automatic unrolling. Progress is a metaphor from merely walking along a road--very likely the wrong road. But reform is a metaphor for reasonable and determined men: it means that we see a certain thing out of shape and we mean to put it into shape. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> shape.|$|E
60|$|This is our God, the God of the Bible, the God of the Church, the God who has {{revealed}} himself in Jesus Christ our Lord. And him we can believe utterly, for {{we know that}} he is faithful and true; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> THAT means, if there is any truth or faithfulness in us. We know that he is just and righteous; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> THAT means, if there is any justice and uprightness in ourselves. Him we can trust utterly; to him we can take all our cares, all our sorrows, all our doubts, all our sins, and pour them out to him, because he is condescending; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> THAT means, if there be any condescension and real high-mindedness in ourselves. We can be certain too that he will hear us, just because he is so great, so majestic, so glorious; because his greatness, and majesty, and glory is a moral and spiritual greatness, which shows itself by stooping to the meanest, by listening to the most foolish, helping the weakest, pitying the worst, even while it is bound to punish. Him we can trust, I say, because him we can know, and can say of him, Let the Infinite and the Absolute mean what they may, I know in whom I have believed--God the Good. Whatever else I cannot understand, I can at least 'understand the lovingkindness of the Lord;' however high his dwelling may be, I know that he humbleth himself to behold the things in heaven and earth, to take the simple out of the dust, and the poor out of the mire. Whatever else God may or may not be, I know that gracious is the Lord, and righteous, yea, our God is merciful. The Lord preserveth the simple, for I was in misery, and he helped ME. Whatsoever fine theories or new discoveries I cannot trust, I can trust him, for with him is mercy, and with the Lord is plenteous redemption; and he shall redeem his people from all their sins. However dark and ignorant I may be, I can go to him for teaching, and say, Teach me to do the thing that pleaseth thee, for thou art my God; let thy loving Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness.|$|E

"They grew soft {{in their}} {{political}} ideas," [...] continued the unsparing critic; [...] "for the old insular belief that all foreigners were devils and rogues they substituted another belief, equally grounded on insular lack of knowledge, that most foreigners were amiable, good fellows, who only needed to be talked to and patted on the back to become your friends and benefactors. They began {{to believe that a}} foreign Minister would relinquish long-cherished schemes of national policy and hostile expansion if he came over on a holiday and was asked down to country houses and shown the tennis court and the rock-garden and the younger children. Listen. I once heard it solemnly stated at an after-dinner debate in some literary club that a certain very prominent German statesman had a daughter at school in England, and that future friendly {{relations between the two countries}} were improved in prospect, if not assured, by that circumstance. You think I am laughing; I am recording a fact, and the men present were politicians and statesmen as well as literary dilettanti. It was an insular lack of insight that worked the mischief, or some of the mischief. We, in Hungary, we live too much cheek by jowl with our racial neighbours to have many illusions about them. Austrians, Roumanians, Serbs, Italians, Czechs, we know what they think of us, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to think of them, we know what we want in the world, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they want; that knowledge does not send us flying at each other's throats, but it does keep us from growing soft.

60|$|It went on till at {{last the}} wise men decided that the girl only wanted to be {{relieved}} by her old lover, that she might take a new lover with his permission. The girl was no doubt peculiar; but, {{as far as the}} wise ones could learn from her manner,--for with words she would say nothing,--that was her state of mind. So the interview was planned,--to the infinite disgust of the Countess, who, however, believed that it might avail; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> was the result. Lady Anna, who long had doubted,--who had at last almost begun to doubt whether Daniel Thwaite was true to her,--had renewed her pledges, strengthened her former promises, and was now more firmly betrothed than ever to him whom the Countess hated as a very fiend upon earth.

Last, and absolutely unassailable proof, the sutures in my skull closed six months ahead of his. Always just that six months' difference to a day. Was that accident?

60|$|It may be {{said that}} ready money for the moment was the one desire nearest {{to the heart of}} Mollett père, when he took that last journey over the Boggeragh mountains--ready money {{wherewith}} to satisfy the pressing claims of Miss O'Dwyer, and bring back civility, or rather servility, to the face and manner of Tom the waiter at the Kanturk Hotel. Very little of that servility can be enjoyed by persons of the Mollett class when money ceases to be ready in their hands and pockets, and there is, perhaps, nothing that they enjoy so keenly as servility. Mollett père had gone down determined that that comfort should at any rate be forthcoming to him, whatever answer might be given to those other grander demands, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> success had attended his mission.
