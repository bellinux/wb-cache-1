She became a senior associate while working on Philip Morris litigation.

5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} her {{traumatic}} childhood, Sidle has demonstrated compassion and empathy for victims of domestic violence, and fury against their abusers. She also has {{a soft spot for}} animals, and became a vegetarian after she saw Grissom conduct an experiment on a dead pig. She has also shown a tendency to become very aggressive when under pressure or annoyed, especially in cases involving <b>abused</b> <b>women</b> - such as her arguments with Catherine and Ecklie, and engaging in a heated argument with a man suspected of murdering his wife. In recent years, perhaps {{because of her}} mother's schizophrenia, she has been seen to work several cases with a mental health aspect.|$|E
5|$|In the video, Candy {{is shown}} {{living with a}} cult on a farm {{populated}} by <b>abused</b> <b>women</b> and a tyrannical man. Candy and the other women are seen performing various chores around the house. The man demands that the women prepare dinner, and drags one of them outside by her hair. These opening sequences are accompanied by {{the sounds of a}} piano, the women's cooking knives, and the man's ax. The women seek vengeance against the man, removing all of their clothing, confronting him while he is chopping wood, and shooting him with golden rifles. Following the man's death, the women have dinner together while wearing latex clothing. The visual also includes scenes of Candy posing with a white horse while wearing oversized hats and holding decorated machine guns. During these scenes, Candy is shown only wearing a bodystocking, and in some instances a large chastity belt. To accommodate restrictions regarding censorship, Candy's nipples are airbrushed out of the shots.|$|E

40|$|Substance <b>abuse</b> and <b>woman</b> <b>abuse</b> {{are closely}} {{associated}} in the public’s mind, {{so much so}} that many people believe the use of substances is a direct cause of <b>woman</b> <b>abuse.</b> Others view substance use as a risk factor which, while not a direct cause, may increase the frequency or severity of <b>woman</b> <b>abuse.</b> Still others believe substance <b>abuse</b> and <b>woman</b> <b>abuse</b> are separate issues, and any apparent relationship between them is illusory. Substance abuse, as used in this paper, refers both to the abuse of alcohol or other drugs, and to dependency on alcohol or other drugs. While partner violence includes same-sex violence, this discussion of partner violence will be limited to <b>abuse</b> of <b>women</b> by their male partners or ex-partners, so the term <b>woman</b> <b>abuse</b> will be used throughout this paper...|$|R

25|$|She later met a {{representative}} from a public relations company who agreed to help Artemis with her public likeability. What Artemis {{was not aware of}} was that the company, {{with the help of the}} White Magician, had set up several battles for her with superhuman men. However, she ultimately helped downtrodden groups such as immigrant workers and <b>abused</b> <b>women.</b> Once she uncovered this truth she set about to prove herself by single-handedly taking down Boston's biggest mob boss: Julianna Sazia. Unable to capture Julianna, Artemis destroyed her army of robots and Sazia's booby-trapped mansion. Later, Artemis' arrogance gained the better of her, and she died in a battle with the White Magician who gained extreme power while accidentally being transported to hell. Thus, Queen Hippolyta's vision of Wonder Woman dying came true (Although, ironically, Diana still died for a time shortly after Artemis's death; Hippolyta had used a spell to slightly weaken Diana during the contest and her weakened strength resulted in her losing a crucial fight).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this degree project is to obtain a greater {{understanding}} of how the support for <b>abused</b> immigrant <b>women</b> is designed and if these measures respond to the women’s own wishes and needs. I also want to investigate the possible advantages and disadvantages, there are under the social ser­vi­ces and voluntary organizations (NGOs) and women themselves when it comes to spe­cific sup­port measures for immigrant women. On which basis have these support measures been designed and what experience or research starting points are based on? To what extent do they answer to women’s needs according to the staff, and to the women's own view? The study is based on qualitative data consisting of five interviews and one case report of an <b>abused</b> <b>woman.</b> The participants I interviewed were three social workers from two different de­partments in Kristianstad administrations, one coordinator from the women’s support centre in Kristianstad and one pre-school teacher from the Family house Näsby in Kristianstad and one <b>abused</b> <b>woman.</b> To contextualize the information gathered, the normalization process by Eva Lundgren and stigma theory by Goffman have been used. The empirical material from my five semi-structured interviews and the case report has been analyzed {{on the basis of the}} normalization process and stigma theory, as well as literature and expert knowledge on <b>abused</b> immigrant <b>women.</b> Through this study I have come to the conclusion that the support measures to an <b>abused</b> immigrant <b>women</b> was based on her own needs. I have also noticed in my results that the professionals have different work procedures and different ways to refute <b>abused</b> immigrant <b>women</b> depending on their knowledge of other countries’ culture. ...|$|R

Delegates from over 180countries heard her say: [...] "If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights, once and for all." [...] In doing so, she resisted both internal administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks. The speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later women around the world would recite Clinton's key phrases. She {{was one of the most}} prominent international figures during the late 1990s to speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban. She helped create Vital Voices, an international initiative sponsored by the U.S. to encourage the participation of women in the political processes of their countries.

The eleven complained of the Church's divisive tactics, which they said were intended to isolate Hussey and Ferraro. Signer Maureen Fiedler said, [...] "I have never retracted or recanted one syllable of the Catholic Statement on Abortion and Pluralism.
