5|$|Aside {{from the}} usual {{tactical}} aspects of racing, Wipeout 2097 (unlike its predecessor) offered the chance to eliminate other drivers from the competition by destroying their craft with weapons. Each craft has a shield energy quota, and when this quota reaches zero—either from damage sustained from weapon attacks, or impact from other craft or {{the edges of the}} circuit—the craft blows up. The craft also blows up if the time limit is reached, though this only applies to human players. The biggest weapon introduced in 2097 was the Quake Disruptor, which has been a series hallmark ever since. This weapon causes a quake to thrust <b>a</b> <b>destructive</b> wave down the track that dunks the crafts it smash into.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Carmen was {{the most}} intense {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1974 Atlantic hurricane season. <b>A</b> <b>destructive</b> and widespread storm, Carmen originated as a tropical disturbance that emerged from Africa {{toward the end of}} August. The disturbance traveled westward, spawning a tropical depression east of the Lesser Antilles on August29. The storm moved through the Caribbean Sea, and in an environment conducive to intensification, it quickly strengthened to its initial peak intensity as a Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Carmen moved ashore on the Yucatán Peninsula, where, despite striking a sparsely populated region, it caused significant crop damage and killed several people. Before the storm's arrival, officials had set up several evacuation centers, and many residents had moved to higher ground.|$|E
5|$|In March 1942, Bush sent {{a report}} to Roosevelt {{outlining}} work by Robert Oppenheimer on the nuclear cross section of uranium-235. Oppenheimer's calculations, which Bush had George Kistiakowsky check, estimated that the critical mass of a sphere of uranium-235 was {{in the range of}} 2.5 to 5 kilograms, with <b>a</b> <b>destructive</b> power of around 2,000 tons of TNT. Moreover, it appeared that plutonium might be even more fissile. After conferring with Brigadier General Lucius D. Clay about the construction requirements, Bush drew up a submission for $85 million in fiscal year 1943 for four pilot plants, which he forwarded to Roosevelt on June 17, 1942. With the Army on board, Bush moved to streamline oversight of the project by the OSRD, replacing the S-1 Section with a new S-1 Executive Committee.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this moment}} that the timely arrival of the Dutch General Chassé turned the tide in favour of the Anglo-allied army.Chassé's {{relatively}} fresh Dutch division was sent against them, led by a battery of Dutch horse-artillery commanded by Captain Krahmer de Bichin. The battery opened <b>a</b> <b>destructive</b> fire into the 1st/3rd Grenadiers' flank. This still did not stop the Guard's advance, so Chassé ordered his first brigade (Colonel Hendrik Detmers) to charge the outnumbered French with the bayonet; the French grenadiers then faltered and broke. The 4th Grenadiers, seeing their comrades retreat and having suffered heavy casualties themselves, now wheeled right about and retired.|$|E

5|$|On 9 April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark, occupying Aarhus the {{following}} day and 5 years hence. The occupation was <b>a</b> <b>destructive</b> period with major disasters, loss of life and economic depression. The Port of Aarhus became a hub for supplies to the Baltics and Norway while the surrounding rail network supplied the Atlantic Wall in west Jutland and cargo headed for Germany. Combined, these factors resulted in a strong German presence, especially in 1944–45. The first years were peaceful {{in conjunction with the}} policies of the Danish Protectorate Government, but following the enactment of the Communist Law in August 1941, the first armed resistance and sabotage commenced, gradually growing in intensity over the years with repression and terror in response.|$|E
5|$|Racer's {{hurricane}} was <b>a</b> <b>destructive</b> {{tropical cyclone}} that had severe effects on northeastern Mexico and the Gulf Coast of the United States in early October1837. It takes {{its name from}} the Royal Navy ship Racer, which sustained some damage when it encountered the hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. The storm first affected Jamaica with flooding rainfall and strong winds on September26 and27, before entering the Gulf of Mexico by October1. As the hurricane approached northern Tamaulipas and southern Texas, it slowed to a crawl and turned sharply eastward. The storm battered the GulfCoast from Texas to the Florida Panhandle between October3 and7, and after crossing the Southeastern United States, it emerged into the Atlantic shipping lanes off the Carolinas. For most of the storm's duration, the strongest winds and heaviest rains were confined to the northern side of its track.|$|E
5|$|Saruman {{makes his}} final {{appearance}} {{at the end of}} the last volume, The Return of the King (1955), after Sauron's defeat. After persuading the Ents to release him from Orthanc, he travels north on foot, apparently reduced to begging. He is accompanied by Wormtongue, whom he beats and curses. When they reach the Shire, Saruman's agents—both Hobbits and Men—have already taken it over and started <b>a</b> <b>destructive</b> process of industrialization. Saruman governs the Shire in secret under the name of Sharkey until the events of chapter 8 ("The Scouring of the Shire") in which Frodo and his companions return and lead a rebellion, defeating the intruders and exposing Saruman's role. Even after Saruman attempts to stab Frodo, Frodo lets him go. When Saruman blames Wormtongue for the damage done to the Shire and curses him, Wormtongue finally snaps and slits his master's throat.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} beetle have evolved {{immunity}} to insecticides. For example, the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is <b>a</b> <b>destructive</b> pest of potato plants. Its hosts include {{other members of}} the Solanaceae, such as nightshade, tomato, eggplant and capsicum, as well as the potato. Different populations have between them developed resistance to all major classes of insecticide. The Colorado potato beetle was evaluated as a tool of entomological warfare during World War II, the idea being to use the beetle and its larvae to damage the crops of enemy nations. Germany tested its Colorado potato beetle weaponisation program south of Frankfurt, releasing 54,000 beetles.|$|E
5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is <b>a</b> <b>destructive</b> {{force that}} seeks only to acquire power unless {{tempered}} by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never giving in to her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores the irony of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Nancy, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Weling, was <b>a</b> <b>destructive</b> typhoon that moved through Vietnam and the Philippines during October 1982. The typhoon {{originated}} from an area of convection and was first classified as a tropical cyclone on October10. The system attained gale-force winds the next day, and slowly deepened thereafter. Although Nancy initially moved west, the system maintained a general westward course for much of its duration, striking Luzon on October14 at peak intensity of 215km/h (130mph). It weakened to tropical storm strength overland, but re-intensified to typhoon intensity over the South China Sea. Nancy hit northern Vietnam on the October18, and weakened almost immediately thereafter, before dissipating on October20 inland over Vietnam.|$|E
