His best memory of these schooldays is of a teacher who introduced him to the works of Pieter Brueghel. Outside school, {{he spent most of his}} time with comic magazines and adventure books by Jules Verne or books about Nick Carter and Buffalo Bill. At 13, he enrolled at the Academie voor Schone Kunsten in Antwerp to study sculpture, and two years later he started working as sculptor and decorator, just like his father.|$|E

25|$|Hemingway's Boat: Everything He Loved in Life, and Lost, 1934-1961 (2011) was {{published}} by Knopf. While Hendrickson reportedly spent seven years writing the book, he began informal research in 1980, when he met Ernest Hemingway's younger brother, Leicester on a seaplane flight to the Bahamas. During their vacation in the Caribbean, Hendrickson {{and his wife had}} the opportunity to spend time with Leicester Hemingway, while researching <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> the life of the deceased author. Seven years later, while Hendrickson was at The Washington Post, he began an in-depth two-part series for the newspaper, which focused on the lives of author Hemingway's three children. Based on his 1980 Bahamas research and personal encounter with Leicester, along with the Hemingway series for the Post, Hendrickson eventually began writing his book.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} WFF {{was home to}} the NSIP Sub-SEM and SEM projects. NSIP stands for the NASA Student Involvement Project, the Sub-SEM project was to design one of four {{experiments}} that would be inserted into an ORION-II one-stage rocket and launched above 98 percent of the atmosphere, and experience over 30 Gs of centrifugal force, while SEM was to design an experiment that would be flown on a future Space Shuttle mission. Each project gave 16 students and four teachers (four students and one teacher from each high school) the opportunity to spend an almost all-expense-paid week at WFF. Normally the students and teachers stayed in the Mariner Motel, now a Holiday Inn, conducting experiments <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> the facility. Following the presidential mandate and budget cuts the entire NSIP program, SEM and Sub-SEM included, was shut down.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Milo J. Thatch was originally {{supposed to be}} a descendant of Edward Teach, otherwise known as Blackbeard the pirate. The directors later related him to an explorer so he would discover his inner talent for exploration. The {{character of}} Molière was originally intended to be [...] "professorial" [...] but Chris Ure, a story artist, changed the concept to that of a [...] "horrible little burrowing creature with a wacky coat and strange headgear with extending eyeballs", said Wise. Don Hahn pointed out that the absence of songs presented a challenge for a team accustomed to animating musicals, as solely action scenes would have to carry the film. Kirk Wise said it gave the team an opportunity for more on-screen character development: [...] "We had more screen time available to do a scene like where Milo and the explorers are camping out <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> one another's histories. An entire sequence is devoted to having dinner and going to bed. That is not typically something we would have the luxury of doing." ...|$|E
500|$|By his own account, Döblin wrote Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine [...] "in one go" [...] from August to December 1914, {{at which}} time he had to begin work as a {{military}} doctor near the western front in Sarreguemines. While he had originally conceived of the work as a three-stage narrative about the progress of modern technology (represented by the steam engine, the steam turbine, and the oil motor), his planned sequel, Der Ölmotor (The Oil Motor), never came to fruition. He conducted extensive research for the novel, spending time in the facilities of AEG <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> the construction of machines, turbines, and motors. [...] Döblin submitted the draft to rigorous stylistic overhaul during the war years, shortening the novel considerably and radicalizing the syntax. The novel was published in May 1918 by Fischer Verlag and was not reprinted until a critical edition, based on {{the text of the}} first edition with minor corrections drawn from the manuscript and typescript, was published by Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag in 1987. The original manuscript and subsequent typescript are preserved in the German Literary Archive in Marbach. As of 2016, no English translation is available.|$|E
500|$|Milian wrote So Amazin {{based on}} her own life, and each record pertained to a {{different}} aspect, especially focused on relationships. During early production of the album, Milian was dealing with her break-up with actor Nick Cannon and wrote several records based on that. While writing the mid-tempo track [...] "My Lovin' Goes", Milian felt she turned a new leaf. She said, [...] "you see the change in So Amazin where life was just really coming into place. I was finally becoming the woman that I feel that I am right now. Also, I was leaving old love behind <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> new types of love. Which is great, whether it be life, and also the dating scene is really nice." [...] Two tracks which Milian wrote about Cannon were [...] "Gonna Tell Everybody" [...] and [...] "Who's Gonna Ride". When Milian and Cool & Dre had discussions, her break-up with Cannon was regularly mentioned. Milian felt a need to express herself, and writing became therapeutic for Milian; {{she was able to}} get through the break-up by writing songs. The production by Cool & Dre also inspired Milian to write the tracks, as she felt comfortable with them and was able to be open.|$|E
