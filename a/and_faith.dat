5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Wijnhamer, known as PahWongso, was {{recognised}} in West Java for his promotion of social causes. These included promoting monogamy <b>and</b> <b>faith</b> in western medicine, {{as well as}} combating gambling {{and the use of}} opium and alcohol. In conveying his messages he often used the Sundanese wayang golek (a form of rod puppet), as the local people were generally unable to read. He was able to speak Dutch, Malay, and Javanese fluently, and had some command of Chinese and Japanese. This social work was funded predominantly from PahWongso's day job, selling fried peanuts (kacang goreng).|$|E

5|$|Gandhi first {{proposed}} a flag to the Indian National Congress in 1921. The flag {{was designed by}} Pingali Venkayya.

The design was then modified to include a white stripe in the centre for other religious communities, and provide a background for the spinning wheel. Subsequently, to avoid sectarian associations with the colour scheme, saffron, white and green were chosen for the three bands, representing courage and sacrifice, peace and truth, <b>and</b> <b>faith</b> and chivalry respectively.|$|E

5|$|Some {{essential}} {{features of}} Modernisme were: an anticlassical language inherited from Romanticism with {{a tendency to}} lyricism and subjectivity; the determined connection of architecture with the applied arts and artistic work that produced an overtly ornamental style; the use of new materials from which emerged a mixed constructional language, rich in contrasts, that sought a plastic effect for the whole; {{a strong sense of}} optimism <b>and</b> <b>faith</b> in progress that produced an emphatic art that reflected the atmosphere of prosperity of the time, above all of the esthetic of the bourgeoisie.|$|E

5|$|What had {{appeared}} at the outset to be a brief and straightforward military intervention led to a full-scale war in South America's southeast. However, {{the possibility of a}} two-front conflict (with Britain and Paraguay) faded when, in September 1865, the British government sent an envoy who publicly apologized for the crisis between the empires.
