5|$|After deliberating {{for five}} days the jury found Massino guilty of all eleven counts on July 30, 2004. His {{sentencing}} was initially scheduled for October 12, and {{he was expected to}} receive <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> life imprisonment with no possibility of parole.

5|$|In 2006 {{a private}} {{security}} guard {{with a pistol}} pursued on foot two men whom he believed tried to steal scrap metal. The men climbed on a railway embankment and started throwing rocks down at the guard who thereafter shot ten rounds in their direction, mortally wounding {{one of them in}} the head. The guard was first convicted of murder by the Municipal Court in Prague and given <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> 7 years imprisonment. The decision was changed by the High Court in Prague to conviction of intentional infliction of bodily harm resulting in death (i.e. manslaughter) and <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> five years imprisonment. The guard was finally exonerated by the Supreme Court in Brno which considered his action legitimate self-defense, noting that defense must be clearly more intensive than attack in order to be successful, and that the stones and bricks being thrown presented grave danger to the man's life.|$|E

5|$|After the war, on 18 March 1946, the 'double tenth' {{war crimes}} trial {{was held in}} the Supreme Court Building, before a {{military}} court presided over by Lieutenant Colonel S. C. Silkin. Twenty-one Kempeitai were accused of torturing 57 internees, resulting in the deaths of 15. On 15 April 1946, after a hearing lasting 21days, Sumida was one of eight sentenced to death by hanging. Three others received life imprisonment, one <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> fifteen years, and two were given prison terms of eight years. Seven were acquitted.|$|E
5|$|During {{protracted}} enquiries {{before the}} case {{went to court}} in 1871, details emerged suggesting that the Claimant might be Arthur Orton, a butcher's son from Wapping in London, {{who had gone to}} sea as a boy and had last been heard of in Australia. After a civil court had rejected the Claimant's case, he was charged with perjury; while awaiting trial he campaigned throughout the country to gain popular support. In 1874, a criminal court jury decided that he was not Roger Tichborne and declared him to be Arthur Orton. Before passing <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> 14 years, the judge condemned the behaviour of the Claimant's counsel, Edward Kenealy, who was subsequently disbarred because of his conduct.|$|E

A January 1962 trial on charges of murdering her husband ended in {{conviction}} and <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> life in prison, but the verdict was overturned because of procedural irregularities. The case went to a second trial, which ended within days in a mistrial. A third trial on the charge of murdering her husband ended in a hung jury in July 1964. Kinne was released on bond following the third trial and subsequently traveled to Mexico before a scheduled fourth trial could be held in October 1964.|$|E
5|$|On 19 September 2007, {{a federal}} {{complaint}} was issued against Hsu by the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. The complaint alleges that Hsu's investment offerings were a Ponzi scheme that paid early investors with {{money that was}} contributed by later investors, that Hsu pressured investors to contribute to candidates for office, providing them {{with a list of}} candidates to choose from and that Hsu reimbursed some contributors to candidates for office in the amount of their contributions.

5|$|Croitoru had {{a history}} of run-ins with the police. Many of his legal {{problems}} came while he was president of the Hamilton, Ontario chapter of the Satan's Choice Outlaw motorcycle club. He was arrested for trafficking cocaine and served ten months in prison. Soon after, he was convicted of assault and was given <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> seven months. He encountered more problems on December 15, 1996 when he and several friends from Satan's Choice were kicked out of a strip club for wearing their gang's colors. To get revenge, Croitoru and his friends planned to blow up the strip club. They changed their minds, however, and decided to bomb the local police station instead. The bomb caused $133,000 in damages to the Sudbury, Ontario police station and a nearby bank and injured a police officer. Croitoru and two friends were arrested and charged, but the trial did not begin until almost two years later.|$|E
5|$|For the 1981–82 season, Nea Salamina {{acquired}} foreign footballers for {{the first}} time, Bulgarians Nazca Michailiof and Stefan Pavlov. An unprecedented incident occurred during the 1982–83 season when, {{in a game against}} Enosis Neon Paralimni FC in GSZ Stadium, three Nea Salamina's players were expelled and the remaining players surrounded the linesman to protest. The linesman, claiming to have received blows, was transported to the hospital where radiographs failed to show injuries caused by the players. After the linesman made a formal complaint, a court imposed <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> 45 days. This was unprecedented for Cypriot football. The players remained in jail for five days and were released after public outcry, but then CFA authorities imposed crippling sanctions on them, ordering them to stay off the court for several months.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Collins' husband, Bill, {{was charged}} in an influence-peddling scandal. The {{prosecution}} claimed that while Collins was governor, Dr. Collins exploited {{a perception that}} he could influence the awarding of state contracts through his wife. It was alleged that he exploited this perception to pressure people who did business with the state to invest nearly $2million with him. He was convicted on October 14, 1993, after a seven-week trial; he was given <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> five years and three months in federal prison, which was {{at the low end}} of the range prescribed by the federal sentencing guidelines. He was also fined $20,000 for a conspiracy charge that involved kickbacks disguised as political contributions. Governor Collins was called to testify in the trial, but was not charged. The scandal tarnished her image, however, and may have cost her an appointment in the administration of President Bill Clinton. Collins was also rumored to be considering running for the U.S. Senate, a bid which never materialized following her husband's conviction. The Collinses reunited following Dr. Collins' release from prison on October 10, 1997.|$|E

5|$|In Canada, the Supreme Court held in Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer) (2002), that a {{statutory}} provision prohibiting prisoners serving <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> {{two years or}} more from voting unjustifiably infringed the fundamental right to vote guaranteed by section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court noted that the Government could not demonstrate how denying prisoners the vote helped the stated aims of the relevant statute; a democracy built on inclusiveness, democracy and citizen participation cannot be party to a law that disenfranchises a considerable part of the population. There was also no credible theory why prisoners should be {{denied the right to}} vote as a form of punishment, as it is arbitrary and not related to the offender's criminal act nor does it deter crime or rehabilitate criminals.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June 2010, Van der Sloot {{reportedly}} {{confessed to}} killing Flores, {{after hours of}} interrogation. He initially proclaimed his innocence. According to an expert in Peruvian law, the confession fit a defense strategy {{of trying to get}} the charge reduced to manslaughter, which is punishable by 6 to 20 years in prison, while a conviction for murder could result in up to 35 years' imprisonment. The prosecution was seeking <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> 30 years. Peru does not issue life sentences in standard cases of murder and has abolished capital punishment in all but exceptional circumstances, such as crimes committed under military law. A life sentence can be issued for a murder committed during the commission of a robbery. Peruvian president Alan García Pérez used the case to seek the reinstatement of the death penalty for murder.|$|E
5|$|On 8 December 2006, Ao {{was arrested}} {{based on a}} case built by the Macau Commission Against Corruption, making him the highest-ranking {{official}} arrested {{in the history of}} Macau.

5|$|After {{four minutes}} of deliberation, the jury's foreman {{announced}} a guilty verdict and <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> death. The trial lasted about one hour. Court officers approached Washington to escort him away, but were pushed aside by {{a surge of}} spectators, who seized Washington and dragged him outside. Washington initially fought back, biting one man, but was soon beaten. A chain was placed {{around his neck and}} he was dragged toward city hall by a growing mob; on the way downtown, he was stripped, stabbed, and repeatedly beaten with blunt objects. By the time he arrived at city hall, a group had prepared wood for a bonfire next to a tree in front of the building. Washington, semiconscious and covered in blood, was doused with oil, hung from the tree by a chain, and then lowered to the ground. Members of the crowd cut off his fingers, toes, and genitals. The fire was lit and Washington was repeatedly raised and lowered into the flames until he burned to death. German scholar Manfred Berg posits that the executioners attempted to keep him alive to increase his suffering. Washington attempted to climb the chain, but was unable to, owing to his lack of fingers. The fire was extinguished after two hours, allowing bystanders to collect souvenirs from the site of the lynching, including Washington's bones and links of the chain. One attendee kept part of Washington's genitalia; a group of children snapped the teeth out of Washington's head to sell as souvenirs. By the time that the fire was extinguished, parts of Washington's arms and legs had been burned off and his torso and head were charred. His body was removed from the tree and dragged behind a horse throughout the town. Washington's remains were transported to Robinson, where they were publicly displayed until a constable obtained the body late in the day and buried it.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the public}} {{prosecution}} {{department of the}} city of Augsburg obtained the calendars of Karlheinz Schreiber, a German arms dealer. With the help of the documents, the persecutors were able to decipher a code of aliases and money movements, leading to Kiep. On 4 November 1999, the prosecution office issued an arrest warrant against Kiep, charging him with having accepted a payment of one million Deutsche Marks from Schreiber in 1991 without subjecting the money to taxes. After turning himself in a day later, Kiep declared during his interrogation that he had accepted the money, with Horst Weyrauch present, as a donation for the CDU. This started the CDU donations scandal, in which a system of illegal accounts was uncovered. On 30 November, former chancellor Helmut Kohl took full responsibility for the accounts and later admitted to having personally accepted a total sum of up to two million Deutsche Marks from anonymous sponsors, which were not declared. As a consequence of the illegal proceedings, the CDU was sentenced to a payment of 41 million Deutsche Marks by President of the Bundestag Wolfgang Thierse on 15 February 2000. Kiep was ultimately involved in several lawsuits concerning tax evasion. One was closed in January 2004, after Kiep paid a monetary condition of 75,000 Euro. In another trial in 2001, he was sentenced to pay 45,000 Deutsche Marks. In early 2004, Kiep accepted <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> 40,500 Euro for a false statement given at the enquiry commission on the donations scandal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} {{elections}} of 1967, Reddy {{was elected to}} the Lok Sabha from Hindupur in Andhra Pradesh. On 17 March 1967, Reddy was elected Speaker of the Fourth Lok Sabha becoming only the third person to be elected Speaker of the house during their inaugural term. To emphasize the independence of the Speaker's office, Reddy resigned from the Congress Party. His term as Speaker was marked by several firsts including the admission of a No-Confidence Motion on the same day as the President's address to a joint session of Parliament, the handing down of <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>of</b> imprisonment for Contempt {{of the house and the}} setting up of the Committee on the Welfare of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. During his term as Speaker a defamation suit filed against him by an MP resulted in the Supreme Court's ruling that parliamentarians had complete freedom of speech in the House and that the courts had no say in such matters. Reddy described his role as being the 'watchman of the Parliament'. He however had several hostile encounters with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the House that proved costly when he became, two years later, the Congress Party's nominee to succeed Zakir Hussain as President.|$|E
