5|$|Construction of the Tu-80 {{began in}} November 1948, using as many Tu-4 {{components}} {{as possible to}} speed up construction, but the first flight was not until 1 December 1949, after the Council of Ministers had canceled the program on 16 September 1949 {{in favor of the}} Tu-85 which was expected to have much better performance. The Tu-80 became a research <b>aircraft,</b> <b>testing</b> reversible-pitch propellers and structural deformation in heavy aircraft. It eventually became a target on a bombing and gunnery range.|$|E

25|$|The {{competing}} bids {{were evaluated by}} the Air Corps in April 1936. Vought offered to sell V-141s at a unit price of $34,148 for a batch of 25 aircraft (excluding engines and Government provided equipment), reducing to $16,041 for a batch of 200 <b>aircraft.</b> <b>Testing</b> showed that the V-141 still had poor handling and was prone to spinning, and also suffered from tail flutter, leading to the Vought design being rejected. The primary winner of the competition was Seversky, with 77 P-35s being ordered.|$|E
25|$|The WASPs flew {{all types}} of {{military}} aircraft, including AT-6 Texan, AT-10 Wichita, AT-11 Kansan, and BT-13 Valiant trainers; C-47 Skytrain, C-54 Skymaster, and C-60 Lodestar transports; A-25 Shrike (SB2C Helldiver) and A-26 Invader attack aircraft; B-24 Liberator, B-25 Mitchell, TB-26 Marauder, and B-29 Superfortress bombers; P-38 Lightning, P-40 Warhawk, P-47 Thunderbolt, and P-51 Mustang fighters. In addition to ferrying, the WASPs performed many other tasks such as glider and target towing, radar calibration flights, <b>aircraft</b> <b>testing,</b> and other noncombat duties to release male pilots for overseas action. The WASPs flew approximately 60 million miles and suffered 38 fatalities, or 1 to about 16,000 hours of flying.|$|E

[...] In the fall of 1944, Eighth Air Force ran tests to determine how well conventional fighters stood up against jets. [...] The results were obvious. [...] Also, in October 1944, a small detachment arrived at the base for experimental work in rocket firing and achieved much success that they remained though most of 1945.|$|E

2500|$|Townsend transitioned to the B-52 program, an {{aircraft}} General Nathan Twining called [...] "the long rifle {{of the air}} age." [...] He participated with contractor pilots in Phase I and conducted Phases II and IV. At the time, the Air Force divided <b>aircraft</b> <b>testing</b> into seven numbered phases including: Phase 1, to determine contractor compliance with the aircraft held to 80% of design limits; Phase II, similar to Phase I but performed by Air Force pilots; and Phase IV, performance and stability testing that expanded the flight envelope to 100% of design limits.|$|E
2500|$|The Blackburn B-2 was {{developed}} by Blackburn as a successor for its earlier Bluebird IV trainer, retaining the layout and side-by-side seating of the earlier aircraft, but having a semi-monocoque all-metal fuselage, instead of the metal and fabric-covered fuselage used by the earlier aircraft. The single-bay biplane wings were of similar structure {{to those of the}} Bluebird IV and could be folded for easy storage. Leading edge slots were fitted to the upper wing to improve low-speed handling, with ailerons on the lower wings only. The conventional landing gear was fixed, with the mainwheels supported on telescopic legs and a spung tailskid. The prototype B-2 (registered G-ABUW) first flew on 10 December 1932, powered by a [...] de Havilland Gipsy III engine, although the [...] de Havilland Gipsy Major and 120hp Cirrus Hermes IV engines were also fitted to production <b>aircraft.</b> <b>Testing</b> proved successful, with the aircraft proving to be very manoeuvrable, and the first production aircraft flew in 1932.|$|E
2500|$|World War II {{showed the}} need for a proving ground for {{aircraft}} armament at Eglin. In May 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt transmitted to congress a letter, with his approval, from Budget Director Harold D. Smith, asking an appropriation of $76, 750 to purchase 24,111 acres of private land within the Choctawhatchee National Forest boundary. The U.S. Forestry ceded to the War Department the Choctawhatchee National Forest on 18 October 1940. Hunters had to be reminded regularly that the base reservation was now off-limits in 1941–1942 and there was some local resentment at the handover. On 15 May 1941, the Air Corps Proving Ground (later the Air Proving Ground Command, on 1 April 1942) was activated, and Eglin became the site for gunnery training for Army Air Forces fighter pilots, as well as for <b>aircraft</b> <b>testing.</b> The 23rd Composite Group moved from Orlando to Eglin Field, 1 July 1941. [...] It comprised the 1st Pursuit Squadron, the 54th Bombardment Squadron (M), the 24th Bombardment Squadron (L), the 54th School Squadron, the 61st Air Base Group, and the 3rd Gunnery and Bombing Range Detachment.|$|E
