5|$|When Alpha {{came within}} the Doppler weather radar range of Puerto Rico, the radar {{suggested}} that an eyewall-like feature had developed. <b>Alpha</b> <b>was</b> tracking along the southwest {{edge of a}} subtropical ridge. With nearby Hurricane Wilma's large circulation, <b>Alpha</b> <b>was</b> experiencing strong southerly flow from Wilma. Alpha, with its small circulation, was then faced with the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola, which led forecasters to believe <b>Alpha</b> <b>was</b> soon to dissipate. Shortly after Alpha reached its peak intensity on October23 its wind decreased. While convection remained in bands, the low level circulation was disrupted by land. This left the center ill-defined and difficult to locate.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} it was thought that <b>Alpha</b> <b>was</b> the twenty-second storm of the season, and so was the storm which broke the 1933 season's record for most storms in a single season. However post-season {{analysis}} revealed that there was also a previously unnoticed subtropical storm on October4, which made Alpha the twenty-third storm of the season. <b>Alpha</b> <b>was</b> the first tropical storm to be assigned a Greek-alphabet name after the list of hurricane names was exhausted.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm <b>Alpha</b> <b>was</b> the twenty-third named {{storm of}} the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season. The twenty-one names from the predetermined A–W list having been used, <b>Alpha</b> <b>was</b> the first tropical storm {{ever to be}} given a name from the Greek alphabet. On October20, Tropical Depression Twenty-five formed from a tropical wave near the Windward Islands. It became a tropical storm on October23, and reached its peak intensity but weakened again before making landfall in the Dominican Republic that afternoon. Crossing the island of Hispaniola it weakened to a tropical depression, and persisted until October24, when it dissipated. Its remnant low was absorbed by Hurricane Wilma's large circulation.|$|E

5|$|On {{its first}} advisory, there was {{disagreement}} among forecast models regarding its eventual track, with projected tracks deviating from a Georgia landfall to a track northeastward out to sea. <b>Alpha</b> <b>was</b> also a climatological outlier at the time; the NHC HURRAN model, {{which was based}} on previous storms with similar characteristics, found no analogs for the storm. Subtropical Storm <b>Alpha</b> <b>was</b> initially well-defined as it moved southwestward. The very small center was located along {{the eastern edge of the}} convection, while low-level cloud bands formed east of the center. At the time, the temperature structure was more typical of a winter storm, although it was expected to become more like a subtropical storm typical during the summer months. The winds decreased steadily as it turned more westward on May 27, and the heavy rainfall persisted mostly to the north and west of the center.|$|E
5|$|The {{sorority}} {{was founded}} on January 15, 1908, at the historically black Howard University in Washington, D.C., {{by a group of}} sixteen students led by Ethel Hedgeman Lyle.

5|$|It {{was during}} the first half of the twentieth century that the first women's fraternities were established. The {{university}} first admitted women to graduate programs in 1920, although undergraduate women were not allowed at the university until much later. With these graduate women came several female Greek organizations, referred to alternately as sororities or women's fraternities. The first sorority to establish a chapter at the university was Chi Omega, whose chapter was founded in 1927. A Kappa Delta chapter followed in 1932, and a chapter of Zeta Tau <b>Alpha</b> <b>was</b> established twenty years later in 1952.|$|E
40|$|Alpha, an {{important}} parameter in dynamo theory, {{is proportional to}} either the kinetic, current, magnetic, or velocity helicity of the fluctuating magnetic field and fluctuating velocity field.

5|$|Led by incorporator Norma Elizabeth Boyd, the {{sorority}} {{created the}} National Non-Partisan Lobby on Civil and Democratic Rights (NPC) in 1938, later renamed the National Non-Partisan Council on Public Affairs. It {{was the first}} full-time congressional lobby for minority group civil rights. Throughout the organization's life, the Non-Partisan Council worked with the NAACP, National Urban League, The United Office and Professional Workers of America, The National Association of Graduate Nurses, the American Federation of Churches, the Colored Women's Club, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Auxiliary, and the New York Voter's League. The NPC was dissolved on July 15, 1948, by twelfth Supreme Basileus Edna Over Gray-Campbell.
