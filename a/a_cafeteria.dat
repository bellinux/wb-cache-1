5|$|The {{building}} underwent {{some minor}} alterations during its 50 years of {{use by the}} Federal Reserve, consisting mostly of routine maintenance and upgrades. In 1958, the exterior was cleaned and waterproofed at the recommendation of architect William J. Bain, resulting in the discoloring of the limestone cladding. In the 1980s, the building's roof and windows were replaced {{under the direction of}} HNTB. Portions of the building were renovated in the 1990s to add new employee amenities, including <b>a</b> <b>cafeteria</b> and conference room.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, Louisville Public Schools {{announced}} {{a plan to}} merge Manual and its rival Male High School into Louisville Boys High so that the two schools could share a new $300,000 facility. The plan took effect in 1915. Industrial training classes continued at the old Manual building. Parents objected to their children having to travel between the two buildings and the consolidation did not save the school board any money, so they voted to end the experiment in 1919. The new building became Male's home for the next 70 years and Manual returned to its old building at Brook and Oak. In 1923 an expansion added new laboratories, <b>a</b> <b>cafeteria,</b> and the largest gym ever built in Louisville at the time. The addition eventually burned {{and had to be}} destroyed in 1991.|$|E
5|$|In large cities, a {{majority}} of working people and students eat their lunch at a corporate or school cafeteria, which normally serve complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own lunch food. For companies that do not operate <b>a</b> <b>cafeteria,</b> it is mandatory for white-collar workers to be given lunch vouchers {{as part of their}} employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and traiteurs; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among blue-collar workers, eating sandwiches followed with a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets for budget prices.|$|E

5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{site was}} found at 1601 W. First Street that had originally been constructed to house the Bonebrake Seminary. It was a three-story brick building built in 1879, and owned by the Dayton Board of Education, which {{used it as a}} warehouse. Monsanto leased the site on 15 October 1943, and began converting it into a laboratory known as Unit III. New heating and lighting were installed, windows were replaced, new flooring was laid, and some rooms were re-plastered. A pair of guard houses known as buildings J and K were added, as was a chemical storage shed known as building F, and a wire fence. Laboratory activities were transferred there from Unit I on 25 September. In May 1945, five additional temporary buildings were constructed on land leased from the Board of Education that housed offices, <b>a</b> <b>cafeteria,</b> locker rooms, a physics laboratory and a laundry.

Berry worked to create a complaint procedure for employees who experience discrimination because of their sexual orientation, to expand relocation benefits and counseling services to domestic partners of employees, to establish a liaison to gay and lesbian workers, and to eliminate discriminatory provisions of the National Park Service's law enforcement standards.
