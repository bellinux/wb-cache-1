25|$|Dr. Anthony Lapalla, <b>a</b> <b>psychologist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Federal Correctional Institution in Texarkana, {{believed}} {{the killer was}} planning to continue to make unexpected attacks {{such as that of}} Virgil Starks on the outskirts of town. He also believed that the same person committed the murders of Virgil Starks, Betty Jo Booker, Paul Martin, Polly Ann Moore and Richard Griffin. He also {{believed the}} killer was between the ages of middle 30s to 50 years old. He said that the killer was apparently motivated by a strong sex drive and that he was a sadist. He said that a person who would commit such crimes is intelligent, clever, shrewd and often not apprehended. According to Lapalla's theories, the killer knew at all times what was being done in the investigation and knew that the lonesome roads were being patrolled, which is why he chose the house on the farmland. He pointed out that his statements were surmised theories that were based on {{a large number of people}} who have committed similar crimes. He said in many cases the killer is never apprehended and in some instances he will divert attention to other distant communities where it is believed the crimes are committed by a different individual or else he will overcome the desire to kill and assault women.|$|E

500|$|When Philomena Goins Doctor {{found out}} what her son had done, she became enraged and {{threatened}} to disown him, shook him, then slapped him. A year later, Moore took the story to CBS' 60 Minutes, and was the background reporter on a piece produced by Joel Bernstein and narrated by African-American journalist Ed Bradley. Philomena Doctor called her family members and declared Moore's story and Bradley's television exposé were full of lies. <b>A</b> <b>psychologist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Florida later testified in state hearings that the survivors of Rosewood showed signs of posttraumatic stress disorder, made worse by the secrecy. Many years after the incident, they exhibited fear, denial, and hypervigilance about socializing with whites—which they expressed specifically regarding their children, interspersed with bouts of apathy. Despite such characteristics, survivors counted religious faith as integral to their lives following the attack in Rosewood, {{to keep them from}} becoming bitter. [...] Michael D'Orso, who wrote a book about Rosewood, said, [...] "veryone told me in their own way, in their own words, that if they allowed themselves to be bitter, to hate, it would have eaten them up." [...] Robie Mortin described her past this way: [...] "I knew that something went very wrong in my life because it took a lot away from me. But I wasn't angry or anything." ...|$|E
