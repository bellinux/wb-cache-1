40|$|The {{previously}} published essays selected by editor John R. Wunder for volume two of this six book series {{take up the}} legal, political, and economic issues of Native American sovereignty at the critical moment of the 1903 Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock United States Supreme Court decision (treated in volume one). In his brief introduction to volume two, Wunder describes the period from 1903 to 1968 as {{one in which the}} tension between federally enforced tribal constitutionalism and 2 ̆ 2 residual sovereign rights 2 ̆ 2 was played out. Excerpts from Charles Wilkinson 2 ̆ 7 s American Indians, Time, and the Law (1987) provide an opening framework to explain this tension, Wilkinson arguing that 2 ̆ 2 as the modern era began, the construct of Indian law ultimately rested on two separate braces of opinions. 2 ̆ 2 Federal Indian legal doctrine drew upon Supreme Court decisions dating from the early nineteenth century that recognized Native American governments as autonomous 2 ̆ 2 domestic dependent nations, 2 ̆ 2 entities capable of and entitled to managing their own affairs. But competing with doctrine established in Worcester v. Georgia (183 2), Ex parte Crow Dog (1883), and Talton v. Mayes (1896) was a second line of Supreme Court opinions dating to the end and turn of the century, including Lone Wolf, which accepted plenary federal power over tribal life and governance. Wilkinson 2 ̆ 7 s leadoff essay is followed by a variety of well-known journal articles and book chapters that explore the tension in this era between the assertion, or attempted assertion, of sovereign tribal rights and the exercise of nearly unchecked power by the United States government. These essays make clear that the naked use of military force was a thing of the past-the power of the United States in the twentieth century expressing itself instead through judicial, <b>administrative,</b> and legislative <b>fiat.</b> Actions and decision spill out of Washington, D. C., that affect fundamental property rights and economic opportunity such as the control of water; the reorganization of tribal governments and the imposition of constitutional governance; the resolution of land claims; the termination of federal-tribe relations with the elimination of numerous reservations and much of the trust support system previously established by federal courts and Congress; the extension of state control in lieu of the federal-tribe relation; and relocation of reservation residents to urban areas. All of the articles in volume two will enrich a reader 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of critical issues concerning what Wunder calls 2 ̆ 2 constitutionalism. 2 ̆ 2 The volume would have been more useful though had Wunder provided a significantly longer editor 2 ̆ 7 s introduction. The disparate essays need to be woven together. The facts and conclusions of older articles need to be evaluated against subsequent political and legal actions as well as more recent scholarship. Authors whose complementary or competing ideas have not found representation in these pages need to be referenced.

40|$|Introduction The "simultaneous {{ascending}} auction" {{was first}} introduced in 1994 to sell licenses to use bands of radio spectrum in the United States. Much of the attention devoted to the auction came from its role in reducing federal regulation of the radio spectrum and allowing market values, rather than <b>administrative</b> <b>fiat,</b> to determine who would use the spectrum resource. Many observers were also fascinated by the extensive reliance of the auction on web-like information technology. The {{large amounts of money}} involved were yet another source of interest. The very first use of the auction rules was a US$ 617 million sale of ten paging licenses in July 1994. In the broadband PCS auction, which began in December 1994, ninety-nine licenses were sold for a total price of approximately US$ 7 billion. Once the auctions had been conducted, it became much harder to ignore the tremendous value of the large amounts of spectrum allocated to uses such as high definition te...|$|E

The separation between ownership and control, which represents the hallmark of the public corporation, is untenable in higher education, unless academics are denied the right to selfownership.

40|$|Most {{regional}} policy-makers have, as one {{of their}} important policy goals, some form of maximization of regional economic activity. Obtaining maximum output, employment, and income from a state 2 ̆ 7 s, or region 2 ̆ 7 s, resource base appears to be central to many planning and policy agencies. For example, the State of Utah considered limiting the sources of coal for new electrical generation plants in the state, to in-state coal fields through legislative or <b>administrative</b> <b>fiat.</b> While such a policy was not implemented, it represents the conviction that verticle integration within a region will increase that region 2 ̆ 7 s economic welfare.

40|$|When China {{became a}} {{republic}} in 1912, the country's core territorial units of province and county were retained intact. Continuity in the territorial architecture of state from empire to republic invites {{the question of}} whether provinces and counties were institutionally identical before and after the revolution. This paper explores adjustments made to the county level of government aimed at meeting republican ideals of good government and popular sovereignty. It probes changes in the roles assigned to county heads and the patterns of their appointment in Guangdong relating to educational qualifications, native places, and tenure over the transitional period. Employing magistrate tenure as a proxy for the stability of local government, the paper correlates variations in the length of tenure with other variables at the provincial and sub-provincial levels of government, including competition between different echelon levels, disputes between military and civil authorities, in-fighting among regime factions, and methods of appointment varying over time from appointment by <b>administrative</b> <b>fiat</b> to county-head elections. By relating these variables to longitudinal data on magistrates' length of tenure, it identifies some of the challenges facing provincial and county authorities in trying to manage the revolutionary transition from empire to republic at the local level while keeping the inherited territorial system largely intact...|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{the impact}} of {{colonialism}} on ethnic group formation are legion. Wolpe (1974), for example, shows that the Igbo of Nigeria were a product of colonial-era boundary drawing.

40|$|Policy-making on {{the third}} sector as a subject of policy in the Member States of the European Union is {{primarily}} a matter for domestic (national and sub-national) public authorities, working {{in collaboration with the}} third sector itself and other policy actors. However, over the past 25 years, the European Union (EU) collectively has increasingly taken an interest in this sphere. Most of this activity has been low visibility and 'soft' in character, with implemented initiatives not involving direct, mandatory or 'hard' intervention in domestic policy communities by the EU. But it has involved significant commitments of EU financial resources and periods of sustained multi-level collective policy effort. It therefore merits attention from scholarly and policy viewpoints. Drawing on the findings of a major multi-country study of horizontal third sector policy (i. e. cross-cutting policy pertaining to the sector as a whole), this article interprets this phenomenon through the lens of the 'Europeanization' literature. This literature is sensitive to the possibility that policy linkages between the EU and other pan-European institutions and country-level policy communities can be significant and consequential even if they do not involve primary law-making or <b>administrative</b> <b>fiat</b> {{on the part of the}} originating bodies. The article reviews the extent to which Europeanization, understood in three related but distinctive ways, has proceeded over the past quarter of a century and discusses the causes and consequences of this process. The article shows that overall, relatively modest and very uneven progress towards third sector Europeanization can be said to have proceeded on this account. It reviews why this has tended to be the case and also discusses the conditions under which third sector European policy has managed to proceed relatively effectively and productively.

Much {{of the attention}} devoted to the auction came from its role in reducing federal regulation of the radio spectrum and allowing market values, rather than <b>administrative</b> <b>fiat,</b> to determine who would use the spectrum resource. Several parts of economic theory proved helpful in designing the rules for simultaneous ascending auction and in thinking about how the design might be improved and adapted for new applications. After briefly reviewing the major rules of the auction in section 2, the author turns in section 3 to an analysis based on tatonnement theory, which regards the auction as a mechanism for discovering an efficient allocation and its supporting prices. The analysis reveals a fundamental difference between situations in which the licenses are mutual substitutes and others in which the same licenses are sometimes substitutes and sometimes complements. Section 4 is a selective account of some applications of game theory to evaluating the simultaneous ascending auction design for spectrum sales. Results like those reported in section 3 have led to renewed interest in auctions in which bids for license packages are permitted. In section 5, the author uses game theory to analyze the biases in a leading proposal for dynamic combinatorial bidding. Section 6 briefly answers two additional questions that economists often ask about auction design: If trading of licenses after the auction is allowed, why does the auction form matter at all for promoting efficient license assignments? Holding fixed the quantity of licenses to be sold, how sharp is {{the conflict between the}} objectives of assigning licenses efficiently and obtaining maximum revenue? Section 7 concludes.

40|$|Cherokee {{sociologist}} Eva Garroutte has {{fashioned a}} genuine {{contribution to the}} study of the American Indian in the United States. Herself a mixed-race person of Caucasian and Indian heritage, she focuses on the always troublesome and often controversial issue of Indian identity, one that pervades the consciousness of all Native Americans, and not a few non-Native folks. Her straightforward narrative is informed by published and unpublished sources in law, history, social science, and literature and enhanced by numerous in-depth interviews with Indian and non-Indian people. What results constitutes the single comprehensive book-length examination of 2 ̆ 2 Indian-ness 2 ̆ 2 in print. Great Plains tribal and individual examples are included throughout the volume to help illustrate the historical and contemporary problem of deciding exactly who is and, as importantly, who is not identifiable as Indian. Garroutte offers a fascinating congeries of attempts to resolve this elusive issue. The federal government through <b>administrative</b> <b>fiat,</b> court decisions, and legislation has struggled valiantly to provide an immutable standard, but has only succeeded in dispensing confusing· and contradictory dictums. Each tribe across the nation has weighed in with a particularistic definition of Indian identity, inextricably tied to tribal membership, but this has done little beyond reflecting Native peoples 2 ̆ 7 dissatisfaction with endless measuring and assessments of blood quantums and cultural attributes. Refreshingly, Garroutte steps outside and around most scholars and others who have participated in the continuing discourse on Indian-ness by adopting a new paradigm-radical indigenism. As she deftly explains, radical indigenism presumes the efficacy of uniquely Indian approaches and models in pursuing questions of identity. She argues that established academic disciplines will likely fall a bit short in the search for satisfactory explanations unless they recognize the worth of alternative modes of research and analysis. Her commonsensical assertion seems to me eminently reasonable, and 2 ̆ 2 radical 2 ̆ 2 only in not being previously accepted...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{draws on}} the {{analysis}} of media texts and ethnographic fieldwork to present case studies of the production, distribution, and consumption of two kinds of media products in China that are used for educating cadres about official policies, law and morality, namely, a Party-produced prefectural newspaper and an anticorruption film. Such pedagogic media products merit study because they are consumed by a huge audience of cadres who are entrusted with interpreting and implementing state policy and with carrying out the daily work of the different institutions {{that make up the}} Party-state. The case studies show that the internal circulation of pedagogic media products within the Party-state apparatus works in two ways to reinforce "organizational involution", which causes poor governance. First, the content of the media products and their methods of distribution buttress the norms and institutional practices that entrench unchallenged power, corruption, and official malfeasance within the system. Examples include the role of top-down <b>administrative</b> <b>fiat</b> in determining the content of the media products {{and the ways in which}} individuals and institutions are compelled to purchase materials and participate in pedagogic activities to secure their positions. Second, state pedagogy deflects attention away from the structural failings of the Party-state system. The pedagogic products enable the Party-state to portray itself as the leading crusader in the fight against corruption, despite the corrupting consequences of its continuing unsupervised monopoly on power. Meanwhile, self-improvement exhortations in the media texts sidestep the question of systemic political reform.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{incumbent}} Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has been besieged by accusations of corruption, bribery, and influence-peddling in the approval and allocation of foreign-financed public contracts. The latest scandal directly implicating the President involved a proposed National Broadband Network (NBN) to be undertaken by a Chinese contractor, ZTE Corporation, under a foreign loan financing {{agreement with the}} Chinese government. During Senate investigations of the NBN contracts, then-Secretary of the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) Romulo L. Neri disclosed that he was offered a 200 million Philippine peso (Php) bribe to favorably endorse the contract. A subsequent NEDA whistleblower was later abducted by government authorities, apparently {{to prevent him from}} testifying on multimillion dollar kickbacks demanded for the NBN project, and how NEDA had been reduced to a rubber-stamp in the evaluation and approval process. On the heels of public riots, impeachment threats, and the near-toppling of the Arroyo government, the President declared the cancellation of the NBN contract in October 2007. This paper examines the Presidential use of "administrative authority" within the process of approving, policing, and monitoring of foreign-financed contracts, specifically in the form of projects financed through Official Development Assistance (ODA) or through "tied loans" that require selection of the project contractor from the donor country. Analysis of Philippine administrative law and jurisprudence reveals that the President's broadly-construed authority to conduct administrative reorganizations grants her virtually full control of the ODA approval, evaluation, and monitoring process and seriously undermines the functional independence of NEDA (and its Investment Coordination Committee). This is contrary to the legislative intent of ensuring inter-agency checks and proper project vetting under the Official Development Assistance Act of 1996. To date, however, the Philippine Supreme Court has set a relatively low threshold of "good faith and administrative efficiency" for affirmation of the validity of administrative reorganizations. The Court has exhibited an almost-automatic deference to the President's assertion of "good faith and administrative efficiency purposes. " In light of important constitutional policies that regulate foreign loan contracting, this paper proposes that the Court reconsider its minimal test for the validity of administrative reorganizations, particularly when they occur against the sensitive context of ODA project approvals and allocations. When the President's <b>administrative</b> <b>fiat</b> is apparently deployed to circumvent legislative standards and constitutionally-mandated independent agency oversight, the Court should exercise its expanded power of judicial review under the 1987 Philippine Constitution to impose higher scrutiny on the President's exercise of power to reorganize the Executive Branch...|$|E
40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsVincent Amanor-BoaduThe {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{estimate}} the value accruing to Zambian bean supply chain participants with the view to showing that value at the different stages {{is a function of}} the value addition and risk incurred at those stages. The data used in the study came from two different surveys done under the Pulse Value Chain Initiative – Zambia focusing on producers and bean traders. The surveys used structured questionnaires for both producers and traders. The producers were sampled from three principal bean producing provinces in Zambia: Lundazi, Mbala and Kalomo. The traders were sampled from the largest consumer region in the country – Lusaka – and focused on traders operating in the three principal markets in the city: Soweto; Chilenje; and Mtendere. The analyses were conducted using STATA®, employing both statistical and econometric methods. 	Value was defined as a function of transaction costs and value addition as well as the risks borne. In the Zambian mixed bean trade environment, where traders travel to remote locations where producers live and produce, they are seen to incur higher levels of risk and undertake higher levels of value addition – assembling the grain, bagging them and moving them from the rural areas where production occurs to the cities where customers reside. As such, it is expected that value creation and distribution would increase away from the farm. The results confirmed this expectation. The total average value created at the farm level was ZMK 3, 391. 06 /kg. However, the average value accruing to traders who only undertook wholesaling was ZMK 7, 405. 75 /kg while that accruing to traders going further down the chain to retail was ZMK 9, 663. 56 /kg. Traders who engaged in institutional trade produced an average value of ZMK 8, 750. 75 /kg. 	The share of total value produced accruing to producers in the producer-wholesaler-retailer chain was about 16. 6 percent because of the higher value addition and risk that occur further downstream in the chain. The share of total value produced accruing to producers in the producer-wholesaler-institutional buyer chain was about 17. 3 percent. The study showed that female producers’ share was not different, statistically speaking, from male producers’ value. It also showed that the average value created in thin (smaller) markets was higher than the value created in larger markets, probably because of the level of competition that occurs in the latter markets. Interestingly, the results showed that the larger the land holdings of producers, the lower the value created. This is in line with the foregoing results of size, competition and value. The study suggests that producers’ share of total value created may be enhanced by helping producers undertake specific activities that increased the value they added and reduce the risks that traders bear in their search for grain. One of such activities could be the formation of horizontal strategic alliances among producers that allowed producers to aggregate grain at particular locations in significant lots and bag them. This service would allow them to extract higher value from the exchange with traders. Any attempt to address the perceived “unfair” distribution of value along the supply chain by <b>administrative</b> <b>fiat</b> could result in higher costs to the whole supply chain and crate adverse unintended consequences for producers and the treasury...|$|E
40|$|Over time, water prices {{need to move}} {{to their}} own level, argues John Quiggin DESPITE the recent rains, the problem of water {{shortages}} in Australia {{is not going to}} go away. The problem is not one of inadequate total supply (on a per-person basis, Australia has plenty of water), but one of competing demands for water in specific locations. Politically determined boundaries can make a big difference, and a dispute over these boundaries has opened up within the commonwealth government. One of the biggest issues in water policy is whether water allocated to irrigation should be transferred to cities, either through <b>administrative</b> <b>fiat</b> or through unrestricted trade in water markets. Treasury secretary Ken Henry has called for water prices to be equalised between urban and rural users, something that would happen naturally with unrestricted trade. Treasurer Peter Costello has been less explicit, but has spoken in glowing terms of the merits of national markets in water and energy. By contrast, the prime minister has set his face firmly against the idea. His parliamentary secretary, Gary Nairn, has said ‘cities must learn to use the water they had more efficiently before they considered buying irrigation water from outside their catchments’ and even appears to support stringent restrictions on trade between rural catchments. A useful way to think about this issue is to mentally substitute ‘land’ for ‘water’. Cities have always grown by converting farmland to residential use. Concern about the resulting loss of productive capacity was a hot topic in the United States a decade or so ago, but the issue has not gained much traction in Australia. There are good urban planning reasons for keeping green space, including farms, but few would support a general ban on the conversion of agricultural land to residential use, or requiring cities to accommodate all future population growth within their existing boundaries. Similar points apply to water. There are reasons to be careful before moving to unrestricted trade in water rights. Moves poorly thought out in this direction have produced unforeseen consequences such as the activation of unused, but now valuable water rights (called ‘sleepers’) thereby exacerbating the problem that trade was meant to resolve. Nevertheless, in the long run, water should be allocated to its most valuable process, and the standard way of doing this is through market transactions. The cost of getting things wrong could be substantial. If the price of water differs greatly in different locations, expensive options for water conservation may be pursued where water is scarce, when cheaper opportunities are available elsewhere in the system. And if transfers of water are regulated improperly, expensive options may be adopted simply because they avoid controls that preclude cheaper alternatives. Suggestions to require all new houses to have rainwater tanks are superficially appealing, but would cost billions of dollars over, say, ten or twenty years, and would yield only modest savings in water use in many locations, such as those with long dry seasons. It would probably be cheaper to look at reusing stormwater on parks and gardens. The recently announced project to pipe water to the Wimmera also raises some concerns. The announced cost is $ 500 million for an annual saving of 100 gigalitres now lost through evaporation and seepage, implying a capital cost of $ 5000 for each megalitre saved annually. The market price of permanent water transfers in most parts of the Murray-Darling Basin is well below this, suggesting that cheaper conservation options may exist elsewhere. Of course, the fact that water is heavy and hard to transfer means that these prices are not necessarily relevant to the Wimmera, but the issue ought to be looked at. In general, transferring some water from irrigation use to cities in or near the Murray-Darling Basin, including Adelaide, Melbourne and Canberra, looks like a sensible option in the long term, but careful evaluation is necessary to ensure that this is done in a way that is both environmentally and economically sustainable. Proposals to transfer water from Tantangara Dam in the Snowy Mountains to the Googong Dam supplying Canberra, via the Murrumbidgee, look interesting and potentially feasible. On the other hand, the recent suggestion that this water could be taken further, to the Wollondilly River at Goulburn and thence to Warragamba Dam for use in Sydney, seems like a pipeline too far. This is an issue that needs to be handled carefully. In the long run, however, water must be used where its social value is greatest. Implementation of this principle will almost certainly involve market-based transfers between environmental, irrigation and residential users. • Professor John Quiggin is a federation fellow in economics and political science based at the University of Queensland and the Australian National University.

40|$|Economists {{have for}} a long time taken a keen {{interest}} in governments assignment of licenses to use the radio frequency spectrum. Traditionally, governments have managed the radio spectrum in a way that has been compared to the regime of GOSPLAN, the famous central planning office of the former Soviet Union (Hazlett, 2003). Economists since Ronald Coase (1959) have argued that allocating a scarce resource by <b>administrative</b> <b>fiat</b> makes little sense. Establishing a market for spectrum, in which owners could buy, sell, subdivide and aggregate units of spectrum would lead to a much more efficient allocation of it. The use of auctions for assigning usage rights to spectrum have been heralded as one of the major achievements of the economical science, and the challenge of developing auction formats for spectrum auctions has been among the major driving forces behind the surge in research related to auctions in the last two decades. In parallel with the introduction of auctions, telecommunication markets have been liberalised. This process of liberalisation has exerted an increasing amount of pressure upon spectrum managers to modernize their practices and to implement a more market based approach to radio spectrum management. The challenge is to assign spectrum in a way that maximizes the value of its use, a problem which ranges far wider than merely picking the auction format among those described in economic theory that is most likely to yield a favourable result. Designing an auction procedure entails making decisions about what to sell, to whom, when, and how; these decisions are, as explained by Milgrom (2004), not independent ones. Among the problems facing the spectrum manager are identifying the appropriate regime of property rights, dividing the spectrum into suitable units for sale, and specifying any additional restrictions on its use and on the set of eligible buyers. The processes of defining the property rights and of dividing it into units are particularly closely interrelated with the choice of auction design. For example, by deciding whether the spectrum should be sold as a single large unit or as a number of smaller units, the spectrum manager determines the range of possible auction formats. The design of the usage right can create complementarities between the lots in the auction, affecting how different formats could be expected to perform. Economical efficiency is often stated as the main objective of spectrum management, although other objectives are frequently formulated by the government as well. The range of policies open to the spectrum manager may be constrained both by national and international law. The spectrum manager is responsible for a resource which is used in several sectors of the economy, and it can be challenging to evaluate how spectrum management policies are best implemented to interact with the other instruments used by the government in pursuance of its objectives in those sectors. The question of whether spectrum management should be used as a tool to affect the market structure in markets where spectrum is being used as an input is a question which illustrates the requirement for coordination between various national government agencies. The emergence of secondary markets for spectrum affects both {{how important it is to}} achieve an optimal initial allocation (Milgrom, 2004) and how different auction formats will work (Krishna, 2002). In this thesis the main objective is to describe an assignment procedure carried out by the Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority (NPT) in 2004 and to evaluate its outcome. My emphasis will be on the process of deciding what to sell, and how. In doing so, I hope to be able to explain more in depth the challenges facing the spectrum manager and to relate these challenges to the development of a novel variant of a successful auction format, the Simultaneous Multiple-Round Auction (SMRA). The new variant, which has been described as SMRA with augmented switching, (Cramton, 2006; OFCOM, 2006 b) was proposed by Professor Nils-Henrik M von der Fehr, and was developed and implemented in collaboration between the NPT, Professor von der Fehr and DotEcon Ltd, a UK based consultancy. It has generally been considered as a success and the variant is due to be implemented again in forthcoming Norwegian and Swedish spectrum auctions. The auction concluded December 1 st 2004 after 87 rounds and 8 days of bidding. As will be described more thoroughly below, the auction appeared to work well, as indicated by the relatively high prices that were generated and by the fact that bidders were able to aggregate seemingly efficient combination of lots. Unlike many other areas where economic theory is applied to real life situations, it is unlikely that all potential readers of this thesis will be able to rely on their previous knowledge about the resource that is being discussed. Most people have quite extensive knowledge about the nature of (and property rights to) other resources such as land, labour and tangible factor inputs. While some have a little knowledge about the electromagnetic spectrum, few know much about the nature of usage rights to spectrum, how it is actually managed or regulated and how its value is determined to a large degree by standardisation bodies, industry forums, and governmental and non- governmental international institutions. In order to facilitate readers with varying degree of prior knowledge, I have placed some of the more detailed descriptions of e. g. the nature of the spectrum, its uses and how it is regulated into appendixes. I have tried to organize the main sections in accordance with the logical sequence of the spectrum manager s problem solving process, which leads up to a particular assignment procedure and choice of auction format. The main deviation from this approach is that I have inserted a section containing a description of the Simultaneous Multiple Round Auction (SMRA) before I describe the process of dividing spectrum into lots for an auction. The reason for this is that the properties of auctions in general and this format in particular, are often taken into account when decisions are made on the size and bundling of lots for the auction. Those who know nothing about the radio spectrum and how it is managed could begin by reading some of the appendixes. The analogy between usage rights to spectrum and usage rights to land will be frequently used. Even though land is normally thought of as being owned in distinct and disjoint plots (at least they are disjoint as long as you restrict your attention to the part of the two-dimensional sphere they occupy) and spectrum usage rights normally are designed in such a way that they overlap in the physical dimension in which they are most frequently described, the analogy is still useful for many purposes. The validity of the analogy does (of course) not rely on the two concepts being exactly equal. I believe that lawyers concept of property as a bundle of rights is a useful complement to the general concept of exclusivity and the economists concept of externalities. The three will enable one to think somewhat intuitively about the properties of usage rights to spectrum. More appendixes could have been included. In his 1959 article The Federal Communications Commission, Ronald Coase presented the argument for an efficient market based on property rights in radio spectrum. This article was an important predecessor for the 1960 article The Problem of Social Cost in which he states that: This article, although concerned with a technical problem of economic analysis, arose out of the study of the Political Economy of Broadcasting which I am now conducting. The argument of the present article was implicit in a previous article dealing with the problem of allocating radio and television frequencies ("The Federal Communications Commission," J. Law and Econ., II (1959)) but comments which I have received seemed to suggest that it would be desirable to deal with the question in a more explicit way and without reference to the original problem for the solution of which the analysis was developed. The 1960 article has certainly been very valuable to me, in that it has enabled me to organize my thoughts about spectrum management. If it were permitted, I would have appended Ronald Coase s The Problem of Social Cost in its entirety...|$|E
