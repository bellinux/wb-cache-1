The group also {{included}} test playing nations Sri Lanka, England and Bangladesh, along with Scotland.|$|E
25|$|India's growing {{influence}} in <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>has</b> upset Pakistan and other pro-Taliban elements. The Times {{said in an}} editorial that with the United States and other NATO members unwilling to sustain long-term commitments to Afghanistan, the Taliban see India as the only regional enemy capable of resisting them.|$|E

25|$|The Persian poet Rumi, who {{was born}} in present-day <b>Afghanistan,</b> <b>has</b> {{become one of the most}} widely read poets in the United States, thanks largely to the interpretative {{translations}} published by Coleman Barks. Elif Şafak's novel The Forty Rules of Love is a fictionalized account of Rumi's encounter with the Persian dervish Shams Tabrizi.|$|E
25|$|The long {{border between}} Afghanistan and West Pakistan was uneasy. This {{is due in}} part to the {{independent}} Pashtun tribes that inhabit the area. In addition, the physical boundary is uncertain: the 1893 Durand Line was used by West Pakistan to mark the border between the two countries, but <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>has</b> never recognised that frontier.|$|E
25|$|Various {{advocacy}} groups, {{such as the}} Hazara People International Network, {{have been}} formed to publicise the situation and promote opposition to it. The Hazara diaspora in Australia, Western Europe and North America have also joined these protests from time to time. Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq, the political leader of the Hazara in <b>Afghanistan,</b> <b>has</b> also expressed solidarity with the Hazara community in Quetta.|$|E

25|$|France’s {{experience}} in <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>has</b> mirrored every other country’s misadventures in this Central Asian state; some small successes followed by some pretty devastating defeats. Initially, the French involvement in Afghanistan {{was limited to}} the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in Kabul; as that mission expanded to encompass the entire country, France slowly amped up its involvement. By 2008, France had sole responsibility for Kapisa, and a district of Kabul Province that borders it. The French mission in <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>has</b> been fraught with struggle. The French military has fought very hard in Afghanistan and lost a lot of soldiers in the process: 87 since 2008 (many argue that there were more fatalities), behind only the U.S., Canada, and the UK. Yet, the newly elected French President François Hollande announced that French troops would withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of 2012– sparking speculation about whether this indicated the NATO coalition there is starting to crumble.|$|E
25|$|<b>Afghanistan</b> <b>has</b> around 150 radio {{stations}} and over 50 television stations, which includes the state-owned RTA TV and various private channels such as Tolo TV and Shamshad TV. The first Afghan newspaper was published in 1906. By the 1920s, Radio Kabul was broadcasting local radio services. Television programs began airing in the early 1970s. Voice of America, BBC, and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) broadcast in both of Afghanistan's official languages.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to {{an expansion of the}} inter-provincial tournament from 25-over matches to 50-over matches and the addition of the T-20 and multi-day formats, cricket in <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>has</b> now expanded across the provinces as well; 32 of the 34 provinces now have representative sides. All provinces except Daykundi and Farah have a representative team, while the ACB recognizes Afghan Refugees and Koochian (Nomads) as provincial teams. The three-day league competition was expanded into a four-day league in 2014-15.|$|E

25|$|Some {{settlements}} in the Indus Valley Civilization were also fortified. By about 3500BC, hundreds of small farming villages dotted the Indus floodplain. Many of these settlements had fortifications and planned streets. The stone and mud brick houses of Kot Diji were clustered behind massive stone flood dykes and defensive walls, for neighboring communities quarreled constantly about the control of prime agricultural land. Mundigak (c. 2500BC) in present-day south-east <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>has</b> defensive walls and square bastions of sun dried bricks.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} and consumption of alcoholic beverages, especially wine, in <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>has</b> a long tradition – going {{back at least to}} the fourth century BC. Currently, the possession and consumption of alcohol is prohibited for Afghan nationals. However, the Afghan government provides a license for various many outlets to distribute alcoholic beverages to foreign journalists and tourists, and black market alcohol consumption is prevalent as well. Bringing two bottles or two litres of alcoholic beverages is allowed for foreigners entering Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{exploration}} {{done in the}} 20th century {{suggests that}} the geographical area of <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>has</b> been closely connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east, west, and north. Artifacts typical of the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron ages {{have been found in}} Afghanistan. Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of Mundigak (near Kandahar in the south of the country) may have been a colony of the nearby Indus Valley Civilization.|$|E

50|$|During the tournament, <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>had</b> {{the most}} diverse squad. While most other nations had almost all players playing for their {{domestic}} league, <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>had</b> five players playing outside of Asia with four in Europe and the rest in either India's I-League or its domestic league the Afghan Premier League.

25|$|<b>Afghanistan</b> <b>has</b> been {{a member}} of the United Nations since 1946. It enjoys cordial {{relations}} with a number of NATO and allied nations, particularly the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and Turkey. In 2012, the United States and Afghanistan signed their Strategic Partnership Agreement in which Afghanistan became a major non-NATO ally. Afghanistan also has friendly diplomatic relations with neighboring China, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, including with regional states such as Bangladesh, India, Japan, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Russia, South Korea, the UAE, and so forth. The Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs continues to develop diplomatic relations with other countries around the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{inclusion}} of Myanmar in South Asia is without consensus, with many considering it {{a part of}} Southeast Asia and others including it within South Asia. Afghanistan was of importance to the British colonial empire, especially after the Second Anglo-Afghan War over 1878–1880. Afghanistan remained a British protectorate until 1919, when a treaty with Vladimir Lenin included the granting of independence to Afghanistan. Following India's partition, <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>has</b> generally been included in South Asia, with some considering it a part of Southwest Asia. During the Soviet war in Afghanistan (1979–1989) American foreign policy considered Pakistan and Afghanistan in Southwest Asia, while others included it {{as a part of}} South Asia. There is no universal agreement among scholars on which countries should be included within South Asia.|$|E
25|$|In Iran, the world's leading producer, the {{erstwhile}} and northeasterly Khorasan Province, {{which in}} 2004 was divided in three, grows 95 percent of Iranian saffron: the hinterlands of Birjand, Ghayen, Ferdows in South Khorasan Province, along with areas abutting Gonabad and Torbat-e Heydarieh in Razavi Khorasan Province, are its key cropping areas. <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>has</b> resumed cultivation in recent years; in restive Kashmir it has waned. Despite numerous cultivation efforts in such countries as Austria, England, Germany, and Switzerland, only select locales continue the harvest in northern and central Europe. Among {{these is the}} small Swiss village of Mund, in the Valais canton, whose annual saffron output amounts to several kilograms. Microscale cultivation occurs in Tasmania, China, Egypt, France, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Turkey (especially Safranbolu), California, and Central Africa.|$|E
