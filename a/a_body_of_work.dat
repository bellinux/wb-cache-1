The late Renaissance in Spain produced artists such as El Greco and composers such as Tomás Luis de Victoria and Antonio de Cabezón.|$|E
5|$|Kwee Tek Hoay's {{first stage}} play, Allah jang Palsoe was written as a realist {{response}} to whimsical contemporary theatres. Though the published stageplay sold poorly {{and the play}} was deemed difficult to perform, Allah jang Palsoe found success on the stage. By 1930 it had been performed by various ethnic Chinese troupes to popular acclaim and pioneered <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> by authors such as Lauw Giok Lan, Tio Ie Soei, and Tjoa Tjien Mo. In 2006 the script for the play, which continues to be performed, was republished with updated spelling by the Lontar Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Post {{is where}} {{mainstream}} music could have gone. While modern chart music hasn't gone there entirely, Björk {{opened up the}} space for a more enigmatic and less readily labelled style; she undoubtedly helped broaden the playing field. Modern music still, regularly, finds itself, like a dinosaur stuck in a tar pit, going nowhere and heading for extinction. Yet, there are pockets of air that artists like Björk - and those before her like Kate Bush - have pumped full of oxygen for the next generations of rare, raw and intense female talents - the Lordes and Sias of the world - to breath. In this way, the album title is a misnomer. Björk was a precursor rather than a late comer, less post than pre. Post stands today as <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> that still informs the more marginal artistic fringes of modern music and reminds us how narrow and staid our world would be without outliers like Björk.|$|E

25|$|Isabella di Morra (ca. 15201545/1546) was an Italian poet of the Renaissance.

25|$|America in Vietnam (1978), by Guenter Lewy, is {{an example}} of {{historical}} revisionism that differs much from the popular view {{of the role of the}} U.S. in the Vietnam War (1955–75), for which the author was criticised and supported for belonging to the revisionist school on the history of the Vietnam War. Lewy's reinterpretation was the first book of <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> by historians of the revisionist school about the geopolitical role and the military behavior of the United States in the country of Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|The Vaishnava Bhakti (devotional) {{movement}} involving well-known Haridasas (devotee saints) of {{that time}} made an indelible imprint on Kannada literature starting in the 15th century, inspiring <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> called Haridasa Sahitya ("Haridasa literature"). Influenced by the Veerashaivism of the 12th century, this movement touched {{the lives of millions}} with its strong current of devotion. The Haridasas conveyed the message of Vedantic philosopher Madhvacharya to the common man through simple Kannada language in the form of devaranamas and kirthanas (devotional songs in praise of god). The philosophy of Madhvacharya was spread by eminent disciples including Naraharitirtha, Jayatirtha, Vyasatirtha, Sripadaraya, Vadirajatirtha, Purandara Dasa, and Kanaka Dasa. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, a prominent saint from distant Bengal, visited the region in 1510, further stimulating the devotional movement.|$|E
25|$|Though Hafez is {{well known}} for his poetry, he is less {{commonly}} recognized for his intellectual and political contributions. A defining feature of Hafez' poetry is its ironic tone and the theme of hypocrisy, widely believed to be a critique of the religious and ruling establishments of the time. Persian satire developed during the 14th century, within the courts of the Mongol Period. In this period, Hafez and other notable early satirists, such as Ubayd Zakani, produced <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> that has since become a template for the use of satire as a political device. Many of his critiques are believed to be targeted at the rule of Amir Mobarez Al-Din Mohammad, specifically, towards the disintegration of important public and private institutions. He was a Sufi Muslim.|$|E

25|$|Baruch Spinoza founded Spinozism, {{broke with}} Rabbinic Jewish tradition, and {{was placed in}} herem by the Beit Din of Amsterdam. The {{influence}} in his work from Maimonides and Leone Ebreo is evident. Elia del Medigo {{claims to be a}} student of the works of Spinoza. Some contemporary critics (e.g., Wachter, Der Spinozismus im Judenthum) claimed to detect the influence of the Kabbalah, while others (e.g., Leibniz) regarded Spinozism as a revival of Averroism – a talmudist manner of referencing to Maimonidean Rationalism. In the centuries that have lapsed since the herem declaration, scholars have re-examined the works of Spinoza and find them to reflect <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and thinking that is not unlike some contemporary streams of Judaism. For instance, while Spinoza was accused of pantheism, scholars have come to view his work as advocating panentheism, a valid contemporary view easily accommodated by contemporary Judaism.|$|E
25|$|Lavoisier {{subsequently}} {{discovered and}} named oxygen, described {{its role in}} animal respiration and the calcination of metals exposed to air (1774–1778). In 1783, Lavoisier found that water was a compound of oxygen and hydrogen. Lavoisier’s years of experimentation formed <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> that contested phlogiston theory. After reading his “Reflections on Phlogiston” to the Academy in 1785, chemists began dividing into camps based on the old phlogiston theory and the new oxygen theory. A new form of chemical nomenclature, developed by Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau, with assistance from Lavoisier, classified elements binomially into a genus and a species. For example, burned lead was of the genus oxide and species lead. Transition to and acceptance of Lavoisier’s new chemistry varied in pace across Europe. The new chemistry was established in Glasgow and Edinburgh early in the 1790s, but was slow to become established in Germany. Eventually the oxygen-based theory of combustion drowned out the phlogiston theory {{and in the process}} created the basis of modern chemistry.|$|E
25|$|Beginning with Life on Earth in 1979, Attenborough {{set about}} {{creating}} <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> {{which became a}} benchmark of quality in wildlife film-making and influenced a generation of documentary film-makers. The series also established many {{of the hallmarks of}} the BBC's natural history output. By treating his subject seriously and researching the latest discoveries, Attenborough and his production team gained the trust of scientists, who responded by allowing him to feature their subjects in his programmes. In Rwanda, for example, Attenborough and his crew were granted privileged access to film Dian Fossey's research group of mountain gorillas. Innovation was another factor in Life on Earths success: new film-making techniques were devised to get the shots Attenborough wanted, with a focus on events and animals that were hitherto unfilmed. Computerised airline schedules, which had only recently been introduced, enabled the series to be elaborately devised so that Attenborough visited several locations around the globe in each episode, sometimes even changing continents mid-sentence. Although appearing as the on-screen presenter, he consciously restricted his time on camera to give his subjects top billing.|$|E
