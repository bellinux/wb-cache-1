At another place we had seen before, we dug and found some more corn, two or three baskets full, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> beans....In all we had about ten bushels, which will be enough for seed. It is with God's help that we found this corn, for how else could we have done it, without meeting some Indians who might trouble us.|$|E
5|$|The {{two ships}} opened fire just before 18:00 {{at a range}} of about , with Shannon scoring the first hit, {{striking}} Chesapeake {{on one of her}} forward gunports with two round shot <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> musket balls fired by William Mindham, the gun captain of the aftmost of Shannons starboard 18-pounders. Chesapeake was moving faster than Shannon, and as she ranged {{down the side of the}} British ship, the destruction inflicted by the precise and methodical gunnery of the British crew moved aft with the American's forward gun crews suffering the heaviest losses. However, the American crew were well drilled and, despite their losses, returned fire briskly. As Chesapeake was heeling, many of their shots struck the water or waterline of Shannon causing little damage, but American carronade fire caused serious damage to Shannons rigging. In particular, a 32-pound carronade ball struck the piled shot for the Shannons 12-pounder gun that was stowed in the main chains; the shot was propelled through the timbers to scatter like hail across the gundeck.|$|E

25|$|Turning {{away from}} fantasy as a genre, Garner {{produced}} The Stone Book Quartet (1979), {{a series of}} four short novellas detailing {{a day in the}} life of four generations of his family.

In his subsequent novels, Strandloper (1996) and Thursbitch (2003), he continued writing tales revolving around Cheshire, although without the fantasy elements which had characterised his earlier work. In 2012, he finally published a third book in the Weirdstone trilogy, Boneland.|$|E

25|$|Eihei-ji has sought, since medieval times, {{a source}} of income by soliciting monks to {{purchase}} honorary titles. Monks may progress through four hōkai (dharma ranks) with some time requirements of months or years between ranks. The final step in becoming a priest is zuise which means becoming ichiya-no-jūshoku (abbot for one night) at both head temples (Eihei-ji and Sōji-ji). Zuise entails paying each temple 50,000 yen (about 605 as of April 2012) for the ceremony (and about 50 to the official photographer). A monk receives an honorary meal <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> souvenirs at Eihei-ji and then, within one month, repeats the ceremony at Sōji-ji. The monk is then considered an oshō (priest and teacher).|$|E

Haley Wood denied rumors that an alleged recent separation from Goldstein had contributed to his relapse, saying that the couple had still been together at the time.|$|E

500|$|Despite the criticism, L'Estrange {{performed}} {{at least once}} more at Middle Harbour, although crowds were down to a few hundred, requiring only four steamers to transport them. The same night he was guest of honour at a testimonial dinner held at the Victoria Theatre where The Young Australian Band played [...] "The Blondin March", a piece composed specially by their conductor Mr J. Devlin. He was presented with a large gold star, engraved with a scene of his latest triumph, the date of his public performance. Measuring [...] across, it was centred with a 1½ carat diamond and suspended by a blue ribbon to a clasp featuring the Australian coat of arms in silver. An illuminated address <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> sovereigns, collected from his admirers, were also given.

500|$|A {{number of}} {{alternate}} universes in Marvel Comics publications allow writers to introduce variations on Osborn, {{in which the}} character's origins, behavior, and morality differ from the mainstream setting. Marvel 2099 depicts the Goblin has a radical trickster who wants to prove that Spider-Man (Miguel O'Hara) is in the pay of a megacorp. He has bat-like glider-wings <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> [...] "tricks", similar to the 20th century version. He also {{has the ability to}} project illusions. In Earth X, Osborn's business ventures have completely taken over the United States. Citizens work in his businesses, shop in his stores and eat his food and is partially {{responsible for the deaths of}} the Avengers as he sent them to battle a now Super Intelligent Absorbing Man. In the Marvel Noir universe, Osborn is a former circus freak who was mistreated from the audience for his reptile-like skin disorder. This fueled his ambitions in earning his [...] "respect" [...] by becoming the major Crime Lord in New York. The Ultimate Marvel version of Osborn was an industrialist and scientist who is trying to perfect the Super Soldier drug for S.H.I.E.L.D., an obsession that leads to the neglect of his wife and son.|$|E

Tired of making nooses and thinking {{that the government would}} never hang a woman, he made Surratt's noose the night before the execution with five loops rather than the regulation seven. He tested the nooses that night by tying them to a tree limb <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> buckshot and then tossing the bag to the ground (the ropes held). Civilian workers did not want to dig the graves out of superstitious fear, so Rath asked for volunteers among the soldiers at the Arsenal and received more help than he needed.|$|E

2500|$|In {{painting}} buon fresco, a rough underlayer {{called the}} arriccio {{is added to}} the whole area to be painted and allowed to dry for some days. Many artists sketched their compositions on this underlayer, which would never be seen, in a red pigment called sinopia, a name also used to refer to these under-paintings. [...] Later,new techniques for transferring paper drawings to the wall were developed. [...] The main lines of a drawing made on paper were pricked over with a point, the paper held against the wall, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> soot (spolvero) banged on them on produce black dots along the lines. If the painting was to be done over an existing fresco, the surface would be roughened to provide better adhesion. [...] On the day of painting, the intonaco, a thinner, smooth layer of fine plaster was added to the amount of wall that was expected to be completed that day, sometimes matching the contours of the figures or the landscape, but more often just starting {{from the top of the}} composition. [...] This area is called the giornata ("day's work"), and the different day stages can usually be seen in a large fresco, by a sort of seam that separates one from the next.|$|E
