5|$|Aksum's {{currency}} {{served as}} a vessel of propaganda demonstrating the kingdom's wealth and promoting the national religion (first polytheistic and later Oriental Christianity). It also facilitated the Red Sea trade on which it thrived. The coinage has <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> invaluable in providing a reliable chronology of Aksumite kings {{due to the lack}} of extensive archaeological work in the area.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to capture}} weapons from the Germans <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> highly successful. Raids were {{conducted}} on trains carrying equipment to the front, {{as well as on}} guardhouses and gendarmerie posts. Sometimes weapons were taken from individual German soldiers accosted in the street. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army even managed to capture several German armored vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Hokies {{tailback}} Darren Evans {{ran for a}} school-record of 253yards, and exceeded 100rushing {{yards in}} a game {{for the first time}} in his career. The Hokie defense shut down the Terrapins running game and held them to 12yards on 18carries. Maryland <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> unable or unwilling to blitz against Sean Glennon, the Tech quarterback hobbled by an ankle injury. Glennon threw for 127yards and a touchdown.|$|E

5|$|Lemoine <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> that if {{lines are}} drawn through the Lemoine point {{parallel}} {{to the sides of}} the triangle, then the six points of intersection of the lines and the sides of the triangle are concyclic, or that they lie on a circle. This circle is now known as the first Lemoine circle, or simply the Lemoine circle.|$|E
5|$|McLachlan {{first became}} {{interested}} in cinematography after viewing the 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid; Nicolas Roeg's work on the 1971 film Walkabout further cemented {{his interest in the}} field. McLachlan was also motivated by his father, who was an avid photographer. An early school assignment to create a Super 8 film project, for which he received an A grade, <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> a formative influence.|$|E
5|$|The second ITP {{prototype}} (M-2) {{was built}} in 1942 and fitted with a Mikulin AM-37 engine which <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> unreliable and was replaced with a 1,345kW (1,800hp) Mikulin AM-39 that December. It first flew on 23 November 1943 but the manufacturer's flight tests were not completed until June 1944. Since several other aircraft with about {{the same level of}} performance were already available, it was not placed into production.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} Gaalipata turned Ganesh {{into one of}} the most sought-after actors in Kannada cinema. He was already coming on the back of major {{commercial}} successes Mungaru Male (2006), Cheluvina Chittara (2007), and moderate successes Hudugaata (2007) and Krishna (2007). Yogaraj Bhat had delivered his two consecutive films that emerged as massive commercial successes, the other being Mungaru Male. Ganesh was seen in the film wearing a chain around the neck with a razor blade as the pendant. It became a trend among male fans. The film <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> to as a major break for Diganth who would go on to collaborate with Bhat frequently— Manasaare (2009), Pancharangi (2010) and Parapancha (2015). The nickname 'Doodh Peda' (an Indian sweet), by which Ganesh addresses to him as, in the film, came to be attached with his name in the media along with a tag of 'Chocolate Hero'. The film <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> to be a launchpad in the careers of actresses Neethu and Bhavana Rao.|$|E
5|$|Abortion activist Henry Morgentaler's {{appointment}} to the order on 1 July 2008 not only {{marked the first time}} the Advisory Council had not been unanimous in its decision, but <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> {{to be one of the}} most controversial appointments in the order's history, drawing both praise from abortion rights groups and the ire of Members of Parliament, groups opposing abortion, and religious leaders. The latter organized protests outside of Rideau Hall on 9 July, while compatriots did the same in front of Government House in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, the official residence of that province's lieutenant governor.|$|E
5|$|According to Tino's account, {{on the day}} of the election, Selvo was {{attending}} mass for the funeral of the late Doge at the new monastery church of San Nicolò built under Domenico Contarini on Lido, an island in the Venetian Lagoon. The location was ideal for the funeral of a Doge not only because St Mark's Basilica was under construction at the time, but the new church was also spacious enough to hold a fairly large number of people. The location <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> ideal for the election of a new Doge for the very same reasons.|$|E

5|$|Because Lynott {{had worked}} {{alongside}} Smith at the Rainbow Pub, West Midlands Police wished to re-examine {{the cause of}} her death. In early 2001, investigators asked the Irish authorities for a new post mortem, and on 8 March Lynott's body was exhumed by Gardai from a cemetery in Athlone and taken to Dublin City Morgue for further examination by Ireland's State Pathologist, Dr John Harbison. However, {{the results of this}} autopsy <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Edith Chaykoski {{died from}} her wounds at Windsor Metropolitan Hospital at about 05:30 on 26 June. Police searched the {{neighbourhood}} {{during the morning}} and found the shotgun where Lamb had thrown it. They identified it as Hesketh's {{and concluded that the}} 18-year-old must have taken it and gone on a shooting spree the previous day. Lamb was arrested at 15:30 on 26 June and charged with the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski. Under the terms of Canadian law at that time, he faced a mandatory death penalty if convicted. When Woloch's injuries <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> fatal at 14:45 on 11 July 1966, his murder was added to Lamb's charge.|$|E
5|$|In {{the past}} Mérens horses {{were used for}} farm work, {{particularly}} on steep or difficult terrain, as packhorses and for draft work in mining or hauling timber or sledges. Today, following breeding selection towards a slightly taller and livelier type, they are used principally as saddle horses, especially for trekking in mountainous areas; but have <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> successful in carriage driving. Some {{have been used for}} vaulting, dressage, show jumping and three-day eventing.|$|E

5|$|On August 9 {{against the}} Kansas City Royals, Molina {{came in with}} two outs and the bases loaded. After drawing a 1–0 count against Peter Moylan, a brief delay {{occurred}} when a stray kitten had made its way onto the outfield. On the very next pitch to Molina, he hit it 387 feet into the left field seats for a go-ahead grand slam. This was the 5th grand slam of his career, tying him with Tim McCarver for second-most career grand slams by a Cardinals catcher. This <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> to be the deciding hit in this game, as the Cardinals held up to win, 8–5.|$|E
5|$|Rockefeller, who had rarely sold shares, {{held over}} 25% of Standard's stock {{at the time}} of the breakup. He and all of the other {{stockholders}} received proportionate shares in each of the 34 companies. In the aftermath, Rockefeller's control over the oil industry was somewhat reduced but over the next 10 years, the breakup <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> immensely profitable for him. The companies' combined net worth rose fivefold and Rockefeller’s personal wealth jumped to $900 million.|$|E
5|$|The Formosa Air Battle <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> {{a turning}} point for Japanese {{military}} tactics. Organized kamikaze attacks had been proposed after the First Battle of the Philippine Sea but were rejected by Imperial Japanese Navy leaders through September 1944. Only in the immediate wake of the Formosa Air Battle, when Vice Admiral Takijirō Ōnishi replaced Vice Admiral Kimpei Teraoka as leader of the IJN's 1st Air Fleet, were units specifically deployed with the intent to crash-dive enemy vessels.|$|E

5|$|The Spinks {{variety of}} avocado, Persea {{americana}} 'Spinks', {{was developed by}} William A. Spinks at his Duarte ranch between 1910 and 1920. In 1920, Spinks provided a supply of his avocados for a University of California at Berkeley and California Avocado Association comparison of avocado strains. The Spinks avocado fruit was shown to be more resistant to freezing than other avocados. They <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> to be the second-longest-lasting in storage out of the ten varieties tested.|$|E
5|$|The US Navy painted some ships sea blue overall for {{concealment}} from aircraft. During the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway, ships painted completely blue {{came under}} attack less often than ships wearing two-color schemes. On the advice of United States aviators the blue color was darkened and used extensively in the western and southern Pacific from mid-1942 through 1945 to minimize detection and identification by enemy aircraft. Dark blue <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> effective under artificial illumination during night actions. Upper surfaces of aircraft operating from carrier decks were painted a similar shade of blue. Sailors were ordered to wear dungarees rather than white uniforms when topside.|$|E
5|$|The {{storyboard}} {{took six}} months to complete. Kamei struggled with several difficulties as he was under pressure due to how it would influence the entire film. The climax of the film <b>also</b> <b>proved</b> difficult to make. He also noted how the first scene had the challenge of attracting the audience's attention. Kamei's favorite scene is when Yuri {{looks up at the}} sky of Shizontania the night before the knights' expedition to the old ruins. It meant to emphasize the importance of Yuri's decision in regards to his future.|$|E
