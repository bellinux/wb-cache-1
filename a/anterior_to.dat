5|$|The {{axillary}} {{region is}} region containing the axillary sclerites has {{in general the}} form of a scalene triangle. The base of the triangle (a-b) is the hinge of the wing with the body; the apex (c) is the distal end of the third axillary sclerite; the longer side is <b>anterior</b> <b>to</b> the apex. The point d on the anterior side of the triangle marks the articulation of the radial vein with the second axillary sclerite. The line between d and c is the plica basalis (bf), or fold of the wing {{at the base of the}} mediocubital field.|$|E
5|$|Most {{veins and}} crossveins {{occur in the}} {{anterior}} area of the remigium, {{which is responsible for}} most of the flight, powered by the thoracic muscles. The posterior portion of the remigium is sometimes called the clavus; the two other posterior fields are the anal and jugal ares. When the vannal fold has the usual position <b>anterior</b> <b>to</b> the group of anal veins, the remigium contains the costal, subcostal, radial, medial, cubital, and postcubital veins. In the flexed wing the remigiumturns posteriorly on the flexible basal connection of the radius with the second axillary, and the base of the mediocubital field is folded medially on the axillary region along the plica basalis (bf) between the median plates (m, m') of the wing base.|$|E
5|$|Mucinous, clear {{secretions}} may collect {{within these}} cysts to form either spherical masses or fusiform swellings, rarely larger than 2 to 3cm in diameter. These {{are present in}} the midline of the neck <b>anterior</b> <b>to</b> the trachea. Segments of the duct and cysts that occur high in the neck are lined by stratified squamous epithelium, which is essentially identical to that covering the posterior portion of the tongue in the region of the foramen cecum. The disorders that occur in the lower neck more proximal to the thyroid gland are lined by epithelium resembling the thyroidal acinar epithelium. Characteristically, next to the lining epithelium, there is an intense lymphocytic infiltrate. Superimposed infection may convert these lesions into abscess cavities, and rarely, give rise to cancers.|$|E

5|$|The {{lower jaw}} is rather robust. It is also {{straight}} in top view, without much expansion at the jaw tip, suggesting the lower jaws as a pair, the mandibula, were narrow. Several traits in 2008 identified as autapomorphies, later transpired {{to have been}} the result of damage. However, a unique combination of traits is present in the wide longitudinal groove on the outer side (shared with Torvosaurus), the small third dentary tooth and a vascular channel, below the row of interdental plates, that only is closed from the fifth tooth position onwards. The number of dentary teeth was probably thirteen or fourteen, though the preserved damaged specimens show at most eleven tooth sockets. The interdental plates have smooth inner sides, whereas those of the maxilla are vertically grooved; the same combination is shown by Piatnitzkysaurus. The surangular has no bony shelf, or even ridge, on its outer side. There is laterally an oval opening present in front of the jaw joint, a foramen surangulare posterior, but a second foramen surangulare <b>anterior</b> <b>to</b> the front of it is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Gross {{movement}} – such as locomotion and {{the movement}} of arms and legs – is generated in the motor cortex, divided into three parts: the primary motor cortex, found in the prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts. These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying <b>anterior</b> <b>to</b> the primary motor cortex: the premotor area and the supplementary motor area. The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts, allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a motor cortical homunculus. Impulses generated from the motor cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves. The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements. Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.|$|E
5|$|Indraloris molars {{are short}} and {{organized}} in two main lophs (lobes). They differ from Sivaladapis teeth in being shorter and broader, with a shorter talonid {{and a smaller}} hypoconulid. In Indraloris himalayensis lower molars, there are four main cusps (protoconid and metaconid in the trigonid, hypoconid and entoconid in the talonid), which give the crown a rectangular aspect, although the labial cusps (protoconid and hypoconid) are placed somewhat <b>anterior</b> <b>to</b> their lingual counterparts. In I.kamlialensis, the entoconid is distinct from the hypoconulid, which is large, but the tooth is otherwise similar. The cusps are high relative to those of extant lorises and approximately equal in height. The cristid obliqua, a crest, descends from the hypoconid to a point on the lingual side of the protoconid. On the hypoconid, this crest forms a right angle with the posterolophid, which runs towards the hypoconulid in the back lingual corner of the tooth. Between the metaconid and entoconid, the talonid basin is open. In I.himalayensis at least (the structure is damaged in the only known lower molar of I.kamlialensis) there is a well-developed hollow in the trigonid {{in front of the}} protoconid and metaconid. There is a labial cingulum between the protoconid and hypoconid. YGSP 32152 is so worn that little of its structure remains visible. It shows a short trigonid and a distinct entoconid. A small hypoconulid, close to the entoconid, is suggested by an enamel swelling. This specimen is fragmentary enough that it could also represent a catarrhine primate or a carnivoran.|$|E

5|$|The {{mandible}} is best {{represented by}} YGSP 32727, {{one of two}} specimens of the unnamed large species of Indraloris. It preserves both {{the right and left}} sides of the dentary, back {{to the level of the}} fourth lower premolars (p4), but is also damaged at the front. The jaw is deep below p4, but rapidly becomes shallower further to the front. The roots of two lower incisors and a much larger canine are preserved; the three roots cluster together, with the canine root above the incisor roots, suggesting that these teeth shared some function. The mental foramen, an opening in the jawbone, is below p4. A root for the deciduous second premolar (dp2) is preserved on both the left and right sides, but the tooth itself is not and it is not possible to determine whether dp2 had one or two roots. The right permanent second premolar (p2) is unerupted, but partially visible; it is a blade-shaped cutting tooth. The p3 bears a single cusp, somewhat <b>anterior</b> <b>to</b> the middle of the tooth, with crests descending from it towards the front and back, and weak cingula on the inner and outer sides. It is supported by two roots, which are close together.|$|E
