500|$|Critics {{generally}} {{favored the}} songs accompanying music video, in particular Scherzinger's intricate choreography. On {{the day the}} video premiered, a reviewer from Rap-Up wrote [...] "It’s getting hot in here," [...] referencing Scherzinger's [...] "smokin’ body" [...] and [...] "steamy visuals". Staff of Idolator spoke favorably of Scherzinger's choreography, stating that it [...] "would make the other Pussycat Dolls blush". Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush gave the video a positive review stating that she was impressed of Scherzinger's athletic and acrobatic methods of dancing. She continued, [...] "she doesn’t even {{have to try and}} be sexy; she just is". Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy appreciated Scherzinger's writhing around on the floor in [...] "somewhat compromising positions" [...] and added that Scherzinger is wet for about 50 percent of the video, so [...] "we're guessing guys across the country aren't going to be writing complaint letters anytime soon." [...] Sophie Forbes of Daily Mail positively stated [...] "Clutching a net round her body, she looked sensational in her taupe two piece <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> wistfully off into the distance." [...] David Griffiths of 4Music positively reviewed the song's music video stating it [...] "featur some jaw-droppingly good dancing, a hair flick or two and some serious thrusting, it gets a big thumbs up from us." [...] "Wet" [...] ranked at number 70 on MTV's most watched music videos of 2011.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{eventually}} revealed that Tahwaan {{was once a}} homosexual male who had undergone a sex change {{so that he could}} marry Dr. Tar.

[...] The Ōgiya was a large, {{long-established}} shop in Yoshiwara, and Hanaōgi built her reputation in the 1780s for her beauty and her skills in singing, playing the koto, the tea ceremony, the Chinese classics, and incense.|$|R
5000|$|A young maidservant {{bends over}} to wring out linen {{with her hands}} <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> provocatively at the viewer with a sensual, flirting glance. She appears unkempt, wearing clothes which cover her body and red mules on her feet, but her ankle and foot are exposed {{suggesting}} a lack of sexual restraint. [...] A marabout, a kettle used for boiling water, is seated on a small table in the lower left frame.|$|R
60|$|Polly Ann {{looked at}} him like a frightened doe. And <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared,</b> {{uncertain}} whether to stay or fly, the color surged into her cheeks and mounted to her fair forehead.|$|E
60|$|And even <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> {{the mound}} above her swayed and crumbled, and {{a rush of}} hot water came pouring over her. Then {{it seemed to her}} that she was dragged downward....|$|E
6000|$|... "You!"--the {{deep voice}} was unnaturally full and strong, and the girl's wide-opened eyes {{burned in the}} dusk <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> him through and through. [...] "Then you're the Boy--my Brushwood Boy, and I've known you all my life!" ...|$|E
50|$|The episode ends on {{the theme}} of Power. Lynette is seen looking in her car mirror, and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> at herself, <b>she</b> slowly lets her hair down to how Rick likes it. Tom is left at home with no power as his wife takes control over the pizzeria. Gabrielle and Victor {{celebrate}} their engagement and Victor’s growing success in the polls, while Carlos and Edie continue their relationship without hiding it from Mike. Susan takes off her engagement ring and is free from both Mike and Ian for the time being, while Mrs. McCluskey is left alone in the dark in a prison cell.|$|R
500|$|As part of {{photographer}} Annie Leibovitz's Disney Dream Portrait Series {{that she}} has been commissioning for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts since 2007, The Walt Disney Company hired American country singer-songwriter Taylor Swift to be featured as the model for Rapunzel. In {{a detailed description of the}} piece, Us Weekly wrote, [...] "The stunning image — captioned 'Where a world of adventure awaits' — shows the 23-year-old Grammy winner perched on the window ledge of a moss-covered stone tower. A pink petticoat peeks out from under her purple gown <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> wistfully into the distance, her long golden tresses flowing regally in the wind." [...] Swift told On The Red Carpet that she was honored.|$|R
50|$|Lorraine {{takes him}} to an old mine, and shows him a dark hole {{that leads to a}} caved in lower shaft. She and Hex journey down, and it is {{revealed}} that Lorraine has murdered at least fifteen men. Grabbing a knife, Lorraine tries once more to kill Hex, who punches her and secures Red's body. Lorraine comes to just as Hex reaches the top and kicks down the rope trapping her there. Lorraine first pleads that they can be partners, then tells Hex he can't leave her. Hex says she has plenty of companions whom she knows, then departs. Lorraine trembles <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> at the dead bodies, the only lamp in the shaft slowly going out, leaving her trapped in the dark.|$|R
6000|$|He too was in evening dress, and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> {{at him in}} {{surprise}} he laughingly protested. [...] "Please don't scrutinize this coat too closely. It's the only one I've owned for ten years, {{and this is the}} only house in which I'd dare to wear it." ...|$|E
60|$|He nodded familiarly to Miss Eversleigh, {{and turned}} away with Miss Avondale, who waved her usual smiling {{patronage}} to Randolph, even including his companion in that half-amused, half-superior salutation. Perhaps it was this that put a sudden hauteur into the young girl's expression <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> at Miss Avondale's departing figure.|$|E
6000|$|The girl {{leaned forward}} a little, drawing {{in her breath}} <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> down the valley. The voices drowned the sound she fancied she had heard, and the colour came and went in her face when she caught one of them. [...] "The thing's no better than robbery. Why isn't Harry Alton or his partner here?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{main focus}} of this illustration, Salome, floats in midair and in her hands she holds the head of John the Baptist just after she kissed it, {{depicting}} the final words said by Salome in the play [...] "J’ai baisé ta bouche Iokanaan, j’ai baisé ta bouche" [...] ("I have kissed your mouth, Jokannan, I have kissed your mouth"). Her hair billows in snake-like tendrils above her <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> powerfully {{into the eyes of}} John the Baptist. His severed head drips blood that nourishes the phallic lily. The flower also symbolizes purity. Composing the background behind these two figures is a white quarter section of the moon and a stylized depiction of peacock feathers, a signature motif in Beardsley's illustrations, made of concentric circles.|$|R
6000|$|As {{the curtain}} rises, Eileen is {{discovered}} {{standing in the}} [...] middle of the road, front centre. Her face shows white and clear in [...] the bright moonlight <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> with anxious expectancy up the [...] road to the left. Her body is fixed in an attitude of rigid [...] immobility <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> were afraid the slightest movement would break [...] the spell of silence and awaken the unknown. She has shrunk [...] instinctively as far away <b>as</b> <b>she</b> can from the mysterious darkness [...] which rises at the roadsides like an imprisoning wall. A sound of [...] hurried footfalls, muffled by the dust, comes from the road she is [...] watching. She gives a startled gasp. Her eyes strain to identify [...] the oncomer. Uncertain, trembling with fright, she hesitates a [...] second; then darts {{to the side of}} the road and crouches down in the [...] shadow.|$|R
5000|$|One {{night after}} Joe Paulson storms {{out of his}} house in a fake temper trantrum (a ruse so he can meet up with Nancy Voss), Deputy Paulson is {{astonished}} when the host of her favorite television program, She-Devils, begins talking directly to her. The host tells her that Joe is having an affair and the show's contestants demand that she kill Joe. The next day, Becka Paulson builds a device with instructions given to her by the television set. When Joe walks in the house, he becomes annoyed by the television program and wants Becka to turn it off, but Becka shouts at him to do it himself and he is then electrocuted <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> in horror. Becka goes insane, and is placed in a psychiatric hospital (where she drones on about the [...] "tommyknockers").|$|R
60|$|Still she was silent, {{until he}} {{wondered}} {{whether she would}} answer him. He had often speculated to himself how she would take this decision, but he could make no surmise from her expression <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> off into the wood. Presently she turned her head, slowly, and looked into his face. Still she did not speak.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is all so horrible," [...] said Grace, bending {{back her}} head, so that as I glanced over my {{shoulder}} I could see her firm white neck through the laces <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> upward at the streak of blue sky so far above. Then she turned her face toward me again, {{and it seemed to}} my excited fancy that it had grown ethereal.|$|E
6000|$|Carl {{retired to}} a chair beside the Morris chair, fidgeting. [...] "Can you beat it! Is this Gertie and me?" [...] he inquired in a {{parenthesis}} in his heart. For a second, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> haughtily at him, he spitefully recalled the fact that Gertie had once discarded him for a glee-club dentist. But he submerged the thought and listened with a rather forced big-brother air as she repented of her anger and went on: ...|$|E
500|$|She {{then walks}} past several people, dances with several {{men and women}} in white and black suits and dresses, as the second chorus begins. Beyoncé and the dancers perform a dance routine together, and soon she meets a man, who dances with her. A {{particular}} scene shows all the dancers crouch down to the floor, and follow Beyoncé <b>as</b> <b>she</b> walks, before she blows them back. [...] The bridge starts, and the video moves to Beyoncé in a red room, where she and her dancers dance in short skirts, fishnets and black sparkling dresses. The group is later dance in the red and white rooms together. Leading into the final chorus, Beyoncé dances back in the room with the dancers, while Rowland, Williams and her sister sit on a black couch. As the video ends, Beyoncé {{stands in front of the}} mirror she was at the start and fades to black <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> at the viewer through it.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. CLANDON. What {{on earth}} {{are they going to}} do? (Going out.) I really must go and stop this--- (She follows them, {{speaking}} <b>as</b> <b>she</b> disappears. Gloria <b>stares</b> coolly at Valentine, and then deliberately looks at her watch.) ...|$|R
6000|$|June {{gazed at}} her intently, with a {{look in her eyes}} as if her {{conscience}} had suddenly leaped up into them; it passed; and an even more intent look took its place, <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> had <b>stared</b> that conscience out of countenance. She replied imperiously: ...|$|R
60|$|The girls laughed, and Josie blushed <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> at {{the tall}} man, {{conscious}} {{that she had}} leaped before she looked. They made a pretty contrast, these two young cousins--one as fair as a lily, the other a little wild rose. And Dan gave a nod of satisfaction as he surveyed them; for he had seen many bonny girls in his travels, and was glad that these old friends were blooming so beautifully.|$|E
60|$|Before her, on {{the edge}} of the shrubbery, a grey figure stood erect and graceful, and the face, with its thin lips faintly smiling, its dark eyes gleaming, was the face of Anthony Wilding. And <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> he moved forward, and she heard the fall of his foot upon the turf, the clink of his spurs, the swish of his {{scabbard}} against the shrubs, and reason told her that this was no ghost.|$|E
60|$|For {{several seconds}} Hetty stood silent, {{recognizing}} that what Torrance might smile at in his guest would appear almost {{a crime in}} his daughter, but still horribly unwilling. Then, as Flora Schuyler, with a half-impatient gesture, signed to Grant, she touched a little gong, and {{a few moments later}} her maid met them in the corridor. The girl stopped suddenly, gasping a little <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> at Grant, until Hetty grasped her arm, nipping it cruelly.|$|E
60|$|The {{problem is}} insoluble. The body is {{harnessed}} to a brain. Beauty {{goes hand in}} hand with stupidity. There she sat staring at the fire <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had <b>stared</b> at the broken mustard-pot. In spite of defending indecency, Jacob doubted whether he liked it in the raw. He had a violent reversion towards male society, cloistered rooms, and the works of the classics; and was ready to turn with wrath upon whoever it was who had fashioned life thus.|$|R
5000|$|Kip tells Fiona that he {{is going}} to Sante Fe, New Mexico with Ben for a while, because they need some time apart and he {{ultimately}} needs to know what he wants to do next. Despite their impending separation, they decide to keep good memories of their time together and wish each other well. Later, Fiona announces her separation to Austen and tells him that now they can be together. When Austen appears to be worried, Fiona assures him that they can take things slow because she isn't divorcing Kip yet. However, Gina comes onto the video screen, saying that she took four pregnancy tests, all positive, and tells Austen that they are having quadruplets. She then realises that Fiona was watching her at this moment. Austen assures Fiona [...] "It's not how it looks." [...] <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> in shock on the fact that her best friend may be pregnant with her potential lover's child. A confused Gina says the final words of the season: [...] "How does it look?" ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{begins with}} an {{overview}} of music technology today, its history and current status. The development of MIDI, digital sound synthesis, and CD audio are mentioned. Developments in music software designed assisted instruction are placed in six categories: drill-and-practice, flexible practice, guided instruction, games, exploratory, and creative. The article continues by offering examples of commercial software from these categories that are appropriate for young children. Screen shots of each program are offered, together with comments about how each title works. Research on the young child and music technology is included, with references to work done in and outside of music education. The article ends {{with the notion that}} teachers are always the key to quality instruction in music and music technology is only a tool in the process. s I write these words, the year-ending holiday season is upon us and television commercials about the wonders of technology abound. My favorite one features a JL young girl seated in front of a modern personal computer. She seems to be doing a report for school on a music topic <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> up at a colorful screen of jazz musician...|$|R
60|$|Down {{the slope}} he thundered, {{and the sound}} of his horse's hoofs came to the ears of Suzanne, who, frozen with terror, {{crouched}} in the grass near the spring at the foot of it. Turning her eyes from the ridge where she had seen the Zulus, she looked behind her. At first she could see nothing except a great horse with a man upon its back, but <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared,</b> presently she recognised the horse--it was the schimmel, and none other.|$|E
60|$|How {{long this}} state of things {{continued}} Dorothy could not even guess, she was so greatly bewildered. But bye and bye, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> ahead into the black chasm with a beating heart, she began to dimly see {{the form of the}} horse Jim--his head up in the air, his ears erect and his long legs sprawling in every direction as he tumbled through space. Also, turning her head, she found that she could see the boy beside her, who had until now remained as still and silent as she herself.|$|E
60|$|This was {{the obvious}} {{explanation}} of the child's sudden disappearance and equally abrupt discovery. There remained, however, {{the problem of the}} interloping baby, which now sat whimpering on the lawn in a disfavour as chilling as its previous popularity had been unwelcome. The Momebys glared at it as though it had wormed its way into their short-lived affections by heartless and unworthy pretences. Miss Gilpet's face took on an ashen tinge <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> helplessly at the bunched-up figure that had been such a gladsome sight to her eyes a few moments ago.|$|E

"Yes, yes, <b>she</b> is <b>as</b> {{much like}} you <b>as</b> <b>she</b> can <b>stare.</b> I never saw {{as great a}} resemblance, {{excepting}} between you and Lady Juliana--Lady Juliana, Emmy, was a beauty in her day; very like her uncle, old Admiral Griffin--you can't remember the admiral--he lost an eye in a battle with the Dutch, and part of his cheek in a frigate, when a young man fighting the Dons. Oh, he was a pleasant old gentleman; many a guinea has he given me when I was a boy at school." ...|$|R

6000|$|Mrs. Brinkley {{considered}} {{this a little}} too bold, a little too brazen. Had they actually come South in pursuit of him? It was shameless, and she let Mrs. Pasmer know something of her feeling in the shortness with which she answered, [...] "I saw him in Washington the other day--for a moment." [...] She shortened {{the time she had}} spent in Dan's company so as to cut Mrs. Pasmer off from as much comfort <b>as</b> possible, and <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> at her in open astonishment.|$|R
