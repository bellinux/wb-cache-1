25|$|From the mid 80s {{until the}} early 90s, mullets were popular in {{suburban}} and rural areas among working-class men. This contrasted with a conservative look preferred by business professionals, with neatly groomed short hair for men <b>and</b> <b>sleek,</b> straight hair for women. Some men also wore bangs in styles such as regular frontal or side swept bangs {{but they were not}} as big as women or girls bangs. Hairsprays such as AquaNet were also used in excess by fans of glam metal bands such as Poison.|$|E

500|$|Most press {{reviews for}} [...] "The Long Bright Dark" [...] were very positive, {{although}} some reviewers criticized the dialogue {{and other aspects}} of the program.

50|$|Around issue 35, {{the comic}} {{began to develop}} a more {{polished}} look, with brighter highlights <b>and</b> <b>sleeker</b> lines. Onwards from 35, Haque has continued to develop this sleek, shiny appearance in the comic, lending itself {{to the establishment of}} such characters as Eve, who, being artificial, requires a slightly sharper, more technological look than the human cast. Also, as the comic progressed, the skin tones of several different characters darkened considerably.|$|R

500|$|The seal from 1752 {{is shown}} in Figure 2. The beaver honored Albany's past as an {{important}} fur trading port. Adding {{to the history of}} this seal, one historian states, [...] " [...] displays the beaver, but looking in the original, more like a drowned cat than the fat <b>and</b> <b>sleek</b> animal, it was intended to represent. Neither the resolution nor the records state why the change was made." [...] In 1755 the original seal (Figure 1) was reinstated for use by the mayor in licensing businesses. So at this point the city had two seals, one corporate and one public. The earlier seal, however, was last seen in 1761 and the beaver continued as the sole city seal from then on.|$|E
500|$|Speed2 was {{produced}} by De Bont's production company, Blue Tulip, {{and he was one}} the film's three co-producers along with Steve Perry and Michaer Peyser. While Speed {{was produced}} for $30 million, the sequel was green-lit at [...] "just under $100 million" [...] due to the larger production and higher cast salaries. The director began working on pre-production prior to the release of his previous film, Twister (1996). He started location scouting in the Caribbean in May 1996, and chose Saint Martin as the primary filming location because he felt it was least likely to be subjected to a hurricane. For the cruise ship on which the film would be set, De Bont visited ships from various cruise lines and ultimately chose Seabourn Legend for its luxurious amenities <b>and</b> <b>sleek</b> design.|$|E
500|$|The Paul Whiteman Orchestra was {{the most}} popular and highest paid band of the day. In spite of Whiteman's nickname, [...] "The King of Jazz", his was not a jazz ensemble, but a popular music outfit that played bits of jazz and {{classical}} music according to the demands of its record-buying and concert-going audience. Whiteman was perhaps best known for having premiered George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue in New York in 1924, and the orchestrator of that piece, Ferde Grofé, continued to be {{an important part of the}} band in 1928. At three hundred pounds, Whiteman was huge both physically and culturally—"a man flabby, virile, quick, coarse, untidy <b>and</b> <b>sleek,</b> with a hard core of shrewdness in an envelope of sentimentalism," [...] according to a 1926 New Yorker profile. And many Beiderbecke partisans have turned Whiteman into a villain in the years since.|$|E

50|$|The monkey wrench, {{known as}} gas grips in the UK, is an {{adjustable}} wrench, a later American development of eighteenth-century English coach wrenches.

The term monkey wrench is also used colloquially to refer to the pipe wrench, owing to their broadly similar shapes.|$|R
500|$|Michael Menachem of Billboard {{said that}} the [...] "stateside version" [...] turns up the heat with Ludacris' feature as [...] "Cruz's breezy vocals on this electro-pop number have all the warmth of smooth R, while {{producer}} Fraser T Smith sets up the right ratio of catchy vocals and tempo changes to make a hit". Ash Dosanjh of New Musical Express said that Cruz's downfall was when he acts the player, as on [...] "Break Your Heart" [...] and [...] "Dirty Picture". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian said Cruz was [...] "proficient but generic" [...] in the song, but his [...] "autotuned vocals could have been anyone's, and this facelessness is a problem Cruz rarely surmounts."

500|$|Minogue's tenth record X was a {{move back}} to her pop roots.

[...] However, critics said the album did not feature enough [...] "consistency" [...] and Chris True called the tracks [...] "cold, calculated dance-pop numbers." [...] However, he said her eleventh album Aphrodite [...] "rarely strays past sweet love songs or happy dance anthems" [...] and [...] "the main sound is the kind of glittery disco pop that really is her strong suit." [...] Tim Sendra from Allmusic stated, [...] "The various producers keep their eyes on the dancefloor throughout, crafting shiny <b>and</b> <b>sleek</b> tracks that sound custom-built to blast out of huge speaker columns" [...] and found Aphrodite [...] "One of her best, in fact." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Thriller" [...] is a {{contemporary}} critical favourite.

[...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times noted that 'Billie Jean', 'Beat It', 'Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' ' and [...] "the movie in the song 'Thriller'", were the songs, unlike the [...] "fluff" [...] "P.Y.T.", that were [...] "the hits that made Thriller a world-beater; along with Mr. Jackson's stage and video presence, listeners must have identified with his willingness to admit terror." [...] Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times described [...] "Thriller" [...] as [...] "adequately groovy" [...] with a [...] "funked-out beat" [...] and lyrics [...] "seemingly lifted from some little kid's 'scary storybook'".|$|E
2500|$|The first-generation Hudson Hornets {{featured}} a functional [...] "step-down" [...] design with dropped floorpan and a chassis {{with a lower}} center of gravity than contemporary vehicles that helped the car handle well – a bonus for racing. The Hornet's lower <b>and</b> <b>sleeker</b> look was accentuated by streamlined styling, sometimes called [...] "ponton" [...] styling.

By season 18, both script editor Christopher H Bidmead and producer John Nathan-Turner were eager to downplay the device as much as possible.|$|R
