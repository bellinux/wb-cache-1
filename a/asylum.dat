5|$|<b>Asylum</b> {{digitally}} created {{weapons for}} various scenes. In {{the scene in}} which Nolan is killed suddenly by {{a shot in the}} head from Jason's arrow, <b>Asylum</b> created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in the back. The shot of a hatchet flying through the airin one instance appearing in the same frame as the actorwould be too difficult to achieve practically. <b>Asylum</b> rendered a complete 3D model of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which it hits the character in the back. One of the final images added by <b>Asylum</b> was for Trent's death scene. Here, <b>Asylum</b> digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him onto the back of a tow truck.|$|E

Northcote was taken over by the Government of Victoria in 1890 and converted into a public inebriate retreat. [...] Brightside and Lara Inebriate Retreats were opened soon after, and many alcoholics were moved out of the lunatic <b>asylums.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{continental}} Europe, universities often {{played a}} part in the administration of the <b>asylums.</b> In Germany, many practising psychiatrists were educated in universities associated with particular <b>asylums.</b> However, because Germany remained a loosely bound conglomerate of individual states, it lacked a national regulatory framework for <b>asylums.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>asylums</b> {{created by}} the Charity Organization Societies {{are the source of}} much of the {{criticism}} of the Scientific Charity Movement. Their purpose was to remove the [...] "defective classes" [...] from society. Members of society who were classified as the [...] "defective class" [...] were placed in <b>asylums</b> most of which were made of the remnants of the poorhouses. These <b>asylums</b> had been founded as a means to remove the defective classes, based on the idea of social Darwinism, from the genepool. Some of these <b>asylums</b> allowed their residents to be experimented on by scientists of the time. Many of these <b>asylums</b> would continue on long after the Scientific Charity Movement was over and into the late 1960s.|$|R

David Tapp, a police officer who had his throat damaged by Jigsaw's knife and was later shot in the chest by a suspect named Zep Hindle, has been healed and is brought to Whitehurst insane <b>asylum,</b> an abandoned sanitarium with a reputation for medieval tactics and frequent patient abuse. The <b>asylum</b> has many areas, most of which contain a key trap scene for Tapp to solve. A large part of the <b>asylum</b> consists of cells that were at one time used to hold the criminally insane. Jigsaw placed traps all around the <b>asylum</b> to continue his tests of will for Detective Tapp and his apprentice, Amanda Young, who monitors Tapp as the story progresses.|$|E
5|$|In Saw, The Jigsaw Killer has healed Detective David Tapp {{from his}} gunshot wound, and places {{him in an}} {{abandoned}} insane <b>asylum</b> to teach him a lesson in life appreciation. Obsessed, Tapp traverses the <b>asylum</b> and gathers clues along the way in hopes of finally apprehending Jigsaw. As he progresses through the <b>asylum,</b> he encounters several people with past and current connections to him, whom he must save. The <b>asylum</b> also has inhabitants who are in games of their own, ordered to kill Tapp. Along the way, Tapp uncovers the origins of Jigsaw and the motives behind his tests. The development team brought in the Saw creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell {{to help with the}} storyline and create new trap designs exclusive to the game.|$|E
5|$|Rocksteady {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a sequel before development of Arkham <b>Asylum</b> had concluded, developing ideas for both the story and setting so the games' narratives could be effectively connected; a secret room was hidden in the <b>asylum</b> warden's office in Arkham <b>Asylum</b> containing hints of how the sequel would progress, including blueprints for the Arkham City prison; the blueprints are quite similar to its final layout in Arkham City. The original idea was to take the game out of the <b>asylum</b> setting and onto the streets of Gotham City while retaining the level of design detail put into the <b>asylum.</b> To that end they wanted to include locations from the Batman mythos that were notable and meaningful to the character, instead of a series of generic streets; Rocksteady was initially unsure how technical considerations would limit the scope of this idea.|$|E
50|$|The Government of Victoria {{originally}} intended that Yarra Bend would be closed once Kew, Ararat and Beechworth <b>asylums</b> were established. However, {{the gold rush}} caused a population explosion in the colony, increasing {{the burden on the}} new <b>asylums.</b> This was compounded by the practice of housing 'inebriates', 'idiots' and 'imbeciles' at lunatic <b>asylums</b> up until the 1880s.|$|R

50|$|The County <b>Asylums</b> Act 1808 formed {{mental health}} law in England and Wales from 1808 to 1845. Notably, the <b>Asylums</b> Act {{established}} public mental <b>asylums</b> in Britain.

5|$|The Licensed Victuallers' National <b>Asylum</b> (now Caroline Gardens), an {{extensive}} almshouse estate off Old Kent Road at <b>Asylum</b> Road, opened in 1827. Its first patron was Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex who {{was followed by}} Prince Albert and Prince Edward.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{national}} systems of regulated <b>asylums</b> for the mentally ill had been established in most industrialized countries.

The United States housed 150,000 patients in mental hospitals by 1904. Germany housed more than 400 public and private sector <b>asylums.</b> These <b>asylums</b> were critical to the evolution of psychiatry as they provided places of practice throughout the world.|$|R

5|$|The {{producers}} used <b>Asylum</b> Visual Effects {{to create}} digital effects for Friday the 13th. Although director Marcus Nispel is {{a proponent of}} practical effects, <b>Asylum</b> had to digitally create some shots to protect the actors and to allow the director to achieve a specific look. Visual effects supervisor Mitchell Drain assigned ten crew members {{to work on the}} visual effects; they first analyzed the script in pre-production to decide which shots would need digital effects. <b>Asylum</b> worked on 25 shots for the film.|$|E
5|$|A {{large area}} of the grounds between the <b>asylum</b> main {{buildings}} and Princess Street was allocated to Children's Cottages in 1885. When the Children's Cottages became a separate institution, the area surrounding the cottages became no longer under <b>asylum</b> management and was no longer for <b>asylum</b> inmate use. Widening and straightening of Princess Street in 1939-1940 resulted in the demolishing of Kew's gatehouses, loss of land and the relocation of the main gates to Victoria Park, Kew.

This act was passed by the House of Commons by 362 votes to 74 in June 2002 and by the House of Lords – at the ninth attempt, following concern about the introduction of measures allowing for the detention of <b>asylum</b> seekers in rural areas) – in November 2002.|$|E

The eighteenth century, in which mental illness {{was seen as a}} punishment from God, precedes the moral treatment <b>asylums.</b> Twentieth-century thinking favored a medical view in which mental illness can be treated or controlled with medical drugs. <b>Asylums</b> built in the nineteenth century relied on “moral ” treatments— treatments that utilized no restraints unless absolutely necessary and used the environment and architecture to influence the human mind.
