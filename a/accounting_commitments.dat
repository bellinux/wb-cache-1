40|$|We {{report the}} results of a field {{experiment}} that randomly offered Malawian smallholder farmers formal savings accounts. We tested two primary treatments, offering either: 1) “ordinary” accounts, or 2) both ordinary and “commitment ” <b>accounts.</b> <b>Commitment</b> <b>accounts</b> allowed customers to restrict access to their own funds until a future date of their choosing. A control group was not offered any account but was tracked alongside the treatment groups. The commitment treatment led to increases in deposits at the partner bank, and over the next agricultural year caused increases in agricultural input use, crop sales, and household expenditures. The effects of the commitment treatment are not due to literally “tying the hands” of farmers, since farmers in that treatment mostly saved in ordinary <b>accounts</b> (rather than <b>commitment</b> <b>accounts).</b> We discuss other possible channels through which the commitment treatment’s effects may have operated, such as reduced sharing with one’s social network as wel...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine the}} case made by Christopher McMahon for {{managerial}} democracy. Specifically, I examine {{the extent to}} which McMahon’s account is able to address a series of objections against the case for managerial democracy as articulated by Thomas Christiano. Christiano articulates two sets of objections. First, Christiano argues that McMahon does not succeed in ruling out the possibility that managerial authority is best understood as promissory in its basis, in which case there is no presumption in favor of its democratic exercise. Second, Christiano raises a series of objections to the effect that even if we accept McMahon’s account of the nature of managerial authority, the conclusion for the democratic exercise of that authority by workers at the level of individual economic enterprises does not follow. In the end, I argue that McMahon’s account contains the resources to address these objections if one adopts a specific view about the moral limits to relationships that involve the submission of the will on the part of one person to another. Adoption of this view, however, appears to {{come at the expense of}} what I take to be the <b>account’s</b> <b>commitment</b> to liberalism. As such, what I understand this paper to reflect more generally is the apparent difficulty for liberals in arguing that there is something inherently morally troubling about capitalist work relations.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a simple stochastic model {{of international trade}} with three countries. Two of the three countries are in an economic union. Comparisons are made between equilibrium welfare for these two countries under fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes. Within the model it is shown that flexible exchange rate regimes generate greater welfare. However, we then consider comparisons of welfare when the two countries also engage in some international assistance in order to share risk. Such risk-sharing is limited by enforcement constraints of cross border assistance. It is shown that taking into <b>account</b> limited <b>commitment</b> risk-sharing fixed exchange rates or currency areas can dominate flexible exchange rate regimes reversing the previous result...|$|R

A critical question is: "What is the relationship between an account of human rights and corresponding ethical commitments?" Here Searle's account runs into problems.

40|$|The {{importance}} of ethics to the accounting profession {{is well established}} (Turpen and Witmer, 1997; Abdolmohammadi, Read, and Scarbrough, 2003; Guffey and McCartney, 2008). In <b>accounting,</b> a <b>commitment</b> to ethical behavior {{is regarded as the}} basis for all other performance standards, (Turpen et al., 1997), and historically most agree that accountants practice honest principles (Leitsch, 2006). However, business headlines such as those related to the collapse of Enron and its auditor, Arthur Andersen, raise concerns about ethical actions of accountants (Abdolmohammadi et al., 2003). Additionally, accountants and auditors have more recently come under fire due to issues related to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Freddie Mac, and the business ventures of Bernie Madoff among others. In reaction to these and other issues, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) increased emphasis placed on ethics in their certification examinations and the AICPA updated their code of professional conduct (AICPA Code of Professional Conduct, Statement of Ethical Professional Practice) ...|$|R

40|$|Our {{evaluation}} of 16 prominent Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) methodologies revealed {{at least two}} shortcomings in each methodology: Firstly, most are lacking in either agent internal design, agent interaction design and/or agent organization modeling. Secondly, most ignore system extensibility, interoperability and reusability issues. In response to these shortcomings, we synthesize a methodological framework for ontology-centric AOSE which incorporates the key concerns for MAS development and addresses the concerns about reuse and interoperability. The proposed framework is targeted at developing ontology-based multi-agent systems (MAS) in heterogeneous environments and it takes into <b>account</b> ontological <b>commitments</b> of agents throughout the analysis and design processes. The proposed methodological framework {{can be used in}} two major ways: as the foundation to build new ontology-centric AOSE methodologies from scratch, or as a repository of add-on methodological elements that can be added to an existing AOSE methodology to enhance it with new support for ontology-based AOSE.
