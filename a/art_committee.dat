25|$|The {{cultural}} {{life of the}} city has also benefited from the Society's attentions. On its recommendation, the City Council set up an Advisory <b>Art</b> <b>Committee</b> in 1922; it {{played a critical role}} in saving the Repertory Theatre from closure in 1924, and again in 193435. The link with the Repertory Theatre continues through ex officio membership of the Sir Barry Jackson Trust which holds the shares of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre Ltd. The Centenary Concert for Birmingham Town Hall in 1934 was organised in the manner and form suggested by the Society jointly with the City of Birmingham Orchestra.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1869, Zeshin was {{commissioned}} {{to work for}} the Imperial government, and created many works of art for them which are sadly no longer extant. These included a set of gold-lacquered chairs for the Imperial Palace decorated in a sakura (cherry blossom) motif. He was later made Japan's official representative to several international expositions, including Vienna in 1873, Philadelphia the following year, and Paris. One year before his death in 1891, Zeshin was granted the immense honor of membership in the newly created Imperial <b>Art</b> <b>Committee</b> and is uptoday the only one artist who has been recognized in 2 fields (painting and maki-e) of work. The honor of Imperial Commissioned Artists was only granted to 53 artists between 1890 and 1944.|$|E

500|$|Upon public release, Rebirth design {{became a}} [...] "target for ridicule". In June 2011, Milwaukie {{neighborhood}} association leaders {{sent a letter}} to the Public Art Advisory Committee expressing their disappointment with the proposed deer concept, hoping to see changes to its final design. Some residents thought the sculpture should be more accessible and less expensive; conversely, the Oak Lodge Community Council chairwoman, who also served as a member of the <b>art</b> <b>committee,</b> hoped the sculpture could serve as a community space and reach [...] "icon" [...] status. In a formal letter, TriMet's general manager responded to the neighborhood associations by encouraging residents to [...] "communicate directly with the <b>art</b> <b>committee</b> by inviting members to neighborhood association leadership meetings". The agency's spokeswoman also told committee leaders that the public was welcome to share their preferences regarding the work's dimensions, fabrication methods, form, and materials. Oak Grove and Milwaukie residents also disagreed about whether or not those in the latter city had a say about the sculpture, which would have been within the area's boundaries according to the first design.|$|E
500|$|The Chair of the House of Commons Works of <b>Art</b> <b>Committee,</b> Frank Doran MP, {{had been}} {{concerned}} {{by the appearance of}} the sculpture and enquired of the Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, Ed Vaizey MP, what plans there were for its care and maintenance. Vaizey replied that the House of Commons should take ownership of the statue and responsibility for its care. Vaizey subsequently described Knife Edge Two Piece as [...] "one of the most televised works of art in London". Restoration work was originally planned to be completed in time for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, but was not begun until February 2013.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1919, the Smithsonian Institution {{entered into}} a {{cooperative}} endeavor with the American Federation of Arts and the American Mission to Negotiate Peace to create a National <b>Art</b> <b>Committee.</b> [...] The committee's goal was to commission portraits of famous leaders from the various nations involved in World War I. Among the committee's members were oil company executive Herbert L. Pratt, Ethel Sperry Crocker (an art aficionado and wife of William Henry Crocker, founder of Crocker National Bank), architect Abram Garfield, Mary Williamson Averell (wife of railway executive E. H. Harriman), financier J. P. Morgan, attorney Charles Phelps Taft (brother of President William Howard Taft), steel magnate Henry Clay Frick, and paleontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott.

I most certainly won't miss the constituency work. I've got to tell you that honestly. It's 22 years of the same cases, but just the faces and the people changing. It might sound a little disparaging to say this about people's lives and their problems and we did deal with them ... but I got no satisfaction from this at all. I really didn't. And all you were was a sort of high-powered social worker and perhaps not even a good one at that. I will miss being chairman of the works of <b>art</b> <b>committee</b> [...] [...] [...] because I was having so much intellectual enjoyment, and indeed just straightforward fun, out of reorganising our collection, and that kept me in touch with history." ...|$|E
