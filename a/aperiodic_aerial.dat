25|$|Even {{minor changes}} in the weather, {{physical}} layout or even bumping the chassis containing the tunable capacitors can cause the tuning to vary. For this reason a variety of systems were used to decrease {{the sensitivity of the}} radiogoniometer to mis-tuning. Primary among these was the <b>aperiodic</b> <b>aerial</b> concept, which described the mechanical layout of the radiogoniometer's internal wiring. By winding the sense coil wiring around a vertical cylinder, and wiring the field coils in a similar arrangement {{as close as possible to}} the sense coil, the entire circuit became capacitively coupled. A single tunable capacitor on the output from the sense coil could then be used to tune the entire system.|$|E
