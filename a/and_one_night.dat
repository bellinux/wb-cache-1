50|$|<b>One</b> Hundred <b>and</b> <b>One</b> <b>Nights</b> (Kitâb Fîhi Hadîth Mi'at Layla wa Layla) {{is a book}} of Arab {{literature}} {{consisting of}} twenty stories, which presents many similarities to the more famous <b>One</b> Thousand <b>and</b> <b>One</b> <b>Nights.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{themes and}} {{narrative}} structure {{are very similar}} to those of the <b>One</b> Thousand <b>and</b> <b>One</b> <b>Nights</b> — having as setting the immense Muslim world, the stories talk about intrepid travellers, epic and romantic adventures, and enigmas, desires and wonders, which enchant the reader. Besides the other similarities to the <b>One</b> Thousand <b>and</b> <b>One</b> <b>Nights,</b> <b>One</b> Hundred <b>and</b> <b>One</b> <b>Nights</b> has the same heroine — Scheherazade — but it is thought to be older. With the exception of the tales of “The Ebony Horse” and the “Seven Viziers”, also present in “One Thousand <b>and</b> <b>One</b> Nights”, the stories are different in the two works. However, the spirit of both is the same and the scholars consider that the reading of each one of them complements the other and allows a more complete appreciation of mediaeval Arabian literature. According to Claudia Ott, while <b>One</b> Thousand <b>and</b> <b>One</b> <b>Nights</b> talks about the Eastern Arab world, <b>One</b> Hundred <b>and</b> <b>One</b> <b>Nights</b> takes place in the Western Arab world.|$|R
5|$|NSB also {{operates}} {{intercity services}} from Trondheim to Bodø on the Nordland Line.

CargoNet and Cargolink operate freight trains along the line. CargoNet hauls using Vossloh Euro, while Cargolink uses Di 6 locomotives, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{partially}} cast with stock actors that Corman had used in previous films. Writer Charles B. Griffith portrays several small roles. Griffith's father {{appears as a}} dental patient, and his grandmother, Myrtle Vail, appears as Seymour's hypochondriac mother. Dick Miller, who had starred as the protagonist of A Bucket of Blood was offered the role of Seymour, but turned it down, instead taking the smaller role of Burson Fouch. Production at the Bucket of Blood sets was compressed into three days of cast rehearsals, immediately followed by two days <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>night</b> of principal photography.|$|E
5|$|A tribute video played next, {{highlighting}} the wrestlers from ECW that had died between the promotion's end in 2001 <b>and</b> <b>One</b> <b>Night</b> Stand.

5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to be born with some physical peculiarity, such as a caul, little wings or membranes beneath his armpits, a tail or teeth; or he was born an orphan. There were practices intended to preserve the supernatural power of the newborn dragon. In the region of Veles, Macedonia, twelve girls would pick cotton, spin yarn from it, weave a cloth from the yarn, made a shirt from the cloth, and finally dress the dragon boy in the shirt. As thought in the region of Leskovac, Serbia, such a boy would only then become able to defeat an ala, when three old women spun yarn, knitted a shirt, and dressed the child in it. All this had to be done in one day <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>night,</b> during which time the three women should not have spoken a single word. A similar custom was recorded in western Bulgaria, where it was also believed that the soul of the boy, while he slept in his cradle, left his body and walked around. If he was turned, he would die, as his soul could not return into his body.|$|E
5|$|Felicia Tilman (Harriet Sansom Harris), Martha’s sister, soon {{arrives on}} Wisteria Lane {{to find out}} what {{happened}} to her sister. While inside Paul and Mary Alice’s house, she recognizes a picture of Mary Alice and claims her to be Angela, a nurse she worked with years prior in Utah, but Paul is adamant that she is mistaken. Felicia, however, knows that Mary Alice was in fact Angela and later tells Zach that she knew him when he was a baby, and that his original name was so lovely: Dana. In the first season finale, the mystery behind Mary Alice’s suicide is revealed in full. In March 1990, Todd and Angela Forrest could not conceive <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>night</b> a woman named Deirdre Taylor (Jolie Jenkins), a heroin addict whom Angela had treated at the rehabilitation hospital where she worked as a nurse, came to their house looking for money and offered to sell her son to them, to which they eventually agreed. When Deirdre returned to the hospital as a patient soon after and suspicion arose as to where her child was, Angela knew they had to leave town. They moved to Fairview and bought a house on Wisteria Lane, changing their names to Paul, Mary Alice and Zach Young. In 1993, however, Deirdre came to their home, seemingly sober, demanding that she reclaim her son. After a verbal fight, Deirdre went to take her child, when Mary Alice stabbed and killed her. Zach woke up and saw the body, which led to years of his parents brushing off his memories of that night as nothing. Paul and Mary Alice dismembered Deirdre’s body, put it in a toy chest and buried it under their pool. Years later, Martha recognized Mary Alice in a group photo in Felicia’s house, leading to Felicia to tell Martha about how Angela and Todd possibly disappeared with Deirdre’s child and hopefully gave Dana a proper home. Martha then blackmailed Mary Alice and she, in desperation, committed suicide.|$|E

25|$|The {{best known}} {{work of fiction}} from the Islamic world is One Thousand and One Nights (In Persian: hezār-o-yek šab > Arabic: ʔalf-layl-at-wa-l’-layla= One {{thousand}} Night <b>and</b> (<b>one)</b> <b>Night)</b> or *Arabian Nights, a name invented by early Western translators, which is a compilation of folk tales from Sanskrit, Persian, and later Arabian fables. The original concept is derived from a pre-Islamic Persian prototype Hezār Afsān (Thousand Fables) that relied on particular Indian elements. It reached its final form by the 14th century; the number and type of tales have varied from one manuscript to another. All Arabian fantasy tales tend to be called Arabian Nights stories when translated into English, {{regardless of whether they}} appear in The Book of One Thousand and One Nights or not. This work has been very influential in the West since it was translated in the 18th century, first by Antoine Galland. Imitations were written, especially in France. Various characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as Aladdin, Sinbad the Sailor and Ali Baba.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, RTÉ {{decided to}} produce its first Dublin-based soap opera since the 1960s. Fair City, {{which is set}} in the fictional city of Carrickstown, {{initially}} aired one night a week during the 1989-90 season, and similar to its rural soaps, much of the footage was filmed on location – in a suburb of Dublin City. In 1992, RTÉ made a major investment into the series by copying the houses used in the on-location shoots for an on-site set in RTÉ's Headquarters in Dublin 4. By the early 1990s, it was airing two nights a week for 35 weeks a year. With competition from the UK soap operas, RTÉ expanded Fair City to three nights a week for most of the year <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>night</b> a week during the summer in 1996, later expanding to four nights a week and two nights during the summer. Until the early 2000s, the series produced four episodes a week, airing all 52 weeks of the year. Fair City airs Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8.00 p.m. GMT on RTÉ One; however, after rival network TV3 moved Coronation Street to Thursday night, the Wednesday night episode of Fair City began airing at 7:30p.m. each week.|$|E
