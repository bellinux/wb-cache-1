500|$|... "Don't Rush" [...] was {{originally}} written by Natalie Hemby and Blu Sanders in 2008. The idea of writing the song came from Hemby. She explained [...] "My friend Blu Sanders and I were together, and he goes, ‘Have you ever met Lindsay Champan?’ And I was like, ‘Nope!’ Basically he was like, ‘Why don’t we write with her? She has an absolutely gorgeous R voice.’ He was like ‘Let’s get together <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can develop." [...] Hemby also {{admitted that the}} song was written for Lindsay Chapman because the song's genre fit Chapman's musical direction at that time. She added, [...] "It had an Al Green-ish feel with a '70s throwback kind of vibe, and that's kind {{of what we were}} going for with her sound." [...] Once the collaboration was completed, the song was never recorded and Hemby said that it [...] "just kind of fell by the wayside". Being a good friend with Clarkson, Sanders decided to take the initiative to send the song with a few other songs to the singer.|$|E
500|$|In a January 20, 1990, contest against conference foe Tennessee, Pitino benched senior {{shooting}} guard Derrick Miller {{to start the}} second half, giving his spot to Farmer. Farmer, who had no assists and 4 turnovers in nine minutes during the first half, responded with 7 assists and only one turnover in the second half. Miller, who entered the game with 17:38 left, scored 17 {{points in the second}} half as the Wildcats turned a 4439 halftime deficit into a 9583 win. Miller credited Pitino's decision to bring him off the bench in the second half with taking the pressure off him and helping him get more comfortable in the game. After a mid-week loss to Auburn, Pitino announced that he would move Farmer into the starting lineup, replacing Sean Woods, for the Wildcats' January 27 contest against Ole Miss. [...] "We will change the lineup to try to get more concentration. We'll try Richie Farmer at the point <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> get out of that. Right now we're not getting too much out of that position," [...] Pitino told reporters during an SEC teleconference. In a 9879 victory, Farmer tallied 11 points, 2 assists and no turnovers in 24 minutes; Woods registered 8 points, 4 assists, and 2 turnovers in 23 minutes off the bench. Pitino said practice performance would determine whether Woods or Farmer would start the Wildcats' next game against Mississippi State, and he ultimately decided to return Woods to the starting rotation.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross was {{nominated}} for a BAFTA. According to The Times, Ross {{was nominated}} soon after he was banned. Melody Sachs complained about Ross being nominated so soon after the controversy in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying: [...] "I am amazed that Ross should get rewarded with a mouth like his. Nobody is saying he hasn't got talent, but what he did was so disgusting. Of course he is not worth the money, but he is good at his job. However, I don't think he should be rewarded so soon after what happened. It is like people are saying, 'Let's forget all about it <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can give him.' It is wrong and bad timing to give or even put up this guy for recognition when he has done such a terrible thing. It was unforgivable, really. I'm not angry, I just don't believe it." ...|$|E
